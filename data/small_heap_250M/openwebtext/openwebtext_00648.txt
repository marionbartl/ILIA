A generation of students facing higher tuition fees and lower job prospects appears to be embracing the mixed joys of budget travel in rising numbers – with the teenage dream of passing the test and driving a car now an increasingly unaffordable, minority pursuit.
Operators report that the traditional staples of budget travel, the young person's rail and coach cards, are being purchased in record numbers.
National Express, Britain's largest coach operator, reported a surge in sales of coach and regional bus discount cards last year, with 36% more being sold year on year.
Train companies said that record numbers of young people now have a railcard: over 1.2m were sold or renewed last year, almost a third higher than the 950,000 who had a discount railcard in 2005. The Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) said that 18-25 year-olds made over 50m journeys by rail last year, 60% up on five years ago.
Atoc spokesman Edward Welsh said: "We know a lot of under 25-year-olds are struggling to afford the costs of buying, running and insuring a car – and that's on top of paying for driving lessons."
The number of 17-year-olds taking the driving test has continued to fall year on year, as many of them deal with the loss of their education maintenance allowance coupled with a steep rise in university tuition fees. Nearly half of British 17-20 year-olds had driving licences two decades ago, but only 35% do now. Although the long-term slump in young people learning to drive eased slightly last year, the number of under-25s taking their driving test has fallen by over 20% in five years, according to Driving Standards Agency.
Rising fuel prices are dwarfed by rocketing car insurance premiums, which according to AA figures mean young men receive average insurance quotes of over £3,100.
At Victoria coach station in central London, student Lucy Hamer, 19, rolled her eyes when asked about driving. "I haven't learned to drive because it is far too expensive. I have to take the coach up to Liverpool and it's such a long journey, over five hours. The government really should be looking to cut the cost of driving but also public transport too. Every time I get on the bus it feels like the price has gone up."
Motoring organisations believe the economic conditions, rather than the emergence of a generation wilfully opposed to driving, are behind the rise in public transport use by young people. Edmund King, president of the AA, said: "You've got more young people going to university with tuition fees, and they basically don't have money to take lessons or insurance."
He maintained the dream of driving had not died. "There's still that desire, but financial circumstances have blunted the uptake. Despite the environmental talk and all else, I don't think the aspirations have changed that much."
The steep costs may have alarming effects. A recent survey for insurance firm Ingenie found that 89% of young drivers now take less than the recommended 40 hours of driving lessons before passing their test.
King warned of a vicious cycle for the non-driving young: "In times of high unemployment, it's quite useful for people to have a driving licence. For quite a few jobs, that's a prerequisite. And like learning to swim, it's easier the earlier you start. You'll end up paying even more."
If the coach has been the big winner from the age of travel austerity, not all passengers seem entirely enthusiastic, despite the promise of mod cons such as wifi, power sockets and leather seats aboard.
Also at Victoria coach station, Fay Ali, 23, an educational psychology student at Birkbeck, who paid £12.50 on the day for a single National Express journey to Sheffield, said: "I always intend to catch the train and then something happens so I'm left with nought options but to catch a coach. I had a train ticket booked but I missed it."
Alex Vardy-Meers, 25, a tree surgeon hauling his bags of tools, said that coach travel was the one thing that made his business viable. "Any money I earn would have to go straight into the costs of a car. The coach is OK. It would be easier to take a van but I can't afford that. If I didn't have a railcard I wouldn't ever take the train either."
But others have fallen in love with coach travel. Anne Wilkes, 66, a full-time carer for her husband, said it was also their favoured choice for European holidays. "If you're driving, you're low. On a coach you can see a lot more and I'm a nosy person. I like to see into people's gardens."
Carless whispers
Caroline Mortimer, 21, Harrogate, English student, University of Birmingham:
"Certainly the reason I don't drive, and haven't learned to drive, is the cost. I started taking lessons but I lost my job and couldn't afford to continue learning. I've always taken the train to travel between home and university and I do have a railcard, but I'm still forced to travel late at night when it's only £25 or at off-peak times as otherwise it's still too expensive. I can't take a coach either because it's not convenient where I live."
Nicholas Hughes, 21, from London, politics and economics student, University of Leeds:
"Living in London my need for driving isn't great, because the transport links are so good. However, at the same time, there's no doubt that the price of driving for young people – including lessons, insurance and petrol – is off-putting, and that's one reason why I haven't learned to drive. When I used to head up to university I would take the train, but even with a young person's railcard I feel that trains have become so expensive I've been priced out of those too. The coach is definitely much cheaper, and that's always how I travel back up to Leeds now."
Poonam Lad, 20, Ashton-under-Lyne, art student,Birmingham City University:
"I failed my test and it's far too expensive, if you fail, to have to pay for more lessons again. The cost can be hundreds of pounds. I take the train and the young person's railcard definitely makes a difference, and it's popular among students. A lot of students bank with NatWest, who provide the card for free when you open a student bank account. The NUS card is also helpful for discounts on the coach, but I still feel generally that the costs of travelling are too high at any age, not just students and young people."
Saoirse Linder, 20, Rostrevor (Northern Ireland), sociology student, University of Bristol:
"The cost of driving has been a big factor in deciding not to learn, and if you're a slow learner like myself it makes it that much more expensive. In Bristol, parking charges run into the hundreds of pounds too. Why would I drive when I can take a two-hour coach for a few pounds, and my university bus is free? Certainly railcard and NUS cards have an impact in that they are a hugely attractive alternative to driving, although whilst it is good that students have railcards you still have to pay for the railcard or your NUS card in the first place."
Country City/Location Date Deaths Notes
United Kingdom Faversham, Kent April 2, 1916 115 The Great Explosion: On April 2, 1916 a factory in Uplees, Faversham, exploded after a fire spread to a store of 25 tons of TNT and 700 tons of ammonium nitrate. The blast at the Explosives Loading Company killed 115 people and shattered windows in Southend-on-Sea across the Thames Estuary while the tremor was felt in Norwich.[1]
United States Morgan, New Jersey (now Sayreville) October 4, 1918 ~100 T. A. Gillespie Company Shell Loading Plant explosion: On October 4, 1918, an explosion at the Morgan Depot occurred leading to many artillery shells being launched into the air, some of which landed on a neighbouring warehouse where 4000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were stored in barrels. One of the shells caused a large explosion, but the majority of the ammonium nitrate did not detonate.
Germany Kriewald July 26, 1921 19 On July 26, 1921, in this railway town (now in Poland) workers tried to dislodge 30 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had aggregated (solidified into one mass) in two wagons. When mining explosives were used on this solid mass the wagons exploded and killed nineteen people.[2]
Germany Oppau September 21, 1921 561 Explosions at BASF plant Oppau: Another attempt at disaggregation of a fertilizer mix with industrial explosives caused the death of 561 people and left more than 2000 injured. The fertilizer was a 50:50 mixture of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate and the factory had used this method of disaggregation over 20,000 times without incident. It is thought that, on this occasion, poor mixing had led to certain parts of the mass containing more ammonium nitrate than others. Only 450 tonnes exploded, out of 4500 tonnes of fertilizer stored in the warehouse.[3]
United States Nixon, New Jersey
(now Edison Township) March 1, 1924 20 1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster: On March 1, 1924, a fire and several large explosions destroyed a warehouse containing ammonium nitrate at the Nixon Nitration Works. The explosiveness of the product was perhaps enhanced, as it had been prepared using nitric acid that had previously been used for the production of TNT.
United States Muscle Shoals, Alabama 1925 0 On April 4, 1925, and May 3, 1925, two carloads, each containing 220 barrels of ammonium nitrate, were dispatched from Muscle Shoals, Alabama and caught fire in transportation. The barrels had been stored in a warehouse with varying humidity for 6 years, so it is believed that they were ignited by friction with their nitrate-impregnated manila paper lining. Other shipments were reportedly more successful.[4]
France Miramas August 5, 1940 0 240 tonnes of ammonium nitrate in sacks exploded after being hit by a shell from a nearby fire in a munitions train.[5]
Belgium Tessenderlo April 29, 1942 189 Another attempt to disaggregate a pile of 150 tonnes of ammonium nitrate with industrial explosives ended tragically on April 29, 1942: 189 people were killed, 900 wounded.[6]
United States Texas City April 16, 1947 581 Texas City disaster: The cargo ship Grandcamp was being loaded on April 16, 1947, when a fire was detected in the hold: at this point, 2300 tons of ammonium nitrate in sacks were already aboard.[7] The captain responded by closing the hold and pumping in pressurised steam. One hour later, the ship exploded, killing several hundred people and setting fire to another vessel, the High Flyer, which was moored 250 metres away and which contained 1050 tonnes of sulfur and 960 tons of ammonium nitrate. The Grandcamp explosion also created a powerful earthshock that broke windows as far as 40 miles away and knocked two small planes flying at 1,500 feet (460 m) out of the sky. The High Flyer exploded the next day, after having burned for sixteen hours. 500 tonnes of ammonium nitrate on the quayside also burned, but without exploding, probably because it was less tightly packed. All but one member of the Texas City fire department died.
France Brest July 28, 1947 29 The cargo ship Ocean Liberty was loaded with 3300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and various flammable products when it caught fire at 12:30 July 28, 1947. The captain ordered the hold to be sealed and pressurised steam was pumped in. As this did not stop the fire, the vessel was towed out of the harbour at 14:00, and exploded at 17:00. The explosion caused 29 deaths and serious damage to the port of Brest.[8]
- Red Sea 1953 0 A fire was detected on the cargo ship Tirrenia on January 23, 1953, while it was carrying 4000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. Attempts to extinguish the fire with steam were unsuccessful, and the ship was abandoned before it exploded later in the night.[9]
United States Roseburg, Oregon August 7, 1959 14 The Roseburg Blast: A truck carrying dynamite and ammonium nitrate caught fire early in the morning of August 7, 1959. When it exploded it killed 14 people and injured 125 more. Several blocks of downtown Roseburg were destroyed. The accident is locally referred to as "The Blast".
United States Traskwood, Arkansas December 17, 1960 0 On December 17, 1960, a 96 freight car train suffered partial derailment, in which the last 23 cars were derailed. The derailed cars included: four fuel oil tank cars, two tank cars of gasoline, three tank cars of petroleum oil, four cars of lube oil drums, three cars of liquid fertilizer, one car of fuming nitric acid and two cars of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate. In this particular accident, neither car of ammonium nitrate exploded.[10] However, the nitric acid reacted with the fuel oil, essentially creating ANFO to feed the conflagration, resulting in the spread of the ammonium nitrate material around the incident site.[11]
Australia Taroom, Queensland August 30, 1972 3 A truck carrying ammonium nitrate experienced an electrical fault and caught fire north of Taroom. After the driver stopped and parked the burning truck, two brothers from a nearby cattle property who saw the fire rode up on motorbikes to assist. The three men were killed when the truck exploded. The explosion burnt out more than 2000 acres of surrounding bushland, and left a deep crater where the truck had been parked. A memorial to the three men was unveiled at the accident site in 2013.[12] [13] [14] [15]
United States Kansas City, Missouri November 29, 1988 6 On November 29, 1988, at 4:07 AM two trailers containing approximately 50,000 lb (23,000 kg) of the explosive ANFO (ammonium nitrate with fuel oil) exploded at a construction site located near the 87th street exit of Highway 71 in Kansas City, Missouri. The explosives were to be used in the blasting of rock while constructing Highway 71. The result of the explosions were the deaths of six firemen from the Kansas City Fire Department's Pumper Companies 30 and 41. Both companies were dispatched after 911 calls indicated that a pickup truck located near the trailers had been set on fire. The responding companies were warned that there were explosives on-site; however, they were unaware that the trailers were essentially magazines filled with explosives. At 4:07 AM one of the "magazines" caught fire and a catastrophic explosion occurred, killing all six firemen instantly — only sparing remains were found. A second blast occurred 40 minutes later, although all fire crews had been pulled back at this time. The blasts created two craters, each approximately 100 feet (30 m) wide and 8 feet (2.4 m) deep. The explosions also shattered windows within a 10-mile (16 km) area and could be heard 40 miles (64 km) away. It was later determined that the explosions were acts of arson, set by individuals embroiled in a labor dispute with the construction company contracted to build the highway.[16][17]
Papua New Guinea Porgera Gold Mine August 2, 1994 11 At 9:45 am, 2 August 1994, 11 workers were killed when they sensitised AN emulsion plant they were working on exploded at the Porgera Gold Mine. The fatal explosion involved at most a few tonnes of explosive. A larger explosion of about 80 tonnes of emulsion (Ammonium Nitrate Emulsion, ANE, UN 3375) was caused by fires under storage facilities at the site at 11:02 AM. There were no fatalities in the second explosion because the site had been evacuated. A mushroom cloud was seen to rise.[18] ANE is an emulsion of ammonium nitrate, fuel and water.
United States Port Neal, Iowa December 13, 1994 4 Port Neal fertilizer plant explosion: At about 6:06 AM on December 13, 1994, two explosions rocked the Port Neal, Iowa, ammonium nitrate processing plant operated by Terra Industries. Four people were killed and 18 injured. Approximately 5,700 tons of anhydrous ammonia were released and releases of ammonia continued for six days after the explosions. Groundwater under the processing plant was contaminated by chemicals released as a result of the blast. The timing of the explosion occurred prior to the start of the arrival of the 8:00 AM shift personnel, or the death toll might have been larger.[19][20]
China Xingping, Shaanxi January 6, 1998 22 At midnight on January 6, 1998, the Xinghua Fertilizer company had a series of explosions in the plant. About 27.6 tons of ammonium nitrate liquor was in a container there. The explosion claimed 22 lives, with a further 56 wounded. The explosion was officially announced as an accident.[21][ citation needed ]
France Toulouse September 21, 2001 31 AZF: On September 21, 2001, at 10:15 AM, in the AZF (Azote de France) fertiliser factory in Toulouse, France, an explosion occurred in a warehouse where the off-specification granular AN was stored flat, separated by partitions. About 200–300 tons were said to be involved in the explosion, resulting in 31 people dead and 2,442 injured, 34 of them seriously. The blast wave shattered windows up to 3 km away, and the resulting crater was 10 m deep and 50 m wide. The exact cause remains unknown. The material damage was estimated at 2.3 billion euros. France's Environment Minister initially suggested the explosion "may have been a terrorist attack" as it occurred soon after the September 11 attacks and one worker may have had militant views.
Spain Cartagena, Murcia January 2003 0 The fertilizer storage facility of Fertiberia held a self-sustained decomposition (SSD) fire in January 2003. The fire was controlled after most of the material was removed by mechanical means.[ citation needed ]
France Saint-Romain-en-Jarez October 2, 2003 0 A fire broke out in Saint-Romain-en-Jarez (Loire) in a barn, which at the time of the accident contained a gasoline-powered forklift, a battery charger, two 13-kg gas bottles, miscellaneous farm machinery, 500 kg of quicklime, 500 wooden crates, 6,000 to 7,000 plastic crates,and between 3 and 5 tonnes of ammonium nitrate packaged in big-bags. Bales of hay and straw were being stored on the mezzaanine and ≈500 kg apples kept in the cold storage rooms. The fire started around 3 PM, and fire-fighters were notified of the blaze at 4:02 PM. They arrived on the scene at 4:23 and started to extinguish the fire. At 5:12 PM the explosion occurred. Twenty six people were injured from the blast, most of them fire-fighters.[22]
Spain Barracas March 9, 2004 2 A truck carrying 25 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertilizer exploded half an hour after a traffic accident on March 9, 2004, killing two people and injuring five others. The explosion, which could be heard at a distance of several kilometers caused a crater five metres deep.[23]
Romania Mihăileşti, Buzău May 24, 2004 18 Mihăileşti explosion: A truck carrying 20 tonnes of ammonium nitrate tipped over on the European road E85 near Mihăileşti at 4:57 AM on May 24, 2004. Shortly afterwards, a fire started in the cabin. Two reporters got to the site of the accident and started filming while firemen were trying to stop the fire. Around 5:50 AM the truck exploded, killing 18 and wounding 13 people. A crater 6.5 meters deep and 42 meters in diameter was formed by the explosion.
North Korea Ryongchŏn April 22, 2004 162 Ryongchon disaster: A freight train carrying ammonium nitrate exploded in this important railway town near the Chinese border on April 22, 2004, killing 162 people and injuring over 3,000 others. The train station was destroyed, as were most buildings within 500 metres, and nearly 8,000 homes were destroyed or damaged. Two craters of about ten metres in depth were seen at the site of the explosion. The authorities blamed "human error" for the explosion, although rumours persist that it was in fact an attempt to assassinate the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il, who was due to be passing through the station at the time.
Spain Estaca de Bares 2007 0 The NPK fertilizer cargo of the ship Ostedijk sustained a self-sustained decomposition (SSD) fire for 11 days. The fire plume reached 10 m in diameter and several hundred meters in length. Special water spears were inserted inside the cargo to extinguish the fire.[24]
Mexico Monclova, Coahuila September 10, 2007 40 On September 10, 2007, near Monclova, Coahuila, México, a pickup truck lost control and crashed into a trailer loaded with 22 tons of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil explosives (ANFO) leaving three occupants in the pick-up truck dead in the crash. A fire then started in the trailer's cabin and approximately 40 minutes after that, a huge explosion occurred, resulting in 37 deaths and around 150 more people injured. A crater 30 ft (9.1 m) wide and 6 ft (1.8 m) deep was created due to the explosion.[25]
United States Bryan, Texas July 30, 2009 0 A plant in Bryan, Texas (El Dorado Chemical Company), which processes ammonium nitrate into fertilizer, caught fire at about 11:40 AM on July 30, 2009. Over 80,000 residents in the Bryan/College Station area were asked to evacuate south of town due to the toxic fumes this fire generated. Texas A&M University provided shelter at Reed Arena, a local venue on campus. Only minor injuries were reported.[26][27]
United States West, Texas April 17, 2013 15 West Fertilizer Company explosion: A fertilizer company in West, Texas, caught fire. Around 20 minutes later, ammonium nitrate stored there exploded, leveling roughly 80 homes and a middle school. 133 residents of a nearby nursing home were trapped in the ruins. In all, 15 were killed, and about 200 injured. There were reports that the facility had stored more ammonium nitrate than it was allowed to, without regulation by the Department of Homeland Security.[28][29]
Australia Wyandra, Queensland September 6, 2014 0 A truck carrying 56 tonnes rolled on a rural road, exploding shortly after the driver was rescued. The explosion was heard 30 km away with debris being thrown 2 km, it totally destroyed a highway bridge. The driver and 6 firemen were injured.[30]
Funding Open Source Mathematical Software in the United States
Why: Because Sage is Hobbling Along
Something that is Missing
Searching for a Funding Model
SageMath, Inc.
I doknow how to get funding for open source mathematical software in the United States. However, I'm trying.Despite what we might think in our Sage-developer bubble, Sage is hobbling along, and without an infusion of financial support very soon, I think the project is going to fail in the next few years. I have access to Google analytics data for sagemath.org since 2007, and there has been no growth in active users of the website since 2011:The worse part of all for me, after ten years, is seeing things like this email today from John Palmieri, where he talks about writing slow but interesting algebraic topology code, and needing help from somebody who knows Cython to actually make his code fast.I know from my three visits to the Magma group in Sydney that such assistance is precisely what having real financial support can provide. Such money makes it possible to have fulltime people who know the tools and how to optimize them well, and they work on this sort of speedup and integration -- this "devil is in the details" work -- for each major contribution (they are sort of like a highly skilled version of a journal copy editor and referee all in one). Doing this makes a massive difference, but also costs on the order of $1 million / year to have any real impact. 1 million is probably the Magma budget to support around 10 people and periodic visitors, and of course like 1% of the budget of Matlab/Mathematica. Magma has this support partly because Magma is closed source, and maintains tight control on who may use it.Sage is open source and freely available to all, so it is of potential huge value to the community by being owned by everybody and changeable. However, those who fund Magma (either directly or indirectly) haven't funded Sage at the same level for some reason. I can't make Sage closed source and copy that very successful funding model. I've tried everything I can think of given the time and resources I have, and the only model left that seems able to support open source is having a company that doeswell and makes money, then using some of the profit to fund open source ( Intel is the biggest contributor to Linux ).Since I failed to find any companies that passionately care about Sage like Intel/Google/RedHat/etc. care about Linux, I started one. I've been working on SageMathCloud extremely hard for over 3 years now, with the hopes that at least it could be a way to fund Sage development.
Vanishing stars that ‘disappear' suddenly from the universe without any ‘rational' scientific explanation could point to the existence of extraterrestrial life, scientists have suggested.. According to researchers, the disappearance of stars of galaxies could be a clue that suggests the existence of highly advanced alien civilizations. Interestingly, researchers have found ONE object that defies explanation.
A new study suggests that ‘impossible' vanishing stars could be the ultimate evidence of advanced alien lifeforms in the universe. Basically, vanishing stars that ‘disappear' suddenly from the universe without any ‘rational' scientific explanation could point to the existence of extraterrestrial life, scientists have suggested.
Astronomers propose to search for physically impossible effects caused by highly advanced technology, by carrying out a search for disappearing galaxies and Milky Way stars.
After analyzing almost 300,000 stars, a group of Swedish scientists has found a celestial object that perhaps could shed light on extraterrestrial life in the universe.
Scientists at the University of Uppsala (Sweden) have proposed a whole new method to search for signs of advanced alien civilizations, reports the British magazine New Scientist. The surprising idea consists in registering the missing stars or galaxies.
While the study says that the search for extraterrestrial civilizations usually focuses on possible signs of ‘Astroengineering,' Swedish researchers propose we should start paying more attention to “physically impossible effects caused by a highly advanced technology.”
Interestingly, astronomers analyzed nearly 300,000 stars according to data from multiple surveys of the sky in the search for missing stars and galaxies. Scientists selected 148 celestial bodies, almost all of which were discarded during the study due to errors or imprecision of the telescopes at the time of registration.
So far results from the study are mixed. They have potentially discovered one artifact of interest that appears as if though it may have vanished, however, astronomers are still unsure. „It was a depressing case in the sense that we neither could reject it and neither could we say that it was a real candidate,“ says Beatriz Villarroel from the Uppsala University in Sweden.
Beatriz Villarroel, author of the experiment, along with her colleagues plans to look for the celestial object that disappeared through more powerful telescopes. If they fail to find the star or ‘fingerprints' of its existence, they can rule out astrophysical phenomena with more certainty and declare that the celestial body disappeared, which will allow for researchers to speculate about ‘Aliens.'
According to Jay Olsen at Boise State University, its a very reasonable thing to do. Olsen says that: „It's a deliberate search for something very unusual which could be hiding in existing data across time. At this stage of the game, it's a very limited search, but it illustrates well what can be accomplished.“
The object Villarroel and her colleagues are searching for are nothing like Tabby's Star, the mystery star that dips in brightness making headlines last year when some researchers proposed that alien megastructures could be the culprit. The objects Villarroel and her colleagues are searching for would not display physical culprits behind their disappearance –since it is not possible for something to suddenly disappear from the universe without leaving behind any traces. Villarroel and her colleagues invoke Arthur C. Clarke's third law which says that: „ Any Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.“
In other words, Villarroel and her colleagues are primarily searching for things that apparently are IMPOSSIBLE.

A university vice chancellor has issued a stinging rebuke to a Conservative MP's attempts to compile a “sinister” list of academics who are teaching about Brexit, telling him: “We will never surrender”.
Professor David Green, vice chancellor of the University of Worcester, said Chris Heaton-Harris' efforts to find out what universities are teaching their students about Brexit had sent “a chill down my spine” and suggested they constitute “a British McCarthyism”.
Mr Heaton-Harris was widely criticised for sending a letter to UK universities requesting they provide him with the names of professors who are teaching about Brexit, as well as a copy of their syllabus.
In response, Professor Green told The Independent the letter was “chilling and sinister” and demanded that Theresa May immediately sack Mr Heaton-Harris as a government whip.
He said: “This is an outrageous attack on elementary freedoms and it is very important that it is resisted.
“A decent prime minister would sack him immediately as a whip…He should no longer be a member of the government.”
Professor Green had earlier invoked Winston Churchill in vowing to fight “the power of tyranny”.
He said: “When I read this extraordinary letter on parliamentary paper from a serving MP, I felt a chill down my spine. Was this the beginnings of a very British McCarthyism?
“I realised that his letter just asking for information appears so innocent but is really so, so dangerous. Here is the first step to the thought police, the political censor and Newspeak, naturally justified as ‘the will of the British people' - another phrase to be found on Mr Heaton-Harris's website.
“Then I thought that only one response was appropriate, which Churchill spoke so brilliantly for all who love Britain and democracy when he said we shall outlive the power of tyranny' and ‘we shall never surrender”. That is my reply to Mr Heaton-Harris MP's sinister letter.”
He told The Independent: “I love this country and I love liberty, and I for one am going to do absolutely everything I can to oppose this outrageous attack by him on freedom.
“He is abusing his power. He is a government whip and a Member of Parliament. He has responsibilities to democracy that he appears to have forgotten.”
Asked what he thought the Conservative MP was hoping to achieve with his letter, Professor Green said: “I have little doubt that he wants to get a list of people who are the ‘guilty' people who, he will argue, have betrayed Britain. He is trying to engage in some form of whipping up of hatred.”
The academic, who is hoping for a letter of apology from the MP, said he feared Mr Heaton-Harris could use his position in Parliament to attack academics if they fail to provide him with the information he has requested.
Professor Green said: “If I don't, is he planning to use Parliament to denounce me as an ‘enemy of the people'?”
As other academics joined the condemnation, it also emerged that Mr Heaton-Harris may have breached EU law with his attempts to find out what universities are teaching about Brexit.
A group of students studying for master's degrees in Politics and the Political Economy of Europe at the London School of Economics (LSE) have written to the MP accusing him of violating the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes statements on academic freedom.
In a letter seen by The Independent, they say: “Since the United Kingdom is still a Member State of the EU, you are obliged as a working politician to respect and follow the European Union treaties. It is stated in Article 13 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights that ‘the arts and scientific research shall be free of constraint. Academic freedom shall be respected'.
“Your action by asking academics to provide information of the teaching and researching of Brexit issues is in breach of this article as you are inputting political pressure which undermines our ability as autonomous institutions, academics and students to exercise our right to freedom of education, which is increasing our academic vulnerability and legally breaching not only the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights A bit also the UNESCO declaration of 1997 [on academic freedom].”
They add: “We sincerely hope that you will reconsider your action in monitoring university teaching in European Affairs, and will leave students and academics to express and exercise their right and freedom to education."
On Wednesday In Atlanta three people were killed in three separate shootings in the southwest. Police do not believe they were connected, but all happened within a five-mile radius to each other. The last incident happened on Smith Street where three men were shot as they stood on the street. A 22-year-old man died. The others were hit in the leg and expected to survive. The murdered man was the uncle and promoter of a child rapper who is popular online. The family of Lil Money said he died protecting his 6-year-old nephew, known to many in Atlanta as Bankroll PJ. Bankroll PJ became an internet sensation after he was recorded counting $100 bills. The 6-year-old has nearly half a million Instagram followers and his hit “Jump In” has been viewed nearly a million times on YouTube. Posted By Persist
The Royals announced today that designated hitter Kendrys Morales and right-hander Edinson Volquez have declined their halves of their 2017 mutual options. Additionally, the team has declined its half of the mutual option on right-hander Kris Medlen. All three players will enter the free-agent market. It's still possible that the Royals could make a $17.2MM qualifying offer to either Volquez or Morales, though Rustin Dodd of the Kansas City Star tweets that neither is likely. (That's no surprise in the case of Volquez, though there was a bit more of a possibility in Morales' case.)
Morales, 33, will enter the offseason with the strongest free-agent case. After an ice-cold start to the season, the switch-hitting slugger caught fire in June and finished out the year with a torrid .302/.364/.547 batting line and 24 homers in his final 404 trips to the plate. While that endpoint is admittedly arbitrary, Morales' scorching summer demonstrated that he's still capable of performing at a high level. That he'll hit the market without being burdened by a qualifying offer should allow him to find at least a healthy two-year deal this winter — likely to serve as a DH and occasional first baseman elsewhere in the American League.
The Royals will have a hole at DH, of course, bur a reunion doesn't seem to be in the cards given GM Dayton Moore's statements about the team's payroll regressing in 2017. The Red Sox, Blue Jays, Orioles, White Sox and Rangers are among the American League clubs that could have a first base/DH opening in 2017.
Volquez, also 33, had a strong first season in Kansas City (3.55 ERA in 200 1/3 innings) but was unable to replicate that success in the second season of his two-year, $20MM pact with Kansas City. The 2016 campaign, Volquez's worst since 2013, saw the veteran right-hander limp to a 5.37 ERA with 6.6 K/9, 3.6 BB/9 and a 51.2 percent ground-ball rate. His year was in some ways the inverse of Morales' 2016 season. The righty got off to a nice start (3.74 ERA through May 29) but saw his season completely collapse from that point forth. Volquez was tattooed for a 6.27 ERA over his final 122 innings, yielding 85 earned runs on 147 hits and 53 walks (plus six hit batsmen) in that time.
Given that dreadful skid, it's at least somewhat surprising that Volquez was the one who declined his end of a $10MM mutual option, but given the dearth of quality rotation options on the open market this winter, he could still come away with a nice contract. He's one season removed from a two-year stretch in which he posted a collective 3.30 ERA in 393 innings, and even in a dreadful 2016 season, Volquez logged 189 1/3 frames. Durability pays on the open market, and Volquez's camp can pitch him as the most reliable source of 190+ innings available in free agency in an offseason market where the headliners include Rich Hill, Jeremy Hellickson and Ivan Nova.
Medlen, meanwhile, was signed prior to the 2015 season as a reclamation project on the heels of his second career Tommy John surgery, but his two-year deal ultimately provided little to return on Kansas City's $8.5MM investment. After tossing just 58 1/3 innings in 2015, Medlen was slowed by a pair of shoulder injuries in 2016 and managed to take the hill for just 24 1/3 frames of 7.77 ERA ball. It doesn't seem that long ago that Medlen looked to be blossoming into a potential front-of-the-rotation starter with the Braves, but the 2.47 ERA he posted in 335 innings over a two-year span came all the way back in 2012-13. It's now been three full seasons since Medlen was an effective Major League pitcher, and while some teams figure to look at him as a low-cost roll of the proverbial dice this winter, he may have to earn his roster spot and earn a significant portion of his 2017 salary via performance incentives.
Elon Musk is in China this week, where he told an audience at Tsinghua University that his company will begin building the upcoming Model 3 “affordable Tesla” in a Chinese factory within 2 years, according to Sina Technology. That marks a wholesale shift in how Tesla plans to sell its cars in China. Until now, all its cars were built in Fremont, California and imported.
Tesla made a big splash when it started selling the Model S sedan in China two years ago. News that the company was about to tap into the world's largest market for new cars sent its stock soaring. But a funny thing happened on the way to the Imperial Palace; its sales projections proved grossly optimistic. Chinese customers complained that there were too few places to plug in their expensive new vehicles. But the biggest problem was that Tesla did not fully understand the cultural component of selling cars in China.
China is a really big country will lots and lots of people and most of those people live in huge cities. Let's put that into perspective. There are 9 cities in America with a population of more than a million. China has 106, with more being built all the time. An automobile is not much good if you can't drive it on public streets. Unless you plan to live in it, you also need a place to park it.
In China, you don't just buy a new car and then hop over to the Registry of Motor Vehicles and pick up your license plates. Oh, no. First, you have to prove to government officials that you have a parking place for your new ride. After that, you have to enter a lottery to get a registration for the car. Some Chinese drivers wait up to 5 years before they get their car licensed and on the road. But if you have an electric car, you move to the head of the line and can get your registration immediately. Unless your electric is imported. Then you go to the back of the line again. Oh, dear.
China also imposes significant import duties on cars manufactured in other countries. That's why General Motors, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Volvo, Jeep and every other manufacturer in the world have been making cars for the Chinese market in China for the past decade. If you want to sell in China, you need to partner with a Chinese company.
As a result, Chinese car buyers have become accustomed to driving automobiles made in China. The upshot is, if you want to sell cars in China that are affordable, you need to create a partnership with a domestic manufacturer. But Tesla is a disruptor, remember? It does not consider itself bound by what everybody else does. It prefers to chart its own course. Except in this case, it's course went off road, through the woods, across some rocks, and over a cliff. Now it has apparently seen the light and will amend its ways.
Tesla says its Chinese factory will utilize exactly the same technology employed at its factory in Fremont. That should result in a Model 3 that cost about $35,000, has a range of 200 miles or more, and comes with no import duties. It will also satisfy Chinese customers that they are buying a domestically manufactured car and Chinese regulators that it qualifies for preference when it comes to registering the car.
Call it Tesla Chinese Sales Strategy 2.0. Even disruptors are constrained by reality sometimes.

Expect more pizza ordering options on your video game consoles, based on the success of Pizza Hut's Xbox 360 app that launched last year. Within the first four months of the Pizza Hut app's existence, it did more than $1 million in business through Xbox Live, the company said.
"It's been a source of unbelievable growth for us," said Doug Terfehr, director of public relations for Pizza Hut, in an interview with Polygon. "Just the explosion of people who wanted to download it, experiment with it, play with it with Kinect. As soon as we did one, everyone was contacting us to do the next [one]."
Pizza Hut reps wouldn't say when it would pursue another game console app on, say, Xbox One or any of the PlayStation or Nintendo platforms, saying, "Conversations continue to be ongoing with us. Wherever you are, we want to be."
More pizza-ordering apps are on the company's road map, but may be far off in the future, meaning many of us will be forced to order food through more traditional, non-video game console means. Pizza Hut is focusing on improving its iOS and Android apps, Terfehr said, to match the experience on Xbox. Reps also say they're hoping for a larger install base on Xbox One before bringing their order app to Microsoft's new console.
"When you talk about a sweet spot for the pizza category it's definitely gamers and gaming," Terfehr said. "We're not done in that space."
Pizza Hut was in attendance at CES this week to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the world's first online order, which it says was through its PizzaNet website.
Snake catcher says housing boom squeezing out reptile release sites in Melbourne's west
Posted
As the weather warms up, more Melburnians are getting out and about — and that includes the city's snakes.
Snake catcher Adam Sapiano said this year's snake season had started earlier than usual.
"Normally it's the first weekend of September ... but this year certainly started midway through August," he told 774 ABC Melbourne's George McEncroe.
What to do if you find a snake Leave it alone — it will defend itself if provoked or threatened
If it is in your yard, bring pets and children inside
If it is inside, shut the doors to the room and place a towel at the bottom of the door
Your local council will have contacts for your nearest snake catcher
Based in Melbourne's western suburbs, Mr Sapiano is kept busy in the warmer months removing and relocating snakes from suburban backyards.
"I'll be honest, it's getting a lot harder to relocate these animals now," he said.
That, he said, was because places he once released the snakes were now housing estates built to accommodate western Melbourne's booming population.
According to the Bureau of Statistics, two of Victoria's five fastest growing suburbs are in Melbourne's west.
Caught snakes must be released nearby
Mr Sapiano said conditions on his wildlife licence dictated that all the animals he caught must be released nearby.
"We relocate all the animals we catch within five kilometres of the catch site," he said.
"That's obviously getting a lot more difficult now with the developments and the housing estates going up."
Mr Sapiano said he became a snake catcher after growing up in Melbourne's west catching blue tongue lizards at his local river.
"A lot of the places I grew up catching them and finding them are now all housing estates."
Luckily, not all Mr Sapiano's jobs require him to release his catch.
"I had a call at about two o'clock in the morning from a resident in Tullamarine who believed they had a snake on the bonnet of their car," he said.
"When I walked over, it was a rubber rattlesnake."

Close on the heels of the revelation that Samsung's NX300M camera runs Tizen, this week saw an announcement by Nexcom of a developer-focused, Intel Atom-based automotive computer called the VTC 1010-IVI that supports the Tizen In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) stack, plus news of a Tizen-enabled Samsung smart refrigerator. Meanwhile, Samsung's first Tizen phones are rumored to be under test at Korean mobile carriers.
As we await the first phones to run the Linux Foundation's open source Linux based Tizen OS, the focus has been on Samsung. Yet there's another tech giant quietly backing the platform: Intel. Tizen has always been claimed to support both ARM and x86, and now for the first time we're seeing action on the x86 front. Nexcom announced an Intel Atom-based IVI vehicle computer that supports the Tizen IVI stack, in addition to various Windows flavors (see farther below for full details).
First, as to those oft-delayed Tizen phones, according to ZDNet Korea, on Nov. 19 Samsung began testing its Tizen phone with an unnamed Korean carrier. As Unwired View speculated this would appear to keep the phone on track for a first half 2014 release.
Meanwhile, another ZDNet Korea story posted yesterday quotes Samsung engineer Elvin Kim as saying Tizen and Android will coexist rather than Tizen becoming the primary platform. The story also says, however, that Tizen “will be presented to the market starting at the end of next year.”
Samsung Tizen refrigerator tipped
Samsung's first Tizen-based refrigerator was tipped by ddaily.co.kr (Google translation), which sources an unnamed Samsung official as saying Samsung will formally unveil the product on Jan. 7 at the CES show in Las Vegas. Several photos (below) were also posted at ddaily.co.kr and elsewhere, but it's unclear if they are of the new Tizen refrigerator or of other Samsung “smart refrigerator” models.

The Samsung's “smart refrigerator” will run Tizen on a Nexell application processor, and will feature 256MB to 512MB DDR2 RAM, as well as flash memory and WiFi, says the story. Nexell offers an ARM11 system-on-chip, as well as two Cortex-A9 SoCs, including a 28nm-fabricated quad-core model called the NXP4330Q.
Samsung's other announced Tizen device: the NX300M camera
At we reported earlier this month, Samsung revealed its very first Tizen-based device at the Tizen Developer Summit: the Samsung NX300M camera. The camera reportedly first shipped a “month or so” ago, but Samsung had not previously disclosed that it was using an embedded Tizen OS.

The 20.3-megapixel mirrorless NX300M is an updated version of a previous model. The $850 camera is further equipped with a 3.31-inch AMOLED touchscreen with a 180 degree swivel, as well as an APS-C sensor that enables 9fps continuous shooting, and an 100-25,600 ISO range. Further details (in Korean) are available on Samsung's NX300M product page.
Nexcom VTC 1010-IVI system
Nexcom's VTC 1010-IVI system is the first IVI product we've seen that runs Tizen, and the first Tizen product to run on an x86 processor. The car computer is a development and prototyping platform designed to let automakers “explore and validate design ideas without developing an IVI system from the ground up and therefore to narrow the time gap between concept and commercialization,” stated Steven Wu, GM of Mobile Computing Solutions Nexcom.

The feature set appears to point to trucking and commercial fleet applications, rather than consumer autos. It was recently revealed that Toyota and Jaguar/Land Rover are both working on vehicles with Tizen IVI systems.
Nexcom does not refer to the system as an official Intel Atom development platform for Tizen IVI, but it appears to be the only such platform commercially available. Intel also supplied a testimonial in Nexcom's announcement of the device: “As a major contributor to the Tizen IVI project, Intel is delighted to have the NEXCOM VTC 1010-IVI available to the open source ecosystem for development of advanced connected vehicle technologies” stated Mark Skarpness, director, Systems Engineering, Software and Services Group at Intel Corp.
The VTC 1010-IVI supports the Tizen In-Vehicle Infotainment (Tizen IVI) software platform, which enables a vehicle to become “an information desk, a media service center, a Wi-Fi hotspot and even a mobile diagnostic center,” says Nexcom. Capabilities available in the Tizen IVI stack include news, real-time traffic information, navigation, on-demand multimedia streaming services, remote vehicle management, telephony, and other connected services, says the company.
The VTC 1010-IVI runs Tizen or various Windows flavors on an Intel Atom E3827 processor from the Bay Trail-I embedded strain of new Silvermont architecture Atoms. The dual-core SoC runs at 1.75GHz, yet has a fairly modest 8W TDP. The SoC also brings Intel AES New Instructions security technology to the IVI device.
The 180 x 180 x 50mm (7.1 x 7.1 x 2.0-inch) system is equipped with 2GB of DDR3 RAM, expandable to 8GB, and there's an SD slot for expansion. The IVI system also includes a 2.5-inch SATA bay, and four mini-PCIe expansion slots to support “3G/4G networks, Wi-Fi tethering, and Bluetooth pairing with mobile devices,” says Nexcom. Dual SIM slots are also available for popping in cellular cards.
Like any good IVI system, it offers built-in GPS, and it also provides a variety of 9-axis sensors. Front-facing I/O includes a USB 3.0 port and audio jacks. In the back you can find a USB 2.0 port, while additional USB connections are available via the mini-PCIe slots. Rear I/O also includes a gigabit Ethernet port, as well as a VGA, a DisplayPort, more audio I/O, and an RS232 port.
More serial connections are available from a 60-pin LHF connector, which also supports a CAN bus and general programmable I/O. Connections can be found for two optional modules: an OBD-II diagnostics module and a dead reckoning navigation module.
The OBD-II module can be set up to report to a cloud server to allow for real-time vehicle status and remote vehicle control, says Nexcom. This option also lets users call emergency services. A video capture card add-on also plugs into this 60-pin connector.
The VTC 1010-IVI can endure temperatures of -30 to 70°C and can resist vibration and shock based on military standard 810G, says Nexcom. Intelligent vehicle power management features and wake-up on ignition are also said to be available.
Nexcom's VTC 1010-IVI system appears to be available now at an unstated price. More information may be found at Nexcom's VTC 1010-IVI product page.

NBCUniversal's head of research had a surprise for reporters Wednesday during a presentation on the challenges of measuring TV viewing: ratings estimates for a handful of Netflix series and Amazon's “Man in the High Castle.”
Alan Wurtzel, NBCU president of research and media development, presented ratings estimates for a handful of SVOD shows in an effort to give reporters a sense of the audience that Netflix and Amazon draw. He urged reporters to put the impact of SVOD competition in “perspective” when writing about how new digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business, broadcast networks in particular.
Wurtzel cited ratings derived from San Francisco-based tech firm Symphony, which measures TV viewing using audio content recognition technology — software loaded on to users phones that tracks viewership by capturing the soundtrack of the program. The company has a sample size of about 15,000 at present, Wurtzel said.
From September through December, the average episode of Netflix's “Jessica Jones” averaged 4.8 million viewers in adults 18-49 during a 35-day viewing cycle, according to Wurtzel's presentation. Aziz Ansari's “Master of None” (produced by Universal TV) grabbed 3.9 million while “Narcos” grabbed 3.2 million during the same frame. Amazon's “Man in the High Castle,” a show that Amazon has identified as its highest-rated original series, averaged 2.1 million.

During the September-December period, Netflix's “Orange Is the New Black” averaged 644,000 viewers. That reflected the fact that the show's most recent third season launched in June. “OITNB” has been tabbed by Netflix as its most-watched original series.
Wurtzel shared the Symphony ratings estimates as part of what he called a “Netflix Reality Check.” He said the goal was not to get down the decimal point of viewership for Netflix series but to give a general sense of the size of the audience for Netflix's buzzy originals. The streaming giant does not disclose specific viewing figures for its shows, which goes against convention in the TV biz where ratings info for most networks is widely available.
“The notion that they are replacing broadcast TV may not be quite accurate,” he said.
Symphony also tracked data regarding the percentage of viewing that Netflix subscribers spent on selected Netflix series versus linear TV options, as an effort to show how viewing spikes around the delivery of new seasons.
In the first two weeks after “OITNB's” most recent season bowed in June, Netflix users spent 23%-25% of their TV watching time on the show. After that, the share of linear TV viewing for those viewers returned to the typical levels of 91%-97% of total viewing time. Wurtzel said Symphony data confirmed that “OITNB” ranks as Netflix's “biggest show by far.”
The share of viewing pattern was similar for “Narcos” and “Master of None” during each show's first week of availability on Netflix. “Narcos” had a 17% share of viewing in week one while “Master of None” grabbed 11% share of viewing, according to Symphony. The levels tapered off significantly after the first two weeks of availability.
Wurtzel said the volume and cyclical nature of Netflix viewing is important to consider amid the conventional wisdom that Netflix is grabbing market share from linear networks.
“I think we need a little bit of perspective when we talk about the impact of Netflix and SVOD (outlets),” Wurtzel said.
Wurtzel's presentation wasn't all about countering the Netflix effect. He ran through the network's efforts to get a more accurate picture of viewership across multiple platforms and the limitations of the current Nielsen system. He said there was “a glimmer of hope” on the horizon with a new Nielsen service that promises to do a better job of measuring non-linear platforms.
Among the intriguing stats Wurtzel shared:
Nielsen at present measures 1,231 TV channels. The average TV household receives 201 channels but only watches 16 regularly. In 2008, the average household received 129 channels and watched 17 regularly. That tells him that most viewers “engage in a manageable amount of viewing.” But for programmers, “the challenge is that everybody's menu (of favored channels) is very different.”
Time-shifting is the new majority. In 2008, 81% of TV viewing was done live. This season, live viewing has dropped to 51%. Another 26% of viewing is done within the first three days of a program's debut.
Viewers who watch shows late in the 35-day measurement cycle tend to be younger and richer. Using NBC's “Blindspot” as an example, Wurtzel noted that the median age for live plus 3 viewing was 52 with a median income of $74,000. In live plus 7, the median age was 46 while income was up “a tick.” Toward the end of the 35-day frame the median age was 43 and median income shot up to $91,000.
Digital availability has helped bring down the median age of the long-running “Law & Order: SVU,” which has a lower median age when digital viewing is factored in. The show at present has the best 18-24 demo ratings in its history.

Before Bain Capital, the Olympics and a bid to become president of the United States, Mitt Romney displayed exemplary business and leadership skills as an undergraduate at Brigham Young University.
The Cougar Club
Romney did not have a desire to be in student government when he first started at BYU in 1969. After seeing his father's unsuccessful presidential bid, and his mother's unsuccessful senate run, it just wasn't something he wanted to be involved in. However, after receiving encouragement from family, Romney got involved with the Cougar Club, the university booster club. Dane McBride, a former LDS missionary companion of Romney's and member of the Cougar Club in 1969, said that Romney eventually ran for president of the club, won, and made some big changes.
“When Romney took over the reigns of the Cougar Club (a service club with 30 to 50 members at the time), it was raising $10,000 to $12,000 a year,” McBride said. “Romney said the club should try and raise $100,000.”
When Romney suggested this, many of the members were perplexed.
“You could see people's faces blanch a little bit,” McBride said. “They said, ‘You can only do so many luaus a year, and sell so many mumus.'”
Romney had a different idea. He wanted to approach the administration at BYU to see if it was possible to get contact information for everyone that had been at BYU. He also wanted to set up phone banks, call everyone who had matriculated and ask for donations for the club. With the changes that Romney spearheaded, the Cougar Club reached its goal of raising $100,000 in one year.
McBride described this as being one of the highlights of his time in the Cougar Club. He remembered Romney told the members that this was something that when they were “old, 40 years old,” they would be able to remember that as a team, they accomplished something great that would have a long-lasting effect.
“That was one of the neat things about his leadership then and now. There was always a feeling that we were on a team with him,” McBride said. “He was the leader of the team, but he considered them his teammates. I recently visited behind the scenes with some of his leadership team, and it was obvious that they are a team. Mitt is just such a team builder. That's how he got things done in Massachusetts and in the Olympics. Students that weren't even members of the Cougar Club that made phone calls felt the team spirit too. It has been a part of his style for a long time.”
At a time in history when riots were common at other universities, Romney wanted something different to be said of BYU. He felt this would happen by rallying together students from across campus to raise the money.
“This is significant, especially for the period of time this took place,” McBride said. “At other universities, serious campus leaders did things like take over the president's office and ransack it, or blow up the ROTC building. This wasn't happening at BYU.”
Romney as a student
Romney didn't spend all his time studying and raising money. He was also married and enjoyed spending time with friends. During the summer, he and his friends would often go to Utah Lake to water ski.
“He is an exceptionally good water skier,” McBride said. “It wasn't his boat, but he was able to find one for us to go out on. He taught me how to water ski.”
Romney frequented BYU football and basketball games as well as the weekly campus devotionals. “He always really looked forward to hearing the brethren of the Church speak,” McBride said.
Many college students spend their summers selling door to door. Romney was no different. One summer he headed to Michigan to sell cordless microphones, along with McBride and a few others. They went with hopes of making enough money to support themselves through school. Things turned out differently.
“We fell short of our goals, though it wasn't because we weren't doing the right things,” McBride said. “The product wasn't very well made, so we weren't able to sell it very well.”
The men ended up making a few thousand dollars between them, a much smaller amount than what they anticipated. Luckily, being in Michigan, they were able to visit Romney's mother-in-law's house. She made sure they were well fed.
Living on love
Despite being the son of a wealthy governor, Mitt and Ann lived as most newlyweds in college did back then, McBride said.
“I never saw any ostentation or big spending by Ann and Mitt,” McBride said. “His father told him, ‘When you get married, you need to support your family.' He lived very modestly.”
McBride said that he lived in the same complex as the Romneys and moved into their apartment after they left BYU. For about $75 a month, the apartment had two rooms, a tiny kitchen and a small bathroom.
“They were in a semi-subterranean apartment because it was $10 less a month than the above-ground apartments,” McBride said. “It is probably what most married students would not choose to live in today. It had brown linoleum floors. A lot of the tiles were cracked. The kitchen had barely enough room for a small table to eat breakfast at.”
McBride reflected on how he and his wife often would have dinner with the Romneys. Instead of going out to eat, they would combine what they had in their pantries for a meal. If one of the couples had spaghetti noodles and tomatoes, and the others had hamburger and lettuce, they would eat a spaghetti dinner that night.
Even though Romney was busy being a husband, president of the Cougar Club and a student, he still spent time serving others. As a counselor in his congregation's bishopric, Romney was in charge of helping with the spiritual and temporal affairs of the members of that ward. For anyone, this would be a difficult task, but McBride said that Romney did a great job, even after the arrival of his firstborn son, Taggart, a year after he and Ann were married. Taggart slept in a crib at the foot of their bed because the apartment wasn't big enough for anything else.
Being young, married, and in college with a child is not an easy task. Romney didn't complain. In an interview with the Washington Post, Clayton F. Foulger, Romney's friend, said that Romney promoted married life.
“I remember Mitt explaining to me the benefits of married life,” Foulger said. “He didn't have to explain a lot. It was sort of self-evident, but he was appreciative of it.”
How others view Romney
Fellow Cougar Club member Tristan Pico recalls the first time he saw Romney.
“He had dark hair, of course. We all had hair back then. He still does; I do not. Mitt and Ann were together. I just remember being, one, impressed by how striking they were as a couple, and then, two, by how nice they were. They were very cordial when I first met them.”
Even after many years had passed, Pico was surprised that Romney recognized him at an event held in Beverly Hills and stated that Romney was the same person he had known in college.
“There were probably 100 people, and Mitt gave a speech in the back park at night,” Pico said. “He stood on the patio and spoke to this relatively small group of people. And afterwards, I went up and said to hello to him. I said, ‘Mitt, hi, I'm Tristan.' And he goes ‘Oh, I remember, from Cougar Club!' I mean, he was just so quick, it was amazing. And then I saw Ann, and I went over and talked to her, and my wife and I spent some time with her. It was a little bit like just stepping into the past because he was the same person, and he and Ann both acted in the same way.”
Pico said that the way Romney is often portrayed doesn't show an accurate picture of who he really is.
“It seems to be that he is being made out to be citizen plastic, and I think that sounds like a decision somebody made to characterize him as that,” Pico said. “Whenever I've heard him speak, he has been sincere and direct, but also cordial and accessible. So I think that characterization of him being anything but that is done more for political reasons than it is to describe him in reality.”
Romney's personality and leadership skills convinced many of those who knew him from the time he was at BYU to say that he could be president of the United States one day, although he may not have admitted it himself.
“I felt way back then that if … he did not become president of the United States, this country would be cheated,” McBride said. “I told others this, but never him because I knew he would not like such conversation. He had seen both his father and his mother trashed in political campaigns and was not interested in pursuing (politics).”
David Whetten, vice president of the Cougar Club when Romney was club president, described to The Universe how he and others saw Romney.
“Mitt seemed destined for greatness,” said Whetten. “I don't think anyone who knew Mitt back then is surprised by any of his achievements after he was at BYU.”
McBride said that Romney has always been a “hound for data and information,” that he works with others to learn about other viewpoints and that he has always been that way.
“He studies things out extremely well,” McBride said. “He absorbs it well. He develops ideas and teamwork and counsels. He has a high degree of respect for people. He respects ideas. He wants to hear every side of a disagreement. Developing ideas by counseling together is how he leads.”

The Kabul bombing brings to more than 30 the number of people who have been killed in a violent backlash over a YouTube trailer for the film, Innocence of Muslims, believed to have been produced by a small group of extremist Christians, which depicts the Prophet Mohammed as a thuggish womaniser.
Another potentially explosive publication is also due to hit newsstands in France today after the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo confirmed that its next edition contains several cartoons which feature caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.

The editor of the weekly, originally a cartoonist who uses the name Charb, said the images would "shock those who will want to be shocked".
In Afghanistan, Hezb-i-Islami, the second largest insurgent group after the Taliban who have been fighting US-led troops and the government for 10 years, claimed the attack and said it was to avenge the "insult" of the film.
"The bombing was in retaliation for the insult to our Prophet," spokesman Zubair Sidiqi told AFP in a telephone call from an undisclosed location.
Security officials said nine foreigners including South Africans were among those killed on a major highway leading to Kabul airport when the bomber blew up her station wagon alongside a minivan carrying foreign workers.
Taliban fighters last week stormed a British-run airfield, killing two US Marines and destroying six US fighter jets in another act of vengeance.
A week of angry violent protests outside US embassies and other American symbols in at least 20 countries have left some 19 people dead, including the American ambassador to Libya and three other US diplomats in Benghazi.
In Lebanon, the head of Shi'ite Muslim movement Hezbollah, which is blacklisted in the United States as a terrorist organisation, made a rare public appearance to warn of "very dangerous" repercussions if the entire film is released.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets of southern Beirut to denounce the film at the request of Hassan Nasrallah, who has called for a week of protests over the film, describing it as the "worst attack ever on Islam".
"The US must understand that releasing the entire film will have dangerous, very dangerous, repercussions around the world," he told the rally.
Al-Qa'ida's franchise in North Africa urged Muslims to storm US embassies and kill American envoys in Muslim countries to protest the film, monitoring group IntelCentre said.
The filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a 55-year-old Egyptian Copt and fraudster who was sentenced to 21 months in prison in the United States in June 2010, has not been seen since Saturday when he was questioned.
The risks now facing those involved in the production of the film were underlined when a Salafist cleric in Egypt called on Monday for the deaths of all those involved in its making.
Before dawn on Monday, officers from the Los Angeles County sheriff's department escorted four members of Mr Nakoula's family to join him in hiding.
Meanwhile Egypt's public prosecutor has ordered that seven US-based Egyptian Copts be tried over their role in the film, accusing them of "insulting the Islamic religion, insulting the Prophet (Mohammed) and inciting sectarian strife".
In Pakistan, two protesters died after demonstrating against the film in the northwest, close to the Afghan border, and outside the US consulate in Karachi.
Police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of more than 2,000 protesters trying to reach the US consulate in the city of Peshawar, chanting anti-US slogans and burning the Stars and Stripes flag.
In Indian Kashmir hundreds of Muslims clashed with security forces and burnt a police vehicle.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan blocked access to YouTube, following the video-sharing website's failure to take down the anti-Islam film. Saudi Arabia and Russia may also follow suit.
Google, which owns YouTube, has also barred access to the film in Egypt, India, Indonesia, Libya and Malaysia.
Violent demonstrations have spread this week after police on Friday battled to defend US missions from mobs in Egypt, Lebanon, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen.
In east Jerusalem hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli border police, hurling stones and firebombs at a checkpoint.
In Europe calls surfaced on Tuesday on social networks for Muslims in France to defy an official ban and hold fresh protests over the anti-Islam film.
The messages on Twitter and other sites called for demonstrations to be held Saturday in Paris, Marseille and other major cities, a week after police in the capital arrested 150 people for taking part in a rowdy protest near the US embassy.
The United States has deployed counter-terror Marine units to Libya to protect its embassy in Tripoli and stationed two destroyers off the North African coast.
A Calgary police officer facing aggravated assault charges for a violent arrest in 2015, is now facing a disciplinary hearing for another violent arrest in 2013.
Godfred Addai-Nyamekye filed a complaint against Const. Trevor Lindsay after he was arrested on December 28, 2013.
Addai-Nyamekye's complaint said Lindsay used excessive force during the arrest, used profanity, had no right to make the arrest and that Addai-Nyamekye was detained for a unreasonably long time after the arrest.
In a ruling from Calgary Police Chief Roger Chaffin dated July 3, all accusations beyond the use of force were dismissed.
The allegations have not been proven at this time.
Video footage of arrest
Video from a police helicopter shows Lindsay trying to pull a handcuffed Addai-Nyamekye to his feet from the snow-covered ground in downtown Calgary. Addai-Nyamekye falls back to the ground and the officer falls down on top of him.
Lindsay then delivers one or two punches to Addai-Nyamekye's head and proceeds to knee him repeatedly in the back and head before other officers arrive.
Prior to the arrival of the helicopter, Lindsay also deployed his Conducted Energy Weapon, commonly known as a Taser, twice. Addai-Nyamekye says Lindsay punched him in the face approximately five times and kicked him in the back and stomach.
"I have reviewed all of the evidence relating to this allegation and determined there is a reasonable prospect of establishing the facts necessary to prove officer misconduct," wrote Chaffin in his decision.
Previous violent arrest
Lindsay is also facing criminal charges in relation to an arrest in 2015, where he can be seen on video repeatedly punching Daniel Haworth in the head before throwing him head-first into the pavement outside the arrest processing unit of the Calgary police.

Haworth lost consciousness and was transported to Foothills Hospital, where he remained for about a week. His family says the effects of his injuries were lasting.
None of the allegations of assault against Haworth, who has since died from unrelated causes, have been proven in court.
Jury: Samsung Owes Apple Another $290 Million
A federal jury on Thursday ruled that Samsung owes Apple a further $290 million for infringing on the iPhone maker's patented technology, according to multiple reports from inside the courtroom.
The award concludes a partial retrial of last year's landmark case between the electronics giants. A jury in that case ruled in Apple's favor and awarded $1 billion in damages. However, Judge Lucy Koh ruled that more than $400 million of that award was improperly calculated, necessitating the current retrial.
Apple had argued it was due a further $379 million, while Samsung maintained it should only owe $52 million for the portion of damages being reconsidered. Barring a successful appeal, Samsung also owes roughly $600 million in damages from the original verdict as well.
The six-woman, two-man jury deliberated for part of three days before returning its verdict. During that time, the jury requested additional paper and pens and better lunch, as well as a copy of the sketches of them done by a courtroom artist.
This decision, though widely watched, does little to settle the litigation between the two companies, which spans multiple courtrooms and continents. Another case is set for trial next year before Judge Koh involving a newer generation of Samsung's products; meanwhile, both sides are appealing various parts of this current case.
Before dismissing the jury, Judge Koh is giving lawyers for both sides half an hour to review how the jury made its calculations in case any adjustments are needed.
Update: The jury has now been dismissed, with the total due Apple from the two cases adding up to $929.83 million. No word on how much both sides have racked up in legal bills.

With a lack of work in the oilfields of Alberta, Canadian companies big and small are increasingly looking to Mexico to get a stake in the billions of dollars being spent in the country's newly opened energy sector.
TransCanada and ATCO already have a presence in Mexico, with other companies like Suncor and SNC-Lavalin showing interest. On Monday, ATCO CEO Nancy Southern described the country as having "vast opportunities available."
There is definitely a desire. Mexico is shaping up very nice. - Mark Salkeld , Petroleum Services Association of Canada
Mexico is welcoming private investment after the state-owned company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has controlled every aspect of the oil and gas business for more than seven decades. Slowly, Mexico has begun inviting private companies to invest in everything from exploration, production, transportation, refining, storage and sales.
The timing is ideal considering the slowdown in Alberta's oilpatch.
"There is definitely a desire. Mexico is shaping up very nice," said Mark Salkeld, with the Petroleum Services Association of Canada. "You get into downturns like this and our member companies start looking international."
Canadian interest
Canadian energy companies have been involved in oil and gas production around the globe for decades. Salkeld himself has worked in Europe, Siberia and Australia during his career.
"You can find a Canadian in just about every oilpatch in the world, either on an individual basis or a company basis," he said.
Since oil prices began tumbling in 2014, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador, as corporate revenues nose-dived.
An oil worker looks up as the drill is pulled upward on the Centenario deepwater drilling platform off the coast of Veracruz in the Gulf of Mexico. (Associated Press) Canadian companies want to operate in countries where there is a level playing field. Mexico is much closer than most other foreign locations, as crews can drive down equipment from Canada.
In addition, Salkeld joked, "we have the technology to follow the geology under the Trump wall."
Mexico's Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said Monday in Calgary that the full implementation of the energy sector reform will take seven years, although some parts of the industry have already opened up to private companies.
Mexico's state-owned company has faltered in recent years with declining production and revenue, which led to the reforms. Pemex wasn't able to develop enough technology to unlock the country's reserves.
"We need to develop technologies for the new era of hydrocarbons," said Coldwell.
Creating all the new rules and regulations to unlock the energy sector has not been easy. Both the Alberta Energy Regulator and the University of Calgary are working with Mexican officials to transition to an open market.
"Disassembling that organizational structure as humanely as possible and architecturally designing a marketplace new system is a gargantuan task," said Harrie Vredenburg, with the U of C's Haskayne School of Business.
Billions worth of bids
Suncor is one of the 21 companies signed up to bid for some of Mexico's deepwater properties. Other firms include ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Murphy Oil. Mexico will accept bids in December and they are expected to generate billions of dollars.
In the last year, Vancouver-based Renaissance Oil won a bid for some small onshore properties from Pemex.
Mexican officials say they are meeting with SNC-Lavalin this week, as the company is said to have an interest in the country's transmission grid expansion.
TransCanada and ATCO are involved in natural gas pipelines in Mexico.
Canadian technology
Jose Antonio Gonzalez, director of Petroleos Mexicanos, speaks during a press conference in Mexico City in February 2016. Mexico's state-run oil company has announced a halt to some of its exploration and production projects, while foreign investors are being welcomed. (Associated Press) Mexico is trying to court international companies because the country lacks the technology desperately needed to boost oil and gas production. In particular, the country lacks expertise in fracking and deepwater drilling.
"[Canadian companies] have a lot of experience in unconventional resources. We have huge potential in that regard that we have not been able to exploit to the fullest," said Fernando Zendejas, head of Mexico's Department of Energy legal unit.
Currently there are no rules in place when it comes to fracking, but they are coming. Zendejas said they will strive to protect the environment but not be as prohibitive as some European countries.
"There are some guidelines already, but it is not formal regulation. That's what we have been working on," he said.
The Canada West Foundation, a Calgary-based think-tank, has cautioned that investing companies will face risks, including violence, crime and uncertainty about the new regulations.
Sleep/Standby. I really wish I knew how this worked. Because I have set my min and max speeds to 1000mhz and the phone still wakes up sluggish and shows a load average above 80. I could understand if I set the min and max to 125mhz but at 1000mhz the Droid should never fall behind.
Is 125Mhz bad? That is such a loaded question. A stock droid will actually clock down that low to help with battery life. The problem is with custom roms. If you only have a few programs running in background while the phone is in standby/sleep life is good. But if you are like me and you have 7 or 8 programs loaded at all time and it allows the CPU to fall behind on the work load. What is the side effect of this? Text messages and phone calls might be missed. The CPU is so busy trying to wake up and recover from the backed up work load that it actually misses the signal from the hardware that woke it up in the first place. I have put many hours in to testing this issue. At one point I got it down to only missing 1% of the incoming calls and texts with wonderful battery life. But I had to turn off a lot of apps to do it. The Droid simply wasn't as useful. So I now use 250Mhz as the low end to avoid missing calls and texts. But even at that speed I still notice the CPU getting bogged down during sleep mode. How do I notice it? When it wakes up to play a custom ringtone. If the work load is caught up, they play correctly. If the work load is way behind, it plays the default ringtone and sometimes I have to wait a second before I can slide the answer call button. One day I will find the magic bullet on this.
A candid photo of a man in the middle of a 10k run with a seemingly carefree smile has gone viral after he was given the moniker, "Ridiculously Photogenic Guy."
And as with any good meme, the photo has quickly spawned a number of altered versions of the original photograph, with users adding their own text, such as, "Goes For Run: Inadvertently Teaches World How To Spell "Ridiculously," and "Photobombs Wedding Picture: Nobody Minds." And maybe the best one yet, "Picture Gets Put Up As Employee Of The Month: For A Company That He Doesn't Work For."
The Post and Courier reports that the man in the photo is New York's Zeddie Little, 25, who was taking part in the Cooper River Bridge 10k run, which was held on March 31, in Charleston, South Carolina.
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) systems analyst Will King, who was just taking a seemingly random photograph of runners in the middle of the race, snapped the photo and uploaded it to his Flickr account.
"One of my friends commented on the picture and said something along the lines of 'I dub this guy Mr. Ridiculously Photogenic,'" King said. "I thought it was a pretty cool comment, so I posted it on Reddit. For some reason it just took off from there."
By Wednesday afternoon, the photo had received more than 1.25 million hits on Flickr alone, where King originally posted the image.
"Everybody was running and he was just smiling at the camera. He wasn't struggling or anything," Jessica Crouch, the friend who came up with the "Ridiculously Photogenic Guy" title, told the Post and Courier. "It's unusual. His hair was perfect and he had the perfect smile. It just struck me as being really out of place."
Though as handsome and composed as Little may be, let's be honest, he's got nothing on this guy, who has also been making the rounds on Reddit this week:

Now part of common parlance when referring to the overly-sensitive, easily-outraged, excessively-entitled Left, we read with particular enjoyment - for obvious reasons - that when London's Evening Standard asked Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk about the popularisation of the term, he responded "It does come from Fight Club. There is a line, ‘You are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.'”
For those who are inexplicably unfamiliar, in Fight Club Tyler Durden leads a generation of emasculated men to rediscover their inner strength by beating the hell out of each other. Two decades later, Palahniuk sees the modern generation as delicate flowers more than ever. “There is a kind of new Victorianism,” he said.
“Every generation gets offended by different things but my friends who teach in high school tell me that their students are very easily offended.”
Now snowflakes have blown across the Atlantic and entered into British parlance. Last week, Boris Johnson warned François Hollande not to administer “punishment beatings” in the Brexit negotiations. His old friend Michael Gove piled in, saying those offended were “deliberately obtuse snowflakes”. And the term has already been re-appropriated by its targets: at the Women's March in London on Saturday were signs with slogans such as “Damn right we're snowflakes: Winter is coming”.
Chuck says this is a problem with the Left, not the Right.
“The modern Left is always reacting to things,” he opined. “Once they get their show on the road culturally they will stop being so offended.” He added self-effacingly: “That's just my bulls**t opinion.”

The Maple Leafs were 12 points ahead of the Sens on March 15. Currently, the two teams are tied in points, which means that if the Sens were to win the game tonight, they would finish ahead of the Leafs in the standings. The Battle of Ontario is back!: "Look over there, David. A water bottle!" In order to get ready for the game tonight, Chris Phillips spent the day with some of the rookies on the team and took them through the origins of Battle of Ontario, which happened 14 years ago: "Please, Mr. Murray. Send us back to Binghamton already." Tonight's game may be the last home game as a Senator for Captain Jason Spezza. Is it a coincidence that it's against the Leafs? Yes, probably, but don't be surprised if you see this next season; Upon further examination, it is unlikely that Spezza gets traded to the Leafs this summer, as he is not from Mimico, Ontario. Also, we're very sorry for doing this. Tonight is the Leafs' final game of yet another successful season. Superstar David Clarkson had a great first year with the Leafs as he put up 5 goals and 6 assists in 59 games. Sens fans should consider themselves extremely unlucky that Bryan Murray didn't end up signing Clarkson to a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract. Although, I do wonder what it would look like in a world where Murray did end up signing Clarkson... Terrifying, isn't it? Enjoy the game tonight, and don't forget to donate
It's game day! The Sens are in Ottawa tonight to take on the hometown Leafs. Hold on, that can't be right. Ottawa is hoping to build off of their 2-1 shootout win against the Devils , and win their fourth game in a row.The stakes are raised for tonight's game, not because of the standings, but because it will be a #SensMotB game! If you're new here, Sens Money on the Board is a charity drive in which you pledge money for in-game events. For example, you can pledge $6.50 for a Karlsson assist, $16 for a MacArthur goal, $19.67 for a Sens win, or whatever your creative little mind can think of.Now on to the story lines:
Pointing fingers at Pakistan for the terror attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu on Sunday revealed that the government recently threw out few diplomats, who were working undercover in the Pakistan Embassy, as they were involved in armed networks.

Justifying his remark, Hasanul Haq said that the ISI did have connections with the Jamaat-e-Islami cadres in the past.
“And recently few diplomats, who were working undercover in the Pakistan Embassy, were thrown out of the country because they were involved in armed networks,” Hasanul Haq told reporters.
The Information Minister further said the Pakistan government and the ISI network are involved in covert relations with certain armed networks.

“They are openly supporting war criminals. So, politically they are with Jamaat-e-Islami, politically they are with the militants. So, that is a sad thing in the regional politics,” he added.
Hasanul Haq, however, said the identity of the accused and what do their connections have not yet been revealed.
Nine Italians, seven Japanese, one Indian, one Bangladeshi American and two Bangladeshis were among the 20 people killed in the terror attack at Holey Artisan Bakery in Gulshan on Friday night.

Meanwhile, security continues to be tight at all sensitive points in the capital with the police personnel checking all vehicles especially in the secured diplomatic area where the gruesome hostage killings took place.
Beef Stroganoff By Worker Bee
Once thought of as an impressive gourmet dish for dinner parties, Beef Stroganoff is actually easy enough to make any night of the week. It's essentially nothing more than thin strips of beef simmered in a creamy sauce. But what a delicious sauce it is, meaty and rich, and still guaranteed to impress.
There are several ways to make the creamy sauce, depending on how your body feels about dairy and how you feel about the flavor of coconut milk. This recipe combines 1/2 cup (125 ml) coconut milk with 1 cup (250 ml) whole cream for a decadent-tasting sauce with light coconut flavor. The whole cream can be omitted and 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of coconut milk can be used instead. You could even omit both the coconut milk and cream and simply serve the meat and simmered stock with a dollop of sour cream. The dish will turn out great no matter what.
Beef Stroganoff was first made in Russia centuries ago. Way back then, stroganoff was served without a carb companion, unless some fried potatoes could be found. Rice and noodles were not part of the original dish so there's no reason to add them now. The tender beef and mushrooms and flavorful sauce are hearty enough and so delicious that you won't want a noodle to get in the way.
Serves: 4
Time in the Kitchen: 35 minutes
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon coconut oil (15 ml)
1 1/2 pounds (680 g) beef tenderloin or sirloin, cut into 1/4-inch thick slices (6 mm) that are 2 to 3 inches in length (5 cm to 7.6 cm)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter (30 m)
1/4 cup finely chopped shallots (60 ml)
8 ounces cremini or white mushrooms, thinly sliced (230 g)
1 cup beef stock (250 ml)
1/2 cup coconut milk (125 ml)
1 cup heavy cream (250 ml)
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (15 ml)
Chopped fresh parsley or dill for an optional garnish
Instructions:
Lightly season the beef with salt and pepper. Heat the coconut oil in a large skillet (12-inch or more) over high heat until the skillet is very hot. Add half of the beef strips, cooking for 1 minute on each side to brown. Put the cooked meat in a bowl. Let the pan heat up again before browning the rest of the meat. Add the second batch of meat to the bowl.
Turn the heat down slightly to medium-high. Add the butter. When it melts, add the shallots. Sauté for just a minute or two then add the mushrooms. Cook the mushrooms until soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Add the beef stock and coconut milk, scraping the bottom of the skillet to release all the tasty bits stuck to the pan. Boil for 5 minutes.
Whisk in the heavy cream and mustard. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes to thicken the sauce slightly.
Add the meat and any juice that's collected in the bowl with the meat. Simmer just a few minutes to heat the meat back up.
Add sea salt to taste and serve. Add chopped parsley or dill for garnish if desired.

In response to the news that France's richest man has applied for Belgian nationality, the country's leading left-wing daily has declared: "get lost, you rich bastard!"*
The forthright headline, emblazoned across today's front page of Libération, is aimed at Bernard Arnault, CEO of the luxury fashion conglomerate LMVH. Arnault applied for Belgian nationality after the socialist president François Hollande proposed a new 75 per cent tax rate on earnings over one million euros. He denies he is trying to avoid tax, but Libération nonetheless condemns his decision as "a symbol of the arrogance of the wealthiest".
The headline is actually a play on a famous gaffe made by the former president, Nicholas Sarkozy, who muttered "casse-toi, pov' con" ("get lost, you poor bastard") at a member of the public who refused to shake his hand. The phrase subsequently became a taunt taken up by Sarkozy's left-wing opponents.
UPDATE: Arnault is now suing Libération, according to a press release from his company. Arnault, "has no other choice, given the extreme vulgarity and violence of the headline," it says.
To further illustrate why I don't think Drew Brees' arm strength is the reason for the New Orleans Saints' struggles to get the ball downfield, I broke down some numbers from ESPN Stats & Information.
Bree has completed just 1 of 4 passes this season that traveled 38 yards or more in the air (including his underthrown interception to Robert Meachem last week, but also including a gorgeous 46-yard pass to Kenny Stills a week earlier).
That's not great, but it's not unusual. The entire NFL has completed a total of 29 such passes this season out of 93 attempts (31.2 percent).
In 2011, when Brees had one of the greatest passing seasons in NFL history, he completed 3 of 9 throws that traveled 38 yards or more in the air. In 2009, when they won a Super Bowl, he was 4 of 15.
It's not a good way to measure arm strength, since such throws are simply difficult to pull off in the NFL. The Philadelphia Eagles' Nick Foles, for instance, is 1 of 12 on such throws this season. Only four quarterbacks have completed more than two of them this season (Kirk Cousins 4-of-7, Matthew Stafford 4-of-8, Tony Romo 3-of-6 and Brian Hoyer 3-of-7).
The bigger issue, as I wrote earlier Tuesday in my “Film Don't Lie" breakdown of the Saints' downfield passing game, is that the Saints have been unable to get the ball downfield consistently to their wide receivers from all distances.
And there are a number of reasons for it -- including Brees' lack of timing or placement on some of those downfield throws. He admitted he needs to get a better feel for those throws again. I just don't believe it's simply a matter of arm strength with Brees, who still has shown plenty of his usual zip on intermediate throws.
Two sisters from the Gaza Strip were arrested Wednesday after they were caught smuggling explosives for Hamas in medical supplies, the Shin Bet security service said.
The women were caught at the Erez crossing when they left to Gaza after one of them had received treatment in Israel for cancer. The two were taken in for questioning and the explosives, which were hidden in tubes, were dealt with by a police expert in bomb disposal.
A preliminary investigation found that Hamas was behind the attempt and the explosives were intended for terrorist attacks in Israel, the Shin Bet said in a statement.
“This is a continuation of the attempts by terrorist organizations in Gaza, mainly Hamas, to abuse the humanitarian channel and the medical aid Israel provides to Gaza residents to carry out terrorist attacks in Israel,” the Shin Bet said.
This is it. This is Delvin Rodriguez's chance to leave an impression, not to mention garner a good pay-day, at an age (Delvin is 33) when those chances will begin to diminish or vanish altogether.
With Rodriguez being only 5-4-2 in his last 11 fights and 0-2 record in his championship fights (2009 to Hlatshwayo, 2012 to Trout) this very well could be his last hurrah. The final arc of his career could be very pleasant and fairly lucrative if he can manage the biggest victory of his career (by far) against Cotto.
Winning his last two fights in dominant KO fashion has catapulted Rodriguez into a dream scenario.
Rodriguez acknowledged as much saying, “It's gonna be a tough fight for Cotto. Once I get in with my jab and right hand he will cut. There's no doubt in my mind that I will cut him open. I'm going to go for the knockout. I will take advantage of the biggest opportunity of my life.”
Rodriguez is trending up, while his opponent Miguel Cotto is trending down.
Cotto last fought in December 2012 against Austin Trout and was thoroughly outworked in losing a decision (a lopsided one on two scorecards). Before that Cotto lost both of his 154 lbs titles to Floyd Mayweather in May 2012.
With Cotto saying he wants to fight three more times before hanging up the gloves he needs to not just win, but look great doing it if he wants to put himself in position to put an exclamation mark on the end of his HOF career.
The fight is a match up of fighters at a crossroads in their careers. For no other reason I can see that being enough for both fighters to bring it in a way that they might not have before.
One man is seeing his greatest opportunity presented before him on a silver platter. The other knows the end is coming, but wants to leave a lasting impression on boxing fans before he eventually calls it a career.
Miguel Cotto (37-4, 30 KOs) vs. Delvin Rodriguez (28-6-3, 16 KOs) happens on October 5 in Orlando. The bout will be televised on HBO.
Disney did the impossible: destroyed the Muppets. By making the Muppets “edgy” left-wing partisans who attack Fox News, come out as pro-abortion, and hurl sex jokes, the once-universally beloved franchise has been doomed. First, the leftwing Muppets failed at the box office, and now Kermit and Company are on the verge of having their new television show cancelled.
The new series premiered less than a month ago. Initially, at least for the premiere, and no doubt riding on the goodwill of a beloved past, the ratings were good. After one look at the new show, the ratings took a steep nosedive. In week three, the ratings crashed again.
What was once funny, zany, inclusive, nonpartisan, brilliant, innocent, and irreverent while still being sincere, has been destroyed by Disney. Our toys came to life and they were awesome. Now they're pro-abortion, Fox News haters living (on this new show) in the real world with real-life relationship problems.
This new Muppet show is a based on a mockumentary premise like “the Office,” only it is behind the scenes at Miss Piggy's late-night talk show. Kermit and Miss Piggy are broken up and… It's too depressing to go on.
Whoever these freaks are that Disney invented, they are not our lovable Muppets.
More proof the old saying is true: Liberals ruin everything.

Washington, April 13 (IANS) International whistleblower organisation Wikileaks has accused former US first lady and secretary of state Hillary Clinton of stealing its "innovative" Twitter logo design for her 2016 presidential campaign.
The Julian Assange-led organisation tweeted on Sunday accusing Clinton of stealing their insignia for her logo, the Daily Mail reported on Monday.
"Hillary Clinton has stolen our innovative WikiLeaks twitter logo design," read a WikiLeaks Twitter post.
The WikiLeaks tweet compared its logo with that used in Clinton's campaign, by placing them side-by-side.
The WikiLeaks logo features an hourglass with one "globe" dripping into another with a red arrow next to it. Clinton's logo, on the other hand, shows a red arrow with a large blue "H" around it.
Clinton is not, however, the first politician to be criticised for their logo choices this year.
Earlier this year, US Senator Rand Paul was accused of swiping Tinder's flame for his Rand Paul Political Action Committee logo. Both logos feature a flame above the typography.
Clinton's presidential announcement caused a wave of criticism on Twitter, in which several people used the hashtag, #WhyImNotVotingForHillary.
While launching her presidential campaign on Sunday, Clinton leaned on the message of middle-class rescue and claimed that the US economy was "still stacked in favour of those at the top", according to a campaign video.
"I'm getting ready to do something," Clinton said, following a series of clips of ordinary-looking Americans describing what they were "getting ready for".
"I'm running for president," she said. "Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion."
Clinton, 67, became the third major figure to announce her US presidential aspirations.
Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul rolled out their campaigns earlier.

The resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn did little to calm the chaos at the White House, where staff spent Tuesday scrambling to deflect blame for the rising scandal about Flynn's contacts with Russian officials — including who knew what about the conversations and when.
Other ongoing controversies intruded on the White House's ability to impose its own narrative on the Flynn situation, adding to the sense of confusion in President Donald Trump's Washington.
Story Continued Below
Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub released a letter recommending that the White House investigate Kellyanne Conway and consider disciplinary action against her for encouraging the public to buy clothes from the line marketed by Ivanka Trump, the president's oldest daughter, after Nordstrom stopped carrying it.
Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have been hesitant to chastise the new administration, also began asserting some distance from the president. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, sent a request to the White House on Tuesday for answers about security protocols at Mar-a-Lago and details about potentially sensitive documents after club members photographed the president and senior staff reading on the club's dining terrace Saturday.
And Senate Republicans called for investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election on Trump's behalf. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) left the door open to supporting an independent investigative commission, while Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) appeared to support the idea of requiring Flynn to testify before committee investigations. “What I'd like to know is, did Gen. Flynn make this phone call by himself? If he was directed, by whom?” Graham asked. “Did they try to engage the Russians before they were in office? Was this part of a continuing pattern between the Trump people and Russia?”
White House staff seemed disorganized in their response to the crises.
For the second time in less than a day, White House press secretary Sean Spicer contradicted statements from others in the White House. He told reporters at Tuesday's daily press briefing that Trump demanded Flynn's resignation, whereas senior administration officials said Monday night that Flynn decided to step down on his own.
Spicer also said that Trump had been aware of and was reviewing Flynn's actions “for several weeks” after having been briefed by White House counsel Don McGahn. The president told reporters aboard Air Force One last Friday that he “didn't know about” a Washington Post report in which Flynn acknowledged he'd discussed sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on a December call with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — and that he'd misled Vice President Mike Pence, who publicly said Flynn hadn't brought up sanctions on the calls.
On Tuesday evening, a staffer for Pence confirmed that the vice president had been kept in the dark for weeks about the truth of Flynn's conversation — only learning about it from the Feb. 9 Post story — although Trump himself had been briefed about Flynn's call on Jan. 26.
The press secretary said the president demanded Flynn's resignation because he'd lost trust in his national security adviser, not because of concerns about the legality of Flynn's actions or their impact on national security.
The resignation came shortly after a second Post report about Justice Department officials briefing McGahn on their concerns surrounding Flynn. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Flynn was interviewed days after Trump's inauguration by FBI agents investigating his conversations with Kislyak.
“The question wasn't, ‘Did he do something illegal?'” Spicer said. “It was, ‘Could he be trusted further?”
Flynn, a retired three-star lieutenant general who was among Trump's earliest supporters in the national security establishment, had long been the target of suspicion by Democrats and Trump opponents. He traveled with Trump to Florida over the weekend, joining the president as he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe—and advised the two leaders on Saturday, when they interrupted their golf weekend to address North Korea's launch of a test missile.
White House aides sent conflicting messages Monday about Flynn's fate. In an afternoon appearance, Conway asserted in an interview with MSNBC that Flynn still "enjoys the full confidence of the president.” Less than an hour later, Spicer issued a formal statement informing the media that Trump was "evaluating" the Flynn situation. Ultimately, it was chief strategist Steve Bannon, Flynn's only remaining defender and closest confidant in the White House, who delivered the news in the residence Monday evening that Trump needed him to step down.
On Tuesday morning, following Flynn's late night resignation, Conway went on television again to spin the developments, stating that "in the end it was [Flynn] misleading the vice president that made the situation unsustainable.” She was then asked why action wasn't taken sooner given that McGahn had been briefed weeks ago by acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was dismissed by Trump after she refused to defend his Jan. 27 order blocking citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S.
At Tuesday's briefing, Spicer said McGahn had briefed the president about Yates' concerns, though he declined to say exactly what the president had been told. A White House aide said earlier in the day that the president had not been completely briefed, and that McGahn and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus were in “hot water” for it.
Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday evening that he thought Priebus was doing a “great job.”
The disarray in the White House comes as Trump is facing serious national security challenges, including Russia's ongoing incursions into Ukraine and North Korea's nuclear missile test.
Some speculated that, with Flynn out of the picture, Defense Secretary James Mattis might begin to take a bigger role in the administration. Mattis was inside the White House residence Monday night along with Bannon, Priebus and Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, when Flynn resigned, and is involved with choosing Flynn's successor.
Vice Adm. Robert Harward, a former Mattis deputy, is the early favorite for the job, according to several White House sources. National Security Council chief of staff Keith Kellogg has been named acting national security adviser until the post is filled.
On Capitol Hill, Republican senators remain confused about who has authority within the White House. “We don't know who is in charge,” Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has privately expressed frustration at not knowing whether to contact Kushner or Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss the administration's Middle East policy, according to a source familiar with his thinking. (Cruz, through a spokesman, called the source's statement untrue.)
"I can't figure out what's going on over there," said a foreign policy staffer in the office of another GOP senator. "I've never seen anything like this. We don't know who the point person is on national security issues. On anything, really."

Saving China's stock market
Yi Huang, Jianjun Miao, Pengfei Wang
The Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped by a third in mid-2015, wiping out billions in share value. One of the responses of the Chinese government was to directly participate in the stock market. This column assesses the costs and benefits of this intervention, finding that the resulting gains amounted to about 5% of Chinese GDP. The value was created not just from increased equity and investor confidence, but also from increased liquidity and reduced probability of default for listed firms.
From mid-June to early July of 2015, the Chinese Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSECI) plunged by 32%, wiping out more than RMB 18 trillion in share value from its 12th June peak. The value lost was equivalent to about 30% of China's GDP in 2014 and about 20% of US GDP in 2014. Figure 1 presents the SSECI index and some major events that happened during the period from 1st July 1 2014 to 30th September 2015.
Figure 1. A chronology of China's stock market
The large stock market crash produced widespread panic and pushed the Chinese government to implement a range of rescue policies. Did the government intervention create value, or was it simply a redistribution of value from taxpayers to the rescued firms? If it created value, where did the value add come from?
These questions are important for policymakers and investors, but have not been studied in the literature. Veronesi and Zingales (2012) provide an estimate of the costs and benefits of the Paulson plan implemented during the US financial crisis in 2008. In a recent paper, we provide a similar analysis for China (Huang et al. 2016).
Unlike the Paulson plan, the Chinese government directly participated in stock market trading by purchasing about half of the stocks listed in the Chinese stock market. The trading was done through two state-owned corporations, China Securities Finance Corporation Limited (CSF) and China Central Huijin Investment Limited (CCH), which are known as the ‘national team'. Other institutions such as brokerages and mutual funds also participated in the intervention. Our analysis focuses on the national team due to data availability.
Methodology
The national team continually purchased stocks starting in July 2015, but we do not observe its daily trading behaviour. We can only observe its share holdings of the rescued firms from their quarterly balance sheets. From the balance sheets in the second and third quarters of 2015, we can infer the net purchases by the government in that period. We thus provide a short-run estimate of the costs and benefits of the government's purchases during the period 30th June to 30th September 2015.
Given the global turbulence in financial markets during the period, it is impossible to estimate the systemic effects of the government intervention. However, it is possible to estimate its effects on the rescued firms. To compute these effects on the value of the rescued firms, we do not limit ourselves to the changes in the value of common stocks, but we study the changes in the entire enterprise value by also studying changes in the value of existing debt.
We first compute the actual cost of the stock purchases as the difference between the purchase cost and the holding value on 30th September 2015. The purchase cost is estimated to be the purchase prices multiplied by the number of shares purchased between 1st July and 30th September. Since we do not observe the national team's daily trading information, we consider three estimates of the purchase prices: the lowest, the highest, and the average market prices between the two dates.
Second, we compute the change in equity value using the capital asset pricing model of Sharpe (1964). We compute the abnormal returns between 1st July and 30th September of common stocks after correcting for market events. Then the change of a stock value is equal to the stock's market capitalisation on 30th June, multiplied by the stock's abnormal returns.
Third, we compute the change in debt value using the model of Merton (1974). We use the observable equity value, the estimated equity volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and debt maturity to compute firm value and default probabilities on 30th June and 30th September 2015. We compute debt value as the difference between firm value and equity value. Since debt value also changed for non-rescued firms, we then correct the market events to compute the (adjusted) change in debt value of recued firms using non-rescued firms in the same industry as a control.
Finally, we compute the costs/benefits of the government intervention as the sum of the changes in the equity value and debt value minus the actual cost of the stock purchase.
Benefits and costs of the government purchases
We find that the total costs of stock purchases by the national team range from RMB 770.5 billion to 1,708.8 billion. Subtracting the market value on 30th September, we find that the total actual costs of stock purchases are RMB 321.9 (average price), 818.6 (the highest price), and -119.8 (the lowest price). The change in equity value of all rescued firms is RMB 113 billion. The change in debt value of all rescued firms is RMB 3,169 billion. Using these values, we find that the total net gains of all purchased stocks are between RMB 2,464 and 3,402 billion. These gains are about 5% of Chinese GDP in 2014.
Sources of value creation
Where does the value creation come from? Since the national team purchased more than 1,000 stocks, we have a relatively large sample to conduct a cross-sectional regression analysis. We find the following results.
First, the government purchase increased the demand for shares and raised equity value (or reduced the loss of equity value), thereby raising investors' confidence.
Second, the government purchase reduced default probabilities of the rescued firms and hence their debt value.
Third, the government purchase raised liquidity of the rescued firms.
Final thoughts
We should emphasise that our estimates are based on a short-run analysis. Many researchers are concerned about the long-run costs of the Chinese government intervention. First, the massive stock purchases by the government prevented the efficient discovery of stock prices. The national team is a large player in the stock market, whose transactions can have a large impact on price movements. As a result, the stock prices may not reflect fundamentals. This may plant the seeds of a future bubble. Second, the Chinese government intervention can create a moral hazard problem. If firms believe that the government will rescue them if they default on the margin loans, then they may keep borrowing more without improving the loans' profitability. Third, in addition to directly purchasing stocks, the government took some other measures such as halting IPOs, restricting short selling, and imposing a lock-up rule. These measures prevented the normal function of the stock market. Besides these possible long-run costs, there are many other questions worth further studying. For example, what are the problems of the Chinese trading system? How should one reform this system? Is there a better alternative intervention approach? We leave these questions for future research.

Actors walk the red carpet at Russia's annual TEFI awards ceremony in Moscow, October 3, 2017 Mladen Antonov / AFP / Scanpix / LETA
The Russian Academy of Television announced the winners of its “TEFI” awards this Tuesday, October 3, in a ceremony that resembles the Emmys in the United States. Unlike the Emmys, where winners get statuettes depicting a winged woman holding an atom, taking home a TEFI means pocketing a certificate and a statuette showing Greek mythology's Orpheus kneeling and tearing at his chest in agony. That sentiment captured a lot of people's feelings when they heard about this year's TEFI winners — especially the trophy for “best educational program” that went to Igor Prokopenko, who hosts a TV show that just last week spent 45 minutes exploring the “Flat-Earth Theory.” Writing for the website The Insider, Anna Krasnoperova pointed out that the TEFI winners for “best evening news program” and “best analytical review program” also have a lot to answer for. Meduza summarizes Krasnoperova's report here.
If you don't watch Russian television, perhaps you've never heard of Pervyi Kanal's evening news broadcast “Vremya” or Rossiya-1's weekend review show “Vesti Nedeli,” but they're two of the most watched and influential news programs in the country. This year, the Russian Academy of Sciences awarded TEFIs to both these largely pro-government TV shows, which air on state-owned networks. As a kind of retrospective, Anna Krasnoperova at The Insider reviewed five of the most notorious fake stories these programs reported in recent years.
1: Alexey Navalny works for the CIA
In April 2016, Dmitry Kiselyov's “Vesti Nedeli” show aired a report accusing oppositionist and anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny of cooperating with British and American intelligence agencies. The report was littered with oddities that raise serious questions about its credibility: supposed intelligence agents wrote in poor, bizarre English; an audiotape didn't match Navalny's real voice; and, on two occasions, Navalny apparently time traveled, based on the timestamps found on “secret correspondence.”

The report also featured comments by three notoriously unreliable figures: Pavel Karpov, the police investigator who opened the criminal case that was ultimately used to arrest Sergey Magnitsky; Oleg Lurye, a journalist previously imprisoned for blackmailing the wife of a senator; and Alexander Mercouris, a disgraced, disbarred British lawyer who frequently appears in pro-Kremlin media, sometimes identified as a “Greek political analyst” or an “international affairs expert.”
2: The “rape” of Little Lisa
On January 11, 2016, Pervyi Kanal reported a fake story that would later be used in case studies of “Russian disinformation.” When a 13-year-old Russian-German girl named Lisa F. reappeared in Berlin after going missing for three days, she initially claimed that she'd been kidnapped and raped by three Arab migrants. Further investigation debunked this story, however, and Lisa later admitted that she went hiding voluntarily and wasn't raped.
Even after police refuted the rumors about Lisa's case, Pervyi Kanal continued airing news segments about her supposed rape. Apparently reacting to the coverage on Russian television, some Russian Germans even staged demonstrations in several parts of Germany to protest what Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov called the German authorities' tendency “to paint over reality in a politically correct manner for domestic reasons.”
A magazine run by NATO later called the Russian media's coverage of the “Lisa case” a “wake-up call for German political elites.”
3: Germany's Syrian refugee welfare king
Pervyi Kanal was one of many media outlets to report the fake story of a Syrian refugee named “Ghazia A.” living in Germany with his four wives and 23 kids, supposedly pulling down almost half a million bucks in welfare checks. In this same news report, Pervyi Kanal also recycled phony claims (later deleted from its website) that Austria's Supreme Court acquitted an Iraqi refugee for raping a 10-year-old boy. (In fact, the man was sentenced to several years in prison.)
The report about Ghazia A., which first appeared in the German newspaper Rhein-Zeitung, was based on mostly false information. No German government official ever verified that a Syrian refugee was collecting so much money in benefits, and the “360,000 euros” figure actually comes from a financial expert named Hubert Königsstein, who merely speculated that a man in Ghazia A.'s situation could claim such benefits.
A municipality spokesperson told the German news service Deutsche Welle, however, that this isn't how benefits work in Germany, where polygamy is prohibited, meaning that the Syrian refugee would have had to select one wife and claim her respective children for any social assistance.
At the end of the segment, Pervyi Kanal's reporter even intentionally mispronounced Ghazia A.'s name to make a joke.
4: Refugees terrorize the Swedish city of Malmö
On February 19, Pervyi Kanal aired a report from Malmö, describing Sweden's third biggest city as a “remote corner” of the country transformed into a dystopian hellhole by a “criminal wave” of Arab migrants. The report claimed incorrectly that Muslim immigrants make up 43 percent of the city's population (in fact, only 32 percent of the city's residents were born abroad, and far from all of them are Muslim).
Pervyi Kanal also presented Fridhem, a neighborhood in Malmö, as a particularly dangerous area, though local sources told The Insider that it's actually a generally peaceful place. According to the crowd-sourced global database Numbeo, Malmö's overall level of crime is “moderate,” scoring it significantly higher than American metropolises like Baltimore and Chicago.

As it happens, a day before Pervyi Kanal's report on Malmö, U.S. President Donald Trump made headlines by alluding to a nonexistent terrorist attack in Sweden. “Sweden, who would believe this?” Trump asked a crowd of supporters in Florida.

The president later explained that he was referring to a segment aired on Fox News, where filmmaker Ami Horowitz claimed that migrants in Sweden are responsible for a new crime wave. Two Swedish police officers interviewed in Horowitz's documentary later told reporters that their comments were edited selectively and taken out of context.
5: Creative dubbing in France
On May 15, “Vesti Nedeli” aired a segment about “the political situation in Europe,” focusing on the “growing Euroskeptic movement in France.” The show's correspondent interviewed several activists who demonstrated against a new labor law, but the Russian dubbing completely changed their comments, rewriting what they said from start to finish as a rant against immigrants.
Needless to say, French television ridiculed the news report, and even tracked down the protesters interviewed by “Vesti Nedeli,” who were horrified to learn how their comments had been mistranslated for Russian viewers.

T-Mobile, a couple years ago, probably had one of the worst networks in the US. But with the whole Uncarrier revolution the team has been working hard to improve the network, acquire new spectrum and build the fastest LTE network in the country, and that's according to Ookla (who uses crowdsourced data from people like you and me). T-Mobile's Chief Technology Officer, Neville Ray, has just posted his year-end highlights on the network as well as a look ahead for the magenta network.
In 2015 alone, Ray states that the T-Mobile network added coverage to 1-million square miles, which is equivalent to one third of the continental US. That means LTE was brought to 219 new markets for the first time. That alone is a pretty big step for T-Mobile. Neville Ray also pointed out that this year, the network saw peak data speeds of 150Mbps. Additionally, about 40% of calls were made on VoLTE, which T-Mobile claims is the most advanced voice experience you'll find. Finally, with their Extended Range LTE (using band 12), they've used carrier aggregation to combine mid-band spectrum along with low-band spectrum to make for a pretty spectacular network.
Now looking into the Future, Ray states that they will continue to roll out advanced network technologies that will benefit their customers. Some of that includes extending T-Mobile LTE into new suburbs, towns and other destinations. As well as building more speed and capacity (because as T-Mobile adds more and more customers, they are going to need more capacity to handle those customers), as well as rolling out 4x4 MIMO and 3-band carrier aggregation. Neville Ray also states that they will participate "aggressively in the upcoming broadcast spectrum auction" as many other T-Mobile execs have been saying all along. The team is also looking to drive more innovation to LTE-Unlicensed.
We've heard some talk of 5G from Verizon, and T-Mobile says that when 5G is ready, they will be delivering it to their customers. Ray reiterated that industry standards for 5G are not yet established, so it's still in its infancy. T-Mobile is also planning to keep the focus on bringing an ever-evolving network experience to their customers today and in the future.
The future looks pretty bright for T-Mobile and its network. It'll be interesting to see how much it improves in 2016. In 2015, it improved greatly, especially in the suburbs and smaller towns.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel (C) talks to U.S President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump as they arrive to attend a performance by the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra in the ancient Greek theatre as part of the G7 Summit in Taormina, Sicily, Italy, May 26, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel believes firmly in strong German - U.S. relations and is simply being honest with the United States when she flags up policy differences with Washington, her spokesman said on Monday.
Merkel sent shockwaves through Washington and London by saying on Sunday that Europe must take its fate into its own hands, implying that the United States under President Donald Trump and Britain after its Brexit vote were no longer reliable partners.
She made the comments after Trump criticised major NATO allies over their military spending and refused to endorse a global climate change accord at back-to-back summits last week.
"The chancellor's words stand on their own - they were clear and comprehensible," her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told a regular government news conference in Berlin on Monday, adding: "It was a deeply convinced trans-Atlanticist who spoke."
After the meetings of NATO and the G7 group of wealthy nations, Merkel told a packed beer tent in Munich that the days when Europe could completely rely on others were "over to a certain extent".
"I have experienced this in the last few days," she said. "And that is why I can only say that we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands - of course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbours wherever that is possible also with other countries, even with Russia."
Merkel's remarks, made to her Christian Democrat party's Bavarian allies, were particularly striking as the chancellor, a fan of the United States as a teenager in Communist East Germany, has always been known as a resolute Atlanticist.
Seibert stressed that this remained the case.
"Those of you who have reported on the chancellor for a long time will know how important German-American relations are to her," he told the news conference.
"They are a firm pillar of our foreign and security policy, and Germany will continue to work to strengthen these relations," he said, adding that Merkel had said before that Europe must take its fate into its own hands.
"Because trans-Atlantic relations are so important to this chancellor, it is right from her viewpoint to speak out honestly about differences," Seibert said.
In Vienna, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny was asked whether difficult political relations between Europe and the United States were causing any downside risk for the world economy. He replied: "No. I have to say, this is an advantage that central banks have relative to the governments..."
Nowotny described ECB cooperation with the U.S. Federal Reserve as "very good, very intensive."
"Fortunately central banks are independent and not dependent on the short-term political discussions," he said.

We have yet to discover any signs of an extraterrestrial civilization — a prospect that could quite literally change overnight. Should that happen, our sense of ourselves and our place in the cosmos would forever be shaken. It could even change the course of human history. Or would it?
Top image: Josh Kao; more about this artist here.
Last week, SETI's Seth Shostak made the claim that we'll detect an alien civilization by 2040. Personally, I don't believe this will happen (for reasons I can elucidate in a future post — but the Fermi Paradox is definitely a factor, as is the problem of receiving coherent radio signals across stellar distances). But it got me wondering: What, if anything, would change in the trajectory of a civilization's development if it had definitive proof that intelligent extraterrestrials (ETIs) were real?

Finding a World Much Like Our Own
As I thought about this, I assumed a scenario with three basic elements.
First, that humanity would make this historic discovery within the next several years or so. Second, that we wouldn't actually make contact with the other civilization (just the receipt, say, of a radio transmission — something like a Lucy Signal that would cue us to their existence). And third, that the ETI in question would be at roughly the same level of technological development as our own (so they're not too much more advanced than we are; that said, if the signal came from an extreme distance, like hundreds or thousands of light-years away, these aliens would probably have advanced appreciably by now. Or they could be gone altogether, the victims of a self-inflicted disaster).

I tossed this question over to my friend and colleague Milan Cirkovic. He's a Senior Research Associate at the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade and a leading expert on SETI.
"Well, that's a very practical question, isn't it?" he responded. "Because people have been expecting something like this since 1960 when SETI was first launched — they haven't really been expecting to find billion-year old supercivilizations or just some stupid bacteria."
Advertisement
Indeed, the underlying philosophy of SETI over the course of its 50-year history has been that we'll likely detect a civilization roughly equal to our own — for better or worse. And no doubt, in retrospect it started to look "for worse" when the hopes of an early success were dashed. Frank Drake and his colleagues thought they would find signs of ETIs fairly quickly, but that turned out not to be the case (though Drake's echo can still be heard in the unwarranted contact optimism of Seth Shostak).
"Enormous Implications"
"Some people argued that a simple signal wouldn't mean much for humanity," added Cirkovic, "but I think Carl Sagan, as usual, had a good response to this."

Specifically, Sagan said that the very understanding that we are not unique in the universe would have enormous implications for all those fields in which anthropocentrism reigns supreme.
"Which means, I guess, half of all the sciences and about 99% of the other, non-scientific discourse," said Cirkovic.
Sagan also believed that the detection of a signal would reignite enthusiasm for space in general, both in terms of research and eventually the colonization of space.

"The latter point was quite prescient, actually, because at the time he said this there wasn't much enthusiasm about it and it was much less visible and obvious than it is today," he added.
No doubt — this would likely generate tremendous excitement and enthusiasm for space exploration. In addition to expanding ourselves into space, there would be added impetus to reach out and meet them.
At the same time, however, some here on Earth might counterargue that we should stay home and hide from potentially dangerous civilizations (ah, but what if everybody did this?). Ironically, some might even argue that we should significantly ramp up our space and military technologies to meet potential alien threats.

Developmental Trajectories
In response to my query about the detection of ETIs affecting the developmental trajectory of civilizations, Cirkovic replied that both of Sagan's points can be generalized to any civilization at their early stages of development.
Advertisement
He believes that overcoming speciesist biases, along with a constant interest and interaction with the cosmic environment, must be desirable for any (even remotely) rational actors anywhere. But Cirkovic says there may be exceptions — like species who emerge from radically different environments, say, the atmospheres of Jovian planets. Such species would likely have a lack of interest in surrounding space, which would be invisible to them practically 99% of the time.
So if Sagan is correct, detecting an alien civilization at this point in our history would likely be a good thing. In addition to fostering science and technological development, it would motivate us to explore and colonize space. And who knows, it could even instigate significant cultural and political changes (including the advent of political parties both in support of and in opposition to all this). It could even lead to new religions, or eliminate them altogether.
Advertisement
Another possibility is that nothing would change. Life on Earth would go on as per usual as people work to pay their bills and keep a roof above their heads. There could be a kind of detachment to the whole thing, leading to a certain ambivalence.
At the same time however, it could lead to hysteria and paranoia. Even worse, and in twisted irony, the detection of a civilization equal to our own (or any life less advanced than us, for that matter) could be used to fuel the Great Filter Hypothesis of the Fermi Paradox. According to Oxford's Nick Bostrom, this would be a strong indication that doom awaits us in the (likely) near future — a filter that affects all civilizations at or near our current technological stage. The reason, says Bostrom, is that in the absence of a Great Filter, the galaxy should be teeming with super-advanced ETIs by now. Which it's clearly not.

Yikes. Stupid Fermi Paradox — always getting in the way of our future plans.

If you live in a big city, chances are you're estranged from stars. The arc of the Milky Way, Saturn's rings, threads of twirling nebulae—all of it gets lost behind that dense hood of light pollution most of us are too accustomed to even notice. For true, blacker-than-black, great beyond–type night skies (the kind you see in NASA satellite photographs), you've got to travel.
But where? According to astronomers at the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA)—which goes around the world, armed with light meters, measuring the darkness of the night sky in square arcseconds—the Southwest is the place to be. Specifically, Utah. Home to ancient hoodoos, sandstone cliffs, and the famous Delicate Arch, Utah is about as dark as you're going to get anywhere on land. And with Utah's stark geologic setting, it makes for one heck of a place to see stars. Here's how to plan your next road trip to the state's most stunning natural sites.
Diamonds in the SkyFly into St. George in southern Utah, where you'll drive a half-hour north along the edge of Zion National Park. Resist the temptation to enter, because you've got something way cooler ahead: Cedar Breaks National Monument towers at 10,400 feet in the air, and the higher altitude allows for unbelievably clear views of the night sky. Every Saturday from June to September, the park hosts free “star parties,” where rangers set up telescopes for the public to use. Detailed images of the moon's craters—not to mention the Perseid meteor shower—will leave you speechless, which is just as well, as the volunteer astronomers will be happy to do most of the talking.
Goblins and DevilsIn a remote corner of the Colorado Plateau, Goblin Valley State Park is one of Utah's most underrated gems. Wandering around at night, the valley's odd-shaped sandstone formations appear to come alive, like monsters in a children's storybook (hence the name)—and unlike in other parks, you can actually climb on the hoodoos. You'll keep busy even when you're not scouring the speckled horizon: whether that means a canyoneering trip through Devil's Lair, yoga on a cliff, or sampling the region's specialty—Navajo tacos—at a restaurant called Tamarisk. Plan on crashing at Skyfall Guestrooms, a nifty little hotel that sits along the Green River.
A Yurt With a ViewAccording to legend, Dead Horse Point State Park got its name around the turn of the century, after some mustangs were left corralled on a mesa top without access to water. Ironic, because the 6,000-foot-high plateau commands magnificent views of the Colorado River, snaking dreamily through the valley below. For just $80 a night, you can book one of the park's electricity-equipped yurts, and find yourself sleeping in the midst of a 200-million-year-old rocky landscape, which is recognized as a Gold-tier designated site by IDA. (There are some fantastic biking trails to explore, too.)
Where Dinosaurs Used to RoamFrom Dead Horse Point, pick up I-70, followed by Highway 139, which will take you on a detour through western Colorado. Eventually, you'll cross back into the Beehive State and wind up at Red Fleet State Park. Here, you can stand among dinosaur tracks laid down in the Jurassic Period, while gazing up at the 4-billion-year-old Milky Way (the ancients referred to it as a “river of milk” running across the sky). Gorgeous gold and red sandstone formations surround a large reservoir, and if the scenery proves so enchanting that you don't want to leave, well, you don't have to: Traditional teepees are available for camping, with a rental fee of just $30. Right outside the park, the dinosaur theme continues at Vernal Brewing Co.—order the Allosaurus Ale.
A Stellar Urban EscapeFrom Red Fleet, drive west to reach Antelope Island State Park. Despite being so close to Salt Lake City, the park managed to become Utah's newest Bronze-tier certified IDA park, thanks to the formidable Wasatch Mountain range, which blocks almost all light pollution coming from the city. Easily reached off the freeway, it's a favorite spot for locals to come stargaze, and is equally loved for its wildlife: The rugged wilderness preserve, which sits in the middle of a giant salt lake, is home to coyote, deer, and a native herd of 700 bison.
Saint Silouan the Athonite was born in 1866 in the Russian Empire to a peasant family. Near village where Saint Silouan was born, there was another settlement, in which Ivan Bykov lived – a man, who was canonized by the Church as the Blessed. His example of a true Christian life influenced the life of the future Athonite Saint and fostered his love for monasticism.
obedience taught him to look at a person in the likeness of God and to accept his neighbor as the child of God, as everyone who carries a part of the Father's image inside them. “If a person can see the Holy Spirit in his brother, then he is blessed himself as well”. These words were the main principle of his life. Saint Silouan considered love towards others bring a person closer to God, His Mysteries and slavation. If a person does not tend to this, then all other aspcets become meaningless and have no value. At the age of 19, Saint Silouan decided to enter the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, but his father insisted that the young man should go through military service first. As a result Saint Silouan served in the engineering battalion. In 1892 he came to Mount Athos and entered the Monastery of St. Panteleimon. In 1911 he was tonsured a schemamonk under the name Silouan. In the monastery father Silouan's obedience was in the role of a provisor, which demanded not only diligence, but also such qualities as sociability, patience in communication with brothers and mercy. Thistaught him to look at a person in the likeness of God and to accept his neighbor as the child of God, as everyone who carries a part of the Father's image inside them. “If a person can see the Holy Spirit in his brother, then he is blessed himself as well”. These words were the main principle of his life. Saint Silouan considered love towards others bring a person closer to God, His Mysteries and slavation. If a person does not tend to this, then all other aspcets become meaningless and have no value.
During that period of his life, Saint Silouan wrote his well-known notes, which were published in 1952 by his apprentice, schema-archimandrite Saphrony, which tell about his spiritual experience in Christ. Schema-archimandrite Saphrony made several comments on that book: “I mulled over sometimes, who Saint Silouan could become, if he had chosen another path and recieved higher education in science and theology. It would be easy to imagine him as someone who could greatly contirbute to society on a global scale”. Saint Silouan the Athonite passed away on September 24, 1938 after a brief illness.
“My soul misses God and tearfully tries to find Him” – these are the first words in the Saint's notes. Saint Silouan wrote that God is looking for a person even before this person finds Him. This resonates with the thought of Aphanasios the Great: God is always open for people, waiting for us just like the father, who was waiting for his prodigal son. God's love will save all of us, but this path leads through sacrifice. Saint Silouan marvels at the grace of God, as He never forces people to do anything, “He is just standing near our heart and waiting untill this very heart will open and accept Him”. However, he warns, that our personal freedom must not be considered as permissiveness. The true spiritual freedom is the “resurrection in Christ”, “ a resurrection before the resurrection ”, which is identified as an innner transfiguration of a person, according to Saint Symeon the New Theologian. Ultimately, freedom from sin is the base for any other freedom.
“ The grace of the Holy Spirit can make any person resemble Christ even in this world” – says Saint Silouan. These are the fruits of our fight against our own sins. And these fruits will bring salvation not only for us, but also for people around us. Saint Isaac the Syrian wrote: “What is a merciful heart? It is a heart which cares about everything created by God, about people, animals, about any other creature and even about demons… A person should pray with great compassion, a prayer which rises in his heart and makes his more in the likeness of God in this instance.” Silouan the Athonite says, that God teaches us not just to care about our close ones, but about any creature, and to be empathetic for any cruelty towards the wordless creatures. The grace of the Holy Spirit can make any person resemble Christ even in this world” – says Saint Silouan. These are the fruits of our fight against our own sins. And these fruits will bring salvation not only for us, but also for people around us. Saint Isaac the Syrian wrote: “What is a merciful heart? It is a heart which cares about everything created by God, about people, animals, about any other creature and even about demons… A person should pray with great compassion, a prayer which rises in his heart and makes his more in the likeness of God in this instance.” Silouan the Athonite says, that God teaches us not just to care about our close ones, but about any creature, and to be empathetic for any cruelty towards the wordless creatures.
However, the Saint reminds us, that a person is the greatest creation of God. Transfiguration of a human being is the key to the world transfiguration. And that is why Saint Silouan appeals in one of his sermons: “Dear Lord, bless the peoples of this world, and let them find You and know You… I pray to You, dear God, let them know you through the Holy Spirit.” Saint Silouan prayed for universal salvation through the Church – the Body of Christ. This Living Organism is united in the sacrament of Eucharist.
Untill his last days Saint Silouan the Athonite prayed for all the people living in this world and for those, who have passed away, for those whom he knew and those whom he had never seen, for friends and foes, for the whole world.

A helmet jellyfish exerting its reign of terror on a Norwegian fjord. Photo; Screen grab YouTube.
Norway's Beitstadfjord has been so severely invaded by monster deep sea jellyfish that, just two years since their arrival, they have driven out all of the local fish.
The innermost arm of the Trondheimsfjord now holds an estimated 40,000 tonnes of the helmet jellyfish, only a few years after the fiery red peril first appeared in its waters.
According to Norway's VG newspaper, Jarle Mork, a researcher at NTNU in Trondheim, caught vast quantities of the slimy animal in a single trawl.
"We took up 3.5 tons of monster jellyfish in under ten minutes," he said. "There was a tremendous amount more than we expected. The trawler winch was just about to give way."
Periphylla periphylla usually lives at depths of 1,000 meters but has in recent decades began invading the shallow waters of the fjords.
"The helmet jellyfish is a real beast which has now established itself as the top predator in the inner Trondheimsfjord," he said.
Rounded edges. Larger screen. But still no kill switch. Apple announced the latest “new features” for its iPhone smartphone line Tuesday. Once again, there was nothing that will help change the game when it comes to discouraging smartphone thieves. The phones are worth hundreds of dollars each — and nearly everybody walking across Capitol Hill is carrying one.
“10 years ago you could not guarantee that almost every person on the street had something worth $400 to $500 in their pockets,” SPD spokesperson Detective Drew Fowler tells CHS about one of the major drivers behind the return of the summer crime spike to Capitol Hill.
Earlier, CHS counted up the record-breaking reported robbery totals for the Capitol Hill area in August. Turns out, we've been undercounting.
Included in that number should be the growing number of pickpocket incidents around the Hill. In 2014 through August, the Capitol Hill has tallied 111 reported robberies and 47 reported pickpocket incidents. In 2013, the numbers for the same period were 115 reported robberies but only 33 reported pickpocket thefts. Not all of the robberies and thefts involved phones — but a check of recent incidents and incidents from last summer show the majority did.
Detective Fowler tells CHS that theft crimes that include the traditional grab of a wallet or phone from an unaware victim are classified as pickpocket incidents but apparently some types of snatch and run phone grabs also get thrown in the bucket. For a busted thief, the distinction could be important — a pickpocket theft is only a misdemeanor. But for those who get away with it, there is no difference — both are thieves who have made off with a new phone. UPDATE: Sounds like the difference is even more nuanced. Pickpocket is, indeed, also a felony level crime.
The mechanics of the crimes that have plagued the Hill this summer illustrate the fine line. A group of teens will stake out an area and watch for an opportunity to single out one or two victims away from busy streets and passersby. They'll attempt to take that person's property in the easiest way possible. Sometimes, it's simply running up and grabbing the phone or wallet. Other times, there is a confrontation and physical violence. If it comes to it, one of the group may be armed with a gun or a knife to make sure the job gets done. The line between the types of crime sometimes can be how the victim reacts. An added, thieve-y bonus: Victims are left without any means to quickly contact police.
Policing organizations have called on smartphone manufacturers to do more to make the phones have less value to thieves. They've also looked for federal help in breaking major smartphone rings like this FBI bust in Minnesota of a family funneling thousands of phones stolen across the nation into the Middle East and Chine where the unsubsidized and high-tariff markets command an even higher price for the technology.
In Seattle, SPD declines to provide any speculation about where the phones stolen on Capitol Hill end up but one officer told us that there are street buyers downtown that are known to do brisk business in phones and will work with behind the counter operations at shops across the city to funnel the stolen hardware overseas. You can also find some savvy phone crackers and wipers on the street doing a brisk business. If that's true, it's a mirror of what this report out of San Francisco documented about the fencing that goes down at Seventh in Market in that city.
Minnesota and, soon, California will require manufacturers to add “kill switch” features. Before other states jump in, the largest manufacturers have banded together to promise a database to track stolen phones and prevent their use in the United States. But that will do little to soften the worldwide demand for the devices. And that means they'll be as valuable as ever on the streets of Pike/Pine.
Earl Saturday morning, one of the gang squads assigned to Capitol Hill's entertainment district made their first bust of the new emphasis patrols. The first suspect they nailed? A pickpocket phone thief.
UPDATE: A couple commenters have been quick to point out that Apple has already shipped a de facto anti-theft capability. You can read about how to activate it here — and judge if the solution is really a kill switch.
UPDATE x2: And here's how easy it is for somebody in the chain to bust your iCloud password.
We're now five days away from hitting the deadline to get a deal done to raise the debt ceiling, and things aren't looking up for anybody interested in a “grand bargain”, or anything other than maintaining the status quo. What's even more depressing is that from a couple of negotiations, there seems to be an almost bi-partisan push to surrender lawmaking authority to either the executive branch or a small group of lawmakers beholden to practically nobody.
In one case, some lawmakers are considering giving the president authority to raise the debt ceiling by himself, using a vague interpretation of the 14th amendment that states that the ability of incur debt “shall not be questioned”. The other method, which is being supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), would allow a “Super Congress” to be formed, a 12-member body from the House and Senate that would have the exclusive power to draft legislation regarding the deficit, and the legislation couldn't be amended by either the House or Senate. It doesn't take much research to know that both of these proposals are disasters waiting to happen.
Starting with the “14th amendment solution”, which I mentioned in a previous “Constitution Watch” article, is a gross misinterpretation of one section of the Constitution, which disregards the part where it gives Congress the power to tax and spend. While I'm not surprised some of the President's advisors want him to involve the 14th amendment, I am surprised that some in Congress want to hand over decision making on the debt to the President so readily. As for the “Super Congress”, which is the proposed bicameral, bipartisan panel, it is just as bad. The deficit, which is getting closer to $2 trillion with no real end in sight, is one of the most important issues facing the legislature. Letting such a major issue be decided by 12 out of 535 members of Congress is unwise, especially if it's filled with legislators committed to tax increases rather than making any meaningful cuts. Unsurprisingly, this proposal is being attacked by both the left and right as an unconstitutional power-grab that shuts out 96% of legislators to the decision making process, and reduces their role to a simple “yea or nay” vote on whatever the panel comes up with.

Danielle Smith knew she was in trouble. It was late November and Wildrose was in disarray. She was losing friends and supporters to the "old and tired" Progressive Conservative Party she had spent her career criticizing. After only a few weeks in the Premier's office, Jim Prentice had undone years of steady gains by her Official Opposition and had co-opted much of her playbook.
Before Mr. Prentice's first day in the Legislature, before he faced his first volley in Question Period, before the falling price of oil broke the province's budget, negotiations had already begun between members of Ms. Smith's party and the Tories. Plans were being hatched for a mass defection of anywhere from a few MLAs to her entire caucus.
Back in her hometown of High River, still rebuilding from the disastrous 2013 floods, Ms. Smith hadn't had the success she'd hoped getting money flowing. Despite a run as one of the province's most successful opposition leaders, she began thinking it was time to stop fighting and join a Premier whose politics she was starting to admire.

It was time for Danielle Smith's second act in Alberta politics. What she set in motion would lead to one of the most significant upheavals in Alberta politics and one of Canada's more shocking political betrayals. First, she had to find out who was with her.
The call
Even Mr. Prentice didn't believe the first inquiry about a mass defection by one of Ms. Smith's lieutenants was serious. During the week of Nov. 10, a Wildrose MLA approached Mr. Prentice's chief of staff, Mike Percy. There had been some chatter between MLAs in both parties about floor crossings, but this was different. The request for a meeting was brought to Mr. Prentice.
"I said, 'Have a cup of coffee, see if it's serious.' I didn't actually think it was a serious inquiry, initially. They had a couple of discussions and it became evident that this was serious and more than a single person was interested," Mr. Prentice said Thursday.
The first conversation came after four by-election losses on Oct. 28 that stung Wildrose. While the party had long been seen as a potential government-in-waiting, its strength was based in rural southern Alberta. To end the 43-year Tory dynasty, Ms. Smith knew that Wildrose would need to seduce voters in Edmonton and Calgary. In the by-elections, the party stumbled backward, losing support.
"We fought the by-elections tooth-and-nail and I was surprised with the results. That's when I confronted the fact for the first time that we had not succeeded in convincing mainstream Alberta voters in Calgary and Edmonton that we were an option for them," she said.
As panic began to set in, conversations continued between Mr. Percy and his Wildrose contact. Mr. Prentice then pushed talks to a higher level, sending Government Whip George VanderBurg to negotiate with a Wildrose team that included party House Leader Rob Anderson – himself a former Tory who had defected in the past to Wildrose.

While much of the Wildrose caucus was looking for an exit, the party seemed to erupt in open rebellion. Hours after Ms. Smith endorsed an anti-discrimination policy at a Wildrose conference on Nov. 14, party members voted to reject the policy. Since being elected leader in 2009, Ms. Smith had spent years trying to recast the party as LGBT-friendly. When Wildrose was poised for a breakthrough in the 2012 election, it came to light that candidate Allan Hunsperger had earlier written about gays and lesbians, saying they would "suffer the rest of eternity in the lake of fire."
At the ballot box, some voters decided Ms. Smith and her party were too rough around the edges to the run the province. The policy in November had been her attempt to mend fences. Her years of hard work evaporated in a show of hands. Ms. Smith later learned that members of the powerful socially conservative wing of the party were angry with her attempts to recast Wildrose as a moderate party. The policy was thrown out as a form of punishment.
"I wasn't interested in leading an increasingly strident right-wing party. I wanted to create a party that was mainstream and could form government. When I looked at Mr. Prentice, his policy ideas, resolve and shared interests, there isn't a lot of difference between what he wants to do in government and what I want to do," she said.
A week later on Nov. 24, Ms. Smith lost two of her closest allies – MLAs Ian Donovan and Kerry Towle defected to the Tories.
Publicly, Ms. Smith chastised the two for being seduced by the "perks of power," going as far as to say that her friendship with Ms. Towle was over. A senior Wildrose official confirmed that hours after Ms. Smith announced there would be no more defections, she was confronted with the ongoing negotiations with Mr. Percy and was given an ultimatum to join the mass defection. "There were no meetings or negotiations approved by Danielle before then, [the revolt] was a fait accompli," said the source.
In the weeks that followed, many commented that Ms. Smith seemed defeated and had lost her zest during debates. Privately, she realized that her time at Wildrose was coming to an end.

The last days
Only hours after she had stood in the House during the last day of the legislative session on Dec. 10, Ms. Smith drove to Edmonton's Fairmount Hotel MacDonald and met Mr. Prentice for the first time.
While the Premier maintains he initiated none of the conversations with Wildrose members to defect, he did call for the meeting with Ms. Smith. He thought the time was right to look her in the eye and see if she was serious.
"My situation changed when I met Mr. Prentice," said Ms. Smith of the meeting. "I find him sincere, I think he has a firm grasp on what needs to be done. He's been very honest about the challenges we face."
Things moved quickly after that. Word began to spread beyond the Wildrose caucus of what was developing. A document was drawn up, pledging the Tories to adopt many of the Wildrose policies – allowing free votes on moral issues, upholding parent and landowner rights, and committing to increasing patient choice in health care.
After a series of difficult one-on-one meetings with her MLAs, Ms. Smith brought the proposal to her caucus the following Tuesday. The debate was far from settled and the number of MLAs willing to make the jump continued to fluctuate throughout the day. In the afternoon, former Reform Leader Preston Manning was brought in to give his advice.

"I told them that they should take pride in what they'd accomplished. They managed to get change in the government leadership to someone compatible with their values," said Mr. Manning, of his one hour conversation with the caucus.
By the time Mr. Manning left, the caucus was still debating. That evening, sources say a number of Wildrose MLAs met with Mr. Prentice. According to the Premier, he was still unsure how many were willing to defect the next morning when he met with his own party to approve the deal.
A source from Wildrose with knowledge of the process confirms a deal was on the table to give Ms. Smith and Mr. Anderson cabinet posts. However, the lengthy PC caucus meeting at Government House on Wednesday torpedoed that.
It became clear to Mr. Prentice that "it wasn't going to be easy to bring them in in any meaningful way," the source said.
That evening, Mr. Prentice stood by Ms. Smith as he announced that she and eight members of her caucus were becoming Tories. The long negotiation was complete.
The rise and fall of Wildrose
Story continues below advertisement
The phone messages and e-mails continue to pour in to Ms. Smith's High River headquarters. Office manager Lynn Bailey gets to respond to the many questions and grenades lobbed her way.
Two-thirds of the commentary has taken Ms. Smith to task for joining the Tories and abandoning Wildrose. That's not surprising, said Ms. Bailey. "You always hear the negative stuff first."
Those who posted to Facebook and Tweeted their anger have stuck to familiar themes: Ms. Smith betrayed her constituents by parlaying principles for a position of power; she didn't fight nearly as hard as she could have to help those affected by the flooding.
Ms. Smith had advocated for the people who needed government assistance to rebuild their lives. However, she wasn't able to satisfy everyone who qualified for the Disaster Recovery Program.
In October, the minister of Alberta municipal affairs produced some startling numbers. Of the 4,591 DRP applications filed, 1,174 remained unresolved; 952 of those unsettled claims were on hold. There is talk that Ms. Smith will be able to do more now that she's part of the PC machinery.
"I'm really hopeful that she's able to do as part of the government what she wasn't able to do as opposition leader – and that was to get the government to speed up and settle claims," said Bruce Masterman, a High River councillor and a member of the DRP committee. "These things need to be settled."
Story continues below advertisement
Town Mayor Craig Snodgrass agreed that DRP has "failed the individual."
"With Danielle being leader of the Wildrose, I didn't need to use her very much. The biggest reason was I needed a chequebook," Mr. Snodgrass said. "I needed the guys who write the cheques. Now she's in a position of power and has access to the finances we require."
What next?
There is little doubt this is a marriage of political convenience. Mr. Prentice needs Ms. Smith and her former Wildrose members to keep the Tories connected in rural Alberta; Ms. Smith needs the PCs' clout to get things done. With both parties so ideologically close to one another, Ms. Smith said she was finished being the "armchair quarterback" in the legislature. Instead of bringing criticism daily, she said it was time to unite Alberta's conservative family.
That said, questions abound. Which party is now the official opposition? If both Wildrose and the Liberals have the same number of seats, does the call go to the Wildrose for having been the opposition under Ms. Smith? And really, does it matter? The Tories have tightened their grip on Alberta and there are no real challengers on the scene.
As for the once promising Wildrose, this is what it has come to: A funding website has been set up to raise money to "help ease the sudden unemployment of WRP staff due to the floor crossing of MLAs less than ten days to Christmas. Four of these employees are to be parents in a few months."

HASAKA, SyriaHASAKA, Syria (Reuters) - Women fighters danced to Kurdish songs in a village in northern Syria on Wednesday after completing their military training to join the battle against Islamic State.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of local militias supported by a U.S.-led coalition, had given the 210 women a 15-day course in armed combat.
Trainers taught the women weapons handling, tactics and first aid.

"The goal ... is to stand up against Daesh, to stand up to them and tell them that the woman is strong," said new recruit Layla Hussein, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
Jihan Sheikh Ahmed, the SDF spokeswoman for the Raqqa campaign, said the women would be mainly deployed to the battlefront against Islamic State in Raqqa.
Another course will start in two months, she added, and there will be more as the demand continues.
Hussein said her training had included ideology sessions.
The SDF is dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, which follows the leftist ideology of Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has fought a three-decade insurgency in Turkey.
The spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition initially said all the women who had been trained in that group were Arab but later said it was checking that information. A witness to the ceremony said some of the new fighters were Kurdish.

"Since the beginning of the revolution and continuing on until now, the main casualties of war have been women," said Sarya Mahmoud, a trainer and commander in the YPJ, the all-female brigade in the YPG.
The female fighters give hope to women in the towns they liberate, Mahmoud said, "because we're going to free them and give them the volition they lost years ago, not just from Daesh, but from the male mentality and the government mentality."
The new SDF fighters came from different parts of northern Syria, including Deir al-Zor, Raqqa, and Aleppo, and will be deployed directly to Raqqa, where the SDF launched a campaign to seize the city from Islamic State forces in early June.
Islamic State has lost large expanses of territory in Syria over the last year to separate campaigns waged by the SDF, the Russian-backed Syrian military, and Turkey-backed Syrian rebels.
(Story corrects paragraph 9 after U.S.-led coalition said it was checking information it had previously supplied that all the women trained were Arab.)
Sneaky Bastards made its way to E3 for hands-on time with Eidos Montreal's Thief and a conversation with Producer Stephane Roy.
October 17 Update: Thief's XP System Removed Eidos Montreal has removed Thief's XP system, and clarified its reasoning in a community blog: “…the E3 reaction was right, rewarding killing like that was wrong for a Master Thief.” http://community.eidosmontreal.com/blogs/Take-5-QA-4
Where to begin? Our first impressions of Eidos Montreal's Thief reboot, a tumultuous project that has spent years in some state of production and endured a number of resets, were positive. That was a hands-off affair, one in which Eidos Montreal walked us through a vertical slice; one in which we later learned the AI was apparently disabled.
This time, we played through a level ourselves, the AI definitely functioning. The mission played out in three distinct phases – distinct, by being separated by a loading zone masked first by mashing a button to jimmy open a window, and second by a third-person cutscene. The first phase took place in a manor courtyard, tasking Garrett with infiltrating the building to steal a large jewel. The second phase took place inside the manor, and was more puzzle-focused, with Garrett searching for secret rooms and switches. The third phase saw Garrett escaping the manor in the midst of a riot by crossing a bridge that itself was on fire – and collapsing. The above footage, courtesy of Machinima, is of the first phase infiltrating the manor. Publisher Square-Enix has not released any video of the burning bridge escape, so we've inserted a gameplay approximation below:
We are not exaggerating. The sequences are brimming with scripted events; first-person cutscenes in which something collapses in front of Garrett and then he makes a jump to safety in slow motion. At one point the camera cuts to third-person as Garrett climbs away from explosions along the side of a building. An explosion throws him free, he loses his grip and falls – when a quick-time event prompt appears to perform an “aerial save”, which sees Garrett throw is grappling hook at a grate, which finds purchase at the last second, so he can continue climbing. These are the “extreme situations; memorable scripted sequences with altered controls, camera and/or gameplay rules” that cropped up some time ago on a Thief developer's now-edited CV.
Our first question to Producer Stephane Roy was what this sequence was doing in this game, at this point in gameplay.
“You're not the first talking about it,” he began. “So, the high level perspective, the gameplay is ‘infiltration, stealing, escaping'. This section, the burning bridge, is really the escaping moment. It's a tool for us, and the level designer, to give a rhythm to the game. Infiltration is just fun, playing with them [the AI], driving them crazy, it's just cool. But if I give you ice cream every day… you know. We want to change the rhythm. The escaping moment is really where we have this adrenaline rush, and now you have to escape, shit hits the fan, you just have to save your arse. “That said… it's not always like that. Escaping, for us, it's not always like that. Escaping could be very quiet. Just get out. Nobody should see you. It should be like… ghost. So, for this one, we're at E3, there is explosion everywhere, it's USA… so, you're right, it's more over the top because there's a big revolution, a riot, but there are other escaping moments that are really, you're a Thief, you're a ghost.”
We're at E3, there is explosion everywhere, it's USA… so, you're right, it's more over the top
Yet we still found this philosophy contradictory. The mantra for Eidos Montreal's Thief has, from even before its GDC reveal, to offer the player the tools and abilities to play the way they want – moreso than the previous Thief trilogy. It is possible to play Thief aggressively – difficult, but possible. It's also possible to complete the game non-lethally, or as a ghost. This was all true of the previous titles, but the difference here is that Eidos Montreal is baking in mechanics that it feels further supports each type of approach. Where the contradiction arises is in the game itself beginning to dictate a playstyle for the sake of rhythm, when players have the ability to define the rhythm at all other points in time. “I have the feeling that you think that I'm going to hold your hand for all the game,” Roy replies. “That's really not our intention. For this franchise, Thief, the narrative is really, really important. All the background story, all this documentation you can read, and stuff like that. It's really a story-driven game. So I want to tell you an amazing story. Where we're going, where we really want to give you a lot of freedom, is in all these opportunities.
“So, this demo. Go in the manor. Crystal clear, no frustration. You know what to do. You know where to go. How you do it – this is where we want your freedom. A lot of opportunities. A lot of ways to play. Aggressive. Non-lethally. It's up to you… it's your playground. You had a bad day, last night, you feel aggressive, perfect. Use your arrows and have fun. So this is where we really want to give you all the tools. We're going to build these maps, this universe, to let you figure out – all the ingredients will be there – what type of fun I want to have today.” Yet this spoke to our major concern with the demo – one far greater than the insipid, dated nature of the burning bridge sequence. The “ingredients” that featured within the level did not feel general-purpose and consistent. They were not systems; they were hand-placed, hard-coded points of interest. Case in point (no pun intended): rope arrows. Previously, Garrett's rope arrow stuck to any wooden surface, after which a climbable rope would unfurl from its point of impact. Here, rope arrows only attach to specifically marked anchor points that have been placed by level designers – anchor points that seemed to exist when the only way forward was through the use of a rope arrow. “It's a question of production choice,” Roy explains. “If I give you the possibility to shoot the rope arrow everywhere, I will have to cut something. I will have to reduce our intention for the narrative. If it's everywhere, the cost of it is to block your view, because it's still a console. It's still tech. By having a smart level design, by making sure that feels natural that here you can go – not scripted, but you check and if you feel that you should be able to do that and it's there, the job is done. If it's not frustrating, the job is done.”
“If I give you the possibility to shoot the rope arrow everywhere…. I will have to reduce our intention for the narrative”
What Roy is referring to is the amount of environmental geometry that can be rendered in the player's field of view at once. Modern console games use very complex, tricky methods to block and obscure enough of the geometry that the frames-per-second target can be maintained. If the player is suddenly able to travel beyond the extent of those implemented blocks – if they are able to elevate themselves and observe a far greater portion of the environment than Eidos Montreal anticipated – the game would suffer frame drop.
But this is something that worked fifteen years ago. Technology has advanced in the name of stunning visuals, which only translate to environmental density rather than scale – let alone the player's freedom to explore that scale. Thief: Deadly Shadows even experienced this, bisecting its levels with load zones to fit within the previous console generation's memory limitations. Exactly what Roy is referring to when he says the ability to shoot rope arrows anywhere would result in cuts to the narrative is unclear, but we'd hazard a guess that he's referring to this environmental density, or the memory required for scripted sequences like the burning bridge which Eidos Montreal believes is some kind of storytelling. To reference Deadly Shadows again – Ion Storm couldn't get rope arrows working in the engine, much to the disappointment of fans. But the climbing gloves created in place of them still allowed Garrett to scale any stone surface. “Here, we control the cost of production,” Roy continues. “It's not just money, it's also all the effort. If you can check everywhere, and the artist has to block everything, at the end we have an amazing sandbox and… that's it. By controlling a little bit where we put the ingredients, it makes sure that we have a lot of variation, it's not too repetitive, and if it's well done it should be transparent for you.” Though this Thief is a new, different game, Roy is adamant that he and the development team want to respect fans of the series. We can't fathom a harder slap in the face.
It is a design philosophy that ties into one of Thief's major new additions: Focus mode. Key objects are highlighted in blue, whilst guards' footsteps are visible through walls. It also ‘amplifies' Garrett's ability to pickpocket – stealing in Focus mode is far quicker, and allows multiple items to be grabbed in a single swoop. Roy is clear that Focus mode can be disabled for those who do not wish to use it. But its presence is still troubling, for much of the key information that should be communicated by the environment has been moved not just to this vision mode, but to the user interface itself. “It's a good comment,” says Roy. “If you tell me that, it's because we still have to work on that. Personally, I really like the Focus feature. Personally, I don't think that you cheat by using it. It's really a part of the answer to why Garrett is the master, and not just… another one. “You don't have to use it. So what does that mean? It means that we have to work very hard to make sure that you're going to be able to read the environment without that. In this demo, if your feeling is that, without the Eye, it would have been complicated, it means that we still have to work hard to make sure that, without it, you are going to be able to progress. But it's going to be harder. The Focus is really linked with the story. It's not a gimmick, like magic. That's why we designed the game with it.”
Focus is a way to essentially gamify Garrett's nature as a master thief; a shortcut to making players ‘feel' like a master, rather than by having them master the systems and environment on their own. Why does Thief need this? “With the next-gen, with the smartphone, with the tablet, with the indie developer, it's really, really cool because now we have a lot of different types of players. There is a type of people that like to have that kind of indicator, because… they don't want to fight with all these mechanics. They enjoy the story, they want to progress, they want to feel that they are good, but at the same time they like to, you know, ‘let me help you a little bit'.
They don't want to fight with all these mechanics. They enjoy the story, they want to progress, they want to feel that they are good
“We are working very hard to respect these different types of player. Honestly, it's like, let's say you are at home, you like to write, and you have a novel in your drawer that you would like to share. I'm pretty sure you don't write for one guy; you want to make sure a lot of people would see the story. It's the same thing to us. But we really want to be respectful to the fanbase. That's why Focus, you can disable it. You can play this game from A to Z without killing anybody. You can even finish this game in a non-lethal way. All these layers will be there. But if it's story and stuff like that, we'll give you Focus, indicators, to just make sure that you enjoy the experience.”
A light gem is still one of those indicators. It's tucked down in the bottom left corner of the screen, and exhibits three states: hidden, partially visible and fully visible. In addition to the light gem is the Shroud – a murky vignette that surrounds the edge of the screen, constantly undulating as Garrett remains in shadow. Leaving the safety of darkness causes the Shroud to flash brilliant white; an effect that quickly became distracting. We understand Eidos Montreal's desire to move players' attention away from the light gem, but the Shroud was one of the chief elements preventing us from ever feeling immersed in the world. “This is where our job is really complex,” says Roy. “Why? Because I can understand your point of view. But I receive other comments that this flash, people were really in love with it, because they don't have to check the gem. Just having that flash, they understand ‘Okay, the situation has changed'. So now, they forget the rest, and when there is that small tick, they understand, ‘Okay, now I should swoop, and come back.' But, let's say it's a jury with yes or no. It could be fifty-fifty. So here, this is where we have to trust our instinct and move forward. It's impossible to please everybody, so we try to find the best solution.”
We thank Roy for his time, and his candour, and think back to the end of the demo, in which Garrett completes his slow motion vault to the end of the exploding bridge. We leave the room and head back into the fray – back to E3, to explosions everywhere, to the USA – feeling ill.
After the Giants squeaked out a 30-27 victory Sunday night over the San Francisco 49ers and dedicated it to struggling tight end Daniel Fells, veteran linebacker Mark Herzlich stood at his locker and spoke with the exuberance of a 10-year-old in a candy store.
Herzlich was telling a younger player that feeling they were experiencing was exactly why they play the game. The Giants and 49ers went back and forth in the final minutes. The Giants eventually prevailed on tight end Larry Donnell's leaping 12-yard touchdown reception with 21 seconds remaining.
From start to finish it wasn't perfect. But it was good enough.
The film review told exactly the same story. It wasn't perfect, but it was good enough.
RELATED: Why the Giants are in better shape heading to Philly this year
Let's start with rookie safety Landon Collins. I watched him closely and saw some really positive attributes and qualities. It was his best game of the season. Collins was a playmaker near the line of scrimmage, and especially effective as a blitzer. He also held his own in pass coverage, even though he wasn't tested often.
Here Collins comes off the edge. His speed and power are too much for tight end Vance McDonald to handle.
McDonald gets a piece of Collins, but this is a 220-pound safety. He's solid and strong. It's not enough to slow Collins down. Even though the rookie doesn't get credited with a tackle, he blew up this play. 49ers running back Carlos Hyde was tackled for a 1-yard loss.
Collins did some good things against the pass as well. On this play, it appears he makes a late check and moves up several yards into the middle of the field. This allows him to reach the flat and tackle McDonald for a 3-yard gain on second-and-17.
Watching Collins run and make plays it's obvious he can be a substantial player in the NFL. He had six tackles and a pass defended in the contest.
But there were also times he looked like a rookie. That seems to be his biggest downfall at this point.
There was a play late in the first half where Collins showed blitz too early. San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick noticed him itching at the line of scrimmage and easily dumped a pass to fullback Bruce Miller in the flat for a 19-yard gain.
It's these little things he needs to improve. Included in this are his comfort and technique in coverage. There was more than one occasion where Collins was turned backwards trying to cover downfield.
With time, these seem like correctable mistakes. Collins, who is already one of the team's better defensive playmakers, will be one of its best players.
10 observations
1. Quarterback Eli Manning navigated the pocket and some pretty consistent pressure better than at any time in my two-plus seasons covering the team. He stepped up in the pocket and slid around smoothly in order to create completions. This isn't usually one of his strengths. It played a large part in completing 75 percent of his passes, throwing for 441 yards and three touchdowns.
2. Star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. really did seem to hurt his hamstring several plays before scoring a third-quarter touchdown. (More on this later Thursday).
3. Thrust into a starting role, Herzlich was a huge asset against the run. There were at least three or four plays he effectively protected the edge and made plays. On this one, he takes on pulling guard Alex Boone, barely budges and completely ruins this run. Even though he didn't get credited with the tackle, Herzlich blew up the play. This happened regularly throughout the contest. Herzlich was strong against the run and wasn't exploited in coverage. He did a quality job filling in for Devon Kennard on run downs.
4. It was really the interior of the Giants' line that allowed quarterback Eli Manning to have such a big game. With tackles Marshall Newhouse and Ereck Flowers struggling, Manning was able to step up in the pocket and consistently make throws. Lots of credit goes to guard Justin Pugh and Geoff Schwartz and center Weston Richburg.
This was a big play to Beckham early in the game:
This was the touchdown to Beckham late in the third quarter:
5. You have to be impressed with the way Richburg has played this season. He's been a huge upgrade over J.D. Walton. The job he did on this monstrous 24-yard screen pass with under a minute remaining was instrumental in leading to the game-winning touchdown two plays later. Last year's second-round pick (No. 70) is a player.
6. Rookie defensive end Owa Odighizuwa had another non-descript outing. Odighizuwa struggled as a pass rusher, in part because he's getting matched mostly vs. the opposition's left tackle. He was slightly more effective vs. the run. This is likely going to be the case with Odighizuwa this season. He's not a seasoned pass rusher. He has just three pressures in 52 pass rush snaps in his first two career games. That's not good.
7. Running back Shane Vereen has been exactly what the Giants paid for this offseason. He's added a new dimension to the offense, and can't be guarded 1-on-1 by most linebackers or safeties. The final drive was further evidence.
Here rookie safety Jaquiski Tartt is no match. Vereen's route-running is too polished.
This was an easy 16-yard gain on the final drive. Vereen had three catches for 51 yards on that quick game-winning march down field.
8. Defensive end Damontre Moore again proved disruptive in limited snaps. Even though he was dominated on the one run to his side, he still hustled to get in on the tackle downfield. He also had two sacks, a tackle for a loss, a quarterback hit and a forced fumble. Despite his deficiencies, the Giants need his playmaking ability on the field more.
9. Linebacker Devin Unga was going to be the nickel linebacker over Jon Beason (at least part of the time) even before Beason left with a concussion. That was evident when he entered on the second play of the game.
10. Cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie threw his body around again. He's certainly not playing soft, as his reputation suggested. Cromartie had six tackles and is on pace for a career high in tackles despite missing a game with a concussion.

Liverpool have drawn seven of their past eight games in all competitions
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp endured a frustrating first game at Anfield as the Reds were held to a draw by 10-man Rubin Kazan in the Europa League.
The visitors took the lead through Marko Devic's stunning half-volley but had captain Oleg Kuzmin sent off for a second yellow card soon after.
Liverpool responded as Emre Can stab in following a free-kick.
Substitute Christian Beneteke hit the post late on as Liverpool were held to a third successive Group B draw.
Despite pressing late on, it was ultimately a difficult evening for Klopp and Liverpool as they struggled to break down their Russian opponents for large periods of the match.
The result leaves Liverpool second in their group on three points, four behind leaders FC Sion.
Liverpool owners John W Henry and Tom Werner were in the stands on Thursday
King of the Kop, but work to do
The arrival of Klopp has been greeted with excitement by Liverpool fans since he was confirmed as successor to Brendan Rodgers.
The 48-year-old's first appearance in a Liverpool dugout was at Tottenham last weekend but Thursday marked his first competitive appearance at Anfield.
In his programme notes, Klopp praised the "special atmosphere" the fans created, and they certainly extended a warm welcome for the German.
Stall traders sold scarves outside the ground boasting "the Klopp revolution", while fans waited eagerly for autographs and a photo with their new manager.
It was not only the fans who were keen to witness Klopp's first game in charge, with the club's owners having flown in for the game.
Klopp's appearance from the tunnel just before kick-off was met with rapturous applause, but any excitement about a new era gave way to frustration as Liverpool's familiar failings this season were once again on show.
Thousands of Liverpool fans made their way to Anfield for the Europa League tie to greet their new manager
Klopp took charge of Liverpool on 8 October, with his first game in charge a goalless draw at Tottenham last weekend
Klopp appeared to have bought a new coat to mark his first game in charge of Liverpool
Any signs of encouragement?
Under Klopp, Dortmund reached the Champions League final in 2012-13 and climbed from 110th to 13th in the Uefa rankings.
Liverpool fans will hope he can have a similar impact at the Reds. They are currently ranked 54th in Europe, sandwiched between FC Genk and APOEL.
Europa League success is perhaps not the supporters' priority, but they will welcome improved displays in the competition after disappointing draws against Bordeaux and FC Sion this season.
Liverpool's early endeavour against Rubin Kazan was encouraging as they played quick, one-touch football and attacked at pace.
However, when Rubin took the lead, albeit against the run of play, Liverpool - along with the home fans' enthusiasm - faded.
Kuzmin's sending-off - he was shown a second yellow card for stopping Can - and Can's subsequent equaliser lifted Anfield again.
Liverpool, though, failed to build on that.
Despite a late flurry as Rubin Kazan's players retreated further into their own half to protect the point, the hosts lacked the creativity to score a winner.
Man of the match: Emre Can
Not many players shone for Liverpool, Emre Can's run led to Oleg Kuzmin's sending-off before he scored the first goal of the Jurgen Klopp era
'Not a masterclass'
Klopp felt Liverpool had their moments, but accepted the sending off made it more difficult for his side.
"It was a very interesting game, a big challenge because of the quality of Rubin," he said.
"Sometimes it is a big advantage against 10 men, most of the time they stop playing football and defend in a compact block.
"It was not a masterclass but it was not the worst day in my life."
Klopp was appreciative of the reception the Liverpool fans gave him, adding: "It was one of the best moments for me.
"I felt everything positive and then I concentrated on the game."
What next for Liverpool?
It is another home game for Klopp as Liverpool entertain Southampton on Sunday. Their next Europa League game is at Rubin Kazan on 5 November.
The stats you need to know
Liverpool is winless in their last eight group stage matches in Europa League or Champions League (D5 L3), drawing each of the last five.
The Reds had 35 shots in this match (including blocks), Rubin Kazan had five.
Liverpool have kept just one clean sheet in seven games at Anfield this season (v Bournemouth in August).
Rubin Kazan have received a red card in two of their three Europa League group stage matches this season (also v Bordeaux)
You might be thinking, now that fewer people are relying on cable and more are watching broadband streaming, shouldn't all the juggernaut TV companies just wither away and die? Well, that's part of the problem -- they aren't going without a fight, and in a desperate attempt to stay afloat, they might seriously end up merging into supergiant conglomerate companies that will make S.P.E.C.T.R.E. look like a mom-and-pop operation.

This isn't just us putting on our tinfoil hats. In February, Comcast and Time Warner Cable started talks of merging into one company, and just a couple of weeks ago, AT&T began plans to buy DirecTV ... which is only a month after AT&T was found trying to get in bed with Dish Network. Yes, at this point, the relationships between big television companies sound like something straight out of one of their daytime soaps. That Warner/Comcast merger ("The WC," probably) would cause 30 million customers to fall under the same umbrella, while the DirecTV/AT&T one ("DirecTV&AT&T") would result in a ball of 26 million subscribers. More people would subscribe to that one company than live in Australia.
Those are scary numbers, but wouldn't the FCC stop something like that from happening? Nope, they've already said they wouldn't do shit about the Warner/Comcast one, because technically, there's little overlap in the areas covered by both companies -- we're sure the fact that the FCC is run by former Comcast lawyers and TV lobbyists is just a funny coincidence. What they're conveniently overlooking is that, even if these companies weren't directly competing with each other, the resulting hypermegacorporations would be big enough to bully everyone they do compete with into having their own way. And if there's no competition in a specific area? They can raise prices and no one can do shit about it, and there's no reason for them to give a crap about improving their service.
It has become such a workable way of life, for me, the most natural rhythm; I barely give it much thought. I know at which hours I will be most productive, and where; the best music to write to — Bruce Springsteen, or Hole; and what to listen to while I read — nothing. I've learned that to be somewhere by noon, I must tell myself 11:30, and I'll set my watch ahead to ensure this works out.
Even the medicinal maintenance of my Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), the stimulant cocktail of four kinds of amphetamine salt — manufactured by Shire Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Adderall — is an automatic affair: My typing will become slower or sloppier, I'll forget my wording or leave something out, the same line will have to be reread several times over before it's finally processed. I'll become suddenly quite ravenous and restless. Typically loathsome tasks — like unloading the dishwasher or fleecing my furniture of cat hair or replacing the too-high lightbulbs — will seem urgent or enjoyable or both. Then I'll know it's time to take another pill.
It happens like this every day, always at the same times of day, and I am never wrong. But none of this many matters, unless I make one point: For the longest time, everything felt off. Or rather, everything in me felt off. Like a film playing in slow-motion, with its subtitles sped up. My mind would stall and surge, slippery with short-circuits, prone to laser-beam intensity one day and languishing the next.
I often struggled in school, was told I could and should do better, yet unable, believed myself intellectually inferior (peculiar only because of the precocious reading habit that was my sole sustained engagement). Jobs, internships, myriad extracurricular pursuits — each of them thrilling upon first prospect — fizzled-out early and often. No one saw anything too out of the ordinary. I was just “lazy,” “irresponsible,” “a careless student,” “disorganized,” and always in the throes of some procrastinated chaos. And because I'd never known any different — it's not like I made things difficult for fun — I believed that it was ultimately nothing, that this was just who I was and would be forever on. Passionless, aimless. Unmoored.
The classic conception of ADD, the acute characterization, is that of a child on turbocharge: prolix and chatty, a blur of fingers and kneecaps; she will be running a marathon even when she is seated and still.
But I have never been an earthquake of activity. I don't hop fences or collect speeding tickets. I've never broken a bone or run through pane-glass. My frenetic energy, my fragmented focus, is manifest inward. It's marking 26-Across in 30-Down, in the Sunday puzzle, unnoticed and in pen. It's MetroCards misplaced, essays turned in late, library books long overdue. It's hundreds of dollars paid to collections agencies for forgotten overdrafts that started as single digits, and credit cards lost so often that the banks believe it is fraud. It's multiple concurrently-kept day-planners, and not one of them ever current. It's running out to the store for batteries and coming back with blank notebooks and tea.
As errors go, mine were far from exceptional. We are all overwhelmed. We all get distracted. None of us is privileged with an excess of time. There is nothing especially sympathetic about a girl who cannot keep a deadline. The problem is hers alone.
When I am 19, I have my first taste of cocaine, and soon things look not so bad. Because cocaine is so self-gratifying — it's all you want and need and feel is important in the world — and gratification is just about all I'd been looking for, I believe I have discovered my antidote. Daily, hourly, for many months, I carefully maintain this not high but level-feeling state of being. Each line sharpening my sight, I am made more consciously and comfortably present. And I have no intention of stopping this new, novel form of self-treatment. It seems almost too easy. And too easy not to let go.
All my apathy and line-towing really ought to have been enough, but of course it takes this most clearly identifiable state of crisis, a behavior so glaring, so explicitly ill-boding — only with this does anyone pause to consider that there may be something actually wrong.
In the fall of 2008, I sit out what ought to be the first semester of my sophomore year of college, as much for the cocaine as for everything else. I go to therapy sessions and meet with doctors and specialists in all fields, desperate for something — anything — to jumpstart me out of this murky in-between of not caring and not caring to. I try Celexa, then Lexapro, then Wellbutrin, then others — the idea being that the right antidepressant will lift me out from under this torpor. They do not help. Drugs are exactly what I need, but these are not right, they are treating the wrong thing; their logic is bad.
Months pass in this way, and I begin to wonder whether there might not be a better explanation, a surer solution for all my blue moods and lazy disinterest. Maybe we've ignored some effective, alternative treatment for depression. Or maybe it's not depression at all. Alone in this suspicion, and unable to bear the thought of another false fix, I resolve to find the answer for myself.
ADD had at no point been a planned area of inquiry, but somewhere along my circuitous path of research, co-morbid diagnoses become increasingly relevant; In my case, depression and anxiety seem the manifest symptoms of a larger unknown. I rule nothing out, yet the variables — depression, anxiety, female, young adult — point unfailingly to the same probable cause. I learn that girls, for whatever biological reason, tend to have Added without the more obvious hyperactivity component; their primary symptom is distractibility. It would make sense, then, for unchecked ADD to be perceived as depression and anxiety: In school, one's performance is graded from any early age, and with the certain impediment of such chronic distraction, feelings of low self-worth are stoked with every admonishment and failing mark; the adult world is no more forgiving.

Aaron Ramsey: As good as Bale, says Chris Coleman
Bale, the world's most expensive player after his move to Real Madrid from Spurs in the summer, has long been viewed as Wales' top player.
He scored four of Wales' nine goals in their unsuccessful World Cup qualifying campaign.
But Ramsey has started the season in stunning form, scoring 15 goals for club and country and driving an Arsenal midfield including players of the calibre of Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta.
Coleman said: "When you see what he is doing at the minute then why would you not say he is at a similar level (to Bale)?
"What he's doing at the minute is enjoying his football. He's found his confidence again. He's always had the ability, he just needed to get the confidence back and he's got that.
"You can't be doing what he is doing without that. And he's doing it in every game. If he's not scoring, he looks like scoring. He's involved in everything. Rambo looks brilliant at the minute."
Coleman also admitted Bale had proved him wrong by already settling into his best form in Spain despite not having a pre-season.
But Coleman also felt some of the criticism that came Bale's way early in his time at the Bernabeu would not necessarily have been aimed at a player from a bigger country.
"He's proved everyone wrong again, including me. I just thought any normal player who misses pre-season then it would take six months to get back and find your rhythm," he said.
"A month ago after El Clasico he was getting criticised. Now a month on with more games we are seeing his ability.
"He is proving he is a world-class player. If he was English or Spanish and producing those performances and then getting the move, I don't think much would have been said.
"But, because he's Welsh and from a small footballing country, people have gone, 'Is he worth it?'
"Is anyone worth that money at the end of the day? But that is what someone has paid. It's not Gareth's fault.
"But if we look at players all around the world and see what they can and can't do, there's not many that can do what Gareth does when he is at his best and he's finding that again.
"He's playing regularly and he looks fantastic."
Story Highlights Six in 10 say third party needed for adequate representation
Current figure matches high from 2013
Seventy-eight percent of independents say third party needed
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- A majority of Americans, 60%, say a third major political party is needed because the Republican and Democratic parties "do such a poor job" of representing the American people. This matches the high set in 2013. Since 2007, a majority of Americans have generally called for a third party, with the exception of the last two presidential election years.
These latest results come as both the Democratic and Republican parties are experiencing formidable challenges in the 2016 presidential race from unlikely corners of their ranks, including several candidates who have never been elected to a political office. On the Democratic side, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has drawn a large following from left-leaning Americans. In the Republican nomination contest, real estate mogul Donald Trump has rocked his GOP competitors with personal attacks and unconventional political statements, and Dr. Ben Carson and former business executive Carly Fiorina are now among the front-runners for their party's nomination. None of these candidates has said they will seek a third-party bid for the presidency if they don't receive the nomination, but their popularity supports the idea that Americans may be willing to consider candidates outside of the pool of typical politicians.
Americans have been warm to the idea of a third party for at least a decade. When Gallup first asked whether a third party is needed in 2003, four in 10 Americans said it was. The figure climbed in subsequent polls, reaching a majority of 58% in 2007. With the exception of presidential election years in 2008 and 2012, majorities of 52% to 60% of Americans have said a third party is needed to address the inadequacies of the Republican and Democratic parties.
Meanwhile, 38% of Americans in the Sept. 9-13 Governance poll say the two major parties do an adequate job -- up from a low of 26% in 2013. However, this is markedly down from 2003, when more than half of Americans (56%) said the two major parties were representing the public adequately. Underscoring this dissatisfaction, less than 40% of Americans said they had a favorable view of either party earlier this year.
Nearly Four in Five Independents Say Third Party Needed
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Americans who identify politically as independents have consistently been most likely to say a third party is necessary. Majorities of independents in every poll since 2003 have had this view, ranging from a low of 56% in 2003 to a high of 78% in the latest poll.
Republicans and Democrats have, for the most part, been about equally likely to voice a preference for a third party, with the percentage in favor of a third party for each group usually less than a majority and well below the percentage of independents.
There have been a few times in the past when one party's supporters were more likely than the other's to believe a third party was necessary. In polls from 2003 to 2007, during Republican George W. Bush's presidency, Democrats were far more likely than Republicans to say a new major party needed to emerge, but the differences between the two groups settled thereafter. In 2011, however, on the heels of the rise of the Tea Party movement, Republicans were 11 percentage points more likely than Democrats to see a third party as necessary.
Bottom Line
Arguably, the U.S. political climate has been ripe for the emergence of a major third party for some time, but that hasn't yet happened.
So far during this election cycle, Americans may be instead expressing their frustration with the parties by supporting candidates such as Sanders, Trump, Carson and Fiorina. The lack of major third party candidates in recent years in part reflects the difficulty such candidates have in obtaining ballot access in the 50 states, securing a place in the debates and raising sufficient funds outside of the traditional two-party system. Businessman Ross Perot, however, had the personal resources to mount an independent campaign in 1992, and ended up with nearly 19% of the popular vote. It is always possible that a similar type of candidate could emerge to tap into the underlying sentiment and become a force with which the two major parties would have to contend.

Last weekend, Will Brooks was on the wrong end of an unfortunate situation when his opponent Alex Oliveira missed weight by five and a half pounds for their co-main event at UFC Fight Night 96. Brooks accepted the fight anyway and proceeded to lose in part due to a fracturing a rib in the first round. Then after the fight was stopped, Oliveira taunted Brooks as he was on the ground.
Oliveira's actions were not been well-received by many, least of all Brooks who recently went on the 5ive Rounds podcast with Brett Okamoto to discuss the entire situation, fighting Oliveira despite the weight issues, and his belief that Oliveira missed weight intentionally.
"I think those guys are scumbags. I think they're unprofessional and I think they're cheaters. In my opinion, at the end of the day, I think they purposely missed weight. I think they did that on purpose. I think they were looking for an advantage.
"For you to miss weight by five, almost six pounds -- that's something different. In my opinion, you didn't even try. You're looking for an advantage. And then during the weigh-ins and you're doing all this stuff, you guys aren't acting professional like you really wanted to make the weight. They were in the back dancing and laughing and doing all this other stuff, acting like everything was cool, which I guess everything was cool. They accomplished their goal and got their advantage."
After Oliveira's substantial miss, Brooks was under no obligation to accept the fight but did so because he felt compelled to earn both his show money and his win bonus, as well as the 20% of Oliveira's purse he received.
"I didn't know if I was going to get my win bonus. In my mind, I didn't know if I was going to walk out with just my show money, and I can't do that. If I have an opportunity to make both and not have to fight, I'll do that. I wasn't educated on the process. I was under the assumption that if I didn't take the fight -- and this was just me being uneducated on it -- you only get your show money. I've got to get out there and get both of my paychecks, that's how I approached it."
While the UFC could potentially have only paid Brooks his show money, the organization has shown a penchant for doing the right thing in situations like this, most recently paying Ian McCall his show money and his win money along with his Reebok sponsorship money for his failed attempt at a fight with Justin Scoggins at UFC 201 when Scoggins was seven pounds over the 125 lb. limit. In accepting the fight with Oliveira, Brooks made an extra $4,800 from the 20% of Oliveira's purse, but lost out on his $53,000 win bonus. The loss also resulted in Brooks dropping from the top 15 of the lightweight rankings.
While the size advantage likely played some factor, Brooks is more inclined to put the loss off on re-aggravating an old injury, saying that he felt he was having a lot of success despite giving up some weight.
"Honestly, I felt he was a little bigger and stronger but as the fight went on, I was able to take him down and pick him up and dump him. I felt I had plenty of control in the fight, honestly. I'm not trying to make excuses, it is what it is, but if I didn't have that injury ... I had fought through a rib injury in a previous fight but this time it was different. It stretched all the way to my back and spine. It felt like someone dropped a truck on my chest. I had a difficult time breathing."
The animosity that arose after the fight is particularly interesting because Oliveira has trained some at Brooks' home gym, American Top Team in Coconut Creek, Florida and has said he intends to continue training there. Brooks has other ideas though, in part because he intends to see Oliveira again down the road.
"I hold grudges when it comes to things like that. If they think they're going to come into ATT, you know, they'll have a fucking problem with me. Excuse my language but I'm not gonna sit around and let those guys be in my building. I've earned that time. These guys come and go. I'm a guy that has earned that opportunity to be here at all times.
"I'm not gonna sit here and be like, 'Oh, it's OK for you to disrespect me, come into a building where I've earned my space.' So, yeah, in the gym, if they're allowed to be here, am I going to associate with them? No. Am I going to look for another opportunity to compete against them? I'm definitely going to take that opportunity and I'm going to make him bleed. I'm going to hurt him."
Will Brooks lost to Alex Oliveira by TKO in the third round at UFC Fight Night 96. It was Brooks' first loss in the UFC and only his second career defeat. There is no timetable for his return.

Going to the Senior Bowl every year is a great experience. You get to see the players practice. You get to be around them and see some of their personalities. You also get to be around NFL people…coaches, scouts and media types. There really is a lot to take in.
I can't share every nugget I get down there. I'll offer hints as best I can, but some stories I'm just not allowed to outright share. With that in mind…
I came away feeling better about Doug Pederson. He's overly positive in his press conferences, but that's a public face. He's realistic about who can play and who can't.
The Eagles key free agent is DT Bennie Logan. Nobody has a good feel for his future. The Eagles obviously want him back, but can they afford him? I have seen a few free agent lists compiled by smart media types and Bennie hasn't been a Top 40 free agent on them. Maybe that means he will have a realistic price tag and the Eagles can keep him. You don't want to develop good young talent and let those guys walk if you can help it.
There is no consensus on whether Alshon Jeffrey will hit free agency or whether the Eagles will pursue him. Really good player, but he's got a couple of issues and you wonder if he's worth elite money.
Non-Eagles people think highly of Carson Wentz. He's got issues to work through, but they love his potential and see him as a franchise QB.
It isn't lost on people that the Eagles went 5-1 with Lane Johnson, who was the team's best OL when he played. Having him for a full season will make a big difference.
You can have a depressing debate on who was worse down the stretch, Leodis McKelvin or Nolan Carroll.
The Eagles must figure out slot corner. Malcolm Jenkins needs to stay back at Safety the whole year. Who knew losing Ron Brooks would hurt the defense?
The feeling is that DeSean Jackson won't get big money as a free agent. Whether that could cause the Eagles to go after him is still unknown.
Dalvin Cook would be a great fit in the Eagles offense, but there are on and off-field concerns with him that could hurt his value.
No one has a clue what the Eagles are going to do for a #3 QB. They could draft one, but this is a weak QB class.
The feeling is that Wiz won't be returning to the Eagles.
The Eagles need to find 2 starting WRs. You just can't count on Nelson Agholor or DGB to play substantially better in 2017.

Scott McCloughan, the Skins GM, sat in the stand near me and Jimmy Bama on Thursday. Most coaches and GMs go to the other side, which is only for NFL people. McCloughan is a different kind of guy. He struck up a conversation with a family in front of him. That happened to be the parents of WR Trent Taylor. McCloughan was just trying to be a nice guy.
Later a middle school football team came and sat in the stands. They walked in front of us. McCloughan said hello to the kids and was just trying to be friendly. It was cool to see an NFL executive just being a normal guy.

There was a lot of talk about how the coaches ran the practices. I wasn't a huge fan of the CLE staff, but the Bears were far worse. Chip Kelly would have had a heart attack if he watched all the wasted time by that staff. Terrible.
I spent more time watching CBs and WRs than ever before. That meant less time on OL, DL, RB and LB.

The Permian basin is starting to see decline rates from shale wells accelerate, a trend that could be the result of too much drilling.
Shale wells suffer from steep decline rates. A rush of output occurs at first, but almost immediately after the well comes online, the flow rate drops off precipitously. And within just a few months the well is a shadow of its former self. That is typical.
But putting a bunch of wells close to each other can induce even steeper decline rates than normal because they can rob pressure from each other. If that occurs, the wells can suffer irreparable damage, and ultimately, the volume of oil and gas that can eventually be recovered could potentially be permanently diminished.
Such a scenario appears to be playing out in the U.S. shale patch, with the white-hot Permian, in particular, falling victim to what is a byproduct of such a massive boom in activity. Bloomberg reports that the decline rate from “legacy” wells – those already online – is accelerating rapidly, the consequence of over-drilling in certain areas.
In fact, the legacy decline rate in the Permian has accelerated from around 100,000 bpd month-on-month in 2015 and 2016, to a month-on-month decline of 154,000 bpd most recently. In other words, the Permian will see legacy wells lose 154,000 bpd from July to August, which means that shale drillers will have to drill at least as much just to stay flat. The EIA projects that the industry will add 218,000 bpd of new gross supply in the Permian in August, leading to a net gain of 64,000 bpd.

Other shale basins are seeing their decline rates rise as well. The Eagle Ford's legacy decline rate has jumped from 80,000 bpd a few months ago to 136,000 bpd in August.
Of course, legacy decline rates always increase when more shale wells come online. It's just a numbers game. More wells in production means that there are more wells that will enter into decline. In that sense, the higher rates overall decline in the U.S. shale patch are predictable and understandable.
But a new report from Horseman Capital Management Ltd., and cited by Bloomberg, says the decline rates are deeper than usual because drillers are placing too many wells in close proximity to one another. The wells then kill pressure in each other, lowering the amount of oil that can be recovered from them. "New well production is increasingly cannibalizing legacy production," Russell Clark, investment manager at Horseman Capital Management, wrote in a new report, cited by Bloomberg. "The decline rate looks to be accelerating."
Shale companies often trumpet their ability to tweak their drilling practices in order to cut costs, boasting about “drilling efficiencies” that have allowed them to lower their breakeven prices over the last three years. But one of those practices is putting so many wells close together, a practice that was thought to squeeze more oil out of the ground at lower cost. However, while the costs might indeed remain low, this new evidence suggests that cramming wells close too close together could be eating into their own potential production levels.

More evidence of trouble in the Permian came from the quarterly data from Pioneer Natural Resources, considered one of the top drillers in the Permian. Pioneer reported higher natural gas-to-oil ratios in its production than it expected. As oil fields age, Reuters reports, they tend to produce relatively more gas than oil. Pioneer's surprise at the higher gas coming from its wells raised some alarm from investors, who questioned company executives on a conference call about falling well pressure. Pioneer's management tried to assuage investors by saying that the higher gas-to-oil ratio has more to do with simply more gas coming out of the ground, rather than less oil. In other words, they say, there's nothing to see here.
Perhaps. But the legacy decline rates are accelerating at a dizzying pace. Across the top shale basins in the country, including the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, Haynesville, Marcelles, Niobrara and Utica shales, the oil legacy decline rate has hit 350,000 bpd. Again, that means, from July to August, those basins lost 350,000 bpd of production. Of course, the rate of drilling is so aggressive that the industry still added 113,000 bpd of production on net, but it took a lot of new wells to more than offset the decline.
Shale output is still on an upward trend, but if the industry can't keep up on this accelerating treadmill, the legacy decline rates will catch up to them.

More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:
Nick Clegg's promises of more powers for Scotland if it votes no in the independence referendum have been crushed by the abject failure of the Liberal Democrats in the European elections.
Wiped out in Scotland and with only one MEP left in England, the Liberal Democrats have been replaced as the third party of UK politics by UKIP. Even this description is to be kind to them, as they actually finished in sixth place by number of MEPs, behind the Greens and even behind the SNP, who only contested the Scottish seats.
It now looks increasingly possible that UKIP will replace the LibDems as the Conservative party's coalition partner at Westminster after the next UK general election.
Clegg said he and his party would be the guarantor of more powers for Scotland, but he has no power, no influence and, as this video from 2010 shows, no track record of keeping what he holds out as heartfelt promises. Everyone knows about tuition fees, but listen to what he also says about votes for 16 year olds, which the LibDems held out against in the Scottish parliament over the referendum.
Given that the Liberals have been promising home rule for over 100 years, Nick Clegg is the worst possible guarantor of last resort on more powers!
So can we expect support for more powers from UKIP once they hold the balance of power in the UK? In their 2011 Scottish Manifesto they said that:
The Scottish Parliament would remain in Edinburgh, but MSPs would be eradicated in favour of Scottish Westminster MPs.
This essentially means closing the Scottish Parliament and having a Scottish Grand committee travel from London for a week a month to impose Westminster's point of view on Scotland. Now I see why he is laughing!
NOTE: UKIP lost their deposit in every seat they fought in 2011 in Scotland.
As we have pointed out before on Business for Scotland only a YES vote guarantees more powers.
Conclusion
Business for Scotland has always made it clear that we support independence and democratic self governance as a means to an end and that end is to build a better, more prosperous, more confident and fairer nation than the one we are limited to as part of the restrictive partnership that is the UK. For us, the party that runs Scotland is of little importance so long as they are elected only by the people of Scotland, focused on the needs of the people of Scotland and not beholden to the needs of the overblown and politically, socially and culturally different mass population of London and the South East.
That said we have serious concerns about the fact that UKIP are now setting the political agenda in the rest of the UK and will have a major role to play in representing Scotland's agricultural and fishing industries in the EU. Given UKIP's rise in popularity there is now a great deal more uncertainty around the UK's continued membership of the UK than with Scotland's membership as an independent country. Scotland wants to stay in the EU, and it is now clear that to win the next election Labour and the conservatives will both have to firm up their anti EU credentials and commit to an in/out referendum. This means that if Scotland votes No in September we are increasingly likely to be ripped out of the EU after 2015 by the rest of the UK's growing admiration for UKIP.
Voting YES gives more certainty on Scotland continuing in the EU than voting NO.

The concrete funneled out of the mixer and into the 18-foot pit, slowly undulating across the reinforcing steel girders. Two hundred trucks would converge on the site, making more than 2,100 trips to and from eight different concrete plants. After nearly 19 hours, 21,200 cubic yards of concrete would fill the pit, making it the largest continuous concrete pour in history, certified by the Guinness Book of World Records.
The pour, completed three weeks ago, provided the foundation for the 73-story Wilshire Grand, a $1 billion hotel, retail and office project in downtown Los Angeles, scheduled to be the tallest building west of the Mississippi when it opens in 2017. And the Wilshire Grand is among a gaggle of projects, 97 in all according to Los Angeles Downtown News, put into development in the rapidly reinventing neighborhood just in the past five months. Overall, 5,000 market-rate housing units will come online in the next two years, joining a boom in office space, museums, restaurants and brand-name shopping. Downtown L.A., left for dead amid the open spaces of Southern California, is back.
Story Continued Below
The renaissance has taken many forms, including the culture clash between the new urban hipsters and the long-forgotten homeless we chronicle elsewhere in this series. Perhaps most consequential may well be the least tangible shift the downtown boom portends: Is it, at long last, changing the car culture of a city long defined by freeways and congestion?
Certainly, the combination of multiple new mass transit spokes and development around transit stations in recent years has brought the fantasy of movies like Spike Jonze's Her—living comfortably in L.A. without a car—closer to reality. But the utopia of Her, with its luxurious rail cars, ubiquitous skyscrapers and crisscrossing footbridges, depicts a smoothly connected urban landscape without explaining where the rest of the city went. In a city made up of people and not just trains and high-rises, city planners have a challenge: how to make sure the benefits of trendy “New Urbanist” ideas reach everyone.
Right now, there's definitely a target for all this downtown development: young people clamoring for a lifestyle that doesn't involve driving 10 miles just to get a soda. “People have been going to New York, Chicago and seeing these great urban cities,” says Brigham Yen, a realtor, downtown evangelist and writer of the blog DTLA Rising. “They come back to Los Angeles in search of that same type of environment.”
The Politics of Downtown L.A.'s Comeback Impressive as downtown Los Angeles' renaissance has been, L.A. will never be a city defined by its central core. Sure, there are more than 50,000 people now living in what was once a deserted downtown. But that number's dwarfed by the 4 million spread out across the rest of our 503 square miles. That old joke that L.A. is “72 suburbs in search of a city?” It's still true. Politically, we're all over the map, too. Each of L.A.'s 15 city council members oversees many distinct neighborhoods. The San Fernando Valley doesn't want or need what South L.A. does; the South Bay has entirely different priorities from Hollywood, Silver Lake or the Westside. And yet politics, inevitably, played an important role in L.A.'s reinvention, with council members whose districts cover parts downtown helping to create the boom there, beginning with two transformative events in 1999. The first was the opening of the Staples Center, a 20,000-seat sports and concert arena, home to the NBA's Lakers and Clippers and the NFL's Kings. Staples was built for $375 million by the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), a developer well connected at City Hall. Councilman Joel Wachs, a popular opponent of any public subsidies to private projects, objected to AEG's demand for a tax break on parking fees to help finance construction. And AEG lost an important ally when Mayor Richard Riordan recused himself from negotiations to avoid an apparent conflict of interest because he owned the nearby Pantry Restaurant. L.A.'s Roman Catholic archbishop, Cardinal Roger Mahony—then at the height of his power—stepped into the negotiations. Mahony wanted to build a new cathedral to replace the small, rundown St. Vibiana's in the heart of downtown. Concerns were raised about the preservation of the old cathedral and gentrification around the new one, but Mahony argued that improving downtown was a worthy goal. He got AEG to promise to hire and train local workers, and allowed that St. Vibiana's would get enough repairs to keep it standing, even as it ceased to be the headquarters for the archdiocese. Mahony's clout, and full support from influential Council President John Ferraro, finally helped to overcome Wachs's objection. The economic impact was almost immediate. After opening in 1999, the next year Staples hosted the Democratic National Convention and the Lakers' first national championship in 12 years. “It brought people to downtown who hadn't been here for years,” says Carol Schatz, president of the Central City Association of Los Angeles, a downtown business organization. Many other large-scale developments have followed, including Mahony's massive Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall. And when AEG proposed L.A. Live—a $2.5 billion complex with three music venues, a 54-story hotel and a condo tower—it sailed through the council, thanks to the success of Staples Center. The second transformative event of 1999 was less dramatic but just as important. The freeways that emptied out downtown had become so congested that trips to and from the suburbs were exercises in gridlock and road rage. As a result, people who worked downtown actually began to think about living there. The Central City Association, which wanted downtown transformed, and historic preservationists, who wanted it saved, together pushed the adaptive reuse ordinance, which expedited the approval process for renovating old buildings. Developers began turning decaying commercial and office buildings into apartments and condos. It worked, and as demand increased, there was a boom in new residential construction too. Does all this mean downtown will become the heartbeat of Los Angeles and give us a coherent political identity? That's impossible to imagine. Those 15 council members will still attend to diverse local interests, while downtown remains a boutique cityscape in the midst of our continuing suburban experiment. The essence of Los Angeles will always be sprawl. Warren Olney is host and executive producer of “Which Way, L.A.?” and “To The Point” on Santa Monica, Calif.'s KCRW , one of the nation's leading NPR affiliates.
The gentrification of city centers in America is by now an old story. But despite L.A.'s obsession with the cutting edge, downtown fell far behind the trend, like a past-his-prime actor reduced to straight-to-Netflix thrillers, perhaps because of that car culture that was once so cutting edge in its time. Downtown was once home to some of the greatest movie palaces of the last century, wedged among dozens of impressive Beaux Arts and Art Deco structures. But as suburbs exploded and the freeways took over (believe it or not, Who Framed Roger Rabbit tells this story best), the neighborhood languished. The last high-rise project in the historic core before the recent spate of development went up in 1961.
Boosters have predicted downtown's comeback since the 1990s, but the return was gradual. Over time, the tolerance for more and more frontier subdivisions, stretching as far as 80 miles from the city, finally ran out. “Los Angeles was and still is the poster child of sprawl gone wrong,” says Brigham Yen. “The sprawl has hit the wall.”
Rethinking the downsides of sprawl coincided with a 2008 ballot measure called Measure R, which dedicated a half-cent sales tax for mass transit projects for 30 years. City leaders, hounded by demands to contain the city's legendary traffic, envisioned a return to the way Angelenos got around before mass production of the automobile, when the city was laid out to facilitate streetcar lines. Three rail projects are currently under construction, including the first transit line to LAX Airport along Crenshaw Boulevard, and an expanded Expo Line that, upon completion, will go from downtown to the beach city of Santa Monica. These rail lines finally serve the biggest population centers in the city, ending decades when real public transit was simply not an option.
Now it's all the rage. In just 20 years, the Metro Rail system has built six transit lines that feed into downtown—that's as many lines as serve downtown Chicago. DASH bus service connects from the rail stations to neighborhood locations. And the city just secured a $700 million grant from Washington to create a regional connector to bring train lines together for seamless transfers. But money alone cannot ensure success, notes Ethan Elkind, the author of Railtown, a history of Los Angeles's troubled transit past. “Despite the multibillion-dollar investment, it took specific policies to make development happen,” Elkind says. “You can't just build the line and assume people will come.”
In 1999, for example, the city passed an “ adaptive reuse” ordinance for downtown, which allowed non-residential buildings to be rezoned for condos and apartments. It also freed developers from onerous parking and zoning requirements that could have derailed projects from the beginning. Adaptive reuse has flourished downtown, with several commercial and industrial spaces refashioned into lofts, a signature Ace Hotel recently opened in the former United Artists Building and even the iconic Library Tower considering a residential/hotel conversion.
This year from Alaska to California rivers and streams on the Pacific Coast of North America are counting record breaking numbers of salmon. Here's a collection of news clipping reporting on the fact that the fish have returned. Naturally scientists are looking for something unusual that might have happened in the open ocean salmon territory that could account for the hundreds of millions of extra fish. The only event that can be found is the spectacular plankton bloom that resulted from our ocean pasture restoration project last summer. When the volcano of 2008 brought back an extra 40 million sockeye salmon to the Fraser River in 2010 I wrote the the song 40 Million Salmon Can't Be Wrong. It is pure joy this year following our efforts to improve on the volcanic bloom of 2008 to hear a new cohort of salmon singing. For some context in 2012 the Alaska catch was 124 million fish, 2011 it was 176 million fish, in 2010 = 175 million, in 2009 = 162 million and in 2008 = 146 million fish.
Pink salmon reaching Fraser River in massive numbers
Published Thursday, Sep. 12 2013, 8:14 PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Sep. 12 2013, 8:14 PM EDT MARK HUME VANCOUVER — The Globe and Mail
Last month, there were so few sockeye salmon in the Fraser River that all fishing was banned. But this week, with wave after wave of pink salmon arriving, the fishery was opened and processing plants were quickly overwhelmed by the huge numbers of salmon coming in. The massive return of one species – pinks – coming on the heels of a disastrous run of another – sockeye – may be linked to a dramatic shift in ocean conditions last year. And it has raised questions about the possible role of a controversial experiment that took place when the Haida Salmon Restoration Corp. dumped iron material in the ocean last summer, stimulating plankton growth just as the pink salmon were moving through the area.

VICTORIA—The unprecedented overdose death toll in British Columbia means it may be time to have a “courageous conversation” about decriminalizing the drugs that are killing so many people, says the province's minister of addictions. While decriminalizing drugs is a federal matter, Judy Darcy said Thursday the province is doing everything it can to stem the number of deaths.
Ninety per cent of the deaths happened indoors, half of those in private homes. ( THE ASSOCIATED PRESS )
“I think the fundamental issue here is we need to start treating addiction like a health issue,” she said, adding many people living with addictions are homeless or living in poverty. “We need to be pouring on the supports so that we have a pathway to hope for people and so they don't end up in the criminal justice system.” Read more:

In most cases, the powerful opioid painkiller was combined with other drugs, including cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Darcy said removing the threat of being arrested for those who are caught using the drugs could be helpful.

“I think we should be prepared as a country to have a courageous conversation about it. In the meantime we are pushing the envelope and we are being bold and innovative in doing everything we can within the context of the present federal framework.” Health Canada said in an email statement that the federal government is not considering decriminalizing or legalizing all drugs. “The Government of Canada is committed to a comprehensive, collaborative, compassionate and evidence-based approach to drug policy, which uses a public health approach when considering and addressing drug issues,” the statement said. The statement said harm reduction has been restored as a core pillar of Canada's drug policy, along with prevention, treatment and enforcement. Safe consumption sites have opened around the province for addicts and the coroner's service said there have been no deaths at them. Ninety per cent of the deaths happened indoors, half of those in private homes. Darcy said her ministry is working to counter the factors that lead to most of the deaths. “We are also ramping up .... a major anti-stigma campaign and a major campaign to reach out to people who are using alone because nine out of 10 people who are dying are using at home alone. That's about overcoming stigma, that's about everybody in a family, in a community, friends reaching out and having conversations with people and reducing the stigma.” Three-quarters of those who died are between the ages of 30 and 59, and four out of five of them are male. The Fraser Health Authority, which covers Metro Vancouver neighbourhoods from Burnaby to Hope on the east side of the Fraser Valley, had the most deaths this year at 295, followed by Vancouver at 269. In 2012, fentanyl was detected in just four per cent of overdose deaths. Darcy said the government is looking at enlarging a program used at overdose prevention sites in Vancouver where people can check their illicit drugs for fentanyl. “But we plan to do everything we can include expanding drug checking to keep people safe from these poisoned drug supplies on the street.”

Sporting Club and the U.S. Soccer Federation announced on Friday that the two organizations have agreed to a memorandum of understanding to jointly explore bringing a new National Training and Coaching Development Center to Kansas City, Kan. Together they are studying a proposed project that would be designed to develop a world-class soccer training facility and serve as the premier destination in the United States for player, coaching and referee innovation.
The three initiatives of the National Training and Coaching Development Center would be world-class infrastructure, education and youth development. The mission is to vertically integrate a system of physiological, technical, scientific, psychological and information-driven development for players, coaches and referees of all ages.
There are more than 20,000 licensed soccer coaches in the United States and nearly 150,000 soccer officials across the country. U.S. Soccer, which is celebrating its 100 Year Anniversary today, is committed to providing education resources and courses to foster consistent and quality instruction.
The state-of-the-art campus would be designed, developed and operated as a world-class training facility dedicated to the future of American soccer. At a projected cost of $50 million, the National Training and Coaching Development Center would host U.S. National Team camps, coaching education and referee development programming.
U.S. Soccer will also explore the feasibility of establishing futsal and/or small-sided soccer programming to be managed out of the National Training and Coaching Development Center.
The first step in the realization of the National Training and Coaching Development Center is to identify a site. By Monday, Sporting Club will issue a Request for Proposals to Wyandotte County landowners and real estate brokers in an effort to help identify the best available location for the National Training and Coaching Development Center.
QUOTES
Joe Reardon - Mayor/CEO of Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan.
“A national development center is a grand opportunity for us to build upon the great synergy and excitement we've experienced since the opening of Sporting Park. The partnership with U.S. Soccer and Sporting Club would help support our efforts to bring quality youth soccer programs across all of Kansas City, Kansas and further enhance our reputation as a city with world-class sports facilities. We have been diligently working with Sporting Club as they developed this revolutionary concept, and with this announcement, it looks to be well worth the wait. We look forward to hearing more details about the impacts in the coming days and weeks.”
Todd LaSala, Chairman of the Board, Kansas City Kansas Chamber of Commerce
"We welcome U.S. Soccer to Kansas City, Kansas with open arms. It makes perfect sense to have the National Training and Coaching Development Center locate in KCK, which is now home to one of the world's best new soccer-specific stadiums and a growing community of rabid professional soccer fans. The KCK Chamber will be actively looking for opportunities to help U.S. Soccer succeed in this market and to leverage the obvious synergies and economic development benefits that will result from having these world-class facilities in our city."
Robb Heineman - Sporting Club CEO
“While it is certainly a great honor that the Federation is considering Kansas City, it is also a great recognition of the community's support of soccer. The National Training and Coaching Development Center would bring tens of thousands of hotel room nights and the futsal component has the potential to have a significant, long-term impact on youth development in our sport. We saw Matt Besler become the first player born in Kansas to play for the U.S. Men's National Team earlier this year. We hope to see more players represent Kansas City in the future. This project has both immediate, ongoing economic benefits and the potential for an incredible long-term benefit. The development center would place Kansas City at the center of soccer conversation, both nationally and worldwide.”
THE most expensive Holden ever sold is back on the market.
The Monaro HRT 427 is listed on eBay for $1 million with so far one bid of $900,000, Carsguide.com.au reports.
The price, if accepted after bids close tomorrow at 8.42pm, would be the highest for a car sold in Australia under the hammer.
Owner Paul Rammers of Cam Plastics at Narangba, north of Brisbane, said he was still in two minds about selling the car.
"I don't need to sell it but it's time to move on a bit," he said.
The car, one of only two roadgoing Monaro HRT 427s built, was once owned by collector Shawn "Chooka" Ryan of Cairns who paid $920,000 for the car before he was forced to resell it in 2010.

George Tereshkovich boarded the SS Rotterdam with late wife, June. This is a photograph of one of the many dinners the couple enjoyed during their 102-day cruise.
Perhaps, the lucky numbers of his stateroom – 711 – inspired his experiment.
Leaving Honolulu far behind on the way to French Polynesia sometime after the equatorial crossing ceremonies aboard Holland-America's grand ocean liner, SS Rotterdam, George Tereshkovich sat down at the writing desk.
The retired Texas Tech plant and soil science professor dated his missive Feb. 19, 1997, and addressed it to an anonymous recipient who might find it and promised him or her a kingly $5. When finished, he placed that letter and his business card in an empty water bottle, screwed on the cap and walked out onto the aft deck.
As the sun set and the screws churned a white froth below him, Tereshkovich tossed his message into the vast blue ocean spreading out before him.
“I told the wife what I was going to do,” the 81-year-old said. “She thought I was seasick or something, throwing a note overboard. We continued cruising, and I completely forgot about it.”
Fourteen years later, his message in a bottle would turn up more than 6,000 miles away (a quarter of the Earth's circumference) in the dunes of the beaches of Southwestern Australia's Big Quaram Beach.
Little did he know he'd wind up owing someone that $5.
Cruise of a Lifetime
On Aug. 31, 1995, Tereshkovich's 27-year career came to an end at Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. To celebrate, he and his wife decided to book a 102-day world cruise in 1997 aboard Rotterdam.
The ship, known as the “Grande Dame,” was one of the world's most successful cruise liners. The fifth liner to carry the name, she was launched by Holland's Queen Juliana in a gala ceremony on Sept. 13, 1958. The Rotterdam was the last great Dutch ship of state, and was making her final trip around the globe before she would be retired in 2000.
Tereschkovich and his wife, lifelong cruisers, left from San Diego to go around the world and disembark in Ft. Lauderdale 102 days later. Right after crossing the equator, the idea for the experiment hit him.
“I remember I wrote February 1997, and I told them I was on a world cruise with my wife,” he said. “I said ‘to the finder of this note, I will award them $5 if they send me the message back.' But I wondered, ‘What address do I give to return my letter?' Well, I knew that Texas Tech University was always going to be here, so I used a Texas Tech address, put my business card in there and I threw it overboard.”
Flash Forward
No one knows for sure what route the message in the bottle took, but it was found more than 6,000 miles from the estimated point it was cast. (Click to enlarge.)
In late April 2011, Diane Chanut and her partner, Luke McLaren, vacationed at Big Quaram Beach in Southwestern Australia enjoying a week's worth of hiking on the Bibbulmun track.
Luke serves as a ranger with Parks & Wildlife Service Northern Territory at Ormiston Gorge Ranger Station – part of the West MacDonnell National Park in the Northern Territory, while Diane is a tour guide on the Larapinta Trail, also in the park.
The couple said they planned the vacation to get away from the dusty, dry climate of the continent's interior.
Because of the beach's remoteness, Chanut said the couple had just joked with each other about the chances of finding a message in a bottle. One of Chanut's friends is a kayaker in Papua, New Guinea, and she said he often throws messages in bottles out into the water.
“Little did we know,” Chanut said. “I caught sight of the bottle on a dune a bit out from the tide line, and Luke volunteered to go check it out. What was our surprise when, upon inspection, the said bottle did include some form of paper in it. We opened up the bottle to get the piece of paper out. It was very faded by the sun, but we managed to read it and also found the attached business card which was in very good condition. We celebrated the occasion by taking a picture as we knew we were going to follow up on this extraordinary find and strive to get in touch with the sender.”
The letter was difficult to read because of sun damage, but the Australian couple said the Texas Tech business card was in good condition. (Click to enlarge.)
Chanut said the letter read:
February 19, 1997
I am aboard the SS Rotterdam (Holland-America line) en route to Perth, Australia in the Great Australian Bight Sea. Should you find this note [undecipherable words] date and place you found the message.
Dr George Tereshkovich
Department of Plant & Soil Science
Texas Tech University
Lubbock, Texas [undecipherable numbers] USA
International Search
At first, Chanut said she wasn't sure she was going to answer the letter. She and McLaren did wonder for a short time if the letter could be a scam. But the condition of the bottle and the letter convinced the pair about its authenticity, and the two decided to follow up on contacting the writer.
“I obviously wasn't sure if we were going to get an answer or not, but I figured that if the person who dropped the bottle went through this exercise, they would probably be glad to get an answer and thus would probably get back to us,” Chanut said. “Also, the university address was a good place to make sure we would be able to track down the whereabouts of the sender in case he was no longer working there, so that was also upping our chances of hearing back from the mysterious sender.”
Chanut said she began googling Tereshkovich's name to find out more about who he was and whether she could track down a university email address for him. As she was unsuccessful, she decided to email the dean's office at the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources to ask how to get in touch with the retired professor.
Since the time he wrote the letter, Tereshkovich had moved to Austin, and never was a big believer in email. A secretary in the dean's office wrote back to Chanut saying that she would pass her note along to Tereshkovich to let him know his message in a bottle had been found.
Luke McLaren and his partner Diane Chanut found the message in a bottle on a dune out from the tide line of Southwestern Australia's Big Quaram Beach.
A few days later, Tereshkovich walked out to get his mail. He found a letter from Texas Tech in his box.
“I thought, ‘Here's the dean asking for more money,'” he said, joking. “I opened it up. When I read it, I was stunned someone found my bottle with the message.”
And the rest is history as they say, Chanut said.
“We were completely blown away when we received Dr. T's letter a few days after that,” Chanut said. “It was so heartfelt and so generous to us. He included some souvenirs from the U.S., such as postcards from his home in Lubbock, a couple of $2 notes and the ‘reward' he remembered promising in his letter ($5 plus inflation from 1997), so we could treat ourselves to a nice bottle of Barossa Valley wine next time we were in town. We could read the excitement in his words, and it was such a great story to tell around us as well.”
Tereshkovich said he plans to save up for a cruise to Australia and take an excursion to Alice Springs to meet the couple in the next two or three years.
“I don't know what my approach will be, but I'll keep it light,” he said. “We may sit down to a little Aussie beer, and I can find out who they are and tell them who I am. We can have some camaraderie there.”
Following former FBI Director Comey's testimony that President Obama's Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked him to downplay the Hillary Clinton email scandal, Senate Republicans are demanding hearings into her involvement in "obstructing justice."
As a reminder, Comey said Lynch instructed Comey not to call the criminal investigation into the Clinton server a criminal investigation. Instead, Lynch told Comey to call it a “matter,” Comey said, “which confused me.” Comey cited that pressure from Lynch to downplay the investigation as one of the reasons he held a press conference to recommend the Department of Justice not seek to indict Clinton.
Full Transcript...
LANKFORD: Then you made a comment earlier a attorney general, the previous attorney general asking you about the investigation on the Clinton e-mails saying you were asked to not call it an investigation anymore. But call it a matter. You said that confused you. You can give us additional details on that? COMEY: Well, it concerned me because we were at the point where we refused to confirm the existence as we typically do of an investigation for months. And was getting to a place where that looked silly because the campaigns we're talking about interacting with the FBI in the course of our work. The Clinton campaign at the time was using all kinds of euphemisms, security matters, things like that for what was going on. We were getting to a place where the attorney general and I were both going to testify and talk publicly about it I wanted to know was she going to authorize us to confirm we have an investigation. She said yes, don't call it that, call it a matter. I said why would I do that? She said, just call it a matter. You look back in hindsight, if I looked back and said this isn't a hill worth dying on so I just said the press is going to completely ignore it. That's what happened when I said we opened a matter. They all reported the FBI has an investigation open. So that concerned me because that language tracked the way the campaign was talking about the FBI's work and that's concerning. LANKFORD: You gave impression that the campaign was somehow using the language as the FBI because you were handed the campaign language? COMEY: I don't know whether it was intentional or not but it gave the impression that the attorney general was looking to align the way we talked about our work with the way it was describing that. It was inaccurate. We had an investigation open for the federal bureau of investigation, we had an investigation open at the time. That gave me a queasy feeling.
So who was obstructing or trying to interfere there?
Comey said that this troubled him greatly and convinced him, “I have to step away from the department if we're too close this case credibly.”
Well, as The Hill reports, Senate Republicans want to know...
Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), the No. 2 Senate Republican who is a member of both the Intelligence and Judiciary committees, said it “would be very helpful” for Lynch to testify before the Judiciary panel, which oversees the Justice Department. “Frankly, a lot of what Hillary Clinton was exposed to by Director Comey's misconduct and the way he handled that was apparently in response to his lack of confidence in the attorney general, and I think there is a lot we could learn from that,” Cornyn said. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also wants to hear from Lynch and is pushing for the Judiciary Committee to “get more involved.” “The accusations now that ... the current and former attorney general were political — that has nothing to do with Russia as much as it has to do with how the Department of Justice is being run,” he said. “I want to find out all about that.” A spokesman for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, stressed that no decisions have been made and staffers needed to first “gather evidence." But the spokesman said it was “likely” after Comey's remarks before the intelligence panel that Lynch's testimony before the Judiciary Committee “will become necessary at some point.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, signaled that the panel should look into whether Lynch tried to downplay the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email setup. “I think we need to know more about that. And there's a only way to know about it, and that's to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that,” she told CBS in a recent interview. A spokesman for Sen. Ted Cruz said the Texas Republican would “absolutely” support Lynch testifying.
Of course President Trump has had plenty to say (tweeting)...
“A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!”
one RNC talking point leaked to a Washington Post reporter this week.
"Why is no one investigating Attorney General Lynch's Department of Justice for obstruction of justice in the Clinton email investigation... There is compelling evidence to back up the claim that AG Lynch engaged in obstruction of justice."
Though GOP lawmakers have long been wary of Lynch, placing her back in the spotlight could backfire if it also keeps the public's focus on Comey amid continued fallout over the FBI chief's firing in early May.
Of course, we are sure that The Left will see this as nothing but misdirection from the various Russia probes - which are all backed by nothing but innuendo - and "obstruction of justice" enquiries - which are supported by nothing but Comey's testimony - and well it might be. However, in this case, the weight of evidence, circumstantial or not, is starting to get heavy against the holier-than-thou Lynch.
"Orange Is The New Black" season 3 will be returning to Netflix in Summer 2015. The filming of the TV series has reportedly started, and it is rumored that the first episode will be shown in June.
Currently, the first and second seasons are available for streaming, and fans can look forward to a third season that is full of twists and turns. Below are the five things to expect in the third season of "Orange Is The New Black" based on spoilers.
Alex to join Piper in prison
Piper's lover and fan favorite drug dealer Alex is promoted as a series regular, and will be back in prison after Piper makes that phone call. This hints that Alex and Piper's relationship will be in focus next season. Aside from Alex, a slew of new characters will join the cast for the show's third season.
Daya to give birth
In season 2, fans saw Daya pregnant with John Bennett's baby, which the latter used to kick out Pornstarche out of the Litchfield Penitentiary. Spoilers say that Daya's tummy will pop next season as it is speculated that the new season will start with a time jump.
Changes in prison
There will be a lot of changes in the prison next season. There will be new inmates coming in. Also, there is a reshuffle in the prison officers. It was seen that Fig stepped down from her role as assistant warden due to embezzlement charges. She was replaced by Joe Caputo, who will enact changes in the prison. Moreover, Pornstache will exit the show after he was transferred because of the scandal that he allegedly impregnated an inmate.
Polly and Larry's relationship
Larry and Polly got intimate last season and the two went into relationship after breaking up with their respective partners. Season 3 will explore deeper into their relationship and how they will make everything work.
Prisoners' faith will be explored
Author Piper Kerman from whose memoir the TV series was based said that season 3 will revolve more on the faith of the characters.
We recently hosted “Challenging the Science Publishing Status Quo”, an evening of talks and discussion with several distinguished speakers. Each guest speaker focused on one particular aspect of publishing and peer review.
We've recorded all the talks, and will be posting them one by one, starting today, and continuing throughout next week. The guest speaker video schedule is at the bottom of this post. In addition, we've uploaded the opening talk by Rebecca Lawrence today, and will publish Vitek Tracz's closing words next Friday (May 10) alongside the panel discussion.
Challenging the Science Publishing Status Quo
After a short introduction, Rebecca Lawrence, Publisher of F1000Research, presents a brief history of scientific publishing:
She introduces the five key issues that each speaker will address: publication delays, publication of non-standard studies, open data, transparent peer review, and the importance of open access.
Rebecca's slides are available via F1000Posters.
Rapid publication
The first issue – publication delays – is addressed by Lawrence Kane, Associate Professor of Immunology, Director of Immunology Graduate Program, University of Pittsburgh. He introduces himself as an avid user of and contributor to F1000Prime, and now an author in F1000Research.
You can find the slides for this presentation at F1000Posters.
He addresses the importance of rapid publication and describes how in some fields, for example immunology, the speed of publication of scientific findings has gone down over the years, even though, as Rebecca's talk (above) also mentioned, technological advances should have made it possible to publish much faster.
Kane refers to a blog post by Michael Nielsen (author of Reinventing Discovery) which lists the factors that led to our current system of peer review: increased specialisation of science, an increase in the number of papers, and new publishing technologies.
Next, Kane discusses the resistance to reform the peer review process, and points out that reviewers often don't merely assess a paper on its own merit, but try to determine whether it's a fit for the particular journal they are reviewing for. He calls this the “tyranny of the impact factor”.
“The problem here is that regardless of what happens during the peer review process, (…) the ultimate impact of a study is not really immediately apparent.”
Finally, he points out that publications like F1000Research can help overcome the resistance to change by combining speed of publication with peer review.
“One of the main advantages of this kind of model is the speed by which you can make your findings known. (…) This does not necessarily née dto be at the expense of quality. There still needs to be peer review.”
Video schedule
Of course there is much more to be said about publishing, peer review, open access and open data, and we have a full week of videos still to come:
Monday, May 6: Keith Flaherty – The benefits of publishing non-standard studies
Tuesday, May 7: Steven Hyman – The importance of open data publication
Wednesday, May 8: Sue Griffin – The benefits of open and transparent peer review
Thursday, May 9: Gary Borisy – The move towards open access by governments and funders
Friday, May 10: Discussion
Buy Photo Police believe this burned area on the southwest corner of Ninth Street and Valley View Road is where an explosion took place at 12:27 a.m. Friday. (Photo: Payton Randle / Argus Leader Media)Buy Photo
The late-night explosion that shook houses and woke residents in west Sioux Falls was the result of a pop bottle bomb.
Police found a burn area at the southwest corner of Ninth Street and Valley View Road at 7 a.m. Friday. The explosion was heard at 12:27 a.m.
The Sioux Falls Police Department received 17 calls about the explosion, and numerous officers throughout the city also reported hearing the sound, according to Sgt. Kevin Henkel. A majority of the calls came from the area of Ninth and Valley View, which is between Marion Road and Sertoma Road.
Sam Clemens, police spokesman, said an officer found remnants of a 2-liter pop bottle near the intersection and burn site. A pop bottle bomb is essentially some type of bottle full of different ingredients that cause the bottle to rupture.
Depending on the type of ingredients used, Clemens said it is possible to make a pop bottle bomb with an explosion large enough to shake houses in the surrounding area.
"Oh, we felt it," said Joy Hanscom who lives in her home at 6305 W. Ninth St. with her husband, Jim. The Hanscoms were in bed when the explosion woke them.
"I thought someone hit a train at first," Jim said. "It was so close and that was the only thing I thought could have made an impact like that."
The couple also thought it could have been from the quarry near the fairgrounds or a tanker truck from a business up the road. But none of those options made sense because the explosion was close enough to make their home shake.
The Hanscoms have lived in their home near Ninth and Valley View for 50 years.
"We've never had anything like this happen before," Joy said. "Especially not so close."
Clemens said there is no history of people injuring themselves from pop bottle bombs, but police typically see smaller versions of the one used Friday morning.
"There is a potential chance of injury," he said. "But there haven't been any reports."
Tips have come into police, but they are still investigating and working to figure out who might have caused it.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wants a re-instatement of the assault weapons ban after a terrorist killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
During an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Clinton called for a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban.
“We did have an assault weapons ban for ten years,” she said. “I think it should be reinstated.”
During an interview with the Today Show, she added, “Let's keep weapons of war off our streets like the one that was used in Orlando.”
Clinton criticized Florida's gun laws, blaming legislatures for not regulating assault weapons, 50 caliber rifles, or large capacity ammunition magazines. She also blamed Florida for not requiring a permit to purchase a gun, not requiring gun registration, and not requiring gun owners to be licensed to carry a shotgun or a rifle.
“We know the gunman used a weapon of war to shoot down at least 50 innocent Americans and, you know, we won't even be able to get the congress to prevent terrorists or people on the no-fly list from buying guns,” she said.
Clinton demanded more gun control to stop mass shootings, reminding viewers that the mass shooting in Orlando was the worst in American history.
“Yes, there is a right for law-abiding, responsible Americans to own guns and, yes, there are reasonable common sense measures to try to keep people safe from guns,” she said. “We have to figure out the best way to move forward on that. That's what I'm committed to doing.”
Clinton condemned gun rights groups after they “scared the heck out of voting officials” on gun control.
“We cannot fall into the trap set by the gun lobby that says if you can't stop every shooting and every incident, you should not try to stop any,” she said. “That is not how laws work. it's not common sense.”

Spending on construction in New York City is on track this year to surpass $32 billion for the first time in history, driven in large part by a residential building boom, according to a report released Thursday morning by an industry trade group.
The report, a three-year forecast produced by the New York Building Congress, projects that total spending will continue to rise to $35.3 billion in 2015 and $35.6 billion in 2016. This year is forecast to end at a record $32.9 billion in total development activity, a 17 increase from the previous peak in 2007, the report said.

But looks can be deceiving. The cost of building is also on the rise, meaning construction activity still remains well below those peak levels reached before the bubble popped and the recession took its toll. Adjusted for inflation, the Building Congress' projection for this year would actually come in at 17 percent below peak, while the 2015 projection would be 13 percent below.
What's more, New York's construction industry has still not recovered the number of jobs lost during the recession, remaining almost 10,000 positions short of the 2008 peak of 132,600. The report does not anticipate the industry will close that gap any time soon; the authors forecast total jobs reaching 127,300 by 2016. The number of jobs has been rising steadily but slowly since bottoming out in 2010 and '11.
None of that is to say builders aren't bullish about New York City's future, or that there is any sense of a new bubble. In large part, the report predicts upward trends will continue in major categories. That's driven, Building Congress president Richard Anderson says, by the improving economy, increases in foreign investment and work on some major projects in both the public and private sector. He says the city's “construction market has just about fully rebounded from its post-recession depths and is nearing boom territory once again.”
Take residential, particularly the top-end of the market, where there seems to be no stopping the proliferation of luxury condos. The profit margins are massive for most luxury developers and many have taken to sparing no expense. The Building Congress forecasts total residential spending to reach 10.9 billion by the end of the year—an increase of $4.1 billion from 2013. That would grow to $11.7 billion in 2015 and $12.4 billion in 2016
“By way of contrast, New York City managed to invest just $8.3 billion in the residential sector during the three-year, post-recession period of 2009 through 2011,” the report says. “Furthermore, the 2016 forecast of $12.4 billion represents a more than 400 percent increase from the post- recession low of $2.4 billion in 2010.”
Even if the construction of ultra-high-end units falls, Mayor Bill de Blasio's affordable housing plan is expected to encourage residential building in general. There are, of course, risks there as the city plans rezonings for 15 neighborhoods where residential developers will be required to include affordable units in their buildings. Pushing for too much affordable housing could discourage development in general, Anderson said.
“What's risky is to require developers to contribute more to affordable housing. The question is, how far you can go?” he said, noting it remains to be seen what the incentive will be to build in these yet-to-be identified neighborhoods. “And I think that's an open question. But you can understand, from our numbers, why the administration would want to do this. This is a market overwhelmingly focused on ultra luxury construction.”
Other sectors do not have the same sort of trajectory, though. Even non-residential, non-government development isn't as frothy as one might think. As colleges plot massive expansions, gigantic office towers sprout across Manhattan and hotels pop up on what seems like every block, that sector is actually forecast to produce $7.8 billion by the end of the year—a $200 million drop from 2013.
The lack of spending on sports and entertainment venues is a big reason; work on Yankee Stadium, Citi Field, the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden took place between 2006 and 2013. Indeed, while the Building Congress expects non-residential spending to climb again to $10.3 billion in 2015, it anticipates another drop in 2016 to $9.6 billion. It will remain far away from its enormous 2010 peak of more than $13 billion, which appears to have been an anomaly.
Public sector spending—far and away the biggest piece of the construction spending pie—never recovered from its 2008 peak and is not expected to do so by the end 2016. The report anticipates government investment in mass transit, public schools, roads, bridges and other infrastructure to increase from $13.4 billion in 2013 to $14.3 billion by the end of this year. But it will fall again, the report predicts, to $13.3 billion in 2015 and $13.6 billion in 2016.
The city remains the largest purchaser of construction services and, this year alone, will spend about $7.5 billion—53 percent of all government spending and almost a quarter of all construction spending. The government sector is the biggest area of concern, Anderson said.
“The public sector—government spending, mostly on infrastructure—is fragile. The MTA has a $32 billion capital program and only about half of it is funded,” he said, noting the city capital plan is always subject to politics. “While we've been encouraged by the level of government spending in recent years, there's nothing certain about infrastructure.”
Here's an overview of the report's recommendations:

Renault Trucks and Groupe Delanchy have launched a new zero-emission and 100 percent electric experimental truck to be used to deliver fresh produce across Lyon.
Renault Trucks and Groupe Delanchy have launched a new zero-emission and 100 percent electric experimental truck to be used to deliver fresh produce across Lyon.
The 13-tonne truck is equipped with a refrigeration unit along with a temperature-controlled box, both powered exclusively from the truck's battery pack, which according to Renault is a first-of-its-kind achievement.
The truck will make trips every day to deliver fresh produce and seafood from Group Delanchy's distribution hub in Corbas to Lyon, one of the France's largest covered food markets.
Although the Renault truck is an experimental endeavor, it will be used under real operating conditions to test its performance.
The choice of Lyon as the city for the initiative is not random as it constitutes the historic birthplace of Renault Trucks.
Joseph Delanchy, President of Groupe Delanchy, said: “This zero-emission truck is a first step towards new technologies that are evolving very rapidly. We will evolve with them, as we have always done”.
The electric truck is considered an ideal solution to fight air pollution in residential areas and to reduce congestion in the city centre.
Bruno Blin, President of Renault Trucks said: "The inclusion of this vehicle in Groupe Delanchy's logistics plan perfectly illustrates our vision for road freight transport, namely a high-performance diesel vehicle for long-distance transport and a zero-emission vehicle to cover the final kilometres”.
Earlier this September, Carlos Ghosn, CEO of the Renault Nissan Alliance, which now includes Mitsubishi, shared the alliance's plans to launch 12 new electric car models by 2022.
Under the name Alliance 2022, the three companies have come together to collaborate on several platforms, such as powertrains and next-generation electric, autonomous and connected technologies in order to accelerate progress.

No idea how we missed this, but here it goes: During last Sunday's broadcast of Fox & Friends, co-host Pete Hegseth tossed an axe to tease an upcoming segment on timbersports, missed the target, and hit a marching band percussionist standing in the distance.
West Point's legendary Hellcats marching band played throughout the show, in honor of Flag Day and the Army's 240th birthday. One of its lead drummers, Jeff Prosperie, performed adjacent to the caged section where Hegseth grabbed the axe and tossed it at a large wooden board for a segment tease.
The axe flew over the target by more than a few inches and hit someone off-camera, behind the board. Fox showed Hegseth grimacing, while bystanders cupped their mouths in shock. The cameras then cut to the marching band, playing out the tease with the drum solo, while Prosperie walked around in the background, visibly grabbing his right arm. We never actually see the axe hit the drummer (more on that later).
Watch the moment below, as it aired on Fox:
In the following segment, Prosperie appeared again on-camera — this time for a brief interview with Hegseth, explaining the origins and history of the Hellcat band. Interestingly, Prosperie is no longer grabbing his arm and appears mostly uninjured. Hegseth doesn't at all mention what had just transpired minutes before. Watch the interview below:
But that wasn't the end of this story. On Saturday morning, Prosperie posted to his Facebook a lengthy emotional message about the incident:
I was hit by an axe while performing a drum solo live on National TV…..words I never imagined saying! This happened last Sunday and I have been reluctant to post but starting to receive inquiries from concerned family and friends. I am thankful to God that the double sided blade only hit broadside on the outer elbow with significant impact and a couple of cuts as it fell along my wrist. It could have been much worse or fatal. Focusing on full physical and emotional recovery.
Pressed for more information by friends and family, he elaborated:
My leadership told me they were told there would be no axe throwing. I think the anchor person went rogue and decided to throw it. He had only thrown it once before in practice for an upcoming segment and they told him to throw it with more force. The vid you see is edited showing the Televised portion of the throw and then edited to a portion that was taken on someone's phone of us being videoed. The part that was actually televised showed the overthrown axe and then segued to us for the drum solo bump, only showing me walking behind the section holding my arm. The actual part where the axe hit me was not televised. Poor decision, obvious negligence, should not have happened, could have been avoided. When shooting or throwing, always know what is behind your target. Basic safety rule. I'm feeling blessed on Father's day with my 5 children, alive, and with all limbs.
Indeed, the televised portion didn't show the axe actually hitting Prosperie. And so here's his footage showing the Fox video plus the actual moment of impact, as posted by Prosperie:
Prosperie did not indicate whether he will pursue legal action or was compensated immediately for the incident. We've reached out to both Prosperie and Fox News for comment.

Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
A former Rutgers University student who used a computer webcam to spy on his roommate has been found guilty of anti-gay intimidation, a hate crime in New Jersey that could carry a prison term of up to 10 years.
In addition to this "bias intimidation" ruling, Dharun Ravi was also found guilty of privacy invasion for exposing the roommate's sexual encounter using the webcam. The New Jersey jury also convicted Mr. Ravi of tampering with evidence.
The roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide within days after learning that Ravi had said publicly via Twitter that "I saw him [Clementi] making out with a dude. Yay." The two had just started their freshman year at Rutgers.
Ravi's case drew national attention as a possible act of cyberbullying, bringing together concerns about animosity toward gays and about the rising prominence of social media forums like Twitter in daily life.
Although it's possible Ravi could get parts of the verdict overturned on appeal, legal analysts say the verdict sends a powerful message about the importance of respecting privacy rights – and watching what one says online.
"We still have an expectation of privacy, even in a social media age," says Bradley Shear, a Maryland attorney who specializes in privacy law. The case also stands as a warning, he says, that "the balance of your life can change in 140 characters or fewer."
A single Twitter post can be no more than 140 characters long, yet at least two such tweets figured prominently in Ravi's case.
In the first, Ravi announced witnessing the kissing, which he and a friend saw while remotely logged into his computer's video camera.
Two days later, when Clementi asked for a second night of privacy in the dorm room, Ravi told friends via a public Twitter message: "I dare you to video chat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again."
Even though no viewing of intimate activity occurred that night, and Ravi himself was at a sports practice, prosecutors said the tweet showed Ravi's intent to violate the privacy of Clementi and his friend, known in the trial as M.B.
Prosecutor Julia McClure said no viewing occurred that night because a worried Clementi shut down Ravi's computer in the room.
Although the evidence of privacy invasion may have been clear-cut, the jury's verdict on so-called bias intimidation was surprising to many observers of the trial. In part, that's because Ravi didn't seem like the archetypal antigay bully.
The prosecution didn't present evidence that he had made intimidating comments directly to his roommate, for example, or that he disparaged gays when talking with his friends.
But drawing on text messages between Ravi and his friends, as well as on Ravi's actions, the prosecution built a case that was strong enough to persuade the 12 jurors that the privacy invasion was motivated by Clementi's sexual orientation.
To prove guilt, the prosecution also had to show that Clementi felt intimidated by Ravi. Ms. McClure pointed out that Clementi was keeping a wary eye on Ravi's Twitter posts, and he consulted with a resident adviser about switching rooms and seeking to have Ravi punished for the privacy violation.
Ravi was not charged with being responsible for Clementi's death, but unless the verdict is overturned on appeal, he will serve a prison sentence of some length, says Robert Honecker, a defense attorney at Ansell Grimm & Aaron in Ocean, N.J.
Clementi's family has argued against a harsh punishment for Ravi, a factor that the judge will weigh.
Tyler Clementi's father, Joe Clementi, also made an appeal to young Americans after the verdict, stressing the importance of civility and tolerance: "You're going to meet a lot of people in your life," he said, according to the Associated Press. "Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean you have to work against them."
Legal experts have criticized New Jersey's bias intimidation law as overly vague, and as opening the door to potentially harsh sentences when a bias charge is tacked on to relatively minor crimes.
An appeal could challenge whether the jury properly applied the statute, Mr. Honecker said. The legislature, separately, may consider revising it for greater clarity.
Jurors had to decide on multiple points of law. While convicting Ravi of at least some portion of all 15 counts against him, they found him not guilty of some sections within certain counts.

But Shear says the jurors spoke loud and clear about the importance of privacy within homes and bedrooms. And he says the case may be a landmark one in reminding Americans of the role that electronic data can play in court.
"This proves how powerful digital evidence can be," he says. Viewing computer records or the text of a tweet "helps crystalize people's impressions."

While the focus in Westminster is still on the fallout from yesterday's court ruling and the parliamentary battle over Article 50, the foreign-policy focus in Whitehall is on Friday's visit to meet Donald Trump.
In the FT, George Parker has a good primer on what Downing Street wants out of the trip, while his colleague Demetri Sevastopulo has the view from the White House. Progress on a US-UK trade deal has become psychologically important on both sides. For the Trump administration, because it proves the hype over his ability as a dealmaker, and for Downing Street, as a proof-of-concept that the UK can survive and thrive as a beacon of free trade after Brexit.
The two sides will focus on the things they agree on: trade deals (good) and Islamic terrorism (bad). But the problem is that even on those areas of unity, the phrase “dialogue of the deaf” comes to mind.
Let's take trade. May's inner circle have been worried since before Trump's election that the Brexit vote, the global opposition to TTIP the success of Bernie Sanders and Trump's candidacy, let alone his victory, were all part of an alarming worldwide reaction against free trade. Trump's inner circle believe that every trade deal the United States has signed has been to the detriment of the other United States and to the advantage of other nations. As far as the global fight for free trade is concerned, Trump is part of the problem, not the solution.
Any US-UK trade deal is quickly going to get bogged down in the Trump administration's hostility to fair trade deals and the thorny issues of British agriculture and the public services.
And then there's Islamic terrorism. Trump believes that Vladimir Putin is part of the solution as far as Syria is concerned and seems to be willing to grant him freedom of manoeuvre not only as far as his own citizens are concerned but his immediate neighbourhood as well. The British government is among the most hostile to Putin in the world, something which will become even more striking once Francois Hollande enters retirement.
And those are just the areas we think we can at least make warm noises on as far as Trump is concerned. We shouldn't forget that May is not the first, but the second global leader to meet with Donald Trump since his shock election. The first was Shinzo Abe. Among his priorities: maintaining the security of America's allies in the Pacific and preserving TPP. Since that visit, Trump has continued to pioneer his destabilising new model of TweetDeck diplomacy as far as North Korea and China are concerned, and has mothballed TTP. The Prime Minister shouldn't expect her trip to work out any better.
Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs made a third attempt Monday to remove the Texas judge overseeing his child sex assault case, this time claiming God himself demands a change.
Jeff is head of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a group of self-described "fundamentalist Mormons," that includes the 1,000-member community of Bountiful near Creston, B.C.
During his trial, he filed a motion purporting to quote God as saying state District Judge Barbara Walther should "step away from this abuse of power against a religious and pure faith in the Lord."
Walther ruled the trial would continue. A hearing will eventually be held on Jeffs's motion, but it's unclear when.
Jeffs is accused of sexually assaulting two girls, ages 12 and 15, he took as brides in "spiritual marriages." His church is an offshoot of mainstream Mormonism that believes polygamy brings exaltation in Heaven, and followers see Jeffs as God's earthly spokesman.
DNA sample
Forensic analyst Amy Smuts, of the Human Identification Center at the University of North Texas in Fort Worth, testified Monday that a DNA sample collected from Jeffs had 15 major markers that matched a sample taken from a girl born to the 15-year-old mother. Smuts said that made her more than 99.99 per cent certain that Jeffs fathered the child, who was born in October 2005.
Monday's session ended in the late evening with lead prosecutor Eric Nichols showing a series of pictures where Jeffs was seen cuddling with, then kissing a red-head girl on the mouth. She had recently turned 12.
The image caused some in the public to gasp, but there was no visible reaction among jurors.
Jeffs, 55, fired his attorneys last week and has been representing himself. On Friday, he read a statement he said was from God, promising "sickness and death" for all involved unless the trial stops.
The charges against him stem from a police raid in April 2008 at Yearning For Zion, a West Texas church compound about 70 kilometres south of San Angelo.
Anonymous call
Authorities moved in after an anonymous call to an abuse shelter alleged that girls at the compound were being forced into polygamist marriages. The call turned out to be a hoax, and more than 400 children who had been placed in state custody were returned to their families.
But police seized marriage records and thousands of pages of documents and eventually charged Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men. All seven sect members who have been prosecuted so far have been convicted of crimes including sexual assault and bigamy and received prison sentences of between six and 75 years.
Jeffs has repeatedly called the raid an illegal search and wants a separate hearing on whether authorities violated his First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution to freedom of religion. Walther has refused.
Jeffs tried to recuse Walther twice before, but was then represented by attorneys who argued on his behalf. His latest motion, however, was based on a revelation Jeffs said the Lord gave him Sunday and addressed the judge directly, stating, "I, your lord, say to you, I shall bring to light your evil intent now, before all people, to destroy my Church on Earth."
The motion included an appendix Jeffs said was a revelation from God to early Mormon church leader Joseph Smith Jr. in 1843. Jeffs also attached what he called "Exhibit A," consisting of 29 orders from the Lord, including one in which God sent "a crippling disease upon [Walther] which shall take her life soon."
The judge contracted polio when she was younger and walks with a limp.
Jeffs went through seven attorneys in the six months leading up to the trial, firing his last defence team just as opening statements were to begin.
Church governs all aspects of life
In other testimony, former sect member Rebecca Musser explained that FLDS women are taught that they must rely on their husbands or fathers to find grace in heaven. She also said the church governs all aspects of members' lives, from dictating when they wake up every day to what clothes they wear, what work they do, how they comb their hair, and what they eat.
Musser was born into the sect but left in 2002. She was married in 1995, at age 19, to Rulon Jeffs, 85, Warren Jeffs's father and predecessor as ecclesiastical leader. She said Warren personally gave detailed lectures to young girls on what was expected of them sexually once they were ordered into spiritual marriages with older members.
"They are taught what the duties are as a wife to that husband, not just spiritually but physically," she said. "You give yourself to him and that means body, mind and spirit."
Nichols asked, "are young girls taught that giving themselves to that man and pleasing him is, in effect, pleasing God?"
"Yes," Musser replied.
We hear a great deal of whining about the horrors of segregation. Yet now that black militants have effectively seized control of the University of Missouri, the first thing they do (after whining some more) is segregate:
Student protesters at the University of Missouri asked white supporters to leave Wednesday night in order to create a “black only healing space.”
What exactly they are supposedly healing from is unclear. Maybe it is the fictitious fecal swastika, or it could be the imaginary attack by the KKK.
Prominent Black Lives Matter activist Johnetta Elzie seemingly confirmed those with Caucasian skin were asked to leave the area, tweeting that the group had created a “black only healing space for the students to share, decompress, be vulnerable & real.”
Being real will take some work, considering that the entire spectacle — going all the way back to the deification of the cop-assaulting lowlife Michael Brown, whose timely death inspired Black Lives Matter — is based on lies.
The news comes after the Concerned Student 1950 group had blasted the “white media” earlier this week for not “respecting black spaces.”
Melissa Click must be all torn up inside that she would no longer be welcome in the public “safe space” she called for “muscle” to defend from nosy journalists.
Here's an idea: relocate the “black healing space” to Africa. That way no white liberals could pollute it with their cringing, obsequious presence without flying across the ocean.

On a tip from Christopher T.
Since everything in the world is being remade, why not this? I'm told that “Kindergarten Cop,” the hit Ivan Reitman movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is on deck for a remake. The new film comes from Universal's 1440 division, which typically remakes old movies into sequels for VOD. This one may be a stalking horse for a TV series of some kind, too.
The new film will be directed by Michael Don Paul (“The Island”) from a script by David H. Steinberg, who wrote “American Pie.” The new Kindergarten cop is a leading man type with an Indian sidekick named Sanjit. They're on the trail of a missing flash drive from the Federal Witness protection program. Somehow it's wound up in a kindergarten class. Flimsy premise, but it puts him side by side with a beautiful teacher and they hit it off. There's also bad guys involved– this time they're Albanian.
I'm told producers are looking for cross over names from TV. Since they've had so much fun doing a Lifetime movie, maybe Will Ferrell and Kristin Wiig can try this next!
Hogan Gidley, who served as national communications director for Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign, appeared on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon to discuss a crucial aspect of the Republican primary: the previous obscure, but increasingly notorious, Rule 40.
Technically, most of the analysts citing Rule 40 are referring to the current version of Rule 40(b), which sets a certain minimum threshold for candidates at the Republican National Convention. According to this rule, candidates must arrive at the convention with a majority of the delegates from eight states or territories, or else they are disqualified from the first round. In most elections, this is a mere formality because the clear winner of the nomination is well-known before the convention begins, making the convention an extended infomercial for the party and its nominee.
Of course, there is good reason to suspect the Republican convention will be rather more exciting this year. Gidley noted there is apprehension among front-runner Donald Trump's supporters that the GOP Establishment will use some “shenanigans” to “steal” the nomination from him at the convention. Among those shenanigans could be changing Rule 40 to bring candidates who don't meet the established minimum threshold into the game.
There are two ghosts from the 2012 election haunting the Shakespearean drama of the 2016 primary, and Gidley invoked them both in a single breath: Ron Paul and Mitt Romney.
“This is actually called the ‘Ron Paul Rule.' The Romney people put this in place,” Gidley explained. “The Establishment hurt Ron Paul, but I think this Establishment rule will actually help Donald Trump.”
Gidley noted there is no way for one of the last three remaining candidates, Governor John Kasich of Ohio, to win the necessary majority of delegates from eight states. Texas Senator Ted Cruz currently stands at seven.
He further asserted that, contrary to much speculation from pundits, Rule 40(b) technically blocks disqualified candidates from participating in any of the subsequent ballots, which scuttles the notion of denying Trump victory in an initial vote where only he and Cruz are qualified candidates, and then parachuting some other Establishment-preferred candidate into the convention hall to seize the nomination, possibly someone who didn't even run in the 2016 primary at all.
(Cruz is arguably even less acceptable to the Establishment of his own party than Trump — a point that will be made by many an anguished Hamlet delivering monologues over the skull of Marco Yorick in the weeks ahead, to continue that Shakespeare metaphor.)
Rule 40 “was an effort to stop the Ron Paul faction from gaining traction at the convention,” Gidley recalled. “And now we see the fruits of that rule, which was designed to stop Ron Paul, could effectively stop the Establishment.”
“The second part of the rule is, you can't even count votes for anybody else who doesn't meet that threshold,” he pointed out. “So people can try to submit votes for other people — like Kasich, or like Rubio, or like Romney — but if you haven't won a majority of the delegates in eight states, you can't be on any ballot, at any time. First, second, third, fourth, fifth — it doesn't matter.”
It has been suggested that the Rules Committee will simply change Rule 40 to arrange whatever outcome is necessary to block Trump, but Gidley was skeptical of this idea. Normally, a presumptive candidate who has reached the “magic number” of bound delegates needed to secure the nomination can control the rules. If Trump is held below that 1,237-delegate threshold this year, the Rules Committee could theoretically rewrite the rules to hurt him, but Gidley anticipated sheer chaos if such tactics were employed.
“If you think people are mad now … it's gonna be a political jihad,” he warned.

Jovens em Malmo, cidade no sul da Suécia; há 40 anos, país era como o Brasil hoje, que criminaliza o aborto e condena mulheres à clandestinidade
1975. Maria descobre que está grávida e, depois de muita angústia e desespero, vividos em total solidão, decide abortar. Conversa com algumas amigas que sabem “o caminho das pedras”: uma clínica de aborto clandestino fora da cidade. Marcado o dia do procedimento, ela pega o trem para o interior sentindo-se uma criminosa fugitiva. Chegando ao local, percebe a inferioridade e insegurança da infraestrutura, mas se entrega à cirurgia entre o arrependimento, a angústia e a culpa. No mesmo dia, volta para casa, tem uma grave hemorragia e é encaminhada à emergência do hospital “legal”. Cercada por olhares julgadores da equipe médica, e pelo preconceito e rejeição da própria família, Maria morre. Fim.
2015. Maria descobre que está grávida e, depois de muito pensar e conversar com seu companheiro, decide abortar. Vai até a clínica de mulheres do hospital da cidade e é recebida pela equipe médica treinada e designada para trabalhar com a temática. Mas Maria ainda está insegura sobre sua decisão, pois se sente culpada e, por isso, pede a ajuda de um psicólogo. A consulta é marcada e o profissional a ajuda a expressar seus sentimentos e conflitos em torno da gravidez e do aborto, sem direcionar sua decisão. Maria sai da clínica e, passados alguns dias, marca o dia do procedimento. No dia, toma o remédio indicado pela clínica e espera o efeito em casa – poderia ficar na clínica, mas achou melhor estar com alguém de seu círculo afetivo. Feito o aborto, novas consultas para controle são marcadas. A ela, é oferecido também acompanhamento psicológico pós-aborto. Fim.

As duas histórias acima são fictícias, mas baseadas em fatos reais. Elas mostram dois momentos distintos da história recente da Suécia: o antes e o depois da legalização do aborto no país. A lei, que devolveu às mulheres suecas o direito de decidir sobre seus próprios corpos, completou 40 anos em janeiro, e foi comemorada como uma das conquistas de direitos humanos e igualdade mais importantes de todos os tempos no país. Até mesmo um grande festival de música, organizado pela organização de direitos sexuais e reprodutivos RSFU (Riksförbundet för sexuell upplysning), foi realizado para comemorar a data. Entre o público havia famílias inteiras com crianças pequenas.
Mas voltemos ao “antes” sueco, assustadoramente semelhante ao “hoje” brasileiro. Também por aqui, salvo em casos excepcionais como estupro, incesto e risco para a vida da mãe, o aborto era crime há 40 anos e, portanto, passível de tribunal. Essa situação levava ao cenário tão conhecido quanto previsível. Até a década de 1970, milhares de mulheres suecas morriam todos os anos em decorrência de procedimentos mal feitos em clínicas ilegais localizadas em pontos escondidos de Estocolmo e no interior, ou em suas próprias casas. Às que sobreviviam, mas tinham sua verdade revelada, o destino era o julgamento, moral e legal.
Em entrevista para a edição de janeiro da revista Situation Stockholm, a “Ocas” sueca, Marc Bygdeman, professor emérito em obstetrícia e ginecologia do Instituto Karolinska e ativista pelo direito ao aborto livre há 50 anos, conta mais detalhes deste tempo. “Existia uma lei de aborto extremamente restritiva, que aprovava somente cerca de 3 mil abortos legais por ano. Enquanto isso, eram registrados cerca de 15 mil abortos ilegais acompanhados de complicações e mortes. Se uma mulher quisesse solicitar aborto em Estocolmo, ela era obrigada a ir até clínica de saúde mental, que cuidava dos pedidos. Qual era a mensagem? Que uma mulher que desejasse abortar era doente mental?”, conta.

A restrição era tamanha que as mulheres suecas passaram a pagar por abortos em países onde o procedimento era legalizado, com destaque para a Polônia comunista. O mercado de abortos no estrangeiro, um verdadeiro escândalo para uma Suécia que se considerava liberal, veio a público em 1965. Em uma operação batizada de “Negócio da Polônia” (livre tradução), a polícia invadiu a casa e prendeu o ativista Hans Nestius, que ajudava mulheres a viajar para o país vizinho. Era o estopim de um intenso debate nacional em torno da legalização do aborto e encabeçado, na época, pelos jornais Expressen e Aftonbladet. Neste mesmo ano, pressionado pela opinião pública, intelectuais e setores da classe médica, o governo arquivou o processo contra Nestius e assumiu os trabalhos em torno de uma eventual liberalização da lei.
Motivados pelos ventos favoráveis demonstrados pela abertura do governo ao debate, estudantes, liberais, socialdemocratas, e o novo movimento organizado de mulheres liderado pelo chamado Grupp 8 — coletivo feminista fundado em 1972 por oito suecas pioneiras — se uniram aos grupos que já vinham lutando pelo direito ao aborto desde a década de 1930: esquerda organizada, RFSU, médicos simpatizantes e intelectuais feministas da “antiga”. Como resultado, entre 1965 e 1974, fase mais intensa do movimento pró-aborto sueco, os diversos grupos realizaram centenas de debates, protestos reunindo milhares de pessoas, publicações em veículos simpatizantes da causa e incursões junto aos partidos com cadeiras no Parlamento. Os novos tempos mostravam que, definitivamente, não havia mais espaço para o questionamento do direito ao aborto. As mulheres exigiam mudanças, e não toleravam mais esperar.
Police have been banned from pursuing criminals on mopeds or motorbikes on London's streets because of the risk to the suspect or members of the public.
Officers have been issued with new guidance saying they must wait for a police helicopter unless there are exceptional circumstances.
The move comes as mobile phone snatches involving gangs on mopeds has soared by 31 per cent in the capital.
One victim who had his phone snatched says officers told him: “We are getting smashed over this.”
filmmaker Dan Murdoch, 32, had his iPhone stolen outside his office in Camden. He told the Sun: “I'm the third person in my office this has happened to in the last few weeks.”
The new rules were issued just weeks before Henry Hicks, 18, died when he crashed his moped while being pursued by officers in Islington in December last year.
The Met's “police driver and vehicle policy” states that police drivers should make a risk assessment when faced with a suspect who has failed to stop.
They are told to consider if the suspect is wearing a helmet, has protective clothing or has a pillion passenger.
Police helicopters should be called in whenever possible, but if one is not available the pursuit should be stopped.
The policy says drivers can only mount pursuits in rare cases such as if the rider is involved in a serious offence, or “there is clear potential for grave consequences” such as “an immediate threat to life, significant damage to property or issues of national security.”
Four police officers who were chasing Henry Hicks in two police cars when he crashed have been issued with notices warning them they are under investigation by the police watchdog.

BATON ROUGE, La. — Standing amid piles of waterlogged debris, President Barack Obama on Tuesday promised a sustained national effort to rebuild flood-ravaged southern Louisiana “even after the TV cameras leave” on a visit aimed in part at stemming campaign-season criticism that he's been slow to respond to the disaster.
As he toured a battered neighborhood and spoke to reporters, Obama reassured residents that the federal response would be robust and he tried to buck up beleaguered residents of the water-soaked region, many of whom have said they feel their plight has been ignored by national officials and the media.
“This is not a one-off, this is not a photo-op issue,” the president said in a statement to reporters. “I need all Americans to stay focused on this … I know you will rebuild again.”
Obama's visit was a reminder of the political dangers and opportunities that natural disasters can pose. The president has been criticized for waiting until after this New England vacation to tour the flooding. The timing, coming amid a heated presidential campaign, drew criticism from some local officials and Republicans political opponents, including GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.
Trump made the visit to Baton Rouge on Friday.
Obama told reporters he doesn't “worry too much” about politics and said he saw Americans coming together to help.
The president walked past mattresses, appliances and heaps of clothing tossed out on the curb in a middle-class neighborhood in East Baton Rouge Parish, where few homes were spared from late-summer storms that killed at least 13 people in the region and displaced thousands.
Going door-to-door and trailed by cameras, he offered sympathy to residents as they took a break from the cleanup to talk about the damage.
“I wish I was coming at a better time,” he told one resident, as he put his arm around her and walked into her home for a brief tour. “But I'm glad to see everybody is safe, at least.”
The White House said Obama is willing to assume criticism about “optics” as long as the federal response is up to par.
“The survivors of the flooding in Louisiana are not well served by a political discussion; they're well served by a competent, effective, strong, coordinated government response,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday. “And the federal government has certainly done our part in the first eight to 10 days after this disaster, but there's a long road ahead.”
Obama was met at the Baton Rouge airport by a bipartisan group of officials, including Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican. Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy and David Vitter also met the president on the tarmac.
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton issued a statement Monday saying she would visit the communities affected by the flooding “at a time when the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response, to discuss how we can and will rebuild together.”
The storm and its flooding have damaged an estimated 60,000 homes and forced thousands to seek temporary housing. More than 115,000 people have registered for federal disaster aid, with the state saying $20 million has been distributed to individuals so far. At least 40 state highways remained closed.
Nearly 11 years ago, Hurricane Katrina's crippling of New Orleans and the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama demonstrated how political leaders cannot afford to underestimate the gravity of responding to natural disasters with force and immediacy. In 2005, then-President George W. Bush was faulted by critics for flying over but not touching down in Louisiana in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a decision he years later described as a mistake.
In 2012, Obama and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney wasted no time in heading to Louisiana to see the damage from Hurricane Isaac.
The White House on Monday pointed to praise for the federal government from the state's Democratic governor and Republican lieutenant governor as evidence of an effective response. And it dismissed criticism of Obama's decision to stay away during the first week-and-a-half after the flooding as politically motivated.
Bel Edwards, who took office this year, said he suggested to Obama and presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett that they delay a trip to Louisiana until the initial disaster response was over and recovery efforts had started.
Obama signed a disaster declaration on August 14 that makes federal funding available for assistance such as grants for temporary housing and home repairs, and low-cost loans to cover losses for uninsured property. He subsequently dispatched FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to the region.
A PUNTING epidemic has gripped the ranks of AFL players.
David Schwarz, a reformed gambling addict, who will front the AFL's revamped gambling program, says he has talked to up to 30 current players with major gambling problems.
Horse racing and multi-bets placed across a range of sports, mostly American, are the biggest attraction.
The Herald Sun has learned of:
A PLAYER who dropped $30,000 in a day betting on horses.
ANOTHER player who lost $40,000 on a Saturday before playing next day.
MARK ROBINSON: GAMBLING FOOTY'S SECRET SCOURGE
Schwarz said last night he had spoken to players who had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“It's an escalating problem ... it's bordering on being an epidemic,'' he said.
“I know players who have lost three-quarters of their wages in a month through gambling, which is hundreds of thousands over time.''
Leading player manager Paul Connors last night said of gambling: “It's the hidden problem in footy.''
And an AFL club chief executive, who did not wish to be named, said last night: “After training, the players go home and they are bored and start betting. American sports, that's what they bet on: the NFL, the NBA.''
In late March team captains alerted the AFL to the growing crisis, warning gambling was the No.1 problem with players in their spare time.
media_camera Some players aren't afraid to lose up to $100,000 a year gambling, Schwarz says.
But many players don't inform their clubs or the AFL Players Association because they are scared their names will be made public.
The AFL will shortly announce a new range of measures to help players.
“Ultimately, one player struggling with a gambling problem is one too many,'' said Andrew Dillon, the AFL's general counsel.
“David Schwarz has approached the AFL and put forward a proposal for a progressive gambling support program for players and the wider AFL community that is under consideration.”
Schwarz said growing numbers of players were contacting him for help each season.
“It affects their football,'' he said.
“I've spoken to a number of clubs, a number of players and player managers, and they believe it's the biggest problem with the players.
“It varies from managers who are concerned about their player, to players who are fully blown problem gamblers.
“They are on the verge of losing everything, or have hit a point where they will never recover,” Schwarz said.
“They will walk out of the game without having accumulated anything, and they have been in the system for eight to 10 years.
“The mindset is, they believe they are going to earn big money, so if they lose $100,000 in a year it's not a big deal.
“Some managers take full control of their money and give them an allowance each week,'' Schwarz said.

LISTEN TO DAVID SCHWARZ SPEAK ON THE ISSUE ON SEN ON TUESDAY MORNING:
Ohio State's replacement for Tim Beck is an old colleague of Urban Meyer.
Ryan Day as a Coach
Year Team Duty 2002 New Hampshire Tight Ends 2003-04 Boston College Graduate Assistant 2005 Florida Graduate Assistant 2006 Temple Wide Receivers 2007–11 Boston College Wide Receivers 2012 Temple Offensive Coordinator/WRs 2013–14 Boston College Offensive Coordinator/QBs 2015 Philadelphia Eagles Quarterbacks 2016 San Francisco 49ers Quarterbacks
Ryan Day is next in line to coach the quarterbacks, the school announced Tuesday morning. Bruce Feldman of FOX SPORTS first reported the news, adding that Day will also work as a coordinator.
Day steps in for Beck, who according to the Buckeyes "is pursuing other opportunities." Beck reportedly left to work with Tom Herman at Texas.
Day, 37, partially cut his teeth under Meyer in 2005 as a graduate assistant. That was Meyer's first season as the head coach at Florida and the Gators went 9-3, winning the Outback Bowl over Iowa. It was Day's third season as a graduate assistant at the Division I level — he worked at Boston College in 2003-04. Day's first coaching job came a year earlier at New Hampshire, where he coached tight ends. At Boston College, Day helped turn running back Andre Williams into a Heisman Trophy finalist in 2013.
Day spent the 2016 season in San Francisco working with Chip Kelly and the 49ers. He coached quarterbacks there for Kelly, doing the same thing a year earlier during the former head coach's final season with the Philadelphia Eagles. The 49ers fired Kelly on Sunday, so it makes sense that Day would move on too.
Day played for Kelly (then an offensive coordinator) at the University of New Hampshire, where he set four career records. He has worked with quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends and offenses during his entire football career.
The next chapter in his football life is to work under Meyer, who emphatically proclaimed that his team will be better at throwing the ball after its 31-0 defeat to Clemson in the Fiesta Bowl.
"We will become a good passing team, we will. Next year,” Meyer said.
A chance discovery by a group of repairmen in Boston has led to the unearthing of a centuries-old time capsule, believed to have been buried there in the 1790s by Paul Revere and Samuel Adams.
The antique time capsule, which had been placed in a cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House, was discovered this week when workers who had been repairing a water leak at the building stumbled upon it, CNN reports.
Museum of Fine Arts conservator Pamela Hatchfield was promptly called in for her expertise, and on Thursday, after about seven hours of painstaking, backbreaking work, she -- with the help of several workers -- successfully extricated the almost cigar box-sized container from its burial place.
"I feel happy and relieved and excited,” Hatchfield told the Associated Press after the time capsule's successful removal, “and really interested to see what's in this box.”
Massachusetts officials work to remove the time capsule from the cornerstone on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2014.
The time capsule is believed to have first been buried at the State House in 1795 by revolutionary war hero Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, who was the governor of Massachusetts at the time. It's thought to be one of the oldest time capsules in the United States.
According to the Boston Globe, the antique container was unearthed once before, in 1855, when emergency repairs to the foundation reportedly led to its temporary removal. However, it hasn't seen the light of day since.
Hatchfield holds the the time capsule on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2014.
As for what treasures the capsule may contain, Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin told CNN the box is known to house “a Paul Revere plate, papers, and coins from the 1600s," among other artifacts. The condition of the container's contents, however, remains unknown.
Galvin said that the capsule will be X-rayed and examined by experts, and its contents will likely be revealed to the public next week.
Northern Virginia Bureau Reporter David Culver talks to the Alexandria Sheriff about a deputy that's under arrest for allegedly raping a female inmate. (Published Wednesday, May 28, 2014)
An Alexandria Sheriff's Office deputy accused of sexually assaulting a female inmate has been fired.
According to a news release, an inmate at the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center told another deputy that Deputy Bryant Pegues sexually assaulted her Tuesday morning.
"She did not hesitate ... [to tell another] deputy,who immediately reported it and did the right thing," Sheriff Dana Lawhorne said.
Sheriff's Office commanders contected Alexandria Police, and Pegues, 52, was arrested later that evening.
He is charged with rape and carnal knowledge of an inmate. He was denied bond.
"We are entrusted with the lives and safety of those in our custody," Lawhorne said. "The criminal actions of Bryant Pegues are a grave violation of the public trust. We will continue to assist Alexandria police and the Commonwealth's Attorney as they pursue a successful prosecution."
Alexandria Police are withholding Pegues' mugshot, adding releasing it could hurt the ongoing investigation.
Sheriff Lawhorne said there may be more victims.
"If he's done it before, and there's more than one [victim], let the chips fall where they may and it'll fall right on him," Lawhorne said.
Pegues, a resident of Oxon Hill, Maryland, has lost his job with the sheriff's office. He joined the department in 2007.

By Richard McVey
David Mudd Monster trucks of today owe their existence to Bob Chandler and Bigfoot, the Ford F-250 truck that he customized for off-road weekend adventures.
https://americanprofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/bob-chandler-bigfoot-150x150.jpg
In 1974, St. Louis construction worker Bob Chandler purchased a Ford F-250 pickup truck to haul tools and equipment during the week and to take off-road excursions through the Missouri countryside on the weekends. Within a year, his newfound passion for four-wheeling turned into a business. With the help of his wife, Marilyn, and longtime friend Jim Kramer, he opened a parts and service shop, the Midwest Four-Wheel Drive Center, in Hazelwood, Mo. (pop. 25,703).
It turned out that Chandler was his own best customer, as he routinely bent, buckled and broke his truck during his hill-climbing, mudslinging adventures. Each time his truck broke down, he rebuilt it slightly bigger and stronger.
“I would break an axle, so I'd put a bigger one on the truck,” recalls Chandler, 70. “Then I'd put bigger tires on. Then I didn't have enough power, so I'd put a bigger engine in it. It was a vicious cycle.”
Chandler became so infamous for driving to extremes that his shop manager nicknamed him Bigfoot. “We always had to tow him home,” says Kramer, 60. “We told him, ‘If you'd keep that big foot of yours off the gas, we wouldn't have to do this all the time.”
Chandler painted the nickname on his truck, which had grown to monstrous proportions, sporting heavy-duty axles, a super-charged eight-cylinder engine, four-wheel steering and tires that measured 48 inches tall. By 1979, the oversize pickup was garnering so much attention from off-road enthusiasts that a promoter asked Chandler to bring his truck to a Denver, Colo., auto show. “I thought, ‘What, you'll pay me?'” Chandler recalls. “We ended up making some posters of the truck and made $300. We thought we were rich.”
As Chandler continued making public appearances, people began to call his truck Bigfoot. During one show, motor sports promoter Bob George coined the phrase “monster truck” to describe Bigfoot and the monster truck phenomenon was born.
Crushing success
In 1981, Chandler introduced a smashing stunt to the fledgling sport. In a cornfield near his shop, with his brother holding a video camera, Chandler took aim at two junk cars and crushed them with Bigfoot, just to appease his own curiosity. “I wanted to see if I could do it,” he says. “I was surprised at how easy it was.”
He played the video for customers at his shop, where another show promoter saw it and pleaded with Chandler to duplicate the deed in front of a crowd. Chandler was reluctant at first, debating whether to re-create the stunt. “It seemed like it was destructive and negative,” he recalls.
Ultimately, Chandler decided to crush more cars, performing in front of a small but delighted crowd at a Missouri event. For a subsequent show, Chandler built Bigfoot No. 2, taking the truck to the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan, where he fitted the behemoth with the now standard 66-inch-tall, 700-pound tires, originally made for fertilizer spreaders.
“They had 68,000 people show up,” he says. “I drove up on the cars, stopped and waved to the crowd. Flash bulbs were going off and 30,000 people came over the walls. My son was in the passenger seat. I said, ‘Roll up your window and lock your door because I don't know what's happening!'”
The Chandlers sat in the truck for 10 minutes, waiting for security personnel to usher euphoric fans back to their seats.
The car-smashing stunt was a defining moment, which confirmed that Chandler's heavy-footed hobby had moved from off-road gatherings and small auto shows into mainstream popularity. To meet public demand, Chandler and his crew built other Bigfoot trucks and soon other monster truck teams were cropping up across the nation. By 1984, up to 40 monster trucks were performing coast to coast.
“I think everyone was influenced by Bob and Bigfoot,” says Jeff Cook, 41, president of the International Monster Truck Museum & Hall of Fame in Auburn, Ind. (pop. 12,731). “Anybody in the first 20 years of the sport can probably tell you the first place they saw Bigfoot or got to meet Bob Chandler. That's a big highlight in most people's lives.”
Monster business
Today, monster trucks are the machines that drive a multimillion-dollar industry, featuring ominous names such as Grave Digger, King Krunch and Maximum Destruction. Cook estimates that 300 monster trucks—ranging from single-driver operations to large corporate-sponsored teams—entertain millions of fans nationwide each year.
Weighing about 10,000 pounds with 1,500 horsepower engines, modern monster trucks are faster, stronger and safer than their pioneering predecessors. Many of the advances—from superior parts to mass audience appeal—owe their existence to Chandler, who now owns 22 vehicles emblazoned with the Bigfoot name.
“The sport has changed a lot since Bob first started with the original Bigfoot,” says Dan Runte, 46, a 22-year driver for Chandler's team. “But all along the way he's been an innovator in the sport, especially with safety.”
During monster truck events, drivers are strapped into custom-built seats with harnesses, and wear helmets, fire-safety suits and head-and-neck support systems because, as Runte says, “we've gone from driving over cars and vans to crushing bread trucks and school buses.”
Chandler has witnessed the sport's evolution. “Back when I started out, my safety equipment was my cowboy hat and a lap belt,” says Chandler, who in 1987 co-founded the Monster Truck Racing Association, which developed industry-wide rules and safety guidelines.
Although he retired from competitive driving in the 1990s, Chandler remains active in the sport, spending most days overseeing his 17,000-square-foot Bigfoot facility and four-wheel drive shop in Hazelwood.
“A lot of guys would have stopped after being able to say they were the first to do something,” Cook says. “But Bob's very passionate about what he does and still enjoys it.”
One of his biggest thrills is meeting ardent fans and seeing their excitement when Bigfoot enters an arena. “We had a lady call and say, ‘My grandmother is going to be 80 next week and all she wants for her birthday is to ride in Bigfoot,” Chandler says. “I told her, ‘You bring her over and we'll give her a ride.' So we did. All you could see was her nose sticking over the dash. She loved it.”
A US lawmaker in Virginia is calling on the US Air Force to reverse a decision to remove a Latin reference to God from a logo after an atheist group complained.
Republican Randy Forbessaid the US Air Force removed the logo from the Rapid Capabilities Office several weeks ago. The patch included a line written in Latin that read, "Doing God's Work with Other People's Money".
But after the Military Association of Atheists and Freethinkers complained, Forbes said the line was rewritten in Latin to read, "Doing Miracles with Other People's Money".
Forbes, along with a bipartisan group of 35 lawmakers, sent a letter to US Air Force secretary Michael Donley and Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz expressing concern over the decision to remove a non-religious reference to God.
"It is most egregious," Forbes told FOX News. "The air force is taking the tone that you can't even use the word 'God.'"
Forbes said his office contacted the air force, and officials there confirmed that the logo was changed after the atheist group complained.
A spokesman for the air force told FOX News that it received the letter and would investigate the claims.
Forbes said the removal of "God" is a "bridge too far in terms of the rights of men and women who serve in our services and their ability to express their faith," adding that "the significance of this is what the air force is saying with this move - that the word 'God', whether it has any reference to faith or not, can't be used in the air force."
He said the incident is one of several in recent months that caused him to wonder if the military is cleansing itself of religious references.
"It's a very dangerous course to take," he added.

The line drawn between so-called literary fiction and genre fiction has always irked me. As I embarked upon a re-read of the first two volumes of Lev Grossman's frustrating Magicians trilogy, this issue resurfaced. Grossman's books have, for reasons that boggle my mind, sparked a debate about just what constitutes literature. As the final book in Grossman's trilogy was published relatively recently, the debate has continued.
Type “define literary fiction” into Google and you'll get the following definition:
Literary fiction is a term principally used for certain fictional works that hold literary merit. In other words, they are works that offer deliberate commentary on larger social issues, political issues, or focus on the individual to explore some part of the human condition. (Emphasis added)
To quote the popular orator “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, “What?!”
Show of hands—how many of you think that, based upon the definition given above, Dune, Childhood's End, Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire and Joe Abercrombie's novels fit that definition? What about comics? Locke & Key, The Walking Dead, X-Men. Those are just three that fit the bill. According to the intelligentsia, however, the works I just listed are merely “genre fiction.” Mass market pfaff. Intellectually unworthy.
Type “define genre fiction” and the Google gnomes will tell you that:
Genre fiction, also known as popular fiction, is plot-driven fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre. Genre fiction is generally distinguished from literary fiction. (Emphasis added)
So, unless my reading comprehension skills have diminished to the point of uselessness, the difference between literary fiction and genre fiction is that genre fiction is, by design, entertaining. Literary fiction is not. Because as far as I'm concerned, nearly every fantasy or sci-fi novel I've read could correctly be viewed as “deliberate commentary on larger social issues, political issues, or focus on the individual to explore some part of the human condition.”
What exactly is the problem here? Why is there a disconnect? Shouldn't books be books and shouldn't we encourage reading of all sorts? This elitist notion that novels that is fun, engaging and entertaining are not literature is asinine. And sure, what constitutes fun, engaging and entertaining is subjective. But for every reader out there that loves McSweeney's and Infinite Jest, there are 100 that have read the Harry Potter novels. Maybe 1,000. Maybe more. And the cultural impact of the Potter books, or a series like A Song of Ice and Fire, is far greater than any work of Jonathan Franzen or Don DeLillo.
That Grossman's books are fantasy seems patently obvious to me. And I also consider them works of literature. They make me think. They make me look both inward and outward. And, for the most part, they are entertaining. (Except when the navel gazing gets to be a bit excessive. Then I feel like I'm reading the fictional equivalent of skinny jeans and a stupid moustache). Why have the debate at all? Why should reading be an “either/or” situation when the vast majority of readers enjoy diverse subjects in equal measure? Methinks the snobs doth protest too much…
Literary merit is not reserved for pretentious, impenetrable, masturbatory drivel that does nothing but lend itself to stuffy discussion and analysis and to suggest otherwise is the worst kind of elitism. It impedes the collective literacy of cultures and does nothing but create an “us vs. them” intellectual class war that is damaging and counterproductive.
Fantasy and sci-fi fans—the outcasts of genre fiction for years—are often some of the most progressive, open-minded and intelligent readers out there. And we use our favorite works of fiction as inspiration. We write. We invent. We create. We explore. We look inward, down to the molecules we're made of, and we look outward beyond the stars. Genre fiction can and has been a propulsive force. To deny that, to decry it, to pretend it doesn't exist—well, that is the real fiction.

Police officers swarmed a man early Tuesday who allegedly jumped into a three-wheel GoCar sightseeing vehicle and drove off with it in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, employees said.
The theft occurred about 10 a.m. at GoCar Tours near the intersection of Mason and O'Farrell streets, said Matthew Sheble, a director of operations at the tour agency. But with the GoCar capable of a maximum speed of 40 mph, it didn't take police long to to catch the culprit.
The suspect, who was not identified, jumped into a small, yellow, two-seat car as customers who had rented the vehicle were putting on their helmets, Sheble said.
“The guy just jumped in and within ten seconds it was gone,” Sheble said.
A man was arrested in the South of Market neighborhood of San Francisco after allegedly stealing a GoCar, witnesses said.

As the GoCar thief drove off, he was quickly stopped by a flock of police on bikes and in patrol cars at the intersection of Mission and Fifth streets, less than a quarter mile from where the theft occurred.
Onlookers stood by as officers ordered the suspect out of the three-wheeler with his hands in the air. At about 10:40 a.m., the suspect sat handcuffed on the curb on Fifth Street as officers surrounded him.
Greg Fuentes, a 29-year-old Brentwood resident, said he was getting ready to work on installing phone lines nearby when he heard sirens and saw the arrest unfold.
It was “probably one of the funniest things I've seen,” Fuentes said. “All the cops were laughing.”
And it wasn't hard to get the driver to stop, the car wasn't going very fast, he added.
“Probably as fast as that little car can go,” Fuentes said, chuckling.
GoCar Tours offer customers a GPS-guided tour through the city.
“We've had one other instance like this of someone jumping into the car this year,” Sheble said. “It's very infrequent.”

(CNN) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders angrily clashed over auto industry bailouts, guns, political battles from the 1990s and ties to Wall Street on Sunday, as underlying tensions in the Democratic presidential race burst into the open at an impassioned CNN debate in Flint, Michigan .
The forum quickly turned into a heated philosophical argument about an economy that Sanders said is weighted against the middle and working classes and is abetted, he said, by close ties between politicians, such as Clinton, and Wall Street financiers.
Sanders accused Clinton of supporting "disastrous" trade policies that contributed to corporate America's decision to move manufacturing from cities like Flint to low-wage economies in Central America and Asia. But she in turn said that Sanders had refused to vote for a bailout for the auto industry that was included in the outgoing Bush administration's attempts to stave off the financial crisis.
"If everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with it," Clinton said.
Clinton also pressed Sanders on guns and accused him of being too close to the National Rifle Association.
"You talk about corporate greed. The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make," Clinton said.
Sanders replied by responding that Clinton's arguments, effectively, would amount to a ban on the manufacture of guns.
At one point, both candidates talked over one another in their determination to make their points about the economy.
"Excuse me, I am talking," Sanders said.
Sanders repeatedly knocked Clinton for her ties to the finance industry and demanded that she release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street firms. Clinton said she will do so when other candidates, including Republicans, agree to do the same.
Clear schisms
While the exchanges were intense and revealed clear schisms between Clinton and Sanders, they were largely confined to policy differences, and lacked the personal -- and even vulgar -- tone that characterized the last two Republican debates.
Both candidates billed themselves as the best possible person to take on the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump , in a general election. Clinton slammed what she said was the "bigotry, bullying and bluster" of the GOP front-runner, while her rival pointed to polls indicating he was more likely to beat the billionaire.
Clinton and Sanders opened the debate agreeing on one point: that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder should step down over his response to the toxic water crisis in Flint.

Sanders accused Synder of "dereliction of duty" while Clinton said the governor should "resign or be recalled" -- a comment that represented a new position for the former secretary of state.
Snyder tweeted in his own defense during the debate.
"I'm taking responsibility as our value system says we should. My track record is getting things done, and I want to get this done," he wrote on Twitter.
Both candidates expressed alarm over the water crisis that erupted in Flint when government officials switched the city's water source temporarily in April 2014 from the Great Lakes to the Flint River to cut costs. Pollution from the highly corrosive river water then ate into the city's water system, causing lead to leach into the water supply.
"It's raining lead in Flint," Clinton said.
Sanders recalled his visit to the city last month and said, "What I heard and what I saw literally shattered me."
Race and America
The candidates offered candid assessments of race in America. Clinton, when asked what racial blind spots she had, admitted that it was impossible for her to share the experience of many African-Americans, but she said she tried to understand the issues the community faces.
"I think (by) being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had," she said. "And I think it's incumbent upon me, and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign, is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have 'the talk' with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever."

Sanders hit an awkward note as he sought to empathize with discrimination facing African-Americans, a demographic he has struggled to win in several primary contests.
"When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto," Sanders said. "You don't know what it's like to be poor. You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car."
Super Saturday victories
The debate in Flint came a day after Sanders pulled off morale-boosting Super Saturday victories in Kansas and Nebraska , doubling up on Clinton, who won the Louisiana primary on Saturday.
During the debate, CNN projected that Sanders would win the Maine Democratic caucuses. But Clinton's victory in Louisiana, which had the most delegates on offer this weekend, means that her lead in the presidential race of about 200 pledged delegates, remains essentially the same.
Michigan holds its primary on Tuesday.

The Democratic campaign is unfolding amid themes of race, economic opportunity and the problems afflicting blue-collar workers that are crystallized in the city of Flint in an age of globalization.
Residents say that even though the water supply has now been switched back to Lake Huron, the damage done to piping in their homes and in the water infrastructure remains severe and they are forced to drink bottled water. Michigan officials are investigating the extent to which lead poisoning has harmed the residents, including children, amid reports of severe rashes, developmental issues and other problems consistent with lead poisoning.
The debate offered members of the audience directly affected by some of the local issues a chance to question the candidates.
LeeAnne Walters, one of the first people to alert authorities about the Flint water crisis after her children developed health problems, asked the candidates to promise that if they were elected president, they would require the removal of all lead service lines from public water systems in the United States.
Gene Kopf, father of 14-year-old Abigail Kopf, who was shot and badly injured in a rampage in Kalamazoo, posed a question about gun control.
More than a water crisis
Flint's problems are not limited to its water crisis.
The city has long been a symbol of economic blight and the human implications of the decline of large-scale industrial manufacturing following the loss of its GM car manufacturing plant. More than 41% of Flint's residents live below the poverty level, according to the U.S. Census.
When asked about the flight of blue-collar jobs from cities such as Flint, Clinton said she would "stop this kind of jobs exporting."
But Sanders hit back: "I am very glad ... that Secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue."
We were wrong for laughing at the Star Wars kid, and the guy who was reduced to tears by a double rainbow. Double light sabers and double rainbows are, in fact, as cool as they made them out to be.
We shamefully laughed at them, when we should have been swinging and weeping with them. And deep inside we knew that. We understood their passion but like a pimple-faced 15-year-old we bent to the pressure and applied ridicule.
Fuck that.
I'd be proud to cry at a sufficiently awesome double rainbow, and if someone laughs at me I'll slay him with a double-sided light saber-mop-handle thingy.
The next time you see this happening, grab a mop handle and help the one who's enjoying the rainbow–not the one laughing at him. ::
Baltimore city and county leaders announced Tuesday that they are committing a combined $280 million to fund construction of the Red Line light rail even as the estimated cost for the project has ballooned to $2.9 billion.
The local contributions are considered critical for the Woodlawn-to-East Baltimore transit line to proceed. As federal transportation funding has dwindled in recent years, officials prioritizing infrastructure improvements around the country have favored projects that include state and local cost sharing.
"Federal funding is not what it used to be," said Maryland Transportation Secretary James T. Smith. The city and county buy-in gives the state "the opportunity to demonstrate to Washington that, in fact, this is a major commitment for the local jurisdictions, that it will impact multiple jurisdictions."
State officials also said Tuesday that they plan to use a public-private partnership to help underwrite the cost of the project, which previously had an estimated price tag of about $2.65 billion. Under those arrangements, the private sector would provide construction funding in exchange for future contracts to operate and maintain the line.
The proposed 14.1-mile light rail line, part of which would be underground, has been in the works since 2011 and is projected to open in 2022.
Repeated increases in the Red Line's projected cost have been fodder for critics and were a sticking point for Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz as recently as last month, when he publicly challenged the state's handling of the project.
Henry Kay, the Maryland Transit Administration's executive director for transit development and delivery, said the increases were unexpected.
For example, the state must spend $58 million to build a stronger station in Fells Point after finding higher-than-anticipated underground water pressure. The state also found it must spend $30 million more to build a deeper tunnel under downtown after finding metal cables extending outward from the underground parking garage walls of 111 S. Calvert St., remnants from the Harborplace tower's construction.
Benjamin Rosenberg, a resident who lives near the proposed path of the Red Line and is a member of the Right Rail Coalition, which has argued for a more cost-efficient approach to public transit in the city, said recent cost increases show the state doesn't have a handle on them.
Rosenberg said he is concerned that taxpayers will be asked to pick up more of the cost if private partners do not come forward, and he expects more increases, particularly as the state starts boring the tunnel.
"Who knows what's down there?" he said.
But Kay said he does not expect further major cost increases because the state has completed about 65 percent of its design work for the Red Line and most of the underground work.
"The size of what we don't know is getting pretty small," he said.
Under the local commitments made Tuesday, the city plans to contribute $230 million, up from an initial request from the state for $200 million. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, a longtime proponent of the project, said the city's contribution would be made without raising taxes or introducing new fees for city residents.
"I'm excited about moving forward," Rawlings-Blake said. "I believe in the Red Line's ability to grow jobs and build Baltimore."
Kamenetz made the county commitment of $50 million in a letter to Smith. It represented a stark reversal from one month ago, when Kamenetz balked at the state's request for $50 million and said the county would contribute only $26.5 million, entirely through in-kind contributions such as paying for sidewalk construction.
In the letter to Smith, Kamenetz said the county would meet the $50 million request but reiterated his objections. He said county officials only learned in March that they would need to contribute cash.
The request came at time when the county's budget is strapped, Kamenetz said. The county has made "a substantial commitment" to increase its debt ratio to fund $1.1 billion in school construction, Kamenetz wrote.
"Thus, I continue to be disappointed that local governments are now expected to contribute to this project when that was never explained to us during any of the planning stages of the Red Line," he wrote.
Kamenetz declined to comment beyond the letter.
Smith said the state would continue to negotiate with the county — in part because it now wants to raise the county's contribution to $60 million. "We're going to have to talk about the additional $10 million, but that's certainly a doable conversation," Smith said.
Kay said state officials worked to persuade the city to contribute $30 million more to help cover the project's higher overall cost.
State law requires the two local jurisdictions to contribute 10 percent of the overall cost of the project. Local buy-in was a key selling point in attracting about $900 million in federal funding for the project, state officials said.
For years, the state has been working to build two large transit projects: the Red Line and the proposed Purple Line connecting Montgomery and Prince George's counties outside Washington. Both have been prioritized for federal funding, and the state has issued a request for proposals for public-private partnership bids on the estimated $2.4 billion Purple Line.
The state wants a private Purple Line partner to cover $500 million to $900 million in costs in exchange for a long-term contract to design, build, operate and maintain the system for 35 years.
State officials said the Red Line partnership would be more limited, in part because outsourcing the work would cost more because the state would have to pay a premium for a private entity to take on risks involved in boring the tunnel.
Still, the state now expects to rely more extensively on private investment not just for operation and maintenance but also design and construction.
The private partnership contribution would offset the cost of the project to the state, which is planning to cover the balance after local and federal contributions.
Kamenetz's proposal commits $17 million in in-kind contributions in 2016, including water and sewer line relocations and installing traffic signals, and the rest in cash payments starting with $5 million in 2018 and $5.6 million each year through 2023.
The Bible is very unique in that it seems to change depending on why you are reading it. No other book satisfies so many different needs. You can read Psalms to find exactly the right words to worship God in a thankful moment, you can become inspired by the rise and fall of people who are following their journey with God, and find strength in many different forms. When I am feeling lost or scared, I have gone to verses that keep me grounded.
This post may contain affiliate links, which I am compensated for when you click on one and make a purchase. Its no extra cost to you but helps support my coffee habit!
Here are 5 of my favorite strength inducing Bible verses:
1.) 1 Peter 1:6 “So be truly glad, there is wonderful joy ahead, even though you have to endure many trials for a little while.”
This always keeps things in perspective. Whatever I am going through will not last, and God has planned for these circumstances to stand in my way to change me for the better. Life can be hard, but it's only temporary. Whatever feels gigantic at this moment is temporary in the best way. Stay calm because God has an amazing gift you could not even begin to imagine held in your future.
2.) Philippians 4:6 “Turn your worries into prayer.”
Not only does this remind me that nothing is too big for God, it reminds me to take action when I am scared. Nothing makes a problem worse than sitting around just thinking about it. Let God help you carry whatever the burden is. Turn that fear and pain into prayer and allow yourself to become free from it.
3.) Esther 4:14 “Perhaps you were born for such a time as this.”
Esther is one of my favorite chapters of all time. Reading her story always makes me ask, what is this trial teaching me? Is my pain supposed to serve someone else? Am I meant to be able to inspire another person to persevere? Is this bigger than just my experience? How does this change my perspective so that I can change the world? God doesn't take away without creating something new, sometimes it just takes understanding that to be able to find the beauty in the worst of situations.
4.) Exodus 14:14 “The Lord himself will fight for you. Just stay calm.”
How much more calming could you get? To know that no matter how you feel at that moment, you are never truly alone. In his own time, God won't just send angels or adversaries. He will protect you and keep you safe. With that in my mind, I can accomplish anything. Who is stronger than the Lord? What problem would be too big for him to solve? Absolutely nothing. With that in mind, I cannot fail.
5.) Luke 1:37, “Faith does not make things easy, it makes things possible.”
Christians are blessed in many ways because of their relationship with God. However, I am supposed to struggle. Having to trust in God despite not knowing what will happen or choosing him when giving up is easy deepens my faith. Would this be worth it if it was too easy? Would accomplishing your dreams feel as good if you reached your goal the same day you set it? Set a goal, take action, work hard, pray often, and nothing can stop you.
A Texas-based chemical plant impacted by the flooding that came with Hurricane Harvey is now refusing to detail the location of its chemical inventory on site to the public as it anticipates more explosions.
Arkema Inc. has released a list of the chemicals on the site of its Crosby, Texas, plant but has not detailed the location of these chemicals or how they are stored, despite once promising to do so, the Houston Chronicle reported. As the company anticipates more explosions at the plant, more than 10,000 people have signed a petition asking Arkema to release the list “to either give residents some peace of mind or know the dangers that potentially face them,” according to NBC News.
However, the company cited “security reasons from a terrorism perspective” for not releasing the details.
This list — called a Tier II filing — is released every year to local, state and federal officials, and includes what they imagine could occur in a “worst-case” scenario, NBC News reported. A spokesperson for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality told the Chronicle that the company can release the details if someone made a public information request.
Last week, several explosions occurred and black smoke rose from the Crosby-based plant. Flood water has begun to recede, according to the company, which is monitoring the site with local authorities. On Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it has assessed data from the scene of the explosions. “This information indicates that there are no concentrations of concern for toxic materials reported at this time,” the EPA said.

RALEIGH, NC - Ron Francis, Executive Vice President and General Manager of the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes, today announced that the team has recalled forwards Patrick Brown and Andrej Nestrasil from the Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League (AHL). Brown and Nestrasil will join the Hurricanes for the team's game tonight at Tampa Bay.
Brown, 24, has notched 11 goals and earned nine assists (20 points) while playing in all 54 of the Checkers' games this season. The Bloomfield Hill, MI, native is in his third professional season after completing a four-year collegiate career at Boston College where he was a member of the Eagles' 2012 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championship team. Brown (6'1", 210 lbs.) signed with Carolina as a free agent following his collegiate career, and has scored one goal and earned one assist (2 points) in 14 career NHL games with the Hurricanes.
Nestrasil, 26, scored one goal and earned four assists (5 points) with the Hurricanes before being assigned to Charlotte on Jan. 10. In 18 games with the Checkers, the Prague native has notched four goals and earned six assists (10 points). Nestrasil (6'3", 200 lbs.) joined the Hurricanes on Nov. 20, 2014, when he was claimed on waivers from Detroit. He has scored 17 goals and earned 31 assists (48 points) in 127 career NHL games with Detroit and Carolina.
Fantasy Premier League armband tips for GW26
In the aftermath of Arsenal's capitulation at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday evening, it was inevitable that speculation would increase about the future of Arsene Wenger. However, it is the growing likelihood of star attacker Alexis Sánchez following Wenger out of the Emirates exit door that is far more alarming for Gunners' supporters.
The Chiliean attacker remains one of the leading contenders for the Golden Boot but in recent weeks he has cast a frustrated figure and the dejection he showed during the defeat in Germany was apparent for all to see. Only time will tell but it might be asking a lot for Sánchez to continue to produce the type of performances that have made him the standout 2016/17 fantasy player, between now and the end of the campaign.
When the first blank gameweek of the season takes place next weekend, Sánchez and his Arsenal teammates will not be in action due to Southampton's involvement in the EFL Cup Final. The Saints face Manchester United at Wembley, so the Manchester derby is the other postponed game. This has implications for Fantasy Premier League managers since they will only be able to score fantasy points with players from the 16 teams that will be in GW26 action, while also reducing the pool of players from which to select a captain. Zlatan Ibrahimović, fresh from is hat-trick against Saint Etienne, is another noticeable absentee.
Choosing your FPL captain for the first blank gameweek of the season
Diego Costa has failed to score or register an assist in his last three Premier League starts but that hasn't prevented him from coming out on top in our GW26 ‘Captometer' ratings, which factors in each teams' goals expectation and the contribution a player is expected to make to that total, in terms of goals and assists.
GW26 Contribution Expectancy (Goals & Assists) Player 0 1 2 3+ Diego Costa 31.32% 36.36% 21.10% 11.21% Romelu Lukaku 34.67% 36.73% 19.45% 9.15% Harry Kane 37.95% 36.77% 17.82% 7.47% Dele Alli 50.19% 34.60% 11.92% 3.29% Eden Hazard 50.58% 34.48% 11.75% 3.20% Christian Eriksen 51.75% 34.09% 11.23% 2.93% Son Heung-min 54.24% 33.18% 10.15% 2.43% Matt Phillips 58.90% 31.18% 8.25% 1.67% Sadio Mané 58.90% 31.18% 8.25% 1.67% Robert Snodgrass 60.65% 30.33% 7.58% 1.44% Adam Lallana 61.59% 29.85% 7.23% 1.32% Phillip Coutinho 62.27% 29.50% 6.99% 1.25% Jermain Defoe 62.34% 29.46% 6.96% 1.24% Álvaro Negredo 64.27% 28.41% 6.28% 1.04% Wilfried Zaha 64.31% 28.39% 6.26% 1.03% Islam Slimani 65.56% 27.68% 5.84% 0.92%
The Blues host Swansea City, who, despite climbing out of the relegation zone, have conceded more goals than any other Premier League side. This looks like the perfect opportunity for Costa to get back among the goals.
Everton's Romelu Lukaku has been troubled by a calf injury but he is expected to be passed fit for the Toffees' home match with Sunderland and bearing in mind that he scored 4 times on his last appearance at Goodison Park, he just cannot be ignored.
Sadio Mané could be a popular choice, following his man of the match performance against Spurs last time out and if he was to replicate that sort of form, he will surely push champions' Leicester City closer to the trap-door. Tottenham Hotspur will be looking to bounce back from that Anfield mauling when they entertain Stoke City at White Hart Lane and they have four players figuring prominently in the GW26 rankings.
Transfer activity should be kept on hold until this weekend's FA Cup ties have taken place, though. Any team that progresses to the next round will face another blank gameweek in GW28, so if all 8 Premier League teams get through, just three FPL fixtures would be scheduled for that round – now that would be the ultimate blank gameweek!

News Flash for Fox News: Canada Doesn't Need the US For Security
Canadian Lieutenant General Leslie Andrew Leslie recently noted that after Canada's deployment in Afghanistan ends in 2011, Canada's military may need a year to recover. The reason, as Ellen points out, is because Canada has been suffering 4 times the casualty rate of American troops in Afghanistan, because Canada's in one of the most dangerous provinces.
Of course, Fox panelist Benson then mocked Canadians:
“I didn't even know that they were in the war,” Benson said, adding he thought Canada was where someone went to avoid fighting.
No, Fox and the Republican party is where people go who avoid fighting. None of the panelists on the show appear to have ever served in the military.
Then Fox pundits made the suggestion that Canada leaches on the US for security:
“Would Canada be able to get away with this if they didn't share a border with the most powerful country in the universe?”
Here's a fact for Fox. There is only one country in the world which threatens Canada's security in any meaningful way. Only one country in the world which might be able to successfully invade Canada: that's the US.
Canada doesn't need the US to save it from anyone but the US. Sort of like protection money: “Such a nice country you have there. Be a shame if anything any happened to it.”
Which is more or less what one panelist meant when he said:
“Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country?” Gutfeld asked panelist Doug Benson.
I know many Americans don't think this way, but I get tired of the idea that Canada is some pacifist country. We joined both WWI and WWII sooner than Americans, and we took heavier losses per capita (see endnotes). Sure, we didn't fight in Vietnam or Iraq, but that's because neither country was any threat to us, or to our ally, the US. Fighting in unnecessary wars is deeply immoral and worse than being immoral is a mistake which weakens the countries which partake.
Why are we in Afghanistan and not Iraq? Because there is the least a case that Afghanistan harbored terrorists who attacked our NATO ally, the US. We're being a good ally. There was no credible evidence that Iraq was involved in 9/11, and we don't believe that when Fred hits you, you should attack Mary instead just because you don't like Mary and always wanted to beat her bloody.
For many years I have believed that Canada needs to revamp its military. Not to make it more of an expeditionary force, but to make it serve Canadians better. The main arm should be the Navy, supported by the Air Force, so we can defend our territorial waters. As for our army, they should be trained in insurgency/counter-insurgency. Officially, of course, the military upgrade would be so we could fight the colonial wars we keep getting dragged into by our entangling alliances. Unofficially the real reason would be because after Iraq, only a fool thinks the US isn't one demagogic politician and one disaster away from invading anyone it pleases, whether there's any good reason or not. Sound ridiculous? Well, 8 years ago would you have thought that if country X attacked the US, the US would use that as an excuse to attack country Y? Ridiculous is no longer a valid counterargument. The US was a rogue nation under Bush, I can see no reason to think it couldn't happen again. And Canada has a lot of oil.
If the US invades, Canada can't beat it on the open battlefield. But Canada is a big place, perfectly designed for guerrilla warfare.
But really, Canada and the US have been allies and friends for a long time, and I'm proud we've helped in Afghanistan. Hopefully relations will stay good. But when Fox is the top viewed news network in a country and spewing this sort of hate, one sometimes wonders.
(Hat tip to Newshounds for the Fox News video above.)
Endnotes:
In WWII Canada had 1.1 million men serving and lost 45,364. The total population of the country in 1945 was 12,072,000. Canada thus had a per capita loss rate of .376%. America's death rate in WWII was .21%.
In WWI Canada had 64,944 military casualties in a total population of 7.2 million. The per capita death rate was thus a wopping 0.9%. The US lost 53,402, in absolute numbers less, and the casualty rate was .054%.
In WWI the US entered the war on April 6th, 1917. Canada had been at war since August 14th, 1914. (Granted, Canada had no choice in the matter as it had to go to war when Britain did, but it didn't have to send as many men as it did. Granted, also, that there's a strong argument that the US should not have entered WWI, which was not a war about any great principles or against any great evil, despite the propaganda at the time.)

Verdict
Early in his tenure, it seemed like the San Francisco 49ers had really hit a home run in choosingto be their general manager. After all, the first draft he solely presided upon in 2011 was stellar, and produced impact players such asandHowever, while Baalke does deserve a lot of credit for that class, he seems to have struggled to live up those standards since. In fact, looking at the 49ers' selections in recent years, it may be fair to wonder if Baalke was a one trick pony.Looking at the approach here, you can only assume the team expected to go in a different direction on offense, and possibly run more of a spread attack at some point. The issue was they didn't have the personnel to really do that, and the guys they drafted couldn't play anyway.Jenkins will go down as one of the biggest busts in 49ers' history, and only lasted a single season before being shipped out. He never caught a pass in red and gold. James showed some flashes, but ultimately was a bad fit and now seems like a huge reach in the second round. Even Looney, who did start four games last year, was let go in favor of some pretty sub par offensive lineman prior to this season.All in all, no one is left from the 2012 class, and while the Niners were able to absorb the blow initially, missing on so many players then is hurting them in the long run.Reid and Dial are the exceptions to a draft class that looked good on paper, but is yet to really produce any significant dividends. Reid is a solid starter who made a Pro Bowl, but he's struggled in coverage this year without a strong front seven. Dial was terrific value for where he was taken, considering he's now a starter at defensive end.If you're looking for the real sore spot here, look no further than the second round. Carradine was coming off an ACL injury, but the thought was he would eventually be the guy to replace. After being redshirted in year one (a common theme with Baalke draft picks) and barely seeing the field in year two, Carradine is nothing more than a rotational defensive lineman at this point.As far as McDonald, the Niners desperately needed a second tight end to pair withMuch of their success on offense had to do with being able to get creative in two-tight end sets with Davis and. With options likeandstill on the board, Baalke absolutely whiffed by going with McDonald. In a little over two seasons, the disappointing tight end has been targeted 29 times in 25 games, and has only caught 11 balls (38 percent). He's never caught more than one pass in any game, and never scored a touchdown. His playing time has decreased, and it's a long shot he'll be around after this season.As far as the rest of this group, Patton has been an underachiever (11 career receptions) and Lattimore was another ACL special that didn't pan out. Lemonier is still with the team but doesn't appear to be anything more than a backup.When you look at the names here, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that this class could make or break Baalke. The reason I say that is because so many of these selections are playing significant snaps in 2015 (or were expected to), although we're not sure if any of them will really have an impact in the long run.While Ward might ultimately shift to safety at some point, he's been a major disappointment in the nickel corner role in the 11 games he's played thus far. Martin is currently the starting center, but has been abysmal. He's sporting a negative-11.5 grade according to Pro Football Focus. Thomas was expected to be in the competition at right guard after sitting out 2014 with a knee injury (sound familiar?), but right now he can't even beat outwho the team acquired in August. Borland looked like a gem, but, well...you know.Johnson, Acker and Reaser all appear to be promising corners, but with little support around them, it's tough to judge. Can you really go into a season with that much inexperience at the cornerback position and expect to be successful without a strong pass rush?Ellington has found it hard to stay on the field, but is bursting with potential. Lynch was a steal on the fifth round, and has seven career sacks. Unfortunately, while he may be the team's best pass rusher, it's unfair to ask someone so young to carry that load.The real bright spot here though is Hyde, who is currently Pro Football Focus' top ranked running back. Hyde looks like he can be a workhorse back and a star (if he can only get some blocking up front).Looking at the evidence, I don't think the book has been completely written on Baalke yet, but I'm not sure the ending will be a happy one The 2012 and 2013 drafts set the 49ers back, no question, although 2014 has promise and could still go either way (obviously it's too early to tell on 2015). What worries me most is that while Baalke has drafted a number of "starters," he really hasn't brought in any Pro Bowl level players since 2011. You can make arguments for Reid and Hyde, but the former seems to be regressing and the latter just hasn't played enough yet.As the season progresses, many of Baalke's picks are going to have to show they are players who can be part of the solution, not part of the problem. If not, it might be time for a complete overhaul in San Francisco.Al Sacco has covered the 49ers for various sites over the years.

Jerusalem (AFP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he backed a bill limiting the volume of calls to prayer from mosques, a proposal government watchdogs have called a threat to religious freedom.
Netanyahu, speaking before a ministerial committee adopted the draft bill, said he would support such a move that some have labelled unnecessarily divisive.
The bill now faces three readings in parliament before becoming law.
Israeli media reported that the bill would stop the use of public address systems for calls to prayer.
"I cannot count the times -- they are simply too numerous -- that citizens have turned to me from all parts of Israeli society, from all religions, with complaints about the noise and suffering caused them by the excessive noise coming to them from the public address systems of houses of prayer," Netanyahu said at the start of a cabinet meeting.
While the draft bill applies to all houses of worship, it is seen as specifically targeting mosques.
Israel's population is roughly 17.5 percent Arab, most of them Muslim, and they accuse the Jewish majority of badly discriminating against them.
East Jerusalem is also mainly Palestinian and traditional calls to prayer by muezzins through PA systems can be heard in the city.
The Israel Democracy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, has spoken out against the proposal.
On Sunday, one of the watchdog's officials accused Israel's right-wing politicians of dangerously using the issue to gain political points under the guise of improving quality of life.
Nasreen Hadad Haj-Yahya wrote in Israeli newspaper Maariv that "the real aim" of the bill "is not to prevent noise, but rather to create noise that will hurt all society and the efforts to establish a sane reality between Jews and Arabs".
Netanyahu heads what is seen as the most right-wing government in Israeli history.

There's a phishing scam that has made its way into email inboxes across Greater Cincinnati. It's well-timed because it asks for W-2s and personal information as people rush to file their taxes. We spoke with a tech expert who said the problem only seems to be spreading. Chris Huntington with Nexigen, a tech security firm in Newport, said at least 100 of his clients around Cincinnati have been reporting these W-2 scam emails for weeks. He shared what we should all be watching for. When it comes to tax time, many of us have little patience. "It's just a lot to think about. That's why I have a CPA who takes care of my taxes," John Garcia said. Some can't get the necessary forms fast enough. "It's a little annoying to wait for the forms sometimes, especially with us having to pay back our loans and stuff. We'd like to file our taxes earlier," Emerlee Anderson said. Huntington said it's time for all of us to pay extra attention to securing our tax documents and information. "We've seen over 100 clients call in asking about this email," he said. He said a W-2 scam popping up in inboxes across the nation is also here at home. "Either asking the company for W-2 information or asking them to click on a link and fill out an update to their information to get their W-2 corrected," he said. He said the phishing scam emails look official and can come to you, your human resources department at work or others with access to W-2s. Huntington said in at least one case, an HR official emailed dozens of W-2s. The links can also download malware. "People are losing their identities, people are finding there are credit cards that are set up in their name and that tax returns have already been filed for them and a refund already processed," Huntington said. But he said you can fight back. Huntington said you should verify everything, call the sender on the phone, check the sender's email address, don't click any links and never email W-2s. He said you will typically notice spam emails coming from addresses where free email accounts can be made, like at Yahoo.com or Hotmail.com. Huntington said the emails will not come from your official company address. Another red flag is poor grammar in the text of the email. It's advice many will be passing along. "I probably wouldn't even open it. Straight to my spam or you know, trash can. It's just a little too shady," Garcia said. Huntington said Nexigen also simulated the email with its clients. It found about 10 percent of people clicked the link to give over information or download malware. The company is working with clients to teach their employees how to avoid compromising themselves and their workplaces.

Off-grid generators – am I asking too much?
Mark Walker analyses what you will need from a generator when going off the grid
Here I am living in semi-rural suburbia, concerned about the environment my children will inherit and frustrated by electricity bill increases and irritated by supply reliability. It's time for me to take my three bedroom semi-detached house ‘off-grid'. But to me, ‘off grid' isn't just about the removal of or lacking an electrical connection. I also want independence – from government policies and legislation, big multi-nationals, dealerships, service organisations, in fact, anybody. So how do I do this?
Having learnt the hard way that off-grid power generation requires a machine much more robust than those air-cooled, high speed, super-silent (yeah, right!) things found on eBay, I realised that I would have to set my budget sensibly. My strategy was to go for a name that has a reputation of longevity and reliability, putting me in the $1000+ per kilowatt league occupied by Honda, Yanmar and Kubota.
Would I be happy with such an investment? Of course I would — its state of the art technology, but there are a few things/features that they don't give me.
For example, I want a generator that has re-useable filters (air, oil and fuel) that just need cleaning. I don't want to have to pay excessive amounts of money to these multi-national companies for something that increases global pollution. It's just not necessary. Am I asking too much?
I want a generator that is cheap (very) to service. I want it to be so simple that I could do it myself, or at least simple enough for a local mechanic to do it. I don't want to be forced to use an approved Kubota service Engineer because I fear losing my (very impressive) warranty.
I want a generator with an engine so simple that I could strip the top end down myself, replace the valves, lap them in, all in my lunch hour and still have time to eat my sandwiches. Am I asking too much?
I want a generator that tells me it is well, just by the way it performs. I don't want a CAN bus ECU refusing to attempt to start the generator because it has detected a fault #73669-b with the instruction “call your nearest dealership immediately” only to be billed a $100 call out charge to discover that my starting battery has reached the end of its life. I would have diagnosed that myself from the sound of the machine. Am I asking too much?
I want a generator that has been designed to last as long as possible – like they used to design things before the 1970s (when they discovered that ‘built in obsolescence' is great for repeat business). I don't want a machine whose components are all designed to fail simultaneously 13.45 seconds after the (very impressive) warranty expires. Am I asking too much?
Do I really need a three-cylinder engine that will give me a perfect sine wave (with its associated additional service/parts costs)? My washing machine can cope with an imperfect sine wave (some can't), my lights are all compact fluorescent, so they don't care and my laptop will run on any quality electricity supply.
I want to pay less for my generator. If it was a single cylinder engine, it would be cheaper to make (and service) and more efficient. If it was made from cast iron it would be more efficient (conducts heat much less than aluminium), but no, the multinational engine manufacturers are obsessed with power density, so we have to have aluminium engines requiring us to pay more to Bosch to optimise their fuel systems so that compromise in efficiency caused by using aluminium is minimised.
I don't care how much my generator weighs. Once it's installed, I won't be moving it. Do they think I want to take it for a walk every time the sun comes out? Does anybody care how much their central heating boiler weighs?
I want to be able to run my generator on different fuels, and not lose my warranty. The pub up my road still has to pay for their waste cooking oil to be taken away. I want to save us both some money and reduce both our carbon footprints by putting that waste cooking oil in my generator. Am I asking too much?
Why do I have to pay so much for my engine oil? I want to use that really cheap stuff from my supermarket. But no! In order for me to keep my treasured warranty, I have to use an extortionately expensive lubrication oil – so full of toxic additives that I have to pay again to have it disposed of safely.
I want to use a simple oil and after I've used it, I want to let the dirt settle and throw the clean stuff in my fuel tank with my WVO, diesel, kerosene, paraffin or whatever. Am I asking too much?
I want to be able to use the waste heat from my generator. With domestic sized generators, at least 70% of the calorific content of my valuable fuel goes to heat up the atmosphere. I don't want to do that.
Did you know that the amount of heat dumped into the UK atmosphere whilst generating electricity is equivalent to half the nation's heating demand? The amount of heat dumped into the atmosphere by US power stations is enough to meet the entire heating needs of Japan. I don't want to be a part of that!
I did some digging around and asked a few Generator manufacturers (who claimed they offered Combined Heat and Power systems) if they could help. They said ‘no'; it's not cost effective to build domestic scale CHP systems. Really!? Why!? It's not rocket science! All I want is a heat exchanger that takes hot gases and puts the heat into water. That's what a domestic boiler does and they've been around for half a century.
I can buy a ‘state of the art' boiler for $1000. My annual heating costs are $1500. If my generator can provide my heating for free (as a by-product of generating electricity), which it can in theory, this little heat exchanger feature would pay for itself in 9 months. In what way is that not cost effective!?
Am I really, really asking too much? Apparently ‘yes', so I'm going to build my own. Anybody wants one?

Carb-Loaded: A Culture Dying to Eat is a documentary film being produced by Lathe Poland and Eric Carlsen. The film will explore the exploding diabetes epidemic. Not by coincidence, Lathe was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2010. He always thought of himself as a healthy eater. He rarely ate sweets, never drank soda, and had no family history of diabetes. Why would a seemingly healthy thirty-something like Lathe get a disease like this? The misconception that he had, like many people, was that diabetes is either hereditary and it's not your fault, or you eat junk food like it's going out of style and you end up diabetic.
"According to The Journal Pediatrics, pre-diabetes and diabetes cases in children ages 12-19, grew from 9% in the year 2000 to 23% in 2008."
Is our lifestyle, culture, or food ecosystem enabling the sky-rocketing increase in diabetes and obesity? Or is it the catalyst? More importantly, can this wave of momentum be reversed? These are the questions that will be answered in the film Carb-Loaded: A Culture Dying to Eat. Leading nutrition scientists, doctors and researchers will weigh in on this unparalleled epidemic. Additionally, the film will explore our connection to a food culture that may be responsible for the most expensive healthcare crisis in modern memory.

Supplier delivered product extremely fast! Purchased Judy and dressed her up as nurse; family member having surgery and thought this is better than flowers! Unfortunately, Judy had slow leak that evening and next morning I planned to take her to hospital and her leak was very big. Supplier did send patch, but didn't help. No pins, etc used for her clothing. Did attempt to put her in chair (gently) but guess not gentle enough -- thinking the small bend probably popped her even though she had some room for the air to move (wasn't blown up tightly). Did not contact supplier, as didn't have time to exchange, etc. Didn't get home until late the night she was delivered and had to get up early next AM to get her to hospital.
The gay marriage bill has been saved after Ed Miliband agreed at the last minute to vote against an amendment to extend civil partnerships to heterosexual couples that had prompted government warnings that it would derail the entire measure.
The Labour leader, who had planned to abstain in a Commons vote on the amendment, agreed to change tack after the government chief whip Sir George Young sent a message to his opposition counterparts that the Tory leadership was facing defeat.
The move meant that the amendment, tabled by the anti-gay marriage Tory, former children's minister Tim Loughton, was defeated by 375 to 70 votes, a majority of 305.
The decision by the Labour leadership, which has gone from supporting the amendment on civil partnerships to rejecting it within the space of 24 hours, means that the marriage (same-sex couples) bill will now experience a safer journey through parliament.
The government had warned earlier in the day that the Loughton amendment would have threatened the entire bill by adding £4bn to the costs and delaying its implementation. The costs would have come from increased pension survivor rates for new civil partners.
Labour sources said that the party, which had announced earlier in the day that it would abstain on the Loughton amendment after overnight warnings from the government about the threat to bill, denied that Miliband had embarked on a double U-turn.
One source said: "We had an eleventh hour appeal from the government that they did not have the numbers to defeat the Tim Loughton amendment. They made repeated approaches to us at ever increasing levels.
"Ed's overriding priority is to ensure that the bill gets on to the statute book. Ed and Yvette Cooper will therefore be voting against the Tim Loughton amendment. We expect a large number of MPs to join Ed and Yvette. Since there was a genuine threat to the bill Ed decided the best thing to do was to act in this way."
The appeal by Tory whips for Labour support to ensure the safety of the bill highlighted deep divisions in the Conservative party in the wake of claims that a senior member of his entourage described party activists as "swivel-eyed". Lord Feldman, the Tory co-chairman, denied making the remarks.
More than 100 Tory MPs planned to register their opposition to the marriage (same-sex couples) bill by voting in favour of a series of amendments to water down the measure. In the first vote of the evening, more than 150 MPs voted in favour of an amendment that would allow registrars to refuse to perform same-sex ceremonies.
Tory opponents of the bill were alarmed when Labour and the Tories embarked on negotiations during the day. The government agreed during the day to a Labour request to amend its own plans by launching an immediate review into extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples.
Maria Miller, the equalities minister, agreed to the Labour request. But she suggested that the review could lead to the end of civil partnerships when she said the review will see "if there is a demand for [civil partnerships]".
The deal meant that the government amendment, altered by Labour, was approved by 391 to 57 votes, a majority of 334.
But Labour initially said that it would abstain on the Loughton amendment on the grounds that it agreed with it but did not want to risk the overall bill.
The leaders of all the main parties offered all their MPs, including ministers and shadow ministers, a free votes on the grounds that marriage is a "conscience" social issue in which the party whips have no official say. But the prime minister devoted government time to the gay marriage legislation in the belief that it would help reach out to centre ground voters who may feel uncomfortable about supporting a party whose leader voted in favour of the retention of section 28 as recently as ten years ago.
The divisions among Tories was highlighted when Sir Gerald Howarth, knighted on the advice of the prime minister last year when he sacked him as a defence minister, warned of an "aggressive homosexual community" during a clash with a member of Cameron's policy board. Howarth made the remarks when Margot James, a fellow Tory MP who is in a civil partnership and who was recently appointed to the new Conservative policy board, said that the equal marriage legislation would level the playing field after gay people suffered discrimination in the 1980s.
Howarth replied: "I warn you, and MPs on all sides of the house, that I fear that the playing field has not been levelled. I believe that the pendulum is now swinging so far the other way and there are plenty in the aggressive homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something even further."
In creepy international news, there's an art installation in Ukraine that doubles as a matchmaking service. "Oooo," all you current and former art history students might say, "I enjoy art and maybe it'd be cool to meet someone who obviously shares my interests." (At least, that's what you'd say if you've never seen Dress to Kill and knew that only bad things happen after an art museum rendezvous.) Well, this Ukrainian art installation isn't quite like that — it features sleeping women (or women who are artfully feigning sleep), all of them waiting patiently for kisses that will rouse them from their torpor. If they are kissed awake, they are contractually obligated to marry the kisser. For real.
The installation, hosted by the National Art Museum of Ukraine, will go on for three nail-biting days, during which viewers can stroll right up to the sleeping women and creepily watch and breathe heavily all over them. It's gross. Nobody is obligated to kiss (or to "wake" from a kiss), but, viewers and exhibits alike have signed contracts stipulating that, if a proffered kiss does induce an awakening, the two parties will get married. According to Ukrainian-Canadian artist Taras Polataiko, the exhibit's organizer, nobody is obligated to kiss, but every kiss carries the very real possibility of immediate and legally binding matrimony:
Everybody, any viewer, will have to sign the contract, which says if – this is very important, because nobody has to – 'if I kiss the beauty and she opens her eyes while being kissed, I marry her.'
Sleeping women were chosen earlier in August. Polataiko told the Telegraph that, in creating the exhibit, he'd hoped that someone would find "a real love connection," which might well happen, especially if certain participants are particularly susceptible to the idea of serendipity or the narrative structure of fairy tales. It's probably not a bad way for the acutely lazy to meet, either, because who really wants to go through the trouble of meeting and talking to some stranger when you can simply repose and wait for that perfect someone who has the freshest breath and the least-chapped lips to steal your heart?

TOKYO — The factory night-view cruise is luring crowds away from the city.
The brainchild of the Kawasaki City Office and the Kawasaki City Tourist Association, the twice-monthly factory night-cruise tours began in January and use the city's Keihin industrial zone as a sightseeing attraction.
On one recent tour, participants gazed in wonder at the factories bathed in orange and white lights that snaked along the coastline facing Tokyo Bay.
“It's cool!” and “It's just like a Christmas tree!” they
said.
With furnaces billowing white smoke, and elaborate systems of pipes and spiraling staircases, the factories at night resembled giant creatures.
The accompanying light and sound show — the ordinary running of the factory — evoked scenes from science-fiction movies.
Despite being blasted by the cold sea air, the participants stayed above deck for more than an hour.
Women make up about 70 percent of tour participants.
“There're lots of shapes and colors that can't be seen on streets. I'm enjoying this because I feel as if I've escaped from daily life,” said first-time participant Nao Tanigawa, feverishly taking photographs.
“I think female participants enjoy the mystique of the factories, which they are not very familiar with, as a night cruise spot,” said Yasuyuki Kameyama, head of the Kawasaki City Tourist Association's sightseeing promotion department.
The company's tours attract a large number of participants, and a bus tour that began in April also is very popular.
A Yokohama tour operator has begun a similar tour.
Organized by Marine Tourist Co., headquartered in Naka Ward, Yokohama, the company said its daytime tours also had proved popular.
“These tours win over people who are perhaps jaded with ordinary sightseeing, as they can enjoy exploring something new and seeing something they can't usually see,” said Marine Tourist president Eiichi Mitsuzaki.
The sprawling industrial zones of Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, and Kitakyushu also have begun factory tours.
The boom in factory viewing can perhaps be traced to a best-selling book, Kojo Moe (Factory Love), by photographer Tetsu Ishii. It sold about 40,000 copies.
Ishii stressed it is the factories' functionality that makes them so attractive.
The factories “were not built for their appearance. Every detail involved plays a role. That's why they're beautiful,” he said.
He said he became interested in the relationship between factories and cities of the future after watching the science-fiction movie Blade Runner when he was a high school student.
When he wrote about how he felt about factories on the Internet, he received many responses from those with similar feelings.
“I think the idea of factories being ugly and spewing pollution has weakened, and a new age — in which we can say, ‘We like factories!' — has arrived,” Ishii said.
Meanwhile, workers at such factories wonder what the fuss and attraction is about.
“I'm in a factory all the time. I don't see why it's so interesting,” said Takanobu Sato, 58, a section chief at the Kawasaki-based Toa Oil Co.
“But for us, for employees of a company that doesn't make products under its own name, it gives us great pleasure to hear people view [our factories] in this way,” he said.

Women's football trailblazer Susan Alberti steps down as Western Bulldogs vice-president
Updated
One of the most influential women in the AFL, Susan Alberti, is stepping down as vice-president of reigning premiers the Western Bulldogs, but has promised she will continue to help break ground for the women's competition.
Ms Alberti said she was "retiring" from the board after coming to the end of her "fourth term in office", the maximum allowed at the club.
"It's time to hand the baton on and I'm going to get involved in other things, particularly women's football," she said.
"We won the premiership, we won the VFL premiership, we couldn't be in a better position and I'm going out on a high."
In one of the best moments in sport this year, the Bulldogs ended their 62-year premiership drought with a win over Sydney, and their successful run to the flag captured the hearts of neutral fans across the country.
Ms Alberti has supported the Bulldogs for 60 years. As a philanthropist, she has donated millions of dollars to medical research.
She has also given significant amounts to help prop up the women's football competition over the past decade and was a powerful driver behind the AFL's new national women's league.
Ms Alberti said there was "no doubt" her involvement in football had cleared a path for women who wanted to be involved in the game.
"I've been very vocal about women in football and I believe it is reverberating around the other clubs," she said.
"I want to see a women's team at every club. Playing football is not a privilege, it's a right."
Ms Alberti was also a key player in keeping the Bulldogs afloat, along with president Peter Gordon, when they were in financial dire straits during the 1990s.
"Things were drastic," she said.
She said she was not stepping away from football altogether and would still be involved with the Western Bulldogs.
"I'm interested in following women in football, I know a lot of young women who are playing in the competition and they confide in me, and I'll support them in anyway I can," she said.

Are the two major political parties in America trading places, in demographic terms? Are Republicans becoming a populist party of the downtrodden and disenfranchised, while Democrats become the political home of the up-market urban elites? That may seem like too big a leap amid the intense divisions of 2016, when the Donald Trump distortion effect has so thoroughly warped the political landscape. But such a phase-shift has happened before, and there's considerable evidence that it's happening again.
Now that the aftermath of the political conventions has settled down and Trump's campaign of self-sabotage has shifted into a new and spectacular gear, we once again confront the possibility that Trump himself will be nothing more than a bizarre footnote to the story of this extraordinary year. In his own limited and vainglorious fashion, Trump understands that: “I am your voice,” he told the GOP gathering in Cleveland. He is a ludicrous outrider of the apocalypse, not the thing itself. From here, it looks like our nation is on the verge of a political meltdown, and a political realignment, whose long-term consequences are unknowable.

I have a message for Democrats who look at Trump's sliding poll numbers, in the wake of the Khan family feud and “Obama is the founder of ISIS” and “let's try Americans at Gitmo,” and tell themselves that the nightmare is almost over and everything will soon return to normal. You are whistling past the graveyard. Hillary Clinton will very likely win this election, and it could end up as a blowout, although I'd be reluctant to bet the ranch on that. But what kind of "normal" are you so happy about? The paralysis and dysfunction of the entire last decade? To pretend that such an outcome — the candidate who is widely disliked and mistrusted defeating the candidate who is widely feared and despised — does anything at all to address the structural and ideological crisis that is eating away at both parties and the bipartisan system represents an epic level of denial.
You know who you are, oh nice people who feel vaguely wounded right about now! Despite the Bernie Sanders insurrection and the fact that the Democratic Party has been electorally eviscerated between the coasts and has hit a historic low point in terms of voter self-identification, you have somehow convinced yourselves that nothing fundamental has gone wrong and it will all be OK. I mean, yours is the party of good government and rational foreign policy and tolerance and diversity, right? Once you get past this unexpectedly ugly (and unexpectedly disturbing) election and park Hillary in the White House, the future is secure.
Just because the news cycle will be almost exclusively occupied with Trump and Clinton for the next 11 weeks, and one of them will apparently end up as president, it doesn't follow that they're the most important people on the stage. Clinton's supposedly major economic address this week was especially awkward: She did her best to finesse her way around an entire career of supporting free trade, globalization and financial deregulation, in a year when those things have suddenly become toxic. No one should ever believe the vague economic promises made by presidential candidates, but even by those standards Clinton's second-rate Bernie Sanders ventriloquist act was unconvincing.
The conventions I recently attended in Cleveland and Philadelphia reflected parallel institutions in different stages of internal decay and discord. Both were profoundly troubled events, dedicated to fending off certain unpleasant aspects of reality. The real protagonist of 2016 has been the American electorate, which was confronted with a set of unpalatable choices and has made a series of decisions that may have been incoherent or self-destructive but were not entirely irrational. It has expressed its widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo, at the very least, although there's nothing even close to a collective sense of what to do about it.
From the beginning of this electoral cycle, I've been fascinated by two emerging and interconnected phenomena, both of which are essential to making sense of this crazy year. One is that the Republican Party has suffered an ideological implosion, despite its near-total stranglehold on Capitol Hill, and that the Democratic Party is not far behind. The other is that the Sanders and Trump movements, despite their opposing ideologies, share a perspective on the oligarchic nature of power in America and have exposed what Lenin identified a century ago as a central contradiction of “bourgeois democracy.”
Capitalist society, the Bolshevik founder observed, produces a “liberal” understanding of individual rights and tends toward legal and political equality for all its citizens — equality in the marketplace, in other words. Along with that comes the implication, and often the direct promise, that such marketplace equality will ultimately produce greater levels of social and economic equality as well. But the opposite is true; the two species of equality are in opposition, not in harmony. Unfettered market capitalism concentrates economic power in the hands of a few and dramatically worsens inequality, producing an atmosphere of political and economic crisis that Lenin would have called a “revolutionary situation.”

There's no Leninist “vanguard party” in place to take advantage of such a situation (whatever they may claim on Fox News), nor am I advocating such an approach. What we have instead been two political parties in profound crisis. One of them has been compelled, however reluctantly, to confront the fact that its electoral coalition has collapsed and that its downscale white voters and zillionaire corporate funders have entirely different desires and goals. The other one is simultaneously in better shape and worse shape: It has won electoral pluralities in five of the last six presidential elections, which has allowed it to ignore the crisis or pretend it doesn't exist.
Hillary Clinton and her wing of the Democratic Party represent Lenin's contradiction, and still deny that it's a contradiction. They stand for women's rights and LGBT rights and combating “systemic racism,” and there's no reason to doubt their sincerity. But as Thomas B. Edsall wrote in the New York Times this week, the Democrats are no longer a “class-based coalition” with an economic agenda, but a loose coalition of “upscale well-educated whites” and African-American and Latino voters in big cities. They are the party of many flavors, all of them for sale at Whole Foods. Some connection is assumed between the culture-war and identity-politics issues at the heart of the party's current identity and universal economic progress, but how that connection might work in practice remains unclear and essentially metaphysical.
Edsall's column flew through the political discourse almost unnoticed; it had nothing to do with Trump's outsize personality or his outrageous utterances. But it might be the single most far-reaching journalistic analysis of this mad summer season. There has been a total “class inversion” among white Democratic voters, Edsall writes, since the era when Hillary Clinton's husband ran for president. In 1992, Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush by large margins among voters making less than $50,000 a year and among those with high school educations or less. Bush won narrowly among college-educated voters, and carried those making $100,000 or more by 16 points.
In an Aug. 1 CNN poll of this year's Trump-Clinton race, that 1992 situation has been turned upside down: Clinton wins 57 percent of college grads and 55 percent of voters with incomes above $50,000. She and Trump are in a statistical dead heat among less affluent voters and those without college degrees, and it's safe to conclude that Trump is far ahead among whites in those categories. I can feel Democratic loyalists converging around the idea that racism and xenophobia are the primary factors, and perhaps the only factors, driving support for Trump among working-class white Americans, and that the sense of dislocation and disenfranchisement those people feel is either imaginary or irrational.

No one should discount the role that bigotry has played in this election. Republicans have preyed on racial fears and culture-war conflicts for decades, and the Trump campaign has forced those issues to the surface. Racial resentment and flag-waving jingoism are the unifying flavors in Trump's secret sauce. But were poorer white Americans less racist 24 years ago, when most of them voted for Bill Clinton? Blaming downscale whites for retreating into prejudice is a transparent effort to evade the fact that the Clinton New Democrats gutted the FDR welfare state (“the era of big government is over,” Bill told us) and “abdicated too easily to market fundamentalism,” in the words of Harvard scholar Dani Rodrik.
But the Democrats' predicament goes beyond the fact that they jettisoned class-based economic populism in favor of a whole package of free-market policies aimed at liberating the global flow of investment capital, and that the carnage of that Bill Clinton-era decision is all around us. As Edsall says, the party is becoming “increasingly dependent on a white upper middle class that has isolated itself from the rest of American society.” That's what I perceived in Philadelphia: a party with an agreeable multicultural roster, pathologically devoted to the proposition that nothing was wrong with America that a little sensitivity training and Kombucha can't fix. If Trump voters perceive the Democrats as “the party of the winners,” a cosmopolitan coastal coalition with no cultural, geographical or social connection to working-class America, they have a point.
If the party of the winners is likely to win this November, largely by default, the question of what lies ahead is murkier. Partisan reversals and inversions are hardly unknown. As we know from history, the Democrats were the pro-slavery party (or at least the non-anti-slavery party) in the 19th century, and the white supremacy party well into the 20th. They represented the “less educated” — the white immigrant working classes in the North, white farmers and small business proprietors in the South.

Republicans, on the other hand, were the party of the affluent Northern elite and Midwestern middle-class Protestants; they were “liberal” on trade and economic policies (as opposed to protectionist or interventionist) and at least theoretically supportive of women's rights and civil rights. Until at least the Great Depression, the small proportion of black Americans who were allowed to vote almost unanimously supported the party of Lincoln. It's not coincidental that the first woman to be elected to both houses of Congress (Margaret Chase Smith) and the first African-American elected to the Senate (Edward Brooke) were both New England Republicans.
Democrats shed the white South some decades ago, and have almost completely absorbed the old Northeastern Republican establishment. You could argue that Hillary Clinton's Democratic Party effectively is the old Republican Party, translated into the cultural and demographic terms of the 21st century. That has left an immense political vacuum at the bottom end of the socioeconomic ladder, where left-wing populism and right-wing populism — Bernie Sanders socialism and Donald Trump nationalism — will fight for the future.
Hillary Clinton's economic ventriloquism can't fill that vacuum, and the unanswered question is whether the Republican Party can reconfigure itself as a new version of the old Democrats, with the racism and xenophobia damped down a little. The real danger that lies beneath Trump's Republican revolution is not Trump himself, but the more adroit figure -- the less Trumpian Trump -- who is sure to follow.

It never seems to be a hard knock life for Justin Timberlake, which is why he might be perfect to play Daddy Warbucks.
Ever the busy man, Timberlake drops his third studio album on Tuesday, and already has multiple films lined up for 2013. He stars in the Coen brothers' new film, "Inside Llewyn Davis," and is also set to appear with Ben Affleck in "Runner, Runner." Timberlake is also rumored for a starring role in "The Last Drop."
Timberlake would be playing Daddy Warbucks to Oscar-nominated 9-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis, who has been cast as the little orphan Annie in the upcoming film. The role is now her second project since her celebrated role in 2012's "Beasts of the Southern Wild." The youngster is also filming "Twelve Years a Slave" with Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Michael Fassbender.
“With the recent Academy Award nomination and critical acclaim, Quvenzhané Wallis is a true star and we believe her portrayal as Annie will make her a true worldwide star," President of production for Columbia Hannah Minghella said in a statement when her casting was announced. "She is an extraordinary young talent with an amazing range, not only as an actress but as a singer and dancer, and we can't wait for audiences to further discover her.”
"Annie" is due out in the fall of 2014.
This takes at least one of Wall Street's big concerns about Discovery off the table. The programmer and Comcast say this morning that they've reached a “long-term, comprehensive renewal” agreement for the No. 1 cable company to carry Discovery's 12 U.S. networks.
They didn't disclose financial terms. But the deal includes TV Everywhere rights so Comcast subscribers can stream the Discovery-owned channels both in and out of home.
Many Discovery watchers wondered whether Comcast might use the contract renewal negotiations to retaliate after CEO David Zaslav sharply challenged the cable company's effort to buy Time Warner Cable — which it scrapped in April.
Last year he said that “everyone should be concerned” about the creation of a “dominant monopsony power,” and that federal regulators should take time to investigate it “very carefully.” Comcast fired back that Discovery had made “extortionate demands” in return for “Discovery's non-opposition to the Transaction.”
In February Zaslav said that he was “hopeful that Comcast will negotiate in good faith like all of our other distributors have over the last several years.”
But in May Zaslav told analysts not to worry. The dispute is “all behind us now” and “the goal now is to find a deal that makes sense for both of us.”
He picked up that theme this morning, calling Comcast “a dynamic and innovative company” that “has been a great partner of Discovery's for over two decades.”
Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit says the renewal “will enable our Xfinity TV customers to experience Discovery's content in more ways and on more platforms than ever before.”

This is not meant to be a supernatural feature list, but is based on the current Gnome development progress and the work outside of Gnome like openGL Foundation and Freedesktop. However what we describe here it might take longer or it might never happen.
We baptized the coming Gnome, GnomeX as we don't know the version, I guess it will be Gnome4 and will come after Gnome 3.6 or Gnome 3.8 followed by GTK4. Our GnomeX alpha manifesto has to be fully complied with the following goals.
For users GnomeX:
should be easily install-able and upgraded with silent updates
should ensuring the safety of user's data even if user lose his Gnome device/box by encryption and Cloud syncing.
should be available in a wide range of devices, all devices should communicate seamlessly with each other and offer a consistence experience.
should be personalized and extended in a user friendly way, keeping configurations online (ie Chrome) and keeping compatibility with different configurations on different boxes.
should be able to run applications that it might be 3 years old (backward compatibility).
should be able to communicate with different systems (iOS, Android, Windows)
should respect the regional preferences of the user, language, keyboard layouts etc
For developers GnomeX:
should be able to use the 100% of the hardware capabilities
should be supplied a stable API of top-level developing tools. Java, C# and Python should be dropped (in a long time run) for the sake of Vala, JavaScript and maybe Go (C is ofc here!)
should supply a set of standard libraries for Sound, Graphics, Plug and Play Devices (ie gamepads) etc
should supply a modern IDE for GTK+ Applications
should offer to developers a place (Application Market) to upload their work and get paid for it if they wish. Payment system should work similar to Humble Bundle or with a “Donation please” model
For manufacturers GnomeX:
should use only open source drivers that manufactures can modify and perfectly customize to their device specifications.
should run smoothly into a variety of devices with different screen resolutions, with different CPU/RAM resources, with different interface interaction means (mouses,touch screens, kinect etc) offering the same experience.
should only have one “face”. Building different Gnome-Shells for different devices would be wrong. GnomeX should only be modified with Themes & Plugins.
should be able to connect to non-open APIs out of box, like Netflix, Twitter, Yahoo, Windows Live etc (this applies for developers also).
While biggest problem in Linux is hardware drivers that is not the case in Tablets as the OEMs can build a device with fully Linux supported hardware.
According to the above manifesto we tried to decompose Gnome's 10 big goals for 2013/14.
10. Rolling releases / Silent Updates / Backward Compatibility
I placed this at number 10 not because I consider it the most insignificant goal of Gnome, but because I consider it as the most completed one. Porting applications in XDG Folders Specifications and into Gsettings alongside with Safe Updates seems to be almost close to target.
Also Extensions Auto Updates will solve the annoying problem of having broken extensions after updating your Gnome, but I am not sure what is going on with the themes.
9. Games / Commercial Software
While this isn't a direct Gnome goal, the success of every system comes always through its applications.
Let's be realistic. Serious Open Source gaming will never come, or more correctly will not come any time soon. So there isn't other solution than getting commercial games in Gnome. The beginning has been made by Valve's Steam and more recently with Unity engine. I just hope that commercial games won't force the open source to abandonment.
Other commercial software like Autodesk isn't a threat to Gnome's open source alternatives because this kind of programs cost thousands dollars and they are only for business use. Gimp will never be as good as Photoshop but you can still have your job done.
8. Cloud Accounts / Online services
Last year Cloud support has received huge development. There is already support in GOA (Gnome Online Accounts) for Google, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, Windows Live. Also Gnome 3.6 will get a skyDrive support. And there are more features in this area but we'll fully cover them in another post.
But there is always space for more. While you can use Dropbox or Ubuntu One to sync your data across devices what is missing is a way to sync your Gnome Preferences similar as Chrome/Chromium does.
This is a huge weakness of Gnome and I don't know if Gnome Team is working to that direction. But I am sure that they are aware of.
7. Gnome API for Developers
This is the biggest problem of Gnome since the very beginning. Do you want to develop an App for Gnome? You just don't know where to start from and what library to use.
Even if you choose the toolkit that you will use then you will fall on a poor documentation. And even if you manage to develop your application you might see that this library to get deprecated.
The last two years it clearly seems that Gnome Team works on it. Firstly by improving the Gnome Live and secondly by releasing a high level language. Vala might become the official Gnome Development Tool and also seems to getting a nice documentation.
6. Software Center
A modern software center with integrated software updates and software removal is on the way for Gnome and that will give another dynamic to the project.
Issue here is that it won't include a payment system for commercial software -a donate option might be available- but this is as good as bad. Promoting commercial software isn't the target of Gnome :)
5. Every detail matters
One of my favorite modules! It tries to solve every little annoying detail in Gnome. It's all about polish polish polish. Great project and with fast progress! Just check on it!
Also I will add here all these little things that they have to change in Gnome in order to be totally usable in touch devices.
4. 3d / openGL / Open Drivers
Whoever thinks that Closed Drivers can do the job is simply wrong. It is meaningless to analyze the cons of closed drivers (just watch Linus to get mad!). What is more meaningful is to watch the progress of openGL which still lacks in every aspect to Miscrosoft's Direct 3D.
The biggest goal here for Gnome is to get Open Source drivers with similar performance as closed. Well, It won't happen. nVidia and ATi won't release open any time soon.
However Intel with the new awesome Ivy Bridge chips is here! They can't compete nVidia but they are OK for everyday use (Browsing, HTML5 Games etc) and perfect for tablets.
3. Porting Gnome to Wayland
Wayland is the next generation display manager of Linux that will replace the 20 years old X Server. It promises slick graphics, fast interaction responses, better touch screen support, smooth scrolling and is pretty much the biggest thing that will happen in Linux Desktop world in the last decade.
GTK and Clutter are almost ready to run in Wayland but other toolkits like the one LibreOffice uses aren't and won't ever port in Wayland. For that reason Wayland and X Server will run at the same time (X Server will run on the top of the Wayland as plugin) keeping a backward compatibility.
2. Gnome OS
Gnome OS looks like NSA, Not Such Agency. Everyone talks about it, everyone denies it and everyone is trying to build it. Even the so -out of Gnome- Canonical thinks to release an unofficial Gnome spin with the upstream packages.
Gnome Foundation denies its existence but what that https://live.gnome.org/GnomeOS/ is? Gnome Team has already made plans for a Gnome Installer and while is too early to discuss it my best guess is that it isn't going to install Windows :)
Gnome OS is underway, sooner or later..
1. A picture is worth a thousand words
That is the obvious big goal of Gnome, get into tablets :)
This was a quick and dirty brainstorming. Can you propose more?
CHESTER, Texas–Residents in this sleepy east Texas community have taken it on themselves to stop the deadly Ebola virus from invading the city limits. Despite no one displaying any symptoms of illness, town leaders have forcibly quarantined all the librarians inside the Chester Public Library. Mayor Clay Henry said the move was made strictly as a precaution.
“When word got out that it was librarians who were spreading this Ebola, we decided to take action,” Henry explained, “It was either that or wait for the federal government. Do you think Barack Obama gives a rat's ass about Chester? I'll answer that for you; neither do we.”
Henry admitted that no one in the town of 1,200 has any medical training or reason to believe the librarians might be infected. He even confirmed that no one in Chester is really sure what the symptoms of Ebola might be, or how long the library workers should remain in quarantine.
“You'd have to go on the internet to look that up,” Henry said, “And the only internet in town is in the library.”
Henry said he met with the Chester city council just hours after news broke that a man in Dallas was diagnosed with Ebola. Shortly after the meeting, the police department locked the town's three library staff members inside the Chester Public library, where they've remained ever since.
“We heard the fella in Dallas was a librarian, and the first thought is, ‘we've got three of them right here in Chester',” Henry recalled, “So you have to do what it takes to keep your family safe by nipping this thing in the bud.”
“The only good thing is the librarians they's showing on the news is all been blacks,” Henry added, “Well they ain't no black folks in Chester. We're a good, decent town. The way I see it, we've got half the battle already won.”
By Malaysia Sun
George W. Bush and several other members of his administration have been found guilty of war crimes by the Kuala Lumpur Foundation to Criminalise War.
In a unanimous vote on Saturday the symbolic Malaysian war crimes tribunal, part of an initiative by former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad, found the former US President guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Seven of his former political associates, including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, were also found guilty of war crimes and torture.
Press TV has reported the court heard evidence from former detainees in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay of torture methods used by US soldiers in prisons run by the American forces.
One former inmate described how he had been subjected to electric shocks, beatings and sexual abuse over a number of months.
A high ranking former UN official, former UN Assistant Secretary General, Denis Halliday, who also attended the trial, later told Press TV that the UN had been too weak during the Bush administration to enforce the Geneva Conventions.
He said: “The UN is a weak body, corrupted by member states, who use the Security Council for their own interests. They don't respect the charter. They don't respect the international law. They don't respect the Geneva Conventions…A redundant, possibly a dangerous, and certainly corrupted organization.”
Following the hearing, former Malaysian premier Mahatir said of Bush and others: “These are basically murderers and they kill on large scale.”
It was the second so-called war crimes tribunal in Malaysia.
The token court was first held in November 2011 during which Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair were found guilty of committing “crimes against peace” during the Iraq war.
From Malaysia Sun:
Conservative pundit Tomi Lahren speaking with Chelsea Handler at Politicon.
Twenty-four-year-old conservative pundit Tomi Lahren railed against the expansion of the “entitlement state” this weekend in an onstage debate with Chelsea Handler at the third-annual Politicon conference in Pasadena, California.
Lahren, an Obamacare critic, who has suggested health insurance is a privilege not a right, admitted to Handler that she benefits from a key feature of Obamacare — the ability for young people to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26.
“Luckily, I am 24, so I am still on my parents' plan,” Lahren told Handler in a TMZ video of the event. “Now for me, if that were taken away from me, I'm okay, I don't need it. If it is to the betterment of a free-market system and health care is going to be better for it, I'm okay with that.”
Lahren, insisted that she was not critical of all of Obamacare — just the parts she doesn't really use — like the expansion of Medicaid. “If you can get your health care free and you can be subsidized, why would you work? There are other entitlements that help them there as well. That is the problem to me with the overgrown entitlement state.”
Lahren, of course, was recently fired from Glenn Beck's the Blaze for admitting she's pro-choice and has settled a wrongful-termination suit with the company. But last night, she stuck firmly to President Trump's side of the Republican party line. She attacked the media, blamed the Republican congressional leadership for failing to repeal and replace, and defended what Handler called President Trump's “lies,” as forgivable “exaggerations.”
Did Tomi Lahren just apply for a job in the Trump White House?
Four journalists found on the Turkish border with Syria after being kidnapped last June by al-Qaeda-linked group.
Four French journalists kidnapped in Syria last June by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group have been found by Turkish soldiers on the border with Syria.
Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Didier Francois were found on Saturday in Sanliurfa province with their hands and eyes bound.
An unknown group brought the journalists to the border last night, the Turkish news agency Dogan said.
They had been captured in two separate incidents in June last year while covering the conflict in Syria.
Footage of the journalists broadcast on Turkish television showed them looking unkempt, with beards and long hair, but they appeared to be in good health.
“I'm very happy to be free,” said 53-year-old Francois. “We thank the Turkish authorities because they really helped us. And it's very nice to see the sky, to be able to walk and to be able to speak freely.”
The Turkish soldiers initially took them for smugglers but took them to a police station in the small town of Akcakle near the border when they realised they were speaking French.
About 30 foreign journalists covering the Syrian civil war have been seized since the conflict began in March 2011, and many are still missing.
Reacting to the developments, the French presidential office released a statement saying that Francois Hollande “has learned with great relief this morning the release of the four French journalists who were held hostage in Syria since June 2013”.
“Edouard Elias , Didier Francois, Nicolas Henin and Pierre Torres are in good health, despite the extremely harsh conditions of their captivity. They will arrive in France in the next hours,” the statement read.
It said Hollande remained concerned about the fate of two other French nationals still held in the Sahel.
“He reaffirms his support to their families and reiterates his determination and the relentless mobilisation of the state for their release,” the statement added.

Black Voters Favor Hillary Clinton Over Bernie Sanders, Early Voting Shows
RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:
The crowd at many Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders rallies have been notably distinct. Clinton events often have large numbers of African-Americans. Sanders' do not. The Vermont senator has been struggling to expand his base of support to include people of color. And to talk more about this, we're joined now by Jamal Simmons. He's a political analyst who advised the Democratic National Committee during President Obama's first campaign. And we reached him in Detroit, Mich., which by the way is one of the states voting today. Good morning.
JAMAL SIMMONS: Good morning, Renee.
MONTAGNE: What is Hillary Clinton doing that Bernie Sanders is not when it comes to the African-American vote?
SIMMONS: Well, first of all, Hillary Clinton has a long history with her husband in working in African-American communities, so people know her. Secondly, African-American women are the number one voting block really in the country. They outperformed everyone else in 2012. And she's got a card to play with African-American women about being the first woman president. So I think you're seeing that hold some sway. Here in Detroit, where I am from and where the campaign is going to have a primary today, I was at a Hillary Clinton rally last night. I saw this diversity of crowd. Bernie Sanders is in places like Kalamazoo, Mich., Ann Arbor, where he's talking to students. And he's doing a great job of getting young people out. And younger African-Americans are interested in him. So the question is, what he's getting at young people support, will he get those young people to actually show up at the polls is the real question for his campaign.
MONTAGNE: Now, Bernie Sanders would argue - and some of these younger people understand that or back that - that he has fought his whole life for criminal justice and economic equality to issues very important to African-American voters. But let's listen to something Sanders said at this weekend's debate with Hillary Clinton when asked about racial blind spots in American society.
(SOUNDBITE OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE)
BERNIE SANDERS: When you're white you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto. You don't know what it's like to be poor. You don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or when you get dragged out of a car.
MONTAGNE: Now, there's been a lot of blowbacks about that remark. Why?
SIMMONS: Well, first of all, there are poor whites, so some whites do know what it's like to be poor. And not all African-Americans are poor and not all African-Americans live in ghettos. In fact, not even the majority of African-Americans live in ghettos. The majority of African-Americans, they live in the rural South or they live in American suburbs. And you could be middle-class, so you could be -not everyone lives in a ghetto. And you could still be harassed. So it sort of - it showed a little bit of a - not a deafness but a uncomfortableness with African-Americans and the issues they face when it comes from - it just wasn't handled really very well.
MONTAGNE: Is that a bit generational? That is to say Bernie Sanders' generation?
SIMMONS: I think it is generational. He also - I mean, perhaps this is what it was like in Brooklyn in the 1960s and 70s and when he was on campuses and doing work. And maybe, you know, living in Vermont, there aren't that many African-Americans there. But younger African-Americans, though, I don't think it matters as much because what they like is his focus on the economic issues. There's a great deal of concern among younger African-Americans around criminal justice issues, which they see the 1994 crime bill that President Clinton passed as a real issue for that. The question, though, is, can he get those younger African-Americans to turn out? Older African-Americans remember the fact that Bill Clinton hit the lowest African-American unemployment rate, I think in 40 years the lowest African-American poverty rate in our lifetime to that point. And so all of that was undone sort of during the Bush years and Bush recession. But before that, African-Americans had done pretty well under the Clintons. And I think Hillary Clinton is getting rewarded for that.
MONTAGNE: Well, just - we only just have a few seconds here. But the former president of the NAACP, Ben Jealous, recently endorsed Bernie Sanders, comparing him to Martin Luther King. What about that?
SIMMONS: (Laughter) You know, Ben Jealous is an enthusiastic supporter - he's an enthusiastic supporter of Bernie Sanders. And so he gets to say all sorts of things like that. And I think there are a lot of younger African-Americans who really do agree with him. This campaign will have - we'll see what it does in terms of turnouts. Again, middle-aged African-Americans are the most likely ones to show up. And so far they have been siding with Hillary.
MONTAGNE: All right. Well, thank you very much.
SIMMONS: Thank you. It's fun to be here.
MONTAGNE: Jamal Simmons is a Democratic strategist with the Washington consulting firm The Raven Group.

It might be one of the most cliched sayings in politics, but Jim Webb would be exactly right in stating that he didn't leave the Democratic Party — the Democratic Party left him.
On Tuesday, the former Virginia senator announced his withdrawal from his party's primary due to its abandonment of “millions of dedicated, hard-working Americans.” He further said, “I fully accept that my views on many issues are not compatible with the power structure and the nominating base of the Democratic Party.” (RELATED: Webb Withdraws: ‘If We Ran An Independent Race … I Think We Could Beat Both Of Them')
The Republican National Committee agreed with Webb's sentiment and issued a press release saying his departure was a sign that Democrats were moving towards the far-left fringe. (RELATED: RNC: Webb Dropping Out Is Proof Democrats Have ‘Moved Away From The American People')
Webb's alienation from the Democratic mainstream should be expected when the liberals in charge have, in fact, abandoned the archetypal common man. Democrats once lionized the figures of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson as champions of the little guy in American politics. Now both men are banished from Democratic events because they're too politically incorrect. (RELATED: The Guy Who Founded America Is No Longer Welcome At Democratic Dinner Tables)
The Democrats' resolute commitment to social liberalism and identity politics has turned away the old Blue Dog Democrat faction that Webb embodies. They were center-left when it came to economics, but oftetimes conservative when it came to social issues. But as Webb found out this election cycle, the modern party has zero tolerance for dissent on social matters. (RELATED: There's No Place For The Common Man In The New Democratic Party)
A new poll even shows that the party is the most liberal it's been in 15 years of surveying. (RELATED: Democrats More Liberal Than At Any Point In Last 15 Years, Surveys Show)
That's why this Reagan Democrat's stances on these issues listed below made him the unacceptable black sheep within a conformist herd.
Gun rights
During last week's debate, Webb was presented with his A- rating from the NRA like it was an endorsement from Hamas. He defended his record and stated unequivocally that Americans have the right to defend themselves and their families. He earned no applause for this deviation from liberal orthodoxy. (RELATED: Webb Takes A Dig At Hillary's Bodyguards, Says Americans Need Guns)
Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, had the highlight of her night when she chastised [crscore]Bernard Sanders[/crscore] for not being sufficiently in favor of gun control. Clinton got a lot of applause when she demanded immediate action to reduce gun ownership. Shortly after the debate, the Democrat front-runner said she was open to the idea of gun confiscation, an idea that's gaining steam within the American left. (RELATED: Hillary Reveals How She Wants To Confiscate Your Guns)
Even Sanders is having to backtrack his prior dissenting views on guns and is joining the call for “gun safety” measures. Democrats overwhelmingly support stricter gun laws by 77 percent and left-wing outlets are insistent that the federal government needs to do something right now to end gun violence.
There's a reason Webb wasn't applauded for defending the right to bear arms.
Affirmative action
Another one of Webb's tough questions he received during the debate was his prior statement claiming affirmative action was racist against whites. He clarified that he supported affirmative action for African-Americans — the people the initiative was designed for — and was opposed to other groups receiving it.
The former senator was also the lone candidate to say all lives matter during the debate, racking up another affront to left-wing identity politics. (RELATED: Webb The Only Democrat To Say All Lives Matter At Debate)
Webb said in his departure speech that the corrupted form of affirmative action is a result of the Democrats exploiting “interest group politics” and that the present system hurts “poor blacks and poor whites.”
As previously mentioned, the DNC is fully committed to identity-based grievance politics where every interest group tries to prove how America somehow victimized it. Clearly, Webb is not on board with that agenda.
Immigration
Webb is not quite an immigration hawk, but he was one of the few Democrats to vote against the 2007 amnesty legislation. He also believed in securing the border first, then addressing reform.
No Democratic senator voted against the 2013 version and the party appears to be fully in favor of giving citizenship to illegal immigrants without securing the border.
While Webb may be more willing to accommodate the party on this issue, his past transgression was likely going to be another headache for him. Sanders also voted against the 2007 amnesty and, even though he voted for the 2013 version, he's still getting criticized on that opposition.
Confederate flag
While the left went into frenzy over the thought of anyone owning a Confederate flag this summer, the Scots-Irish politician said the flag was a symbol that was hijacked by racists and it was primarily intended to honor the fallen soldiers of the losing side. That moderate remark caught almighty hell in the media, and Webb backtracked it slightly a few weeks later.
Meanwhile, the rest of the Democratic field declared war on the flag and essentially wanted it erased from existence. The Confederate flag is the historic symbol the left hates the most above all other icons and even a mild defense of it is not tolerated, especially in the party for liberals. (RELATED: Hillary Clinton Wants Businesses To Stop Selling Confederate Flags)
However, these rather conservative views don't exactly make Webb a perfect match for the GOP. His foreign policy leans towards non-interventionism and he was equally critical of Bush's Iraq war and Obama's Libyan excursion.
That outlook, along with his support of abortion, probably puts him outside the mainstream of the GOP as well. But, as shown with the insurgent candidacies of unorthodox Republicans like Ron Paul and Donald Trump, there's far more room for dissent within the Republican Party than there is in the Democratic Party.
The question remains: Will the man without a party join the only one that might offer him a welcoming hand?

Precision farming has been hailed as the future of agriculture, sustainability, and the food industry. That's why a company called FarmBot is working to bring precision agriculture technology to environmentally conscious individuals for the first time. The company's first product — the FarmBot Genesis — is a do-it-yourself precision farming solution, that (theoretically) anyone can figure out. The system is already up to its ninth iteration, and the open source robot improves in each version thanks to input from the FarmBot community.
Agriculture is an expensive and wildly wasteful industry. The precision farming movement may not solve every problem the industry faces, but it does have a lot of potential to improve sustainability and efficiency. Before FarmBot, precision agriculture equipment was only available in the form of massive heavy machinery. Precision farming tractors used to cost more than $1 million each when FarmBot creator Rory Aronson first had the idea for his solution in 2011.
The FarmBot robot kit ships with an Arduino Mega 2560, Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, disassembled hardware packages and access to the open-source software community. FarmBot Genesis runs on custom built tracks and supporting infrastructure, all of which you need to assemble yourself. The online FarmBot community makes it easy to find step-by-step instructions for every single assembly process. There are even forums to troubleshoot installing a FarmBot in your own backyard. The robot relies on a software platform that users access through FarmBot's web app, all of which looks a whole lot like Farmville, the infamous mobile game.
The physical FarmBot system is aligned with the crops you plot out in your virtual version on the web app. That's how Farmbot can reliably dispense water, fertilizer, and other resources to keep plants healthy and thriving. Since it doesn't require any delicate sensor technology, FarmBot is a cheaper solution than the industrial precision farming equipment on the market. And with its universal tool mount, you can adapt FarmBot to do pretty much any garden task you desire.
FarmBot is “coming soon” to Kickstarter, so you'll be able to order and assemble your own farming robot in the near future. Some DIY knowledge is definitely required to put FarmBot to work, though. At the very least, you'll need an Ikea-level ability to follow assembly instructions. According to the website, FarmBot Genesis was “designed to be a flexible FarmBot foundation for experimentation, prototyping, and hacking”. If any of those three things scare you, FarmBot may be an intimidating endeavor. But if you know your way around open source software and Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms, a FarmBot in your backyard could change the future of farming.

Next weekend is a really exciting one, I'm off to Norway for the Trondheim Regional with squad mates Oli Pocknell and Ben Lee, which should be an utterly awesome time. It's my first regional of the season and is in a country I've never visited before. International X-Wing is so good, if you've not tried it I highly recommend it. With the UK Open selling out in a night (rumours of more tickets abound) then check out the pages for Poland, Germany and Italy (plus a couple of others still to be announced) 2018 could be the year to give international pew pew a go.
I have two lists auditioning for the flight to Norway and two tournaments this weekend, which is convenient.
First up “That's Nuts” (97)
Boba Fett Fenn Rau Harpoon Missiles Proton Torpedoes Veteran Instincts Push the Limit Dengar Concord Dawn Protector Bomblet Generator Autothrusters Glitterstim Andrasta Ion Cannon Engine Upgrade
I think this is the weaker of the two lists auditioning but it is so much fun to fly and totally suits how I play the game. It's a guarantee that Saturdays event at Ibuywargames is going to be a test of it. Some of the best pilots in the South East of the UK are going to be there, the field is so strong we dubbed it the “Woking Masters”. Twenty Three players, 4 rounds of Swiss and a top four cuts.
I've played a couple of games in practice with this list with mixed results. It is a really unforgiving list. If my opponent makes a mistake it goes very wrong for them very quickly, if I make a mistake the same happens to me. And a room full of people not known for making mistakes playing X-Wing is a daunting prospect.
My four games (spoiler alert – I didn't make the cut or win) were a mix bag and I finished rather confused but those dice things. These two ships can absolutely batter things in the right circumstances, the trick is engineering those right circumstances.
In game one the obvious threat of their damage output caused Luke Berry of the Womprats to make a wrong turn with Fenn Rau, leaving him relatively unprotected against the opening salvo of munitions from my ships. Fenn did his best to dodge but even the hero of the Concord Dawn can't handle suffering two crits and a hit. After that the Mandalorians went into mop up duty. The fragile nature of the firespray came to the fore though as Luke was able to get Boba down to one hull before his last ship went boom.
Next up Calum Brown, who would go on to win the whole thing, with Miranda, Lowhhrick and a bargain basement hawk with the Crow title and a TLT. I made one mistake in the game, chosing a primary attack on Miranda over an ion cannon attack. Had I Ioned Miranda would have been stuffed the following turn, rather than able to drop a bomblet and zoom off. The opening exchange went badly, the green dice decided to punish me for the rest of the game as Boba dropped and despite his best efforts Fenn can't handle two TLTs.
At 1-1 I moved on to play Sim Singh, our games are always monumental. The opening engagement went to plan, Quickdraw Exploded, Fenn took a pasting but survived one more turn. Then Sim flew Vessery off the table, and the X-7 did it's a stupid thing of making defenders unkillable, as a PS 1 defender on 2 hulls took down Boba on 8 hulls. Negating 3 hits every turn without fail… I just couldn't get that 4 dice hit on him to make his dice go away. At the end of the game Sim was kissing his X-7 and I… I wasn't angry with Boba… I was just disappointed.
Last game and playing for pride. Zombie Squadrons Tim Farmer with double IGs. Tim and I have played many times, the games are always close but he has a tendency to edge them. IGs are such strong ships, they take so much killing and toward the end of the game Tim was very much in the driving seat, but Boba had other ideas. The IG was running it's luck a bit chasing the firespray around, taking bomblet after bomblet without suffering any damage. Then he rolled the hot dice I needed and shield, crit Harpoon, damage game on. Boba swung in for a range one attack, perfect dice for me. With an evaded token the IG had the chance to tank it with equally perfect dice. Perfect dice didn't happen and that bomblet won me the game.
Finishing 2-2 and coming 11th out of the 23 there was a good result considering the field but I can't help feeling disappointed by my mistakes that led to losses, or the fact that the list, whilst being great fun, does have huge vulnerabilities. The lack of consistency did get to me a bit by the end of the day, but Sunday at Warboar gives the other list an opportunity to strut its stuff.
My list for day two is LowRey. It's the list I took to GvC and did pretty well with, and which I think is more consistent than Boba Fenn. It lacks the threat and mobility, but it better defensively and the damage it does, whilst being less intimidating, is more reliable.
LowRey MK III (100)
Rey Lowhhrick Expertise Selflessness Kanan Jarrus C3PO Finn Jan Ors Millennium Falcon (HotR) Hull Upgrade Smuggling Compartment Counter Measures Scavenger Crane
Another strong field and a crowd of almost 30 players descended on Warboar for a Sunday spent playing with toy spaceships.
5 Rounds to play, after 3 rounds I was 3-0 up, and looking at the top four pairing options thinking “please not Calum again”… it was Calum again. Calum running his list of Miranda, HWK and Lowhhrick that had been so frustrating on Saturday for Boba Fenn. He won (again), but it was great to get a direct comparison. LowRey did better, where the Mandalorians were unable to get through the huge amount of damage mitigation Calum's list has the Rebels were more successful, dropping his Wookie and with a final throw of dying dice killing Miranda as well.
My final game was against Ben Lee was one to learn from. By the narrowest of margins I dropped Rey onto a rock in the opening engagement and the die was cast. Ben's Palp aces dished out a bucket load of punishment and as so often happens: when you make a stupid mistake, the dice punish you for it too. Rey couldn't dodge anything coming in despite countermeasures, a rock, Finn and having all incoming fire being in arc. A turn later she was finished and there's no way the wookie was going to do anything.
I finished 10th, which considering my cataclysmic mistake in the final game was a result I'll happily take.
Two hours drive home, a stop for the biggest kebab I have ever seen and some time to reflect on a great weekend with some great people for company. Which list gets to go overseas?
3-2 for the day, 5-4 for the weekend. Nine games played and a decision to make. Painful only from an emotional point of view…
LOWREY WILL RETURN!
If you're looking for local tournaments then head over to the 186th Tournament Calendar and see what's around.
On the morning of Dec.1, Demari DeReu drove to Columbia Falls High School in Montana and parked her blue-green Honda Accord in the lot, just as she does every morning. The 16-year-old honor roll student, class treasurer and varsity cheerleader walked in to school, forgetting entirely about the unloaded hunting rifle locked in the trunk of her car.
Later that day, there was an announcement telling students contraband sniffing dogs were scouting the parking lot, sparking her memory. She immediately told administrators that she'd forgotten to remove her scoped hunting rifle from the trunk following a Thanksgiving family hunting excursion.
She was suspended from school for violating federal and state gun laws.
On Monday, the school board will convene for a hearing to decide the fate and academic future of the high school junior, who recently was voted most dedicated cheerleader by her teammates and coach.
DeReu's supporters say her future success may be harmed irrevocably because of one mistake and a school board's lack of common sense, and they have been sending e-mails en masse and campaigning to garner support from around the region, and across the country.
But the school district superintendent, Mike Nicosia, says the entire issue has been blown out of proportion and that the school board members will be fair and wouldn't ruin the future of the bright honors student. He blamed outside influences for turning the whole thing into a circus.
The drama continues.
On Friday morning DeReu and her newly retained attorney are scheduled to hold a news conference outside the family's home.
When reached by phone, Scott DeReu, her father, described his daughter as an avid deer and elk hunter.
"She got a couple of deer," he said. "Never an elk...they're tough to find."
He declined to talk specifically about his daughter's issue.
And her supporters vow to descend Monday upon the school district building to protest during the school board hearing.
DeReu's high school has a zero tolerance policy about guns on campus — in a accordance with both state and federal law — and could lose funding under the terms of the federal Gun Free School Act if the law is not enforced.
State criminal law also prevents weapons from being brought into schools and provides for leniency on a case-by-case basis; DeReu did not bring the gun into school, but it was in the school parking lot, which falls under the purviews of the federal law.
Violators of the federal law face no less than a year expulsion — but the law provides some wiggle room, allowing school boards to show leniency on a case-by-case basis.
DeReu's future is in the hands of the school board, says Gary Marbut, president of Montana Shooting Sports Association, the state's largest gun advocacy group, responsible for getting dozens of gun-related laws passed in the state.
Marbut says he was contacted by DeReu's family following her suspension and has set them up with a lawyer to advocate on the student's behalf.
“They can expel her for a year or more. Her plan was to go to college next year,” he said, adding that DeReu wants to attend the University of Montana, Misoula, and become a respiratory therapist.
“But scholarship and some college applications require the applicant to explain all school suspensions. Can you imagine a gun-adverse application committee for girl expelled for a gun crime. It may be a deal killer for scholarships or maybe even for admission to college,” he said.
Nicosia, the school superintendent, told FoxNews.com he could not comment specifically on DeReu's situation, but he said board members generally are unlikely to dole out a severe, future-derailing punishment for a student in good standing who made a mistake.
A student in similar situation as DeReu would be unlikely to face lengthy expulsion and might not even be expelled at all, he said.
"I believe that if a student who comes to an expulsion hearing under that circumstances that presents itself, I don't believe the individual's future as far as college or making up work or progressing through their last year and half of high school would be any way jeopardized," he said.
The issue will go to the 8-member school board comprise of child-centered individuals who have dealt with this before and who will do the right thing, he said.
“They will put a punishment to fit the crime,” Nicosia said, and suggested that DeReu's future would not be jeopardized by the board's decision.
"We believe the right decision will be made."
Marbut is calling for no punishment at all. He wants the school to expunge the matter from DeReu's record, drop the matter entirely, apologize for its initial response and get her back in school immediately.
He cited an example of a similar case from last year when a boy was suspended and as a condition of his suspension wasn't allowed to make up any of the work he missed. This resulted in a plummet in the student's grade-point average.
“Suppose that takes her off the honor roll—how does that bode for her college education?” Marbut said. “We think the people of Montana should have no tolerance for school officials who have no common sense."
Nicosia said it was unfair that people outside the district, such as Marbut, had inserted themselves into the situation and painted the school district and its board with one sweeping negative brush.
"Sometimes you just have to trust reasonable people to make reasonable decisions, and I hope we haven't gone beyond that point in our country," he said.
It's that time of the season again, potential kits are being leaked online as Chelsea's disastrous season slowly comes to an end.
Following their exit from both the FA Cup and the Champions League, the Blues have all but nothing to play for, despite the small outside chance of a Europa League finish via a league position.
This is not the first time that potential kits have been leaked this season, earlier in the season, before the 2016-17 season had barely got under way, images of potential kits were being shared online.
This time, Voetbalshirtjes.com, are sharing images of what looks to be the front and back of the new home kit and also the front and back of the potential third kit for Antonio Conte's first season at Stamford Bridge.
There has been no official word on these kits as of yet, so take them with a pinch of salt, but what do you think of them?
Karl Rove knows the Democrats are in trouble. He even has the tattoos and body piercings to prove it.
During an appearance on Fox News on Thursday, Rove and host Greta Van Susteren addressed a video encouraging young people to enroll in Obamacare's health insurance marketplaces. The video, done by a President Obama impersonator, parodies Snoop Dogg's hit “Drop It Like It's Hot.”
“And if you need that new healthcare, sign up because it's hot,” the performer sings in the video.
An innocuous parody? Hardly.
Rove, the former right-hand man to a president who donned a flight suit and landed on an aircraft carrier before delivering a nationally televised speech, said he worries about “something that seems to aim at glorification of the commander-in-chief.”
“[The video] disturbingly gets too close to the line,” Rove said.
Van Susteren agreed and said the video is “sort of insulting to young people because it says get Obamacare because it's cool, not because substantively it is a good program for you, it's important for your health.”
But the effort is all moot anyway, as Rove went on to explain. Citing the Obamacare experience of his tatted-up touchstone, Rove contended that young people are poised to abandon Democrats.
“I have a young friend in Austin. She's 34 years old. I know her professionally,” Rove said. “She and her boyfriend had to go sign up under the Affordable Care Act for insurance. Her premiums went from just over $100 a month to nearly $400 a month. And her deductible went up 50 percent from $2,000 to $3,000. Now, she's got tattoos and some body piercings. You know, not exactly look like a normal Republican voter. My sense is she is not going to be particularly keen about voting Democrat this year (sic).”
To be fair, there is polling data that at least somewhat supports the point Rove was trying to make. A 2010 survey from Pew found that Democrats and liberals aged 18-29 are more likely to have tattoos than their conservative and Republican counterparts. Of course, Rove's professional friend doesn't fall in that age range and 34-year-olds generally aren't considered “young voters.”
As a fresh controversy arises in Delaware over whether parents should censor school reading lists, Dav Pilkey's Captain Underpants series tops the list of books which received the most complaints
As debate rages in Delaware over whether parents should be able to screen school reading lists for "obscene content", the latest list of the books most frequently challenged in US libraries shows it is not only classics that are being challenged.
Books from Fifty Shades of Grey to The Hunger Games have all drawn protests over the last year, with librarians reporting over 300 requests to remove books from shelves or exclude them from school curriculums.
According to local press, a board meeting in the Cape Henlopen school district in Delaware grew heated when two board members started speaking out against Aldous Huxley's dystopian classic, Brave New World, and calling for parents to be warned before children begin studying it. One father is reported to have told the meeting: "Parents might be able to file suit if they felt the school taught obscene content. Why would we teach kids what is negative in society? Let's teach them what is right, to become good citizens and improve the fabric of society."
With the board yet to make a decision, librarians and free speech organisations have lined up to support Brave New World. Deborah Caldwell Stone, deputy director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, argued that "schemes to label classic works of literature like Brave New World as 'explicit' or 'depressing' only serve to deny students the opportunity to explore the important and challenging ideas presented in these works", adding that "the irony, of course, is that students inevitably seek out and read the books adults ban or label as 'bad books'".
A letter from the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) to the Cape Henlopen school board, meanwhile, warns that "focusing on content that someone might consider inappropriate or objectionable inevitably takes material out of context and distorts the meaning of the book".
"If Brave New World receives a warning, what book will be next, and who will decide which books need warnings?" said NCAC executive director Joan Bertin. "Those who object to this book are entitled to their view, but they may not impose it on others, even to the extent of demanding that the school adopt warnings about content they find objectionable."
The challenges to Brave New World come as the American Library Association (ALA) releases its list of the 10 most frequently challenged books of 2013, after collecting reports on book challenges from librarians and teachers over the past year. A challenge, says the ALA, "is defined as a formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that a book or other material be restricted or removed because of its content or appropriateness".
Topping last year's list was Dav Pilkey's Captain Underpants series, about two schoolchildren who hypnotise their schoolteacher to turn him into a pants-wearing superhero. The bestselling books are, according to challenges, jam-packed with "offensive language [and] violence".
Second was Nobel laureate Toni Morrison's acclaimed The Bluest Eye, which according to one challenge has been demonstrated by "medical and social science" to be "harmful to minors" and is also criticised for the lack of "clear and unequivocal condemnation of the rape, incest, paedophilia, and other repulsive acts" described in the novel.
Sherman Alexie's award-winning young adult novel The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian – banned last week in Idaho schools – came in third, with EL James's erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, and Suzanne Collins's mega-bestselling dystopian young adult novel The Hunger Games in fourth and fifth places. James's book drew objections over its use of "nudity" and "offensive language", and for being "sexually explicit", while The Hunger Games was challenged for its "religious viewpoint" and for being unsuited to its age group.
The top 10 is rounded out by A Bad Boy Can Be Good for a Girl by Tanya Lee Stone, Looking for Alaska by John Green, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, Bless Me Ultima, by Rudolfo Anaya and the Bone comic book series by Jeff Smith.
While the ALA welcomed the fact that the number of reports on attempts to remove material from shelves and school curriculums fell in 2013, to 307 from 464 in 2012, its Office for Intellectual Freedom's executive director Barbara Jones warned against "read[ing] into the decrease in book challenges reported to the ALA, as the removal of just one book from a library prevents hundreds from having free access to information".

The mooted savings levy in Cyprus is a form of wealth confiscation on behalf of the EU which is making depositors throughout the Union nervous. There has been no dramatic increase in the demand for gold in recent days. However, this could be a ‘tipping point' moment when savers realise that they are unsecured creditors of banks and their savings are not sacrosanct.
Dr. Ron Paul was interviewed by Fox after the U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed it will continue its QE program highlights the importance of gold as money.
On July 13, 2011, when Dr. Paul was a U.S. Congressman he asked U.S. Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, "Do you think gold is money?" and Bernanke replied, "No, it's a precious metal."
Dr. Paul countered, “Even though it's been used for 6,000 years?” But Bernanke denied gold was money and said, “No, it's an asset. Just like T-Bill's are not money.”
The Fox News interviewer then commented, “Cyprus has taught us that governments can confiscate money that you've earned or even paid taxes on. Rampant quantitative easing and price fixing by governments may prop up the stock markets but it doesn't keep unemployment down. The U.S. Fed is going to continue its QE program which is good for gold.”

If you think about refugees fleeing their country for safety do you think they use a government's paper currency to help get them out? No it is money like gold that is used to help buy their freedom.
Dr. Ron Paul continues to believe that once the government destroys its currency it has to turn back to something it believes in like gold.

Therefore, Dr. Ron Paul feels a gold backed currency will be used in our economy again.
My secret Santa was very good! I guess I didn't give enough information initially but sent them a biography of the things I like and what I'm into. From this, I got two very awesome books!!
When I got home from our local Christmas parade, I found the Amazon package sitting in front of the door. I was very excited. I may not be getting much for Christmas this year due to finances so just being to open a Christmas present was awesome.
I quickly brought it inside and opened it up and inside were 2 books. "Franny and Zooey" by JD Salinger (one of my favorite authors) which was perfect because I do not have it in my collection. I'm looking forward to the reread. Also, I received "Florence Nightingale to her Nurses" by Florence Nightingale. I'm finishing up my first semester of RN school and Nightingale is the mother of modern nursing so it's a perfect fit. I'm glad I'll have time over the Winter break to read these books. My secret Santa hit the nail on the head!!
Thank you, Secret Santa. You've made my day!!

Donald Trump has gotten a lot of attention over the past 12 hours for referring to the Sept. 11 terror attacks as "7/11" during a speech in Buffalo. It's an awkward, amusing slip-up -- but it's just a slip-up.
More interesting, perhaps, is something he said shortly afterward.
Trump was talking about "New York values" -- a means of dismissing Ted Cruz in Trump's home state. As he did during the debate where Cruz first made the point, Trump was using the attacks as a way of espousing what it is that New Yorkers stand for. Unusually for him, he was reading from a sheet of paper.
Then he offered this aside.
During a rally in Buffalo on Monday, Donald Trump said he helped clean up rubble at Ground Zero on 9/11. (Reuters)
"Everyone who helped clear the rubble -- and I was there, and I watched, and I helped a little bit -- but I want to tell you: Those people were amazing," Trump said. "Clearing the rubble. Trying to find additional lives. You didn't know what was going to come down on all of us -- and they handled it."
That modifier "a little bit" does a lot of work: Did he mean he picked up a few chunks of concrete? Sent staff to assist? It's not clear.
Particularly coming in the middle of an exposition of the courage of first responders, Trump's statement that he "helped a little bit" is an interesting one. The implication is clear: Trump was helping to clear the rubble, worried that damaged buildings surrounding the site were going to topple over "on all of us." In a normal context, Trump would seem to be asking the listener to offer him some of the credit he's giving to those that were on the scene. In the context of a presidential campaign? That becomes more fraught.
Donald Trump unquestionably went to Ground Zero after the attacks. New York Newsday reported on an appearance the previous day in its Sept. 14 paper.
The workers are so worn out that they barely glance at the sight of Donald Trump, every hair in place and impeccably dressed in a black suit, pressed white shirt and red tie, walking into the plaza with his cellular phone to his ear. "No, no. The building's gone," he says into the phone.
A blogger spotted him the same day on West Street, which runs along the western edge of the site. That appears to be where Trump conducted an interview with German news media that day.
The reporter at one point asks, "Will you be involved, will you take any efforts, any steps to reconstruct the area?"
"Well, I have a lot of men down here right now," Trump replies, apparently misunderstanding the reporter's question. "We have over 100 and we have about 125 coming. So we'll have a couple of hundred people down here."
Trump also says that he "just went to what they call 'Ground Zero'" as the interview begins. His hair is a bit more unkempt than is the norm, but his suit doesn't appear too mussed.
Beyond that, most of the contemporaneous news reports about Trump and Ground Zero are reports about Trump's vision for the site once rebuilt. A week after the attacks, Trump led the New York Post's Page Six gossip column.
"At first, Donald Trump didn't want to talk about the terrible events that have changed our city's skyline more than anything the mega-developer has ever erected," it begins. "But yesterday, we did talk on the phone about what should happen at the site of the World Trade Center." Trump's vision is that "what goes up there should be a form of memorial to the dead." There's no mention of his assisting at the site.
Trump has mentioned the attacks in other contexts on the campaign trail. The Daily Beast looked at his claims that he'd lost "hundreds of friends" in the attacks, which seems fairly obviously hyperbolic. And, of course, there was his infamous assertion that he watched Muslims in New Jersey celebrating as the buildings fell. That claim has been repeatedly debunked.
We reached out to the Trump campaign for an explanation of what Trump was referring to when he said he "helped." If we receive a response, we'll add it.
One month after Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz's death, the mystery around who killed the Fox Lake officer appears to be no clearer than in the days following his shooting.
Investigators shared new information at a press conference outside the Fox Lake police station Thursday, including revealing for the first time that Gliniewicz was shot twice with his own weapon. But Lake County sheriff's office Detective Christopher Covelli also said that despite diligent work, all theories remain on the table in the "extraordinarily complex" investigation.
Gliniewicz was shot once in the right-side front of his protective vest and once in the upper-left chest area, said George Filenko, commander of the Lake County Major Crime Task Force.
There were indications at the crime scene that a struggle occurred, but test results were inconclusive in determining whether Gliniewicz fired his service weapon, Filenko said.
"In layman's terms, the weapon could have been fired by Lt. Gliniewicz, or he could have been in close proximity to the weapon being fired," Filenko said.
Gliniewicz, 52, was found dead near U.S. Highway 12 in Fox Lake on Sept. 1, shortly after he radioed that he had spotted suspicious activity and was pursuing three people on foot.
Filenko described the shot to the lieutenant's right side as "similar to that of a sledgehammer" and severe enough to be incapacitating.
He said he could not comment on what at the scene suggested a struggle had taken place, or whether other shots had been fired. Authorities have previously said Gliniewicz's .40-caliber service weapon was found near his body and that multiple gunshots were fired at the scene.
Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, a 30-year veteran of the Fox Lake Police Department, conducted a "staged suicide" on Sept. 1, 2015, according to the Lake County Major Crime Task Force.
Covelli said that although authorities have not yet determined the manner of the officer's death, they are investigating the case as a homicide based on the evidence and facts available.
Coroner Thomas Rudd previously raised the possibility the second, fatal shot to Gliniewicz's chest was self-inflicted, saying he needed additional information from police before deciding on a matter of death, whether homicide, suicide, accidental or undetermined.
Melodie Gliniewicz, the officer's widow, said in an interview with Crime Watch Daily that talk of suicide was "disrespectful, hurtful, irresponsible" and didn't fit with her husband's focus on the future. He'd been applying for chief of police jobs, talking about retiring from Fox Lake and planning family vacations, she said.
"I wholeheartedly believe he was murdered," she said tearfully.
Investigators have recovered nine unidentified DNA samples from the crime scene, and further testing has determined that one of those belongs to a male, Filenko said. He said he couldn't say where the DNA was found at the scene and that it's not yet clear from how many different people those samples came. Authorities will continue collecting DNA samples Thursday and expect to submit between 30 to 40 new samples to the state crime lab by Friday for further testing, he said.
The funeral for Fox Lake police Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, 52, on Sept. 7, 2015, included an 18-mile procession through Antioch, his hometown, and Fox Lake, the community he served.
"DNA is always significant. Until we identify it, we can't eliminate any possibility," Filenko said.
Authorities also are awaiting results of additional ballistics testing, Filenko said.
As yet, investigators have identified no motive, he added.
Authorities also revealed additional information about Gliniewicz's activity the morning of the shooting. According to Filenko, GPS data showed he was in the area near the crime scene for about 20 minutes before radioing that he had seen suspicious activity. Filenko said Gliniewicz may have been patrolling the area on foot after village officials raised concerns about vandalism in the area.
Village officials held a staff meeting to discuss potential problems on the property, including spray-painted graffiti and kids breaking into a building, about a month before Gliniewicz's death, said village spokesman Dave Bayless.
Though Gliniewicz initially said he didn't need assistance from another officer after reporting the suspicious activity, when a dispatcher asked a second time, he said yes, Filenko said.
Previously, authorities said they believed the three people Gliniewicz described remained in the Fox Lake area after the shooting, but Filenko said Thursday it's possible they fled immediately. Investigators tested paths of escape from the crime scene and found that some led to major roadways within minutes, when the perimeter could have taken up to an hour to set up, he said.
Authorities have held back details about the officer's shooting death because they don't want to compromise a potential prosecution by providing information only the gunman or a witness would know, Filenko said.
Both he and Covelli said they decided to release some additional details partly in response to questions about the limited information released so far.
Filenko said they are trying to be transparent because "I've heard the word conspiracy quite often."
Covelli and Bayless said Gliniewicz was not involved in an internal investigation into the police department's handling of an altercation between an officer and a man who had been arrested in December 2014 — a probe that led to the officer and police Chief Michael Behan being placed on paid administrative leave. Bayless said Gliniewicz had been part of a police department review of procedures and equipment done as a "best practice" during the change in leadership after Behan's retirement. He left the department just days before Gliniewicz's death.
The review and the internal investigation are both still in progress, and Bayless said it wasn't clear when results would be available.
Covelli and Filenko stressed that the investigation into Gliniewicz's death remains very active as it enters a second month.
"There hasn't been any kind of slowdown here," Filenko said.

HOOVER, Ala. — Quarterback Nick Marshall's status within Auburn's football program remains undecided following his weekend citation for marijuana possession, Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said Monday.
"Nick made a mistake and he'll have to deal with the consequences," Malzahn said. "I'm not ready to say what those consequences are at this time, but he will deal with it."
SEC MEDIA DAYS: Mike Slive says SEC must pursue separation if NCAA autonomy isn't gained
Marshall, a rising senior and projected Heisman Trophy contender, was pulled over Friday in Reynolds, Ga., for a window tinting violation. After an odor of marijuana was detected, officers found drug residue inside Marshall's car amounting to less than an ounce – leading to a citation, not an arrest.
Late Sunday, Auburn announced that Marshall would not attend SEC Media Days as one of the Tigers' three player representatives. Instead, Auburn sent tight end C.J. Uzomah.

"It is a privilege and a reward to represent Auburn here at the SEC Media Days," Malzahn said. "Last Friday Nick lost that privilege.
"We have high expectations for our players, but specifically our quarterback, being the face of our program. Up until last Friday, Nick has been a model student, teammate, and citizen. I know he's regretful and he feels very bad about it."
While Marshall's status remains up in the air, another Auburn star might miss the entire coming season.
Malzahn confirmed defensive end Carl Lawson's springtime knee injury – suffered during the last week of drills – was an ACL tear, meaning the sophomore could not return until the latter stages of the regular season, if at all.
A five-star member of Malzahn's first recruiting class, Lawson contributed as a situational rusher as a rookie, finishing second on the team with four sacks. He was expected to assume a far larger role as a full-time starter in 2014, helping Auburn replace end Dee Ford, an All-SEC selection.
The surgery was successful, Malzahn said, adding that Lawson is "working extremely hard and he's determined to come back towards the end of this year."
ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM SEC MEDIA DAYS
Alcohol drinking and smoking are independent risk factors for upper digestive tract cancers. Furthermore, their combined use interacts in a multiplicative way on cancer risk. There is convincing evidence that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol and a constituent of tobacco smoke, is a local carcinogen in humans. Therefore, we examined the combined effect of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking on in vivo acetaldehyde concentration in saliva. Seven smokers and 6 nonsmokers participated in the study. First, to measure the effect of alcohol on salivary acetaldehyde, all volunteers ingested 0.8 g/kg body weight of ethanol and saliva samples were collected every 20 min for 160 min thereafter. After a 3-day washout period, smokers ingested again the same amount of ethanol and smoked one cigarette every 20 min and saliva samples were collected at 10 min intervals for 160 min. Acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations were analyzed by headspace gas chromatograph. Firstly, smokers without concomitant smoking during ethanol challenge had 2 times higher in vivo salivary acetaldehyde concentrations than nonsmokers after ethanol ingestion (AUC 114.8 +/- 11.5 vs. 54.2 +/- 8.7 microM x hr, respectively; p = 0.002). Secondly, smokers with active smoking during ethanol challenge had 7 times higher in vivo salivary acetaldehyde levels than nonsmokers (AUC 369.5 +/- 12.2 vs. 54.2 +/- 8.7 microM x hr, respectively; p < 0.001). We conclude that this markedly increased exposure of upper digestive tract mucosa to carcinogenic salivary acetaldehyde of smoking and drinking subjects may explain the synergistic and multiplicative risk effect of alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking on upper gastrointestinal tract carcinogenesis.

Cops: Babysitter, 22, Got All Stabby When Man Refused To Have Sex With Her Share
Tweet
Meet Shakieria Anquanette Shan Long.
The 22-year-old Florida woman stabbed a man in the neck earlier this month after he declined her requests to have sex, police allege.
Long, pictured at right, was “barbecuing and drinking” with friends at a Fort Pierce home on August 12 when trouble began, according to a witness cited in a police report.
The witness said that he was lounging on a couch when Long and the victim, Eugene Sylvester, entered the residence. “The suspect was screaming that she wanted the victim to have sex with her,” cops reported. But Sylvester, 32, declined Long's advances, telling her to “go back where she had been all day and have sex.”
Sylvester told cops that Long was his children's babysitter.
Long, who is known as “Sha Sha,” subsequently followed Sylvester to his room, where she allegedly “grabbed a knife and started jabbing” at him with the weapon. She then beckoned the witness, telling him that she had stabbed Sylvester (and that he was “leaking”).
The witness told investigators that he pressed a towel to Sylvester's neck and began walking him home. But Long ran after them and “started punching the victim in his face,” as first reported by TCPalm.
During police questioning, Sylvester--whose wound needed a few stitches--said he did not want to have sex with Long due to her heavy drinking. While confirming that Long stabbed him in the neck, Sylvester said that he did not want to press charges against her.
Collared for felony battery, Long was booked into the St. Lucie County jail, where she remains locked up. At the time of the stabbing, Long was free on $3750 bond in connection with a June 6 arrest for disorderly intoxication, resisting arrest, and battery on a law enforcement officer. That bond was cancelled following this month's bust.

JOHNATHAN Thurston says Cowboys stars will shun the Roosters' booze-ban stance as he declared attitude, not alcohol, will determine North Queensland's hopes of a maiden title.
Thurston and Cowboys coach Paul Green told The Courier-Mail they have no intention of emulating the Roosters by prohibiting alcohol consumption in the run to the finals.
Fellow title contenders the Roosters called last drinks week, reprising the booze-free policy that underpinned the Bondi club's surge to the premiership in 2013.
Sydney prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves has backed the club's stance, describing the booze ban as a “powerful thing” that is proven to have helped the Roosters to the holy grail.
But Thurston believes the notion of giving up the demon drink is less important than the mental lapses which he warned could see the Cowboys thrashed in the playoffs.

Asked if the Cowboys would follow the Roosters' lead by going on a booze ban, Thurston said: “No, we haven't brought any of that up at all.
“It's an exciting time of year so you have to enjoy it.
“We have a really tough run coming up with the Sharks, Souths and Melbourne (in the next month) and they are teams who won't let us come back and score points.
“The last two weeks have been terrible for us in terms of holding the ball. We need to be better with our completion rates other teams will be putting 50 on us.”
Green was an assistant coach to Trent Robinson when the Roosters adopted the zero-booze policy in their eventual charge to the 2013 premiership.
Now in his second season at the Cowboys, Green can see the merit in booze bans, but isn't convinced swapping lagers for lattes can guarantee title supremacy.
“Each group is different,” Green said.

“The thing with that (booze-ban concept) is that the players are giving something up for the good of the team, whatever that might be.
“For some guys, it might be giving up booze, for other guys it might be a particular food.
“The whole concept is about investing in the team and putting yourself out for your teammates.
“If everyone is on board with a booze ban, it can be a good thing ... the trouble is if you don't get everyone on board, it can also be a negative thing as well.
“A booze ban doesn't guarantee you anything but it's making sure your preparation is spot on.
“Our guys are good are very good in that regard, one thing we have said as a group is that we are committed to making sure we are prepared to train well.”
Cowboys co-captain Matt Scott challenged his troops to lift, rating Brisbane and the Roosters the premiership favourites.
“The Broncos and Roosters are the benchmark,” he said. “They are playing very dominant styles of footy, we have a long way to go to reach that level.
“But the guys are working hard and I'm sure we can get there.”
Armenians' PornHub visits from smartphones grew 65% in 2016
Visits by Armenian users to Pornhub from smartphones has increased 65% in 2016, the video sharing website revealed recently.
In the reporting period, traffic to the site from these types of devices increased from 53% up to 61%, stealing shares from desktop which dropped 8% from a year ago.
Two countries that have seen the highest increase in mobile traffic include Cuba and Turkey. Cuba seeing an increase of 310% – possibly because diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba were restored earlier in 2016, there might have been an ease in restrictions.
In third was Sudan, trailing far behind the top two countries with an increase of 87% in mobile traffic share.
Ukraine and Belarus experienced a 75% increase in mobile traffic and Armenia rounded out the top ten list with an increase of 65%.
A supporter throws a floral garland at AAP leader, Arvind Kejriwal upon his arrival for a four-day visit of Gujarat.
The possibility of a Narendra Modi versus Arvind Kejriwal fight in next month's national election looks stronger with the Aam Aadmi Party today saying their chief is waiting to see where the BJP's prime ministerial candidate will contest.Mr Kejriwal, 45, also did not rule it out as he responded to a question today on challenging Mr Modi with a non-committal, "Let us see."Shortly after the Election Commission announced polls from April 7 to May 12, AAP leader Yogendra Yadav said the party would focus on constituencies featuring the "big candidates" as it had only 30 days to campaign."In the case of Mr Kejriwal, he would be looking at where Mr Modi is contesting, in fact that's one of the things all of us are watching (sic)," AAP leader Yogendra Yadav told NDTV."We will see whether he wants to play it safe or contest outside Gujarat too."Mr Modi and his party have not yet disclosed where he will contest from, but there is speculation that he could pick two seats, one in Gujarat and another in Uttar Pradesh, India's most politically vital state.AAP leaders have dropped strong hints that Mr Kejriwal, who resigned as Delhi chief minister last month, may fight Mr Modi if he contests from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, or anywhere outside Gujarat. AAP leader Manish Sisodia said on Sunday, "Mr Kejriwal will ask Modi questions from Varanasi."Mr Kejriwal is currently in Mr Modi's turf Gujarat, where he will spend three days "assessing" the Chief Minister's development claims. Last night, on NDTV's Candidates 2014, the former taxman had said that he was "not sure" he would contest the polls.The one-year-old AAP will contest first national election since its dazzling debut in the December Delhi polls on the back of an unconventional campaign and a promise to root out corruption and VIP culture. Opinion polls predict that the BJP, led by Mr Modi, will emerge as the largest party but fall short of a majority in the general election that begins on April 7. Results will be declared on May 16.
Justin Trudeau fancies himself a pugilist, but even his supporters must be wondering whether the last few rounds in the political ring haven't left him a little punch drunk.
In case you missed it, Trudeau this week stuck to his…um…guns and refused to back Canada and its allies' military mission to combat ISIL. Once again, Trudeau declared that Canada should instead support a robust humanitarian intervention.
To which I say: Alan Henning.
Henning was a taxi driver from Manchester who was so moved by the plight of suffering Syrian children that he went to the region to drive aid convoys. He came back in a pine box after fellow Brit Mohammed Emwazi – a.k.a. Jihadi John – cleaved off his head in a snuff video. Given that others have also lost their heads for these same “sins”, I'll wager ISIL isn't interested in our charity.
I'll give Trudeau the benefit of the doubt; I don't even think he believes what he says about humanitarian aid being the only role for Canada. He knows that aid will only reach those in need once the people who are raping, enslaving and killing them are stopped. And stopping them involves guns and bombs. Trudeau's preference is simply for others to do that particular dirty work.
Stirring stuff, to be sure.
Trudeau's tack to peacenik is all about finessing the left-right divide to get elected. To do that, remember, he not only has to beat Harper, he also needs to beat Mulcair, which goes a long way to explaining his recent political choices.
For those of you keeping track, Trudeau has now declined to support a military mission that is endorsed by literally everyone (the Pope!) except ISIL and the NDP, while declining to vote against anti-terror legislation that is vehemently opposed by a laundry list of credible critics with genuine concerns.
But don't worry, Trudeau has threaded that needle too. Having signalled his opposition to Bill C-51, he then said he wouldn't actually, you know, like, vote against it or anything. He'll just punt the issue to the next Parliament, where he says he'll fix it after the fact. Arrogance, it turns out, is an inherited trait.
Of course, rope a dope can be a winning strategy for an opposition leader hoping the incumbent will tire himself out, but it also requires keeping your gloves up. Perhaps Trudeau thought he was invincible when the Tory attack ads failed to fell him, but the fallout from the first Iraq debate rattled his cage and he hasn't looked steady since.
The uniting thread appears to be Trudeau's unwillingness to engage in a fight with the government when he knows he's on the wrong side of public opinion. To wit, he stuck Marc Garneau and Joyce Murray out to defend the ISIL decisions and twisted himself into a pretzel to avoid debate on the second. But whom did he impress with that particular feat of engineering? The right now thinks he can't be counted on to get tough on terror, while the left is angry that he isn't standing up to be counted in the House of Commons. It's too clever by half.
In ducking a fight with Harper on C-51, Trudeau has also left his flank exposed to Thomas Mulcair. The NDP leader was in danger of being counted out but Trudeau has instead given him new life. And nothing pleases Conservative strategists more than the thought of a rejuvenated NDP siphoning votes away from the Liberals in Ontario.
Trudeau is caught in a trap of his own making. Being the party of the centre is a tricky business. To pull it off, Liberals used to campaign as socialists and govern as conservatives. Now that they're in opposition it seems the Liberals can't decide if they should hug the centre-right and count on people wanting a change, or tack left and present themselves as the only alternative to Stephen Harper.
There's still time for a course correction and absolutely no one is suggesting Trudeau throw in the towel. He has savvy coaches in his corner and the kid can throw a punch. Just ask Patrick Brazeau. Or his Senate caucus. Or, while we're at it, Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti.
That said, landing a few blows would be easier if Trudeau had some firmer ground on which to stand. Part of Trudeau's uneven performance is undoubtedly due his lack of policy to peddle.
Keeping the power dry and tap dancing until the election is a risky gambit for Trudeau; without substance, Canadians might end up pegging him as a Marxist, and not a centrist.
For as Groucho Marx famously said: “those are my principles, and if you don't like them…well, I have others.”

The deadlift is probably one of the most revered lifts in training. It's one of the top movements for maximal amount of weight moved, is a common staple exercise for bodybuilding, strongman competitors, Olympic athletes of any sport, and even useful in rehabilitating low back injuries. Because of the propensity for ego to exceed logic, especially in the weight room, you'll want to make sure you're using all possible benefits to your advantage while making sure you're safe, yet still throwing around more plates than a dishwasher at Dennys. Todays post will show some simple yet very effective things you can use in your workout to maximize the benefits for your pulls, without taking much time and energy at all. These are the low-hanging fruit that can reap big rewards. #1: Get the lats fired up BEFORE you pull Lat strength and activation is a major feature of a good deadlift. When I hit it right, I get more of a pump in my lats than from anywhere else. They connect the shoulder to the spine, and run from the T-10 vertebrae by the base of the shoulder blade right down to the sacrum, and interconnect with a lot of the fascial slings that help stabilize the low back, while also pulling the spine into extension to reduce the flexion moment of hoisting massive poundages from the floor. In leymans terms, they help hold the entire spine together during the deadlift and getting them involved in the party can make or break a good pull. For these reasons, as well as simply lats look hella cool when they're rocking a sick pump, getting them to kick up a notch before a set is a key feature to having a stronger pull. A simple way to do this is to use a band and go through a mimicked deadlift set where the resistance is pulling forward.
A key to this movement is to make sure the arms stay vertical throughout the entire movement, much like what you would see with an actual deadlift. This helps the lats stay on through the range of motion, which involves moving the shoulders through a small range of extension, helping them squeeze harder. Finishing the movement with a strong glute contraction and abdominal bracing helps to reinforce core and pelvic stability, which is stupidly important with this movement. Do 5 reps of this drill before a pull and see what happens. #2: Tires Touch the Road I used to work as a tire technician on big tractor trailers when I was in university, and one of the key things I always looked at was the wear pattern on the tires to see if the alignment was off, as well as the tread depth to see if the tires were worn out or not. Since the tires were the only part of the vehicle that touched the road, it was as important to make sure they were working properly as it was to look at the brakes. If your wheels locked up but the tread didn't create friction with the ground, you would just continue to slide around versus coming to a strong stop, or might not corner as well, a big problem if you're hauling a large load. Similarly, your feet are the only part of your body that's in contact with the floor during a deadlift, and all of the alignment of every joint above is dependent on how the foot is structured underneath. Standing with a flat foot to hit a heavy pull tends to result in the tibia and femur rotating internally, which stressed the hip, pulls it into an anterior pelvic tilt, and alters how well the low back can stabilize the movement. Conversely, a high arch pushes more weight to the outside of the foot, which can increase external rotation of the leg and result in a posterior tilt of the pelvis. Either position can be trained effectively, but sometimes a small change can make a big impact in how you approach the movement. For those with flat feet, thinking of actively contracting the arches of your feet can have a huge impact in creating some proactive and stabilizing tension through the lower leg, which makes your pull a lot more effective as it increases activity through the entire posterior chain. It also helps you form a more solid base, much like a linebacker in football taking a wider and lower stance versus standing upright with their feet together.
#3: Turn your Right Foot Out Before getting too deep into this one, let's discuss the pertinent anatomy a little more thoroughly to understand how and why this should be a consideration. There are four different types of pelvis when looking at the width, breadth and angulations of the sit bones (technically known as the ischial tuberosities). This is important because the wider and shorter the arches, the less likely they can sustain during crazy heavy loadings. The best hips for heavy vertical loading are narrow and deep. The Android and Anthropoid hip positions are the most favorable for pulling a sick deadlift off the floor, whereas the wider and shallower gynecoid and platypelloid hips would most likely result in an epic fail and probably injury. Additionally, the angle of the femoral neck which joins the shaft into the ball that forms the hip joint can be different. A “normal” angle is roughly 120-135 degrees, but you could also get angulation less than 120 and greater than 135. Each of these would provide different abilities. A more vertical femoral neck angle could help with loading, whereas a more horizontal angle could help with more mobility. The femoral neck could also be rotated forward or backward outside of a neutral position. Someone with a forward rotation could have a lot of easy pulls off the floor but struggle during lockout, whereas someone with a more posterior rotation could struggle to get the weight off the floor due to increased range of stretch on the glutes in this position, but could lock out like a boss once they have shortened the muscle up enough to produce more power. Interestingly, forensic scientists have the ability to tell what part of the world someone was from based solely on the shape and angulation of their bones. Many individuals who come from Scotland tend to have what is known as a Celtic or Dalmatian hip structure, with a much deeper hip socket and thicker ring of their acetabulum. This tends to help with vertical positioning, walking and running without creating any hip pain, but can significantly limit hip mobility. Alternatively, those from eastern Asia as well as some eastern European countries tend to have a socket that is set more laterally and less inferiorly, which means they have a greater ability to create a range of motion through something like a squat or hip hinge, but can't manage impact or max loading as easily. This is all to say we're all different and may respond to a different set up than someone right next to us. There's also the concept that both your left and right hip may be structurally different from each other, so your set up and approach may be better suited to be asymmetrical. Most people approach the deadlift with the intent on being perfectly symmetrical. The downside to this is we aren't designed to be perfectly symmetrical in our executions of movements. We typically have a dominant arm, a dominant leg, and a preferred pelvic position to start most movements. From working with my own clients, I've found that most predominantly have greater strength and stability in their left leg, greater range of motion but less control in their right leg, and a greater propensity to have the right knee collapse into valgus strain (moving towards the midline of the body) compared to the left, especially when the feet are lined up straight ahead. A slight variation in foot positioning can make a big difference in increasing glute activation, stability of the knee, foot arch formation, and core stabilization compared to setting up with both feet parallel. Typically all that is needed is a 10-20 degree turn out of the toes. It's a small thing, but it makes a huge difference. #4: Tongue Position and Heavy Action Singers have long known the role of tongue position in singing, not merely in altering sound production, but also in altering the strength and control of the diaphragm for power production. New Zealand rugby players knew it with their Hakka, Michael Jordan knew it's role in driving to the hoop, and medical professionals know about it as it relates to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems. In strength, letting the tongue simply flop around in the mouth reduces the tone of the neck muscles, which decreases cervical stability. As the shoulder blades are essentially hanging off the cervical spine, it's necessary to have some significant levels of stability at play.
Additionally, a lax tongue tends to lead to less tension being developed through the diaphragm, a muscle where strength and power is necessary during a heavy deadlift as it helps to increase intra-abdominal pressure and stabilize the spine. Specifically, the level of core activation seems to be highest when the tongue is pressed into the roof of the mouth. Interestingly, there's also correlation to pelvic floor activity when the tongue is pressed down into the bottom of the mouth, which could conceivably be helpful for women who have a history of pelvic floor issues when it comes to exercise, especially following childbirth. In yoga, pressing the tongue down into the lower palate is known as the Jiva Bandha position. When setting up for your lift, get tension through the entire system, breathe, and press your tongue into the roof of your mouth prior to pulling the weight off the floor. #5: Quit Jerking it Off When setting up for the lift, try to get maximal tension through your entire body, pulling the bar up into the plates to generate additional tension before you begin the movement phase. This is called “taking the slack out of the bar.”
Avoiding the jerk off the bottom of the movement can help maintain stability through the system and not wind up with you looking like you're going to get whiplash through the first pull. To summarize these 5 simple and effective hacks to prepare you for your deadlift: Pre-activate the lats Form tension through the foot in a neutral position Turn the right toe out slightly Push your tongue into the roof of your mouth Take the slack out of the bar. This is on top of all the normal set up and positional considerations needed to have a successful pull. I've used them with elite athletes (national, Olympic, and professional as well as division one and Canadian college athletes), rehabilitation clients, general population, and also myself. Following a significant low back and SI joint injury that saw the detachment of a major ligament, 3 disc bulges and a partial tear through the quadratus lumborum, I've had to re-learn and go through a trial and error phase to see what works and what doesn't These simple tips have helped me get back up to a double bodyweight deadlift, in spite of the restrictions of the injury.
According to the Premier League's official website, of the 115 permanent transfers (not counting free transfers) involving Premier League clubs this summer, only five were disclosed with any official figure, meaning that football fans spent their summers reading an increasingly unwelcome, yet familiar phrase: "... for an undisclosed fee."
The term is a perennial transfer window anticlimax: a well-trodden exercise in public relations, serving only to protect the agents, chairmen and directors of football. Put simply, an undisclosed transfer is designed to save face. Whether buying or selling, clubs need to be seen to be getting the best value for money and if there is even the smallest inkling that the sale or purchase price of a player for either of the two clubs might incur the wrath of either set of supporters, an undisclosed fire blanket is thrown over the top of the deal. Only when a club is happy with the fee will an official figure be announced, which amounted to 110, or 4.35%, of the permanent transfers this summer.
Never more apparent was this face-saving than in the sale of Marouane Fellaini from Everton to Manchester United on transfer deadline day. Having passed up the opportunity to sign Fellaini for his £23.5m buyout clause, United were forced to fork out £27.5m to persuade Everton to sell just a month later, making a mockery of the £28m joint bid for Fellaini and Leighton Baines, only two weeks ago. How does United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward sweep this one under the carpet? "An undisclosed fee", read the club's official statement. Except Everton, needing to explain the sale of a star player to their fans and presumably delighted about the extra £4m, could not resist letting the fee slip, leaving United red-faced.
Normally, when a deal isn't conducted with seconds to spare before the window shuts, the process is a lot more straightforward: clubs' press releases are painfully watertight, and the press "understand it to be in the region of", through "sources" that are well-placed. But without an official statement, fans can feel confused (figures for a deal can wildly differ: Santi Cazorla was quoted as moving to Arsenal for anything between £12m and £16.5m last year). The fundamental problem is that there seems to be a difference between doing something and owning up to doing that very same thing.
The fun of the transfer window remains in the foreplay of speculation rather than the main event. But there is a certain joy about knowing how much a player costs; in working out how many Michu's you can buy for a Neymar (25.5 apparently), or how much dearer the Manchester City squad was that lost to Wigan in May's FA Cup final. The success of Championship Manager, Football Manager and various fantasy football leagues is largely down to how well one can wheel and deal, tinkering with clearly priced players to build a winning team.
Why is there a lack of transparency? After all, a Premier League club's finances are laid bare every year, while gate and matchday income, merchandise and TV income, and commercial sponsorship are all widely available to anybody who cares to look. A breakdown of individual transfer fees remains largely hidden.
However, there must be a line drawn between disclosing transfer fees and disclosing wages. Wages are between a club and an individual and publicising that would divide a dressing room. No matter how astronomical, they should be under no more pressure to disclose their salary than you or me.
It may never have been more business-like, but football is a sport played, watched, and – with the advent of financial fair play, supposedly decreasing the influence of billionaire owners – paid for by the fans, whether it's done through Sky-shaped mediums, ticket-price hikes, or other means.
It is becoming a numbers game, increasingly crunched by Opta on the pitch, and by boardrooms off it. Fans have a lot invested in these players, be it emotionally or numerically – do they not deserve to know the figures their clubs are buying or selling these players for, or know if their chief executive is having their pants pulled down in the transfer market?
Privately-owned clubs will argue that they are under no obligation to share the ins and outs of the transfer window's ins and outs. But obligation is a subjective term – should a club serve its fans because it wants to or because it has to? For clubs wholly or partly owned by their fans, such as Barcelona and Real Madrid, or indeed nearly all German or Turkish clubs, fans should have access to their club's transfer fees, but are mostly denied this. Swansea City, who are 20% owned by their supporters, provided two of the five official figures mentioned at the top of this article – Wilfried Bony for £12m and Jordi Amat for £2.5m – but still withheld four undisclosed fees this summer. Is this enough?
Alas, with deals increasingly complicated with extra clauses and incentives, and agents becoming more influential, undisclosed fees look set to continue. But football clubs should be responsible for the transfers they voluntarily undertake, good and bad. Tottenham's Daniel Levy should be largely praised (if Tottenham's reported incomings and outgoings are to be believed), and Manchester United's Woodward criticised, for their respective dealings this summer. For fans who continue to stump up the cash as we ostensibly enter the era of financial fair play, accountability and transparency is key.
Corrupt Republican Beverly Masek to plead guilty to bribery
Masek will be the 11th conviction for the FBI in their ongoing investigation of Alaska's corrupt politicians (All Republicans so far)
Yet another dirty Alaska Republican will plead guilty Thursday to bribery.
Beverly Masek, a former state Representative from Willow, has agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to receive a bribe.
Masek, accepted at least $4,000 from corrupt former VECO CEO Bill Allen in 2003, according to documents filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Anchorage.
Beverly Masek's plea (PDF)
Masek killed an oil tax bill she had introduced after Allen told her it was "harmful" to his oil industry clients.
Under a plea bargain negotiated with prosecutors, Masek would only face a prison sentence of 18 to 24 months and a fine of $4,000 to $40,000. In Alaska the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit bribery is five years in jail and a $250,000 fine.

GREEN BAY, Wis. – The Crimson Tide-tinted friendship of Landon Collins and Ha Ha Clinton-Dix will be tested on Sunday at Lambeau Field.
Two of the game's top young safeties have known each other since college. Collins followed Clinton-Dix to Alabama, then to the NFL.
They will get together again this weekend when Clinton-Dix and the Green Bay Packers host Collins and the New York Giants in an NFC wild-card game .
"I hope he goes out and has a tremendous game, and also takes an 'L,'" Clinton-Dix said in a friendly voice.
It's been quite the season already for Collins and Clinton-Dix. They each have five interceptions, tying for the league lead among safeties. They have each been named to their first Pro Bowl. They both wear No. 21.
"We're like brothers. That's my boy," Collins said. "We train together and almost do everything together."
They don't have quite the same roles, though.
Listed at 6 feet, 225 pounds, the sturdy Collins plays strong safety in the Giants' stout secondary after being selected in the second round of the 2015 draft with the 33rd overall pick.
The 6-foot-1, 208-pound Clinton-Dix roams the field as a free safety for the Packers after being taken in the first round of the 2014 draft with the 21st overall pick.
The Packers might especially need Clinton-Dix to fulfill his big-play potential on Sunday, with the cornerback position beset by injuries just as Odell Beckham Jr., and the Giants' talented receiving corps arrive at Lambeau.
Quentin Rollins hasn't practiced this week because he's in the concussion protocol, while fellow cornerback Damarious Randall returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday after being limited earlier in the week by a knee injury.
"We just find ways to finish ballgames, we're finding ways to stick together," Clinton-Dix said Thursday. "We've been playing ball, man. We've just got to keep it up."
Just like in the teams' first meeting in October, when the Packers beat the Giants 23-16. Clinton-Dix posted a picture on Instagram after the game in which he exchanged his green-and-gold Packers jersey for Collins' white Giants jersey.
"We WILL be on TOP SOON! Nick Saban Safeties," Clinton-Dix wrote on Instagram, referring to the Tide's head coach.
Wearing a knit hat with Alabama's scripted "A'' logo after practice this week, Clinton-Dix spoke with pride about the strides that he and Collins have made this year.
"I see him ballin,' I also want to do it too. It's of kind of like — we always heard about 'Bama safeties not stepping up to the plate, or DBs period. That kind of put a chip on our (shoulders) as well," Clinton-Dix said. "We've been representing our program and where we come from well, so we've just got to continue doing it."
Collins had 125 tackles and four sacks in this breakthrough season. He's a big reason why the Giants defense has been playing so well late in the year, and why New York has the stingiest red-zone defense in the NFL (39.5 percent).
The biggest improvement over Collins' first two years in the league has been on the mental side of the game, Giants linebacker Jonathan Casillas said.
"It wasn't that he didn't have a high football IQ because he does, but it was that we gave him everything, we gave him the whole playbook and you got to call the defense," Casillas said. "Then you come in this year and you see what type of person, what type of player he is, because he has it down pat and he's not thinking once or twice about it and that's a tribute to him."
Packer safeties coach Darren Perry has seen similar improvement in Clinton-Dix. Reactions are quicker on the field, while Clinton-Dix is also cutting down on missed tackles, Perry said.
Clinton-Dix partners with Morgan Burnett to give the Packers' a strong duo at safety. Burnett said communication is so seamless now between them that the teammates can tell what last-minute adjustments the other safety might make by just making eye contact.
"I think the thing that you probably see now compared to his first couple years is that he's not afraid to make a mistake," Perry said recently about Clinton-Dix. "I think you see him trusting his eyes and it may not be perfect and they're not going to grade out 100 percent, and that's OK. The name of the game when you play the safety position is big hits and interceptions."
Portalarium announced an equity crowdfunding campaign to help alleviate their transition into publishing.
Shroud Of The Avatar, Portalarium's latest game release which is set to come out in a few months, comes on the heels of the company's decision to move forward with their transition from being a games developers to a publishing company.
Portalarium is an Austin-based games company. Their title Shroud of the Avatar is their first major project. The new game promises to mix the nuances of a strong, single-player narrative-driven story with the sandbox of massively multiplayer or MMOPRG games together in their upcoming, flagship title.
“We are forever grateful to our backers under our current funding campaign who have helped us reach levels of support that we never dreamed of having; that support has helped us develop Shroud of the Avatar to where it is today,” says Richard Garriott de Cayeux CEO of Portalarium. “And with a commercial launch now in sight, it's time to focus more on marketing and user acquisition as we scale up our player base and the service. It's also a chance for our supporters to invest in our company as we take this next critical step with equity crowdfunding.”
Shroud of the Avatar has industry veterans at the helm of its development, which includes the likes of Starr Long, who helped produce the game Ultima Online, and New York Times bestselling author Tracy Hickman, who wrote the popular Dragonlance series of fantasy novels.
Shroud of the Avatar began its crowdfunding in 2013, currently, the game is in early access with continuous support from the developers each month. The title has generated $11.6 million in crowd funding making Shroud of the Avatar the second highest fully crowdfunded game ever.
Asked how he got the assignment, he said, "I was volun-told: 'You're going up.' "
Wonfor also had praise for the Toronto police Emergency Task Force negotiator who scaled the crane along with him and talked to both the firefighter and the woman to help them remain calm.
"He was like a late-night talk show host, the way he talked, kept her really calm," Wonfor said, comparing the police officer's voice to that of the late legendary crooner Perry Como.
The initial plan was for Wonfor to climb up to the crane's block and make sure the woman didn't fall as it was lowered to a patch of grass in the nearby Paul Kane House Parkette.
But shortly after 8 a.m., concerns about lowering the block with two people on it prompted a change in plan. Instead, Wonfor placed the woman in a safety harness and secured her to him before rappelling to the ground below.
"It takes a lot of dexterity ... as our rescuers get cold, it gets harder on them," said Pegg, who described Wonfor as "one of our best."
The incident began at about 4 a.m., when police got a call that a person had been spotted on the crane.
The woman had apparently climbed onto the top of the crane, and then lowered herself onto the block using the cable from which it is suspended, Insp. Colin Greenaway said.
According to Pegg, a senior captain passed him following the woman's successful rescue and told him: "You know, there isn't a textbook for this, but I'm pretty sure we just wrote it."
Wonfor told reporters he didn't want to be late for his 11 a.m. hockey game where he plays goalie. In the locker-room, he got a call from Don Cherry, the outspoken legend of Coach's Corner.
"I just want to thank you," Wonfor says Cherry told him. "You're my type of guys here. Like the soldiers, like troopers, the police, the firefighters — guys. Boy, that was something. I know one thing, I'd never get that high and God love you and keep up the good work."

Hola. Esto me pasó hace algunos meses. Necesito contárselo a alguien.
To-do comenzó en la fiesta de un amigo. Él es un artista que tiene rentado un departamento en el parque industrial de la ciudad. Si sabes cómo se veía Detroit en 1920, sabes cómo se ve este lugar: un racimo de fábricas de hace más de un siglo que se abre paso a lo largo de unas diez cuadras. La mayoría están abandonadas.
Se me pasaron un poco las copas y me quedé dormido en uno de los sillones. Desperté alrededor de las 4 de la mañana, el sol aún no había salido pero las cosas ya se podían ver con la leve luz de esa hora. Anduve al baño caminando de puntitas, entre los huecos que otras personas repartidas por el suelo dejaban entre si. Mientras orinaba me asomé por la ventana del baño y me encontré con un paisaje desierto. Recuerdo cuanto solían gustarme los lugares así, sombríos y poblados de pistas sobre lo que alguna vez fueron; como detenidos a un momento de ser devorados por el tiempo.
Regresé a mi sillón, quería dormir un poco más. Después de 45 minutos de mirar hacia el techo entendí que no podría hacerlo, así que comiéndome mi orgullo decidí marcar a mi novia para pedirle un aventón; no podía pensar en regresar caminando con esa resaca. Siendo increíble, no tuvo problemas en ir por mí, me dijo que llegaría en más o menos media hora y que me llamaría cuando estuviera afuera. Mi teléfono se murió diez minutos después, así que decidí sentarme junto a la ventana para poder ver cuando llegara. Me senté ahí por un rato y mis párpados comenzaron a ponerse pesados.
Me despertó un golpe. No había sido fuerte, pero había bastado para devolverme a la realidad. Barrí con la vista el tramo de calle que se alcanzaba a ver desde la ventana: to-do estaba en calma, pero al otro lado de la acera, cerca de una montaña de bolsas negras y uno de esos enormes contenedores basura, me pareció distinguir la silueta de una torre y un monitor volcados sobre uno de sus costados. Hace un rato, no estaban ahí.
Cuando mi novia llegó, bajé para recibirla. Justo cuando estaba a punto de subirme al carro, recordé a un amigo mío al que la máquina se le había quedado sin fuente de poder, así que decidí ir a ver si podía conseguir refacciones gratis en la torre que había visto. El monitors no tenía esperanzas, pero la torre estaba casi intacta, así que la subí a la cajuela del carro de mi novia y nos fuimos.
Pasa alrededor de una semana y la verdad es que me olvido de la torre hasta que mi novia me llama para preguntarme si la quería o podía tirarla. Esa noche pasé por ella. Antes de desarmarla, decidí conectar mi monitor y ver si arrancaba. Para mi sorpresa, arrancaba. Windows XP, recién formateado. Hice algunas búsquedas típicas: “tits”, “pussy”, buscando algún escondrijo de pornografía olvidado por el antiguo dueño. Sin resultados. Luego busqué por tipos de archivo y reconocí uno con extensión .avi, llamado “barbie”, escondido en la carpeta WINDOWS/system32. Bingo.
Aquí es cuando las cosas comienzan a ponerse raras.
La película era de más o menos una hora y estaba compuesta por material exportado sin editar. Era una mujer sentada en una silla hablando delante de un fondo blanco. Adelanté el cursor del reproductor: la película entera nunca dejaba la misma toma. Una entrevista, un casting, pensé. Decidí correrlo desde el principio e intentar entender lo que la mujer decía. El audio estaba dañado y su voz era un ir y venir de estática acentuado por lo que asumí, era el ruido del ambiente. No entendí nada.
Así que abrí el video en Final Cut e intenté jugar con los niveles para aislar su voz. Ayudó un poco pero aún no entendía lo que estaba diciendo. A estas alturas estaba enganchado y había comenzado a prestar atención a su lenguaje corporal y su cara. Al parecer respondía preguntas, deteniéndose de cuando en cuando y prestando atención a alguien que le hablaba fuera de cuadro.
Entrados unos quince minutos de la cinta, su cara se enrojece y su rostro demuestra que las preguntas comienzan a molestarla… pero continúa respondiéndolas. Poco después, comienza a llorar. Solloza durante el resto de la cinta. Creo haber leído de sus labios la palabra “piel”, me parece que repite esta palabra varias veces a través del video y en cierto punto, incluso levanta un brazo para jalar de la de su brazo y pronunciar la palabra con un gesto que me pareció acomplejado.
Hay mucho más, pero se hace tarde y no puedo continuar. Compartiré el resto mañana. Dios se apiade de mi alma.

El video comienza a ponerse tenso a partir de ese punto; hacia los cuarenta minutos se encuentra llorando tan fuerte que es casi incapaz de mirar hacia la cámara, hasta que deja de hablar. Entonces baja la cabeza y comienza a llorar cubriéndose el rostro con las manos. Ni se levanta del asiento, ni se mueve. Entonces la pantalla se oscurece. Estaba muerto de curiosidad.
Reproduje el video entero varias veces esa noche, intentando encontrar inflecciones y matices en sus movimientos que pudieran revelar algo sobre lo que estaba pasando. Me sentía frustrado, quería saber más. Entonces noté que una vez que la pantalla oscurecía, el video seguía corriendo por varios minutos más. A dos minutos de concluir, había algo más, una imagen muy borrosa, pero distinguible.
Un par de piernas caminando sobre unas vías de tren. Da la impresión de que la cámara se ha encendido sin querer. La persona camina durante un rato sobre las vías y luego sale de ellas, hacia lo que parece un bosque. Ahí se interna por un camino hechizo de hierba compactada y tejas de madera. La persona sigue caminando hasta que el archivo concluye.
Mi corazón había comenzado a latir más rápido. Reconocía las vías de tren. Al menos parecían las del video. El lugar no estaba tan lejos. Tenía que ir. Debía de ir.
Llamé a mi amigo Ezra; una cosa de casi dos metros y ciento veinte kilos. Lo convencí de acompañarme “en un asunto”. No soy un maricón, pero creí que si me iba a meter al descampado inspirado en un video que encontré en una computadora botada a la mitad de la nada, ningún músculo extra me estorbaría. Toda la idea de investigar lo que había detrás de mi hallazgo me dejó sin dormir esa noche.
A la mañana siguiente, en un sábado soleado, puse una cámara, una linerna y mi ka-bar de siete pulgadas con terminado en negro mate y filo aserrado en una mochila y pasé por Ezra. Lo levanté, me abrió la puerta y en síntesis, me mandó al carajo. Ya había empacado y me encontraba hecho a la idea de lo que planeaba, así que decidí seguir con él o sin él. Estacioné mi carro cerca de la estación de tren, tomé mis cosas y comencé a caminar por las vías.
Caminé por unas dos horas. A un lado del camino vi un madero en el suelo que me recordó a los del video y las piernas se me doblaron de la impresión. Me alejé del camino y fui buscando hasta donde la hierba crecía más alta. Encontré el camino, se internaba por en medio del bosque. Caminé despacio, prestando mucha atención a mi alrededor. Me detenía de cuando en cuando, me arrodillaba y escuchaba en busca del sonido de alguna voz cercana, algo… había demasiado silencio. Esta era una de las cosas más tontas que había hecho nunca.
La densidad de árboles fue abriendose hasta un pequeño claro de hierba más baja. Di con una casa. Por la apariencia, nadie había vivido ahí en los últimos veinte o tal vez treinta años. Tomé algunas fotografías con mi cámara. Algunos metros más allá de la construcción principal había un cobertizo con techo de lámina. Me quedé un rato ahí, al comienzo del claro, tratando de entender lo que había encontrado. Atravesar a campo abierto era mostrarme a plena luz del día para cualquier par de ojos que estuvieran en la casa.
Me llevó un rato juntar los brios. Corrí acuclillado, por detrás de una cerca, pretendiendo que me dejara fuera de la vista. Empujé la puerta con la linterna y me alivió encontrar un interior más o menos iluminado. Guardé mi linterna, saqué la cámara y tomé algunas fotografías. No había muebles. El suelo estaba lleno de ladrillos, tejas de madera y pedazos de techo que se habían desprendido por la humedad; algunos de los muros tenían unos agujeros enormes. Más adentro en la casa, vi varias cosas a las que de momento no presté atención y que ahora me ponen de verdad nervioso:
Una puerta dentro de un cuarto contiguo al recibidor, que supongo baja al sótano, cerrada. Algunas sillas y una mesa plegable en el segundo piso. Destacaban porque parecían recién traídos. Pero en lo que de verdad sigo pensando es en el baño. El espejo estaba limpio. En la bañera había una cubierta gruesa, de plástico negro, que aún tenía gotas encima, recién lavada. Ese fue el momento en el que escuché un quejido largo que pareció atravesar toda la casa y el momento en el que descubrí que podía saltar de segundos pisos con la suficiente inspiración.
Llegué corriendo a las vías. Me llevé una mano a la cara y cerré los ojos, me sentí idiota: ¿estaba huyendo del sonido típico que un sistema viejo de tuberías?; ese pequeño momento de alivio y verguenza, dio paso a un instante mucho peor, cuando por fin mi mente dio con la pregunta ella sola: ¿quién estaba usando el agua de una casa abandonada a la mitad de la nada?
Han pasado poco más de dos meses desde que esto pasó, no he regresado ahí, ni planeo hacerlo.

The Hellenic Police was on Thursday coordinating with ELTA, the Greek postal service, in a bid to ensure that no further dangerous packages leave the country after parcel bombs were sent from Greece to German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and the offices of the International Monetary Fund in Paris.
The parcel bomb that arrived at the IMF's Paris office detonated, slightly injuring an employee there, on Thursday.
That came a day after a similar bomb arrived at Schaeuble's office but was defused before it could cause any injuries or damage.
Early on Thursday, the guerrilla group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility for sending the package to Schaeuble. In a statement on an anarchist website, the group said it “will continue stronger.” “Nothing is over,” it said, adding that it would provide more details in a proclamation to be issued in due course.
Citizens' Protection Minister Nikos Toskas confirmed on Thursday evening that the bomb sent to the IMF's Paris offices had been sent from Greece too. However, there had been no claim of responsibility for the Paris bomb by late Thursday.
Toskas said French authorities told him the sender cited on the package sent to the IMF's office was Vassilis Kikilias, the spokesman for conservative New Democracy and Toskas's predecessor at the ministry.
Similarly, German authorities had told their Greek counterparts on Wednesday that the parcel sent to Schaeuble bore the name of another member of ND, Adonis Georgiadis, as the sender.
Sources indicated that the bombs were similar, both comprising gun powder.
ELTA was on Thursday examining its security equipment at Athens International Airport to determine how the packages slipped through.
The attacks provoked condemnation from the head of the IMF, one of Greece's international creditors, and from the French government.
IMF chief Christine Lagarde denounced “this cowardly act of violence” and reaffirmed “the IMF's resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate.”
French President Francois Hollande said French authorities would trace the “persons responsible, and we will do it with tenacity, perseverance and until the end,” adding, “I want to tell all those who work for this great institution that we are by their side.”
Nearly 18 hours ago, a grinning jackass without pants ran onto the field during a Brewers-Giants game, and his reward was to get a knee jammed into the small of his back and road rash on his jumble-giblets. Because 18 hours is a year in internet time, I figured this was not a story that was going to appear on this site.
Also, the pictures we had in our photo tool were naughty:
So it goes. However, after seeing the pictures retweeted again on Friday morning, something kept gnawing at me.
The socks.
Why keep the socks on?
The socks.
Hey, buddy, what's going on with the socks? Got a second to talk about the socks? Listen, I won't take up too much of your time, but I gotta know about, whoops, there he goes.
I guess we need to retrace his steps.
Step 1: The decision
I think it is a good idea to take my pants off and show the world my grollies. This will bring me fame and fortune, and the endorphins alone will be worth the thousands of dollars in fines.
As of Step 1, our hero still has his socks on.
Step 2: The disrobing
We have to assume that he didn't go into a bathroom stall and then run down to the field, which means that he stood up and took his pants and underwear off in front of his entire section, exposing at least one young child to his basketwork.
I would imagine that it was in that rushed, ha-ha-hope-no-one-notices way. Except everyone noticed. Do you know how boring baseball games are? You notice when a hot dog wrapper floats by. You definitely notice when there's a pasty, flat butt in your face.
But before the pants come off, the shoes had to come off.
And after the shoes come off, there's probably a natural instinct to peel off the socks at the same time.
No. I need to keep these on.
GAAAAHHHHHHH BUT WHY? Retracing his steps doesn't help.
None of these helps.
Maybe if we rank the possible ideas and search for Occam's Razor?
Dirty feet? Yuck. Forgot Cold toes Dunno Feet are just gross in general, and nobody wants to see that.
None of these is perfect. But I'm going with “Dunno.” The logic lobe isn't pulsing with the strength needed to keep him out of jail, so I'm not sure why I'm expecting it to work when it comes to taking socks off.
Before we go, I wanted to share this site, which was obviously created as a condition of this field stormer's plea deal. The name of the site:
Running the Field Don't Do It
It includes both the words “Now that my charges have been dropped” and an awesome picture, so maybe it isn't the best deterrent. But there are words of caution:
In case you ignore my advice above and decide to run the field anyway, PLEASE DO NOT STREAK. DO NOT EXPOSE YOURSELF. They will add on additional charges, and from what I've heard, they are not one bit pretty.
No, nothing about this is pretty. And after writing about this for a few minutes, I'm no closer to my initial goal.
Why would you keep your socks on?
Tell me about the socks.
I need to know about the socks.
Nintendo's home console can be yours for just $299.99 starting September 20, the house of Mario announced today. That's a $50 price cut for a console that's about to get a steady flow of Nintendo-made games but that's been struggling to sell at even half the pace of its predecessor.
The Wii U will sell in two models: the existing black deluxe model bundled with the pretty-good game compilation Nintendo Land or in a new Zelda model. An image of the latter leaked last week.
That Zelda console is black, but its GamePad controller is etched with Zelda-style script The bundle will also include vouchers to download a digital (duh) copy of the Hyrule Historia Zelda lore book and a copy of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD.
Both consoles include 32GB of on-board flash memory. The system can be connected to self-powered hard-drives for more storage capacity.
"Obviously we want to drive Wii U momentum," Fils-Aime said of the reasoning behind the price drop. "We've been very clear that software is what drives hardware. And we feel very good about the line-up of software for Wii U. Taking the added step to improve the value just reinforces our commitment to make sure that Wii U has a strong holiday this year and is set up to be a strong platform into the future."

The Wii U has been struggling to catch on in its first year, a fact Nintendo, to their credit, isn't trying to hide.
"All you need to do is look at the numbers," Fils-Aime said. "At this point in time the Wii install base was beginning to approach three million—this is U.S. numbers—and as we sit here today, the Wii U installed base is at about 1.5 million. So clearly the sales pace is different. But I will also tell you that the focus on making sure that this holiday—its second holiday—is really strong is actually quite consistent with the way we've always thought about our hardware launches."
Nintendo has all but phased out the white 8GB version of the Wii U, a system that retailers seemed to begin dumping this past spring. That "basic" version of Nintendo's console had originally sold for $299, sans pack-in game. "That has largely sold through in the marketplace," Fils-Aime said. "There is not much of that particular configuration out and we don't expect there to be much at all come September 20."

Nintendo has not announced plans to bring a white 32 GB version of the unit to North America.
For comparison's sake, PlayStation 3s and Xbox 360s in their various hard drive and game-bundle configurations range from $200-$300. The November 15-launching PS4 will cost $400. The November-launching Xbox One will sell for $500.
China has one of the biggest Windows XP user bases in the world, and shaking this addiction seems to be more difficult than people could have imagined. Now, even the government is getting involved and is asking Windows XP users to switch to a Linux solution, preferably something made in China.
Microsoft decided to end support for Windows XP, which means that the Chinese users who still rely heavily on this operating system face a serious problem. Some of them are not willing to upgrade or they don't have the means to. This excludes all those using pirated versions.
Things are starting to get serious in China because the Windows XP-powered computers are becoming more and more vulnerable with each passing day, and the authorities still don't have a solution.
“We want users to pay attention to the potential security risk brought by their Windows XP system as Microsoft ceased providing further patch services. At the same time, the ministry will work on developing China's own computer system and applications based on Linux and we hope that the users will give more support to these domestically made products,” said Zhang Feng, chief engineer of MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information of Technology), according to a report by ecns.cn.
Zhang Fen, one of the few people in China who seem to have the right numbers, says that almost 70% of the computers in the country have Windows XP installed, including authorities from local governments.
The issue of migrating people from Windows XP to a Linux system was even presented on the China Central Television, which is the main broadcaster in the mainland. Numerous experts from China's Ministry of Industry and Information of Technology expressed their concerns, but they also explained that Linux was not ready to receive new users.
“Linux only accounts for 1 percent or less of the global market. It's natural that commercial companies are unwilling to develop software that adapts to this platform,” also said Hu Changjun, a representative the Ministry of Industry and Information of Technology.
Some of the main applications employed by the regular Chinese users are not supported on Linux and the developers are not willing to make the necessary changes. The government officials also noted that other countries were already taking the appropriate steps towards Linux, like Russia and Germany.
One of the main problems in China is the fact that the users don't have a major Linux distro to adopt. However, Ubuntu Kylin, which is only just starting to gather a following, might prove to be a good option in the coming months.
Mayor John Tory "wants more information" from the federal government about its decision to scrap the Public Transit Tax Credit in Wednesday's budget.
The credit was worth about $200 for those who pay upwards of $113 per month for transit.
In announcing the move in its latest budget, the government said the credit was "ineffective in encouraging the use of public transit and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
Don Peat, spokesperson for Tory, said the mayor is "very concerned" about keeping transit affordable for residents.
"The mayor wants more information from the federal government about why that public transit tax credit decision was made," Peat said in a statement to CBC News.
"One of the arguments we've heard so far is that there was low uptake on the credit. The mayor has also asked TTC staff to try to determine the impact of what eliminating this tax credit would mean for our transit system."
TTC spokesperson Brad Ross would only say Thursday morning that staff will conduct an analysis and "likely report back to the TTC board at its next meeting."
Asked about the move during an event in Toronto Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said investing in new transit lines and bus routes and generally improving service is more important for Canadians.
"The issue with the tax credit is that it was very complex, there was extremely low take-up and the money is better spent actually investing in better opportunities for more people to take transit," Trudeau said.
Asked to respond to Tory and other critics who say eliminating the credit is a disincentive to taking transit, Trudeau said not everyone has the option of driving to work.
"We know that investing in public transit; investing in reliable, safe and regular public transit that responds to the needs of Canadians who have to get to school, to work and get home in time to care for their kids and have a quality of life, is essential," the prime minister said. "And that's exactly the focus we've made in investing in the right kinds of things that are going to create those greater opportunities for communities, for citizens and for economic growth."
The federal budget included $20.1 billion over 11 years for transit projects across the country.
'There's no point in taking it anymore'
While Trudeau suggested that low uptake was partly responsible for the decision to scrap the credit, transit riders in Toronto Thursday were disappointed.
"Commuting is not easy: limited seating, [being] shoved, pushed, you're bound by schedules, they're late. And the only tax break that the 'Working Joe' has is 'Okay, I can put it on my income tax and now I can't do it anymore,'" Rose Clavet told CBC Toronto's Linda Ward at Union Station.
Clavet said the credit helped reduce her burden at tax time, which means she will have to re-arrange her budget. The decision will also encourage her to drive and park downtown, she said.
"There's no point in taking it anymore," she said.
David Lord, who commutes by GO Transit every day, said with transportation costs going up, he will work from home more.
"I always thought the break was a good thing," Lord said. "We're getting squeezed every penny that we have and that we're earning right now."
Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa, himself expected to hand down a provincial budget soon, said Thursday that he could not speak to the federal government's reasoning behind the decision. But he told CBC Radio's Metro Morning that "we need to provide support and encouragement" for public transit use.
Asked whether he would consider bringing in a similar credit in his next budget or provide relief in another way, Sousa would only say he is considering his options.
"I've taken a look at a tax credit specifically for the use of public transit, but I am looking at ways to make it easier and more effective to use public transit," Sousa said.

In November, Yasuhiro Hanatani, Tatsuya Aoki and Hiroyoshi Manome made the first ascent of the highly sought-after South Pillar of Kyashar (6769mm) in the Khumbu region of Nepal's Mahalangur Himal. The Japanese team is calling the 2000m route Nima Line (ED+: 5.10a M5). The word "Nima" means "sun" in Nepali, and the climbers decided on the name after experiencing near-perfect weather conditions during their six days of climbing. While their route wasn't incredibly hard, the terrain itself proved to be challenging because of so much loose rock and unconsolidated snow on the ridge. Since 2001, eight teams have attempted climbing the Kyashar's South Pillar via several different routes. All were turned around for various reasons.

In first three days of climbing, the trio navigated pitch after pitch of loose and blocky rock. It wasn't until the fourth day on the route that they reach good rock, but they were quickly confronted with sugary, unconsolidated snow and spent two hours digging a bivy spot for the night. On the fifth day, they were confronted with a decision to continue through the dangerous, 80-degree snow ridge or retreat. If they continued, they would not be able to turn around. Ultimately, they chose to keep moving, albeit, slowly. It took them all day to climb five pitches over most of the cruddy snow. On their sixth and final day, the team summited at four in the afternoon in perfect conditions. They bivied at 6250m and descended via the west ridge the following day, finally encountering snowy and windy weather.

Yasuhiro Hanatani is currently in Tokyo awaiting his first-born baby. He says he will be taking about a month off between his successful ascent and mountain guiding. This year he plans to climb the south side of Gurja Himal.
Hanatani is no stranger the Himalayan climbing. In 2004 he was part of an expedition that brought him to 6100m up the Shark's Fin of Meru (6310m), but before they could complete the route, Hanatani took a fall, breaking both his legs. He returned two year later with the same team to complete the second ascent of the peak.

A group of researchers with the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan (U-M) found in a new study that people who are infected with the herpes virus can experience a higher incidence of cognitive impairment over the course of their entire lifetimes.
The current research effort was centered on young adolescents, ages 12 through 16, and is the first study ever to investigate such a correlation in this age group. The incidence of two types of herpes virus, Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and cytomegalovirus (CMV), was studied, the group says.
The team also included two other age groups, 20 to 59 and beyond 60. The scientists then analyzed how cognitive impairment was distributed throughout these groups, in correlation to the strain of herpes virus the participants were infected with, and the age when the original infection occurred.
Data for this research was collected from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Details of the study appear in a paper published in the latest issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
The oral herpes virus, HSV-1, has been demonstrated years ago to play a role in the development of a variety of neurological disorders in the older population, including dementias and Alzheimer's disease. However, no research had been conducted to determine if these effects begin early on in life.
“This study is a first step in establishing an association between these viruses and cognition across a range of ages in the U.S. Population,” says U-M associate professor of epidemiology Allison Aiello.
Scientists were able to determine that children (ages 12 to 16) obtained lower average reading and spatial reasoning test scores if they were infected with HSV-1. In adults, the viral agent caused decreases in visual motor speed and attention. Older adults were affected with memory impairment.
“If HSV-1 begins to have impact on cognitive function early in life, HSV-1 infection in childhood may have important consequences for educational attainment and social mobility across the lifespan,” explains University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Assistant Professor of epidemiology Amanda Simanek, who was previously an assistant research scientist in the U-M Department of Epidemiology.
Currently, official statistics show that more than 33 percent of the entire population of the United States is infected by one of the two strains of the herpes virus. Infection usually occurs during early childhood.
“Once acquired, herpes viruses are never cleared from the body and instead persist in a latent state. Such pathogens are, however, subject to reactivation and capable of invading the central nervous system, where they may exert direct damage to brain,” Simanek concludes.

1/31/2015 – Together with the six players of the leading elite, there will join in a group of legendary personalities from the world of chess at the 4th edition of the «Zurich Chess Challenge 2015» (February 13th-19th 2015). Recently added to the mouthwatering activities is a Legends Match in rapid games between Viktor Korchnoi and Wolfgang Uhlmann. The event just gets better and better.
The GM's Nigel Short, Jan Rogers, Gennadi Sosonko and Ljubomir Ljubojevic will support GM Yannick Pelletier and IM Werner Hug as guest commentators in the worldwide live broadcast.
Leonxto Garcia from Spain, Frédéric Friedel (Chessbase, Germany) and many more journalists from over the world are going to report about this tournament of superlatives.
Among the Who's Who at the Opening Ceremony (February 13th) on the stage of this great event at Zurich will be not only Arturo Pérez-Reverte, the Spanish author of the detective novel «La tabla de Flandes» («The Flanders Panel», a dialogue between literature, painting and chess) but also the world renowned Cellist Boris Andrianov, the first Russian cellist to become a laureate at the 6th International Rostropovich competition in Paris.
Though a classical musician by trade, here Boris Andrionov teams up with Dmitri Illarionov to play a special
transcription of the great Argentinian Artur Piazzola's Muerte Del Ángel. Absolutely brilliant.
They will attune the six competitors at this closed ceremony (but broadcasted live) to the Blitz Tournament which will decide over the color distribution for the classical games. Following the Rapid Tournament on the final day (February 19th), the public Closing Ceremony with a musical contribution of the «Trio Capriccio Zürich» and the Prize Giving Ceremony will end this extraordinay chess festival.
The supporting programme features Sergej Karjakin who will be playing a simultaneous exhibition against representatives of the sponsors at the «Zunfthaus zur Saffran» on February 12th.
Korchnoi - Uhlmann rapid match
Furthermore, we are particularily looking forward to a Rapid Competition between the two famous chessplayers Viktor Kortchnoi and Wolfgang Uhlmann who both made a lasting impression on the chess scene at their height. They will celebrate their 84th and 80th birthday respectively in March 2015! This event will be held on February 15th (rounds one and two) and February 16th (rounds three and four), both days at 11am at the Hotel "Savoy Baur en Ville" and preceded by a short overview about the bygone chess history by the president of the «Emanuel Lasker Gesellschaft», Paul Werner Wagner.
Viktor Korchnoi was a candidate for the World Championship on ten occasions (1962, 1968, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1988 and 1991). He was also a four-time USSR chess champion, a five-time member of Soviet teams that won the European championship, and a six-time member of Soviet teams that won the Chess Olympiad. On the January 2007 FIDE rating list Korchnoi was ranked number 85 in the world at age 75, by far the oldest player ever to be ranked in the FIDE top 100. The second-oldest player on the January 2007 list was Alexander Beliavsky, age 53, who is 22 years younger than Korchnoi. As of 2011, Korchnoi was still active in the chess world with a notable win (in Gibraltar) with black against the 18-year-old Fabiano Caruana, who was rated above 2700 and 61 years Korchnoi's junior. Viktor Korchnoi
Wolfgang Uhlmann was a dominant force in East German chess, winning the GDR (or East German) national championship on eleven occasions from 1954 to 1986. The number eleven repeated again, when as the GDR's most outstanding player at the Chess Olympiads of 1956–90, he made eleven appearances, mostly on top board. At the 1964 event in Tel Aviv, he scored 83.3 percent, earning him the individual board one gold medal. It was during the 1960s and 1970s that Uhlmann made a lasting impression on the international tournament scene with wins alongside greats such as Smyslov, Spassky and Bronstein to name but a few. Uhlmann is acknowledged as one of the world's leading experts on the French Defence, and is one of very few Grandmasters to have deployed it almost exclusively in reply to 1.e4. Wolfgang Uhlmann
This tournament is made possible again by the generous support of Oleg Skvortsov,
owner of the «International Gemological Laboratories» in Moscow and a passionate
strong chess player with good personal relationships to the entire world elite of chess.

SOME THOUGHTS ON PRIVILEGE
Okay, this is a long post.
You don't have to read it.
It's about my thoughts on empathy and privilege and what we are allowed to discuss and not discuss, and whether – in certain cases – political correctness has – against all odds – gone a little mad, if that is possible.
It might be controversial, but I hope it isn't. I'm aiming for questioning. I'm aiming for that feeling I like happening in my own mind, of an established thought being illuminated in a slightly different way. The opening of a mind.
I have thought a lot about privilege this year. My own, and other peoples. Partly this is because earlier this year I proposed a book on masculinity and how fixed concepts of gender harm men, and got a lot of quite brutal animosity from a lot of people for even suggesting that men might have it hard in certain ways. The kind of animosity that gets covered in The Guardian and The Independent and gets people to still post me about it months later.
While the patriarchy benefits men economically and socially, there may be some kind of emotional fallout.
In one sense, this controversy ‘worked' in my favour. I got offered three big book deals in a week and lots of publicity. I even trended on Twitter for a minute or two. Whoo. Some saw it as part of a master plan. Others, less ridiculously, saw the furore itself as an example of male privilege in action.
Anyway, after much deliberation, I can safely say that book won't be written, because I really can't be doing with the grief. But it is still an issue close to my heart. And it is not an issue close to my heart because I care about men more than women, or that I don't believe in privilege, but because I believe that the concept of masculinity as taught to men by men and by women and by everything from the Army through to Toys R Us, is a damaging and ridiculous thing that hurts women as much as men.
The idea of the strong, silent, providing male is the reason why the gender pay gap exists. It is also, in my view, the reason why more men kill themselves. The issue of masculinity is tied intrinsically with the problems of femininity. And I know that feminism has to be led by women, and I am not trying to be John Stuart Mill here, but as ‘lived experience' seems to be a key criterion to writing about sensitive issues I do believe my lived experience of being a man who never fit into the right masculine box, has something to offer. I also believe it is impossible to talk about gender in isolation.
Anyway, instead of a book here are some thoughts on how the current discussion of privilege can itself have dehumanising effects:
1. We live in a patriarchy. Most human societies on Earth have been shown to be patriarchal and have patriarchal origins. This means men have traditionally had the roles of power and provision, while women have been subjugated by society towards a more domestic and nurturing role. Maybe ‘subjugated' is the wrong word. We must be careful to not view gender equality in masculine terms. Maybe the traditionally ‘feminine' roles of parenthood and nurturing should be valued as much, if not more, than the ‘masculine' values of work and provision. But there are large inequalities and uneven expectations which patriarchal values continue to inflict. For instance, the gender pay gap means that women still earn nearly 20% less than men. And you only have to look at the ratio of male:female ratio of CEOs to see the shine in the glass ceiling. I think by broadening the idea of masculinity to the extent that those roles previously perceived as ‘feminine' are never seen as demeaning would lead to happier more equal homes AND workplaces.
2. Even in a patriarchy men can have problems. Indeed, as someone who believes true individual happiness depends on other people being happy oppression of 51% of the population is going to have knock-on effects on the other 49%. Men and women are not separate species. But aside from that, there are other ways society harms men. For instance, four times as many men as women kill themselves. Nine out of ten homeless people are men. Men still die younger than women. Men are more likely to be addicts. 79% of murder victims are male. Men are more likely to end up in prison. Many of these things change widely between countries and eras, so they are CULTURAL. So to shrug and just say, as many have said to me, ‘men kill themselves more because they choose more violent methods' seems a bit of an empathy and sympathy failure. Especially when, in the UK of thirty years ago the numbers of suicides between genders was roughly equal. We can therefore do massive amounts to stop the main cause of death for men under 50, yet we don't, for fear of looking sexist.
3. I am a heterosexual white male. I am dripping in privilege.
4. And yet I have still recognised privileges even greater than mine. For instance, a heterosexual white male going to Eton might have more privilege than one going to the failing comp in Nottinghamshire that I went to, where there was very little expectation on any of us to go to university. Maybe a woman or person-of-colour going to Eton has more privileges, on balance, than a soft white boy amid the downwardly mobile school I went to. (One of the comments I got on Twitter was: ‘fuck off back to Eton white boy'.) But then, going to a better school than I did does not make you immune to problems either. I think we should always see the human first. As scary as it might sound, even Donald Trump is a human being capable of feeling pain and hurt. That doesn't mean he won't inflict pain and hurt. But if we insist on seeing the human in everyone, always, even while condemning their actions, the human might shine back. And maybe if Donald Trump had been given a more flexible idea of what being a man is – one that isn't about earning money and objectifying women – maybe his attitudes would be a little warmer and saner.
5. The first time Hitler wrote about the Jews, in a letter from 1919, he used the word ‘privilege'. We need to be careful of that word. It has dehumanising effects. That is not to say we shouldn't recognise it and see the harm it causes, just that we shouldn't use it as a shortcut to not caring about any group of humans (the posh, the male, the literate, whatever).
6. Caring about one thing (say, the number of male suicides) does not automatically mean you can't care about another thing (say, the number of female victims of rape). We don't have to wall off our empathy.
7. Men indisputably belong to the more violent gender. But how do we stop that violence? Yes, violence can be a product of power structures but it can also be a product of impotence and frustration. Happy men are not violent men. Working on ways to improve men's mental health will surely improve a lot of the issues that women have to deal with. This was the most explosive thing I ever pointed out on Twitter, but I stand by it.
8. We must never break down groups of humans into competing teams. I think the main problems of being human – that we can become ill, that we can experience pain and loss, that we are going to die – are utterly universal. We all deserve massive sympathy and love and congratulations simply for the privilege of being alive.
9. If you are connected to the internet and if you can read this you are privileged. But that doesn't mean you can't have a problem that needs addressing. We all need love, we can all feel pain, especially in tough social and economic times, but we should always try to resist becoming the monster even as we fight the monster (sorry Nietzsche). We are all good and all evil. The entire human race is all of us. As Philip K Dick said ‘we are all stations in the same mind'. Let's see us all as one. Let's try and understand before we hate. Let's try a little love.
10. That's it.
In recent years, scientists have found out all sorts of remarkable things about a group of creatures that are entirely invisible to the naked eye: the trillions of bacteria that colonize every surface of our bodies.
These organisms—collectively known as the microbiome—deeply affect our health, governing our intake of fat, our likelihood of developing allergies and even how often we get bitten by mosquitoes.
New science, though, is indicating that the relationship goes both ways. These microorganisms affect us, but our underlying genetics also control which species of bacteria are able to thrive in and on our bodies.
One of the most striking examples of this was published today in the journal PLOS ONE. In the study, a group of researchers from Ohio State University analyzed the species of bacteria that lived in the mouths—either in saliva, on tooth surfaces or under gums—of 192 volunteers.
By sequencing all of the bacterial DNA present in a sample swabbed from each person's mouth, the researchers detected 398 different bacteria species in total. Each volunteer, on average, harbored 149 different species of oral bacteria.
But perhaps the most interesting finding was that there was a tremendous amount of diversity between individuals—only 8 species were present in every single participant's mouth. “No two people were exactly alike. That's truly a fingerprint,” Purnima Kumar, the study's lead author, said in a press statement.
This bacterial diversity, though, wasn't entirely random: It correlated with the ethnic group of the volunteer. In other words, people from each of the four different ethnic groups represented in the study (all participants self-identified as either Caucasian, African-American, Chinese or Latino) generally had similar species of bacteria, especially underneath the gums.
As a result, simply by counting which varieties of bacteria appeared in this area, the researchers developed a model that was able to guess a person's ethnicity with an accuracy significantly better than chance—it got it right 62 percent of the time. Some groups were even easier to identify via the bacteria than others: It could correctly identify Latinos 67 percent of the time and African-Americans with 100 accuracy.
The variation along ethnic lines, they believe, is a reflection of genetics, not environment. That's because, if you assumed that the mouth microbiome is totally dependent on environmental factors, you'd expect that members of the same ethnic group would have different mixes of bacteria depending on whether they were first-generation immigrants to the U.S. or had family histories that stretched back generations in the country. Instead, people's background—in terms of foods they ate and other lifestyle trends—didn't seem to have any correlation with the bacterial communities in their mouths. But their ethnicity and thus their similar genetics matched their microbiome more often than chance.
Interestingly, the original goal of this research wasn't to find new differences between people from different ethnic groups, but to examine the bacterial traits shared between people with good oral health (the researchers are mostly from OSU's School of Dentistry). But when the researchers analyzed the data, they were struck by the ethnic similarities. Although they sampled bacteria from all regions of the mouth, those found under the gumline had the strongest correlation to ethnicity (and thereby genetics), likely because they're the least disrupted by environmental factors such as diet or smoking.
The surprising ethnic finding could yield benefits for oral health. The fact that people of different ethnicities harbor different sorts of oral bacteria could lead to medical treatments that are tailored to a patient's genetic background. If research eventually reveals that someone with certain oral bacteria species in high quantities is predisposed to certain ailments, for example, he or she could be proactively screened for these diseases.
NY Times: Say, Why Isn't The DNC Trying To Thwart The Election Results?
Uber-partisan hacks David S. Cohen, a law professor and Hillary supporter, and Dalia Lithwick, a moonbat writer from the always reliably nutball site Slate, really really want the DNC and high ranking Democrats to fight back and deligitimize the election of Donald Trump, overturning the election. At some point, you have to realize that this is the view of the people who work and run the NY Times, as well
As Monday's Electoral College vote approaches, Democrats should be fighting tooth and nail https://t.co/ggqfB4smGc pic.twitter.com/aqvhEjfVI2 — NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) December 14, 2016

Do you like how they used a graphic where the entire country is painted blue for Democrats?
Buck Up, Democrats, and Fight Like Republicans On Monday, members of the Electoral College will vote in Donald J. Trump as president. Though he lost the election by nearly three million votes and almost daily generates headlines about new scandals, the Democratic Party is doing little to stop him. If you've been asking yourself “Where are the Democrats?” you're not alone. Since the election, top Democrats have been almost absent on the national stage. Rather, they have been involved largely in internecine warfare about how much to work with Mr. Trump. The Hillary Clinton campaign, trying to encourage a peaceful transition, has gone almost completely dark, with her most notable appearances coming in selfies with strangers. Nobody deserves downtime more than Mrs. Clinton, but while she is decompressing, the country is moving toward its biggest electoral mistake in history.
Then maybe Democrats should have nominated someone better, right?
There's no shortage of legal theories that could challenge Mr. Trump's anointment, but they come from outsiders rather than the Democratic Party. Impassioned citizens have been pleading with electors to vote against Mr. Trump; law professors have argued that winner-take-all laws for electoral votes are unconstitutional;
Since when? If that was the case, Democrats would be in big trouble, because what you'd see are lots of electoral votes in states that typically go Democrat splitting those votes, since in places like NY and NJ there are large swaths of non-urban areas that voter Republican. Be careful what you wish for. But, hey, if the shoe was reversed, these same people would be telling us to respect the system.
a small group, the Hamilton Electors, is attempting to free electors to vote their consciences; and a new theory has arisen that there is legal precedent for courts to give the election to Mrs. Clinton based on Russian interference. All of these efforts, along with the grass-roots protests, boycotts and petitions, have been happening without the Democratic Party. The most we've seen is a response to the C.I.A. revelations, but only with Republicans onboard to give Democrats bipartisan cover.
Yeah, remember all the riots, violence, and caterwauling from Democrat voters, with Democrats saying nothing to stop them.
Contrast the Democrats' do-nothingness to what we know the Republicans would have done. If Mr. Trump had lost the Electoral College while winning the popular vote, an army of Republican lawyers would have descended on the courts and local election officials. The best of the Republican establishment would have been filing lawsuits and infusing every public statement with a clear pronouncement that Donald Trump was the real winner. And they would have started on the morning of Nov. 9, using the rhetoric of patriotism and courage.
No, Republicans wouldn't. They would have sucked it up just like they sucked up 8 years of Obama. The partisan hack writers attempt to use Florida 2000 as the rationale, but, the situation was different. But, it did give them a chance to whine about Florida 2000.
As Monday's Electoral College vote approaches, Democrats should be fighting tooth and nail. Instead, we are once again left with incontrovertible proof that win or lose, Republicans behave as if they won while Democrats behave as if they lost. What this portends for the next four years is truly terrifying.
We did win. The White House, the House, the Senate, a goodly chunk of the state legislatures and executive offices, local races, county races, judge races, sheriff races, and, by extension (well, I guess we'll see who Trump nominates), the Supreme Court.
Democrats say they love our country and democracy and respect our Constitution, but, the only thing they love is power. And will pull any shenanigans to achieve it. It's going to be a long 4-8 years with these people writing stuff like this, but, they give great copy for posts, wouldn't you say?

Louise Mensch, the Conservative MP and one of parliament's more active Twitter users, has backed David Cameron's call for social networking services to be shut down temporarily during civil disorder.
Mensch, the MP for Corby and East Northamptonshire and a novelist, used Twitter to call for a "brief temporary shutdown" of Twitter and Facebook to stop unfounded rumours being spread, as she said had occurred in Northamptonshire last week during the riots that spread from London to several cities across England.
"Common sense. If riot info and fear is spreading by Facebook & Twitter, shut them off for an hour or two, then restore. World won't implode," she said.
On her Twitter feed, she added: "Northamptonshire police advise me that much of their time and resources were wasted answering false alarms due to soc media rumours. At the time, tweeted people should think hard before putting the phrase 'rumours of' into a tweet. Nonsense rumours about W'boro [Wellingborough] = 999 calls."
"I don't have a problem with a brief temporary shutdown of social media just as I don't have a problem with a brief road or rail closure. If short, necessary and only used in an emergency, so what. We'd all survive if Twitter shut down for a short while during major riots."
However, Greater Manchester police backed the use of social networks, saying they have allowed authorities to correct rumours before they gather momentum.
Kevin Hoy, web manager at Greater Manchester police, said Twitter allowed them to give "direct reassurance" and "dispel rumours … in a way that we could never have achieved previously".
said Twitter had been an "overwhelmingly positive" and "vital" channel of communication as violence spread across the region. It has urged its 95,000 Twitter followers to "name and shame" suspected rioters in CCTV images it has posted online.
Devon and Cornwall police warned against a kneejerk reaction to claims that Facebook, Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger played a key role in organising disorder across the country.
A force spokesman said: "You have to deal with these things in proportion. Putting someone's door in because of something they posted on Facebook is clearly not proportionate, but speaking to their parents and giving them advice is proportionate. It has the desired effect and we stand by that."
David Cameron said on Thursday the intelligence agencies and police were exploring whether it was "right and possible" to cut off those "plotting violence, disorder and criminality" on social networks. The home secretary, Theresa May, is to hold talks with all major social networks about their responsibility in times of civil unrest.
All three social networks said they would welcome a meeting with May. Facebook said it had boosted its internal team to monitor potentially inflammatory messages and had actively removed several "credible threats of violence" from the website.
But there are questions about whether disconnecting people is necessary and whether or not it is technically feasible.
Police across the country have arrested a number of people accused of organising or inciting violence on social networks.
Devon and Cornwall police made its first arrest on Friday over comments posted by those suspected of inciting violence on social networks. The force has given "words of advice" to eight people, all under 25, over messages posted online.
"If we know they are inciting crime in that way, then we know we can get across to them on the medium that they are using. I would suggest it works because either [inflammatory messages] have been taken down or no disorder has come of them," the spokesman said.
He said Facebook users had taken it upon themselves to "show a sense of social responsibility" and report inflammatory pages this week, resulting in them to be shut down.
Current powers allow police to order mobile phone companies to free up space on their networks for people attempting to call emergency services. However, this is seen as a last resort.
O2 denied accusations that it turned off parts of its network in London during the unrest.
Americans scrapped 4 million more cars and trucks last year than they purchased, the first significant drop in the U.S. auto fleet in more than four decades, according to a new report.
The United States scrapped 14 million vehicles last year while buying only 10 million new ones, dropping the nation's fleet from an all-time high of 250 million to 246 million, according to the Earth Policy Institute.
Lester Brown, the author of the report, said the drop -- the first significant shrinkage the U.S. fleet has seen since record-keeping began in 1960 -- represents a "cultural shift away from the car" and estimated the fleet size will continue to recede during the next decade. He estimated the fleet could shrink a total of 10 percent by 2020.
"No one knows how many cars will be sold in the years ahead, but given the many forces at work, U.S. car sales may never again reach the 17 million that were sold each year between 1999 and 2007," Brown said. "Sales seem more likely to remain between 10 million and 14 million per year."
The report comes one day after the automakers posted sales numbers for December, a month that showed a small but significant uptick in sales and brought a close to what has been one of the worst years in the history of the industry.
Brown said this summer's federal Cash for Clunkers program, which paid Americans to scrap old cars and trucks for newer, more fuel-efficient ones, played only a small role in the downward trend because it accounted for roughly 700,000 cars. "It has an effect but a minor one," he said.
Instead, Brown attributed the drop to a number of other factors and stressed that it was being driven by more than just the current economic recession, which is widely seen as the major cause of the recent sales slump that has plagued the auto industry.
Among the reasons cited in the report were market saturation caused by more registered vehicles than licensed drivers, economic and environmental concerns, and a shift away from the importance and prestige of the automobile in the youth culture.
"Perhaps the most fundamental social trend affecting the future of the automobile is the declining interest in cars among young people," Brown said. "Many of today's young people living in a more urban society learn to live without cars. They socialize on the Internet and on smart phones, not in cars."
Assuming the fleet downsizing continues, Brown said it would cut long-term oil demand and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which currently accounts for roughly a third of U.S. emissions. He said it could also lead to increases in steel supplies as big cars get recycled and fewer are produced.
He said the trend will also decrease the need to build new roads and highways, and that fewer cars and trucks on the road would cut maintenance and repair costs, as well as decrease demand for parking lots and parking garages.
"As this evolution proceeds, it will affect virtually every facet of life," Brown said.
The report was based on data from the Transportation Department's Federal Highway Administration and was compiled with the help of R.L. Polk & Co., an automotive research and consulting firm.

An officer-involved shooting which resulted in a resident being shot by police is being investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
The incident occurred in the 600 block of Swan Lake Road in Stockbridge around 1:30 am Wednesday.
Henry County police responded to a 911 call reporting gunshots and an unknown female yelling for help. Three officers were dispatched to a home, which was later found to be the wrong address.
Upon arrival at the residence, officers were met by William Powell, 63, who was armed with a handgun. Officers told Powell to drop his handgun, but he did not comply. Powell was then shot by one of the officers in the neck.
Powell was taken to Atlanta Medical Center where he is being treated for his injuries. None of the officers were injured in this incident.

The Senate GOP, of all institutions, is leading the charge against the Department of Education's rampant abuse of its authority by way of unenforceable “guidance” that it uses to threaten colleges and universities.
Two weeks ago Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee browbeat a senior Ed official into admitting that its guidance – the source of practically every change in how colleges handle sexual-assault allegations for the past several years – isn't binding because it hasn't gone through notice-and-comment procedures.
Now another subcommittee chairman, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, has extracted the same admission from an even higher-ranking Ed official.
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) notes the exchange between Lankford and Under Secretary Ted Mitchell in a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing last week.
Mitchell himself refers back to Alexander's grilling of his colleague Amy McIntosh the previous week, and Lankford replies:
The challenge that I hear over and over again from institutions of higher education is, they have a tremendous number of guidance documents that are coming to them, and they do not feel the freedom to be able to come back to Education, the Department of Ed, and say this smells a lot like a regulation to me because this is also where a stream of funding comes from. And so, they feel like they have to take it. … Now, I'm sure your answer is, they shouldn't be afraid of us; we're their friends. But I would tell you, they are very concerned that they're—not only the way the regulations are coming out, but the frequency of those regulations and the pure cumulative result of that is they're drowning in guidance documents and “Dear Colleague” letters, is actually how they are coming from you, and this sheer number of “Dear Colleague” letters they feel like they can't challenge.
Mitchell replies that he's hearing “the same things,” adding that he tells concerned institutions that “our guidance does not hold the force of law” – which must surely be a surprise to Catherine Lhamon, the head of the Office for Civil Rights, the source of the infamous 2011 “Dear Colleague” on campus sexual assault.
So do something about it, FIRE challenges Mitchell:
He should do more than just tell [colleges] that the guidance is not binding. He should use his position to ensure that all institutions know that the guidance is strictly advisory and make sure that ED stops enforcing the terms of non-binding guidance through settlement negotiations with institutions.

Ventriloquist Keith Harris who is best known for his act with puppet duck Orville has died of cancer.
The entertainer was diagnosed with the illness in 2013 and last year announced he had beaten it.
But the illness returned in January and the 67-year-old passed away this morning.
His agent Robert C Kelly paid tribute, calling him a “thoroughly decent man” as he announced his death.
He said: “I spoke to Keith most days, whether we had business to do or not. I think I laughed every single time we spoke.
“Keith was not only a technically great ventriloquist, he was also a gifted mimic and an extraordinarily funny man both on stage and off.
“Perhaps even rarer than that in showbiz, he was a thoroughly decent man, a great friend and a wonderful father and husband.”
Harris will be most remembered for his act with puppet Orville but he had a showbiz career which ran for over 50 years.
At his professional peak between 1982 and 1990, Harris had his own BBC1 Saturday night programme The Keith Harris Show. He also sold over 400,000 copies of his Orville song I wish I could fly, and he performed at private birthday parties for Prince William and Prince Harry.
Among those paying tribute were singer and broadcaster Aled Jones, who said: “Sad to hear of the death of Keith Harris - sending best wishes to his family and friends.”
Presenter Keith Chegwin tweeted: “So sad. A great entertainer and all round nice man Keith Harris has passed away. Best wishes to his family at this sad time. RIP x.”
Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said: “Very sad to hear that Keith Harris has died after a battle with cancer. Brought joy to my childhood.”
Although his popularity waned in line with the demise of variety, the entertainer never stopped working.
He developed an adult stage show featuring his ventriloquist puppets and in recent years became a panel show regular in shows such as Never Mind The Buzzcocks and reality TV such as Channel Five's The Farm.
Keith Harris, who lived near Blackpool, was married four times. His fourth wife, Sarah, is a former model and the couple have two teenage children, Kitty, 15, and Shenton, 13.
Harris also leaves behind his daughter Skye, 27, from his first marriage.
Eight Reasons Green Brands Suck, Part 1: “The List”
Valerie Salinas-Davis Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 22, 2015
According to its website, “Tesla is not just an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation.” Compare that to the brand for Nissan's EV. Did you know LEAF is an acronym for “Leading, Environmentally friendly, Affordable, Family car”? In fact, it's not an acronym, but a “backcronym” — an acronym created to fit an existing word.
In 2011, during his State of the Union address, President Obama projected we'd have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. But 2015's here and we're at fewer than 300,000 EVs. Why is that, especially after all the federal subsidies and incentives for EV owners?
Sure fossil fuel prices are cheap, but that's a relatively recent phenomenon. There's range anxiety. (“I'll get only so many miles between charges.”) Maybe there are perceptions EVs have no pep. And, some might think the cars are about as comfortable as a tin can and, well, maybe, just kind of dumb looking.
I'm picking on EVs right now because most people would probably call an EV a “green brand” — the going catch-phrase for products made with sustainability in mind. We at EnviroMedia, a sustainability communications company, have had it up to here with so-called “green” branding because most of the time it's a lazy, thoughtless, counterproductive way to describe some amazing products and companies.
So, on Earth Day 2015, we give the world, the planet, [insert another enviro-cliché here] Eight Reasons Green Brands Suck and some of the negative emotions they can elicit from perfectly good potential customers.
Eight Reasons Green Brands Suck
1. Guilt — I'm not buying that crap. I'm sticking to what I know. Go away!
2. Impracticality — I want an electric car, but I'm afraid I'll run out of charge before I get where I want to go.
3. Expensive — That green cleaner costs twice as much as the regular brands.
4. Doesn't work — That green cleaner is not only expensive, it doesn't work!
5. Ugly — Man, did you see that first-generation hybrid? Looks like something from from Planet Ork.
6. Polarizing — Why is coal calling itself “clean”?
7. Who cares? — Palm oil harvesting is ruining forests in Indonesia? Who cares? I've got bills to pay and a family to feed right here in the USA.
8. Alienating — I'll never “go green.” This product's not for me. I'm not buying it. (For those of you minding the bottom line, Reason #8 is supreme. You could be alienating half your potential customer base by saying you're green.)
There you have it. We at EnviroMedia are proclaiming that Green Brands Suck. Why? They're cliché, and they're muddying up the potential of some really progressive products. We're not saying sustainably produced products suck. We're saying placing that nebulous, oftentimes trite “green” positioning as a primary message is probably not the most advantageous way to go — most of the time.
Of course, I'm all for products and companies that innovate ways to lighten our environmental footprint. And the key word is just that — “innovate.” Not “green.” That's a color, not a car. (For the record, Innovative Brands Don't Suck. Cool Brands Don't Suck either.)
Is an electric vehicle green? Of course not. It's 4,000-ish pounds of steel, rubber, paint, plastic, and lithium. Does it produce zero carbon emissions? Yes — from the tailpipe, but plenty of carbon emissions go into producing it. Is it innovative? By all means. Plus EVs have Bluetooth, leather seats and all the other amenities of a cool car.
Coming: Part 2, Tesla Positioning, “Zero to 60, Not Zero Emissions”
Today the internet is swirling with news of how Tesla is adapting its innovations from the EV business to energy storage for homes and commercial applications. Check back next week for Part 2 of this three-part “Green Brands Suck” blog series. Part 2 illustrates how Tesla is leading the way with its refreshing positioning of vehicle performance and innovation, instead of primary messaging about reductions in tailpipe emissions.
Special thanks to my awesome colleagues Dan Driscoll and Will Lynch for helping me brainstorm the “Eight Reasons Green Brands Suck” list.
Despite the claims of Governor McCrory and North Carolina General Assembly leaders, initial salary data from the Department of Public Instruction indicate that average North Carolina teacher salaries remain below $50,000, even when accounting for local supplements. Preliminary data from the third pay period indicates that average teacher salaries – including local supplements – are approximately $49,744.
The preliminary figure of $49,744 is almost certainly a ceiling on where the final figure will land when calculated during the sixth pay period (the calculations from the sixth pay period are the figures that have historically been used for budgeting and making comparisons to other states). The average salary figure is likely to decrease by the sixth pay period for two reasons:
Teacher turno ver : Throughout the year, teachers retire, move, or get jobs in other professions. On average, these teachers tend to be replaced by less-experienced, and therefore less expensive, teachers, bringing down the average salary. Incomplete licensure data : 1,484 teachers in the third pay period have not had their licensure details finalized. These teachers' salaries are not included in the average salary data. Historically, these tend to be newer teachers with below-average salaries. Including these salaries in the average salary data will reduce the statewide average.
The tables below demonstrate how the data from DPI were used to calculate the average salary of $49,744. The first step is to calculate the weighted average base salary of teachers paid from position allotments and those paid from categorical dollar allotments. This figure is the base salary for North Carolina teachers.
To determine the total salary, additional pay components are added to the base salary. The largest of the additional pay components is the local supplement. Most school districts in North Carolina provide their teachers with additional local supplemental pay. In some districts, the local supplement is a flat dollar amount. In other districts, the local supplement is calculated as a percent increase over base pay. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the local supplement will be the same percent of base pay as in FY 15-16 (8.87%). For all other components, this analysis assumes the same dollar figure as in FY 15-16.
The debate over whether or not average teacher salaries in FY 16-17 would exceed $50,000 has been a centerpiece in statewide elections this year. NC Policy Watch has previously explained that average teacher salaries were likely to be $49,751 or below. The data today confirm the previous analysis and puts to rest claims that average teacher salaries exceed $50,000.
Danney Williams, the black man from Little Rock, Arkansas, who has claimed since the 1990s to be the illegitimate son of former President Bill Clinton, is asking Monica Lewinsky for help in proving his parentage by providing DNA from the infamous blue dress.
In an announcement Williams was scheduled to make at a news conference Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington, but released early at Radar Online, he said he wants Lewinsky to let him conduct DNA testing on the stain she testified came from a sex act she performed on Clinton at the White House on Feb. 28, 1997.
FBI documents confirmed it was a match for Bill Clinton's DNA.
Williams, an Arkansas construction worker, told Radar he believes the dress is a vital clue to his bombshell claim that he's Clinton's son by an African-American prostitute.
“I've done my homework and I saw they returned the dress to her after the tests and I thought why not ask her for it. I'm praying on it that she will make this happen for me. I'm sure [the Clintons] hurt her as they hurt me.”
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump's call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton!
See the event:
“I believe Hillary told my dad I would ruin her chances of being in the White House,” he continued in the interview. “I feel she cut him off from being in my life, but this isn't political.”
He said, “I have been told my entire life that I am President Clinton's biological son and I want my kids to know their grandfather.”
In his letter to Lewinsky, Williams said Clinton “provided cash support for me when I was a boy as well as having Arkansas State Troopers deliver Christmas presents to our home each year.”
He said his attempts to contact Bill Clinton directly went unanswered, and he was blocked when he tried through Facebook.
The issue, he told Lewinsky, “can only [be] resolved with a true, verified DNA test.”
What do YOU think? Who will win the race for the White House? Sounds off in today's WND poll
He got no response to his public request that Bill Clinton provide a DNA sample.
“Now I face the prospect of a long drawn-out paternity lawsuit in the state of Arkansas which lawyers tell me could cost a hundred (sic) of thousands of dollars and years of litigation. I am not a rich person and would have [to] try to raise the mountain of money needed to pay for the lawsuit. I am prepared to press ahead with the lawsuit if that is the only route to justice.”
But he said another way would be to access Bill Clinton's DNA from the famed dress.
“This is not about politics for me but there is solid evidence that it was Hillary who cut me [off] from my biological father. Hillary literally slammed the door in my Aunt Lucille's face when she took me to the Governor's Mansion to demand the Clinton's acknowledge me. I was not surprised to learn that Hillary called you a ‘stalker' and much, much worse. We have both been abused by Hillary Clinton. I call out to you for your help.”
Williams shed a tear while his YouTube video was playing at the news conference, and he called on Bill Clinton to “man up” and provide a sample to “help a young black boy know who he is and whose he is.”
In remarks prepared for the news conference, Williams said, “I have struggled all my life to get the acknowledgement of my father and stepmother, because like any child, I want to know my dad and I want him to know me.”
He continued: “I have always felt bad about my father not wanting to be in my life. Was it because I was black? Was there something wrong with me? It's not fair and it has been hurtful that he still refuses to acknowledge me. I am his only son in the world and he's my only dad. Recently I have been telling my kids that their grandfather was the president of the United States and they're amazed by it, they're like ‘No. Is it for real?' I tell them yes, he is my father and I will make sure you get to meet him one day.”
WND reported Oct. 19 that lawyers representing Williams, in the hours before the third and final presidential debate in Las Vegas, announced their intention to file a paternity suit demanding DNA evidence from the former president.
See the Danney Williams video feature:
WND reported last week that YouTube reversed a decision to terminate Williams' account, which features his claim.
YouTube's move blocked the nine-minute feature “BANISHED – The Untold Story of Danney Williams,” which had received more 1 million views since Williams first posted it Oct 11.
No definitive DNA test
WND reported that no DNA test was conducted in 1999, despite media reports to the contrary when Williams' claim first surfaced.
Clinton defenders since 1999 have contended the tabloid Star Magazine conducted a “DNA showdown” proving Bill Clinton was not Williams' father, citing Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton saying at the time, “There was no match, nothing even close.”
But in an interview this month, Bunton told WND that no blood sample was obtained from Clinton and Star Magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test.
“I don't remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton's DNA,” Bunton told WND.
Bunton is now the owner of the Rivertown Magazine in Haverstraw, New York.
What do YOU think? Sounds off on the FBI reopening Hillary email investigation in the WND poll
He affirmed to WND that the tabloid relied on the DNA evidence for Clinton published by independent counsel Kenneth Starr, extracted from the infamous Monica Lewinsky blue dress.
“We got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media, including the New York Times, wanting to know when we were going to get the DNA back,” Bunton recalled to WND. “We thought it was going to turn out to be his son, but when the DNA came back there was no story there even to write.”
The DNA test released by Kenneth Starr was the second of two DNA laboratories tests the FBI had run on Clinton, but the public record leaves no doubt that Starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the FBI.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A judge wonders whether Rachel Canning's case will "open the gates to a 12-year-old suing for an Xbox"
At age 41, I'm probably too young to ask what the deal is with kids today, but... What's the deal with kids today?
Last week we heard of the daughter whose Facebook bragging cost her father a hefty age-discrimination settlement. Now there's this:
According to New Jersey's Daily Record, a high school student who left home when she turned 18 is suing her parents to get them to fund her college education. Depending on whom you ask, she was either thrown out by her mum and dad or departed on her own accord because she didn't want to live by their rules anymore.
Peggy Wright reports that Rachel Canning is asking a court to order her parents to pay the balance of her private high school tuition, cover rent and living expenses and "commit an existing college fund to their daughter".
On Tuesday, a New Jersey superior court judge ruled that there was no "emergency basis" to award Rachel money immediately for her outstanding high school tuition and living expenses.
Just because you can vote, work, enlist in the armed forced and get married doesn't mean your parents are no longer obliged to care for you Mary Elizabeth Williams, Salon
In announcing his decision, Judge Peter Bogaard wondered about the precedent the case may set.
"What will the next step be?" he asked "Are we going to open the gates to a 12-year-old suing for an Xbox?"
Another hearing is set for 22 April, when lawyers will bring in supporting witnesses. In the meantime Rachel is living with a friend, whose father is bankrolling the lawsuit (reimbursement for legal fees incurred is also part of the case).
"The father contended that Rachel moved out because she didn't want to abide by simple household rules - be respectful, keep a curfew, return 'borrowed' items to her two sisters, manage a few chores, and reconsider or end her relationship with a boyfriend the parents believe is a bad influence," reports Wright.
The issue, it seems, turns on whether Rachel is "emancipated" from her parents under state law. If a court finds she isn't, then the parents may have to foot the bill. If she is, then she's on her own.
"Contrary to a popular opinion - and that private countdown clock ticking away in many parents' minds - a child is not automatically legally let loose to fend for him- or herself upon reaching an 18th birthday," writes Salon's Mary Elizabeth Williams. "Just because you can vote, work, enlist in the armed forced and get married doesn't mean your parents are no longer obliged to care for you."
If that 18-year-old is still a student, for instance, the parent-child ties may still bind.
Is this a case of a spoiled rich girl wanting something for nothing or do her parents owe her? Erin Edgemon, AL.com
Williams says that she can see both sides of the dispute:
It's hard for the many, many of us who cobbled together our educations while working thankless, crappy jobs to have a lot of sympathy for an able-bodied, intelligent girl who'd haul her parents into court to make them pay for college. But it's also got to be a humiliating and very scary blow for a high school student to have her folks stop supporting her and paying her current tuition.
The case has garnered widespread attention, as Rachel's Facebook (again - parents, take heed!) pictures, including bikini and cheerleading photos, have been spread far and wide across the Internet.
"Well, that's one way to get back at your parents," writes Matt Pearce of the Los Angeles Times.
"Is this a case of a spoiled rich girl wanting something for nothing or do her parents owe her?" asks Erin Edgemon on the Birmingham News website AL.com.
The Australia website News.com.au - yes, the story has gone global - seems to know the answer to that question, with its headline: "Spoiled teen Rachel Canning takes parents to court".
Lisa Needham of the blog Happy Nice Time People has a message for Rachel.
"Many a grown person is not allowed to live under Mommy and Daddy's roof because they are terrible adult layabouts who were overindulged as children and never grew out of it, which is pretty much how you sound," she writes.
She continues:
New Jersey courts, we beg of you, do not reward this behavior or you will have parents who are now legally stuck with their horrible adult offspring standing outside your doors with pitchforks in no time.
There's more to this case than just name-calling and parents-said, daughter-said, however. In a society where a college education is usually an essential key to a successful future, do parents have an obligation to provide this for their children?
In this case in particular, if parents have already set aside money in a college fund, does that child have a claim on it?
And finally, do we really live in the kind of society in which familial arguments can turn into acrimonious court disputes in which no one is likely to come out a winner?
Wait, I already know the answer to that one.

Barton Gellman and Greg Miller have just released yet another document from the Snowden cache: a classified breakdown of U.S. intelligence spending.
The $52.6 billion “black budget” for fiscal 2013, obtained by The Washington Post from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, maps a bureaucratic and operational landscape that has never been subject to public scrutiny. Although the government has annually released its overall level of intelligence spending since 2007, it has not divulged how it uses those funds or how it performs against the goals set by the president and Congress.
Huh. I wonder how long the Post has been holding onto this? In any case, here's the basic breakdown of the $52 billion we're spending this year:
Unsurprisingly, the CIA, NSA, and reconnaissance satellites collectively account for nearly 80 percent of our total civilian-ish intelligence spending. Another $23 billion goes to “intelligence programs that more directly support the U.S. military.” That's a total of $75 billion. Adjusted for inflation, Gellman and Miller say this exceeds our peak spending during the Cold War. Here are a few of their main takeaways:
Spending by the CIA has surged past that of every other spy agency, with $14.7 billion in requested funding for 2013. The figure vastly exceeds outside estimates and is nearly 50 percent above that of the National Security Agency, which conducts eavesdropping operations and has long been considered the behemoth of the community. Here are four of the main takeaways:
The CIA and NSA have launched aggressive new efforts to hack into foreign computer networks to steal information or sabotage enemy systems, embracing what the budget refers to as “offensive cyber operations.”
In words, deeds and dollars, intelligence agencies remain fixed on terrorism as the gravest threat to national security, which is listed first among five “mission objectives.” Counterterrorism programs employ one in four members of the intelligence workforce and account for one-third of all spending.
The governments of Iran, China and Russia are difficult to penetrate, but North Korea's may be the most opaque. There are five “critical” gaps in U.S. intelligence about Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, and analysts know virtually nothing about the intentions of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.

If you ask Marc Sophos what his favorite episode of OutCasting is, he'll have trouble picking just one.
“There are a couple,” Sophos said, OutCasting's executive producer. “In 2013 The Boy Scouts of America were considering a partial listing of their ban of gay scouts and we did a documentary. It was some of the deepest journalism that anybody did on that subject.”
That episode, number 17, was the first that came to Sophos' mind, but hardly stands alone on the list of his top picks.
“We also did a first-person account by an asexual teen, in the late summer of 2015,” Sophos said.
“We did another program, I think it was in 2014, about binational couples … the way we were using the term, binational couples referred to a same-sex couple, one member of which was a citizen of the United States, and the other was not.”
OutCasting is a nationally distributed LGBT radio program founded in 2011 by Sophos. Affiliated with The Pacifica Network, it is syndicated on over 45 public radio stations, and has since covered dozens of topics relating to everything from marriage equality to ‘debunking the “ex-gay” movement.' It has also featured prominent members of the LGBT community like Michelangelo Signorile of The Huffington Post and Olympian Greg Louganis. What is arguably most impressive however, is that until recently it was produced exclusively by New York high school students.
Sophos eventually expanded production into New York City to include college-aged contributors, but found that he wanted to grow the program even further; in terms of content production and demographics.
“We realized that we were presenting LGBTQ youth experiences and perspectives, only from the suburban New York City area, where the experience of growing up LGBTQ can be very different from how it is to grow up LGBTQ in other parts of the country,” Sophos said. “With the show now heard all over the country, we wanted the show in essence, to be sourced more nationally, from a greater number of places.”
And so, it was last February, that OutCasting officially came to Sophos' alma mater, Michigan State University. The ultimate goal being to not only teach students real-life journalistic skills, but to open up a public, accessible discourse about LGBT issues. Something that Sophos feels is too seldom discussed openly, especially by youths who might feel unable to discuss them at home.
“It's rare, and it's unfortunate that it's rare,” Sophos said. “As we all know, growing up LGBTQ and isolated can be one of the most horrible things to happen.”
Fortunately, the MSU OutCasting bureau seems far from it. It has managed to draw a steady stream of volunteers across a variety of majors in the months since its inception, and currently sits comfortably at four main contributors. One of these members is 20-year-old linguistics and Spanish major Lucy Angers.
“I joined OutCasting a couple of months ago. I was really interested in getting involved because I'm very into podcasts and public radio and that kind of thing, and I wanted to see how that worked, what goes into that and learn some new skills,” Angers said. “I'm also interested in queer issues and learning about that as well. I like meeting new people and gaining new skills.”
Though production began last fall, both LGBT MSU students and allies are encouraged to join.
Sophos stressed that options to contribute exist for even those individuals who are wary about revealing their sexual orientation on air through the use of pseudonyms, allowing members to produce content off-air and more.
Episodes of OutCasting airing locally can be found through The Pacifica Network's weekly,
decentralized radio program “Sprouts: Radio from the Grassroots.” OutCasting produces anywhere from six to eight episodes annually, but seeks to become a monthly program.
“Which is one of the other reasons that we want to have these other bureaus, because we need to increase the number of programs we do so that we can expand beyond Pacifica into NPR type stations,” Sophos said. “What I hope eventually will happen, is that the MSU bureau will thrive to such a degree that you can start bringing area high school students.”
When You're Not Saving The World In Bravely Second, You Can Make Plushies
By Sato . March 20, 2015 . 2:02am
In addition to all the new jobs we'll see in Bravely Second, the game introduces a new system called the CapCap Maker, a unique plush-making mini-game. This week's issue of Jump magazine tells us a little more.
The CapCap Maker is a new system that will let you make plushes in a mini-game during your adventures in Bravely Second.
While we still don't know everything about it, you can make CapCap dolls that resemble monsters. Additionally, you can sell these for currency called “Cap,” which are then used to purchase BGM tracks of different kinds. The screenshot shows them buying a “Main Theme” track.
Bravely Second is slated for release in Japan on April 23, 2015 for Nintendo 3DS.
Sony Traditional TV has absolutely nothing to fear from Netflix or YouTube — at least that's the stance of Alan Wurtzel, NBC's head of research.
On a press tour for the Television Critic's Association, Wurtzel said the reports of TV's death had been greatly exaggerated, according to AdWeek.
In particular, Wurtzel took the time to argue against the idea that Netflix had a real effect on viewing patterns.
In a keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) last week, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings spoke glowingly of the binge-watching era, and how Netflix was fundamentally changing the way we consume shows.
Wurtzel's position is that this simply isn't true. He cited data from analytics company Symphony Advanced Media, which says that Netflix users actually return to their former viewing habits in a few weeks, and that original shows from Netflix don't make much of an impact.
Wurtzel cited "Orange is the New Black," which he claimed drew 23% of all viewers in its first week, but dropped to 3% by its fifth.
"Everyone goes back to watching TV like God intended," Wurtzel said. He meant linearly, or traditionally, according to AdWeek.
YouTube
Wurtzel also called YouTube's threat to TV a "sidebar," and said the amount of time people spend on YouTube is "ridiculously small." He cited statistics that adults 18 to 24 years old spend 62 hours watching TV and only 12 hours watching YouTube.
He made no mention of the fact that people aged 13 to 24 not only spend more time watching free online video than they do watching TV, but also find it more entertaining and relevant to their lives.
Netflix declined to comment.

A video has surfaced that protesters say show Congressman Neal Dunn, R-Panama City, ran a red light Thursday to avoid talking to them about health care.
About 60 constituents had gathered outside of Dunn's Tallahassee office seeking a meeting. Dunn declined an opportunity to talk to the group and instead left the office through an underground garage. Michael Nair-Collins, a professor at the Florida State University College of Medicine, and others ran to the garage to catch Dunn. They told the Democrat he left with an aide in the Chevy Tahoe caught on video.
Dunn's office and the congressman failed to respond to a question of whether the car in the video Nair-Collins shot is the one Dunn used Thursday.

Let's hear it for Vox for coming through with the hot Memorial Day take nobody needed:
Nothing is sacred. Not even on Memorial Day:
There's a “toxic masculinity culture” in the Marine Corps, James Joyner, a professor at the Marine Command and Staff College, told me. That may be what is at the core of the women-in-infantry debate among Marine ranks: the identity crisis of a historically macho club now being forced to let in women. Now that the Marine Corps must allow women to serve in combat roles — and is putting out recruiting commercials highlighting that fact — it tears at the social fabric of the service. That has led many to act out, some anonymously, online.
And what, pray tell, has led Vox to think this drivel was worth publishing?
@voxdotcom @AlexWardVox Alex, it's Memorial Day. You chose this day to publish a hit piece on the Marines. Be ashamed, if that's possible for you. — Kron (@Kronykal) May 29, 2017

Quantifying the Quality of SMTP TLS Support
This study analyzes, how much mail server offer a TLS upgrade and examines the quality of the STARTTLS implementation or setup. It checks the quality of protocol version and ciphers, but also determines how widespread are some setup or implementation errors I've seen in practice. To make the results somewhat more relevant it uses the top 1 million domains based on the studies by Alexa. It also provides the necessary tools to do such study with your own domain list.
Some background to mail delivery
Mail is transferred from sender to recipient with multiple hops. The initial hop is usually from senders MUA (Mail User Agent) to the MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) of the senders domain using the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) protocol. Then there is at least on hop from there to the MTA of the recipients domain, but in more complex setups like in companies there can be multiple hops or there can be some middleboxes like firewalls in-between.
While the MTA for the sender is usually configured within the senders MUA, the MTA for the recipients domain is determined by looking at the MX (Mail Exchange) records in the DNS (Domain Name System). Per definition the recipients MTA is contacted by plain, unencrypted SMTP on port 25. Only after issuing a STARTTLS command the connection can be upgraded to TLS.
What this study is not about
This study does not check if the recipients MTA provides a valid certificate, which matches the recipients domain and is signed by a trusted certificate agency. Such certificates are needed with do detect active man-in-the-middle attacks. Unfortunatly, due to the overall design of the STARTTLS process an active attacker can just simply strip the STARTTLS support from the communication instead of mounting the much harder man-in-the-middle attack against TLS. Thus STARTTLS like currently used is only able to protect the connection against passive sniffing and not active attacks.
What happens if the initial TLS upgrade fails?
Contrary to most desktop browsers MTA will usually not retry with a downgraded TLS protocol or without TLS later, but will simply retry the same way again at some later time. Thus the delivery will fail again and usually after some days the mail is finally considered undeliverable. Unfortunatly, all one will get as feedback is usually a "TLS handshake failed" message which most system administrators will either ignore or will need to explicitly add an delivery exception for this specific domain.
Summary of results
From the domains checked about 84% provide a mail server and from these about 72% provide support for STARTTLS, i.e. about 60% of all domains.
Nearly all STARTTLS enabled servers are configured in a sane way, that is 68% offer TLS1.2 and 32% TLS1.0. Only very few servers still need SSL3.0. Interestingly, TLS1.2 is less in use amomg the top sites, i.e only 59% of the top 5k sites offer TLS1.2 while it is 68% among the top 1M sites.
The offered ciphered are mostly fine. More than 80% of the servers uses ciphers with Forward Secrecy by default, either with DHE or ECDHE ciphers. The use of the faster ECDHE is more prominent among the top servers, even if TLS1.2 is less common at these top sites.
A surprisingly large number especially of the top sites has problems with MD5 client certificates, see below. Other problems I've seen in practice (see below) are not that widespread.
Problems seen in practice
Even if the large majority of the mail servers are not broken, there are still enough servers out there which cause real problems. Only about 30% of the servers I had problem reports for were even in the top 1M list and even then at the lower end of the list, where the most problems (apart from MD5 client certificates) can be seen.
Croaks on client certificate signed with MD5
Lots of sites (9% of the top 5k, 4% of all) simply close the connection if the client provides an client certificate signed with MD5 within a TLS1.2 connection. This problem does not happen if the certificate is signed with SHA-1 or others signature algorithms, or if a TLS protocol lower than TLS1.2 is used. Interestingly it also works if the client does not provide a certificate at all, because the server only requests but not requires client certificates. And while MD5 signatures should not be used any more it is not uncommon that they are just kept if older systems get upgraded.
This problem shows up with sites where *.mail.protection.outlook.com is configured as MX. It can also be seen with other sites and often a hint to some "AntiSpamProxy" can be seen inside the servers certificate. Because of the strange symptoms the underlying cause of delivery errors is hard to find unless one specifically looks out for this problem.
Only TLS1.2 ciphers
Due to a misunderstanding of the POODLE attack some sites disabled all SSL3.0 ciphers instead of only disabling the SSL3.0 protocol version. Since SSL3.0 ciphers are also needed for TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 and only TLS1.2 defines some new ciphers, this effectivly makes this server TLS1.2 only and thus inaccesible for about 30..40% of the mail server which can do only TLS1.0. While not very common this error is much more prominent among the less used sites.
TLS1.1+ required
Some sites only allow TLS1.1+ for some yet unknown reason. One reason is the disabling of SSL3.0 ciphers as described in the previous issue, but there seem to be other causes too. The impact is about the same as with the previous problems, that is it makes the server inaccessible for 30..40% of the MTAs's worldwide.

Image caption The Kosovo intervention in 1999 was justified by humanitarian concerns
The words "international law" convey the sense of a set of established international rules and authorities agreed by all nations, and easily understood and applied by them.
Sadly that is far from the case, and in practice, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get definitive rulings in international law involving military intervention. There is no international court on hand to give the legal go-ahead to intervene.
However, there is a developing legal framework for military intervention on humanitarian grounds.
Known as the Responsibility to Protect, or R2P, it was born out of the humanitarian disasters of the 1990s in Kosovo and Rwanda.
It is widely but not universally accepted and has three principal elements:
States must protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, while, simultaneously, the international community has an obligation to help states prevent such crimes
Where there is strong evidence of these crimes and a state cannot or will not stop them, the international community should exhaust all peaceful means in seeking to bring the atrocity to an end
If all that is done, and fails, the international community can use military force
In order to have maximum legitimacy, military intervention should be authorised by the UN Security Council. It holds a unique position as the primary arbiter on the use of force in international law.
However, as in the case of Syria, it may be hamstrung by a lack of consensus, with one or more members opposed to action.
'Coalition of the willing'
In these situations, according to one view, R2P provides a legal framework for the international community to use military force as a last resort - either by way of a regional coalition or a so-called "coalition of the willing".
There are a number of safeguards in R2P:
There needs to be powerful evidence of an ongoing atrocity
Peaceful measures, such as diplomacy and sanctions, must have been exhausted
Any force used must be specifically targeted at stopping the atrocity and protecting the civilian population
In other words, it is a limited power to act. However, if all of the criteria are met, then the limited and targeted use of military force would be legal in international law under R2P, some lawyers and commentators believe.
Ultimately though, military interventions in these circumstances are up to governments rather than lawyers.
It is for them to make the case for military intervention by showing that the legal requirements have been met.
In the case of Syria, they will argue that there is an ongoing atrocity, all peaceful means of stopping it have been exhausted, and that targeted military action could achieve the twin goals of ending the atrocity and protecting the civilian population.
This book is a rather interesting guide to the "proper" manner of wearing the Scottish dress - it's actually quite an amusing little book.
Thompson isn't actually Scottish, which is kind of fitting given that I'm guessing neither are the majority of his audience. I'm not trying to be condescending, but this really is meant for those of us in the Scottish diaspora where few Highland Balls or Ceilidhs are complete without some disagreements on which side the clan brooch is worn or which side a lady
This book is a rather interesting guide to the "proper" manner of wearing the Scottish dress - it's actually quite an amusing little book.
Thompson isn't actually Scottish, which is kind of fitting given that I'm guessing neither are the majority of his audience. I'm not trying to be condescending, but this really is meant for those of us in the Scottish diaspora where few Highland Balls or Ceilidhs are complete without some disagreements on which side the clan brooch is worn or which side a lady chief walks on.
As a Pipe Sergeant who functions in a band without a Drum Major and plays at weddings where groomsmen have hired the Scottish dress having never worn it before, I spend a lot of time adjusting highland dress and I see a lot of people getting it "wrong" as there are a lot of bits, pieces, strings and buckles - so it is lovely to have a convenient guide to help people wear it "right" - or at least "right-ish" (as I would argue there's some flexibility.)
I read this a little while back and what actually surprises me is the relative young age of the book - some of the language is a little older-fashioned (to the point where I actually quoted parts of it in my local Caledonian society's newsletter!) Just the title alone made me laugh so much I knew I had to own a copy!
I especially giggled at the part about women wearing the kilt - where Thompson voices his objections as "this is not a matter of sexism, but of anatomy. The sett of the tartan does not fit the female form well!" I also cheered when he took on people who wear "all manner of tartan and shiny tatt" - and he actually shows how to get into a Great Kilt (which I wish more people would research before giving it a go.)
Oh, and in case you're wondering, my answer is always "My shoes and socks." Then I wink.
It started with a knock on the door. Someone from the hotel, thought Peter Greste, and he went to let them in. But bellboys these were not.
“I remember cracking the door open, and then… [Greste slaps his hands together] these guys just came storming in. They said ‘are you Peter Greste?' I said: ‘Yes'. And they said: ‘Right, stand there'. And they just started going through all my stuff.”
So began the detention of Peter Greste, the Australian journalist arrested from his Cairo hotel room in late December 2013, charged with trumped-up allegations of terrorism and inventing the news, and jailed for seven years last June.
This week, for the first time, Greste has been able to tell parts of his story, in interviews with the Guardian in Singapore and Brisbane.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Greste and his family at the Brisbane press conference
On Sunday, he was deported to Australia, and when he finally arrived home in the small hours of Thursday morning, he was given the final confirmation of his freedom. “Mr Greste,” said one of the two uniformed police officers waiting at the door of his aircraft. “Welcome to Australia.”
It was an apt bookend to his ordeal, which began with almost the inverse experience: plainclothes detectives forcing their way into his room one night in December 2013, and refusing to answer his questions. “I said: ‘What is going on? Who are you? Where's your warrant?'” says Greste, wearing the same wide-brimmed hat he was arrested in. “They didn't respond to me, they didn't say anything. I didn't know what to think.”
Over a year later, Greste still has far more questions than answers about what happened to him. Why exactly was he arrested? Why was he released? And how was he – an award-winning ex-BBC correspondent – ever convicted? These are grey areas on which Greste is not yet prepared to speculate, particularly while two of his colleagues at al-Jazeera English (AJE), Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy, remain in jail, and in danger.
At the time, the trio's arrest sent shockwaves through the Cairo press corps, some of whom wondered if it was the opening salvo of a crackdown on foreign journalists. As the weeks drew on, the growing consensus was that AJE was targeted because of support among other parts of the al-Jazeera network for Egypt's Islamist opposition.
Exhausted after a four-day journey home, and uncertain of what he should and should not say about a case that is still live, Greste has no conclusive take on the debate. What he does know is that, at the time of his arrest, Egypt was a place he barely knew.
Usually AJE's Kenya correspondent, he had been in Cairo for just a few days, as Christmas-cover for a colleague.
“It was just routine cover. It was just treading water.” Greste hadn't been to Egypt before, and he didn't follow Egyptian politics in any detail. “All I was planning on doing was sitting around doing routine stories. As you know, when you're in a new place, you don't test the limits until you're familiar with where those limits are. You stick very much to safe ground, and that's what we were doing.”

So when the police came knocking that night in December 2013, Greste thought it was all some mistake. “OK, something had happened, someone had said something. Whatever. But I wasn't too concerned. I was frustrated. I was pissed off. But I didn't think it was going to be anything particularly serious.”
But serious is an understatement for what followed. Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed were accused of aiding Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood, and of falsifying news reports in order to undermine Egyptian national security. In Egypt, they were nicknamed “the Marriott cell”, after the hotel at which he was arrested. Outside the country, the three became the focus of a global rights campaign.
Greste saw first-hand the flaws of the Egyptian judicial system. In his own trial, prosecutors inexplicably presented as evidence of his guilt a Gotye song, footage of trotting horses, photos of his parents, an interview he filmed with Kenyan politicians, and Arabic text messages, which he cannot read.
“The inefficiencies are just unbelievable,” Greste told reporters during one chaotic court session, in one of the many shouted conversations he had with journalists from his cage in the courtroom, over the heads of a line of police officers. “That whole cellphone that the prosecution says is mine is not mine. It's all in Arabic. I don't speak Arabic.”
But the worst part of the case was naturally the announcement of the guilty verdict itself. “It just felt like being punched, being king-hit [an Australian term for a decisive blow],” said Greste. “We were always confident that we were innocent, and to see the judge disagree with that, and sentence us to seven years, was very confronting.” The crammed court descended into pandemonium the moment the verdict was announced. Greste, who had to have the proceedings translated, took a moment to realise what had just occurred. But when he did, he was so shocked that he cannot remember what exactly happened next.
“All I remember was a bit of blur after that – it was such an emotional moment. But you pull yourself together, you have to deal with it – and one of the things that I've learnt is that when you're forced into these difficult environments, you discover things about yourself, and discover that you're better able to cope than you previously imagined.”

That Greste has been released seven months after he was found guilty is down to a presidential decree that appears to have been written with his case in mind, and which allows foreign convicts to be deported to their home countries. But as with much of the case, Greste is mystified by why exactly he was released when he was, and in the manner he was.
In fact, his release was an anti-climax. “After 400 days in prison, you want the crowd to go ‘hurray, woo,' you want the cameras there, you want people to high-five, you want hugs,” Greste says. Instead, when he was driven from the prison to the airport on Sunday, “I didn't see anyone, there was no drama, no ceremony, there was nothing. It was just incredibly banal.”
At the airport, his police escort shook him by the hand, wished him luck, and then “got back in the car, and disappeared with his mates. And that was it”.
After 400 days, “I was left standing there outside the airport, thinking: ‘Hmm.'”
The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution today granting non-member observer status to Palestine. The UN now classifies Palestine in the same manner as the Vatican, a delegation diplomatically known as the Holy See that cannot vote.
The resolution–with 138 countries in favor, nine opposed, and 41 abstentions–came on the 65th anniversary of the Partition Plan, the landmark resolution that defined the sovereign boundaries for a new “Arab state” and a new “Jewish state” in the former British Mandate of Palestine. The resolution resulted in what Israel calls its War of Independence, and what Palestinians refer to as the Nakba or “catastrophe.”
Only four countries in today's nine-member opposition also voted on the Partition Plan: the US, Panama, Canada, and the Czech Republic (as part of Czechoslovakia in 1947). All of them were in favor of the 1947 motion.
Twenty-two of the 56 countries that voted on both resolutions were in favor of both the Partition Plan and today's resolution, including Russia (as the USSR), France, Australia, and Venezuela. Thirteen who were in favor of the recent motion for Palestine were opposed in 1947. The only countries outside the Middle East to have this change of heart were Cuba, Greece, and India.
The United Kingdom as well as Colombia have abstained on both votes.
No member of South America has been opposed to either measure. However, its closest neighbor, Panama, was against the most recent resolution.
The nations spawned from the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s voted nearly unanimously in abstention. Only Serbia broke with the bloc, voting in favor of recognition.
Every Middle East nation voted against the Partition Plan in 1947, which defined Israel as a sliver of land unrecognizable to today's shape. Today, each of them voted for Palestine's recognition, in a resolution that also recognized Israel's current borders including land annexed before 1967.
Correction (Nov. 30): An earlier version this graphic in this story incorrectly indicated Australia voted in favor of Palestinian recognition on Thursday. The country abstained.
The Bank of Russia has approved the decision to set up an Association for Financial Technologies Development (FinTech Association).
Nations across the globe are starting to become more aware of the blockchain movement. It's a trend that has affected world leaders, academics, banks, and IT firms all looking for ways to capitalize on the potential of the technology in many sectors – especially in FinTech. The US, Korea, Japan, and Russia are all seeing more research and developments in the blockchain industry.
On December 28, 2016, the Bank of Russia approved the decision to establish an association for Financial Technology Development (Fintech Association). The association will consist of a governing body that includes founding members such as Alfa Bank, VTB Bank, JSC National System of Payment Cards, along with a supervisory board and chief executive officer.
The association's objective is to study, research, and implement practical solutions within the FinTech sector by utilizing distributed ledger technology (DLT), open application program interfaces (open API), and remote identification.
Olga Skorobogatoua, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Russia stated:
"The main objectives of the Association will be the development and implementation of new technological solutions to ensure the development of the Russian financial market, as well as the creation of conditions for the digitization of the economy of the Russian Federation."
Currently, the association is entering the final stage of the state registration process and operations are expected to begin in January 2017.
How does this effect Ethereum?
In October 2016, the Bank of Russia and its largest banks ran a test Ethereum-based prototype for financial messaging called “Masterchain.” The platform provides secure confirmation of customer transactional data, provides banking affiliates with state-of-the-art products and services, and speeds up transaction confirmation times. The adoption of an Ethereum-based, country-wide solution could turn heads in the FinTech industry and assist Ethereum with securing a foothold in Russia and other countries.
Pro-life advocates in Tennessee are working hard to promote Amendment 1, which would mitigate the far-reaching effects of state court decisions preventing the passage of virtually any pro-life law to stop or limit abortions.
Seeking to demonize those pro-life people and rally abortion backers to oppose Amendment 1, a political group calling itself “Tennesseans for Preservation of Personal Privacy, Inc.” paid for large ads to be placed in papers across the state on Sunday. Each ad refers to pro-life Amendment 1 as the “Tennessee Taliban Amendment” and urges voters to vote NO.
Brian Harris of Tennessee Right to Life alerted LifeNews to the ads.
“Among misrepresentations are wrong claims that Amendment 1 will somehow “control” birth control and in vitro fertilization,” he said. “In fact, Amendment 1 is brought in response to a radical decision by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 2000 which established a so-called “fundamental right to abortion” in the Tennessee Constitution.”
Harris explained that Amendment 1 does not enact any particular policy but rather, neutralizes the Court's 2000 decision and restores to the people the ability to again deliberate and decide what Tennessee's laws should be on the life and death matter of abortion.
The amendment states, in part, “the people retain the right…to enact, amend or repeal statutes regarding abortion…”
CLICK LIKE IF YOU'RE PRO-LIFE!
“It is unfortunate that pro-abortion opponents of Amendment 1 have chosen to open their campaign in such an offensive manner,” said Jennifer Hicks, spokeswoman for Yes on 1. “Taliban rule relates to rape, slavery, murder, and brutal degradation of women, not to social policy debates in the state of Tennessee. Those placing the ad should apologize to Tennesseans but especially to those refugees in our state who have been the victims of such cruel regimes.”
WASHINGTON – The oldest surviving mosque in America celebrated its 110th anniversary this week, reflecting a deep-rooted Muslim community that blossomed centuries ago in the American continent.
Here are four historic American mosques that reveal the story of American Muslims:
* THE BROOKLYN MOSLEM MOSQUE, NEW YORK CITY
America's oldest surviving mosque sits on a quiet road in Washington Heights, Brooklyn, New York City. The two-storey late-19th-century building is covered in vertical, white wooden slats.
The mosque society was founded in 1907 by white Muslims from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Poland, and Belarus. The community of ethnic Tatars came together to purchase the former church in 1927 before making it look like the mosques they had left behind in the Baltic: small wooden buildings with ornate little turrets on the top.
“This mosque was such an important place for the migrating Tatars when they came to New York. It was like a touchstone and a place they knew they could come to, where familiar faces would help them get on their feet,” Alyssa Ratkewitch, the mosque's Vice President, told My Salaam on Tuesday, October 24.
* NORTH DAKOTA MOSQUE, ROSS, NORTH DAKOTA
The North Dakota mosque is located in a remote spot in the northwestern corner of the state close to the Canadian border. The nearest town has a population of around 50 people.
The mosque was rebuilt in 2005 as a monument to the original Lebanese and Syrian community that erected a mosque here in 1929. The modern structure is a simple, square brick building with four thin faux minarets and a small central copper dome. It looks nothing like the original mosque, which was torn down in 1979.
* MOTHER MOSQUE, CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA
Known as America's Mother Mosque, this is another monument to early American Muslims who migrated from Greater Syria. Built in 1934, the mosque has been known as the Rose of Fraternity Lodge and the Moslem Temple.
Today, the local community worships at the nearby Islamic Center of Cedar Rapids, built in 1971 to serve the growing community. The Mother Mosque is primarily used for heritage education, hosting visits from schools and dignitaries across the US.
* MASJID MUHAMMAD, WASHINGTON DC
The first mosque to be built in the capital by descendants of enslaved African Americans and African Muslims, the Masjid Muhammad's origins date back to the 1930s. The current building, which started life as a Nation of Islam (NOI) temple, opened in 1960 through the support of key fundraiser and global Muslim icon Malcolm X.
In 1975, Masjid Muhammad embraced mainstream Sunni Islam under the guidance of the late Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, one of the sons of early NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, who opened the mosque as “Temple 4”.
Imam Mohammed appointed a Sunni imam and changed the temple's name to the “Washington Masjid”. He removed the pews from the main hall so conventional salah could take place and also changed the direction of prayer to the correct qibla orientation.

Hillary Clinton remained largely quiet the week of the Republican National Convention, emerging to announce her vice presidential pick the day after it ended.
Donald Trump is choosing a different route.
Trump announced Monday — the day the Democratic National Convention is starting in Philadelphia — that he will host a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” on Wednesday night at 7 p.m. That's the night President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are slated to speak.
Reddit is a site that calls itself the “front page of the internet.” It constantly updates the latest images, stories and breaking news from the internet and its audience is primarily young people, especially millennials.

Many politicians have hosted AMAs before, including Obama.
During primary season, Reddit users were known for frequent posts supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has since endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Trump has made it clear in the past that he is targeting Sanders' supporters, some of whom have pledged to not vote for Clinton.
Those voters may be feeling even more spurned now, as emails leaked over the weekend revealed leaders in the Democratic National Committee favored Clinton's candidacy over Sanders' from the start. Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation following the leak.
Ma Kushmanda is worshipped by devotees on the fourth day of Navratri. This avatar of Adi Shakti is also referred to as the Smiling Goddess. Her name is made up of three distinct words. The first word is “Ku” which means little. The second word is “Ushma” which means warmth or energy. And the third word is “Anda” which means egg.
Upon combining the three words, one can derive the meaning of her name which means the one who is the creator of this “little cosmic egg” called Universe. As mentioned above, this form is a happy manifestation of the goddess.
There is an interesting story about Ma Kushmanda. It is said that when the universe was non-existent and there was darkness everywhere, Ma Kushmanda produced this “little cosmic egg” with her smile. The universe was then filled with light. It is believed that she is the source of all the energy in the universe. Further, it is also believed that she lives in the core of the Sun and thus provides energy to all the beings. She is believed to provide direction to Surya, the Sun God.
After creating the Universe, Ma Kushmanda created the first beings. These were three supreme goddesses. With her left eye, she created a terrorizing form and named her Mahakali. From her center eye (on her forehead), she created another ferocious form and named her Mahalakshmi. From her right eye, came an extremely benevolent and smiling form, which she named Mahasaraswati.
From the body of Mahakali, a male and a female took birth. The male had five heads and ten arms. He was named as Shiva. The female had one head and four arms. Her name was kept Saraswati.
From Mahalakshmi's body also a male and a female took birth. The male had four heads and four arms. Ma Kushmanda named him as Brahma whereas the female was named as Lakshmi. She had one head and four arms.
When Ma Kushmanda glanced at Mahasaraswati, she also gave birth to a male and a female. The male had one head and four arms. He was named Vishnu. The female had one head and four arms and was named Shakti.
She then offered Shakti to Shiva, Saraswati to Brahma and Lakshmi to Vishnu as consorts.
Thereafter, Ma Kushmanda absorbed the three supreme goddesses and herself entered Shakti as an orb of divine and unending energy.
It is thus believed that Ma Kushmanda is a form of Shakti who created this Universe and was the first being in the entire Universe. The gods that she created then went on to create other living beings in the Universe.
Ma Kushmanda possesses eight arms. She wields a Kamandalu, a bow, an arrow, a lotus, a pot of nectar, a disc, a mace and a rosary in her eight arms. She rides a lion which evokes fearlessness in her devotees. She bestows all pleasure and her regular worship brings prosperity, powers, pleasures and salvation. She destroys all ailments, troubles and hurdles of her true devotees.
We're proud to announce support for 1.5.1 in the Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes. This is a pure upstream distribution of Kubernetes, designed to be easily deployable to public clouds, on-premise, bare metal, and developer laptops. Kubernetes 1.5.1 includes a ton of new features and bugfixes, and we encourage you to check out the release notes.
Getting Started:
Here's the simplest way to get a Kubernetes 1.5.1 cluster up and running on an Ubuntu 16.04 system:
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:juju/stable sudo apt-add-repository ppa:conjure-up/next sudo apt update sudo apt install conjure-up conjure-up kubernetes
During the installation conjure-up will ask you what cloud you want to deploy on and prompt you for the proper credentials. If you're deploying to local containers (LXD) see these instructions for localhost-specific considerations.
For production grade deployments and cluster lifecycle management it is recommended to read the full Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes documentation.
Home page: https://jujucharms.com/canonical-kubernetes/
Source code: https://github.com/juju-solutions/bundle-canonical-kubernetes
New features
Full support for Kubernetes v1.5.1.
The charms now support the Container Network Interface (CNI).
The changes to the flannel integration are incompatible with the old method, as a result you must redeploy your cluster to get the latest release.
Flannel is now CNI only. The SDN plugin interface has been removed.
CNI support will allow us to support other CNI based Software Defined Network (SDN) applications, such as Calico and Weave.
In order to provide a more pure upstream Kubernetes experience, and support the wide range of amazing integration work being done by the community, the Elastic Stack is no longer included by default. Deploying and integrating with the Elastic Stack is still supported and is provided as a post deployment option.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Monday the United States does not intend to seize oil from Iraq, something President Donald Trump has in the past advocated as "spoils" for U.S military activity there and to prevent the Islamic State group from selling it.
Mattis spoke to reporters traveling with him to Iraq for an unannounced visit, which came on the second day of a military offensive to push Islamic State from the western part of the city of Mosul.
"I think all of us here in this room, all of us in America, have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I'm sure that we will continue to do that in the future," Mattis said. "We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil."
Later in Baghdad, Mattis also vowed to support Iraq through the fight against the Islamic State group.
"I assure you we are going to stand by you through this fight. We will stand by you and your army in the future so that your sovereignty is protected by the Iraqi forces and no one else," he said.
WATCH: Mattis on Iraqi oil
When asked if the United States would stay in Iraq after the battle for Mosul had ended, he said, "I imagine we'll be in this fight for a while and we'll stand by each other."
Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the U.S.-led coalition working to defeat Islamic State, was more explicit. "I don't anticipate that we'll be asked to leave by the government of Iraq immediately after Mosul. I think the government of Iraq realizes this is a very complex fight and they're going to need the assistance of the coalition even beyond Mosul."
On Monday, Iraqi forces advanced into the southern outskirts of Mosul on the second day of a push to drive Islamic State militants from the city's western part. Forces targeted a hill that overlooks the city's airport, entering the village of Abu Saif.
Mattis' stop in Iraq includes meetings with Townsend, as well as with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other Iraqi officials. Mattis is working on his own plan to accelerate the fight against Islamic State, which Trump ordered on January 28 be delivered to him within 30 days.
As the Mosul offensive began Sunday, Mattis said the U.S. role, which has been to conduct airstrikes and serve as advisers to Iraqi troops, will remain the same.
"The attack into the city is something I don't want to go into details about because I owe confidentiality to the troops who are actually making the attack. At the same time, we are very close to it if not already engaged in that, in that fight," he said. "The U.S. forces continue in the same role that they were in East Mosul and the coalition forces are in support of this operation, and we will continue as you know with the accelerated effort to destroy ISIS."
Iraqi troops pushed Islamic State out of the eastern part of Mosul last month after a campaign that lasted more than 100 days. U.S. military officials have warned the fight for the western part of the city will likely be much tougher.
Iraqi special operations forces, regular army and federal police units are taking part in the offensive along with government-approved paramilitary forces.
The United Nations warned Sunday that hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk in Mosul.
"The situation is distressing. People, right now, are in trouble,'' Lise Grande, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said in a statement. "We are hearing reports of parents struggling to feed their children and to heat their homes."
This is the new law that the US government is getting ready to pass- Drug Trafficking Safe Harbor Elimination Act of 2010.
Did you know next time as a US citizen you go to Amsterdam and get high and are caught that the US government can punish you upon your return to the US?
Animalnewyork.com A little talked about bill that could have major consequences for Americans who travel abroad made its way to the House floor on Wednesday and is expected to pass. It's called the Drug Trafficking Safe Harbor Elimination Act of 2010‘ and it's quite possibly one of the most invasive pieces of legislation ever introduced. What's so bad about it? It basically says that U.S. laws apply to U.S. citizens no matter where in the world they are, except in countries where it's legal to use drugs, which is just about nowhere.
Is this making you think twice about cleaning that crack pipe ahead of your trip to Tijuana kids?
Keep in mind that even in places like Holland, cannabis isn't legal, it's tolerated, so technically speaking, a U.S. citizen partaking in Amsterdam's local “coffee shop” culture could be persecuted for “smoking a doob.”
So as much as you think there is more tolerance to drug use, or a move towards it, whether you personally think tolerance should be heeded, it seems the bigger issue at hand is the heavy weight of the law which going forward will be keeping tabs on your goings on no matter where you are in the world.
The fact that it is done under the guise of drug laws is just a neat trick to convince you that this law should stay. So whether you like to get high or not, the bigger question, are you in the mood to have every action on your part scrutinized for the sake of national security and hegemony? Maybe a puff on the good shit will help you come up with an answer, assuming you are brave enough to do so…

Who needs mailmen when you've got drones? That's what France thinks, anyway.
The French postal service is beginning an experimental drone delivery program to deliver parcels on a nine mile route once a week. After the program gets approval from the French aviation regulatory authority, the federal postal service will be the first to ever use drone delivery on a regular route.
The drones used in the French postal service experiment have the capacity to fly up to 12 miles carrying about two pounds maximum, going around 19 miles per hour. They are also equipped with parachutes for safe emergency landing in case something disrupts the flight. The eventual goal is to reach rural or mountainous regions that are otherwise difficult and expensive to get to using cars.
The drone mail delivery program has been a project of the DPDgroup, Europe's second largest international parcel delivery network, operating as a subsidiary under the French national postal service. The DPDgroup had been working on this program with Atechsys, a French drone company, since 2014 in the south of France.
"The first commercial line represents a new step in the program," DPDgroup said in a press release. With the testing phase now over, the experimentation phase is all set to begin.
Currently, those participating in the experiment to receive parcels are non-residential, including over ten tech companies. The done routes stretch over the southeastern region of Provence, going between Saint-Maximin-La-Sainte-Beaume and Pourrieres.
Still, while France may be the first to use drones in federal postage, it's not the only one using drones for mail. Amazon's drone delivery service made its first delivery last week in the United Kingdom. And in America, the U.S. Postal service took a survey to determine how people would feel about drones delivering packages to their homes. It turned out that more people were into the idea than against it.

You wouldn't know it by watching CNN or MSNBC, but there is a competitive primary taking shape in the Democratic Party as Bernie Sanders is making big gains on Hillary Clinton in Nevada.
The Clinton campaign strategy views the combination of South Carolina and Nevada as a potential Bernie Sanders momentum buster. They have worked hard to build a good organization and learn from their mistakes of 2008, but the well funded Sanders campaign is making a real push to organize the state.
Politico reported on a few of the reasons why Sanders could be in a position to pull an upset:
There are several factors suggesting an opening for Sanders to mount a strong challenge to the Democratic front-runner — if he plays his ground game right.
The powerful Culinary Union that represents 60,000 members, multiple sources said, is expected to remain neutral and offer no endorsement until after the caucuses. In 2008, the union backed Obama about three weeks before the caucuses.
Same-day registration for Democrats here also means more nontraditional voters can participate in the process if Sanders campaign manages to turn them out on caucus day. To that effect, National Nurses United launched a “Bernie Bus” on Wednesday, making multiple stops in Las Vegas to rally supporters ahead of the Democratic dinner. The bus made stops in front of the Tropicana Las Vegas and the MGM Grand Conference Center to turn out Nevada registered nurses for Sanders.
As PoliticusUSA reported on December 23, 2015, the Sanders camp views Nevada as the state that could break open the Democratic race for them. Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine said, “Bernie intends to run a full-fledged national campaign beginning in Iowa and New Hampshire and extending into later states across the nation. The campaign's movement into Nevada with statewide television advertising is a demonstration of Bernie's potential and strength with voters and our belief that his story and message of American's rigged economy held in place by a corrupt system of campaign finance will resonate powerfully across the nation.”
The endorsement of former Clinton supporter and Nevada DNC member Erin Bilbray was big for Sanders. At the time of her endorsement, Bilbray said, “I have spent my entire career working to engage women in the political process,” Bilbray said. “But at this point, the biggest threat to American democracy is the dark money from super PACs that are controlling our elections. Government cannot focus on all of the important issues that affect America's working families when a handful of super wealthy donors, in both parties, have the ability to predetermine who will win the election. Senator Bernie Sanders has denounced all super PACs and will continue to fight for the future of the middle class. As a mother of two young daughters, their future is my priority, which is why I am endorsing Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.”
A win in Nevada would demonstrate that Sanders can win beyond his white progressive base of support. During well in Nevada would demolish the electability argument against Sen. Sanders.
If Clinton and Sanders split the first four states, Democrats could have a competitive primary on their hands. The media's constant and unyielding obsession with Trump is hiding the fact the Democratic Party is holding an important and substantial primary. Democrats have two strong candidates who are challenging each other with different strategies and ideas.
CNN and MSNBC's pro-Trump bias is doing a major disservice to the nation's voters. It may take a Bernie Sanders upset in Nevada to get the media's attention and break Trump's stranglehold on the coverage.

This follows a successful implementation of a pilot program, where the 47-member consortium used technology from blockchain start-up Ripple for a cloud-based payments platform called RC Cloud. The platform allows member banks to do real-time money transfers in Japan as well as make cross-border payments at a significantly lower cost.
"The objective of the consortium is to make domestic and cross-border payment efficient by taking advantage of the latest distributed ledger technology available in the world," Emi Yoshikawa, Ripple's director of joint venture partnership, told CNBC.
The consortium was launched in October and represents over 30 percent of all banks in Japan, according to Yoshikawa . Members include AEON Bank, Nomura Trust and Banking, Resona Bank and Mizuho.
Many small banks that process low volumes of payments have to rely on their larger peers to clear the transactions because of a high fixed annual cost for membership at the clearing houses. As a result, they have little control over the fees they are charged per transaction, making it expensive and unprofitable.
"Existing infrastructure favor high-volume processors," Dilip Rao, managing director for Asia Pacific at Ripple, told CNBC. "(They) get the cheapest price."
This is where blockchain — which is the basis for Ripple's technology — comes in. It records and stores all of the transactions online securely on a peer-to-peer network, which eliminates the need to have an intermediary bank or a central hub to do the clearing and settlement.
"With distributed ledger technology, it doesn't matter because the little guy can speak to another little guy and it's just as cheap if they did 10,000 transactions or two," Rao said.
According to analysis done by Ripple, looking at retail remittances and corporate payments, distributed ledger technology has the potential to bring down transaction costs by 60 and 50 percent, respectively.
Yoshikawa said she expects 10 to 20 more banks to join the consortium this year, which will bring the total number of members to between 50 and 60 — about 40 percent of all Japanese banks. The commercial phase of RC Cloud is expected to start in the fall of this year.
While Japan's adoption of technology is diverse — from smartphones to smart cars — its banking system has traditionally been conservative in adopting new technologies and systems.
But in a bid to become a key fintech player in the region, Japanese authorities and banks are taking note of blockchain.
The Bank of Japan has talked about exploring distributed ledger technology and its potential uses. Last year, the central bank announced a joint research project on blockchain with the European Central Bank.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, a member of the global blockchain consortium R3 and one of Japan's largest financial institutions, is looking to develop its own digital currency, MUFG Coin, for potential, large-scale commercialization and to serve small-scale retail bank customers.
Rao said Japan was very different to the rest of the world when it came to new developments in fintech like blockchain.
"They have had a lot of interest in bitcoin, blockchain and is more aware of crypto-currencies."

The Pentagon has placed a small number of U.S. advisors on the ground in Yemen to support Arab forces battling al-Qaeda, military officials said on Friday, signaling a new American role in that country's multi-sided civil war.
Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. personnel had been in the country for about two weeks, supporting Yemeni and Emirati forces that are fighting a pitched battle against militants near the southeastern port city of Mukalla.
“We view this as short-term,” Davis told reporters.
Officials said the U.S. military is also providing Emirati forces with medical, intelligence and maritime support, and is flying surveillance and aerial refueling missions. It has also staged a ship from the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit off Yemen's coast. The flotilla includes the USS Boxer, an amphibious assault ship with Marine infantry and aircraft, and two destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Gonzalez.
Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the United States was helping the Arab forces plan operations as part of its “limited” mission in and around Mukalla.
“We welcome operations undertaken by Yemeni Forces, with the support of Arab Coalition Forces, to liberate the Yemeni port city of Mukalla from control by al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP),” Ryder said in an email.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive operations, said that the U.S. presence, approved at the request of the United Arab Emirates, was “way small.”
Even a tiny military footprint marks a milestone for U.S. involvement in the Yemeni conflict, which brought an end a year and a half ago to a long-running U.S. mission there against AQAP.
After the internationally recognized Yemeni government, unable to contain Shiite Houthi rebels, collapsed at the end of 2014, the United States was forced to pull out Special Operations troops who had been training and advising their Yemeni peers.
[Yemen is turning into Saudi Arabia's Vietnam]
The departure was a blow to U.S. efforts to battle AQAP, which has long been considered the most menacing al-Qaeda branch and which has seized on the chaos of the ongoing conflict to strengthen its military position.
Since then, the United States has confined its military activities mostly to supporting a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthi rebels, which the Kingdom sees as an Iranian proxy force. The Pentagon has provided some intelligence and aerial support to the Saudi-led air war.
The new American advisory team will support the Emirati troops and Yemeni forces loyal to the old government as they seek to capi­tal­ize on recent headway against AQAP in Mukalla, which was seized by militants last year. Saudi Special Operations forces have also been taking part in the campaign against AQAP around Mukalla.
Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said the U.S. presence would reinforce an encouraging trend. “This is exactly the type of [situation] where a little bit of American support goes a long way,” he said.
President Obama's preference for using small Special Operations teams to conduct targeted operations or advise partner forces has been a hallmark of his global security strategy.
American officials also considered the Mukalla offensive a success because it marked an unprecedented coalition action against AQAP. U.S. officials have long encouraged Saudi Arabia to broaden its focus in Yemen beyond the Houthis, and have also complained of high civilian casualties in a conflict that has killed at least 6,000 people.
The United Nations continues to seek a political solution in peace talks in Kuwait City.
Military officials declined to say what type of U.S. personnel were on the ground in Yemen or provide their exact location. “They are not in harm's way,” the U.S. official said.
[U.S. targets al-Qaeda in Yemen airstrike that kills dozens, Pentagon says]
Even after the end of its training mission, the United States has tried to contain AQAP's growth using periodic airstrikes of its own.
Davis said the United States has conducted four strikes against al-Qaeda militants since April 23, killing 10 militants and wounding one. In March the Pentagon announced it had killed more than 70 al-Qaeda fighters in Yemen in one of the largest U.S. strikes conducted in the country since the beginning of operations there.
According to a Long War Journal database, the United States has conducted roughly 140 airstrikes in Yemen since 2002.

Whilst at high school I ran a multi-cultural youth group in London called ‘Subrang' meaning ‘all colours' in hindi which allowed me to use my social and organizing skills to interact with boys and girls from different cultural backgrounds and arrange fun activities.
It was during this time (1990s) I realized I had an edge with people and the parents told me they trusted me as a leader because I involved everyone and was focused and creative. My confidence grew and I was itching to put my skills to use in the commercial sector.
My first salaried job was working in trendy and upcoming Docklands for a publishing company which introduced me to the world of marketing, I loved it.
I got paid to talk and write! My two passions.
I set up Aneela Rose PR in 2004 after working in the manufacturing and engineering sectors for 8 years.
I was fed up reporting to Managers who didn't understand PR and I felt I was good enough to work for myself. Best decision I made.
Within a month of becoming self-employed, I won my first client Amberley Castle as an editor friend of mine recommended me to the Castle.
Very quickly after that I was fortunate to win another two clients in the food sector and my PR success story began.
I worked from home to keep my costs down.
Q: The majority of your team are females. Was that just by chance or you prefer to deal with women more in PR? Can you call that a trend in UK?
We have three men and four females so we are fairly evenly spread which is actually quite unusual for a UK PR agency. The mix of personalities, ages, backgrounds, experience and genders works incredibly well as each person brings a uniqueness to the table and a different point of view. When we are brainstorming creative ideas, there is a quirky mix of thinking which leads to colourful meetings!
Q: Say a company has asked me to recommend a UK PR firm for them. How can I answer such a question in a professional way?
It really depends on the type of PR the company requires, is it of a technical nature working in niche markets or do they wish to target the public with a mass consumer campaign? PR agencies have varying specialisms and contacts so you need to find out what the company is looking to promote, which geographical areas do they wish to target, are they looking for offline and online PR, available budget etc.
Q: How different is the PR scene in UK compared to the US / Australia? Would you write your Press Release in the same manner in both continents?
PR in the UK has changed.
No longer can agencies hide behind just traditional PR implementation.
They now have to integrate Paid, Earned, Shared and Owned media (PESO model) to deliver integrated marketing campaigns to meet changing client requirements.
Agencies not only have to keep up but keep ahead of the game, it's a daily challenge for us!
Joining up social media and digital marketing with offline PR is a game changer for our industry.
UK PR agencies now require the resources, knowledge, technical abilities and forward thinking to succeed or they will get left behind.
Press releases always need to be written and targeted to a specific audience and publication, so although they follow a familiar format across the world, their content, tone, style and length needs to tailored accordingly.
Electronic distribution is still the preferred method and using newswires is increasingly effective to reach international audiences.
Q: How would you deal with a client who insists on going against your suggestions?
I've worked in the PR industry for 20 years now and over the years.
I've trained myself to be objective and humble when dealing with clients!
I appreciate that my client probably knows their customer better than I do.
But I would start by asking the client why they are making this suggestion and what is the business driver for it.
I would suggest other creative ideas that convey the same message and achieve the same goal and hope they would agree with my thinking.
I can be very persuasive as I try and back up everything I say with evidence and a whopping smile!
Q: In your post as a founder and MD of Aneela Rose PR, what reasons would force you to fire a client?
As an agency owner, the last thing I want is to lose a client.
But there have been times when we are better off without a client and I've had to make a tricky decision.
It's not always about profit, although important it's about the consequences of continuing to work with that client, such as the demands they are making, resources, ethics, relationships with the team and continual compromises we make.
I take a more holistic view of the consequences, as resigning a client can be beneficial and an important factor for the future of our agency.
One client I had run a dating agency in London and although the fee was good, over time she became so irrational, unpredictable and demanding that we simply didn't want to work with her any longer, no matter the budget.
So we said goodbye and it was such a huge relief for my team!
When you get into this situation you do need to learn from it.
What mistakes were made, was it pricing, were they not a good fit for our agency, was it a specific issue that arose, whatever it was, ensure you understand the problem and try not to repeat the same mistake.
Q: Share with us some the funniest, most bizarre, and totally unexpected situations you faced with your clients in any given day of Aneela Rose PR work.
There have been a few! The most memorable is sitting in a 4×4 jeep on the runway at Gatwick Airport ready to sound the bird dispersal horns to prevent birdstrike! We were literally driving onto the runway in between every landing, amazing adrenaline rush.
I've interviewed some fascinating people including rogue trader Nick Leeson, Coronation Street killer ‘Richard Hillman' played by actor Brian Capron and property magnate Nicholas Van Hoogstraten.
I've bumped into HRH Prince Phillip at an international trade conference, had a slap-up dinner with comedian Eddie Izzard and his stage crew and failed to impress legendary cricketer Imran Khan with my bowling skills!
Q: Is the classic Press Release still relevant in spreading the word in this time of the internet and social media?
No, it's not always the right approach but it's what clients seem to understand and know about.
I've previously talked about the growth of social media and this is where it has all changed, so we are now educating our clients about using new online methods to reach their customers.
Using Google Analytics to monitor website traffic and audience behaviours, ensuring all copywriting, keywords, search terms are SEO friendly and monitored and updated regularly.
It's not just about the traditional press release working in isolation any longer, it has advanced far beyond that now to achieve tangible results for clients. -Aneela Rose
Q: Online or Print – which one would you recommend for your clients? And why?
We incorporate both into our work as print is still alive and kicking in certain sectors such as manufacturing and engineering.
Their audiences often favour print as they can be more traditional in their thinking and prefer to read articles in the printed magazines rather than digitally.
We tailor our releases for each publication, so it is relevant and gives it a better chance of showing up there.
The two leading publications in the UK for these sectors are themanufacturer.com and theengineer.co.uk.
Both have printed magazines but their online portals are more active and a hive of news and information.
We target both print and online but securing coverage in the printed versions gives us brownie points with our clients!
Q: What are the new trends in Public Relations that are currently happening? How would PR be different 10 years from now?
The divide between PR, Marketing, Advertising and Digital will be non-existent.
There won't be separate agencies for PR focusing on just media or Advertising creating just ads or Digital working solely online or Marketing for everything else; it will all roll into one. It's that simple.
It will be about thought-out partnerships and working in collaboration with experts in specific fields rather than everyone working on the same thing together with generalist knowledge.
It will be about working smarter, cheaper and at warp-speed combining offline with online.

Q: Would you ever consider branching out of UK ? Have you ever been to Dubai, UAE? Would you consider getting into the Middle East PR arena?
I haven't yet been to Dubai but I'm planning to travel there this summer.
Yes, I would love to undertake more international work but I need to understand the market and requirements.
It is a very exciting proposition and I would welcome opportunities to expand my network and use my knowledge and skills to help companies in the Middle East.

Sean Gallup/Getty Images Headscarves a barrier on German job market: report Wearing a headscarf and having a Turkish name made it harder to get a job interview.
German women who wear a headscarf and have a Turkish name must write four times more cover letters than other job seekers to be offered an interview, according to a study released Tuesday.
Researchers from the IZA-Institute for the Study of Labor sent nearly 1,500 fictitious applications for secretary jobs in Germany: some using a typical German name, others with a Turkish name and a last group with a Turkish name that included a picture of the female applicant wearing a headscarf.
The applicant without the headscarf was invited for a job interview in 18.8 percent of cases, compared to 13.5 percent for the woman with the Turkish name and 4.2 percent for the applicant with the Turkish name and headscarf.
All the fictitious applications described a candidate with a good knowledge of the German language and a German education, leading the reports' authors to suggest discrimination may make it more difficult for migrant women to find work, rather than lower qualifications — often blamed for the group's higher unemployment rate.

Google I/O is one of the hottest tickets in town, and gaining entry to today's keynote and the rest of the sessions that are going on this week is no small feat. Yet that didn't stop two protesters, who began screaming out their complaints against company officials at different times during the 2.5-hour long keynote before being dragged away by security. Both protesters were part of local tenants' rights activist groups, Eviction Free San Francisco and the Anti Eviction Mapping Project.
The first protester to stand up was Claudia Tirado, a third grade teacher at San Francisco's Fairmount Elementary School, who currently faces eviction from her home in the Mission District — just minutes away from where Google's press conference took place. Tirado rose suddenly in the middle of a presentation by Google's Android engineering director David Burke, who somehow managed to keep going on as if nothing was happening.
Protesters targeted Google's lawyer and robotics company
"You need to develop a conscience, Google," Tirado yelled while holding up a T-shirt urging people to stop Google's lawyer Jack Halprin. Halprin owns the seven-unit Victorian building where Tirado and her family live, and is reportedly trying to evict them using a controversial piece of California legislation called the Ellis Act to take the entire building off the rental market and evict rent-controlled tenants. The other protester let loose on Google for what he called "machines that kill people," a reference to the company's acquisition of robotic engineering company Boston Dynamics last December.
Erin McElroy, one of the protest's organizers, told The Verge that Tirado got into the show by receiving a pass donated by a sympathetic attendee. The conference cost $900 to attend, though tickets were extremely limited, causing Google only to offer them as part of a lottery system to interested developers. She stood in line to get in, took her seat, then jumped in front during the demonstration of the new version of Android, walking right past security guards, she says. After making her point, Tirado was escorted out by security guards, interviewed by Google VP of communications Rachel Whetstone, then released.
"I was scared before I did it, and didn't know what I was going to do," says Tirado. "But I'm really happy about how it came out."
"One of our demands of Google is to make Jack Halprin rescind the eviction," says McElroy, whose groups Eviction Free San Francisco and the Anti Eviction Mapping Project were responsible for organizing these protests, and others that have taken place in San Francisco over the past few months.
Activists view the eviction as a prime example of the broader problems caused by San Francisco's recent tech boom. An average rental in the city now costs $3,200, meaning that lower- and middle-income residents who are forced into the rental market often have to leave the city. That change has spread out to surrounding areas like Oakland, where median home prices have nearly doubled in the past two years.
When asked whether she believed Google had a legal right to intervene in its employees' personal lives in this manner, McElroy responded, "We're asking for Google to take a stand on the eviction crisis and acknowledge that its employees are directly responsible for the displacement we're seeing." Tirado says she has until February 26th to remain in her apartment, and says she can't afford to stick around if the eviction goes through.
Protesters gather outside of Google I/O. (Annette Bernhardt / Facebook)
The outbursts were just the latest in a series of protests organized by Bay Area locals, who have blamed Google and other technology companies for raising the cost of living. Along with the two inside, protesters gathered outside of San Francisco's Moscone Center (where I/O is taking place) to publicly chide the company over a number of issues, from the evictions to taxes and investments in local communities.
Not the first protests for Google
Other complaints have centered on the buses that ferry tech workers between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where most of the companies are headquartered. A new pilot program, which begins August 1st, will let commuter shuttles rely on certain whitelisted public-transit infrastructure like bus stops as long as the companies pay a fee and agrees to operate only during certain hours. Citizens have complained that the companies were making unfair use of the stops, and have continued to find faults in the proposed solution.
In a statement, Google said that thousands of its employees live in the Bay Area, and that the company wants to be "good" neighbors. "Since 2011 we've given more than $70 million to local projects and employees have volunteered thousands of hours in the community," a spokesperson told The Verge. "We're excited to be expanding that work in 2014 with the recent Bay Area Impact Challenge winners — several of them have even joined us at I/O." (The Impact Challenge is a Google-sponsored competition for grants given to nonprofits with ideas for improving local Bay Area communities.)
While fleeting, the scenario was highly unusual for what's considered the inner sanctum of a high-profile press conference. It's frequent to see protesters outside of press conferences and shareholders meetings from publicly-traded technology companies, though not inside an event where people pay hundreds and even thousands of dollars to attend, and are often vetted ahead of time. Today, that wasn't enough to let a few slips by.
It remains to be seen whether this up-close-and-personal encounter between Google and its detractors will result in something more substantial than the usual parrying of message points. Tirado said that during her escalator chat with Whetstone, the VP told her she was "sympathetic," and the two exchanged contact info, Whetstone intimating that she would "look into the matter."
"I really hope she's being genuine and can find the right person in the Google world to talk to Jack," says Tirado. Laughing, she imagined a scenario where everybody wins. "They could say, ‘This publicity is costing us a lot of money! Look, you can get a little bonus if you don't evict this person!' That's what I'm hoping."
Update June 25th, 8:36PM: Added comments from Tirado on the protest.
Hull KR have lost just one of their six home games this season
Hull KR chief executive Mike Smith has labelled the Rugby Football League's decision to move his side's home game against Castleford "a joke".
They were originally scheduled to take on the Tigers on Sunday, 7 June but the game has been moved to Friday, 5 June.
Castleford asked for the game to be switched to give them more rest before their game against Leeds on the following Thursday, 11 June.
Smith told the club website the decision "left a sour taste".
He continued: "We received a request to change the fixture in mid-February, which we rejected at the time, and we have been arguing our case for the RFL to overturn their decision ever since.
"Castleford have known they would be playing Leeds on the Thursday night since mid-October and waited until the middle of February to act, which is totally unfair on our club and our supporters.
"The decision from the RFL has been made on player welfare grounds to allow a minimum of a five-day turnaround between fixtures, yet clubs are asked to play two games in four days over the Easter period.
"Now that we have progressed through to the Challenge Cup quarter-finals, we will also have to arrange a midweek fixture against Salford Red Devils. Will the RFL be able to accommodate both clubs the way they have with Castleford? I don't think so."
Chris Chester's side are currently ninth in Super League and reached the last eight of the Challenge Cup with a surprise win against Wigan.
Environment Living fest over dying Yamuna By
Reading Time: 5 minutes
Gangescha, Yamuneschaiba, Godavari Saraswati Narmade Sindhu Kaveri Jaloshmin Sannidhe Bhaba…
Kurukhetra Gaya Ganga prabhasa puskaranicha yetani punyatirthani snana sankalpa kaale bhabantu iha…
Vedic shlokas such as the above say that Indians have been traditionally invoking seven holy rivers – Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Saraswati, Narmada, Sindhu and Kaveri – while taking a bath. To be more specific, they invoke the purity of these rivers.
So, even if I am taking a dip in far off Mahanadi in the eastern state of Odisha, I am swearing by the purity of Ganga, Yamuna or the other five rivers.
Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to take a dip in the Yamuna these days, let alone swearing by its purity. That's especially in the Delhi stretch of 22 kilometers, from Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage.
Twenty-two drains, carrying waste water including sewage, fall into the river in this stretch. In Delhi, Yamuna has been reduced to a drain.
When spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's Art of Living (AOL) Foundation decided to hold the world's largest cultural and spiritual fest, ‘World Culture Festival', at such a polluted stretch of Yamuna, one expected that attention of culture loving persons from across the globe will be drawn to the plight of the Yamuna.
That would not only have showcased Indian cultures (invariably ingrained with respect for holy rivers) but also promoted values of plurality by bringing in people from 155 countries.
But the organizers of the fest, scheduled for March 11-13, kept saying that the venue is at a safe distance from the river bed, perhaps meaning, no participant – from among the three and half millions expected – will have to bear the stink of the heavily polluted river.
What they don't want to admit that the area where the fest is being organized belongs to Yamuna's fragile floodplains.
A river is not just a flow of water
This is perhaps because the ‘environmental concerns', towards which Sri Sri Ravi Shankar as well as his spokespersons claim to be working since long, do not recognize the importance of floodplains as an integrated component of river systems.
For laymen, a river is just visible in the flow of water, and environment means trees. In reality, river systems are much more than that.
Floodplains provide the necessary cushion for the river's high peak discharges during flood times and host and keep alive a very vital ecosystem for the river.
Yamuna may be highly polluted, but the low lying and other floodplains are essential spaces for the biodiversity – including grass, bushes, birds, trees and other such vitalities.
The activists, who filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against AOL's cultural fest, argued exactly this and pleaded the tribunal to stop the damage by cancelling permission for the event.
The NGT took up the case and engaged a four-member expert committee that confirmed that huge damage had already been done by the ongoing constructions.
The committee pointed out that the Yamuna floodplains had already suffered “extensive and severe damage” by the preparatory construction activities and recommended that the AOL should pay Rs.100-120 crore towards restoration of the same.
The expert committee found that the floodplain between the river and a nearby flyover has been levelled flat for providing VIP access to the stage and small water bodies that existed earlier have been filled up. All the natural vegetation has been removed and the site has been compacted, it added.
“Natural vegetation consisting of reeds and trees has been completely removed, and the large number of birds and other natural life that was supported by the floodplain has vanished,” said the report.
NGT also observed that not only the AOL but almost all government agencies responsible for maintaining the environment have violated laws to permit Sri Sri's mega event.
However, despite clear violation of NGT's own ruling of January 2015, which has barred all activities in Yamuna floodplains, the tribunal could not stop the event.
Loss for Yamuna, loss for river system
On March 9, it allowed the fest albeit with some riders and provided AOL paid a fine of Rs.5 crore in advance. AOL saved its face as the tribunal considered the fact that the preparations for the fest were at a very advanced stage and pointed out that the case against it was filed too late by the activists.
This is an interim order only. Hopefully the final order will charge a penalty of Rs.120 crore rupees to the AOL.
Sri Sri and AOL win (I do not know if the spiritual master wins morally or spiritually). But Yamuna loses. Ignorance about river system wins, ecosystems lose.
Floodplains are already fighting a losing battle in India. Flood devastations in Chennai have not taught us any lesson and the wrong precedence the NGT has started with this order will never let us learn any.
I only wish the spiritual gurus, who claim to be doing a lot to conserve and rejuvenate our rivers, understood the river systems in their spiritual, socio-cultural and ecological totality. Spirituality and river systems cannot go separate ways.

YouTube has introduced paid subscriptions in India, but we're not sure if it has any takers. The one channel with Indian content that we found, Bhakti Times, from MiMedia, is priced at Rs 65 per month. Its first video went live three weeks ago, and it's not clear whether it has any subscribers. YouTube's list of public paid channels has only 26 listed, and these can all be subscribed to from India. The service was apparently rolled out very quietly, late in December 2013. The company, however, did not comment on which channels have begun offering paid subscriptions in India. YouTube presently allows paid subscription in 15 out of the 61 countries in which it is present. Other countries include Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom and United States.
In a statement, YouTube told MediaNama that:
“We've been building a YouTube partner program since 2007 that enables content creators to earn revenue for their creativity. We've watched them build amazing channels that have made YouTube into a news, education and entertainment destination one billion people around the world cannot do without. Paid Channels is the next step in rolling out more monetization options for creators in India, offering paid channels to channels in good standing with at least 10,000 existing subscribers. ”
Eligibility criteria: Content partners need to fulfill the following criteria to get an approved paid subscriptions channel:
Hold a good standing: the YouTube account should not have faced any copyright strikes, no breech of community guidelines, and not more than one video blocked worldwide
Meet the general criteria for YouTube Partner Program
Hold an account verified by phone
Hold an approved AdSense account linked to the YouTube account
Own a free channel with at least 10,000 active subscribers
And should be located in one of the listed countries
Channels containing content in multiple languages are required to disclose the list of languages.
Subscription prices can be set based on the retail prices suggested by Google. The valid retail price range set for India is between Rs 5 to Rs 20,000, though as per YouTube's policy, the set price should end in 5: for example, Rs 95, 105, 125. All new subscribers receive a 14 day free trial period. Subscribers may be billed monthly or annually. By default, YouTube does not run ads on channels with paid subscriptions. However, content partners may enable ads on their paid channels, allowing for a mix of advertising and subscription revenue. Partners get 55% of the revenue, whether advertising or subscription based, from what we've heard.
Content partners may also package multiple channels for a paid subscription offer. It is important to note that enabling paid subscription on a free channel would automatically unsubscribe all existing subscribers. It is not clear if the channel can enable paid subscriptions in all the countries that have the feature.
Content owners can also provide an ads-free version of an ad-supported channel. Apart from this, paid channels can feature both free and paid videos: for this content owners will have to change the free or paid status of individual videos in the paid channel.
MediaNama's take (by Nikhil Pahwa)
It's important to note that by ensuring that content creators do not convert existing free-to-stream channels into paid ones, YouTube is keeping its advertising revenue stream largely unaffected. Channels with substantial subscribers would otherwise be tempted to cut off access to content for their subscribers, like a paywall. Instead, channel owners are now more likely to set up a separate paid channel, and promote it on their existing content.
The option of having paid subscription along with free videos can now enable content makers to monetize some of their premium content. This could work quite for niche content, especially education, where the viewers have a clear idea of what they are looking for.
Entertainment channels could also use this feature to make viewers pay for latest films that they would like to watch, which means that YouTube will provide competition for subscription based service providers like BoxTV, Spuul, Sony LIV, ErosNOW and others, but this invariably depends on whether content owner are willing to forgo advertising revenue for subscription revenue (and limited reach).
Lets also not forget that India is a graveyard of online premium content subscription services: they launch paid, then typically switch to freemium, and eventually switch to free-to-air, before shutting down.

WASHINGTON (AFNS) -- Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, was selected as the new home for the Air Force's first operational overseas F-35A Lightning IIs.
Air Force officials chose Eielson AFB after a lengthy analysis of the location's operational considerations, installation attributes, environmental factors and cost.
“Alaska combines a strategically important location with a world-class training environment. Basing the F-35s at Eielson AFB will allow the Air Force the capability of using the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex (JPARC) for large force exercises using a multitude of ranges and maneuver areas in Alaska,” said Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James. "This, combined with the largest airspace in the Air Force, ensures realistic combat training for the (Defense Department).”
Proximity to the JPARC will enable the Air Force to take advantage of approximately 65,000 square miles of available airspace for realistic, world-class training in the Air Force's most advanced fifth-generation fighter.
The decision culminates a three-year process that included an extensive environmental impact statement that examined impacts on such factors as air quality, noise, land use and socioeconomics.
"The decision to base two F-35 squadrons at Eielson AFB, Alaska, combined with the existing F-22 Raptors at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, will double our fifth-generation fighter aircraft presence in the Pacific theater," said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Welsh III. "Integrating that fifth-generation force with Navy, Marine, and allied F-35 forces will provide joint and coalition warfighters unprecedented survivability, lethality and battlespace awareness in contested environments. It's an exciting time for Pacific airpower."
The base is projected to receive two squadrons of F-35As, which will join the wing's F-16 Fighting Falcon aggressor squadron currently assigned to Eielson AFB.
On-base construction to prepare for the aircraft is expected to start in fiscal year 2017 in order to be ready to accept the first F-35As, which are currently scheduled to begin arriving in 2020.
Preliminary estimates had the new aircraft arriving a year earlier, but officials say the 2020 arrival will provide the Air Force more time and grow its active-duty maintenance force.
“The Air Force is facing a shortage of experienced, active-duty fighter aircraft maintainers as we transition from legacy aircraft to the F-35A,” said Lt. Gen. John B. Cooper, the deputy chief of staff the Air Force for logistics, installations and mission support. “Adjusting the initial plan and slightly accelerating F-35A arrivals at Burlington Air Guard Station, Burlington, Vermont, to fall 2019 will allow the service to stick to the overall F-35 rollout schedule, while capitalizing on the Air National Guard's experienced fighter aircraft maintenance force as we put additional measures in place to increase the number of trained active-duty maintainers.”
The F-35A, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is a fifth-generation fighter aircraft intended to be the Air Force's premier strike aircraft through the first half of the 21st century. It is a multi-role fighter that is expected to eventually replace the service's legacy air-to-ground fighter fleets.
More than 20,000 people in various venues in London attended the British Zionist Federation's “Minute for Munich” program that was promoted via social media.
A short memorial service at the Israeli Embassy that was organized by the Zionist Federation was streamed live online today, according to the London Jewish Chronicle.
About 200 people marked the Minute for Munich in Trafalgar Square, reciting memorial prayers and lighting memorial candles. Afterwards, they waved British and Israeli flags in front of media who attended the event.

“The British Jewish community is showing its solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Israel,” the British Israel Coalition's Ari Soffer told the crowd, according to the Chronicle. “We should not allow this tragedy to go uncommemorated. This is a time to show our respect and remember the dead.”
The families of the victims of the 1972 Munich massacre, in which 11 Israeli Olympics athletes and coaches were murdered by Palestinian terrorists, have mounted a global campaign to get the International Olympic Committee to hold an official moment of silence at the Games.
The IOC continues to reject the call, despite its being endorsed by President Obama, GOP presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney, the U.S. Senate, the German Bundestag, the Canadian and Australian parliaments, about 50 members of the British Parliament, the Israeli government, Jewish organizations worldwide and about 100 members of Australia's Parliament.
IOC president Jacques Rogge on Friday said the IOC had not been pressed by any government to hold a moment of silence.
“There has been no pressure from any nation whatsoever,” Rogge said. “The IOC has always honored the memory of the victims of Munich '72.”
Rogge led a minute of silence for the victims inside the athletes village on Monday, will attend a private ceremony in London during the games and will take part in a commemoration on the 40th anniversary on Sept. 5 at the Munich airport where most of the Israelis died.
“We have always commemorated and will continue to commemorate the memory of the killed athletes,” he said.
FOXBORO, Mass. — Duron Harmon is more important to the New England Patriots' defense than one might originally believe. Just ask Bill Belichick. He'll go on, and on and on about the free safety in unusually intricate detail.
Did you know Harmon, with a unique view of the field in the deep half of the secondary, consults with Patriots coaches to help dictate Patriots coverage adjustments on the fly?
“With Duron and Devin (McCourty) back there, those are two very smart players,” Belichick said last week. “So it's not unusual during the course of the game to ask them or for them to comment on something that's happening or isn't happening and how the quarterback is reading a certain coverage or a certain look or where receivers are located and so forth. …
“It's something where I've been fortunate to have a lot of guys throughout my career who have really done a good job with that and Devin and Duron I would say are two very good ones.”
THE RUTGERS EDUCATION
Harmon possessed that ability dating back to his time playing under Greg Schiano at Rutgers, but early in his career he relayed what he saw through fellow free safety Devin McCourty.
“Now he's straight to Matty P. (defensive coordinator Matt Patricia), talks with Bill, so I think his growth is just being here and maturing,” McCourty said.
Harmon has started just 10 games in his four-year NFL career. He's listed on the roster as a defensive back, but he best can be categorized as a nickel defender or backup free safety. But that's short-changing Harmon, who really is more like the Kevin Faulk of the Patriots' modern defense.
He's not a starter only because the Patriots have an elite free safety already on their roster, and they mostly open games in their base defense while Harmon primarily plays in nickel. Pro Football Focus grades Harmon as the NFL's 14th-best free safety despite being a backup.
He's also one of the Patriots' most approachable players, so when the Patriots acquired Eric Rowe from the Philadelphia Eagles, Rowe leaned on Harmon to learn the defense. Rowe continues to depend on him as he receives more playing time because Harmon and McCourty help align the defense from safety.
“It's the best thing,” Rowe said. “If you're new, trying to learn the system, they know safety and corner and linebacker responsibilities. They definitely made it a lot easier for me to get on the field faster.”
ABILITY AND DEPENDABILITY
Harmon won't be found near the line of scrimmage in run defense often, and he's not the strongest defender in man coverage, but he's as dependable as it comes at doing his job as a rangy free safety. He's never missed a game in his career, could start on many teams.
He also hits free agency this offseason, although Belichick likely won't let him go easily.
“He's very well-respected,” Belichick said. “He's smart, he works hard, he studies, he trains hard. I'll go even back to his first year, he and Logan Ryan, the day after the season, they're in here working out, doing extra stuff in the weight room, here working out in January. Things like that. Just not like, ‘Hey, Coach I'm here. Make sure you know I'm here. I'm putting in extra time.' They would do it just to do it. …
“I think he understands … how interdependent you are on everybody else (in the secondary), kind of like the offensive line. Even if one guy does the right thing, if somebody else doesn't, then it's a problem for all of us. So, getting everybody on the same page, communication, making sure that you know where your help is, where I'm going to be, I know where you're going to be, so we can work together with each other. Duron is very good at those kinds of things and also dependable, where if he says he's there, he's going to be there.”
Harmon isn't one to get complacent, despite the praise.
“I'll tell you this about this defense,” Harmon said. “The minute you think you got it, something will come and bite you in the butt. It's just experience. The longer you're doing something, I've been in this defense it's my fourth year, so I got a good grasp of it. Do I have the best grasp, like a defensive coach? No, but I know enough to help people get them aligned and have everybody out there on the same page.”
It's thanks to Harmon and McCourty that the Patriots' defense has limited big plays this season, as one of just three teams that has only allowed one receiving play of over 40 yards this season.
“Trust in those guys to be able to roam as much as they can and cover as much as they do, you have to be able to be smart, because obviously if you make the wrong read, that's a big play,” Patriots defensive captain Dont'a Hightower said.
WHAT BILL BELICHICK LEARNED FROM BILL RUSSELL
Because of his smarts, skill, work ethic and dependability, Harmon earned rare effusive praise from Belichick on Friday.
“Duron is, I'd say every team, or most every team I've ever coached, there are always a couple guys on the team that I would say, for lack of a better word, that are silent leaders,” Belichick said. “They have leadership but it kind of comes out in a little bit of a different way than Junior Seau or Tedy Bruschi or somebody like that. Again, I'm not saying one is better than the other, they're just different, and I would put Duron kind of in the silent leader category.
“But I would say, and Bill Russell taught me this, that in a way, a silent leader in some respects is more powerful than a more vocal leader because you hear the vocal guy, you see him, you're very aware of it, but then there are guys that give you that quiet leadership that in a way is more powerful because it's not quite out there as much, but it's that quiet push that sometimes can maybe have a little more impetus. So you could put Duron in that category. …
“If he says something, you can count on it. He'll be there, he'll come through, and he'll deliver it.”
Harmon appreciated his coach's words.
“A guy who's accomplished so much in this game looking at me as a leader, I mean, it's nothing that I go around telling everybody, but it's something I try to carry myself the right way, do the right things, and those words really meant a lot,” Harmon said.

A new financing plan for a Minnesota Vikings stadium ran into immediate trouble Monday at the state Capitol, but had enough momentum to pass its first test in the House.
Hours after Gov. Mark Dayton and the chief Senate author of the legislation criticized a key ingredient of the new proposal, a House panel adopted the plan and sent it on its wobbly way.
The plan to fund the nearly $1 billion stadium could get more hearings in both the House and Senate this week before the Legislature begins a 10-day spring break. No Senate panel has yet approved the plan and any stadium deal likely faces choppy political seas as stadium supporters race against GOP hopes to adjourn the Legislature by month's end.
The proposal presented Sunday by Republicans in the House would create funding backstops for the state's share of stadium costs. It quickly drew criticism from several corners, and Dayton said a provision to also allow so-called tip board betting on professional sports games would violate federal laws against sports betting.
"It doesn't strike me at first glance as a viable option," the governor said.
"Do you think the governor's assessment is not entirely accurate?" Rep. Sheldon Johnson, DFL-St. Paul, asked at the hearing.
King Wilson, the executive director of Allied Charities of Minnesota, an umbrella group for the charities, said he felt certain that tip boards would be deemed legal and were different from outright sports bookmaking. A tip board, he said, is simply a numerical game that is not based on which team wins a particular game. "It does not matter who wins or loses," said Wilson.
The charities estimate that the new games would bring in $16 million a year.
But an analyst for the House panel told the committee he was unsure the provision could survive a court challenge. And earlier in the day, Tom Barrett, executive director of Minnesota Gambling Control Board, said New Jersey is trying to challenge the ban, but that the tip boards remained illegal.
Others tried to look past any legal issues surrounding tip boards. "This is going to help a lot of small businesses like mine," Dan O'Gara, the owner of O'Gara's Bar and Grill in St. Paul, said of the tip-board proposal. "This is going to help people stay in our business."
Both Dayton and Sen. Julie Rosen, R-Fairmont, the chief Senate author of stadium legislation, were visibly upset with not being made aware of the key features of the House plan, which features a $36 million tax break for the charitable gambling industry that reflected the wishes of House Speaker Kurt Zellers.
"Not telling the governor was a big mistake," Rosen said Monday.
"I'm part of the game here, too,'' she said. "I should have been told."
Rosen said she was lukewarm to the proposal. "I think it's got some issues if people think, or perceive to think, that it's unlawful," she said.
Dayton also warned that the legal questions surrounding tip boards would not pass muster with the bond houses that will be needed to finance construction of a new stadium. The state must come up with nearly $400 million for its share, which has left state leaders groping for the roughly $42 million a year needed to make debt payments without tapping the state's general fund.
Hennepin County officials also huddled with lawyers on Monday over a separate provision that would tap excess county sales tax money for Target Field as another funding backup.
"That's a travesty," said Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin. "It is breaking faith with the people of Hennepin County. They are scrambling because they can't find their own solution to this problem, so they are taking other people's money. It's obscene."
County lawyers discussed Monday whether, depending on the wording of the final bill, the state could take the money without board approval. Even Rep. Morrie Lanning, R-Moorhead, the chief House author of the legislation, said he was unsure.
"This should give all levels of governments some heartburn," Hennepin County Board Chairman Mike Opat said. "I am against this because they are backing up [a] state revenue shortfall with a local tax."
Zellers said Monday he will not work actively for or against the stadium proposal.
"If it fits in with the schedule, as long as it's moving forward on a fair vote, I think it's proceeding along," he said. "I'm not going to exert any undue pressure to hurry it up or to slow it down."
Hours before the vote, Dayton made no predictions on the stadium proposal's chances of reaching his desk.
"The coin is flipping in the air and I don't know whether it is going to come down heads or tails," he said.
Some Republicans have said they envision a scenario in which Dayton might trade his approval of education and government reform provisions he has spoken against in exchange for their support for a stadium.
"No one has approached me with any of those suggestions or offers," Dayton said. "I have heard the rumors, but nothing at this point has come to pass."
If you read Peter's post early today, you knew already that Baylor would likely be in the market for a new offensive coordinator due to the prospect of current (and longtime) QB coach and offensive coordinator Phillip Montgomery taking the head coaching job at Tulsa. After a few hours of waiting during which I assume the parties haggled a deal basically already done, the Tulsa World is reporting that he will indeed depart for our neighbors to the north. Thus ends a professional relationship nearly two decades in the making between Montgomery and Briles, who will now have to replace one of his most trusted assistants.
I don't want anyone to get me wrong on this-- I could not be happier for Phil Montgomery. He's been a huge part of Baylor's success the last few years, both as a mentor to Robert Griffin III, Nick Florence, and Bryce Petty and as a play-caller, a role he assumed three years ago. We will dearly miss his contributions to the team on and off the field, I'm sure. I'd be lying, however, if I said I wasn't somewhat intrigued by the prospect of Briles making a new hire on the offensive side, something we've only seen him do once (when Dino Babers left for Eastern Illinois*) in the last few years.
*When this happened, Kendal Briles went from RBs to WRs and Jeff Lebby from a GA role to RBs, in case you were curious.
As to the former, though we can't know for sure where Briles will look to fill our new vacancy, we can probably make a few educated suppositions. First, it seems likely to the point of assumption that Randy Clements (OL and running game coordinator) or Kendal Briles (WRs, passing game coordinator, and recruiting coordinator) will be elevated to the nominal role of OC, maybe even both since co- style arrangements are all the rage these days. If it's Clements, I'd expect that he remains as the OL coach given his success there and we just hire a new QB coach, possibly from the high school or former player ranks. If it's Briles (or they decide that OC/Recruiting/WR is too much), you may see them bring in someone else to work with the WRs again (maybe a GA already on staff that caught an auspicious pass in our history against a bitter rival?). If that's the choice, you might see Briles work more directly with QBs again. No matter what, how Baylor handles this will be something to watch. As I've said several places, now might be exactly the right time to bring in some new blood from the high school ranks, both to help to recruit and keep our offense moving in the right direction.
Something else to consider that may throw a wrench into all this is who Montgomery takes with him to Tulsa. I'd be shocked if either Clements or KB goes simply because of their connections to Briles and potential roles in Montgomery's absence, but it's possible. Much more likely, I think, is that graduate assistants could find higher roles in the Montgomery regime in Tulsa, so we might have some replacing to do there. Montgomery will also need a defensive staff, as well, so we might see some movement there. I don't want to speculate too much without knowing basically anything at all, so I won't.
The bottom line for all this is that with Baylor's success, rising assistants leaving was basically inevitable. In fact, it's a borderline miracle and testament to the atmosphere Briles has created within his staff that we haven't seen more to date. Now we get to see how the Big 12 Champion Baylor Bears respond to a little potential adversity, and how our head coach fills a staff with a Montgomery-sized hole at OC.
UPDATE: Tulsa has confirmed.
UPDATE #2: Since a lot of people have asked-- no, I do not expect Montgomery to coach the bowl game. He's got a coaching staff to build and recruiting to do with about 7-8 weeks left before National Signing Day.
Good luck, Coach Montgomery! Thank you for everything!
Truck Yeah The trucks are good!
Toyota is going to dismantle and study this 2007 Tundra pickup truck, which single-owner Victor Sheppard put over a million miles on in less than a decade. It's still standing strong with the original engine, transmission and paint job.
Sheppard just swapped the truck out for a new one at a dealership near New Orleans. Apparently the 2016 Tundra he has now is the 16th Tundra he's owned in his lifetime. Big fan of the brand!
The 2007 Tundra was the first of the second generation body style the truck is still rocking today, and the first Tundra to be entirely built at Toyota's factory in San Antonio, Texas. The Tundra nameplate first showed up in 2000 and is still in my opinion one of the most underrated rigs on the road.
Toyota says the million-mile truck, which has the V8 engine*, has survived this long with no extraordinary maintenance outside “timing belt replacements, oil changes, and the manufacturer's regularly scheduled check-ups,” in a press release.
(*Correction: the dealership originally told me this truck had a 4.7 V8, but Toyota then informed me it was actually a 4.0 V6 truck. Later, a video of what's under the hood confirmed it was in fact a V8 all along.)

Though obviously every fluid, and the tires, would have to have been changed more than a few times over the truck's busy lifetime.
Other Toyotas have also become famous hitting hilariously high mileages and refusing to die.

“My truck looks great, and, except for a few little dents, it's almost like new,” said Sheppard. “Even the seats look just as they were when I bought it. They're not as clean, of course, but they're not busted or worn out.”
This man racked up more than 100,000 miles a year by “regularly driving long-haul trips from his home (presumably in Louisiana) to North Dakota, Wyoming, and Virginia” for his job.

And here I thought my old Tundra was long in the tooth at 300,000 miles.
Hopefully Toyota will make some videos about this well-used Tundra they're taking delivery of. I'd love to see what the inside of the engine looks like after that much real-world wear.
For those of you forced to do boring things in your life like work or take care of your children, a quick summary: Asymmetric Production's free, browser-based MMORPG-spoof-that's-actually-more-involved-than-most-MMORPGs Kingdom of Loathing has blown up from a dinky little comedy game riffing on nerd properties into a hefty nerd property of its own. In typical role-playing fashion, this game casts you as an adventurer in the titular magical land who must battle against the Naughty Sorceress and an awful lot of horrible, horrible puns. As you may expect, the quirk factor is high: the in-game currency is “meat” and the reference-heavy humor ranges from jokes about Scott Bakula to a secret area that riffs on Gothic and Romantic literature. The primary joke is that the game only appears to be simple. Most of the characters are stick figures and the palette uses maybe five colors total, but there's enough combat, status effects, character classes, skill sets and environments to explore that it may, in its own way, actually match a puny production like Skyrim in its complexity. Surpass even, since KoL is a) constantly introducing new content, and b) never really ends, as players can (and often do) replay the main quest again and again in hardcore runs in order to earn various rewards.
Which leads us (kind of) to the familiars. These are special companion creatures you can have with you to help during the game and they range from useless to almost unnecessarily awesome and often come with their own rules and equipment. They are acquired by putting “hatchling” items in the Terrarium at your campsite, and can usually only be used one at a time. Many of them are expensive and can only be bought with a certain in-game accessory (that requires actual money). While certain companions are required for specific situations, any committed quester will rack up as many as they can get their grubby low-res mitts on. Some do many things, some only do one thing really well, some do nothing, and some actually hurt you or impede your progress. Many of the more popular/well-known familiars are relatively easy to make/come by: the Levitating Potato, the various Gravy Fairies, the Cocoabo, the Grue and the iconic Sabre-Toothed Lime. Classics all! The following familiars, however, are among the most well-rounded you can hope to pick up. By no means are they the funniest, though. Special thanks to the KoL Wiki for all the (tiny, tiny) images.
10) MagiMechTech MicroMechaMech
Looking for something to help out in a fight? If you're just playing the game to have fun and adventure around (as opposed to the serious runners trying to play through over and over as fast as they can) then you can't go wrong with this simple but effective combat assistant. The MMt MMM is guaranteed to attack every turn, whether it be a weak or strong one, and deals out occasional hot elemental damage with its laser (for n00bzors the elements of Loathing are Hot, Cold, Spooky, Stench and Sleaze. Yes, Sleaze is an element). Even better, it can be constructed out of relatively common tinker parts that shouldn't take you an absurd amount of turns/battles to collect. Which is much more than I can say for some of the entries of this list. I mean, not to give it away or anything…
9) Slimeling
Venturing in the dreaded Slime Tube of your clan's basement will eventually lead you face to disgusting gelatinous face with the hideous Mother Slime. Beating her may net you a slimeling larva, which will bulk up into one of these after a quick trip to the terrarium. Once grown, it'll convert enemy hp into your mp–a handy trick done by many familiars–but the really interesting stuff happens when you feed it, which you need to do in order to “charge it” and get it ready for battle. If you give it meat stacks, it will regurgitate acidic “slime stacks” you can use to deal corrosive damage in combat. What's more, there's a chance it'll cough up equipment from other enemies–think of it as stealing from them. So I wouldn't count on him specifically for freeing up inventory space, but if you'd like to do something constructive with your trash, why not convert it into toxic weaponry? What else were you going to do with it? Recycle? Ha! Take that, Al Gore!
8) Rock Lobster
To count the number of characters, adventures and items in this game inspired by song titles would take about as long as most people seem to take to play it, which is to say a lifetime. Aside from that, a lobster covered in magical rocks doesn't sound particularly helpful, but you'll be surprised at the amount of perks there are keeping one around. This B-52's-inspired crustacean will once again convert your opponent's hp to your mp, and can breathe underwater. Sometimes it'll deal hot damage, too, which is a little weird but welcome anyway. There's also the rare chance that it'll drop “floaty sand”; this can be used to pep up your initiative and your moxie for ten adventures. For everything it does, it's relatively simple to make, although unfortunately this is a case where the once-common items needed to construct it can be somewhat difficult to find nowadays.
7) Tickle-Me-Emilio
Would you buy an action figure of Emilio Estevez? If so, would you then tickle it, especially if it was wearing a leather jacket and quoting Young Guns all the time? Described as “the youngest of guns”, this sentient doll does a whole mess of functions during combat, much like other familiars. What sets him apart is the nature of his status messages, all of which make up a veritable Festevez of references (his hp/mp-restoring speech is his inspirational Mighty Ducks monologue). Unfortunately this was another limited-offer deal, obtainable only through the limited-appearance area Crimbo Town, but that doesn't mean you can't still get ahold of one if you're willing to shell out the meat. How much meat is Emilio worth to you? I hope that's the first time you've pondered that question…
6) Mini-Hipster
Anyone familiar (ha!) with the politics of Loathing will know of the constant struggle between Orcish Frat Boys and Hippies on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. It's not entirely clear where hipsters fit into this equation, exactly, but having one on your side gives you a wealth of advantages larger than Kimya Dawson's hair, including restoring hp/mp and stat increases. It's true that making hipster jokes is like shooting fish in a barrel made entirely out of guns but it's hard not to crack a smile at the description of the item this particular familiar hatches out of (“This is a fairly large can of beer with a big blue ribbon painted on the side. It definitely didn't win the first prize in any competition having to do with beer”). The downside is that if you travel with him you'll probably have to fight a special enemy, usually a not-at-all-veiled Scott Pilgrim reference (especially if you have your guy equipped with a chiptune guitar or fixed-gear bicycle). The thing is, the Mini-Hipster is probably a boring, terrible person at heart, but you adore him anyway, because he has huge eyes.
5) Rogue Program
Another parody, this one of both Tron and the infamous Tron Guy Jay Maynard, and he even comes with a cute little lightcycle. There's a real incentive to having him around, and that's his occasional drop of tokens for the Game Grid, which allow you to access the arcade located on The Wrong Side of the Tracks. Like much of the others on this list, this familiar spawned from an item of the month, available only by trading in a “Mr. Accessory” obtainable by paying actual money. I tried not to put too many of that kind of familiar on here, since that sort of thing adds up pretty fast, but the Rogue Program combines the best elements of two different other familiars: he can once again convert enemy hp into mp for you and decrease enemy accuracy. He can also attack and block simultaneously, making him surprisingly versatile for a one-note joke. Is it all worth ten real world dollars? You'll have to ask someone who bought it when they had the chance.
4) El Vibrato Megadrone
If you're lucky and industrious enough to build a Shimmering Portal from your campsite to the fantastical El Vibrato Island, you might be able to eventually convince the local constructs to assemble this otherworldly programmable buddy for you. What's neat about the Megadrone is that it, like the other Vibratos, receives commands via punchcards (the easiest way to defeat enemy constructs is by commanding them to attack walls and floors). So unlike most multiple-use familiars, you can actually control what this one will do in combat by giving it the right commands. Depending on the active cards, you can have it attack, defend, heal you, enhance your attacks and de-enhance your enemy. Sounds good to me. Just make sure you don't get your cards confused…
3) Knob Goblin Organ Grinder
Very few of the familiars are simple in concept, often combining two or three different crazy ideas. Not that you need to know that to appreciate them, of course, but it helps, and this guy is a great example. In this case, “organ grinder” is to be taken literally: in addition to increasing meat drops from your enemies, he will fight for you in combat and grind your foes into meat pies, each of which have different status effects depending on who you fight. If you have him around for a successful boss battle he might crank you out a “badass pie”, which gives you tons of extra adventures and some great buffs. He also speaks in Cockney rhyming slang, which I guess is supposed to compliment the whole Sweeney Todd vibe but really just comes across as random. Which is to say, totally normal for this game. You're better off just eating his pies and not trying to figure out what he's saying, especially when he starts talking about his “Jacksons.”
2) Green Pixie
This ferocious little bastard will serve you well in combat and get you a whole bunch of meat, but the real reason for putting up with his nigh-incomprehensible status messages are his item drops: sometimes in battle he'll produce a tiny bottle of absinthe. All booze is vital to being a KoL player, and drinking this particular spirit will give you a special status effect called “Absinthe Minded” that allows you to adventure in a secret area of the Spooky Forest known as the Worm Wood. An alcoholic lit-major's dream, you'll find scores of in-jokes there, including probably the only videogame enemies based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge poems ever. Probably. Beyond the novelty factor, there are also extremely valuable items and pieces of equipment to be found and the battles are great for leveling up quickly. Certain Worm Wood adventures will give you permanent stat gains, too, which is just icing on the boozy, hallucinogenic cake. The best part, though, is that this verdant bugger'll toss you absinthe five times a day, so you'll always be able to go back, or make a fortune selling it to poor schmucks who can't.
1) Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot
Given its reputation, I couldn't put this ridiculous hybrid specimen at number one. There are a few familiars that require an epic amount of effort to achieve, and sometimes they're not entirely worth it, depending on your goals. The Misshapen Animal Skeleton, for example, is great in combat but can only be constructed after collecting an ungodly amount of dusty animal bones. This thing, on the other hand, is like a bizarro Swiss army knife of a companion. You definitely have to work to assemble the NPZR, and finding/constructing every piece of the body will likely take up most of your time and adventures (not to mention meat: the zombie pineal gland alone can only be bought from the in-game mall these days and can set you back quite a bit). But it can heal, attack, give meat, and make you toast (seriously). What's not to love about that? When it was first introduced its origins were made mysterious, though even having the instructions public doesn't make it any easier to construct. What's even better is that its wide range of skills appeals to all levels of players: “softcore” first-timers can use it for its combat prowess while level-runners can take advantage of its meat farming abilities. True, there are other familiars that outclass it, but at least it won't cost you a Mr. Accessory for those of you lacking in real-world funds. Plus, it's sort of a distillation of the appeal of the series: if you're not at least little excited about having a ninja zombie pirate robot by your side, you're probably better off just playing something else. And I'm pretty sure it's the only familiar that has its own original dance.
Well, this is embarrassing. Looks like Disney has made an expensive mistake during the launch of its new Avatar theme park, and now it is in full-on damage-control mode. The company just issued an official apology for putting a statue of Hugo Weaving in its Avatar theme park because it had a vague memory of him being in the movie.
Yikes. Looks like Disney's newest park is off to a rocky start.
Disney first became aware of the mix-up this week after astute fans pointed out that Weaving—whose 15-foot-tall bronze likeness greets visitors near the Avatar park's entrance—did not actually appear anywhere in the film's 162 minutes of running time.

“We at Disney apologize to fans of Avatar, as well as Hugo Weaving for this regrettable mistake. But, seriously, we could've sworn Hugo Weaving was in that movie,” read an official statement from Disney. “Early on, when we were planning some of the park's statues, Hugo Weaving's name came up, and nobody really questioned it. Avatar just seemed like the kind of movie he would be in, you know?”
“But no. We IMDB'd it, and it turns out Hugo Weaving was not in Avatar after all,” Disney's statement continued. “Wonder who we were thinking of. Giovanni Ribisi maybe?”
The statement went on to describe how Disney had originally commissioned the statue of the Matrix star for the Avatar park because they were all pretty sure they remembered him appearing in the film somewhere, like as the chief or one of the military guys. Or if not that, maybe he was the tree. Like the tree's voice or something. To its memory, he was definitely involved somehow. Disney officials reiterated that they were sincerely sorry for this major error, but that it was honestly kind of freaking them out to learn that Hugo Weaving was not in Avatar because they really thought they remembered him being in it.

For the moment, park officials are scrambling to make things right. The statue has been removed from its prominent place near the main entrance, and the site will remain empty while they confirm if Giovanni Ribisi was, in fact, who they were thinking of. At this point, they don't super trust their memory, so they just want to make extra sure.
Wow, it looks like Disney has a real mess on its hands. Hopefully they can get it all sorted out ASAP so Avatar fans can enjoy the awesome park they were promised.
Story highlights Nazih al-Ruqaii, aka Abu Anas al Libi, has died at a hospital, family says
Libyan native was snatched in Tripoli by U.S. forces in October 2013
Authorities say he played role in bombings at American embassies in 1998
(CNN) Abu Anas al Libi, an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa who was captured by U.S. special forces in Libya, has died in a U.S. hospital, his son said Saturday.
Abdel Mouin told CNN by phone from Tripoli that the family was notified by his lawyer in the United States that al Libi, whose real name was Nazih al-Ruqaii, died in a hospital Friday evening.
JUST WATCHED Al Qaeda suspect faced trial in U.S. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Al Qaeda suspect faced trial in U.S. 01:49
The 50-year-old native of Libya was accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania . The two bombings killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured thousands more.
A document filed in court Saturday by the Department of Justice said al Libi died after his already poor health suddenly worsened.
On Wednesday, the letter filed with the judge presiding over the trial said, he "was taken from the Metropolitan Correctional Center to a New York hospital due to sudden complications arising out of his long-standing medical problems."
Women seeking abortions in Florida will be required to make two visits to a clinic, with a mandatory 24-hour waiting period in between, to end a pregnancy under a bill signed into law on Wednesday.
Republican Governor Rick Scott signed the measure, passed this spring by the Republican-controlled state legislature, without comment.
“This means women will be empowered to make fully informed decisions,” said Republican state Representative Jennifer Sullivan, who sponsored the legislation. “It's just common courtesy to have a face-to-face conversation with your doctor about such an important decision — especially for such an irreversible procedure as an abortion.”
Opponents said it would unnecessarily burden women by creating a stressful waiting period and additional expense.
The bill was amended to let doctors waive the waiting period in cases of rape, incest, domestic violence or human trafficking.
The push for more restrictive waiting periods comes amid a wave of anti-abortion laws passed by a number of states in recent years as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion [ID: nL1N0XZ1TM].
When Florida's law takes effect on July 1, 28 states will require a waiting period for an abortion, with several states requiring waits as long as 72 hours, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive policy.
Currently, 11 states require women to make two clinic visits for an abortion, the institute added. With restrictions passed by Florida and other states this year, the count will soon rise to 14.
Michelle Richardson, director of public policy for the ACLU of Florida, said her organization was considering a legal challenge to the new Florida law.
“With this dangerous law, Florida is joining other states in the race to the bottom for limiting women's ability to make their own personal healthcare decisions,” she said. “Not only is the 24-hour mandatory delay medically unnecessary, it could in fact interfere with a woman's health.”
The state legislature approved the bill in late April, with most Republicans voting for it and most Democrats opposed.
State law already required an “informed consent” briefing to tell women the state of gestation and the possible side effects of abortion, but that talk could be delivered immediately before the procedure.

A jovial Al Jefferson wasn't talking about his future with the Jazz on Thursday  if there is one.Utah's leading scorer this season, Jefferson becomes an unrestricted free agent on July 1. One of management's major decisions during what will likely be a hectic off-season will be whether to try and bring Jefferson back to Utah. He will undoubtedly get big-money offers from other teams.For now, however, Jefferson isn't discussing his contract situation."We'll cross that bridge when I get there," he said.Asked if he's talked to management about what needs to be done to make the Jazz a playoff team and legitimate contender, Jefferson laughed."That's something that we talked about," Jefferson said. "[But] it's secret. We don't discuss the business [with the media], you know? But I feel real good about it."Jefferson, 28, just finished his ninth season in the NBA. He has spent the last three years in Utah, where he claims to have grown as a player and a person.Asked to explain, Jefferson said, "I can't put it into too many words. Just the outlook on everything. Just about being a professional. Not only being professional on the court but being professional off the court, too. We're all grown men, so they're not going to hold your hand to make sure you're doing the right things. You have to take care of your body. You have to be ready to play. That's where you have to come in."  Steve Luhm

Foreclosure Crisis How Banks and Government Fail Homeowners
As the sixth year of the foreclosure crisis comes to an end, the percentage of loans in foreclosure remains a staggering eight times higher than it was in 2005. About 5.3 million homeowners — about 11 percent of all borrowers — are behind on their payments.
But 2012 was also the year that home prices hit a bottom and have started to very slowly climb. The number of new homeowners falling behind on their payments has dropped substantially since the peak. The government also took a dramatic step: a $25 billion settlement with the five biggest mortgage servicers.
Earlier this year, ProPublica focused on one homeowner — Sheila Ramos, who lost her home in Florida and ended up living in a tent in Hawaii — to pull together all the threads of the crisis and give readers a single story that explains the causes of the crisis, the bumbling response by the big banks and Washington, and the human toll exacted by the whole debacle. It is also available as a Kindle Single, which includes extra material.
We've also been keeping a close watch on whether the government is keeping its promises about compensating victims of the crisis.
The largest program is a review overseen by federal regulators covering more than 4 million loans. It launched back in 2011, but as of mid-December, no homeowner had received any compensation. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency spokesman Bryan Hubbard said regulators had been "working toward beginning compensation for a limited number of people [this month] with reviews and remediation continuing through 2013."
The program — called the Independent Foreclosure Review — has been beset with questions about its fairness, transparency and integrity since it launched. At least partly due to those problems, many borrowers aren't even bothering to apply for compensation. As of November, only 315,000 borrowers have sent in forms requesting to be reviewed, according to the OCC's Hubbard, about seven percent of people eligible to apply. The final deadline to apply is at the end of this month.
Federal regulators designed the program to work like this: Each of the banks would hire an "independent consultant" (approved by the regulator) to conduct reviews of the bank's foreclosure cases. The bank was supposed to foot the bill, but the consultant, not the bank, was supposed to decide which of the bank's customers deserved compensation and how much.
But ProPublica has revealed evidence that the banks themselves are heavily involved in the reviews, calling their independence and integrity into question. After our story about Bank of America's involvement in its review, the bank and its consultant changed their review process. Bank of America also engineered a de facto appeals process; if the consultant decided a BofA customer deserved compensation, the bank could provide more information that it wasn't at fault. Borrowers have no such ability to appeal.
To lead its role in the review, JPMorgan Chase installed an executive named by the Justice Department for allegedly facilitating a scheme to defraud Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. She declined to comment for our story.
In a telling irony, it seems likely the review will end up steering far more money toward the consulting companies hired by the banks than will go to harmed homeowners.
Finally, some banks have been shockingly slow to begin their reviews. Regulators have ordered Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to conduct reviews of their former mortgage servicing subsidiaries, for instance, but they still haven't begun. The process covers loans that were in foreclosure in 2009 or 2010, but the review won't get going until at least 2013. That seems likely to further deter harmed borrowers from applying for compensation.
A Federal Reserve spokesperson said a company, Navigant Consulting, had been selected to conduct the review for both servicers, but the contracts had not been finalized. It's unclear when the review would begin.
The government's other big reaction to the foreclosure crisis, the National Mortgage Settlement, has also had its disappointments. The deal involved 49 states, the federal government, and the five largest mortgage servicers. The headline number was $25 billion, but only $5 billion of that is actually cash that the big banks would pay out. The other $20 billion is composed of "credits," awarded when the banks take steps to avoid foreclosures, for instance by offering loan modifications that cut the amount homeowners owe.
Of the cash, half — $2.5 billion — was to go to states to address the foreclosure crisis. But as we've reported, almost $1 billion of that is actually being used to patch state's ailing budgets. (See our state-by-state breakdown here.)
$1.5 billion will be sent to borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure, with each borrower receiving only about $1,000-$2,000. That process has finally gotten underway, and the deadline for borrowers to make a claim to receive that payment is early next year. (See more info about this in our FAQ.)
As for the $20 billion in credits, the banks appear to be in the process of fulfilling those obligations, but there are plenty of questions about how much good it's doing. Some credits are for actions banks were taking already (like demolishing abandoned homes). And although government officials touted the agreement as a way to boost the number of modifications that reduced borrowers' debts, much of the banks' activity hasn't focused on keeping borrowers in their homes. Rather, the number of short sales — an agreement by the bank to sell the home for less than the amount owed — has been far higher.
As the foreclosure crisis and the government's sputtering response enter their seventh year, ProPublica will be keeping watch.
F. Scott Fitzgerald Made $8,397 On Great Gatsby; His Daughter Gets $500,000 Per Year From It
from the just-as-Jefferson-intended? dept
Royalties from The Great Gatsby totaled only $8,397 during Fitzgerald's lifetime. Today Gatsby is read in nearly every high school and college and regularly produces $500,000 a year in [F. Scott Fitzgerald's daughter] Scottie's trust for her children.
There have been an increasing number of questions raised about both the length of copyright and the fact that it passes on to heirs after the original creator passes on. The original purpose of copyright had nothing to do with creating a welfare system for the children of content creators, no matter how much some content creators would like it to work that way. Economist Greg Mankiw points out a "factoid" that drives home the oddity that comes from such long copyrights:The article this comes from goes into great detail into F. Scott Fitzgelald's earnings over his lifetime, and what's striking is that with a different sort of copyright system in place, he barely seems to rely on copyright royalties at all to make money. Instead -- like most jobs -- he recognizes he needs to keep producing new works to earn money, selling stories to various publications, along with working for Hollywood studios in addition to his novels. How many things have changed.

There are several different techniques for creating stencils with Adobe Photoshop. In this tutorial we will look at using Threshold to make stencils.
Part B of this tutorial explains how you can then print your own original t-shirts with your stencil art. I couldn't even begin to explain how addictive printing t-shirts becomes!
Threshold Method
First you are going to need a picture idea for your stencil. A great place to find photos is stock.xchng or just Google Image Search it. I'm going to use a picture of Deborah Harry (Blondie) for a retro stencil.
Now duplicate the layer. Just click the layer called “Background” and drag it to this icon at the bottom of the layer palette to duplicate the layer.
Click on this icon at the bottom of your “Layer” window and select Solid Colour…
Select a bright colour in the Colour Picker dialogue box that is going to stand out against your image. Click OK. See image below.
Drag your new fill layer inbetween the two other layers. Your Layer Pallete should look like the image below.
Now working on the top layer “Background Copy” we want to remove all the unwanted bits. In my case I want to isolate Blondie and get rid of the background blue. To do this you should use the pen tool but if you are feeling lazy just use the magic wand and eraser tool.
Desaturate the top layer. Shft + Ctrl + U
Adjust the threshold. Image >> Adjustments >> Threshold.
Move the slider until you get a good result and click OK. The image below is what I used but this will differ for each picture.
The resulting image maybe a little jagged (pixelated) but don't worry we will fix that.
Next a Gaussian Blur with a radius of around about 1. Filter >> Blur >> Gaussian Blur…
Now it will be blurry so we need to adjust the curves. Image >> Adjustments >> Curves…
The line in the “Curves” dialogue box will appear as a diagonal. Click on this diagonal line twice and drag these two markers until your line forms an “S” shape (as shown below). The lower marker will increase the black values as you pull it down. The upper marker will decrease the grey values as you pull it up. The exact shape of YOUR “S” curve will depend on YOUR picture, so watch your image as you move these markers until you achieve the desired result.
Your image should be looking clean now. In your Layers Palette double-click on the Layer Thumbnail (as shown below) and change the color to black or white depending on your picture.
I found that black worked best for my image.
Finally take your paint brush tool! THIS NEXT STEP IS WHAT MAKES IT A FUNCTIONING STENCIL!!
The white areas are the areas I'm going to cut out, so I need to make sure that no black areas are enclosed by the white.
The image below demonstrates the idea of creating bridges so that there are no islands. You can see on picture 1 that if I cut out the white region I would lose the wheel. In picture 2 you can see the bridges which stops the loss of the wheel detail.
Bridges also make your stencil stronger. If you have large areas to cut out you might want to consider adding bridges to maintain the strength of the stencil. You may also want to paint out areas to simplify your stencil.
Below shows my finished stencil art of Blondie. You can see that I increased the Canvas Size and painted in her missing elbow. I also used my artistic licence and simplified the hair into some spikey bits.
Then true to form, I couldn't just stop there and had to add in some text…
So that's the basics of creating a stencil using Threshold. Have fun!

“It's gonna be back in the next three months!” swore Nouriel Roubini, the celebrity economist known as Dr. Doom, about the infamous party Jacuzzi he'd been forced to remove from the roof of his East Village loft by the Department of Buildings — a city tiff that had made the tabloids just hours earlier. “I'm getting all the permits,” he said.
Roubini, dressed in a billowy white shirt and surrounded by a group of leggy women, had lent his apartment for the night to the mayoral campaign of Jack Hidary, a dot-com millionaire who is running as an independent. Upstairs on the open-air deck, partygoers were lamenting the loss of Roubini's hot tub, which had been covered over with plywood. But downstairs, amid a hundred-strong throng of onlookers, Hidary — who sits on the advisory council of Google X Labs and has been involved with a number of start-ups in the city since making his fortune with early job site Earthweb — was laying out his plan to make New York a city of forward-thinking entrepreneurs.
“When I'm mayor, everyone gets a pair of Google Glasses!” he said to loud applause.
Hidary's mayoral campaign has been seen as a minor threat to front-runners Christine Quinn, Bill de Blasio, and Anthony Weiner, all of whom have more political experience and bigger ties to the city's power brokers. But as the race has taken its latest twists — with De Blasio, the most liberal candidate in the race, holding a commanding lead in the primary polls — Hidary hopes he can position himself as a viable alternative.
“I need 400,000 votes,” Hidary said. “That's what wins mayor of New York City.”
Hidary told the crowd that he plans to roll out most of his campaign outreach after the primaries, given the amount of “noise in the system” at present. His campaign — which is heavy on entrepreneurship and oriented at bringing the outer boroughs up to speed in the start-up economy — is also focused on attracting more giants to the city.
“We want 100 more Googles — companies from Europe, Asia — opening up offices, opening up jobs in New York City,” he said.
It's a Bloombergian pitch — making New York, and specifically Manhattan, the center of innovation — and indeed, Hidary has brought on a number of Bloomberg campaign vets to his campaign. But while he's the second-richest candidate in the race (after grocery billionaire John Catsimatidis), Hidary doesn't have Bloomberg money. He's poured $1 million of his own funds into the race, but he also implored Roubini's friends to give what they could.
“The one thing I want to tell you right now is that I am running for mayor of New York City, and I am running to win,” Hidary told the crowd. “This is not a campaign just to raise some ideas. This is a campaign very serious about winning.”
In an interview on Roubini's deck, as well-dressed guests swirled around him, Hidary called De Blasio's emergence as Democratic front-runner “great for us” — and he's not wrong. A general election pitting cantankerous former MTA chief Joe Lhota against a tax-the-rich progressive would, in fact, create an opening for a business-minded centrist in the Bloomberg mold. As Bloomberg News reported today, the city's moneyed class is upset about De Blasio's calls for higher taxes on upper-income earners, and business elites who aren't ready to join hands with Lhota might find Hidary an acceptable alternative. If he can convince the city's hot-tubbing set that he'll keep their fortunes intact, Hidary might find himself with many more friends in high places.

Scholarships for transgender students are not uncommon, but Oceanside-based MiraCosta College is claiming to be the first college in America to fund such a project.
Support Times of San Diego's growth
with a small monthly contribution Become a supporter
Called the Trans* Pride Scholarship, the endowment aims to provide a $1,000 grant every year.
“While members of the LGBT community experience marginalization, this marginalization is experienced most greatly by members of the transgender and gender nonconforming communities,” said Steven Deineh, co-adviser of the school's Gender Sexuality Alliance Faculty.
“Scholarships and visible support for members of this at-risk community are critical right now as states like Indiana and North Carolina and highly visible government officials are disavowing the civil rights of transgender people under the auspices of religious freedom.”
Fundraising for the Trans* Pride Scholarship began in 2015 — a year after the college's Gay Straight Alliance awarded its first $1,000 grant to student Geoffrey Koch.
Trans* Pride was created by a group of faculty, staff and students “concerned with traditional and historic barriers to higher education for transgender and gender nonconforming students,” the school said.
The scholarship will go to a “transgender or gender nonconforming student or active ally to this community,” said a news release.
Faculty, staff, students, members of the MiraCosta College Board of Trustees and community supporters gave to the scholarship endowment, the school said. The Gender Sexuality Alliance student club led a majority of the fundraising efforts with events such as the 6th Annual Queer Cupcake Party and 3rd Annual Royal Drag Show.
“Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression is welcome to attend — or work for — MiraCosta College,” Deineh said.
Potential donors or anyone with questions can call 760-795-6777 or visit this website.
UC San Diego and San Diego State University also have potential transgender scholarships but as part of an LGBTQ outreach. So does the University of San Diego School of Law.

NEW YORK - And just like that, LeBron James has declared the Cavaliers fit to reach and win The Finals.
"I feel like we're ready to make a championship run," James said Saturday morning, ahead of Cleveland's shootaround at Madison Square Garden in preparation to play the Knicks. "I'm confident in this team and I know we can make a championship run, and that's all you can ask for."
On the one hand, no one should expect James to say anything less. The Cavs are in first place in the East, are likely to surpass last season's 53 wins, and James has already reached five consecutive Finals.
On paper, this Cleveland team is stronger than the one James took to the championship round a year ago. James made the same kind of statement in February of 2015 about that team, and the Cavs won two games against Golden State in the Finals without Kyrie Irving or Kevin Love.
So, of course he's feeling good.
On the other hand, of course, are James' cryptic statements and on Twitter and generally strange behavior which raised questions about his commitment to and belief in the organization. His behavior prompted separate talks from coach Tyronn Lue and general manager David Griffin. A general malaise also occasionally grips this team on nights such as Thursday, when the Cavs were beaten by one of the NBA's worst teams in Brooklyn.
Cavs leadership addressed LeBron's behavior
Plus, the Warriors could become the best regular-season NBA team in history, and the Spurs, second-best in the West, are a full 10 games better than Cleveland.
"I haven't really thought about last year," James said. "I think it's not factual to think about what happened last year. My concern, I don't like to use the word concern because then everybody thinks it's like a problem. My only thought now and my preparation is getting these guys prepared to make a long run in the postseason.
"And obviously we've got 10 games left and I'm not going to shortcut that because we still can get better, but my whole mindset is getting these guys ready for the long run. I think we have enough, no I know we have enough and we just got to go out and do it."
James even took to Twitter - yes, Twitter! - Friday night to express a similar sentiment. He said "no" when asked if there was some team dinner or meeting Friday night that prompted the Tweet.
Heading into Saturday's game, James is averaging nearly 30 points on 60-percent shooting this week.
"He makes my job a lot easier because of his competitiveness, the way he gets everyone else involved, the way he can score the basketball, the way he puts his will on the game," coach Tyronn Lue said. "When you have guys like that it makes your job a lot easier."
James and the Cavs play Carmelo Anthony and the Knicks - which carries the sidebar of James hoping to maybe one day play on the same team as Anthony, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Paul.
While the tremors from that comment - published Wednesday by The Bleacher Report - have died down a little, James at Madison Square Garden always draws eyeballs. He's averaging 28.6 points with 6.8 rebounds and 6.8 assists in 21 regular-season games here.
If James goes off tonight and scores at least 31, he would pass Dominique Wilkins (26,668 points) for 12th on the NBA's all-time scoring list.

If 7-year-old cancer patient Jack Hoffman captured the nation's hearts by running for a 69-yard touchdown in Nebraska's spring game, then the eBay hoaxster who spoiled a fundraiser for his charity sickened our stomachs.
Hoffman, who got his own Upper Deck trading card to commemorate the highlight of April's spring games, signed four of the cards and auctioned one on eBay, with plans to contribute the money to his eponymous pediatric cancer research foundation. The winning bid was for $6,100, but the person who placed it had no intention of paying.
“It's a pretty sore subject around here,” Prep 2 Pro Sports owner Mike Schnoor, who is selling the cards on behalf of the Team Jack Foundation, said in an interview with Beckett Media. “The guy who ended up winning said a guy logged into his account and bid on it as a joke. It goes from a great story to kind of sobering.”
Schnoor said he was looking into alternative ways to auction the card.

You might never look at pure breeds the same way again. Science of Dogs has collected a number of photos from the 1915 book, Breeds of All Nations, and compared the breeds to their modern-day descendants. The results are surprising, and in many cases, saddening, as a century of breeding for aesthetic qualities alone has instilled many of these breeds with endemic health problems and shorter lifespans.
The good folks over at Sploid have graciously spliced a number of the photos into startling before/after gifs, a few of which you can see here (text via Science of Dogs).
Take the modern boxer for example...
A shorter face means a host of problems. The modern Boxer not only has a shorter face but the muzzle is slightly upturned. The boxer – like all bracecyphalic dogs – has difficulty controlling its temperature in hot weather, the inability to shed heat places limits on physical performance. It also has one of the highest cancer rates.
...the Dachshund...
The Dachshund used to have functional legs and necks that made sense for their size. Backs and necks have gotten longer, chest jutted forward and legs have shrunk to such proportions that there is barely any clearance between the chest and floor. The dachschund has the highest risk of any breed for intervertebral disc disease which can result in paralysis; they are also prone to achondroplastic related pathologies, PRA and problems with their legs.
...or the English bulldog.
They suffer from almost every possible disease. A 2004 survey by the Kennel Club found that they die at the median age of 6.25 years (n=180). There really is no such thing as a healthy bulldog. The bulldog's monstrous proportions makes them virtually incapable of mating or birthing without medical intervention.

Mass Effect Andromeda launched back in March with mixed reception from critics and gamers alike. However, if you are one of those who is waiting to pick up the game at a discounted price then, you are in luck as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game are currently available for discounted price.
Amazon has listed Both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Mass Effect Andromeda at a discounted price of just $40 which is 33% less from its original price. The discounted version of Mass Effect Andromeda is the standard edition for both Xbox One and PS4.
In related news, there is a rumor circulating the internet that suggests that Bioware has put the Mass Effect franchise in ICE following the mixed reviews for the recently released Mass Effect Andromeda.
According to the report, the sources close to the company has revealed that Bioware Montreal, Mass Effect Andromeda's developer, has been turned into a support studio, however, this does not mean that there won't be another game in Mass Effect franchise but, the studio will let the series sit for a while rather than working on the next iteration immediately.
The report further suggests that last month a number of employees of Bioware Montreal were transferred to EA Motive to work on Star Wars Battlefront II. Those remaining will provide support to other Bioware titles including the upcoming new IP code-named Dylan, which is rumored to be revealed at E3 2017.
Mass Effect Andromeda is an action adventure game developed by Bioware for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
Ring is announcing a major new product today that ties together its existing security cameras, lights, and doorbells: a full home security system, meant to monitor the inside of your home.
The announcement comes at an interesting moment. Just two weeks ago, Nest — which makes its own line of home security cameras and a still-unreleased smart doorbell — announced that it was getting into the home security system market, unveiling a $499 package that included a keypad and enough sensors to monitor two doors or windows.
“I hate to compete on price.”
Now Ring is announcing its own product, called Ring Protect, and it's deeply undercutting Nest on price. The base unit costs only $199 and includes a single door / window sensor and a motion detector. Additional door / window sensors will sell for $20, and additional motion sensors will sell for $30. That means you could outfit 10 windows and five rooms for the price of just getting started with Nest's system.
Ring's subscription monitoring service is relatively cheap, too. You can choose not to pay, in which case, alerts will be sent straight to your phone. But for $100 a year, Ring will provide a monitoring service so that someone can call your home if an alarm goes off. Nest hasn't announced how much its subscription monitoring service will cost, but RIng's compares favorably to something like ADT, which at the cheapest costs over $450 per year.
What we don't know yet is whether Ring can do this kind of monitoring better (or at least as good as) other companies in this field. ADT and other security companies have been offering similar services for decades, without much innovation. Ring and Nest are now trying to upend the space, but they haven't changed the game all that much just yet.
Ring CEO and founder Jamie Siminoff seems to admit that to an extent, saying that this first product will help Ring build an increasingly smarter home security system down the road. “I hate to compete on price because I think price is a terrible way to differentiate yourself,” Siminoff says. “But in this particular category ... there are companies like ADT that has been just absolutely blasting their customers with high prices and [have] really been marketing companies, not true technology companies.”
The system is supposed to get new smart features over time
For now, Ring isn't offering much in the way of smart features. Its security system and sensors will work together with Ring's existing cameras to monitor your house, and they'll all be accessible through a single Ring app — but that's it. It's all still pretty much the same as an ADT system. In the future, Siminoff suggests that Ring will be able to do a lot more, because its sensors and cameras will know when you're at home and when you're away.
Siminoff didn't say what kind of features will be added over time, but he said that the additional data an in-home system provides is “part of the reason Ring is getting into this.” Whatever Ring is working on seems to involve computer vision, which means the biggest upgrades will be for people who have Ring cameras installed. The security system also comes with a hub that supports low-energy smart home standards, which could allow Ring to release additional sensors over time.
Ring's start may be relatively simple, but it's beating Nest to market (Nest's option goes on sale in November), and seems to have already dramatically undercut the market leaders — on price, at least. This is ultimately a field where reliability is what matters most, and Ring will have to prove that it can handle being the core security system in people's homes. The Ring Protect system is available for preorder today and is supposed to launch later this month.
A winery owner in the Cowichan Valley says traffic delays on the Malahat Highway are squeezing her family's business.
Michelle Schulze, who co-owns Venturi-Schulze Vineyards in Cobble Hill, told All Points West host Jason D'Souza that a local tour operator will no longer bring tourists to the vineyard because the commute has become too long.
Construction on the winding highway from downtown Victoria has increased trip times from 45 minutes to as much as two hours in recent days, Schulze said.
Many tour participants are day-trippers from Seattle who arrive on the Victoria Clipper passenger ferry.
"They need to get back to the Clipper to get home," Schulze said.
"They're finding it really, really difficult to come all the way up and get back over in time to get people back where they need to be."
Venturi-Schulze Vineyards relies on summertime tours with out-of-town visitors for a significant part of their business, co-owner Michelle Schulze says. (Venturi-Schulze Vineyards)
Instead of languishing in Malahat lineups, Schulze said, the tour operator will take tourists to wineries closer to downtown Victoria, on the Saanich Peninsula.
The winery is a popular destination for local residents year round, but summertime is when tourists come from around the world, Schulze said.
"This is when we make most of our money," she said.
"Not only do they come up and spend money, but they order stuff online later and that's a big part of our business," she said. "If I start to miss out on that, I'm going to really start to feel it."
Increasing complaints
Sonia Furstenau, the Green Party MLA for the Cowichan Valley, said her office is receiving increasing numbers of complaints from constituents about construction slowdowns on the Malahat.
"We've heard people talking about two- to three-hour commutes," Furstenau told On the Island host Gregor Craigie.
One woman told the MLA's office she is thinking about quitting her job in Victoria because of the increased traffic delays.
"The impact it's having on drivers really does need to be addressed," Furstenau said.
A northbound stretch of the Malahat Highway has been reduced from two lanes to one during certain times, leading to long traffic lines. (@CeilidhMillar/Twitter)
Furstenau said she was told by NDP Transportation Minister Claire Trevena that the government is monitoring traffic volumes on the Malahat because it appears that construction might not be the only reason for the congestion.
It might be an unexpected consequence of the wildfires, she said, with more tourists remaining on the Island instead of heading for the B.C. Interior.
"In our letter we suggested some alternatives ... including changes to the times construction is happening," Furstenau said.
Traffic stoppages cancelled
The ministry of transportation assured commuters that the frustrating commute last Friday will not be repeated this week. Traffic stoppages of up to five minutes at a time were allowed last Friday, but those have now been eliminated.
However, Transportation Ministry director Janelle Erwin said shifting the roadwork to night time during the current phase of drilling and blasting is not possible, for safety reasons.
Not confident the ministries tweaks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/malahat?src=hash">#malahat</a> traffic flow will make any difference this weekend. I hope I am proven wrong! —@malahatdrive
In addition, a section of one northbound lane has remained closed to traffic even when road work is not in progress because it is being used as a staging area, Erwin said.
She said the potential for freeing up that lane for traffic is under discussion.
Meanwhile, the pain for commuters will not be over soon. The current roadwork is schedule to continue through the summer of 2018.

As defending champions at [flag country=”hr”] CounterPit, we are thrilled to announce that we will be going to Croatia to participate in the second season of the tournament. Last year we had an incredible lower bracket run to take the title after 2-0 against [flag country=”fr”] EnVyUs in the Grand Final, but this time around there will be no such shenanigans.
In season 2, there are four invited teams and four qualified teams, which will play in a BO3 Single Elimination bracket. One loss and you are out. The bracket has been released and it looks like this:
Quarterfinals
Thursday March 17th
10:45 CET – [flag country=”pl”] Virtus.Pro vs. [flag country=”ua”] FlipSid3 Tactics
13:45 CET – [flag country=”ua”] Natus Vincere vs. [flag country=”au”] Immunity
16:45 CET – [flag country=”dk”] Astralis vs. [flag country=”se”] Torpedo Gaming
19:45 CET – [flag country=”fr”] EnVyUs vs. [flag country=”us”] NRG eSports
If we come through as winners against Torpedo Gaming, we will be facing the winner of EnVy vs. NRG in the semifinal.
The Swedes from Torpedo Gaming is a relatively unknown team in the wider community, but the Swedish squad, consisting of [flag country=”se”] atter, [flag country=”se”] darti, [flag country=”se”] decent, [flag country=”se”] downie and [flag country=”se”] Malle, have been making waves in the layer just beneath the top teams. In the qualification for CounterPit Season 2, the team took down [flag country=”de”] Alternate aTTaX, [flag country=”eu”] Orgless and [flag country=”fi”] allu‘s ENCE, while drawing with both [flag country=”pl”] Vexed and [flag country=”dk”] CPH Wolves.
The game will be played as the best of three, and will be played on Thursday the 17th at 16:45. We will be updating both our Facebook and Twitter with more exact times when we get closer to the event, as the current schedule is subject to change if the prior games are delayed.
An October Update
Hello again, and apologies for the lack of activity again. We have made some progress in regard to the art of this game, and today I'd like to share it with you guys.
Last time we set our focus to create sprites for characters that were missing previously in the demo that we released a while back,and this was where we showed off our progress on the swimming instructor Ms. K.
With progress essentially complete on this character, we have now moved our efforts to a character that will have less importance to the overall story but will still help make the game feel more complete, that being the “Librarian” character.
Despite currently not having a huge presence in the game, she was still quite a challenge to develop. Also, while I helped push deign ideas at the beginning, a huge credit has to be given to our sprite artist Jhzargo for helping develop this character. He deserves all the praise you can give him.
With this character almost being wrapped up and ready for a future release, we'll begin to shift focus on revamping other characters that either need complete redesigns or just need some tweaks.
However it will be a while before these changes come into future versions of the game, so please keep that in mind. If you have anything you would like to comment on regards to what was shown, please feel free to share any thoughts with us(preferably on our discord).
Hope to update you guys again soon.

Cats purr like a baby to manipulate humans
Cats have long been known to get what they want from their owner, and British researchers believe they have discovered how.
In a paper published today in the journal Current Biology, the researchers find that pet cats get human owners to feed them through an urgent cry they embed into their purr.
Lead author Dr Karen McComb, at the Centre for Mammal Vocal Communication Research at the University of Sussex, says parallels have previously been drawn between the cry of domestic cats and that of human babies.
"Our study indicates that such a cry, embedded within the naturally low-pitched purr, is dramatically emphasised by cats in the context of food solicitation and humans are highly sensitive to it," she says.
She also found the highest frequency that the embedded cry was measured at occurs at frequencies similar to those of a human infant's cry.
"The interesting thing here is that the cry is embedded in a vocalisation that we normally think of as pleasant, the purr," she says.
"So it sort of subliminally triggers a sense of urgency. We found men were as responsive to it as women, but then most men find it difficult to listen to baby cries I'd guess."
Less pleasant
For the study, the purrs of 10 cats were played back to 50 people, not all of whom were cat owners.
The participants consistently judged the purrs made when the cat was actively seeking food to be more urgent and less pleasant, says McComb.
When those purrs were manipulated to have the underlying cry removed, all participants found the calls less urgent.
But cat owners did identify the solicitation call more readily, indicating McComb believes that the "ability to identify these calls can be improved with learning".
The study also shows that the call is most commonly used in households where the cat has one-to-one contact with its owner.
"Cats will use whatever is most effective - and solicitation purring will be most effective when they have the owner's undivided attention - particularly when they have access to the bedroom in the mornings."
With the study inspired by her own cat "waking me in the morning with an insistent purr", McComb is not sure if the findings will translate to other domestic pets such as dogs and birds. But she is hoping to find out through further studies.
"I think most cat owners would agree that they like to have things their own way - and usually get it. More so than dogs I think, who are usually more subservient," she says.
Bill Cooper is one of the top American BJJ black belts; he is under Ricardo “Franjinha” Miller training with Team Paragon BJJ.
This DVD is primarily about escapes; the escapes that Bill teaches are shown with a transition to a dominant position or a submission of your own. He starts off stuck in a submission and proceeds to make his opponent pay for it. He explains every escape in full, twice. Each explanation would stand alone with enough detail for you to understand the move. At first this threw me off, I kept thinking he was going to show a different technique. After I caught on to this, it was nice because I would listen for little differences and pick up smaller details. After the double explanation, each move is shown with a few different angles.
This DVD is a nice break from most of the BJJ DVDs that I have because it focuses on defense. It seems like there are a lot of DVDs that show you submissions and sweeps, but the defense aspect is often lacking. For that reason alone I like having this DVD in my BJJ library.
What is on the DVD? Like the name says, Bill shows escapes and not the basic ones everyone has already seen. He is not showing the common mistakes that may have gotten you in this submission or bad position. He is not showing you how to play it safe and not make mistakes. He shows the techniques that he likes to use when he is in a bad spot. Most of the escapes end in a submission of your own, if not you will at least end up dominant.
He shows escapes for: Armbar X4, Triangle X3, Rear naked choke X2, Omo plata X1, Back X4, Crucifix X3, Body triangle X2, Leglock X5, Guillotine X1, Shaolin (Darce) X4. The DVD is 86 Min, with a little bonus footage of him on “Rolled up”.
The most common submission he shows after his escape is the Darce choke. If you like the Darce choke I am sure you will pick up a few new tips.
What I got out of it. I learned a lot of cool escapes that I have never seen before. I am still at the place where I am happy to break free from the submission. I would happily transition to an attack but that seems easier said than done. Also I did pick up some good details on finishing some submissions. The two techniques that I really liked the most are the “bigfoot” triangle escape and the “sewer escape” for the guillotine.
I would recommend this DVD. I would say this DVD is great for anyone blue belt and above. The escapes shown are not your basic and standard escapes. I think white belts are better off learning the basic escapes and adding these techniques later. There are also a few submissions that he assumes that you understand, again blue belt and above will be fine. The DVD is all no-gi, but most of the techniques will work for BJJ. If you get this DVD I recommend starting from some of these bad spots while rolling, that way you can be sure to work the new techniques into your game.

ANGLETON, Texas– It's baffling doctors and leaving a 12-year-old girl in a lot of pain. According to KRIV, Katelyn Thornley can't stop sneezing. She sneezes up to 12,000 times a day; that's about 20 times a minute.
Katelyn and her family spoke to KRIV and said it's so bad that Katelyn can't go to school. It started just a few weeks ago. “I just started in little spurts, sneezing…I'm constantly in pain with my abdomen; my legs are weak. I can barely eat,” Katelyn said.
The family has talked to six doctors, who have ruled out viruses and allergies. Some experts think it may be stress-related.
Katelyn told KRIV the only relief she gets is when she is able to fall asleep after taking Benadryl. “Sometimes I wish I could leave my body for a little while so I could watch myself sleep and be at peace because even in my dreams, I sneeze.”
Recently for work I've had the opportunity to upgrade a website from using version 4 of Umbraco to version 7. Due to the significant investment already made in the website, the upgrade needed to be able to reuse as much of the existing customisations and templates as possible. Fortunately version 7 still supports the older template format that used ASP.net master pages.
Upgrading an Umbraco website is composed of two main parts. Upgrading the umbraco database, and upgrading the website content itself.
Upgrading Database
Normally the database is upgraded the first time that the website is started after being upgraded. An administration screen is displayed on startup, prompting the user to log in and authorise the upgrade.
While this is practical for upgrades between minor versions, there can be larger database changes that prevent this being done in a single step, such as the changes to the authentication system in 7.3.X. To handle the database upgrade process, I suggest incrementally stepping through versions to perform the upgrade. An upgrade project can be done by creating an empty mvc website, then installing the desired umbraco version through nuget, and configuring it to use your database. In version 6 the database connection string is now stored as a connection string instead of as an app setting. The umbraco upgrade process will automatically migrate the connection string if found.
Where configuring the upgrade projects to perform the database upgrade, there are two settings that need to be customised:
Database connection string: For upgrading to Umbraco 6, the existing app setting can be copied across, but the Umbraco 7 upgrade will need it as a connection string.
umbracoConfigurationStatus app setting: This tells Umbraco what the current version of the database is.
For my upgrade, I stepped through the following versions:
6.2.4
7.3.1
7.5.15 (Initially went to 7.6.4, but had to go to an earlier version after discovering a bug with winforms templates).
Upgrading website
.Net and Nuget Packages
Moving from Umbraco 4 to 7 not only brings a number of API changes, but also raises the minimum supported version of .net to 4.5.2. When the .net version on a project is changed, nuget packages need to be reinstalled so that the correct versions of the assemblies is reference to by the project. By changing the .net version before upgrading the Umbraco libraries, most packages will be reinstalled with a newer version whe the Umbraco packages are updated.
For any other packages that weren't reinstalled as part of the upgrade, Visual Studio will provide a warning that they are targeting an old version of .net. Once identified, these can be reinstalled with the following command using the nuget console:
Update-Package <package_name> -ProjectName <project_name> -reinstall
Command Reference
API Changes
Umbraco startup now relies on global.asax inheriting from the UmbracoApplication class to correctly initialise Umbraco's application context and services. If you have no startup customisation, you can just change the class referenced in global.asax. If you have existing startup code that relies on Application_Start , it will need to be updated to use the protected override void OnApplicationStarted(object sender, EventArgs e) callback provided by UmbracoApplication, or else it will not be executed.
If you have made use of the uComponents plugin, its functionality has now been merged into the Umbraco libraries, so this package can be removed.
The Document class has been replaced by the Content class, which implements the IContent interface.
Content properties have their values returned directly instead of using a property class. .GetProperty("name").value becomes GetValue("name") .
Services are now longer static, but are provided as singletons on the Umbraco Application context. DataTypeDefinition dataType = DataTypeDefinition . GetAll (). FirstOrDefault ( dt => dt . Text == dataTypeName ); Becomes var dataTypeService = ApplicationContext . Current . Services . DataTypeService ; IDataTypeDefinition dataType = dataTypeService . GetAllDataTypeDefinitions (). FirstOrDefault ( dt => dt . Name == dataTypeName );
PreValues are now keyed and handled as dictionaries instead of lists of strings. Legacy support is provided for loading existing PreValue collections as string lists, but they the method to save updated PreValues will only accept a dictionary. var values = PreValues . GetPreValues ( dataType . Id ). GetValueList (). Cast < PreValue >(); becomes var dataTypeService = ApplicationContext . Current . Services . DataTypeService ; var values = dataTypeService . GetPreValuesCollectionByDataTypeId ( dataType . Id );
If you are using an IoC container to resolve controllers, you will have to register the umbraco controllers. In Autofac builder.RegisterApiControllers(typeof(UmbracoApplication).Assembly);
If upgrading Autofac to version 4, after the container is build you no longer deal with IContainer , but solely with ILifetimeScope .
Gotchas
If you have the normal global MVC route registered ( /{controller}/{action}/{id} ), it will interfere with Umbraco and prevent it from being able to resolve templates. This was not an issue in Umbraco 4, as pages ended with .aspx, but pages in Umbraco 7 are extensionless. If you need to use custom controllers, it is recommended to recommend inherit from one of the Umbraco controller classes, such as SurfaceController and use the route umbraco registers for it. If custom routing is needed, it should be limited to avoid interference with umbraco.
Next up I will detail the challenges encountered when rebuilding Umbraco backoffice custom sections for Umbraco 7.
Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) has been reportedly tapping into fiber-optic lines to intercept and store massive amounts of data flowing across the web, including emails, posts on social media sites like Facebook, video chats and calls, and records of what websites the public is visiting, according to a new report from The Guardian. The data collected in the spying program, which is called Tempora, is reportedly shared between the UK and the National Security Agency (NSA), the US spy organization behind the surveillance program PRISM. Between the GCHQ, the NSA, and US contractors, about 850,000 people have had access to the data, the report said.
Tempora began 18 months ago and during that time, the GCHQ collected data that "included recordings of phone calls, the content of email messages, entries on Facebook and the history of an internet user's access to websites," The Guardian said, noting that the British government considers its actions both secret and legal. The report says that data Snowden says Tempora is bigger than PRISM collected through Tempora is stored an analyzed for up to 30 days, and siphoned "under a system of safeguards, and had provided material that had led to significant breakthroughs in detecting and preventing serious crime." Edward Snowden — a former NSA contractor, who blew the whistle on PRISM two weeks ago with leaks to The Guardian and The Washington Post — is The Guardian's source for the leak on Tempora. The information from Snowden comes after a Q&A session with The Guardian in which Snowden defended his actions while also sidestepping questions about further details on PRISM. Snowden said then that he'd deliver more evidence of huge government spying programs, and today's Guardian report seems to follow through on that.
Snowden tells the publication that the data collected comes from both those who are and aren't suspected of any wrongdoing. Snowden also says that the UK's spying efforts are worse than the US's alleged intrusions. Tech companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and others have yet to fully detail their involvement in the government's pursuit of user data — though each company has challenged assertions that they provide the government with direct access. The Obama administration has defended the legality of the NSA's actions and downplayed privacy implications. And, so far, neither Snowden nor The Guardian have publicly shared all the evidence on either PRISM or Tempora they say they have. The only thing that seems to be clear right now is that this saga is far from over.
Still too many unanswered questions
The Guardian said the Tempora documents that Snowden shared with it "suggest some companies have been paid for their co-operation and GCHQ went to great lengths to keep their names secret." The sources who worked with the GCHQ at each of these companies were given some anonymity within the agency, so that the government staff wouldn't know where the data they were looking at originated from, the report said. None of the companies working with the GCHQ on Tempora are named in the report, but not all of those cooperating are doing so willingly. "Should they decline, we can compel them to do so," a government source told The Guardian. "They have no choice." The GCHQ has used secret warrants to force companies into sharing user data, the report said. The internal disguising of sources was done due to a "fear that the role of the companies as intercept partners would cause 'high-level political fallout,'" The Guardian said.
600 million 'telephone events' observed each day
Tempora, the report says, is on a scale larger than any known surveillance program coming from the US or its allies, some of which allegedly have an agreement to work together on such programs. "Two years after the project was first trialled, it was able to boast it had the 'biggest internet access' of any member of the Five Eyes electronics eavesdropping alliance, comprising the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand," The Guardian said. While hundreds of thousands of people in the UK and the US have access to Tempora data, the two nations also have a team of 300 GCHQ and 250 NSA analysts tasked with combing through the findings. According to the documents Snowden handed over to the publication, the GCHQ was able to observe 600 million "telephone events" each day last year.
The Guardian's unnamed government source said in the report that the GCHQ and NSA aren't looking over every bit of data collected. "Essentially, we have a process that allows us to select a small number of needles in a haystack," the source said. "There are certain triggers that allow you to discard or not examine a lot of data so you are just looking at needles. If you had the impression we are reading millions of emails, we are not."
U.S. defense officials say the United States has deployed several Predator drones to the West African country of Niger to fly surveillance missions in support of French troops battling Islamists in neighboring Mali.
The officials quoted in U.S. news reports say the unarmed robotic aircraft are to be based near the Niger capital, Niamey, along with a contingent of about 100 U.S. military personnel.
U.S. President Barack Obama notified Congress Friday that the U.S. force would provide support for intelligence gathering.
Obama did not explicitly reveal the drone base in his letter. Troops arriving Wednesday in Niger were largely Air Force personnel there to support drone flights.
The officials said the drones are for reconnaissance only and would not be equipped with missiles.
The United States and Europe have voiced fears that al-Qaida militants and their allies are seeking to expand their influence, turning parts of West Africa into a global security threat.
French forces entered Mali in January to push back militants moving toward the capital, Bamako.
France has since said it plans to begin withdrawing its ground forces and hand over military operations to the Malian army and an African force. France also has urged the United Nations to establish a peacekeeping mission in Mali.
Earlier Friday, Malian authorities said at least five people were killed in an apparent suicide car bombing in northern Mali, near a rebel base. The dead include the two suspected bombers.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Bayesian networks (and probabilistic graphical models more generally) are cool. We computer geeks can love ‘em because we're used to thinking of big problems modularly and using data structures. But better than being cool, they're useful. Especially if you have the kind of problem that involves hundreds or thousands of interrelated variables, any one of which you might want to predict based on some subset of the others. Did I mention that your variables can have noisy, missing, or just plain unobservable data?
At Khan Academy, we've got problems like that.
What are the underlying concepts that relate mastery of our hundreds of exercises to each other?
Can we predict the best ordering of topics for a user to minimize time spent and maximize success?
What instructional interventions can an intelligent learning system make to the best aid the user?
So I sat down to start applying these tools, and there were plenty of online resources to help with the book learnin'. I'm not going to duplicate them–I recommend this or that. When I started coding, though, I had several practical questions and really wanted a simple code example. I didn't find a great one, so I'm posting what I came up with in the hope of helping the next soul.
THE WORKING EXAMPLE
For our example problem, let's say there is a hidden (unobservable) binary variable T for every Khan Academy user that represents whether they have mastered a given topic (1=mastered, 0= not mastered). You can think of a topic as a collection of any N exercises. While topic mastery is hidden, we can partially observe performance on the exercises in that topic. I say ‘partially' because the user may not do problems on all of the exercises. So the example program needs to handle missing data for all of the exercise variables E_i, which for simplicity can also be binary variables (1=good performance, 0=bad). In the idiom of Bayes nets, then, our graph looks like this:
Of course, lots of problems could be modeled by this simple graph structure of a hidden parent variable with a collection of children with missing data. Let me know if you invent another interesting application!
THE CODE
Here's the code. It contains functions to learn from a simulated example or from a data file representing the evidence from your child variables. The learning algorithm is an expectation-maximization, of which the most interesting piece is the expectation step where we must impute the hidden T-variable given whatever E-variable evidence is available for that data sample. To see the algebra worked out using Bayes rule, check out this excellent write-up courtesy of Jascha.
If for some sad reason you have an aversion to matrices (or NumPy), you might also take a look at my rough draft version written with the excellent Pandas library instead of just NumPy. (It doesn't support handling of missing data for the E-variables and I ended up converting strictly to NumPy for speed.)
What I find fascinating (and what the Pandas version illustrates nicely) is that the most complicated math really needed here is… counting! The idea that we can learn the full joint distribution with nary a gradient or a step size parameter in sight kind of feels like magic to me.
PRACTICAL TIPS AND TRICKS, TRIALS AND ERRORS
A few lessons learned here and over the years:
Learning from simulated data is very useful for testing and debugging your algorithm. Two useful tests are:
Make sure your algorithm learns a model for which you know the true distribution.
If the above doesn't work, initialize your parameters to the correct values and see if they “walk away”
Graphing the log-likelihood evolution is helpful to visualize convergence behavior.
I initially tested an example model with just two children variables. That system was “underdetermined” because there were more parameters than constraints. That made things not converge as expected, and I spent many hours searching for a bug before I was mercifully rescued.
When imputing values, make sure you calculate probabilities and sample from that distribution (or pass the full distribution through to future imputations).
THE PAYOFF
Despite the simplicity of this example, it is already Really Useful. I created a data set for a subset of the Khan Academy exercises, which you can download here. I heuristically chose a definition for the E-variables of whether a user answered more or less than 85% of problems correct on an exercise. Once I had learned the full joint distribution (“theta” in the code), I could infer the probability of mastery for a given user on any exercise, including exercises for which they had not yet done any problems. When I plugged those predictions in as an additional feature to our accuracy model, it was a highly significant feature, especially on the first few problems done for an exercise.
Of course, there are many different ways we could construct new features to summarize performance across a pool of exercises, but this is a clean, robust, and transparent option. It's easily extended to a full hierarchical model of our knowledge map. And the graphical modeling framework is powerful enough that we can eventually accomodate temporal effects, a decision-making agent, prior knowledge of experts (hello, teachers!), and more.
NEXT STEPS
I'm tremendously excited about the potential of probabilistic graphical models to power optimized online learning at Khan Academy and elsewhere. If you're interested in learning about these modeling techniques in general, hustle over to Stanford's free and recently-launched online course, and follow me on Twitter for more practical examples and updates. If you want to directly improve the future of education, there's a place to do that, too.
[lxc-devel] LXC security issues - affects all supported releases
Hello, During a security audit of LXC by Roman Fiedler, two security issues with LXC have been found and now fixed. CVE 2015-1331: This issue is related to LXC's use of /run/lock and /tmp as places to write the container lockfile. As those two paths are world writable, an attacker could write a symlink at the location LXC would use to write its lock file, leading to the potentially privileged LXC process to create the target file. This was introduced with LXC 1.0.0 with the following commit: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/71b0fed669a088675c1344ed68b250e87414c998 The fix for LXC 1.0 is: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/f547349ea7ef3a6eae6965a95cb5986cd921bd99 The fix for LXC 1.1 is: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/61ecf69d7834921cc078e14d1b36c459ad8f91c7 The fix for LXC master is: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/72cf81f6a3404e35028567db2c99a90406e9c6e6 CVE 2015-1334: This issue is related to LXC's setting of AppArmor profiles and SELinux labels during attach. The code was trusting /proc in the container which an attacker with root access to the container could overmount, leading to attach running user controlled code (as is usually the case) but without any LSM protection. This was introduced in LXC 0.9.0 with the following commit: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/9958532bff244ddca65503b42d31c8a4b90b11b1 The fix for LXC 1.0 is: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/15ec0fd9d490dd5c8a153401360233c6ee947c24 The fix for LXC 1.1 is: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/659e807c8dd1525a5c94bdecc47599079fad8407 The fix for LXC master is: https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/5c3fcae78b63ac9dd56e36075903921bd9461f9e LXC 0.9 is out of support so we will not be issuing patches or updated tarballs for it. Both fixes will be included in the upcoming stable releases for both branches. We expect LXC 1.1.3 to be tagged over the next few days and LXC 1.0.8 in the next month or so. So we very strongly recommend distributions grab the above fixes in the meantime. The delay in releasing updated tarballs comes from us having a pretty significant backlog of fixes in both branches that require significant testing before we can release. The security teams from the various Linux distributions have been informed of those security issues ahead of time and so should have or soon will be pushing security updates to their supported releases. I'd like to thank Roman for his great work at finding and responsibly disclosing those issues to us. -- Stéphane Graber Ubuntu developer http://www.ubuntu.com -------------- next part -------------- A non-text attachment was scrubbed...

If our readers have paid attention to their social media feeds over the last week or so, many of them will have noticed countless virtue signals from the #MeToo campaign. A male feminist spinoff of this putrid witch-hunt, #IHave, is now comparing not responding to a girl's text messages to abusing her sexually. Apparently “rape culture,” which is about as fictional as that giant annoying dog from The Neverending Story, is perpetuated by men not writing back to girls after they've had sex with them. Not texting a reply to her leads to rape, remember!
What we are witnessing is the realization by feminists and others that actual rape is at an all-time low. Still, people, SJWs most of all, need their boogeymen and scapegoats. Consequently, behaviors women themselves engage in (flaking, ignoring SMS invitations from interested males, etc.) are presently being equated with promoting rape when it is men who are performing them. “Ghosting,” an unspoken refusal to communicate with someone, is evidently such an affront to women that it has been included in the “rape culture” lexicon.
Of course, a perennial topic of game, including by Roosh in Bang, is dealing with girls who flake on dates, don't text back, or fail to pick up the phone. If only Roosh's readers and readers of Return Of Kings could accuse a woman of furthering “rape culture” every time she doesn't respond to them! We could resolve common female antics almost overnight if that were the case.
Yes, this is real
The virtue signals being offered by men at the moment may differ from one another somewhat, but this is the general sort of thing being plastered on Facebook and other social media platforms [the emphasis is mine]:
#Ihave
I have assumed she knew we were just “hooking up” on a regular basis with no strings attached.
I have stared way too long, not caring if she catches me checking her out.
I have gone ahead with sex without having the time or inner sensing to see if that is what I actually wanted.
I have ghosted someone after hooking up a few times.
I have assumed consent once is consent always.
I've used intoxication as an excuse for “coming on strong.”
I have emotionally hurt women I've cared about through sex.
I have leaned heavily on the emotional labor of woman to teach me how to be a better man to them.
I have tolerated “locker room talk.”
I have tolerated cat-calling by my friends.
I have wielded my “power-over” in many ways to get what I want.
I'm not a bad man, I'm waking up within a rape culture and learning everyday what it means to feed life instead of stealing it. I'm not posting this as a confession or in an effort to absolve my sins, but to give examples of how I've learned that I have contributed to rape culture in order to encourage other men to do the same.

– Copy/paste if you have ever contributed to harassment and rape culture or failed to confront or prevent it (modify as appropriate). Don't leave it up to the women, gender non-conforming folks, and smaller number of men who have suffered sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape, to address a problem they didn't cause.
(Note to other men: Please do not leave comments praising me for posting this. The focus is on survivors, not heaping unearned praise on men who had to hurt people to learn how to be decent humans. Feel free to share your own stories/apologies though.)
Let's take a look at some of these points.
I have assumed she knew we were just “hooking up” on a regular basis with no strings attached.

What do women expect? With girls racking up historically high notch counts, the majority of relationships are not really relationships. In fact, as Return Of Kings has stated a number of times before, men are the real romantics, which is usually to their detriment. Most, if not all ambiguity about the nature of sexual relationships (random fuck or “I'm going to marry him”) would be removed if women valued their virginity and near-virginity more.
In the context of pathetic male apologies for “advancing rape culture,” #IHave recklessly throws consensual sex with a woman into the same basket as sexually abusing her. With so few examples going around of men beating girls in the head and forcibly penetrating them, a woman voluntarily entering a bed with you will now suffice as sexual assault if you do not later requite her feelings and pursue a long-term relationship with her.
I have stared way too long, not caring if she catches me checking her out.
Yes, because women dressed and behaving like the girl below, constituting an ever growing number amongst the fairer sex, are not trying to court any attention whatsoever. Worse still, they are obviously deeply traumatized when such attention comes their way:
I have ghosted someone after hooking up a few times.
Incidentally, this is the tactic actress Charlize Theron is said to have used on Sean Penn when she dumped him. Before I heard about this, I knew what “ghosting” was in basic terms, but had never come across the word itself. Given the sad state of male thirst in today's world, plus the time-honored, hardwired female practice of hypergamy, it's a safe bet that women utilize this a lot more than men.
I have emotionally hurt women I've cared about through sex.
Remember, this is the age of the snowflake and subjectivity, not facts, are king. Ivy League students, touting themselves as the cream of the crop, have meltdowns over Halloween costumes. So God knows what can happen when a man rejects a woman he has had sex with or simply does not do what she wants in any relationship.
Western society is beset with a divorce rate above 50% and most women have many sexual partners before marriage. As a result, are we to believe that it is ever possible for a woman with a notch count of, say, ten men to have not been emotionally “hurt” multiple times by a sexual partner? And this says absolutely nothing about whether the feelings she has are rational or justifiable, let alone whether they should be mentioned alongside a crime like sexual assault or rape.
Are you ready for the total conflation of hurt female feelings and “rape”?
Well, let's be honest. We have been approaching this outcome for a long while. Right now, however, the rot is accelerating beyond belief. The floodgates have well and truly opened with the downfall of Harvey Weinstein. Any slight a woman has suffered at the hands of a man (or concocted in her own mind) can be conveniently subsumed under a hashtag like #MeToo. No evidence is needed, only a Facebook or other social media post.
We should give the leftists credit—they have done a spectacular job in redirecting the focus onto the vague, otherwise easily disprovable idea of “rape culture” and away from the hypocrisy of liberal Hollywood. Likewise, the collapsing of real crimes like rape onto normal male behavior or, at worst, bad manners is steadily ensuring that the definition of sexual abuse is whatever hurts a woman's feelings.
Got your sex consent forms ready yet, gentlemen?

On Monday, America saw one of the largest debt increases in a single day in U.S. history. Aided by the debt limit increase and stop-gap government funding bill freshly signed into law, America's fiscal future is once again in the spotlight.
Expert commentary and social media posts talk about deficits and debt in abstract terms, leaving many to think how a $20-trillion debt affects them, and, if it does, what can be done to fix it?
ADVERTISEMENT
While it is easy to see the costs of federal taxes when they are deducted from your paycheck, the national debt is a much more subtle threat that affects Americans in a multitude of ways.
For one, needless spending wastes tax dollars today, while committing future taxpayers to pay back our debt tomorrow. According to the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS), “Deficit financing tends to crowd out greater levels of private investment in better economic conditions,” thus impacting American jobs.
CRS continues: “Such debt eventually must be repaid, either through spending reductions, tax increases, or combination of the two, and may also generate crowding out that could reduce future economic productivity.”
Increasing debt also leads to rising interest costs, which contributes directly to total debt without providing any benefits or services to the American taxpayer. When the Federal government runs a deficit, it borrows the difference from creditors, which include private citizens, businesses and foreign governments.
These creditors get paid an interest on their investment. In 2015, the U.S. spent over $200 billion, or 6 percent of the Federal budget, servicing interest on the debt. Save for entitlement and benefit programs, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that interest on our national debt will be the largest budget item in 2024, costing $800 billion.
In practical terms, this means future generations will be forced to pay taxes for the overspending committed by current generations, rather than investments in homeland security or infrastructure in their day.
Massive accumulating debt provides more money for Congress to spend now, at the cost of economic growth and opportunity of future generations.
According to CRS, “A growing federal debt could place a high burden on future generations and hinder economic growth. Rapid growth of federal debt could also increase the probability of a financial crisis or fears of a sovereign default.”
There should be no mistake; Washington's fiscal negligence is dramatically affecting opportunities for coming generations.
In fact, we're already seeing a decline in incomes for young Americans in the United States today. According to the U.S. Census, young Americans are making about $2,000 less, on average, than their parents did when they were young.
CBO, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and even the past Obama administration all agree that the current set of fiscal policies will lead to an unsustainable debt burden if left unchanged.
Erskine Bowles, former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonInviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Howard Schultz must run as a Democrat for chance in 2020 Trump says he never told McCabe his wife was 'a loser' MORE's chief of staff said: “I think today we face the most predictable economic crisis in history. Fortunately, I think it's also the most avoidable. I think it's clear, if you do simple arithmetic, the fiscal path that the nation is on is simply not sustainable.”
So what can we do about it?
Entitlement programs are the major driver of the national debt, and a serious debate ending with major reforms must take place soon if we are to avoid a fiscal calamity. But there are other things Washington can do to address our nation's fiscal problems, including in places where there should be broad agreement, like waste, fraud and duplication.
While waste is a relative term, many would agree that getting birds drunk to find out if they slur when they sing, as one government funded study sought to find out, is not as important as investments in life-saving medical care or fixing crumbling infrastructure.
No doubt you have probably seen one of the dozens of waste reports issued annually that usually leave people scratching their heads saying, “How is THIS a priority?”
Next, federal programs that have run astray squeeze the federal budget while offering little or no actual help for those who receive their services. GAO and inspectors general throughout the federal government have detailed ways to fix programs that are not meeting their intended goals, yet nothing is done.
Often, the hold up on these fixes is that every program, however inefficient or wasteful, has a constituency that some politician is protecting from reforms or elimination, leaving taxpayers to continually subsidize programs that are failing. For example, there is a federal program that subsidizes flights to wealthy New England vacation destinations.
Finally, duplicative programs must be addressed to achieve a more efficient and effective federal government. These duplicative programs often work at cross purposes, are administered by a variety of agencies with different rules and criteria and squander resources that could be used to better the lives of all Americans.
For example, according to GAO, there are at least 160 federal programs at 20 different federal agencies that support housing.
Years of failing to address our nation's fiscal house have put us in a shocking degree of risk. Boiled down, each individual's share of the debt totals $166,000, and unfunded liabilities, like Medicare and Social Security, total $875,000 per taxpayer.
It will be no small feat to reverse our unsustainable fiscal course. But if we want future generations of Americans to enjoy similar freedoms we share today, it should be our top priority, and we must start now.

Image caption Michael McLarnon was shot dead in north Belfast nearly 40 years ago
The family of a man shot dead by soldiers in 1971 has welcomed a report by the Historical Enquiries team which says he was an innocent victim.
Michael McLarnon, 22, was shot dead at Etna Drive in the Ardoyne area.
In 1975, Lieutenant Clifford Burrage told the family he shot Mr McLarnon as he was armed and organising IRA gunmen.
However, on Wednesday Mr McLarnon's sister Mary Kelly said the HET had found a different army patrol fired the shots and Michael was an innocent man.
Details of the report were released at a press conference by the Pat Finucane Centre.
Mr Burrage wrote to the McLarnon family four years after the killing admitting to shooting their son, then appeared with Mrs Kelly on the BBC's Facing the Truth programme in 2006.
Mrs Kelly told Wednesday's press conference the HET report had produced "irrefutable evidence that Michael was innocent".
"The HET not only thinks that Michael was a complete innocent victim, but also considers that Lieutenant Burrage - despite his longstanding claim - was not the person that shot Michael.
"During the review of the case, the HET found that the evidence Burrage had given over the years, including on the BBC programme, did not match the facts. "
She said the report found that another group of soldiers had fired two live rounds and plastic bullets at a crowd that had gathered in the area.
She said one of the bullets struck her brother as he stood at the gate of his house. He died hours later in the Mater Hospital.
"We welcome the HET's conclusion that Michael was a totally innocent victim," Mrs Kelly said.
"He was not in possession of a firearm that night and he was not organising other gunmen in Etna Drive."
Despite the HET's findings, Mrs Kelly said she did not regret going on the Facing the Truth programme with Mr Burrage, who she described as a "story-teller".
"At the end of the day it still highlighted Michael - that he was shot," she said.
The Pat Finucane Centre, representing Michael McLarnon's family, said the original investigation into the shooting by the Royal Military Police was irrevocably flawed.
November 11, 2015 - The NBA Development League and the Chicago Bulls announced today that the team has been granted the right to own and operate an NBA D-League club that will begin play in the 2016-17 season. The new team, which will play its home games at Sears Centre Arena in Hoffman Estates, Ill., will be the NBA D-League's record 22nd franchise, while the Bulls become the 13th NBA team to fully own and operate its NBA D-League affiliate.

Friends come in various packages. Some are obnoxious, some are annoying, some are sweet, some are quiet, and some are so opposite to you that you wonder... how did we even become friends? Of course, this doesn't mean you hate that friend, you just get intrigued often with that one weird friend's quirks and oddities. A good example of this would be... say a friendship dealing with a lolita and yanki. A lolita is someone who wears Victorian era fashions, thus donning the 'lolita' style fashion. A yanki is a delinquent youth. So... a girl in frills and a girl riding a motorbike, sounds like an unpromising friendship, right? Not really.
Meet Momoko Ryugasaki, a girl who is obsessed with lolita fashion and wishes she was born in the Rococo period in France. She is aloof and friendless, but believes firmly that her frilly clothes and ribbons will make her happy.She feels that she has no need for human companions, just her expensive dresses from Baby the Star Shines Bright.
Meet Ichiko Shirayuri, a tough rough yanki from an all-girls biker gang. She wouldn't dare to be caught dead in a frilly outfit. But despite her rough cool exterior, she's loyal to her gang and can be a bit naive at times. Nevertheless, one can say it was sheer fate or luck how these two girls meet.
Kamikaze Girls is a Japanese film based on the light novel , Shimotsuma Monogatari by Novala Takemoto. It displays the relationship between these two peculiar characters through their weird adventures. It's a great film for any foreign film buffs and for those who have the patience to deal with subtitles and a slow paced but entertaining plot. With countless laughs and some deep thoughts, not to mention a bit of action and even more weird characters, Kamikaze Girls is a great film just to watch and unwind, and reminds us that people can be friends despite their differences. Maybe that old adage is right, opposites attract?
A day after Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Kashmir will one day be part of Pakistan, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj Saturday said that this “dream will not be realised even at the end of eternity”.
Advertising
This is the strongest statement so far by the Ministry of External Affairs in the wake of Pakistan's statements on Kashmir. Islamabad has been reaching out to the international community over the last two weeks and even observed a Black Day earlier this week.
“Behind Pakistan's unabashed embrace and encouragement to terrorism lies its delusional though dangerous dream that ‘Kashmir will one day become Pakistan', as Prime Minister Sharif said yesterday. The whole of India would like to tell Prime Minister of Pakistan that this dream will not be realised even at the end of eternity. The whole of Jammu and Kashmir belongs to India. You will never be able to make this heaven on earth a haven for terrorists,” Swaraj said, flanked by Ministers of State M J Akbar and General (retd) V K Singh.
Pakistan's Prime Minister, she said, says his good wishes are with the people of Kashmir. “Sadly, it's not Pakistan's good wishes or moral or diplomatic support but its weapons and terrorism that it has exported to Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's dirty money, dangerous terrorists and duplicitous state institutions seek to destabilise the region. The statement of none other than the Prime Minister of Pakistan has betrayed this despicable design. But I would like to repeat that this dream of Pakistan will never be fulfilled,” she said.
She said the leadership of Pakistan, including its Prime Minister, praised Burhan Wani, a wanted terrorist commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen, as a martyr. “He was carrying an award of Rs 10 lakh on his head because he had perpetrated heinous crimes, including murder of elected representatives of local bodies and security forces/personnel,” she said.
Watch Video: What's making news
“Even more condemnable than these deplorable attempts from across our border to incite violence and glorify terrorists is the fact that these attempts have been undertaken by Pakistan's state machinery in active partnership with UN-designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed and other leading terrorists belonging to internationally proscribed organisations,” she said.

She took on Pakistan for its comments on human rights violations in Kashmir. “The country which has used fighter planes and artillery against millions of its own people has no right whatsoever to point a finger against our brave, professional and disciplined police and other security forces. Their restraint and respect for their fellow citizens is evident in the unusually high number of the injured personnel — more than 1700 — in the violence unleashed with the support from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir,” she said.

The GMO wars escalated earlier this month when the 2013 World Food Prize was awarded to three chemical company executives, including Monsanto executive vice president and chief technology officer, Robert Fraley, responsible for development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
The choice of Fraley was widely protested, with eighty-one members of the prestigious World Future Council calling it “an affront to the growing international consensus on safe, ecological farming practices that have been scientifically proven to promote nutrition and sustainability.”
Monsanto's Man
The choice of Monsanto's man triggered accusations of prize buying. From 1999 to 2011, Monsanto donated $380,000 to the World Food Prize Foundation, in addition to a $5 million contribution in 2008 to help renovate the Hall of Laureates, a public museum honoring Norman Borlaug, the scientist who launched the Green Revolution.
For some, the award to Monsanto is actually a sign of desperation on the part of the GMO establishment, a move designed to contain the deepening controversy over the so-called biotechnological revolution in food and agriculture. The arguments of the critics are making headway. Owing to concern about the dangers and risks posed by genetically engineered organisms, many governments have instituted total or partial bans on their cultivation, importation, and field-testing.
A few years ago, there were sixteen countries that had total or partial bans on GMOs. Now there are at least twenty-six, including Switzerland, Australia, Austria, China, India, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, Italy, Mexico and Russia. Significant restrictions on GMOs exist in about sixty other countries.
Restraints on trade in GMOs based on phyto-sanitary grounds, which are allowed under the World Trade Organization, have increased. Already, American rice farmers face strict limitations on their exports to the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, and are banned altogether from Russia and Bulgaria because unapproved genetically engineered rice “escaped” during open-field trials on GMO rice. Certain Thai exports—particularly canned fruit salads containing papaya to Germany, and sardines in soy oil to Greece and the Netherlands—were recently banned due to threat of contamination by GMOs.
The Case against GMOs Gains Strength
The case against GMOs has strengthened steadily over the last few years. Critics say that genetic engineering disrupts the precise sequence of a food's genetic code and disturbs the functions of neighboring genes, which can give rise to potentially toxic or allergenic molecules or even alter the nutritional value of food produced. The Bt toxin used in GMO corn, for example, was recently detected in the blood of pregnant women and their babies, with possibly harmful consequences.
A second objection concerns genetic contamination. A GMO crop, once released in the open, reproduces via pollination and interacts genetically with natural varieties of the same crop, producing what is called genetic contamination. According to a study published in Nature, one of the world's leading scientific journals, Bt corn has contaminated indigenous varieties of corn tested in Oaxaca, Mexico.
Third, a GMO, brought into natural surroundings, may have a toxic or lethal impact on other living things. Thus, it was found that Bt corn destroyed the larvae of the monarch butterfly, raising well grounded fears that many other natural plant and animal life may be impacted in the same way.
Fourth, the benefits of GMOs have been oversold by the companies, like Monsanto and Syngenta, that peddle them. Most genetically engineered crops are either engineered to produce their own pesticide in the form of Bacillus thurengiensis (Bt) or are designed to be resistant to herbicides, so that herbicides can be sprayed in massive quantities to kill pests without harming the crops. It has been shown, however, that insects are fast developing resistance to Bt as well as to herbicides, resulting in even more massive infestation by the new superbugs. No substantial evidence exists that GM crops yield more than conventional crops. What genetically engineered crops definitely do lead to is greater use of pesticide, which is harmful both to humans and the environment.
A fifth argument is that patented GMO seeds concentrate power in the hands of a few biotech corporations and marginalize small farmers. As the statement of the eighty-one members of the World Future Council put it, “While profitable to the few companies producing them, GMO seeds reinforce a model of farming that undermines sustainability of cash-poor farmers, who make up most of the world's hungry. GMO seeds continue farmers' dependency on purchased seed and chemical inputs. The most dramatic impact of such dependency is in India, where 270,000 farmers, many trapped in debt for buying seeds and chemicals, committed suicide between 1995 and 2012.”
Some studies have sought to counter these accusations against GMOs, but they have been discredited by revelations that they were funded by biotechnology firms or conducted by researchers close to them.
The Philippines as GMO Battlefield
The key battleground in the battle over GMOs has shifted, over the years, from the developed to the developing world. The GMO advocates have deployed their big guns to convince African, Asian and Latin American governments to shift to GMOs. Among them are Bill and Melinda Gates, Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs, and Oxford economist Paul Collier, who argues that Africa needs a new “Green Revolution” based on genetically engineered seeds because it missed out on the first one, which was promoted by chemical-intensive agriculture.
The Nation is facing a crippling postal rate hike—donate by October 31 to help us foot this $120,272 bill.
The Philippines is one such battleground. Even as many other countries have tightened their controls over GMOs, the Philippine government has become more and more liberal in its granting of licenses for GMO production. According to Greenpeace Southeast Asia, it has allowed the importation of sixty genetically modified plants and plant products for direct use as food and feed or for processing, an additional eight GM plant varieties for propagation, and twenty-one modified plant varieties for field testing in Philippine soil. Despite concerns about its impact on the environment, Bt corn now has 750,000 hectares of Philippine land devoted to it. According to Greenpeace Southeast Asia spokesman Daniel Ocampo, no GMO application has ever been rejected, which is rather shocking given the controversy over their use.
A key reason for the liberal treatment of GMOs is the revolving door among government, academia and corporations. For instance, three of the most recent directors of the prestigious Institute of Plant Breeding of the University of the Philippines at Los Banos have either joined biotech multinationals or gone to work on projects funded by them. They also serve as members of or advisers to government bodies that oversee biosafety.
Judicial Restraints on GMOs
Anti-GMO activists and farmers have nevertheless made headway. Even as some makes direct action forays like uprooting Bt eggplant field experimental sites, others have worked on the legal front. This paid off recently when the Philippine Court of Appeals—acting on a petition brought before it by Greenpeace, the NGO Masipag and several individuals—stopped the field testing of Bt eggplant on the grounds that there was no scientific consensus or legal framework for the introduction of Bt products. Importantly, the court also ruled that all stakeholders—not just industry or government scientists—should get to provide input on the introduction of GMOs like Bt eggplant.
In a sign of desperation, the University of the Philippines at Los Banos, one of the respondents in the case, argued that a ban on field testing of Bt eggplant would “violate academic freedom.” The court ruling stated, however, that, “Like any other right, the right to academic freedom ends when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint. The right to academic freedom does not, in any way, give the respondent UPLB unbridled freedom to conduct experimentation, studies and research that may put to risk the health of the people and the environment which are equally protected under our fundamental law.”
It is unlikely, however, that this victory will discourage the GMO lobby from making the Philippines into a springboard for the introduction of Bt crops to the rest of Southeast Asia. Aside from Bt eggplant, the GMO advocates are pushing genetically altered “Golden Rice,” potatoes, soybeans, canola, cotton, sugarbeet and alfalfa. There's big money in these crops, and the only thing that stands between the transnational corporations and big money are those pesky farmers, environmentalists and consumers.
Unfortunately for the biotech corporations, more people are listening to the words of scientists like Dr. Oscar Zamora, vice chancellor of the University of the Philippines at Los Banos, who says: “For every application of genetic engineering in agriculture in developing countries, there are a number of less hazardous and more sustainable approaches and practices with hundreds, if not thousands, of years of safety record behind them. None of the GE applications in agriculture today are valuable enough to farmers in developing countries to make it reasonable to expose the environment, farmers and the consumers to even the slightest risk.”

The first time that a person who wasn't black used the word "nigga" to address me face-to-face came when I was out of the country. I was playing basketball for a team in a small, largely Croatian village in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I was walking down the street when I passed three adolescent boys going in the other direction on the opposite side. They were visibly excited to come across a black person in the flesh and called out to me: "Hey man, what's up? Hey, my nigga, how you do?" I didn't respond. I didn't know how to respond. I kept walking, feeling my ears burn and my jaw tighten. In my mind I saw images of barking dogs. The rest of the walk home was a blur. When I had cooled down, I wondered: Were they really trying to insult me? Or had their exposure to black culture led them to believe that this was how I'd like to be greeted?
There are generally four schools of thought on the word "nigga." There's the first and largest group -- black working-class (but not exclusively so) people who say it casually because it's what they've always done, or simply because they don't like being told what to do. There's the small but vocal group of middle-class black intellectuals who claim to have "reclaimed" the word, to have turned it into a term of endearment instead of a tool of oppression. It's a neat solution to a messy problem. It ends in "A," after all! This line of thinking is what led us to where Kanye West is currently -- "re-contextualizing" Confederate flags as tour merch. This last seems idiotic at first blush but might yet be proven to be genius. It's too early to talk about it with any sort of nuance, but it's a good marker of the extreme left of the dialogue.
The third group is comprised of the "respectable Negroes," the bootstrap types, the "don't you embarrass me in front of these white folks" crowd. Also largely middle- and upper-middle class, the worst of these would have us believe that if black men only pulled their pants up, stopped littering and stopped calling each other that word, racism and poverty would come to an end.
Last but certainly not least you have the extremely sympathetic older generation that worked to have the word eradicated from white people's vocabularies only to find it shouted from street corners and blasted from car windows in the future they worked so hard for. Carried to the extreme, it's best represented by the NAACP, which literally attempted to bury the word "nigga" in a well-intentioned but ultimately irrelevant funeral in 2007.
“ As I've played and traveled in various countries around the world, I've often been in situations with another person or their family and realized that this was their very first time meeting a person with skin like mine, shaking his or her hand or breaking bread over the dinner table. It is a strange weight to go from "representing your race" to Representing Your Race, but certainly bearable. ”
Our academics would have us believe that the word is fine when in context, used without malice as a term of endearment. It's a simple equation in the U.S. Racism = prejudice + power. "White people" are excluded from using it because of their forefather's complicity in the slave trade and subsequent years of oppression. The paleness of their skin serves as prima facie evidence of their inability to use the word.
But where did the boys from Bosnia-Herzegovina fit in? They used it as a greeting. They were not a threat to me or my well-being. They didn't represent any white-power structure -- their country never had any slaves or colonies, and furthermore you'd be hard pressed to find any point in the past 100 or so years when the average Slav was better off from a material standpoint then a black American. If the word's power comes not from any intrinsic value but from the power structures behind it, why was I so angry?
As I've played and traveled in various countries around the world, I've often been in situations with another person or their family and realized that this was their very first time meeting a person with skin like mine, shaking his or her hand or breaking bread over the dinner table. It is a strange weight to go from "representing your race" to Representing Your Race, but certainly bearable. I've been unusually fortunate. For various socioeconomic reasons and sheer lack of numbers, very few African-Americans leave the United States. The percentage of Americans with passports is reported to be anywhere from 10 to 30 percent. Black passport ownership is believed to be some fraction of this. This means that for the vast majority of the world, the first (and likely only) exposure to African-American culture they will have in their lifetimes is through the Internet. Sports highlights, YouTube clips, memes. These people are receiving all of this without the framework that undergirds every interracial interaction in the U.S. This is not to say our rules are impossible to ascertain, but it makes it very, very difficult.
Highlights, music videos, memes. There is a very popular meme among black people that is occasionally funny, generally depressing and seemingly never-ending. It's called "Niggas Be Like." An example: A picture of a Stevie Wonder with the caption "NIGGAS BE LIKE: 'I'LL PAY YOU BACK NEXT TIME I SEE YOU.'" There are thousands of these on the Internet. You could easily copy and paste some of them on to a white supremacist site without anyone noticing; the conspiracy theorist in me wants to believe that's who keeps coming up with them. But the good ones are the sort of in-joke that has come to be understood as OK within cultures.
The first time I saw one of these, it had been posted by a former teammate of mine. The second person I saw repost one was a white girl. She was German, was dating an African-American soldier, felt like she had been given a pass. I know her personally, know she isn't racist. She is someone who wants to belong, and for whatever reason, the "pass" is seen as the ultimate sign that you're in. It actually is the natural extension of the tortured logic of that second school of thought -- if the word is now a term of love, of endearment, then a white person who can say that word without consequence is loved beyond any other. It would be, it must be, the pinnacle of white cool.
So who gets a pass? Most people, myself included, would argue that people with a black parent are fine. It didn't anger me when I heard that Matt Barnes used it. Conversely, I was dismayed to hear that Richie Incognito used it openly and often, but I know how locker rooms work. All it takes is one black guy to say, "Come on, man, you can say it, you know you my nigga" and all hell breaks loose. It's like a gun ban or a tax increase -- not feasible in a world of people with differing standards.
I've been in locker rooms where European players used it nonchalantly around black players, mostly when singing along to song lyrics. Occasionally, I'd pull someone aside and ask them to stop. This was mostly greeted with a look of confusion, an unanswerable question ("But why do you guys say it so much if it's such a terrible word?") and, finally, acceptance and an agreement not to do it again.
Outside of that basic, American, black/white binary, the lines are hard to define. What about Puerto Ricans and Dominicans? Africans? Indians? Last year during a casual conversation, a half-Malian, half-French teammate told me, "Nigga, quit lying!" I asked him not to call me that, please. He was genuinely hurt. "What, I'm not black enough to say that? I don't count?" It dawned on me that it wasn't just his attempt at speaking my language -- it was an expression of solidarity. It was an assertion of blackness. He was placing his flag on the ground. I told him that it had nothing to do with being black enough, or that he somehow hadn't earned the right. It was just simply that I'd prefer to be called something else.

That's the best way to describe how I feel. I'd prefer to be called something else. Call me by name. I try to express this quietly. I'm not interested in shaming anyone, so if I don't have the opportunity to say something privately, I won't say anything at all. I think it can be addressed only on an individual level. Personally, I make an effort not to use it, but I reject the notion that it makes me a better person. It's what works for me. I would prefer not to be called that by anyone, but I understand why certain black people do it. Everyone's experience is different. I grew up fairly privileged, in a family in which I never heard the word uttered. I can't be certain that they never said it privately, but my parents made an effort to set the example for me that it wasn't appropriate. I knew without asking or ever broaching the subject. My mother would even balk at a description of another person as "dark-skinned" or "light-skinned." She'd ask, "Isn't there a better way you can describe that person?" I was never truly in the habit of saying "nigga," it was just something I did as a teenager because that's what other kids did. This made it easy for me to give it up. I can't judge other people who have a stronger attachment to it.
Though I dislike the word, what I dislike even more is people moralizing as if poverty, discrimination and institutional racism are the proper rewards for a few slips of the tongue. These critiques are almost always classist and sometimes explicitly so, with privileged people bemoaning a "lack of class" or a "bad upbringing." This sort of asinine scolding only serves to derail the conversation. They lead to people equating words with weapons. It can never be said enough: The tools of enslavement were not words. The tools of enslavement were guns and ships and limited liability companies. Slavery doesn't start with you calling me a nigger instead of sir; it starts when you have a gun and I have a sharpened stick. And it ends not with dictionaries or thesauruses, but with you putting down the gun. It's the age-old swindle of I'll respect you when. "I'll respect you when you pull up your pants, when you stop talking like that, when you cut that hair." For women, it comes as "I'll respect you when you cover your hair. Your midriff. Your knees. Your ankles. Your face." This is a con game, and I sympathize with those who refuse to play it.
Still, I don't know what to say to the older generation. It must be a particular sort of hell to strain against oppression, toe the line cautiously for decades, only to see young black men make millions from rhyming "niggerish" with "nigga-rich." It's unfortunate but feels too late to interdict. The horse has bolted and galloped around the world, and they would have us lock the barn door from the inside.
This is, of course, impossible. The only way I see forward is a sort of live-and-let-live approach. For white people, I would still advise extreme caution. Please spare us your anecdotes about your noble black maid, your "I know my opinion doesn't mean anything, but gosh it makes me uncomfortable" op-eds. And please don't say it. This is hypocritical on its face; of course you have the right to say whatever you want. I know, I know, First Amendment. I even sort of understand the appeal. It's taboo, and everyone wants to get behind locked doors. I just think that this thing, this one thing and virtually nothing else in society, is something you probably shouldn't have. There are probably many younger people who disagree with me; I've heard that teenagers across the country of all races use it indiscriminately without anger. That would have been absolutely unthinkable to me only 10 years ago, but now it doesn't seem impossible. It could be that the future lies in nothing being off-limits to anyone. The world as an unrestrained, post-racial locker room.
Until it comes, we can only police ourselves and the areas around us. Sweep your own doorstep. I expect to be offended. I expect that I'll have to get used to it. The price we pay for modernity is always the discomfort of the old folks with some new aspect of it. I guess I'm getting old, too.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is attempting to walk a delicate line between social conservatives and his more libertarian-minded supporters, has been sending mixed messages of late on the issues of abortion and contraception.
“I think, and I often say in my speeches, that I don't think a civilization can long endure that doesn't respect the rights of the unborn,” Paul said in a conversation with the American Liberty Association last month.
Paul's most recent comments stand in contrast to what he told David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, in an April interview.
“I think where the country is, is somewhere in the middle, and we are not changing any of the laws until the country is persuaded otherwise,” Paul said at the time, explaining that though he believes life begins at conception, public opinion is too polarized for him to try to ban the procedure.
Paul's actions while in the Senate would seem to indicate where his heart lies on the matter. In March, he introduced the Life at Conception Act, a so-called "personhood" bill, which would grant legal rights to zygotes at fertilization.
Medical experts believe that personhood bills could also ban in vitro fertilization and some forms of birth control, along with abortion.
And yet at an event in Iowa last week, Paul distanced himself from legislative efforts like the personhood measure.
“It's been this narrative that's come from the other side … somehow saying we're some troglodytes who really are against birth control,” he said, according to CNN. “There may be various opinions in here, but there's probably almost nobody who wants to ban birth control. I haven't heard any Republican politician who does.”
After being rematched for the second year in a row, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to receive anything.
Because of that, my reddit secret santa gift exchange spirit was plummeting. Enter: my rematcher! He/she contacted me and said "not to worry!". They told me that I would be receiving part 1 of 2 gifts soon. I was immediately excited and told my wife that she should take back all of the "told you so" talks she'd given me.
A few days later I received a box with three DIY books. I was happy with those (because that's awesome) but underneath the last book in the box was a gift card to Home Depot for $200!!!! Whaaaaaaaat?!
This weekend I will be trying to plan the best DIY project I can think of for my "toy" room in my "man cave" (I know, I know). I'm pretty excited! And there's still another part to the gift??????? WHHHHAAAAT?!
Thank you so much, whoever you are from Tucson, AZ. You're doing good things. Next year, instead of saying "no thanks" to the exchange I will be signing up to be a rematcher!
Since recession-driven job losses bottomed out in early 2010, Kansas has consistently trailed the nation and most surrounding states in private-sector job creation, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
And that trend is mostly continuing in 2014, the data shows.
Job creation has emerged as a major issue in the race for governor between incumbent Sam Brownback and challenger Paul Davis, the House minority leader from Lawrence.
The two sides offer wildly conflicting claims about jobs, with Brownback citing the creation of more than 55,000 private-sector jobs on his watch and record-setting employment in Kansas.

Davis criticizes the governor's plan of using income tax cuts and exemptions to spur job growth as a “failed experiment” that hasn't met Brownback's lofty promises of a “shot of adrenaline to the heart” of the state's economy.
So what's really happening with jobs? According to the Labor Bureau's employment survey:
▪ Kansas jobs have risen at a more or less steady pace, between 1 and 2 percent a year, since the recession bottomed out in early 2010, regardless of who's in the governor's office.
▪ Kansas saw its highest post-recession percentage of job growth in 2011, the year before Brownback and the state Legislature slashed business taxes in an effort to spur job creation.
▪ The only year since the recession that Kansas job growth beat the national rate was 2010, former Gov. Mark Parkinson's first and only full year in office.
▪ Kansas has yet to return to its peak private-sector employment of 1,136,400 jobs, which came in March 2008 under then-Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. In July, the most recent month of final data, the bureau showed Kansas with 1,129,800 jobs, 6,600 jobs south of the 2008 peak.
▪ In comparison to neighboring states, Kansas has consistently beaten Missouri in percentage of job growth, but trailed Oklahoma, Nebraska and Colorado.
Job counts vary
To understand job creation, you need to understand that the Bureau of Labor Statistics actually releases results from two job surveys every month, said Malcolm Harris, an economist and professor of finance at Friends University in Wichita.
One is called the Current Population Survey, or Household Survey, which is based on a national sampling of 60,000 households by the Census Bureau and is used to calculate the overall unemployment rate.
The other is called the Current Employment Survey, also known as the Payroll Survey, which gathers data from a sampling of 554,000 business establishments, representing about a third of total nonfarm employment.
According to Harris, there are some significant differences between the two.
The biggest is that the Household Survey is more generous in its definition of a job. It includes people who work on their own farms, unincorporated self-employed people, unpaid relatives who work in a family business and workers who are absent from their jobs without pay.
The Payroll Survey excludes all those groups except for agricultural loggers.
By and large, politicians in campaign mode tend to cite from whichever survey makes them look better.
In the current election, Brownback has used the Payroll Survey for his claim of 55,000 new jobs on his watch, which is what the survey shows. He has used numbers from the Household Survey, which includes unpaid and family workers, to bolster his claim that more Kansans are working than ever before.
While the Payroll Survey showed Kansas employment peaking in 2007, employment figures derived from the Household Survey indicate that state employment was at its highest in May of this year at 1,423,784. From May to July, that number dropped by about 400 workers.
“Wall Street follows the Payroll Survey because it's less noisy, it doesn't jump around as much,” Harris said.
Results of the Payroll Survey come in two basic flavors, raw data and seasonally adjusted to smooth out spikes like the Christmas season, when stores hire large numbers of temporary and part-time workers.
The Eagle's analysis of employment is based on the Payroll Survey of private-sector jobs, seasonally adjusted, the numbers Brownback cites for his job-creation claim.
State follows nation
One thing that the data shows clearly is that Kansas job numbers are tied closely to what happens in the national economy.
The highest rates of job growth in the past 20 years were 1995-97, during a period of national and state prosperity, with Bill Clinton in the White House and Bill Graves in the Kansas governor's office.
In those three years, Kansas job growth ran at 2.7, 3.3 and 4.8 percent, adding more than 100,000 jobs to the economy in three years before tapering down to more normal levels going into the decade of the 2000s.
At a recent campaign appearance, Brownback's running mate, Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer, referred to the decade from 2000 to 2010 as “the lost decade” for job growth.
By one measure, it was. About 24,000 fewer people in Kansas were working in January 2010 than in January 2000.
But the data shows that Kansas actually grew jobs in five of those 10 years.
The big declines came almost entirely from two significant national events: the slowdown – particularly in the aviation industry – that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the Great Recession that began in 2008.
The biggest dive came in 2009, when the state lost almost 56,000 jobs in a single year, the deepest decline in 20 years.
Kansas' job turnaround actually began in February of 2010 on Parkinson's watch, the labor statistics show. The state added 13,400 jobs that year for a growth rate of 1.3 percent, barely edging the national rate of 1.2 percent, the data shows.
During Brownback's three full years in office, the state added 20,500 jobs in 2011 (1.9 percent), 11,700 jobs in 2012 (1.1 percent) and 17,000 (1.5 percent) in 2013. In the first half of this year, the state has added 6,400 jobs.
So far this year, Kansas trails the national job creation rate .6 percent to 1.2 percent.
Other states
Since the recession, Kansas has seen, at best, mixed results in job creation compared to neighboring states, the Payroll Survey shows.
▪ Missouri – This state is the bright spot for Kansas. Largely owing to Kansas City-area business migrating over the state line, Kansas has beaten Missouri on percentage job growth for four years straight. The best year for Kansas was 2011 when its jobs increased 1.9 percent to Missouri's 1.1. This year, Missouri could be making a comeback. The statistics show a 1.4 percent job increase there for the first half of the year, compared to .6 percent in Kansas.
▪ Nebraska – Unique among the neighboring states, Nebraska didn't lose any jobs during the recession and has been consistently adding jobs at 1.7 to 1.9 percent a year since 1999. Kansas hasn't beaten Nebraska's job growth since 2007, but might pull ahead this year based on a downward trend in Nebraska employment for the first half of 2014.
▪ Colorado – The Rocky Mountain state was hit harder than Kansas by the recession but has rebounded much faster, beating Kansas on job numbers since 2010. Its best year was a 3 percent increase in jobs in 2013, compared to 1.5 percent in Kansas.
▪ Oklahoma – Also harder hit by recession, Oklahoma has beaten Kansas in recovering jobs over the past four years. Last year, the Sooner state grew jobs at a 2.3 percent clip compared to Kansas' 1.5 percent.
Policy matters
Despite the heavy influence of the national economy, state policies do make a difference in job creation, said Martin Perline, a professor of labor economics at Wichita State University.
The centerpiece of Brownback's job creation effort was eliminating income taxes for owners of limited liability companies, sole proprietorships and corporations organized under Subchapter S of the federal tax code. Profits from those businesses are passed through to the owners, who pay the taxes on their personal income returns.
But after Brownback's changes to tax policy, those business owners no longer pay state income tax at the business or personal level, the theory being that they'll pump that extra income into their business and hire more employees, creating more jobs.
Perline said that's true but only to a degree.
“Anybody can lower taxes and create jobs,” he said. “I don't think that's an issue, you should be able to create jobs if you lower taxes. But the problem is you end up with a budget shortfall.”
A recent report by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute at the State University of New York showed that Kansas income and sales tax collections, the bulk of the state's general fund, were down almost 22 percent the second quarter of this year – far and away the biggest drop in the nation.
In a shortfall situation, state government has to either raise other taxes, which negates the effect of cutting income taxes, or cut spending, Perline said.
“If you cut expenditures, you're going to wind up cutting public jobs,” Perline said.
The Payroll Survey numbers show that government employment in Kansas has dropped by about 6,800 jobs since Brownback took office.
Cutting government jobs means cutting public services, Perline said. That, in turn can lead to private-sector job cuts because business decision-makers demand a standard of living that includes quality schools, highways, parks and other amenities.
“I think a lot of corporations that really compete for high-level people, those people want to be somewhere they want to live,” he said. “Lowering taxes means you're going to lower amenities because you don't have the money to pay for them. Living standards, amenities in the community are very important to these people, because a corporation might like to pay lesser taxes, but on the other hand, they've got to convince people sometimes to go where they're going.”
Brownback and the economic adviser who guided his plan, former Reagan Administration adviser Arthur Laffer, says that economic growth will eventually offset the initial state revenue shortfalls.
“Tax policy, particularly, tax policy takes time for it to have its impact,” Brownback said. “I think what you have to look at is your long-term trend cycles and your states.
“I think your best example you can look at, probably the best one, is the states that added the income tax – before when they didn't have one like in the ‘60s there was like seven or eight that added the income tax – and if you compare them to them over their prior trajectory versus now, they're growing slower relative to what they were in the rest of the country. You can also look at the states without an income tax and by and large they grow faster.”
Perline said historical examples show that tax cuts will create jobs, but not enough to cover the lost tax revenue.
“The idea's wonderful,” Perline said. “It just doesn't work.”
He said most economic literature he's studied shows: “You get a little bounce and you may pick up in the short term maybe a third of that loss in revenue and over the long run pick up maybe half of it, but you're still out the other half. And that becomes the problem.”
Brownback, however, said he remains committed to his plan and believes it will bear fruit.
“I am certain that if you want to grow, the way you do it is not to raise your taxes,” he said. “ I am certain (raising taxes) is not the route to grow private sector job growth over a period of time.”

?Let's be honest gang, much as the 12-year old-versions of ourselves who got stuffed into lockers by guys in letterman jackets might hate to admit it, there aren't that many differences between comic book/sci-fi fans (from here on known as nerds) and sports fans. Plus, if you think about it, it's not the jocks who can tell you that former Detroit Tiger Ty Cobb held the record for most stolen bases at 892 until 1977 when Billy Hamilton came along and broke that record, but the guys who watched all the games at home or played team manager for the school team. Heck, some of us collectors even got our start with sports trading cards before moving on to those rad Marvel Super Heroes cards and eventually comics. So, with that in mind, we'd like to not only bring people together, but also make insulting broad generalizations about both by looking at the six ways nerds and sports fans are alike in increasing levels of obsessive nerdiness.
Daily List suggested by
Guphynda.
6) A Love of Themed T-Shirts
?Have you noticed that romantic-comedy fans don't run around in Valentine's Day T-shirts? Sure, within the last few years geeky T-shirts have become more popular than ever, but the sports fans have had us beaten in that department for decades. You can buy a jersey of any player from any team of any major sport with either their name or yours online somewhere, not to mention basic team shirts across the board. Too bad you can't just order up a shirt of your favorite character. What about all the Prez and Milly The Model fans out there? When will they get the chance to tell the world what they like in such a weirdly specific and public way without actually saying a damn thing? Hopefully never.
5) A Love of Gatherings of Fellow Nerds
?
Thanks to the nature of what sports fan love, events, they've been enjoying the company of their compatriots while also enjoying the subject of their obsession for a hundred years now either at the games themselves or with friends watching them on TV. Nerds just started getting the idea in the last 30 or 40 years with conventions for everything from comics to Star Trek and now everything else you can imagine. Throw on your favorite T-shirt, consume overly expensive food, stand in line for the bathroom even though you're probably a dude, look at the people dressed up in full-fledged costumes sideways and enjoy your obsession in the company of like minded individuals. Sounds like a convention to us. Or the last Pittsburgh Steelers game. The comparisons get even closer when you take sports memorabilia and card conventions. Hell, they're both swimming in unwashed masses trying to get the signatures of has-beens.
4) Obsessive Attention to Facts and Dates
Sure, maybe we had to look up that fact about Ty Cobb in the opener, but we can easily tell you the first appearances of an embarrassing number of superheroes, villains and even some supporting characters. The more obsessed the fan, the more intricate the knowledge. Hey, everyone knows Wolverine's first full appearance was in Incredible Hulk #181, but did you know he appeared in one panel of #180? Form there it's just a slippery slope of pouring over price guides, biographies and other books that put you further and further away from the touch of the opposite sex.
3) Irrational Hatred of People Who Love a Slightly Different Version of What They Love
Have you ever been the one DC fan in a room full of rabid Marvel zombies? You feel like the walls are closing in no matter how concisely and passionately you argue the merits of Batman over Captain America. It's the exact same thing when you show up wearing a Yankees hat at a red Sox game. Watch your back because both sides have been known to get violent for no good reason. It's just an opinion you goobers.
2) Cosplay
?T-shirts are one thing. They're usually easy to buy and don't involve veering from societal norms too much. Cosplay is a whole different beast. For nerds, this usually entails dressing up as their favorite character from anime, comics, TV or movies, but for sports fanatics, it's a completely different undertaking. These are the dudes who aren't satisfied with just wearing the $75 jersey, but go in for the face paint and then the crazy color-coated outfits that look like they may have been crafter by some of New York City's more creative homeless people. Hey, at least some nerdy characters won't get you a second look out in the real world, but face paint doesn't cut the muster anywhere, gang.
1) Undying Loyalty, Even When It Should Probably Die
Part of any fandom lies in the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Whether your favorite superhero kicks the right ass or your team has just finished off yet another losing season, we're in it for the ups and downs. Quality's an important part of that, of course. You want your teams to be of a high enough quality to win and your comics and moving pictures to be good enough to make up for the price of admission. Basically, no one wants to feel like they're not getting their money or time's worth. Well, that doesn't stop a lot of fans from dropping their favorites when they suck. Some people buy every single X-Men or Batman comic based solely on the fact that those characters are in the book regardless of quality, while sports fans will continue buying tickets for New Jersey Nets games even though, well, they're mostly terrible. The problem with this incredibly high level of loyalty is that you're actually helping make the thing you like suck even more. This is a general lesson for life that everyone should listen to, if people are making money regardless of the quality of their product, they're probably not going to look at the quality of that product to make improvements. Voting with your dollars is the most efficient form of democracy you can participate in. Sure, sometimes a book or a team will come around and you'll feel good because you're no fair-weather fan, but just look at how much time, money and, let's face because we're all emotional about this stuff, heartbreak, you wasted and try not to feel like a chump even though you've got a full run of Uncanny X-Men or have seen the last fifteen seasons of Nets games.
Last week I spoke on a panel at the Museum of Chinese Americans titled, "MOCACITIZEN: Let's Talk About Ferguson and Asian America." During this time of civil unrest and injustices around the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases, it's been invigorating to see Asian Americans across the country organize in support of #BlackLivesMatter.
As someone who is plugged into national Asian American activist networks, my social media feeds and inbox have been exploding with organized efforts to mobilize the Asian American community during this time. Actions have included local and national conversations, educational forums, a social media campaign launching #Asians4BlackLives, and showing up alongside other communities of color to march in the streets and shutdown the Oakland Police Department.
It makes me proud to know that I am part of a community that is proactive, visible and vocal about taking a stand against anti-blackness and aligning on the side of social justice for all.
However, none of this is shown in the news coverage I'm following about post-Ferguson protests. Asian Americans are consistently portrayed in mainstream media as invisible, passive, a model minority and worse of all, positioned in opposition to the black community.
Nevertheless, I've seen one Asian American man make major headlines -- NYPD rookie cop, Peter Liang, who fatally shot Akai Gurley on November 20th. Liang's timing in mainstream news coverage is not the least bit coincidental.
Where was the media coverage and public outrage when 19 year old Hmong American, Fong Lee, was fatally shot eight times by an officer who faced no penalty?
Where was the media coverage and public outrage when Vietnamese American, Cao Bich Tran, was fatally shot in 2003 by officers who were not indicted?
Where was the media coverage and public outrage when unarmed Michael Cho was fatally shot 11 times by La Habra police, who were declared of no wrongdoing?
Peter Liang's story supports a popular narrative that has historically positioned Asian Americans against other communities of color. Although the Asian American community is complex and nuanced due to its multi-generational and multi-ethnic nature, it is generally framed as the model minority, academically successful and compliant with authority.
Lee's, Tran's and Cho's stories contradict the mainstream narrative by revealing the reality of many Asian Americans as being impoverished, 1st generation, targeted by law enforcement and victims of injustice - from police brutality to deportation.
When I first saw Peter Liang's headline surface amidst the outrage of police brutality, I could feel the collective cringe of Asian Americans across the country shaking heads in angst. Understanding the power of mainstream media to shape minds and the historical pattern of Asian Americans being propped in anti-black racism, it was not far-fetched to feel as if this one story threatened to derail solidarity efforts.
In addition, it is not unheard of that some Asian Americans have participated in anti-blackness. This goes back to the fact that the Asian American community is a complex conglomerate that can not be characterized or defined as one. Without making excuses, anti-black racism by Asian Americans could be attributed to internalized racism from media and also the varying degrees of relationship to authority due to immigration and refugee backgrounds.
During the panel discussion, a black female ally expressed her frustration in seeing a lack of reciprocity with Asian Americans supporting black issues. Interestingly enough, her frustration resonated with me, except I had always felt there was non-reciprocity from the black community to show support for Asian American causes.
Regardless, I never allowed the observation to mutate into resentment. I was aware that tensions between the Black and Asian community exist as a result of media propaganda and lack of interracial community organizing and education.
Because if we truly care about supporting each other's communities, then attending an Asian American studies class should be just as important as an African American studies class.
By the end of the event, an Asian American woman in the audience mentioned that there would be another community meeting to discuss Asian American mobilization, specifically in response to the Peter Liang story and pending grand jury decision.
At that point, I reiterated the idea that mainstream media is a tool in promoting anti-blackness and Asian Americans are often a bolt to fasten that message. Which is why it is absolutely critical and necessary for us to continue being vocal, being present and being felt, so that it is clear where we stand. Mainstream media will continue to position Asian Americans in alignment with an anti-black racist agenda, so we must speak up to align ourselves on the side of justice for everyone.
City officials and neighborhood leaders celebrated the groundbreaking for Cincinnati's new $16 million Police District 3 Headquarters on Monday.
Located in Westwood, the 39,000 square-foot facility will replace what city and police officials consider an antiquated 105-year-old facility in East Price Hill.
While the City of Cincinnati has built or begun construction on several new fire stations, including one nearby in Westwood, this is the first new police station built in the city since in more than four decades.
“It used to be that when cities built civic buildings like this, they were places the community could come together,” Mayor Mark Mallory (D) said. “With District 3, we're doing that again. We want people to come here and feel comfortable coming here with their neighbors.”

According to city officials, the new police headquarters will serve 14 neighborhoods from a central location on the west side. A site that was specifically chosen due to the input provided during Plan Cincinnati.
To help further strengthen the concept of the police headquarters also serving as a community gathering place, city officials have ensured that the new facility will include community gathering space and public art. It is an approach to community building similar to what was done, with rave reviews, by Cincinnati Public Schools (CPS) when rebuilding its entire building portfolio.
The location is just a block away from Dater High School and Western Hills High School and sits in what was a vacant outlot of a suburban-style strip mall. Site plans show that the new facility will be built at the street and oriented toward the sidewalk.
While Cincinnati has been seen as a leader in green building when it comes to the rebuilding of CPS, its tax abatements for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rehabilitation and new construction, and public building in general, this will be one of the Queen City's greenest buildings.
The development team of Messer Construction, Triversity Construction and Emersion Design are aiming to achieve a LEED Platinum certification – the highest possible rating under the LEED system.
The development team also says that it has designed the structure to achieve Net Zero Energy Consumption through its geothermal mechanical systems, high performance building envelope and solar panels. The new Police District 3 Headquarters will also reduce potable water consumption by 30% thanks to on-site bio-retention cells and strategic use of site design materials.
City leadership also expects the project will reach 36.2% Small Business Enterprise (SBE) inclusion. If such a number is achieved, it would make it the highest percentage of SBE participation on any city project to-date.
According to project officials, construction is expected to take about a year-and-a-half and could start welcoming members of the community as early as July 2015.
Here we have yet another company that is preparing to compete with Tesla Motors in the electric car market. Chinese company LeEco built a plant in which they invested $1.8 billion and soon after that they have raised $1.08 billion for the development of its LeSee electric vehicle.
According to reports, when fully built, this facility will be capable of producing 400,000 cars per year. When you see these figures, you need to wonder if the Tesla will be getting one serious competitor and will the Chinese based carmaker come with a Tesla killer.
All the way in April one of the concept cars was introduced, LeSee, and even we are pretty sure that many things on this concept will be ditched for production version we can't deny that we really liked what we saw. We know that the production version will draw inspiration from this one so we tend to agree that it will look quite interesting.
Many of the features we are getting from Tesla cars will also be introduced by LeEco, and that is nothing strange since they tend to bring the latest tech available on the market. While the car is still far from production, and we do not have any release date we can only speculate about the final product.
Performance and range figures are still hidden, but reports suggest that top speed might be limited to 130 mph which is in line with what Model S and other Tesla cars offer. One of the main goals for LeEco with its LeSee EV is to create a fleet vehicle. You will be able to summon your car with a smartphone app after which it will pick you up or inform you when it will be available.
The hype about autonomous vehicles is not stopping, and even we could hear news about problems and possible deaths due to autopilot usage, LeEco is preparing this option for its car. Steering wheel will be retractable, folding into the dashboard as it is shown on cool animation. As soon as the vehicle approaches seats will be adjusted, which might be a cool feature but we are not sure about its usefulness.

Similar to Tesla we are getting large touchscreen display integrated into the dashboard. It has different orientation and size is unknown but what we could see is that it will offer some impressive options. Navigation is certainly one of those, and one of the images provided shows pretty nice options for it. Furthermore, passengers in the back seat will get two displays mounted in headrests of front seats so the entertainment for kids will be on a pretty high level.
Thirteen Syrian opposition activists were killed during a daring and chaotic attempt to smuggle four foreign journalists out of a besieged Homs neighborhood, human rights groups said Tuesday, illuminating the risks taken by the networks that routinely ferry injured people out of stricken Syrian cities.
Syrian security forces ambushed the group, which included about 40 activists as well as the four journalists, overnight Monday as they tried to leave Baba Amr, according to the advocacy group Avaaz, which helped coordinate the rescue attempt. The neighborhood has been a center of resistance to President Bashar al-Assad and the main target of his government's efforts to quell the nearly year-long revolt.
One of the journalists, injured British photographer Paul Conroy, managed to escape and was whisked across the border to Lebanon early Tuesday after three of those accompanying him were killed, according to Avaaz.
But the ferocity of the attack scattered the rest of the group, Avaaz said. The three other journalists were forced to turn back and remain trapped in Baba Amr. Ten more activists escorting them were killed in the confused retreat into the neighborhood, which has come under sustained bombardment for the past 25 days.
The 13 were among 102 people killed across Syria on Tuesday, according to the Local Coordination Committees, a Syrian activist group. The toll included 26 who died in Baba Amr as the government continued its artillery and rocket attacks against the opposition stronghold.
In Geneva, the United Nations' political officer, B. Lynn Pascoe, said that “well over” 7,500 Syrians are now known to have been killed since the uprising began last March 15, and that an average of 100 are dying daily as the Syrian government attempts to suppress what has become the bloodiest and most intractable of all the Arab revolts.
The plight of the trapped journalists, two of whom were injured in a rocket attack on the house where they were staying last Wednesday, focused attention on the perils of reporting on the escalating violence in Syria at a time when the authorities' refusal to grant visas has prompted some journalists to sneak into the country illegally.
American correspondent Marie Colvin, who worked for Britain's Sunday Times, and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed during the bombardment last Wednesday, which came days after New York Times correspondent Anthony Shadid died of an asthma attack during a strenuous trek out of Syria across the mountainous Turkish border.
The failed rescue Tuesday also underscores the dangers facing the underground networks of activists and smugglers set up to evacuate people injured in government attacks to hospitals in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. The same networks carry medical supplies such as blood bags and antibiotics into Syria for use in field hospitals and have been used by journalists to enter the country illegally.
Similar but separate networks also have been utilized to smuggle weapons to the fledgling armed resistance movement known as the Free Syrian Army. But most of those active in the medical networks are civilian volunteers, seeking to help Syrians who have been injured during protests and who risk detention if they seek treatment at government hospitals, said Wissam Tarif, a Lebanon-based activist with Avaaz.
“They are just ordinary guys who did not pick up weapons but decided to evacuate injured people,” he said. “Some of them have basic medical training, some can do tetanus shots and provide some medical assistance. Some of them are just guys who can carry heavy weights. They've been doing this for a year, and hundreds of them have been killed.”
Tarif, who has close ties with the network, said 23 members engaged in ferrying medical supplies and injured victims between Homs and Lebanon have been killed since last Wednesday's attack on the journalists. In the process, they have evacuated 40 injured civilians from Homs.
Details of the the ambush and the identities of the dead Syrians were not disclosed to protect future evacuation operations.
With the deaths of the activists and the evident discovery of the secret route they had been using by Syrian security forces, the network is now in jeopardy, activists said, leaving it unclear whether the remaining journalists can be evacuated. Efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to negotiate safe passage out of Baba Amr for the journalists have failed.
Despite the legalization of recreational marijuana in California, delivering weed is still a risky business. Pot delivery services currently are illegal in the city of L.A. (though that's likely to change), and drivers carrying cash and cannabis could become targets for police and robbers alike.
Cannabis delivery service Eaze (which operates statewide but not in the city of L.A.) dreams of another way. Over the weekend the company demonstrated drone delivery of marijuana at the High Times Cannabis Cup in San Bernardino. Though it says the technology is perhaps years away from being put into use, the "Drone Lifted Experience" demo (see video, below) showed how simple it could be.
At the National Orange Show Events Center, Eaze had a drone lower a package into the eager hands of a participant. "The biggest takeaway from the demonstration is how technology is moving the industry forward," says Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's head of public relations. "It's not that far away."
President Donald Trump is sticking with his original statement in reaction to the Roy Moore story, although he appeared open to revisiting the situation.
“I'll stick with statement for now, but I'll have further comment as we go down the road,” Trump told reporters on Saturday on Air Force One. The president returns to the United States on Tuesday night.
Trump was repeatedly questioned about Moore by reporters traveling with him during his 10-day trip to Asia.
On Friday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in a statement that the president believed that Moore would “do the right thing” if the allegations were true.
“Like most Americans, the President believes that we cannot allow a mere allegation — in this case, one from many years ago — to destroy a person's life,” she said. “However, the President also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”
But Trump suggested he wouldn't revisit the statement until he returned to the United States.
“I have to get back into the country to see what's happening,” he said.
Trump claimed he hadn't spent much time watching television since the explosive allegations against Moore were published by the Washington Post.
“I do not watch much television … people that don't know me, they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources — you know, fake reporters, fake sources,” he said. “I read you people much more than I watch television.”
A small pool of water is surrounded by dried and cracked earth that was the bottom of the Almaden Reservoir on January 28, 2014 in San Jose, California.
California farmers will receive almost no federal water to combat what has been an extremely dry year in the drought-plagued state, a U.S. water agency announced Friday.
The low allocation comes at a time when the Sierra Nevada is historically dry and snow-water content throughout California stands at 29 percent of average for this time of year.
Michael L. Connor, commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, said the agency was looking for long-term solutions to provide relief for California's water needs.
“This low allocation is yet another indicator of the impacts the severe drought is having on California communities, agriculture, businesses, power, and the environment,” Connor said in a statement. “We will monitor the hydrology as the water year progresses and continue to look for opportunities to exercise operational flexibility in future allocations.”
But that wasn't enough for California Farm Bureau Federation President Paul Wenger, who said the low allocation and current water crisis is a direct result of failed policies at the state and federal levels.
"As the saying goes, you reap what you sow, and our state and federal governments have failed miserably at providing the resources and infrastructure to adapt to changing climatic conditions," Wenger said in a statement. “The extensive investments farmers and urban residents have made to increase water efficiency have not shielded us from this disaster-despite 20-plus years of assurances from environmental activists that all we needed to do was to conserve."
Water allocations are determined by runoff water levels, which have been depleted due to the unusually dry year.
The Reclamation bureau announced earlier this month that $14 million would be provided to water districts to help improve water management. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency on Jan. 17.

(MOUNT HOLLY, N.C.) — A group of golfers in Mount Holly, North Carolina, got the surprise of a lifetime on Wednesday when a door panel from a passing plane crashed onto the green, authorities said.
The panel, approximately 15 inches wide, landed at Green Meadows Golf Course around 8:20 a.m., according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
It was dislodged from American Airlines Flight 1910 as the plane approached Charlotte Douglas International Airport, according to the FAA.
“A golfer called the Federal Aviation Administration and reported that the panel fell,” the agency said in a statement. “The FAA is investigating.”
No injuries were reported and the plane, an Airbus 312, landed safely a short time later, according to the FAA.

Following the April demonstrations in Washington for campaign finance and voting rights reform, BillMoyers.com has invited activists — some of whom participated in the protests and some who did not — to describe what they are doing to continue work on these issues. This essay from Represent.Us is part of that series.
America is in the midst of a grassroots revolution. Ordinary people are standing up to big money and denouncing the culture of corruption that permeates our political system. Just this month, more than 1,200 people were arrested and sent to jail for protesting special interests and lobbyists. Thousands more joined anti-corruption rallies in communities across America to demand a government that represents us.
We've witnessed the revolution firsthand at Represent.Us. In fact, we're helping to foster it. Since we launched in 2012, we've brought together more than 500,000 people — progressives, conservatives and everyone in between — to fix our corrupt political system.
We're going around Congress and fixing corruption ourselves.
Represent.Us members are tired of waiting for Congress to do something. By refusing to combat corruption, our representatives have proven they are perfectly comfortable letting special interests bankroll their campaigns and write our laws. So instead of relying on politicians, we're going around Congress to fix corruption ourselves. We're passing transformative anti-corruption acts that put regular Americans back at the heart of the political process. And we're doing it with the ballot – no politicians required.
Each of these is based on the American Anti-Corruption Act, a piece of model legislation developed by some of the smartest anti-corruption advocates around. They include Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig, former Federal Election Commission Chairman Trevor Potter and even infamous former lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
The American Anti-Corruption Act does three things. First, it stops political bribery by making it illegal for lobbyists to simultaneously lobby politicians and donate to their campaigns. Second, it ends secret money so voters know who is paying for political power. And third, it empowers everyday Americans with a small donor system, giving us a real voice in our elections. We've created a five-minute animated video to explain how it all works.
Not only do anti-corruption acts combat the growing influence of lobbyists in our states, but their innovative small-donor systems will help us populate Congress with a new breed of politician dedicated to fixing our corrupt political system for good.

Here's the best part: we're already winning. In 2014, voters in Tallahassee, Florida, made history by approving the first city anti-corruption act by an overwhelming 2-to-1 margin. The unlikely coalition behind the bill included leaders from the tea party network and Florida Common Cause. They put aside their partisan differences to wage a historic battle against corruption in their community – and won.
And it's not just Tallahassee. Last November, voters in the city of Seattle, Washington, enacted a similar reform. Ten other cities have approved anti-corruption resolutions – including one in South Brunswick, New Jersey, just two weeks ago.
The list of places where we've scored political wins on this issue demonstrates that this revolution isn't a pipe dream.
It's happening right now.
This November, special interests had better watch out.
This November will mark a watershed for our movement. We're working to get anti-corruption acts on the ballot in multiple states, and will have more to say about that soon. In 2018, we believe even more states will pass these powerful reforms – and before you know it, America's political map will be blanketed in victories.
To be sure, special interests and lobbyists will not sit idly by as our movement strips them of their political power. Secret money groups will almost certainly funnel millions into opposition campaigns in a concerted effort to keep us down.
But it's one of those beautiful paradoxes of history that grassroots revolutions always seem to face insurmountable odds – until we surmount them. Ordinary people look weak in the face of concentrated power – until we unite and win.
So this November, special interests had better watch out. The anti-corruption movement is coming – and we're not stopping until we've saved our republic. Get ready.
If I had to pick one of my favorite things about being in college, it would definitely be my sorority. I really, really love it. I feel pride and happiness when I get to say, “I'm a [redacted].” Unfortunately, I don't feel like the majority of the girls in my house feel proud or happy that I am allowed to utter that sentence. Don't get me wrong; my pledge class is the best. Unlike many pledge classes, we actually all get along and they have been very accepting of me despite the fact that I am a year older than the majority of them. (I rushed as a sophomore.) The pledge classes above me, however, has never given me the time of day. To be honest, I'm not quite sure if most of them know I exist. But the ones who do definitely don't act like it–even my big.
Before you jump to conclusions, no, I am not a loser, a freak, a prude, or a crazy drunk. Seriously, I am normal. I'm an A student, but I don't spend every minute doing homework or studying. There are few things that I value more than friendship–I have a lot of friends both in my pledge class and outside of my sorority. I go out and have fun (yes, I drink) but I have never been sent to standards for being a sloppy mess. I've never hooked up with anyone's boyfriend or crush. I have been dating my boyfriend since high school, and no, I'm not one of those annoying girls who spends every second with her man. We go to different schools. I am definitely not bitchy, stuck up, or judgmental. I have a job, I work hard, and my parents don't pay for everything. I do answer to the big man upstairs, but I don't push my religious views onto anyone.
So why do I feel like many of the older girls in my chapter think of me as an embarrassment to the house? Why am I not in one single picture on our chapter's Tumblr page or Instagram account? Why do I have a feeling that my name will appear on the list of girls who will sit in the basement during recruitment stalking Facebook profiles instead of chatting with PNMs?
The answer: I'm overweight.
Again, do not jump to conclusions. I'm not obese and most people wouldn't label me “fat.” To give you an idea, I am about 15 or 20 pounds heavier than what I would like to be. The past two years have been extremely tough on me emotionally due to family issues and school stress, so I gained weight. Of course, this upsets me. No one wants to be overweight. However, it's not the being overweight issue that makes me feel ashamed; it's the way that many of my own sisters treat me (or don't treat me) because of it.
I know that there will definitely be people who read this article and think, “There is no way that that's the reason some girls don't seem to like her. There has to be some other explanation.” Don't you think I wish there was some other reason This would be so much easier for me to deal with if I was hard to get along with, was a perpetual liar, had the most obnoxious voice on the planet, or something like that–but that isn't the case. I've gotten the judgmental stares. I've overheard a few comments. “Yeah, she's put on a few pounds.” Or, even better, one girl in the pledge class above me saw me at the rec one day and actually said, “Oh, hey, I didn't know you work out.” And then there are the girls who ignore me. They were the ones who “oohed” and “aahed” at the beautiful, thin, perfectly put together girls in my pledge class as they fought over them when it was time to pick littles. They are the ones who didn't go out of their way to welcome me into the chapter, get to know me, or acknowledge me when they see me out or on campus.
I know there are some more people reading this going, “Okay, relax dude. You got into the house for a reason, so clearly people like you.” Yes, true, I got a bid for a reason. My chapter is exactly where I belong. Obviously, there are girls in my house who don't treat me this way, and I absolutely love them for that.
I did not write this article for a pity party. I don't need our publicity chair to post a solo shot of me on one of our social media sites to make me feel beautiful. I know that I am a beautiful person, both inside and out, regardless of the number on the scale. Instead, I wrote this article for any sorority woman out there who has ever judged one of her own sisters for her weight. This is your wake-up call.
I have always preferred to be positive and look at the bigger picture in life. I know that the girls who didn't take the time to get to know me just because of my weight aren't girls I want to be friends with anyway. Gaining weight is a part of life, and I will hit the gym and lose it–no big deal. But what about those girls who are more sensitive to mean comments than I am? What about the girls who don't have supportive friends or a great guy in their life to tell them they are beautiful no matter what? What about the girls who are secretly struggling with eating disorders, depression, or something equally serious? What about them?
She WILL notice when you stare at her–she put that tank top on this morning, so she's well aware of the fact it fits a little tighter than it used to. She WILL feel your judging her when you watch her eat that second cookie, and she WILL hear about the comment you made about it. (News flash, people: you can't expect to live in a house with 50 or more girls and never have someone overhear your conversation or not have another girl go behind your back and repeat what you said.) The bad part is that you have NO IDEA how it will affect her. You've heard the moral of this story before. Until you walk a mile in her shoes, you can't judge her. Life, especially during the college years, can be really hard. Cut each other some slack.
You don't have to like every girl in your house, but that doesn't mean you get to be rude. Stop judging and making bitchy comments. Compliment your sisters and be encouraging. If you notice that she has lost a few pounds, tell her she looks great. Go with her if you see her leaving for the rec or going outside for a run. This also applies outside the realm of weight loss. If you see a sister dressed up today, tell her she looks cute. Be supportive. Be there for each other. Be the kind of sister you are supposed to be.
Cape Town - The African National Congress's sub-committee on international relations has reaffirmed the party's resolution to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The ANC's various NEC sub-committees have been meeting this week in the run-up to the party's national elective conference, which commences next Saturday.
Deputy minister of Public Service and Administration Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba on Wednesday said the IR sub-committee reaffirmed the party's 2015 resolution to withdraw from the ICC.
READ: ICC no longer useful - ANC
"Furthermore, South Africa must ratify the Malabo Protocol on Amendments to the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of Justice and Human Rights... and encourage the speedy operationalisation of the African Court of Human and People's Rights."
The proposed African court is seen as a possible replacement for the ICC for African countries, many of which have accused the international body of bias.
Cabinet withdrew its original notice of intention to withdraw from the ICC in March, after the North Gauteng high court in Pretoria ruled that the decision to withdraw unilaterally was invalid.
READ: ICC withdrawal 'unconstitutional and invalid', high court rules
Opposition parties had argued in court that the process should go through Parliament, not Cabinet.
The sub-committee said in June that talks around a new process were ongoing.
Zimbabwe, Morocco, Western Sahara
Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba also read out some of the sub-committee's other key resolutions.
On Zimbabwe, they supported the peaceful transition of power and congratulated the country's citizens for having exercised restraint in the midst of "an extremely turbulent and fluid political situation".
With regards to Morocco and Western Sahara, it resolved to "remain committed to the course of Western Sahara," and believed Morocco's readmission to the AU should "serve as a catalyst and not a stumbling block".
"The position of the ANC still stands. We have reiterated that we support the struggle of the people of Western Sahara for self-determination," said Miriam Segabutla, another member of the sub-committee.
"We will continue to engage Morocco to respect the United Nations resolution on Western Sahara... but specifically within AU processes."
Brexit, xenophobia, UN
The conference recommended that a coherent communication strategy be developed to tackle xenophobia.
"Such a message should assist South African society to distinguish between xenophobic attitudes/behaviour and criminality, that seek to conceal itself by taking advantage of such attitudes."
The sub-committee also wishes to see no interruption in trade with the United Kingdom once it exits the European Union, its seventh biggest trade partner.
South Africa would also continue to campaign for the reform of the United Nations, especially the Security Council and the Bretton Wood Institutions.
The country would continue to monitor and help co-ordinate programmes in the African Union's 2063 agenda, the continent's 50-year growth plan.
It would also support projects for the yet-to-be-established BRICS bank.
Lastly, like Western Sahara, it also renewed its commitment to support a two-state solution in the decades-long Israel-Palestine conflict.

I defend this country…I defend those rights for you. -Cop, before arresting guy walking home.
It's October 2013 and a man is walking home down a picturesque road. He is being watched. He is being followed. This is evidenced by the police dashcam video that was finally released.
When he gets stopped by an officer for “suspicious activity” he doesn't just shrug and leave it at that. He morphs into assertive overdrive. He knows the law and his rights, even though the officer claims otherwise.
WATCH
The officer demands the pedestrian's identification on the claim of suspicious activity. He follows the man, saying repeatedly that yes, it is his business.
The cop projects everything he is doing onto his prey. Stop escalating, he warns. And, you are acting suspicious right now. A second cop arrives to interrogate even after the man provides information to quell any suspicions of criminal activity. When they can't arrest him for acting suspicious or not giving ID, voila! they pull something else out of their bag-o-charges.
The escalation of the cop and ensuing arrest resulted in damages awarded to the arrested man. At his request, the town's entire police department was to undergo more training on “Terry Stops” (described as proper search and seizure).
So much for, “I defend this country…I defend those rights for you,” as the cop claims, and “I'm not doing anything that's illegal.”
Volume begins at about one minute when the vehicle lights activate the dashcam recorder. There is no editing aside from the typed narration.
Terry Stops, which can include frisks and light searches of duffel bags, etc, are enacted when there is “reasonable suspicion” versus probable cause.
From Terry vs Ohio (1968):
Where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous, …he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.
Guy walking home with grocery bag? Not exactly the adrenalin-inducing suspicion better placed towards a man who just pulled off an armed bank job.
According to YouTube poster, Michael Wright, the arrest led to legal financial settlement in the unidentified rural, New England town.
No trial. No jury. And of course, no admission of guilt on the part of the officer involved or the department.

Froslass displaying her moveset; three of her moves have been partially depleted in battle, while one move still retains all of its PP.
Power Points (Japanese: パワーポイント Power Points), or PP for short, are the energy that a Pokémon requires in order to perform a move.
In the games
Power Points have existed in every generation. It costs 1 PP to use a move (barring the influence of the Pressure Ability), so the PP a move has remaining is essentially equivalent to the number of times that move can be used. Each move is assigned a base PowerPoint value that is either 1 or a positive multiple of 5, up to 40. In general, weaker moves learned at lower levels will have higher PP, while more powerful moves or moves learned at higher levels will have lower PP. PP can be fully restored by healing one's Pokémon at a Pokémon Center, and effectively act as a method to encourage players to use them even if they take little or no damage.
When a move is learned, including through methods such as using TMs or HMs, its PP will automatically be set to the base PP value, allowing it to be used immediately. However, in Generation V only, when a move is replaced with a TM or HM move, the new move's remaining PP will be set to the remaining PP of the replaced move (unless the new move's base PP is lower). This was to prevent TMs and HMs from being a method to repeatedly replenish PP at no cost, as TMs were first made reusable in that generation. In Generation VI, this behavior was reverted, and using a TM or HM to overwrite a move will set the newly learned move to its usual base PP though TMs and HMs are still reusable.
When the PP of a move has been depleted, the Pokémon will no longer be able to use that move until PP is restored. When all of a Pokémon's moves' PP have been depleted, ordering it to attack will result in the Pokémon using Struggle, a move that deals great damage to itself and minimal damage to the opponent.
All moves that target a Pokémon with Pressure use two PP per use instead of one, causing them to deplete their PP faster. A move that has only 1 PP remaining will execute as normal in these situations. Moves that do not target the Pokémon with Pressure, such as status moves which target the user, deplete as normal. Pressure will also not activate if the Pokémon with Pressure targets itself.
A move that can be used outside of battle, such as Dig or one of the many HM moves, will be able to be used outside of battle regardless of its PP on the field, and will not subtract PP for its overworld uses.
Upon using Transform, all copied moves will have 5 PP (unless the maximum PP is less than 5, in which case the PP will be that lower maximum).
Some moves, especially the Shadow moves of Pokémon Colosseum and XD, have no PP value, giving them effectively infinite PP.
In Generation I, all AI opponents have unlimited PP.
Increasing PP
All moves, except those which have a base PP of 1, can have their usability increased using a PP Up or PP Max. PP Ups boost the move's PP by 20% of the original value per PP Up, and can be used up to three times on the same move. PP Maxes boost a move's PP by 60% of the original value and can only be used once, counting as 3 PP Ups. If a PP Max is used on a move that has already been boosted by a PP Up, it will boost the PP to whatever the maximum would be, serving as two PP Ups if one has already been used, and as one if two have been.
Restoration
PP can be restored using several items. An Ether restores 10 PP for one move, a Max Ether fully restores PP for one move, an Elixir restores 10 PP for all of a Pokémon's moves, and a Max Elixir fully restores PP for all of a Pokémon's moves. Additionally, the Leppa Berry restores 10 PP for one move. In Generation II, Sacred Ash fully restores the PP of all Pokémon in the party.
Healing at a Pokémon Center (or any similar party-healing service) fully restores the PP of all party Pokémon's moves; from Generation II onward, any Pokémon deposited in the PC has the PP of all of its moves fully restored.
A Pokémon switched in after a Pokémon has used Lunar Dance will have its PP fully restored.
Base value alteration
In Generations I and II, the maximum PP of a move that began at 40 PP would be 61, likely due to a lack of data space; this is fixed from Generation III onward, increasing the maximum to its 'proper' value of 64.
Between Generations, the base PP of several moves, such as Recover and Giga Drain, was altered. If PP Ups had been used on one of these moves in a previous, this is carried over to later Generation, with the PP Ups now boosting based on the new value, rather than the old. For example, a Pokémon with Giga Drain with 2 PP Ups used on it in Generation III, having 7 PP for that move, would have 14 PP when transferred to Generation IV.
Glitches
A notable glitch found in Generation I allowed struggling to be avoided by allowing the game to self-select a move to be used, which could happen to any move used immediately after a Pokémon was defrosted, or due to a handful of moves' effects (Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Hyper Beam, Metronome, Mimic, and Wrap) because of the auto-selection involved with partial trapping moves. A move used with 0 PP in this way would underflow to the maximum possible value, 63 PP, and, due to the way the data is structured, a move that 0 PP Ups had been used on would gain full PP Up status, while those on which PP Ups had been used would lose one PP Up boost. This glitch was addressed in Generation II games and later, which prevent a move from being executed as well as selected if it has 0 PP.
In the anime

Unlike other stats, PP has not been directly referenced in the anime. However, many Pokémon have been seen to have trouble using a specific move repeatedly, such as Ash's Pikachu's increasing weakness using Thunderbolt on Mewtwo's Poké Balls as they chased him down in Mewtwo Strikes Back.
Additionally, Pokémon get visibly exhausted over the course of a battle, even if they don't take any hits. In Promoting Healthy Tangrowth!, Brock even straight out said that there is a limit to how many times Ash's Grotle would be able to use Synthesis.
In the manga

In the Pokémon Adventures manga
While PP is almost never mentioned by name in Pokémon Adventures, the effect of losing all PP of a move has been displayed a number of times:
Trivia
As shown in several Capsule Monsters sketches, Pokémon were originally planned to have a stat called TP, presumably short for Technique Points, with each move requiring a certain amount of TP to use.

PHILADELPHIA — A brief mention at a Jewish gathering on July 26 demonstrated how fast and dramatic the fall was for the Democrat Party's top Jewish official.
“I'd like to applaud Debbie Wasserman Schultz,” New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler said as he opened his speech at a Jewish roundtable discussion on the sidelines of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. But thanks to the damaging leak of thousands of internal party emails, instead of the automatic round of applause, the room fell silent. Just a handful of the more than 200 Jewish activists present clapped in support.
In many ways, Wasserman Schultz embodied the enormous influence that American Jews have within the Democratic Party. A Jew with deep communal involvements, she was a key pillar of support for the mainstream pro-Israel lobby in Congress and within the party. As both chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a member of Congress sitting on the powerful House Committee on Appropriations — a panel that votes on all major government expenditures — Wasserman Schultz was at the nexus of U.S. policy, politics and political fundraising in a way that few others matched.
Still, in the wake of her fall, most Jewish Democrats dismissed that it portended any decrease in American Jewry's strong presence in the party as politicians, activists and donors.
“Jews and the Democratic Party? We have no problem,” New York City Council member David Greenfield said. “People don't think of it in that way in the Democratic Party.”
Until just before the Philadelphia convention began, Wasserman Schultz was supposed to be the busiest person in it. But instead of running the Democratic Party's biggest show, she was nowhere to be found. Keeping a low profile after she was forced out of her position as chair of the DNC following a WikiLeaks email hack, Wasserman Schultz refrained from attending public events and avoided the media.
Her departure left the community with mixed feelings: sympathy for the plight of a well-appreciated Jewish politician who had successfully combined Jewish communal involvement with local and national politics, alongside anger at her conduct as DNC chair and relief at her decision to step down.
“I think it's unfair that she's gone, but this is a difficult situation that could have created a distraction,” said Marc Stanley, former chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council. “For her sake, I'm glad she's not the punching bag for the rest of the week.”
On July 25, a group of Wasserman Schultz's supporters, many of them prominent Jewish backers from southern Florida, threw a lunch in her honor. It was a welcome respite from recent days' turmoil, and it came only hours after she got booed in a breakfast meeting with her own state delegation.
“People wanted to show their appreciation,” one participant at the event said. “Some of them felt bad that she had to take the fall” for the DNC being biased against the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and in favor of Hillary Clinton during the primary season.
But others felt it was not a minute too soon.
According to press reports, John Podesta, chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign, asked for Wasserman Schultz's removal months ago but was blocked by President Obama, who did not want to draw negative attention to the party.
“Leaving her [in place] would have created a distraction,” said Stosh Cotler, CEO of Bend the Arc, a Jewish progressive organization focused on domestic policy. “It's important that this convention and this moment not be sidetracked by the unfortunate circumstance that led to the departure of Debbie Wasserman Schultz.”
Instead, Wasserman Schultz was kicked out of her post as chair a week after a WikLeaks dump of 3,000 emails from DNC staff members revealed an ingrained and institutionalized bias within the committee, which was supposed to be neutral, against Sanders.
Especially damning was an email suggesting that Sanders's religious beliefs could be raised to weaken his support among Christian voters. The email proposed putting out the idea that Sanders, a Jew who does not actively participate in Jewish communal life, is an atheist.
This specific email “really turned my stomach, and I don't want that type of mentality,” Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen said. The Jewish congressman from Memphis called for the firing of DNC staffers behind the offensive email, saying they “crossed the line.”
Facing mounting pressure, and after speaking to Obama and Democratic presidential candidate Clinton, Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation July 24, less than 24 hours before she was scheduled to gavel in the party's national convention. Sanders had demanded her firing for months, claiming that under Wasserman Schultz, the party did not maintain impartiality and could not appeal to progressives and liberals.
Wasserman Schultz represented a strongly pro-Israel line within the Democratic Party that objects to American pressure on Israel over its conflict with the Palestinians and puts much of the blame for lack in progress toward peace on the Palestinian side. This was one of the points of contention between the DNC and Sanders, who tried to push the party to adopt a platform that acknowledges the rights of Palestinians.
At the end of the process, the Clinton-DNC line prevailed, leaving most of the platform plank on Israel untouched. The committee in charge of the party's platform rejected attempts to refer to Israel's rule over the West Bank as an “occupation,” or to criticize Israel's policies of expanding the presence of exclusively Jewish settlements there.
“Look at the final result of the platform language,” Clinton's Jewish outreach director Sarah Bard, told a supporter who expressed concerns over a perceived leftward tilt on the issue of Israel.
For Jewish Democrats preparing for the general election, the need to move past the email scandal and mend fences with Sanders was urgent, as they presented what they see as a real danger to the community if Democrats lose the elections and Donald Trump becomes the next president. “He is so far away from the norm,” Colorado Rep. Jared Polis said at a Jewish roundtable discussion, referring to Trump. “It should be scary not only to the Jewish community but to all Americans.”
Polis, like other Jewish Democrats, is pinning his hopes on Jews on the other side of the political divide taking a principled position against their candidate. “We have a unique opportunity with our Republican brothers and sisters to ensure they don't support this nominee,” he said. “This nominee is beyond the pale.”
While most focused on the Democratic inner debate that flared up following the email disclosure, some looked at the motivation behind WikiLeaks' decision to publish the leaks on the eve of the Democratic convention and at the potential involvement of the Russian government in hacking the DNC email accounts.
While the Obama administration was investigating a link to the Russian government, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called on Russia to hack more of Clinton's emails.
WikiLeaks' founder, Julian Assange, made no secret of his hope that, by damaging Democratic party unity, the email leak will harm Clinton, whom he views as a personal foe and a “problem for freedom of the press.” He also cited Clinton's foreign policy positions, excoriating her as “a liberal war hawk.”
Some were left wondering if Clinton's adamant support for Israel was part of what Assange had in mind after WikiLeaks posted a tweet hinting that critics of the organization were Jewish. The tweet raised concerns about anti-Semitism in the group's work.
As for Wasserman Schultz, she will return from Philadelphia to a primary race in Florida that has just become more challenging.
Her rival, progressive Democrat Tim Canova, whom Sanders endorsed, intends to file a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission based on the WikiLeaks emails. According to Canova, who will face off with Wasserman Schultz on August 30, the emails allegedly show that the DNC chair used party resources for her own primary race.

Being the frontman of a rock band can provide you with plenty of opportunities, including financial ones. Some rockers have benefitted more than others over the years, and Celebrity Net Worth has compiled a list of the richest rock singers, with Dave Grohl , James Hetfield , and Axl Rose among those doing well.
The site compiled their list using publicly available information on salaries, real estate holdings, divorces, and endorsements as well as record sales and royalties. They then worked out a formula that subtracts taxes, manager's fees, agents' fees, and lifestyle to come up with their final estimate.
As expected, the rockers that have been doing it the longest have amassed the biggest fortunes, with Paul McCartney leading the way at $800 million, followed by Bono at an estimated $600 million. Hard rock fans have to scroll all the way down to No. 11 on the list to find Foo Fighters singer and former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, who was estimated at earning $225 million.
The next highest hard rock vocalist is Metallica 's James Hetfield, who reportedly netted $175 million, good enough to place him at No. 17. Following closely behind is Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose, who is worth $150 million, which lands him at No. 19.
Other hard rock vocalists of note inside the Top 50 include: Red Hot Chili Peppers ' Anthony Kiedis at No. 25 with $125 million; Iron Maiden 's Bruce Dickinson at No. 28 with $115 million; AC/DC 's Brian Johnson at No. 30, tied with Black Sabbath 's Ozzy Osbourne with $95 million; Pearl Jam 's Eddie Vedder at No. 34 with $80 million; and Soundgarden 's Chris Cornell at No. 48 with $60 million.
Aside from McCartney and Bono, the rest of the Top 10 includes Jimmy Buffett ($400 million), Elton John ($320 million), Mick Jagger ($305 million), Gene Simmons ($300 million), Sting ($290 million), Phil Collins ($250 million), Dave Matthews ($250 million), and Prince ($250 million).
President Donald Trump will head to Harrisburg, Pa., on Wednesday to speak to a handpicked crowd of truckers, state lawmakers and manufacturers regarding his much anticipated tax reform plan.
Roughly 1,000 individuals were invited to attend the speech, which will take place inside a hangar at an Air National Guard base and feature actual trucks surrounding the president. PennLlive.com reported.
The president is expected to use the platform to address his proposal of eliminating the estate tax, which he and some congressional Republicans claim will provide relief for small business owners, as the tax causes “hell” and forces them out of business, the Hill reported.
Trump also will likely introduce people in the crowd as living examples to illustrate his view that the estate tax negatively affects families, PennLive.com reported.
However, the Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation argues abolishing the estate tax, also known as the “death tax,” would mainly benefit the wealthy, as only 0.2 percent of Americans pay estate tax. One-percenters pay 27 percent of the total, the Hill reported.
Trump also will devote a significant portion of his speech to truckers, a “major beneficiary” of the tax plan, which proposes to lower the corporate tax rate to around 20 percent, although Trump hopes to see that number at 15 percent, a senior White House official told PennLive.com.
The tax alleviation would also allow manufacturers to spend more on production, thus providing truckers with more driving opportunities.
In addition, Republican lawmakers are also looking to reframe the current individual tax rate, from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, as well as simplify the complex tax code, and “deliver the lowest tax rates on businesses in modern history," Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, head of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill.
Not much detail has been revealed about one of Trump's most sought-after campaign promises, which has become front and center following Republicans' several failed attempts to repeal and replace ObamaCare.
Meanwhile, Fox News' Sean Hannity will have an exclusive sitdown interview with the president in Pennsylvania ahead of his speech Wednesday evening. Their conversation will cover everything from tax reform to trending news topics, as well as Trump's 70-point immigration plan.

Five years from now, the raw materials China needs to make the latest gadgets, carpets and furniture could pass through the Port of Tacoma.
A Northwest Innovation Works plant will convert natural gas delivered to the site by underground pipe into methanol. From there, the colorless, flammable liquid will travel in a tanker ship across the Pacific Ocean to a plant in China.
There, the methanol will be converted to olefin, a plastic-like substance that can be used to craft a variety of products. Some of the objects — cellphones, furniture and carpet — will end up back in the United States, possibly even through the Port of Tacoma.
But before the methanol starts that journey, its production will use a lot of electricity and water.

Northwest Innovation Works officials have told Tacoma Public Utilities that at full production the plant would require 400 megawatts, the equivalent of powering approximately 300,000 to 400,000 average homes in the U.S., according to the National Hydropower Association.
The plant also could use 14.4 million gallons of water per day — enough to supply nearly 77,500 homes, according to TPU figures on household water use.
Northwest Innovation Works signed a long-term lease last year with the Port of Tacoma for the former Kaiser Aluminum smelter property. The smelter halted work more than a dozen years ago. The port bought the plant, razed it and cleaned up the site near the head of the Blair Waterway.
It's good for jobs; it's good for the port's finances. It looks to be a very safe use of the property. Port of Tacoma commissioner Connie Bacon in 2014
“I think it's just a wonderful proposal,” said Tacoma Port Commissioner Connie Bacon in 2014. “It's good for jobs; it's good for the port's finances. It looks to be a very safe use of the property.”
On the eve of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit in September, the plant's promoters announced it would double its manufacturing lines from two to four.
The $3.4 billion project will create 1,000 jobs during peak construction and an estimated 260 permanent placements for workers in the region, company spokeswoman Charla Skaggs said.
The company is seeking to build methanol plants at two other Northwest ports — the Port of St. Helens and the Port of Kalama. Of those, the Kalama project is furthest along with Tacoma next in line.
Financial backers of the Kalama and Tacoma projects include the Chinese government and British Petroleum.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
Olefin manufacturers once made methanol primarily from coal, but recently began transitioning to natural gas. The newer process reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent, Skaggs said.
China recognizes the need to reduce its reliance on coal, Skaggs said, and the growing demand for olefins. Natural gas is abundant and inexpensive in North America. Skaggs said creating methanol here for export to China is an “economically viable process.”
The plants planned in Washington reduce greenhouse gas emissions further by using technology called ULE, or “ultra-low emissions,” Skaggs said.
While many natural-gas-to-methanol plants burn natural gas for the heat required in the manufacturing process, the Tideflats facility will instead tie into the Tacoma Power electric grid, Skaggs said. That choice will lower emissions of greenhouse gasses even further. This ULE technology reduces greenhouse gas output by a further 70 percent, she said, and the company incorporated it after the Kalama community said greenhouse gas emissions were a concern.
But such precautions haven't been enough to assure everyone that the plant will be a good neighbor.
David Mueller, whose property on Browns Point Boulevard overlooks the Port of Tacoma, said he and his wife, Pam, moved here about six years ago to retire.
“We are fortunate to find such a beautiful place to live,” Mueller said. “I see so much potential in Tacoma.”
But the couple is wary of the plant's effect on Tacoma and the environment. They worry the plant will add pollutants to the air and water.
“We have a lot of history in this town of having polluting industries,” Mueller said. “We got rid of Asarco and refurbished the area into something that people are proud of. Then we turn around and build a plant that's going to be a polluter.”

The nonprofit environmental group Citizens for a Healthy Bay are closely watching the process for the proposed plant. Executive Director Melissa Malott said the group is “neutral but concerned.”
Malott said the nonprofit has met with the company twice, and is waiting to hear more definitive plans for the methanol plant's water use. How much will it actually use? What will happen to the water after it's used to cool the manufacturing process?
Wastewater from the plant would be “extremely warm,” she said. Plus the drain on the region's water supply could be a concern. “Because of climate change, we have a water-uncertain future,” Malott said, referring to a report released last month by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group.
Eric de Place, policy director of Seattle-based advocacy group Sightline Institute, said he is skeptical of the company's claims. His organization has issued a couple of reports questioning whether methanol plants are good for the Northwest, but hasn't come to any firm conclusions.
“Every fossil fuel project that comes to the Northwest sells itself as a clean-energy solution,” de Place said last week. “It hasn't checked out in the past. Maybe it does for this one.”

Skaggs said the company will comply with all environmental regulations. The plant has support from Washington's green governor, Jay Inslee, who last year hailed it as “another milestone for our state's clean-energy future.”
“Washington state is working to turn the global challenge of carbon pollution into new jobs and strong communities,” Inslee said in a news release. “This project at the former Kaiser site will boost our regional economy while eventually providing a needed supply of clean methanol fuel to Asia.”
UTILITY REQUIREMENTS
The plan will require a lot of power — up to 450 megawatts at its peak. Tacoma Power's entire customer base used 543 megawatts on average in 2014.
Those customers use most of the city's power supply, so almost all of the electricity for Northwest Innovation Works will have to be bought from outside sources.
Tacoma Public Utilities Director Bill Gaines said in October that TPU will act as a power “aggregator,” buying power on the open market to supply Northwest Innovation Works' needs.
But buying power that way comes at a cost and can be more expensive than the power a utility creates for itself. Gaines said that although the utility can spread that cost among all of its customers, he would recommend the new business pay for the increased cost.
“That's going to be our recommendation to find a way not to put the current customers at risk,” Gaines said.
At the same time, the city should have no trouble serving the plant's water needs, utility officials say.
14.4 million gallons of water per day the methanol plant could use when in full production by late 2021
The methanol plant's use could be as high as 10,000 gallons per minute, Skaggs said, or 14.4 million gallons per day. That's about two-thirds of what Tacoma Water's residential customers together used in 2014 and nearly as much as the 16.6 million gallons of water per day the WestRock paper mill (formerly Simpson Tacoma Kraft) consumed.
Tacoma Water's primary source is the Green River watershed, which experienced its driest year on record this year. But the utility also has the right to use several wells, which alone can provide up to 143 million gallons of water per day.
That apparently hasn't stopped city officials from looking for ways to reduce the draw on Tacoma Water's supply. City Manager T.C. Broadnax said in October that the city is exploring whether the company could use treated wastewater for part of its water needs.
PUBLIC PROCESS COULD TAKE MONTHS
No permits have been filed for the company's Tacoma location so far, but a timeline on its website suggests construction could begin in late 2017 and last four years. The company hopes the first phase of the plant would be operational in 2020.
The state designated the city of Tacoma as the lead agency for permitting last month. Nearby property owners, neighborhood groups and some city residents could see a city mailing in early December inviting public comment for the project, said principal planner Shirley Schultz. A public meeting could be held as early as January.
A city consultant will draft an Environmental Impact Statement for public review and comment as early as next summer. The EIS can include details about the project's environmental impacts, job creation and tax revenues, costs to area neighborhoods, traffic counts, human health affects and more.
I think the methanol plant is something that requires thoughtful and careful scrutiny. Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland
The company will eventually have to say how it will address, minimize or mitigate concerns. One recent example of such mitigation is Puget Sound Energy's pledge to pay $5.5 million to rebuild a road to heavy-haul standards and renovate a vacant Tideflats fire station to help provide faster emergency response as part of building the utility's proposed liquid natural gas plant.
Once the city weighs public comments and the company revises its plans to address them, the city will file a final EIS with the Department of Ecology. Only after that step is complete can the city issue permits, Schultz said.
A separate regulatory process with opportunities for public input will happen once Northwest Innovation Works seeks permission from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a 10-mile extension to a natural gas pipeline.
“I think the methanol plant is something that requires thoughtful and careful scrutiny,” Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland said. “There will be a long and thorough process” for vetting it.

FORT GORDON, Ga. — Army psychiatrist Patrick Lillard still anguishes over that night four years ago, when a drunken soldier shot to death a sheriff's deputy along a shoulder of an expressway outside this base and then turned the assault rifle on himself.
Now Lillard has made an extraordinary decision to speak out about the case: If only the Army had listened to him, Spc. Christopher Hodges would have been in a hospital for alcohol addiction and two lives could have been saved.
Twice before the shootings, Lillard urged that Hodges, 26, an Iraq War veteran, receive at least a month of intensive treatment. Twice his recommendations were ignored by an Army substance abuse program that allows officers without a medical background to overrule a doctor.
"Two people died, and it could have been prevented," Lillard told USA TODAY. He called on the military to "step up — 'man up,' as they say in the Army — and admit this was a tragic mistake, or error, or whatever word they want to use. Take responsibility. Explain in plain language to the family of Christopher Hodges and the police officer and make sure it does not happen again."
USA TODAY reported in March that the Army's substance abuse program is in disarray, with thousands of soldiers turned away from needed treatment, dozens of suicides linked to poor care and too few qualified counselors. The Army responded to the story by ordering an ongoing investigation of all 54 substance abuse outpatient clinics.
Lillard, 74, said he chose to speak out about the Hodges case after USA TODAY's report in hopes that other lives won't be lost because soldiers are denied substance abuse treatment.
Hodges' parents and widow agreed to waive privacy protections to allow the story to be told for the first time.
Lillard resigned from the Army, effective Friday, at least in part over disagreements with the way patient care is handled.
In a statement, the Army said officials did everything they could to support Hodges "through an outpatient program that included ... abstinence from alcohol, mandatory urinalysis and breathalyzer testing, compliance with appointments and intervention such as attending weekly group counseling sessions (and) individual therapy sessions." The soldier also was sent to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and alcohol-abuse prevention training.
The Army emphasized that Hodges did not want hospitalization if it interfered with this training. However, soldiers can be compelled to undergo Army-supported treatment under penalty of separation from the service, Lillard said.
KILLING SHOCKS COMMUNITY
The early morning tragedy on Oct. 23, 2011, shook neighboring Augusta, where The Augusta Chronicle said in an editorial that the deputy's killing was "pure evil" and demanded the military explain how such a thing could happen.
In the months leading up to the shooting, Hodges was in weekly therapy at a substance abuse outpatient clinic at Fort Gordon, according to medical records. But Lillard, acting director of intensive inpatient addiction care at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Army Medical Center at the base, said the soldier needed more than outpatient therapy. He needed hospitalization and close scrutiny.
USA TODAY reported in March that the majority of Army outpatient clinics are operating far below professional standards for treating drug and alcohol abuse. But the Fort Gordon clinic is among a small number that are rated the best, according to an internal assessment by the Army's senior substance abuse counselors.
Substance abuse counselors there uncovered much about what was troubling Hodges, an aviation operations specialist and Augusta native who was raised in a deeply religious Army family where everyone served, including his mom and dad.
Hodges wanted help for his alcoholism, telling therapists he was a hard drinker since age 14 and that alcohol abuse led to a perforated ulcer and emergency surgery at Fort Gordon in July 2011. Seven weeks before the shooting, the aspiring rapper showed his counselors a poetic prayer he had written that was titled, "So Scared." It read in part, "How can I lead people to Jesus, when I'm throwin' up in the sink. ... If I turn my back on (God), Satan will give me everything I've hoped for. I don't want that."
Lillard met with Hodges in August 2011 and noted that the soldier "appreciates he is into very serious health consequences with his alcohol use and is willing to do whatever is necessary. The very strong recommendation is (hospitalization)."
A month later, after Hodges relapsed, Lillard saw him again. "(He) must go to a higher level of care and he is (in) very high risk for relapse and in danger for his physical health as well," the doctor said in his notes.
But Hodges' company commander, Capt. Heath Mullins, would not allow it. Mullins later told an investigator that his decision stemmed from the fact that Hodges was a member of the Tennessee National Guard and only temporarily on active duty while attending air-traffic control training at Fort Gordon. Mullins said he thought Hodges would return to the National Guard before hospitalization could begin.
"I would have to contact the State of Tennessee for their recommendation and plan of action," he said in a sworn statement. There was no indication he tried to do so. Mullins, now a major in the Army, could not be reached for comment.
Lillard said he would have hospitalized Hodges immediately. "I'm convinced this (tragedy) wouldn't have happened," the doctor says. "I'll go to my grave believing that."
A TROUBLED SOLDIER

The depth of Hodges' distress was discovered by investigators after the shootings: how he was consumed with financial and emotional pressure going through a divorce; how family and friends were certain he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder following 15 months in Iraq at the height of that war; how he fantasized in journals about suicide and tasting "the cold steel of the barrel" in his mouth; and how he always kept close at hand an assault rifle that he had purchased.
All of it boiled over on a crisp autumn night with Hodges at the wheel of his 2004 Cadillac DeVille. according to police reports. He'd been drinking malt liquor, Jägermeister and Red Bull all night, and was bickering with his girlfriend, Raven Harper, about his intoxication — and the volume on the radio.
Hodges swerved off the expressway onto the grass, where the violence escalated, according to a report, based on what Harper told police and a recording of Harper's 911 call.
She scrambled out of the car shoeless, a white, diamond-shaped earring flying into the grass. He circled the car slowly, bumping her before stopping perpendicular to the freeway. She called 911. He yelled for her to get back in the car.
"All I know is that he's like very intoxicated and I don't know what his next move is," she told the dispatcher. "He has been overseas a couple of times and I just think that when he becomes like under the influence ... he's just back there."
As vehicles sped by, Hodges retrieved a rifle from the trunk. Harper thought she heard him praying, then fired two or three rounds at a time in the direction of passing cars, as she grew frantic.
Between her sobs and his gunfire, she pleaded into her phone, "Please send that car. Can somebody please come get me?"
Then there was a hail of gunfire, and Harper ran down the road screaming that a policeman had been shot.
DEPUTY STRUCK NINE TIMES
Richmond County Sheriff's Deputy James "J.D." Paugh, 47, was working traffic control at the county fairgrounds that night. Divorced, he loved being a motorcycle officer and the trappings it offered in a city defined by the Masters golf tournament each year.
"He could go anywhere he wanted," said his older brother, Robert, "and it also allowed him to help people. He was really there just to serve."
As he headed home in the dark that Sunday, he spotted the Cadillac in the grass. "J.D. probably thought it was a stranded motorist that needed some kind of assistance," Robert Paugh said.
Before J.D. Paugh could drop the kickstand on his police Harley-Davidson Road King, Hodges opened fire. Rounds struck the motorcycle windshield, grazed Paugh's helmet, shot away his microphone and drilled into the motor cylinder. The deputy was struck again and again. He somehow managed to pull his pistol and get off two or three shots, one bullet passing through Hodges' right forearm. At one point, Harper saw the officer crawling on the ground.
Hodges emptied a 30-round magazine, slammed in another, and nearly emptied that one. He had three bullets left when he turned the rifle around, placed the barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
In all, Paugh was struck nine times, including through the heart. He was dead by the time officers arrived.
A foundation later established to honor the dead officer has raised nearly $200,000 to purchase safety equipment for area police departments. The motorcade that followed his casket the day he was buried stretched through Augusta for several miles.
"It's a damn shame," said an emotional Robert Paugh, after learning that psychiatrist Lillard had twice urged a lengthy hospitalization for Hodges before the shooting. "To think that my brother could be alive today."
PARENTS CONDEMN ARMY LEADERSHIP
Lillard said that when he read the next morning about the deaths "I was angry to being tearful."
Last month, Christopher Hodges' parents, Fred and Elisia, met with Lillard and his wife, Nina, in Augusta for lunch. The doctor explained in detail how their son had tried so hard to get help.
Fred Hodges is a chief warrant officer class 4 in the Army. He and his wife said they took some solace from Lillard's words. "Because now I know at least (Christopher) was seeking the proper help, like I've always asked him to do," the father said, "and unfortunately the leadership and some of the policies and processes did not support him fully."
The Army colonel investigating the Hodges case in 2011 recommended that, in the future, if a psychiatrist's recommendation is overruled, the matter be taken up for higher medical and command review. The family later received a copy of that investigation. But that recommendation was blacked out.
There was no word from the Army on whether the policy change was ever implemented, but there is little evidence attitudes have changed.
In late April, commanders at Fort Gordon initially objected to enrolling a soldier into outpatient substance abuse care, despite the fact that she had fallen into a coma after a deadly mixture of alcohol and sedative medication, Lillard said. Under persistent pressure from addiction specialists, her command finally relented.
Lillard said the Army still looks upon the hard-drinking soldier as a tough stereotype, a problem that can be handled chiefly through discipline. "It's still not accepted that we're dealing with medical problems," he said, "with real disease and illnesses."

The bones of a young woman have been found in Dedham and officials are asking for the public's help in identifying her, the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office said Friday. The remains were found Tuesday by someone walking in a wooded area off High Street near the Brookdale Cemetery and the Dedham Public Works Department, according to District Attorney Michael Morrissey. The woman's remains have been there for a "significant amount of time," Morrissey said. The woman is believed to be black, in her late teens or early 20s and about 5 foot 6 inches tall. She was wearing a gray Marist College hooded sweatshirt, a bracelet with a "Peace" pendant and a ring. The woman was also wearing a pair of nondescript Atmosphere-brand sweatpants, Morrissey said. Morrissey said his investigators have been in contact with Marist and officials in the Poughkeepsie, New York, area about any possible connections.The bones were slightly scattered about the area, but a fairly full skeleton was recovered, Morrissey said. There did not appear to be any effort to bury or hide the body, but it was partially covered with some overgrowth, debris and brush.Morrissey is hopeful that investigators will be able to extract DNA from the remains. Investigators said it was too early to determine the cause or manner of death or whether foul play was involved. Anyone who has information about the case is asked to contact Dedham police at 781-751-9300 or State Police at 781-830-4990.

Despite recent signs that House Democrats will likely ultimately vote on a bill that contains retroactive immunity for the telecoms, negotiations on a final version of the surveillance bill remain ongoing. Dems, after saying that a vote might come as early as this week, now seem unclear when it might happen.
In a conference call with bloggers today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) made it clear that her highest priority for a surveillance bill was that it contain a so-called “exclusivity” provision — a measure that would explicitly state that the bill would be the “exclusive means” by which the government would conduct surveillance, or in other words, the president does not have the power to ignore the law if he/she so pleases.
“Exclusivity is the issue,” she said.
The Bush administration, which circumvented FISA to conduct its warrantless wiretapping program, does not want its hands tied. And a majority of Republicans helped vote down an exclusivity amendment offered by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in the Senate, where by bipartisan agreement, the measure required 60 votes. There is such a provision in the House's surveillance bill, which passed last year.
Pelosi says that she “absolutely” opposes retroactive immunity for the telecoms, but that she “didn't want the fight to be so focused there that we neglect exclusivity.” Pelosi added that the House leadership was “at the mercy of the 17 or 18 Democrats in the Senate who are voting with the Republicans on this” and said that “we are trying to work with the Dems in the Senate to come to an agreement” on exclusivity, immunity, and other issues.
So this will be an interesting variable to add to the mix as the bill negotiations continue. Would Republicans in the Senate support a bill that had exclusivity in it? And would the President veto a bill that had it?
Who knows what to expect with the next few films Warner Bros. has lined up for the continuation of their DC Cinematic Universe? With so much shake-up and upheaval going on in the aftermath of BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE, the only thing that seems to be for certain is that what's on the horizon won't be like Zack Snyder's most recent film. Change is definitely coming, and where we're probably going to be able to see it the most is in what James Wan is looking to execute with AQUAMAN.
Wan has talked pretty optimistically in recent months about the challenges AQUAMAN has and why he welcomes trying to tackle them, but the director didn't have to make the choice to go under the sea, so to speak. James Wan could have opted for a different project within the DCU, as he revealed to Mike Ryan at Uproxx. Wan was offered the decision to pick between AQUAMAN and THE FLASH, and we know how that process turned out.
But why? Why AQUAMAN over THE FLASH? Wan explains:
But the thing that ultimately pushed me more towards Aquaman is I love the possibility of creating a whole new world. I've always wanted to do a world creation story and visually create this amazing, incredible, magical kingdom. And also, I love the fact that Aquaman is an underdog character. I love the fact that people like to make fun of him. [Laughs.] I feel the bar is a lot lower and I can have fun with him!
Everyone makes fun of him! And I actually don't mind that! What it allows me to do: I think people are a lot less precious with him than, let's say, you were doing a Spider-Man or a Batman or whatever.
He's right... mostly. There are sure to be hardcore Aquaman enthusiasts who show up in 2018 talking about how James Wan doesn't understand Aquaman and somehow ruined their childhoods. There always are. But, for the most part, fans don't have anywhere near the same type of connection with the superhero that they do with others, and, as a result, Wan has some leeway to play within the world he's creating without having to be slavish to the source material that some will always check him against.
Plus, if he can make AQUAMAN into a character the mainstream can get excited about, then he will have done exactly what Warner Bros. asked him to do. And, if for some reason, it doesn't work, then so what? It was Aquaman. No one respects him anyway. Wan is basically playing with house money here. Let's hope he can turn it into big winnings for us all.
AQUAMAN is currently slated for a July 27, 2018 release.

Today all players have gained access to the research and purchase of the F-84G and G.56 aircraft in the Italian research tree. Many players already achieved “12 tester arrows” and received access to whole Italian research tree! From nearly facing project cancellation to becoming the primary strike fighter of the US Air Force in the Korean War, meet the definitive version of one of the first American close support aircraft of its kind that almost never came to be - The F-84G Thunderjet. History: ▼ Development of the F-84 Thunderjet project began as early as 1944, when the Republic company proposed a new turbojet fighter aircraft intended to replace the P-47 Thunderbolt in day time operations. Following its maiden flight in 1946, the F-84 was commissioned for service in 1947 and was tasked with fulfilling the fighter-bomber role. However, due to engine reliability issues and numerous structural problems, early models of the aircraft were nearly phased out of service and production after a review of the US air force deemed them incapable of performing their intended role. Despite this, Republic's engineers focused their efforts on addressing the flaws of the aircraft, determined they would get it right. A year and several variants later, in 1949, it seemed like the D model of the F-84 was finally shaping up to be the aircraft the US air force wanted. However, meeting the requirements set by the air force, making the aircraft operational, didn't mean it couldn't be improved further to perform better. Thus development on the F-84 Thunderjet continued, and in 1951, around the start of the Korean War, the definitive G variant of the F-84 was constructed. The G model brought with it an improved J35-A-29 engine, allowed for in-flight refueling and introduced an autopilot to the navigation systems. Apart from that, one of the most significant modifications made to the F-84G was the ability to carry the Mark 7 nuclear bomb, making it also the first USAF fighter-bomber capable of packing such firepower. On the other hand, the numerous performance improvements over time gave the F-84G superb handling characteristics, also making it one of the first jets to be used by USAF flight demonstration teams. The F-84G also marks the final model of the F-84 with straight wings, subsequent models were built with a swept wing design and were renamed to “Thunderstreak”. In total, around 4,500 F-84 Thunderjets were built across all its modifications. The G model made up for a considerable part of all F-84s, with approximately 3000 units built. Nearly 2000 F-84Gs were built for France, Italy, Belgium, Turkey and other NATO countries under the MDAP military assistance program. Non-NATO countries like Yugoslavia, Iran, Thailand and Taiwan also received small numbers of F-84Gs for their air forces. Thunderjets saw their peak in service with countries all over the world during the 1950s, being slowly phased out of use throughout the 60s with some countries and being completely taken out of service by the end of the 70s. In War Thunder, the F-84G was introduced in Update 1.69 “Regia Aeronautica”, as part of the new Italian aviation research tree. There, it represents the final aircraft players can get when going down the Italian attacker line. And what a magnificent attacker the F-84G is! After obtaining the corresponding secondary weapon pylons, pilots of the F-84G will be able to equip their planes with an impressive array of bombs and rockets to go with their standard six .50 caliber M3 machine guns, mounted in the nose and wing roots of the aircraft. Thanks to this overwhelming amount of firepower, players will virtually be able to take on a small army all on their own, if necessary. However, the F-84G is not just an excellent ground attacker, but also a very potent fighter if no load is attached underneath the wings. Capable of reaching speeds close to 990 km/h (615 mph) at sea level without suffering from a major loss of controllability, this speed demon is certainly one of the fastest and most formidable jet fighters at its battle rating. Download Wallpaper: 1280x1024 | 1920x1080 | 2560x1440 As with all jets, maintaining speed is key to winning single engagements, meaning that sharp turns and frequent maneuvering are best to be avoided in order to preserve speed. Conduct quick and accurate passes on your enemy, ideally from above, but never focus on a single target alone - this will ensure maximum combat efficiency and a minimal chance of getting caught off guard. Given the F-84G may often find itself fighting alongside piston engine aircraft, it's recommended for pilots to prioritise enemy jets first. This way, they'll be protecting their slower teammates by taking down the most dangerous opponents for them first and will be able to assist them in the later stage of a match in clearing out the remaining enemy force. Tell us what you think about the F-84G and share your own experiences about it with other players in the comments below. Until next time!
According to Hugh Bonneville, fans should expect to see some some tears at the final episode of "Downton Abbey." The ITV series is now filming its final season, after five seasons of depicting life in aristocratic England in the years following 1912.
In a new interview with ITV, Hugh Bonneville, who plays the Crawley patriarch the Earl of Grantham, revealed what it was like filming the show's final season.
"Series five was supposed to be the last so this one is a bonus and it feels right for the story," the actor shared. "Of course it's sad."
"We're filming the final episodes now," Bonneville added "When we finish there'll be tears."
Bonneville also dismissed the rumors that there will be a Downton Abbey spin-off show and even a movie version.
"Great idea," he began. "I think we should combine those two thoughts."
"Let's make a film set in the 1970s in which Lord Grantham wears flares and a kipper tie," the actor joke. "I can see it now."
For the record, it was "Downton Abbey" executive producer Gareth Neame who suggested that the possibility of a spin-off.
But as for "Downton Abbey" season 6 spoilers, there have been suggestions that the story could take the Crawley family to America. This notion was brought to Neame's attention during an interview with Deadline, and the producer showed enthusiasm for the idea.
"I would absolutely love to bring the Crawleys to America," Neame said. "A couple of episodes in Newport or Boston or New York, It would be a complete thrill."
This could be a storyline worth exploring, given that two of the main characters of the show were shown at the season 5 Christmas special leaving for America. Allen Leech, who plays Tom Branson, and Lily James who plays Lady Rose have left the series, to focus on their movie careers.
In any case, fans are clamoring for these two actors to return to the "Downton Abbey" set in its final season.

Harvard University does not require history majors to take a course in U.S. history. Nor do Georgetown University, the University of Maryland and many other highly regarded schools.
The American Council of Trustees and Alumni says that's a problem. The council, based in Washington, recently surveyed the requirements for history majors at top colleges and universities and concluded that too much give short shrift to the United States.
“A democratic republic cannot thrive without well-informed citizens and leaders,” said the council's president, Michael Poliakoff. “Elite colleges and universities in particular let the nation down when the examples they set devalue the study of United States history.”
The council's survey of programs at 76 highly ranked colleges and universities found that 53 do not require history students to take a course focused on the nation's history. Among the 23 that do have such a requirement were the University of California at Berkeley, the College of William & Mary, Columbia University and — not surprisingly — the U.S. Naval Academy and U.S. Military Academy.
[Service academies: Where the U.S. military meets the liberal arts]
But faculty interviewed at some of the 53 no-requirement schools said the situation is not as dire as it looks. Most history students take courses on the United States regardless of the fine print, they said.
“From a purely pragmatic point of view, our curriculum committee has not felt the need for such a requirement because virtually all [history] students take at least one U.S. history course without our needing to require it,” said Daniel Lord Smail, chair of the history department at Harvard.
Among Harvard's requirements for the major is a half-course in U.S. or European history, as well as half-courses in non-western history, pre-modern history and various other seminars and electives. Smail said faculty reviewed the issue “some years ago,” looking at transcripts of history majors, and found no need to make U.S. history a requirement. “I don't remember finding a single transcript that did not include a U.S. history course,” he said.
Georgetown's history chair, Bryan McCann, made a similar point. “We haven't seen the need for a firm requirement,” he said. “Almost all history majors are taking courses that significantly cover the U.S. in any case.”
McCann said most students come to Georgetown with a strong grounding in U.S. history from high school, through Advanced Placement or similar courses. In addition, he said, Georgetown wants to ensure that history students have a firm grasp of global history. “We see that as a strength,” he said.
At U-Md., history chair Philip Soergel said U.S. history is “enduringly popular” among history majors. “But if someone's interests are in a completely different part of the world, that's also defensible that they would study that,” he said.
Duke University's history chair, John Jeffries Martin, said he believes universities must keep the global picture in mind. Duke does not require its history majors to take U.S. history, but Martin said his hunch is that most do a significant amount of their coursework in U.S.-related subjects regardless.
“If there is a problem — and I am not sure that there is one — it is perhaps the opposite of what the [report's] authors imply: that is, that there is too little knowledge in U.S. society about other cultures,” Martin said. He said Duke faculty is “understaffed” in African, Asian, Latin American and Middle Eastern history.
The council, founded in 1995, describes itself as a nonprofit organization “committed to academic freedom, excellence and accountability at America's colleges and universities.” Last year it issued a report critical of colleges and universities that do not require English majors to take a course in Shakespeare.
[Skipping Shakespeare? Yes, English majors can often bypass the Bard]

Here is the full report:
On Thursday afternoon, before a gathering of 50 young people between the ages of 20 and 30 — those who, in the official description, "are exceptional in their potential, their achievements and their drive to make a contribution to their communities" — the prime minister of Canada was publicly complimented on his "sock swag."
In this case, the hosiery was purple with lime green skulls and crossbones.
"You can see, we're just so excited to have this chat with you," offered the moderator, after Justin Trudeau had been greeted by a standing ovation and one whoop. "In particular, we're just amazed by how much you've accomplished in a very short amount of time. It seems like you've awakened, or reawakened rather, the spirit of an inclusive, welcoming, positive Canada."
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, known to wear stylish socks, sports a pair with a skull and crossbones motif in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, Jan. 21, 2016. T (Andrew Vaughan/Canadian Press)
His formidable audience — gathered together as "Global Shapers" and boasting the sort of resumes that humble their elders — was indeed enthusiastic.
"There are three words that you said — '[because] it's 2015' — that really made a lot of people in Nepal, a lot of people around the world, realize the importance of gender parity," a young man recalled of Trudeau's quip after swearing in a cabinet split evenly by gender.
A woman from South Africa said it was "exemplary" how Trudeau had welcomed Syrian refugees to Canada himself, and suggested other leaders might do likewise.
Trudeau wore a tie, but no jacket, the sleeves on his white shirt rolled up to the elbows. Somewhat awkwardly, he delivered his opening statement from a prepared text, but then settled in. A joke about Lord of the Rings was well-received.
At the conclusion of the 50-minute session, Trudeau and the shapers gathered for a group selfie, taken in this case with the assistance of a selfie stick.
Granted, the easily dismissed notion of the selfie was elevated somewhat by the unrelated discovery that Pinchas Goldschmidt, the 52-year-old chief rabbi of Moscow, had earlier posed for such a photo with Trudeau. "Why not?" the rabbi told a Radio-Canada reporter, when asked why he'd stepped forward to share a camera frame with Trudeau. "A, he's good looking. B, he's young. Three, he's the prime minister of Canada."
Pinchas Goldschmidt speaks with Radio-Canada's Joyce Napier at the World Economic Forum in Davos 0:43
So it is not merely the young who are enthusiastic. But it is also not impossible to see what the young might see in him.
He enthused again about diversity. Living with diversity, he said, was one of the major challenges of the 21st century. He spoke of compromise, inclusiveness, shared values, education and bringing the public into the political process.
He spoke of how schools are where Canadian children, celebrating and encountering each other's cultural traditions, learn the notion of diversity. "The range of experiences becomes the mainstream in Canada," he said. "And that for me happens within our public schools, it happens within our education."
A woman in the audience nodded as he spoke.
Diversity and inclusion
He presented his government's welcoming of thousands of Syrian refugees, together with the assistance of communities and civil society, as having a message for Canadians. "I wanted to remind Canadians of who we are," he said. "We, as a country, have succeeded by welcoming people from different parts of the world in difficult times … And we needed to remind ourselves as a country what it is we are capable of."
He also ventured that, "Frankly, if we can highlight how Islam is not incompatible with free and open Western secular democracies, well that's a nice punch in the face of ISIL and everything that they stand for."
Asked how he might use the moral authority of his office to influence the world's understanding of inclusion, he begged off slightly, explaining that it was not for Canada to "impose" a solution. "Canada's never been able to impose by its economic might or its cultural weight," he said. "We've always tried to set forward interesting solutions and succeed for ourselves and share our stories. And that's an approach I think the world needs more of."
Trudeau lamented in jest at one point that there wasn't a Canadian amongst the shapers. And it is surely possible that those in attendance are only observing Trudeau from afar, from the headlines he has generated internationally and the sense of who he is that is projected in how he speaks and what he talks about.
Young crowd gives PM easy ride
Of course, when anything is observed closely and regularly, the flaws are easier to identify. And this was perhaps not the crowd, or the setting, for a tough interrogation. This was about what he so far embodies (and perhaps the delight of having a prime minister in your presence). Much like the suggestion of a day before, by the World Economic Forum's founder, that Trudeau represented the future.
"I think the prime minister is really the new face of youth, driving change in Canada, but his impact cuts across every nation," said Michael Nganga, a delegate from Kenya. "So I'm from Nairobi, and yet I do know about him. Social media, that he's now the prime minister. He's young, looks good, you know, it's in the media, it's everywhere. But you see, him going in, it's such a good representation of that we can actually do it, as youth, as young people, as global shapers."
Nganga livestreamed Trudeau's session and he noted that the comments, he thinks maybe from Canada, were not all positive in regards to the prime minister, with some questioning Trudeau's abilities.
Nganga conceded Trudeau was not perfect.

Low Violence
Originally, the German version of the game found on Steam had "low violence" enabled, which turned blood into "Oil", and has animations for people laying down and putting their hands over their head once killed. It was removed recently due to Germany finally having a decent law in place relating to portraying blood in videogames, and as a result, goes unused. This feature however, can be re enabled by typing -lv in the launch options. For obvious reasons, the console-retail version (Xbox 360 and PS3) is still bloodless.

Before the release of the R8 revolver, Valve was prototyping with its designs. One of them can be seen in an early test design found in a HUD icon.

Message: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wr.al/12OeF
— Four men have been charged with ambushing a Wake County deputy at a child's birthday party over the weekend and beating and kicking him.
Gabriel Moreno, 39, of 3717 Knightdale Estates Drive in Knightdale, Miguel Angel Moreno, 25, of 7216 Old Bunch Road in Wendell, Remi Nambo, 27, of 908 Hadley Road in Raleigh, and Delfino Alejo, 27, of 533 Johnson St. in Garner, were each charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury and malicious assault in secret.
Gabriel Moreno and Nambo were being held in the Wake County jail under $2 million bonds, while the other two were being held under $1 million bonds. Wake County Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Pomeroy said Gabriel Moreno tried to run from and then fought with deputies trying to arrest him, and Nambo had to be subdued by four officers, so their bonds were increased.
All four were ordered to be kept apart in jail and are prohibited from having any outside contact, meaning no visitors, mail or phone calls.
"They're a bunch of cowards, and they should be in jail for a long time," Sheriff Donnie Harrison said Wednesday.
The deputy, who isn't being identified to protect his work in undercover operations and for his family's safety, was at the Panther Branch Community Center, at 10900 Ten-Ten Road in Garner, for a birthday party on Saturday when, according to investigators, Gabriel Moreno asked to speak to him outside. The other three men were hiding behind parked cars outside, and when the deputy came out, they attacked him, Harrison said.
"They hit him, knocked him down to the ground, just started beating him," the sheriff said.
The deputy suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a back injury. He was treated at WakeMed and is now recuperating at home.
Pomeroy said the four men are in a gang.
"This was literally a targeted attack on a law enforcement officer," she said during the first court appearance for the men.
Authorities aren't sure why the deputy was targeted.
"They were saying, 'You're a cop. You're a pig,'" Harrison said. "He doesn't know how they knew he was a police officer or a deputy sheriff."
Investigators are trying to determine if the deputy had arrested any of the men or an acquaintance of theirs in the past, he said.
Three of the four men have criminal records – Miguel Moreno is on probation for an assault last March, Gabriel Moreno served time a decade ago for an assault and Alejo finished a sentence for robbery a year ago – and Nambo and the Moreno brothers both have pending assault and resisting arrest charges in a separate incident.
Harrison said it the motive for the attack might simply be a dislike of law enforcement.
"We found out you're a cop, and we don't like you. We're going to do something about it – and they did," he said. "It's bad when a person can't even go to a party, when a person can't even go out to eat with the family, without being – somebody's looking over my shoulder."
Alex Moreno, the sister of Gabriel and Miguel Moreno, said that wasn't the case.
"Alcohol had a lot to do with it. They were drinking a lot," Alex Moreno said, noting that she was at the party.
"Either party said something that might have disagreed with the other, I don't know," she said. "He was definitely not targeted, not because he was a cop. I don't think because he was a cop."
More arrests are possible in the case, Harrison said.

Last week's was a record-breaking edition of Video Friday, with a total of 12 videos. But don't worry. We're outdoing ourselves this week: Sit back and enjoy 12 new awesome robot videos and one audio.
Snake robots are cool. They slither. They swim. They shoot laser with their mouths. Researchers often say that snakebots are great for search and rescue applications. You send one into a disaster site and use its cameras to see what's going on there. But with all the slithering and rolling and undulating, watching through a snakebot's eyes might be a nausea-inducing experience. Now the folks at the CMU Biorobotics Lab might have a solution. The clip below shows how their snake robot can point its head in a desired direction while climbing on a pole: the whole body moves; the head doesn't. Pretty cool. And check out their other vid as well, showing the snake tracking a moving object while climbing.

Bartenders beware: the robots are coming for your job. The creators of Bartendro, an open-source cocktail dispensing robot, have put their project on Kickstarter. They've designed and fabricated their own liquid-dispensing devices, which include a custom control board and a "peristaltic pump." A Raspberry Pi computer commands up to 15 of these precision dispensers to concoct a variety of cocktails. The design still need some improvements (it can't handle carbonated beverages), but we can see this thing becoming a hit at parties and events. And some people have already suggested add-ons, such as a card reader for payment or a breathalyzer.

Thanks, Garran!
What's that below? PR2 learning to use chopsticks? Not quite. The video is a demo, created by researcher Johnathan Brookshire from MIT, of "teleoperation with constraints." As the name implies, the idea is you impose constraints in how the robot can move its body, especially its arms and hands, and this can help tremendously in accomplishing a variety of tasks that involve motion in a specific direction or plane. It might even help to master chopsticks after all.
A twelve-year-old geek finds a humanoid robot in a dumpster. They become best buddies. It turns out the robot was created by a scientist who, unhappy with the idea of his company using the robot for military applications, had programmed the humanoid to flee. Now the company wants the robot back. This is the plot of Robosapien: Rebooted, a movie so stuffed with cheap CGI and cringe-worthy cliches that it might as well become a cult. To debut sometime this year.

ROS, the Robot Operating System, is steadily making its way into industrial robotics. In the demo below, a Universal Robots UR5 arm and a Motoman SIA20 manipulator collaborate to sort parts. Using 3D sensors, the robots locate, identify, and retrieve the parts, using on-the-fly path planning to perform the task. The cool thing is that two different robots are controlled by a single ROS-Industrial program. The demo was shown at Automate 2013 in Chicago.

TUNICA, MS - Rising middleweight contender Sergiy Derevyanchenko (9-0, 7 KOs) will battle unbeaten Kemahl Russell (10-0, 8 KOs) in the 10-round main event of Premier Boxing Champions TOE-TO-TOE TUESDAYS on FS1 & BOXEO DE CAMPEONES on FOX Deportes Tuesday, March 14 from the Fitz Tunica Casino & Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi.
Televised coverage begins at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT and will see exciting light heavyweight prospect Ahmed Elbiali (14-0, 11 KOs) in an eight-round bout plus unbeaten welterweight prospect Jamontay Clark (10-0, 6 KOs) in an eight-round contest.
"I am thrilled to be returning to the ring and I'm determined to put on a great performance for all the fans watching," said Derevyanchenko. "I know that I'm facing a tough, undefeated fighter with power, but I'm very close to a world title opportunity and no one will stop me from achieving my dream."
"I believe that I have the tools to win this fight and I'm coming to show the world that me and my Jamaican countrymen belong on this big stage," said Russell. "I'm ready to step up to this challenge and make my country proud. This has been one of the best training camps I've had and I'm looking forward to this opportunity. I only want to fight the best and I'm ready to prove it on March 14."
Tickets for the live event, which is promoted by TGB Promotions, start at $20, and are on sale now. Tickets can be purchased at the Fitz Gift Shop, at www.ticketmaster.com or by calling Ticketmaster at 800-745-3000.
A highly decorated amateur who represented his native Ukraine in the 2008 Olympics, Derevyanchenko now lives and trains in Brooklyn. His 2016 saw him earn a TKO victory over Mike Guy in March before stopping former champion Sam Soliman in the second round of a world title eliminator in July. The unbeaten fighter defeated a slew of experienced contenders in 2015 with wins over Elvin Ayala, Alan Campa, Vladine Biosse and a thrilling third-round stoppage of Jessie Nicklow.
Representing Jamaica, Russell enters this bout unbeaten since turning pro in 2013. The 27-year-old made his name in his home country by winning the Jamaican version of The Contender in 2015 with a stoppage of Richard Holmes. Russell picked up two more victories in 2016, including a second round knockout of Henry Mercer in his U.S. debut in October.
A native of Cairo, Egypt now residing in Miami, the 26-year-old Elbiali had success in three TOE-TO-TOE TUESDAY appearances over the last two years. Those three contests saw him score a first round knockout of Fabiano Pena and eight-round unanimous decisions over Mariano Hilario and Andrew Hernandez.
An unbeaten prospect fight at home in Cincinnati, the "Quiet Assassin" Clark picked up two victories in 2016 over increasingly quality competition as he stopped Elvin Perez in six rounds and earned a unanimous decision over Edgar Ortega. The 22-year-old last fought in his hometown in 2015 when he recorded a second round TKO of Joe Wilson Jr.
Python's enumerate() Function Demystified How and why you should use the built-in enumerate function in Python to write cleaner and more Pythonic loops.
Python's enumerate function is a mythical beast—it's hard to summarize its purpose and usefulness in a single sentence. And yet, it's a super useful feature that many beginners and even intermediate Pythonistas are blissfully unaware of. Basically, enumerate() allows you to loop over a collection of items while keeping track of the current item's index in a counter variable. Let's take a look at an example: names = [ 'Bob' , 'Alice' , 'Guido' ] for index , value in enumerate ( names ): print ( f '{index}: {value}' ) This leads to the following output: 0 : Bob 1 : Alice 2 : Guido As you can see, this iterated over the names list and generated an index for each element by increasing a counter variable starting at zero. [ If you're wondering about the f'...' string syntax I used in the above example, this is a new string formatting technique available in Python 3.6 and above. ]
Make Your Loops More Pythonic With enumerate() Now why is keeping a running index with the enumerate function useful? I noticed that new Python developers coming from a C or Java background sometimes use the following range(len(...)) antipattern to keep a running index while iterating over a list with a for -loop: # HARMFUL: Don't do this for i in range ( len ( my_items )): print ( i , my_items [ i ]) By using the enumerate function skillfully, like I showed you in the “names” example above, you can make this looping construct much more “Pythonic” and idiomatic. There's usually no need to generate element indexes manually in Python—you simply leave all of this work to the enumerate function. And as a result your code will be easier to read and less vulnerable to typos.
Changing the Starting Index Another useful feature is the ability to choose the starting index for the enumeration. To enumerate() function accepts an optional argument which allows you to set the initial value for its counter variable: names = [ 'Bob' , 'Alice' , 'Guido' ] for index , value in enumerate ( names , 1 ): print ( f '{index}: {value}' ) In the above example I changed the function call to enumerate(names, 1) and the extra 1 argument now starts the index at one instead of zero: 1 : Bob 2 : Alice 3 : Guido Voilà, this is how you switch from zero-based indexing to starting with index 1 (or any other int , for that matter) using Python's enumerate() function.
How enumerate() Works Behind The Scenes You might be wondering how the enumerate function works behind the scenes. Part of it's magic lies in the fact that enumerate is implemented as a Python iterator. This means that element indexes are generated lazily (one by one, just-in-time), which keeps memory use low and keeps this construct so fast. Let's play with some more code to demonstrate what I mean: >>> names = [ 'Bob' , 'Alice' , 'Guido' ] >>> enumerate ( names ) < enumerate object at 0x1057f4120 > In the above code snippet I set up the same enumeration you've already seen in the previous examples. But instead of immediately looping over the result of the enumerate call I'm just displaying the returned object on the Python console. As you can see, it's an “enumerate object.” This is the actual iterator. And like I said, it generates its output elements lazily and one by one when they're requested. In order to retrieve those “on demand” elements so we can inspect them, I'm going to call the built-in list() function on the iterator: >>> list ( enumerate ( names )) [( 0 , 'Bob' ), ( 1 , 'Alice' ), ( 2 , 'Guido' )] For each element in the input list ( names ) the iterator returned by enumerate() produces a tuple of the form (index, element) . In your typical for-in loop you'll use this to your advantage by leveraging Python's data structure unpacking feature: for index , element in enumerate ( iterable ): # ...
MANILA, Philippines - Widely renowned for his action films such as â€œCon Air,â€ â€œThe Rock,â€ â€œNational Treasure,â€ â€œFaceoffâ€ and â€œGone in 60 Seconds,â€ Nicolas Cage is back in the thick of non-stop action in DreamWorks Animationâ€™s 3D action family adventure â€œThe Croods.â€
In â€œThe Croods,â€ Cage plays Grug whom he lends his voice to â€“ an overprotective caveman patriarch to his family in the midst of an ever-changing environ where predators lurk behind every rock. Earthâ€™s movements force them to leave their cave and move towards the light and unchartered territories. In the thick of adventure, Grug is ever mindful of his family including his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), Eep (Emma Stone), Thunk (Clark Duke), Gran (Cloris Leachman) and baby.
Along the way, the Croods meet Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) whose dazzling new discoveries â€“ like fire...and shoes â€“ shake up the Croods in unexpected ways. Most of the family (especially Eep) is open to Guyâ€™s vision of a new place called â€œtomorrow,â€ but Grug sees the biggest calamity yet: a charming teenage boy from which he must â€œprotectâ€ Eep.
Change, like everything else, doesnâ€™t come easily to Grug, whose stubbornness is matched only by his love for his clan and by his heroic work ethic. For Grug, there are no weekends, holidays or sick days; heâ€™s on watch, 24/7, 365 days a year. He lives by many credos, including the aforementioned â€œfear is good; change is bad,â€ as well as other Grug-isms, such as: â€œAnything fun is badâ€ and â€œNever not be afraid.â€
Grugâ€™s ethos is â€˜fear is good; change is badâ€™ and he tries to shield his loved ones from the threat posed by a uncertain world by keeping them hidden in a cave, venturing out only when they need to hunt for food. For Eep, sheltering inside a mountain is just boring and she yearns for something more.
â€œGrug and Eepâ€™s relationship is one that many families can relate to â€“ the overprotective father and the teenage daughter who wants to have some adventure and explore. And the transformation and the growth they go through together makes for a very funny and a very heart-warming experience,â€ says Cage.
Academy AwardÂ® winner Nicolas Cage says he empathizes with his on-screen alter ego, because â€œitâ€™s impossible to be a father and avoid thinking about your childâ€™s first crush, or about keeping up with your kidsâ€™ new ways of thinking. Iâ€™m a father myself and I think if you care itâ€™s impossible not to be a protective father because you want your loved ones to be safe. The problem is with Grug, even though there is a lot of humour in his attitude, he has stopped living and heâ€™s just surviving. And thatâ€™s the great lesson that he gets from Eep, which is that you have to follow the light.â€
â€œWe, as parents, go too far sometimes, but thatâ€™s where Grug is at,â€ Cage continues. â€œHe does experience a transformation, which we all must do at some point in our lives.â€
Upon seeing the film in its final cut, Cage admitted he was overwhelmed, â€œLook, Iâ€™m a pretty emotional guy and Iâ€™m in touch with my feelings. I wouldnâ€™t be able to do the work that Iâ€™ve selected for myself if I wasnâ€™t,â€ he says. â€œI had to look at the ceiling to stop from welling up. I really had to pull my stuff together. And thatâ€™s all down to the power of the story telling. These guys, (directors) Kirk and Chris, are very creative and very talented storytellers.â€
â€œI saw it with the most people Iâ€™ll ever see it with, it was a huge audience, and I was blown away. I was lost in the visual spectacle of the movie because itâ€™s so beautiful. â€œI was very taken with the imagination and the talent that went into this film. There are some extraordinarily creative people designing the animals in the movie and the landscapes in the movie. I think I could see The Croods ten times in a row and always find something new in it,â€ continues Cage.
Cage concludes, â€œAnd I think that the relationships in the movie are so real. Itâ€™s about a family and the relationships within a family and that, I think, will resonate with people everywhereâ€
â€œThe Croodsâ€(3D) opens March 22 in cinemas nationwide from DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox to be distributed by Warner Bros.
