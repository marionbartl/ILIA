Roland Tormey (born 1971 in Dublin) is an Irish sociologist, teacher, researcher and curriculum developer.  They are the head of Teaching Support Centre at EPFL's (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) College of Humanities.
Career
Tormey studied sociology and social administration at the University College Dublin and earned their bachelor's degree in 1992. They then perused a PhD in sociology and joined James Wickham at the Trinity College Dublin. They graduated in 2000 with a thesis on "The Part-Time Soul: Case Studies in the Management of Culture and Flexibility in Irish Retail." At the London South Bank University they earned a postgraduate certificate in development and environmental education in 2000. From 1996 to 2004 they were a lecturer in sociology at Mary Immaculate College at the University of Limerick, before moving to the Department of Education and Professional Studies at University of Limerick, where they become Department Head in 2009.
Since 2011, they have worked at EPFL, where they teach and researches in learning sciences and engineering education and is head of the Teaching Support Centre.
Research
While at University of Limerick and at the Mary Immaculate College Tormey's research focus lay on the representation of ethnicity and national identity in school curricula, which contributed to the development of the Irish National Intercultural Education Guidelines for Irish Primary and Post-primary schools; the pedagogy of social sciences, where they studied the development of social scientific thinking in upper secondary school students and was instrumental for the in the development of Irish national syllabus for Sociology and Political Science; and emotional intelligence and emotional competences in initial teacher education. This work highlighted the emotional demands on student teachers as well as calling into question numerous pre-existing assumptions about teacher emotional intelligence and about the relationship between measured emotional intelligence and teacher performance .
Their current research is focused on evidence-informed approaches to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher learning at universities; the development of meta-cognition in students transitioning into STEM; and the impact of gender on group work experiences of engineering students. An emerging research area Tormey peruses is the study of emotions in engineering ethics education.
Their research was featured in the Swiss television RTS and at the French CRI.
Distinctions
Tormey is a member of the board of directors of the European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI; elected in 2020), member of the board of directors of Global Schoolroom (since 2013), and co-chair of the SEFI Engineering Ethics Special Interest Group (since 2019). They were previously a member of the board of the Swiss Faculty Development Network (SFDN; 2016-2020). They have represented Ireland on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) steering committee and task force on the decade of education for sustainable development and was co-chair of the UNECE Expert Group on Competences in ESD from 2009 to 2011.

The Communications Research Centre Canada (CRC; ) is a Canadian government scientific laboratory for research and development in wireless technologies, with a particular focus on the efficient use of radio frequency spectrum. Its mission is as follows:
To perform wireless telecommunications research and development (R&D) that advances the efficient use of the radio spectrum, and serves as the government's leading source of scientific knowledge and technical advice for spectrum management, regulation and policy purposes;
To support critical wireless telecommunications operational requirements of Government of Canada departments and agencies, such as National Defence and Public Safety;
To take part in strategic R&D collaborations that leverage CRC's activities, resulting in knowledge and technology transfer that benefit Canadian industry, the economy and Canadians.
History
Officially established in 1969, CRC's roots can be traced back to the late 1940s and the Canadian Defence Research Board (DRB). The Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE) existed from 1951-1969 within the DRB. In 1969, the federal government established a Department of Communications. The DRTE in its entirety was transferred to the new department's research branch, and renamed the Communications Research Centre. The CRC came under Industry Canada's wing in 1994. Throughout its history, the CRC has made significant contributions to the information and communications technology sector in Canada and abroad.
Achievements
The CRC contributed to many "firsts" in Canadian communications, a number of which involved satellite communications. In 1962 the then-DRTE launched Alouette 1, Canada's first satellite. This led to the development of Canada's own communications satellite program. In 1976 the HERMES satellite was launched. It was the first high-powered satellite and the first to operate at the higher frequency Ku-band. In 1978, CRC offered the world's first direct-to-home satellite television broadcast via Hermes - a Stanley Cup hockey game. Later that year, the CRC gave a public demonstration of Telidon, the Canadian videotex/teletext system that contributed to the development of international standards for the Web. In 1983, CRC set up the first permanent Canadian governmental connection to the Internet, via an ARPANET connection (the first full international connection to the USENET portion of the then-Internet being the set up in 1981 by Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto). In the 1980s, the CRC funded and led the development of SHARP, which in 1987 became the world's first microwave-powered aircraft to fly. The CRC is responsible for many other firsts that have impacted Canadian telecommunications: in wireless systems; radio fundamentals, e.g., Software Defined Radio; communication networks; photonics and interactive multimedia.
Recognition of the CRC's contributions include the 1993 designation of the Alouette-ISIS Program as one of the 10 most outstanding achievements in the first 100 years of engineering in Canada. In 2007, the Alouette 1 Satellite Program was designated a National Historic Event. In 1995, the Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute awarded CRC's SARSAT team, headed by Dr. A. Winter, Mr. H. Werstiuk and Dr. B. Blevis, the first ever Alouette Award for contributions in advancing search and rescue technology. The CRC has won three Emmy Awards: one in 1987 for its role in developing the Ku-band technology of the HERMES satellite; another awarded in 2009 for its contribution to standardizing the ATSC Digital Television System; and a third presented in 2012 for its role in standardizing loudness metering for use in broadcast audio. CRC's research and development in telecommunications also earned it the 2007 Special Recognition Award from Canada's Telecommunication Hall of Fame.

Arts & culture
Menifee County is home to the Menifee Community Theatre Group, a small-town local and regional arts organization that has produced 17 theatrical productions to date. The group has over 40 members and hosts an annual locally-written theatrical and film presentation, taking place at the Menifee Mountain Memories Festival and centering on local and Appalachian stories collected from local citizens.
Demographics
As of the census of 2000, there were 6,556 people, 2,537 households, and 1,900 families residing in the county. The population density was . There were 3,710 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the county was 97.64% White, 1.37% Black or African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.03% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.14% from other races, and 0.69% from two or more races. 1.11% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.
There were 2,537 households, out of which 32.00% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.40% were married couples living together, 8.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.10% were non-families. 22.10% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.10% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 2.88.
In the county, the population was spread out, with 24.90% under the age of 18, 10.10% from 18 to 24, 28.10% from 25 to 44, 25.20% from 45 to 64, and 11.80% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 101.80 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.10 males.
The median income for a household in the county was $22,064, and the median income for a family was $26,325. Males had a median income of $25,670 versus $17,014 for females. The per capita income for the county was $11,399. About 23.40% of families and 29.60% of the population were below the poverty line, including 38.50% of those under age 18 and 23.40% of those age 65 or over.
Politics
The county has historically been Democratic-dominated, voting for the Democratic nominee in every election from its first election in 1872 through 1996 apart from one lone show of support for Herbert Hoover in 1928. In the 21st century, however, it has, like most of Kentucky outside the Louisville, Lexington, and Frankfort areas, trended powerfully Republican. It cast its second-ever Republican vote for George W. Bush in 2000, even as Bush narrowly lost the national popular vote, and although it returned to the Democratic fold in 2004 and 2008, it was at greatly reduced levels compared to what Democrats could typically count on in the 20th century; neither John Kerry nor Barack Obama in 2008 managed even to reach the vote share in the county that George McGovern received in 1972. The county went red again in 2012, voting for its first-ever losing Republican nominee, and has continued voting Republican by increasing margins. In 2020, it gave Donald Trump nearly three-quarters of its vote, approaching the 76.8% it gave Carter in 1976 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Joe Biden, meanwhile, sank below a quarter of the county's vote, a level even Hillary Clinton had managed to stay above.

The Calcutta Chromosome is a 1995 English-language novel by Indian author Amitav Ghosh. The book, set in Calcutta and New York City at some unspecified time in the future, is a medical thriller that dramatizes the adventures of people who are brought together by a mysterious turn of events. The book is loosely based on the life and times of Sir Ronald Ross, the Nobel Prize–winning scientist who achieved a breakthrough in malaria research in 1898. The novel was the recipient of the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1997.
Ghosh employs a factual background for the invented events in the novel, drawing upon Ross' Memoirs which were published in 1923.
Plot summary
The novel begins with the story of Antar, a resident of the future New York doing data processing for the International Water Council. A chance bit of data causes Antar to recall a bizarre encounter they had with L. Murugan, an employee of the LifeWatch organization (Antar's former employer), who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995. Murugan had asked to be transferred to Calcutta because of their fascination with the life of Sir Ronald Ross. While Antar tries to track Murugan's movements in Calcutta through the digitized archives, another narrative thread follows Murugan directly as their path brings them into contact with a variety of other characters, some more savory than others. The plot is quite complex and its timelines are deliberately mixed up, switching from Antar's time to Murugan's to Ross' and back over the course of as many chapters.
Through their research into old and lost documents and phone messages, Antar determines that Murugan had systematically unearthed a deep secret lurking behind Ross' malaria research — an underground scientific and mystical movement that could grant eternal life. Loosely described, the process of securing this form of immortality is as follows: the disciples of this movement can transfer their chromosomes into another's body, and gradually become that person or take over that person. In the novel, Ronald Ross did not discover the mysteries of the malaria parasite; it was a group of underground practitioners of a different, mystical "science," natives of India, who helped to guide Ross to the conclusions for which they are famous. These native Indians provided Ross with clues in the belief that in the moment Ross made their discovery, the parasite would change its nature. At this point, a new variant of malaria would emerge and the group's research using the chromosome-transfer technique would advance even further.
Themes
Silence is a recurring theme in the novel, originating from the often-stated premise that to say something is to change it. Huttunen notes that the workings of the Indian scientific/mystical movement uncovered by Murugan "constitutes a counter-science to Western scientific discourse" (25). The tenets of the group contain aspects of the Hindu belief in the transmigration of souls as well as of contemporary scientific ideas about genetics and cloning (Huttunen 27). Its native Indian members operate through means kept secret from the more Westernized characters and from the reader, and their activities become progressively clearer as the novel continues until their plan is revealed to the reader. Huttunen explains that the methodology of this group is based on the ideas of Emmanuel Levinas about communication by way of silence. In Levinas' view, "the other exists outside the traditional ontology of Western philosophy which conceives of all being as objects that can be internalized by consciousness or grasped by adequate representation ... Consequently silence in this novel represents the kind of unattainable experience that transcends the level of language, or knowing" (30-31). It is this enigma that the novel leaves behind as an abiding theme. The reader is forced to keep thinking about it much after turning the last page. The mystery at the heart of the story is never completely resolved by the author, leaving much to the reader's understanding and interpretation.
Characters
Antar - A man in the future who is about to retire.  They are investigating the disappearance of Murugan.
Murugan - They call themselves Morgan from time to time. They live in the 1990s and is an authority on Sir Ronald Ross. Much of the novel is about theirs tracking the life of Ronald Ross.
Ronald Ross - The Nobel Prize–winning scientist who found out that malaria is spread through mosquitoes. Much of their research is spoken about. They conducted their experiments on a man called 'Lutchman.' Their tale is narrated by Murugan.
Lutchman - They once lived at Renupur station. Their family and whole village had been wiped out by a strange epidemic. They were later picked up by Ross for their experiments and did everything for him. They claimed they were a 'dhooley bearer' or a cleaner. Later in the novel it is revealed that their name was actually 'Laakhan' and they changed their name at every village to sound like a local.
Mangala - Cleaning woman at Doctor Cunningham's laboratory, but that's their disguise, they are in reality a Demi God who not only discovered the means of treating syphilis with the Malaria parasite but also found a form of asexual reproduction/reincarnation for humans which kept them and Lutchman alive forever.
Sonali - A writer for Calcutta Magazine, a journalist, and actor who, it is suggested in the novel, transforms themselves with the help of Mangala's "science"
Urmila - A journalist for the same publication as Sonali, they are the one Mangala chooses for their transformation or reincarnation.
Romen Haldar - Lutchman in their most recent reincarnation.
Awards
The Calcutta Chromosome won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1997.

The Secretary of State for the Southern Department was a position in the cabinet of the government of the Kingdom of Great Britain up to 1782, when the Southern Department became the Home Office.
History
Before 1782, the responsibilities of the two British Secretaries of State for the Northern and the Southern departments were divided not based on the principles of modern ministerial divisions, but geographically. The Secretary of State for the Southern Department was responsible for Ireland, the Channel Islands, France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, the states of Italy, and the Ottoman Empire. They were also responsible for the American colonies until 1768, when the charge was given to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Secretary of State for the Northern Department was responsible for relations with the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, and the Holy Roman Empire. Domestic responsibilities in England and Wales were shared between the two Secretaries. After the union with Scotland in 1707, the two secretaries also took responsibility for Scotland when there was no Secretary of State for Scotland in office.
Until 1706, the practice was generally for the senior official to lead the Southern Department, and the junior the Northern Department, with the Northern Secretary being transferred to the Southern Department when a vacancy arose at the latter. During the reigns of George I and George II, however, the Northern Department began to be seen as the more important, since its responsibilities included the monarchs' ancestral home of Hanover. During the reign of George III, the two departments were of approximately equal importance.
In 1782, the two Secretaries of State were reformed as the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

The NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), formerly known as Division I-AA, is the second-highest level of college football in the United States, after the Football Bowl Subdivision. Sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the FCS level comprises 130 teams in 15 conferences as of the 2022 season. The FCS designation is only tied to football with the non-football sports programs of each school generally competing in NCAA Division I.
History
From 1906 to 1955, the NCAA had no divisional structure for member schools. Prior to the 1956 college football season, schools were organized into an upper NCAA University Division and lower NCAA College Division. From 1973 to 1977, all schools participated in a single NCAA Division I group. Prior to the 1978 season, schools were again organized into upper NCAA Division I-A and lower NCAA Division I-AA groupings. These two divisions were renamed as NCAA Division I FBS and NCAA Division I FCS prior to the 2006 season.
Championships
The FCS has held a post-season playoff to award an NCAA-sanctioned national championship since its inception in 1978. The size of the playoff bracket has increased from 4 teams in 1978 to 24 teams in the 2020 season. This makes the FCS the highest level of college football with an NCAA-sanctioned national championship.

Virtual Database Manager (VDB) is software designed to represent some non-relational data in a virtual data warehouse without copying the original data and allow real time access to the data.
VDB is a framework written in Java allowing access to data via the standard SQL language through a conventional JDBC driver. The data are represented into its virtual data warehouse to facilitate the usage of analysis and reporting tools.
History
Needs
Because of the need for independence and neutral access to information in a governance process, SAP Business Objects' administrators and managers need to analyse the content of the platform, such as security control, license compliance or document relationships, by using standard reporting tools which are used standard SQL.
As said Jacob Nikom of MIT's Lincoln Laboratory in 2009, "real-time data warehousing", .. was so accurate,, to have the best analysis of original data, VDM must provide real time access to the most recent data.
Issues
SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise repository's structure does not use a normalized design, although it is physically stored in a relational database. For performance reason, all data which represents an object (Folders, Documents, Users, Groups) is stored in a flat table. Each row includes ids and keys and a blob for the metadata and the security access control lists. This metadata are not accessible through standard SQL. None of the standard reporting tools can access this metadata, including SAP BusinessObjects' native documents (Web Intelligence).
Solution
To solve all these issues, SoftNtic has decided to design the product – Enterprise Connector – which permit a live and real time SQL access to the repository and its founder, Thomas Trolez, got the idea of Virtual Database Manager for the core engine which provide a real time representation of the needed data in a virtual data warehouse which permit the usage of standard analysis and reporting tools.
VDM was developed by SoftNtic SAS between 2009 and 2010 and integrated as the core engine of its "Enterprise Connector" product to access SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise repository.
How it works
To allow a representation of the data in a virtual data warehouse without copying them, VDM designed a virtual star schema consisting of virtual fact and dimension tables. The original data are represented and organized into virtual tables (standard table and fact table). These tables are virtually linked in an n,m relation and the JDBC driver exposes the virtual database model as though the original data were held in these "tables".
When an SQL request is received by the JDBC driver, it is analyzed with SoftNtic's Lexer/parser, determining:
The best path (depending on its cost) to retrieve all the requested data
The virtual tables associated with the mandatory data (requested and technical). For example, the unique identifier of an object.
The pre-treatment and post-treatment filters
Depending on these elements, the system calls an encoder/decoder to retrieve the data from the native system. Each encoder/decoder depends on the implementation. In the case of Enterprise Connector, the encoders/decoders use the SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise SDK to access to the repository.

Kenneth Charles Hollyman (18 November 1922 – 14 May 2009) was a Welsh professional footballer.
Career
Hollyman began their career playing for Cardiff Nomads before joining Cardiff City in 1939. They played in more than eighty wartime matches, serving with the Fleet Air Arm during the war, for the club before eventually making their league debut against Norwich City on the opening day of the 1946–47 season, the first season of league football following the end of World War II. They missed very few games in the next few years, including being ever-present during the 1950–51 season, before being allowed to leave in 1953 to join Newport County.
In the 1958–59 FA Cup Newport County faced Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round. The game was played in heavy snow away at White Hart Lane, and although County lost 4–1 their goal came from a 35-yard effort by Hollyman. This made the scoreline 1–2, giving County the hope that they could force an upset upon Bill Nicholson's men (who were double winners a year later). However, two late goals for Tottenham ended County's hopes of pulling off a shock result.
Hollyman spent seven years with Newport County at Somerton Park before leaving to become player-coach at Ton Pentre.
Hollyman died in Cardiff on 14 May 2009 at the age of 86.

The Edna is a historic building in the King-Lincoln Bronzeville neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio. It was built in 1905 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. The three-story brick building has . It was associated with the migration of African Americans to northern cities, including then-segregated Columbus. Businesses at the time had to cater to Blacks or whites; this building housed the Fireside Mutual Aid Association, an insurance company for Black residents. The building later housed the African American newspaper the Ohio Sentinel, as well as the Dukes and Duchesses, a private upscale social club for African Americans. The building is now owned by the City of Columbus, which requested proposals for the property from developers in 2009.
In 2022, it was announced that the county land bank, the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation, will purchase, restore, and move into the building, and use some space in the building to rent to other organizations. The project is estimated to be completed in spring 2023 at a cost of $2.5-3 million.

Theotokis (, Theotókēs), in Italian and older English literature Theotochi or Teotochi, is a Greek aristocratic family from Corfu.
History
The family are an old landowning family in Corfu, Greece, several members of which have been prominent politicians. They originally hailed from Constantinople, whence they fled following its fall to the Ottomans, eventually settling in Corfu. The painter El Greco (Domenico Theotokopoulos) was descended from a branch of the same family that fled to Crete. The Corfiote branch was ennobled by the Republic of Venice and was entered in the Libro d'Oro; they used to be commonly referred to as Counts (Cónte), but their titles lapsed when the Ionian islands became part of the Kingdom of Greece, which did not recognise noble titles.
As the family prospered, nicknames were devised to distinguish between the various male-line Theotokis. The Greek genealogist distinguished the following branches:
The Calocardarei (Καλοκαρδαρέοι) or Spilia (της Σπηλιάς, "of the cave"), from a quarter of the city of Corfu where they resided. Its members bore the title of count.
The Stathachi (Σταθάκοι) or del Santo (του Αγίου, "of the Saint"), due to the proximity of their residence to the church of Corfu's patron, Saint Spyridon. Its members bore the title of baron.
The Sclebuni (Σκλεμπούνοι)
The Zammarco (Ζαμμάρκο, του Σαν Μάρκο), from Saint Mark (San Marco in Italian), the patron of Venice.
The D'Aviazzo (Νταβιάτζο) or Politikoí (Πολιτικοί), who became a distinguished political dynasty in Greece.
The Andrucelli (Ανδρουτσέλλοι). Its members bore the title of count.

The Vanderbilt Lane Historic District is a small area along the street of the same name, just east of US 9 in Hyde Park, New York, United States. It was used for the farm functions of the nearby estate of Walter Langdon and, later, Frederick Vanderbilt. Most of its buildings date to the turn of the 19th century, with one remaining from the 1830s.
Many of its buildings and infrastructure remain intact. It is one of only two estate farm complexes on the east side of the Hudson that has not been razed and redeveloped. In 1993 it was recognized as a historic district and added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Geography
The district is composed of some larger lots on the north corner of the Route 9 junction, and some to the southeast of those, across the street. It is a 10-acre (4 ha) area with ten total contributing properties: five buildings, one structure (a well) and three objects (a gated stone wall and two fire hydrants).
All the lots are developed. The area nevertheless retains a pastoral quality, since the houses and buildings are small-scale frame, stone and brick constructions in the Federal or Shingle architectural styles. There is plenty of room for the large shade trees, lawns and landscaping. Vanderbilt Lane, which begins at Route 9 just opposite one of the lesser gates to the Vanderbilt estate, is also narrow, more like a driveway than a through street.
There are two properties on the north side of the lane: the superintendent's house, a clapboard-sided one-story five-bay building on the west near Route 9, and a barn complex, partially destroyed by a past fire. On the south are a Federal-style frame herdsman's house, a shingle-sided coach house and a creamery.
History
When Vanderbilt bought the estate in 1895, the farm complex across what was then just the Albany Post Road was in disrepair. The herdsman's house, an 1830 one-and-half-story five-bay rectangular frame building with gabled asphalt-shingled roof, was built when Robert Langdon owned the property. It is the oldest building in the district and the only one whose location there precedes Vanderbilt's ownership of the land.
Vanderbilt had the buildings on the north side constructed on the site of older counterparts. The architect is not known but it is likely that they hired McKim, Mead & White, which had designed not only their mansion but a nearby house for their secretary, for the job. They were completed in 1901.
The buildings the firm responded with are distinctive for their mix of exterior texture. The barn complex employs many aspects of the Shingle style, not only the wood shingle siding but the conical towers, rusticated stone ends, and cross-gabled roofs. The superintendent's house likewise uses much exposed wood. The creamery, across the street, is the most distinctive property in the district, a stone building with a hipped roof covered in wood shingles and pierced by a brick chimney.
In 1905, Vanderbilt had the coach house, originally part of the neighboring Sexton estate that stood just south of the superintendent's house, moved to the east in two sections. They used it to house their Belgian thoroughbred horses.
After Vanderbilt's death in 1938, their niece was persuaded to donate the mansion to the federal government for eventual use as a historic site. The Vanderbilt Lane properties were separated and subdivided at that time, all eventually being converted for residential use. They have been minimally altered since then.

Rod (J. Roderick) Coutts is a Canadian entrepreneur and a co-founder of Teklogix International. They were born in Cookstown, Ontario. Coutts graduated from University of Waterloo in 1964 with a Bachelor of Applied Science Degree in Electrical Engineering.
In 2000, Coutts donated an estimated $7 million in shares to the University of Waterloo, as their tribute to the school.
"My family has had a lot of good fortune over the years and the University of Waterloo had a lot to do with that," says Coutts. "This is my chance to give something back."
In return for their generosity, the University has named a building after him: J.R. Coutts Engineering Lecture Hall (commonly referred to as Rod Coutts Hall, or RCH). Since then, Coutts has continued supporting the university by funding bursaries and scholarships.
In 2007, Rod Coutts received their Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.'07).
Teklogix
Coutts was the founder of Teklogix International with four other young entrepreneurs: Lawrie Cragg, Al Vanderburgh, Cliff Bernard and Pete Halsall. The company focused on providing mobile workers with wireless data transmission and real-time data management within the logistics industry. Teklogix became Psion Teklogix in the year 2000, after it was purchased for $544 million (Cdn.) by U.K.-based Psion, started by David Potter.
Coutts met the other Teklogix founders while working at Ferranti International's Canadian division, Ferranti-Packard Electronics. Ferranti-Packard was known for projects related to FP6000 (Ferranti-Packard 6000, which became the ICL 1900), ReserVec, Back Up Interceptor Control (BUIC) for the United States Military, as well as Ferranti-Packard's drum memory systems. They worked closely on drum memory associated with the early warning radar system for North America. Coutts and the rest of the founding group left Ferranti-Packard and formed Teklogix in 1967.

Robert Le Rossignol (27 April 1884 – 26 June 1976) was a British chemist.  They are most known for their work with Fritz Haber on the fixation of nitrogen from atmospheric air, the Haber process.
They were born in Saint Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, and attended school there. They matriculated from the University of London in 1901 and graduated from University College London in 1905 where they remained, becoming a member of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and a Fellow of the Chemical Society of London. In 1908–1909, they worked with Fritz Haber in Germany on the difficult problem of demonstrating ammonia synthesis from air, eventually producing a tabletop apparatus that worked at 200 atmospheres pressure. Haber was awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery that virtually "made bread from the air" and recognized the assistance he'd received from Le Rossignol, whose name appears on Haber's patents for the process.
They were interned in Germany in 1914 at the outbreak of the first World War, but was released to work for the Auergesellschaft during the war. They returned to the UK after the war. They joined the General Electric Company (UK) research laboratory, where they remained for the rest of their career, working on thermionic valves.
They lived in Penn, Buckinghamshire and was a noted philanthropist using the royalty income they received from the Haber patent. Their two sons were both killed during World War II.

Déserts (1950–1954) is a piece by Edgard Varèse for 14 winds (brass and woodwinds), 5 percussion players, 1 piano, and electronic tape. The piece is scored for 2 flutes (both doubling piccolo), 2 clarinets (one doubling E-flat clarinet and one doubling bass clarinet), 2 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 2 tubas, and a percussion section of 5 players:
timpani, vibraphone, cymbals, tenor drum, claves
glockenspiel, snare, field, and tenor drums, 2 timbales or tom-toms, cymbals, cencerro, tambourine, Chinese blocks
bass drums, cymbals, field and tenor drums, cencerro, guiro, claves, tambourine, chimes
vibraphone, 3 gongs, lathes, guiro, tambourine
xylophone, chinese blocks, wooden drums, guiro, claves, maracas, lathes
Percussion instruments are exploited for their resonant potential, rather than used solely as accompaniment. According to Varèse, the title of the piece regards "not only physical deserts of sand, sea, mountains, and snow, outer space, deserted city streets… but also distant inner space… where man is alone in a world of mystery and essential solitude."
The piece was created as a soundtrack to a modernist film. According to "Blue" Gene Tyranny, "It is now recognized as an exceptional example of truly humanistic music." It "has been described… as atonal, athematic,… amotivic," and its orchestration has "been labeled subtle." As Paul Griffiths describes:
Varèse began composition in 1953 (or 1952) upon the anonymous gift of an Ampex tape recorder. Through connections in New York City, they met Ann McMillan, a young composer and music editor at RCA Red Seal, who became their assistant; McMillan recorded the sounds of factories and percussion instruments which Varèse would use in this composition. They continued to work on the piece at Pierre Schaeffer's studio at Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française in the late 1950s, and later revised it at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in the early 1960s. Dèserts may be performed without the tape sections, reducing its length by seven minutes.
The first performance of the combined orchestral and tape sound composition was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris on December 2, 1954, with Hermann Scherchen conducting and Pierre Henry in charge of the tape part. This performance was part of an ORTF broadcast concert, in front of a totally unprepared and mainly conservative audience, with Déserts wedged between pieces by Mozart and Tchaikovsky. It received a vitriolic reaction from both the audience and the press. Igor Stravinsky was complimentary of the piece, speaking favourably of the piece's "form based on patterns of recurrence and incidence". Moreover, they appreciated the attempt to combine live instrumental music with electronic recording and considered it "the most valuable development in Varèse's later music."

The party members voted on 12 April 2005, electing Thorning-Schmidt as leader with 24,261 votes (53%) against 21,348 votes (47%) for Frank Jensen. After the results, they decided not to run for the Folketing again in the next election.
In 2009 they were elected as the Social Democrats lead candidate for Lord Mayor of Copenhagen. They were elected as mayor of Copenhagen in 2009, and reelected in 2013 and 2017. In 2020 they stepped down because of several sexual harassment allegations.
Jensen is the author of several scientific papers and articles. In 2018 they stated on the online magazine Impakter.com that Copenhagen has decreased its emissions by 40% since 2005.
Controversies
In 2011, Jensen was accused of trying to lick a female coworker at a julefrokost at the Copenhagen City Hall.
In 2020, Jensen admitted that they had been sexually harassing various women in the previous ~30 years of their career.
On 19 October 2020, Jensen announced they would stop in politics and step down as Lord Mayor and Deputy Leader as a result of the allegations.

Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital is a multi-speciality hospital in Ambattur, Chennai, India. The hospital is named after Sir Ivan Stedeford, the British industrialist and philanthropist. The hospital was opened on 25 February 1966 and is managed by the AMM Foundation. It is situated 3 km from the Ambattur rail-bridge on the Ambattur–Avadi road, about a kilometer from the Ambattur—Red Hills Road intersection. The hospital has been certified with ISO 9001-2008 for Quality Health Care Service by BVQI, London in 2010.
History
The hospital was named after Sir Ivan Stedeford, chairperson of Tube Investments, U.K., who was instrumental in starting the TI factory and TII complex in India. Sir Ivan signed a joint venture agreement with A. M. Murugappa Chettiar of the Murugappa Group, which was then a small business house manufacturing sandpaper and abrasives for the war effort and also trading war surplus. It was the first joint venture agreement to be signed in South India after Independence. This resulted in the establishment of the TI Cycle factory in a mango grove in Ambattur by 1951, and manufacture of the 'Hercules India' bicycle soon began. By 1954, the word 'India' was dropped from the name when international quality standards were met.
In 1954, Sir Ivan signed their second joint venture, Tube Products India, with the Murugappa family. The factory was established on what had been the British Government of Malaya's Immigration Camp. By 1956, production was started in the new factory and soon resulted in the establishment of other TI factories in the Ambattur-Avadi industrial stretch. This led to a rapid growth in population in the region and several public amenities were established in Ambattur by TI company, such as the Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School (named after the person who had initially introduced the partners to each other), a post office and a bank. When the growing population demanded a hospital, the company decided to establish one between Ambattur and Avadi.
The other Arcot Twin, Sir Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar, was consulted for the hospital plans who suggested, "Don't give anything free; it will not be appreciated. Charge four or eight annas for an outpatient and Rs. 3 or Rs. 5 for a bed, and they'll not only pay but also appreciate what you are doing for the area."
Upon knowing the plans to build a hospital, Sir Ivan replied, "I'm delighted. And I'll do my bit. It won't be very much. I am not, as many think, a rich man. But I will gladly contribute to the project." They denoted a gift of around £5,000 and also arrived to inaugurate the hospital in 1966. AMM Charities Trust, later known as AMM Foundation, started managing the hospital. The in-patient facility in the hospital was started in 1967 with 100 beds. The bed count was increased to 125 in 1985, to 175 in 1997, and to 200 in 2000.

Wake Up Europe! () is a gathering in Brussels on 7 December 2017 in support of Catalan independence. It was organized by the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), the main civil society organisations behind the massive pro-independence demonstrations held since 2012, and Òmnium Cultural.
The number of participants that took part in the demonstration was 45,000 according to the Police Bruxelles Capitale Ixelles.
The demonstration followed similar protests in 2012, the Catalan Way (2013), the Catalan Way 2014, the Free Way to the Catalan Republic (2015), Go ahead, Catalan Republic (2016) and National Day for Yes (2017).
Representatives from a pro-independence pressure group handed over a petition with 25,000 signatures to the European Parliament. The manifesto delivered by members of the Committees for the Defense of the Republic calls on the European Union to act to achieve «the release of the political prisoners».
Background
Development
The event included the participation of Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and members of Together for Catalonia, Republican Left of Catalonia–Catalonia Yes and Popular Unity Candidacy.

Frederick William Holdsworth (born May 29, 1952 in Detroit, Michigan) is a former right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball.
Biography
Born in Detroit, Holdsworth was drafted by the Detroit Tigers as a high school senior on June 4, 1970. Although they had been class valedictorian, Holdsworth turned down several baseball and football scholarships to sign with the Tigers. When they made their debut with the Tigers on July 27, 1972, they were the youngest player in the American League. Holdsworth played three seasons for the Tigers but never won a game for the team, going 0–5 in 15 appearances.
On May 29, 1975, the Tigers traded Holdsworth to the Baltimore Orioles for Bob Reynolds. Holdsworth did not play at the major league level in 1975, but they became an effective relief pitcher with good control in a partial season for Baltimore in 1976, compiling a 4–1 record and saving two with a 2.04 ERA (Adjusted ERA+ of 160) in 16 games.
After a rocky start in 12 appearances in 1977, the Orioles traded them to the Montreal Expos on their 25th birthday—May 29, 1977. Holdsworth pitched well for the Expos in 1977, going 3–3 with a 3.19 ERA (119 Adjusted ERA+). Holdsworth's ERA ballooned to 7.27 in six games with the 1978 Expos, and they were released on January 17, 1979.
The Tigers signed Holdsworth as a free agent on February 20, 1979, but they did not make the major league roster in 1979. On December 4, 1979, the Tigers sold Holdsworth to the Milwaukee Brewers. They finished their major league career playing in nine games, with a 4.58 ERA and no decisions, for the 1980 Brewers. After retiring from baseball, Holdsworth became an accountant. In August 2005, they were elevated to vice president of finance at Comcast Cable's Midwest division in Bingham Farms, Michigan.

Walter Inglis Anderson (September 29, 1903 – November 30, 1965) was an American painter and writer.
Anderson died from cancer November 30, 1965, at the age of 62.
Early life and education
Anderson was born in New Orleans to George Walter Anderson, a grain broker, and Annette McConnell Anderson, a prominent New Orleans family member who had studied art at Newcomb College. They were the second of three brothers, the eldest being Peter Anderson and the youngest James McConnell "Mac" Anderson.
As a child, Anderson attended St. John's School in Manilus, New York until their schooling was interrupted at age 14 by World War I. They then transferred to the Manual Training School in New Orleans, Louisiana.
In 1922 they enrolled at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (now Parsons School of Design). After a year at Parsons, they won a scholarship to study at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Here (1924–1928) they would study under iconoclastic modernists like Henry McCarter, Hugh Breckenridge, and Arthur Carles, winning a Packard Award for their animal drawing and a Cresson Traveling Scholarship, which allowed them to spend a summer in France. While in France, Anderson was particularly impressed with cave paintings, which noticeably influenced their drawing style.
Ocean Springs
Anderson's older brother Peter opened the Shearwater Pottery Factory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi in 1928, on a 24-acre parcel of property their parents had purchased in 1918.
Anderson moved to Ocean Springs after their years at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and worked as a designer in the family business, Shearwater Pottery. In 1928-29 they designed their earliest ceramic pieces: pelican and crab bookends, lampstands, peculiar "Resting" and "Sitting Geometric Cat"; a "Horse and Rider" and innumerable plates and vases. Their work as a designer and decorator at Shearwater Pottery from 1928 until their death, included incised pieces, sgraffito work, underglaze decoration, woodcarvings of saints, and designs for furniture.
Among their early projects, launched with their younger brother James ("Mac"), was a "Shearwater Pottery Annex" which produced inexpensive figurines, giving Anderson enough of an income in 1932 to marry Agnes Grinstead an art history graduate of Radcliffe College, who would later write a poignant memoir of their life together (Approaching the Magic Hour). During the early years, manufacturing of the figurines, which they called "widgets", prevented Anderson from painting and led to considerable tension.
In 1934, commissioned by a family friend, Ellsworth Woodward, Anderson painted an ambitious mural in the auditorium of the Ocean Springs Public School ("Ocean Springs Past and Present") as part of Public Works of Art Project. Paintings from this period include: "Indians Hunting"; "Jockeys Riding Horses"; four oil portraits of Sissy, 1933–37; "Black Skimmer"; "Androcles and Lion"; "Man on Horse"; and Birth of Achilles (Memphis Brooks Museum of Art); along with watercolors of flowers, animals, and birds; studies for a projected book on birds of the southeastern U.S.; and linoleum blockprints, including "Tourist Cards;" "Alphabet"; nursery rhymes; "On the River"; "Valkyries"; "Butterfly Book"; and scenes from Shearwater Pottery. Designs for a second mural, in the Jackson, Mississippi, Court House, were accepted by an illustrious committee then rejected by a Washington bureaucrat, causing Anderson considerable frustration. This disappointment, coupled with the death of their father in 1937, lingering bouts of both malaria and undulant fever, and the struggle to eke out a living with work they detested (manufacturing figurines) led to a mental breakdown, with psychotic episodes, in 1937.
Oldfields
In 1941, Anderson moved to Gautier, Mississippi, to live on their wife's father's estate (Oldfields) with their family. An extraordinarily productive period followed. Freed from their work at the Pottery, they had time to draw, paint and make block prints; to illustrate some of their favorite books; to experiment with theories of dynamic symmetry and with the drawing methods of the Mexican artist and educator Adolfo Best Maugard; and to translate from Spanish part of Jose Pijoan's history of art (probably without realizing that the work had already been translated into English).
Horn Island
The Oldfields period came to an end in 1945 when they left their family and moved back to a cottage at Shearwater. From then until their death in 1965 they lived a reclusive life, working as a decorator at the Pottery and making frequent excursions in a rowboat sometimes rigged with a sail, from Ocean Springs to Horn Island, Mississippi, where they lived in primitive conditions and portrayed the life around them - birds, sea creatures, animals, trees, landscapes - in radiant watercolors and in a series of logbooks. They also ventured abroad to Costa Rica and China, and made numerous bicycle trips, on some of which they traveled for thousands of miles. "The wheels are turning again", they once wrote. "A bicycle seems to leave no room for other evils, or goods for that matter. It is an inclusive and exclusive wheel."
One of their greatest works from this period is a series of murals in the Ocean Springs Community House. Along one wall, they painted the landing in Ocean Springs of the 17th-century French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. Along the opposite wall they painted what they called the "Seven Climates", in the sense of "a belt of the earth's surface contained between two given parallels of latitude." The Gulf Coast - Ocean Springs in particular - is seen as a microcosm of these climates, each of which Anderson associates with a corresponding celestial body and with a season of the year: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, beginning with Mercury and ending with Uranus. Anderson must also have been aware of the doctrine that the seven planetary spheres, with their different tones, produce a celestial music. Around the same time, Anderson painted murals along the wooden walls of a padlocked room in their cottage at Shearwater. These murals, now called the Shearwater Cottage Murals, were discovered after their death and are inspired by Psalm 104. They are a radiant hymn to light and to the beauty of one day on the Coast, beginning on the east wall with sunrise and continuing around the room through noon, sunset and night. Both murals may be seen at the 'Walter Anderson Museum of Art.
When the Brooklyn Museum invited them to an exhibition of their linoleum block prints in 1948, they chose instead to travel to China, where they hoped to gaze upon unknown landscapes and examine Tibetan murals (the China trip ended, deep inland, when their passport and other belongings were stolen and Anderson returned, partly on foot, to their point of departure in Hong Kong.)
Walter Anderson as a writer
Among Anderson's most vivid writings are logbooks recording their travels by bicycle to New York City (1942); New Orleans (1943); Texas (1945); China (1949); Costa Rica (1951); and Florida (1960); an account of their life among the pelican colonies of North Key, in the Chandeleurs; and about 90 journals of their trips to Horn Island, off the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, in which they combine close observation of the natural world with reflection on art and nature. Another noteworthy log describes a walking tour to a colony of sand- hill cranes north of Gautier, Mississippi, in January 1944.
After hurricane Katrina
Anderson's work (his family's collection) was partially destroyed when Hurricane Katrina struck Ocean Springs in 2005, and the storm surge penetrated the small cinderblock building that had been built after Hurricane Camille to house safely those of their works owned by their family. There was extensive water damage to the watercolors, drawings, manuscripts, and other objects that were kept there, and much of this work, from the Anderson Family collection, was dried and removed to Mississippi State University. Some has been restored by conservator Margaret Moreland.

Archips betulana is a moth of the family Tortricidae. It is found from Fennoscandia south to Italy, Austria and Slovakia and from the Netherlands and Belgium east to southern Russia and the eastern part of the Palearctic realm.
It is extinct in Great Britain, where it was only known from damp heathland in the neighbourhood of King's Lynn in Norfolk. It was first recorded in around 1881 and was last seen around 1900.
Its wingspan is 18–28 mm and it can be found in August hiding amongst foliage.
The larvae feed between spun leaves, on birch (Betula species), Hazel (Corylus species), bog-myrtle (Myrica gale) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). The larvae can be found from May to June.

Solid bodies in contact that undergo shear relative motion (friction) radiate energy. Part of this energy is radiated directly into the surrounding fluid media, and another part radiates throughout the solid bides and the connecting boundary conditions. The coupling of structural vibration and acoustic radiation takes is rooted in the mechanism of atomic oscillations, by which kinetic energy is translated to thermal energy.
This field involves principles of acoustics, solid mechanics, contact dynamics, and tribology.
Coupling and Stick-Slip
Vibrational energy induced by either kinetic or breakaway friction can cause modal excitation of a subset of the contacting bodies or the vibratory coupling of the multiple bodies, depending on the strength of coupling.
Friction noise can be the product of multiple distinct dynamic processes, sliding and stick-slip. Sliding generally leads to stick-slip under a decreasing friction-velocity relation, or other unstable oscillations.
Weak Contact
When normal forces are low, the solid bodies vibratory modes are weakly excited. The resulting noise generated is known as roughness noise. This noise is largely broad-band near the surface, and radiation efficiency and material geometry dictates which frequency content is radiated into the far field.
Surfaces that are relatively smooth, or well-lubricated, low normal forces, and low relative velocities are prone to set conditions for this regime, and avoid stick-slip.
Strong Contact
Under some conditions, the radiated energy is high at the mechanical eigenmodes of the coupled system. This condition are more likely under higher roughness, higher normal loads, and higher relative sliding velocities.
Empirical Relationships
A review of observed relationships between sound pressure due to friction and parameters such as normal force, roughness, and sliding velocity is provided by Feng et al.

Sevastopol radar station was a Soviet radar station providing early warning of ballistic missile attack. It is located between the Cape of Chersones and the auxiliary airfield "Chersones" (Marine Aviation of the Black Sea Fleet) in Sevastopol and was part of the Soviet missile attack warning system. Information from this station could be used for a launch on warning nuclear missile attack or to engage the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system.
The radar occupies a site 1 km long overlooking the Black Sea. Nearby there is a former Soviet Navy dolphinarium and a former airfield. When the station was built it was in the then-closed town of Sevastopol, in the Ukrainian SSR.
Radar
The radar is a Dnepr (NATO name "Hen House") phased array radar. It consists of a central building and two long wings over 250 metres long; each wing is a separate radar array. One had an azimuth of 172° (facing south) and the other 230° (facing south-east). The radar had a range of covering southern Europe, North Africa and parts of the Middle East.
Construction began on the radar in the late 1960s. Some sources say that it started operating in 1975, others say it became fully operational on 16 January 1979.
Dispute with Ukraine
In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed and the station ended up in the newly independent country of Ukraine, together with the radar in Mukachevo. Russia signed a 15-year agreement with Ukraine in 1992 to rent both radars for $840,000 USD per year, although unlike other overseas stations the radar was to be staffed by Ukrainians not Russians. In 2005 management of the radars was transferred from the military to the civil Ukrainian National Space Agency and the rent increased to $1.3 million, although Ukraine asked for more.
In 2008 Russia decided to stop using information from the two Ukrainian radar stations. According to some commentators it was partly because of the then Ukrainian government's stated intention to join NATO. In 2007 the then commander of the Russian Space Forces, Vladimir Popovkin, stated that Russia intended to duplicate or replace foreign radar stations as it could not rely on them in times of crisis. Replacing the station would reduce any leverage Ukraine was gaining over Russia from its ability to control access to the data.
Pragmatic reasons were given for ending the lease. Popovkin said that the radars went out of warranty in 2005, and would cost $20m to modernise. In addition Russia said that the data from Sevastopol was unreliable due to interference from unlicensed radio broadcasts from fishing boats in the Black Sea. Furthermore, it had concerns with the quality of the data due to the civilian rather than military operators.
Data from Ukraine stopped on 26 February 2009 and Russia declared that a new Voronezh radar station in Armavir had begun operation on the same date, replacing the lost coverage. Following this the Ukrainian government announced that the stations would be closed for a month for maintenance and then used part-time for space surveillance, being part of an organisation called SKAKO (Automatic System of Control and Analysis of Outer Space).
Returning to Russia
Following the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the new Russian administration announced it was considering having the site modernized and fully re-opened by 2018. This is to offset the threat of the NATO radar site in Romania, as the Mk-41 launchers there are capable of launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, which Russia says violates the 1987 INF Treaty. However due to the age of the system and its derelict state that timetable appears not to have been met, no reopening announcement having been made by December 2019.

Anikó Zsíros Jankelić (; born 25 February 1967) is a politician in Serbia. They have served at different times in the National Assembly of Serbia and the Assembly of Vojvodina as a member of the Democratic Party (Demokratska stranka, DS).  They are now a member of Municipal Assembly of Senta, serving with the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (Vajdasági Magyar Szövetség, VMSZ).
Early life and private career
Zsíros Jankelić was born in Senta, in what was then the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  They are a teacher of physical education, has taught rhythmic gymnastics, and has worked at the School of Economics and Trade in Senta.
Politician
Parliamentarian and local assembly speaker
Zsíros Jankelić was elected to the Senta municipal assembly in the 2004 Serbian local elections and was chosen as its president (i.e. speaker) for the term that followed. They led the DS's electoral list in Senta for the 2008 local elections and received a new mandate after the list won nine seats. When the assembly convened, they were chosen for a second term as its president.
The Democratic Party contested the 2008 Serbian parliamentary election, which was held concurrently with the local elections, as the dominant party in the For a European Serbia alliance; Zsíros Jankelić was given the forty-eighth position on the alliance's list. The list won 102 seats, and they were not initially included in their party's assembly delegation. (From 2000 to 2011, mandates in Serbian parliamentary elections were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for the mandates to be distributed out of numerical order. Zsíros Jankelić's position on the list had no specific bearing on their chances of election.) The overall results of the election were initially inconclusive, but For a European Serbia eventually formed a coalition government with the Socialist Party of Serbia (Socijalistička partija Srbije, SPS).
On 18 December 2009, Zsíros Jankelić was awarded a parliamentary mandate as the replacement for Nandor Maraci, a fellow DS member from the North Banat District who had died. They served as a supporter of the administration for the remainder of the term. At the local level in Senta, they called a vote of non-confidence in VMSZ mayor Zoltán Pék that led to a change of government in February 2010.<ref>"'Razlaz' DS-a i SVM u Senti", Radio Television of Vojvodina, 16 February 2010, accessed 29 November 2021.</ref> The DS formed a new government in the municipality, and, in the shifting of personnel that followed, Zsíros Jankelić stood down as assembly president. They continued to serve in the local assembly.The municipality's official gazette reported that they were chosen as assembly vice-president the following month, although this is not indicated in municipality's website from this period. See Službeni List (Opštine Senta), Volume 45 Number 7 (31 March 2010), p. 31; Zenta Község Önkormányzata , Municipality of Senta, 14 August 2010, accessed 28 November 2021.
Provincial representative and after
Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that mandates in elections held under proportional representation were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Zsíros Jankelić did not seek re-election at the republic level in 2012 but was instead elected for the Senta constituency seat in that year's provincial election in Vojvodina. The DS and its allies won the election, and they again served as supporter of the administration. They also appeared in the second position on the DS's list in the 2012 local elections and was re-elected when the list won ten mandates. During their term in the provincial assembly, Zsíros Jankelić served as vice-president of the Board of Directors of the Sports Federation of Vojvodina. In 2014, when there was a chance of the provincial government falling, they were a member of the DS's negotiating team with other parties to establish a new administration.
They attempted to return to the national assembly in the 2016 Serbian parliamentary election, appearing in the twenty-fourth position on the DS's list. The list won only sixteen mandates and they were not re-elected. They also led the DS's list in the concurrent local election in Senta and was elected when the list won five mandates. The VMSZ formed a coalition government with the Serbian Progressive Party (Srpska napredna stranka'', SNS) after the election, and the DS served in opposition.
In 2020, Zsíros Jankelić made the somewhat unusual move from the DS to the VMSZ. This occurred against the backdrop of a DS election boycott. They were not given a strong position on the VMSZ's electoral list for Senta in the 2020 local elections, appearing in the seventeenth position, and they were not initially re-elected when the list won thirteen mandates. The VMSZ won the election and formed another coalition government with the SNS, however, and a number of party delegates resigned to take positions in government; Zsíros Jankelić was given a new mandate as a replacement member on 21 June 2020. They currently serve as a supporter of the local administration.

Miss Dominican Republic (Spanish: Miss República Dominicana) is a national beauty pageant in the Dominican Republic.
History
Miss Dominican Republic Organization has been in operation since 1927. In 1956, the pageant was officially restarted after crowning models from 1952 until 1955. In 1956, Olga Fiallo from Santiago won, making the Dominican Republic's first representative to Miss Universe. In 1966, the Concurso Nacional de Belleza Dominicana lost its Miss Universe rights for only one year but on that same year it gained their Miss World franchise sending the winner of that year, Jeanette Dotel from San Juan as their first representative. In 1967, the organization officially decided that the Winner would go to Miss Universe, First Runner-up would enter Miss World and Second Runner-up to a Festival of Latin Beauties in South America. The MRD organization had acquired the Miss International rights, but the organization would only send a representative if the budget allowed them. It wasn't until 1980, when they decided that the Second Runner-up would enter either in Miss International, Reinado Nacional del Café or Miss América Latina. In 1989 until 2000, the official Second Runner-up would enter Miss International, the Third Runner-up would enter Reinado Nacional del Café and the Fourth Runner-up would enter Miss América Latina. This has been the same until 2003 when the organization separated into two separate organizations.
Miss República Dominicana Universo Organization
The Miss República Dominicana Universo Organization was created in 2003 by Belkys Reyes, and was taken over by Magali Febles in 2004. Since 2003, the representatives of the Dominican Republic for one out of the four major international pageants have been selected by this organization. This organization is in charge of sending representatives to Miss Universe. Miss República Dominicana Universo competes in Miss Universe. Also, this organization has 15 franchises in other international competitions and sends representatives to these competitions every year such as Reina Hispanoamericana and Miss Continentes Unidos.
Reina Nacional de Belleza Dominicana Organization
The organization of Reina Nacional de Belleza Dominicana was created in 2003 by Diany Mota, and is still run by them today. Since 2003, the representatives of the Dominican Republic for three out of the four major international pageants have been selected by this organization, until in 2015 when they lost the Miss Earth franchise. This organization is in charge of sending representatives to Miss World and Miss International. Miss Mundo Dominicana competes in Miss World and Miss Internacional Dominicana competes in Miss International.

History
It was formerly the Westfield Development Centre of British Gas. In 1992 Fife Energy bought the site in a £10m deal. A combined-cycle gas turbine plant began commercial operation in January 2001.
It was purchased in 2004 by Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) for £12.3 million, temporarily securing the future of the 10 staff who worked there at the time.
Investigations took place in 2007 into the feasibility of burning used car tyres in Fife, environmental legislations precluded this however.
The plant closed in March 2011.

The ICC Women's Under-19 Cricket World Cup is an international cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) contested by the national women's under-19 teams. The first tournament is scheduled to be held in January 2023 in South Africa, with matches being played in the T20 format.
History
Originally, the tournament was scheduled to take place in January 2021, before being moved back to December 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, the ICC looked at the possibility of deferring the tournament from its scheduled slot of January 2021 to later in the year. In January 2021, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed that they would host the tournament in December 2021, however the tournament was postponed for a second time, and was moved to January 2023. In January 2022, Geoff Allardice, the CEO of the ICC said that the tournament was "very much on the cards", and that the ICC were starting the process for hosts.

Blakumen or Blökumenn were a people mentioned in Scandinavian sources dating from the 11th through 13th centuries. The name of their land, Blokumannaland, has also been preserved. Victor Spinei, Florin Curta, Florin Pintescu and other historians identify them as Romanians (variation of the exonym Vlach), while Omeljan Pritsak argues that they were Cumans. Judith Jesch adds the possibility that the terms meant "black men", the meaning of which is unclear. Historians identify Blokumannaland as the lands south of the Lower Danube which were inhabited by Vlachs in the Middle Ages, adding that the term may refer to either Wallachia (to the north of the Danube) or Africa in the modern Icelandic language.
Blakumen on runestone G134
The only preserved example of the variant Blakumen of the ethnonym was an inscription on a runestone in the Sjonhem cemetery in Gotland in Sweden. The forms of the runes on the memorial stone suggest that it was raised in approximately 1050 AD. According to its inscription, a Varangian couple named Hróðvísl and Hróðelfr set up the stone in memory of one of their sons, Hróðfúss, who had been treacherously killed by Blakumen while traveling abroad. Although the inscription does not contain more information about the crime, Spinei expands on the inscription, arguing that Hróðfúss was murdered by Vlachs in the regions east of the Carpathian Mountains. Curta proposes that Hróðfúss was a merchant traveling towards Constantinople, who was attacked and killed by Vlachs north of the Lower Danube. Jesch likewise suggests that Hróðfúss was a merchant "on a voyage abroad", and assumes that they were murdered by local merchants who betrayed their trust. Jesch translates Blakumen as Vlachs, confronting their treachery with their untrustworthiness as claimed by Kekaumenos. Jesch also allows for the possibility that the term may have meant "black men", in which case the meaning is unclear. Pritsak refuses to identify the Blakumen in the inscription with Vlachs, instead stating that they were Cumans, whose migration towards the westernmost regions of the Pontic steppes began around the time when the memorial stone was erected. Spinei counters this view on account of the fact that several mentions of the Blakumen or Blökumen (for instance in the Eymund's Saga) occur in contexts taking place decades before the earliest appearance of the Cumans in the Pontic steppe. Spinei also says that if understood as meaning "Black Cumans", then the term is not concordant with the Varangian ethnic terminology (derived from either Germanic or East-Slavic naming traditions), that it is not attested in mirror forms in other languages (such as *cumani nigri in Latin or *mauro Koumanoi in Greek), and that the juxtaposition of a Scandinavian adjective and a proper name of Greek or Latin origin (at the expense of the German Walven designating Cumans) to produce Blakumen ("black Cumans") and Blokumannaland ("the land of the black Cumans") is highly improbable.
Blökumenn in the Flatey Book
Blökumen are mentioned in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. They argue that the reference to the Tyrkir and Blökumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs when they decided to go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.
Blokumannaland
Blokumannaland is a territory mentioned in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla ("The Circle of the World") from the 13th century. The book narrates how the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, referred to by the name Kirjalax, invaded Blokumannaland where they fought against pagan tribes. Since these pagans have not been identified, there is disagreement as to the actual date of the Byzantine invasion. For instance, Spinei identifies the events prescribed in the Heimskringla with the Battle of Levounion of 1091 AD, which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Pechenegs by the Byzantines. They argue that Blokumannaland refers to a territory inhabited by Vlachs south of the Lower Danube. On the other hand, Sandaaker proposes that the battle took place in 1040 AD, while the latest date of 1122 AD was proposed by Ellis Davidson and Blöndal. Alexandru Madgearu says that Sturluson anachronistically mentioned the lands south of the Danube as Blokummanaland, because the latter term referred to the Second Bulgarian Empire in Sturluson's time. In the modern Icelandic language, the term Blokumannaland may refer to either Wallachia or Africa.

The role of an asynchronous communication mechanism (ACM) is to synchronize the transfer of data in a system between a writing process and a reading process operating concurrently.
Description
The mechanism by which the ACM performs its tasks varies heavily depending upon the situation in which the ACM is employed. A possible scenario is the writer outputs data at a higher rate than the reader can process it. Without an ACM, one of two things will happen:
If the system incorporates a buffer between processes (e.g., a Unix shell pipe), then data will accumulate and be processed at the reader's maximum rate. There are some circumstances in which this is a desirable characteristic (e.g. piping a file over SSH, or if all data in the set is important, and the reader's output does not need to be synchronised with the input).
If it is necessary to synchronize the input of the writer with the output of the reader, then the ACM can interface with the two systems, and make active decisions on how to handle each packet of information. If, for example, maximum synchronization is required, the ACM could be configured to drop packets, and output the newest packets at the reader's maximum speed.
Alternatively, if there is no buffer, some data may be lost. If this is undesirable, the ACM can provide this buffer, or process the data in such a way that minimal information is lost.

PANC-1 is a human pancreatic cancer cell line isolated from a pancreatic carcinoma of ductal cell origin.
PANC-1 was derived from the tissue of a 56-year-old male. The cells can metastasize but have poor differentiation abilities. PANC-1 cells take 52 hours to double in population, have a modal chromosome number of 63, and show G6PD of the slow mobility type. PANC-1 cells are known to have an epithelial morphology and are adherent in cell culture flasks. The cells can be frozen and regrown in culture, provided that they are appropriately warmed. Additionally, PANC-1 cells have a tendency to clump, a feature which can be avoided with trypsinization.
PANC-1 cells have been used to study the role of keratin reorganization during the migration of cancer cells, along with calcium-mediated actin reset in response to physiological changes.

Café liégeois is a Belgian cold dessert made from lightly sweetened coffee, coffee-flavoured ice cream and chantilly cream.
Refrigerate a large glass filled with the required amount of sweetened coffee, and add the ice cream and chantilly just prior to serving. Often crushed roasted coffee beans are put on top of the chantilly as decoration.
History
Contrary to its name, the café liégeois dessert did not originate in or around Liège, Belgium. It was originally known in France as a café viennois (French for "Viennese coffee"). However, during World War I, the Battle of Liège took place, which lasted much longer than the German army had anticipated it would, caused a delay in German advances towards France in 1914, allowing the French to reorganize better. In order to honor the city of Liège for its resistance, and because the city was shelled with guns from Austria (an ally of the invading Germany during the war), Paris' cafés started renaming the dessert from café viennois to café liégeois. In Liège itself, the dessert continued to be known as café viennois for a while. and in Swiss French it remains only known as café viennois.

Philipe Charles Félix Macquart, Baron de Rullecourt was a French soldier who became a general of the Kingdom of France. In 1781, they were mortally wounded commanding the attempted invasion of Jersey at the Battle of Jersey.
Biography
Philipe Charles Félix Macquart was born in Artois in a wealthy family originating in Orléans. Their title "Baron de Rullecourt" was self-bestowed, and was a soldier for hire. They were placed in command of French troops during the 1779 failed invasion of Jersey, as second-in-command to the Prince of Nassau-Siegen.
Two years later, they launched another invasion attempt on Jersey. Their second-in-command Mir Sayyad advised them to ransack the island and to kill all civilians, but instead the commander captured the governor Moses Corbet, and used them as a tool to try and engineer a British surrender. But the British soldiers on the island refused to surrender, and Philippe was mortally wounded in the following battle in which the British outnumbered the French. Rullecourt died a day later of their wounds, in the modern-day Peirson Pub. They had failed in their attempt to bluff the British into surrender.

Logobi (also written in French as Logobie) is an urban musical genre that accompanies certain dance moves. It first appeared in Côte d'Ivoire in 1986 and was popularized initially in university campuses in Abidjan. The dance is based on Côte d'Ivoire's traditional Zouglou dance with new elements added. "Zouglou" and "logobi" are used interchangeably, although "zouglou" is more ancient and "logobi" is a more modern development.
Etymology
The literal meaning of "logobi" in Nouchi (an Ivorian slang) is to earn money through cunning, crafty and often trickery means to earn a fortune. Many of the dance moves accompanying the music are depictions of bandits, hooligans and street gangs, including fight moves, use of weapons, secret gang signals and sexual overtures. The music and dance try to convey the social realities of poverty and misery aspiring at the same time to a happier, more positive future and longing for prosperity, justice and peace. It has also been dubbed "la danse des gros bras" (literally, the dance of big arms). The European, particularly French, development of "logobi" has also included electric and tecktonic elements to the music, diluting the gang aspects of the original dance by gearing it towards children and young adults.
Artists
Since its inception, the number of artists in the genre has proliferated not only in Côte d'Ivoire and neighboring African countries but in Europe, and particularly France, most notably within the African immigrant communities. Well-known artists playing "logobi" music include Les Garagistes, Espoir 2000, Magic System, Petit Yodé and l'Enfant Siro, Molière, Les Pivoines, Les Patrons, Les Mercenaires, Anti Palu, Sur-choc, Les Salopard, Dezy Champillon, Major and Zabson, C ki'sa, LogobiGT and Yang Systeme.
Successful singles and music videos include the hits "Djolo National" by Yang Systeme, "Logobi" by Les Mantanien, and "Logobi" by Les Youlés.

Malla is a 2004 Indian Kannada-language film written, directed, composed and enacted by Ravichandran in dual roles. The film also stars Priyanka Trivedi and Mohan Shankar. The film was produced by Ramu for their home banner Ramu Enterprises making theirs the first team up with Ravichandran.
The film found a widespread release across Karnataka state on 27 February 2004 and was declared a blockbuster at the box office. However, it received mixed response by the critics who claimed that the film highlights the unwanted intimacy scenes, as well as the great relationship between husband and wife, other than the romantic part of Shiva Rama Krishna, the associate of TFI Puri Jaganadh, has shown the great relationship between husband and wife that attracted woman audience to watch this movie again and again. The film is also reportedly the first to introduce the famous Kerala based traditional art Kalarippayattu in Kannada cinema. The stunt master K. D. Venkatesh was awarded in a special category at the 2003–04 Karnataka State Film Awards.
Plot
The film is all about Malla - a florist, a Samaritan, soft-natured person beloved by people; contrast to this is their son Shiva who grows-up in goons' abode; a father who sacrifices their lives for their son and at the end son taking revenge on the culprits. Malla reminds us of their earlier films Anjada Gandu and Puntanja in some sequences. This film has everything from love to trust, affection, sorrow, action, cruelty, comedy and glamour to make Malla a tasty feast for all classes. Known for unusual ideas and sets, they demonstrated them here too - they sleep on a hand shaped bed and makes out with the beauty.

Malla was produced by Ramu, under their production house, while Ravichandran directed it. They stated: "The audience can expect to see the earlier Ravichandran in Malla. The film will have all gimmicks and heroisms of a Ravichandran-starrer and I want the cine-goers to take something back home after seeing the film. The film will touch the hearts of all the cine-goers. It will entertain, make people laugh and cry." They added that they would star as the eponymous lead Mallikarjuna "Malla", who has a love for flowers. They further said the film would have six tracks, and that Priyanka Upendra would star opposite him, as a girl "who comes from abroad and becomes a village girl." Ravichandran wrote the film's story and lyrics for three tracks, and co-wrote the screenplay with J. K. Bharavi, while actor Mohan Shankar wrote the dialogues.

The Chełmno trials were a series of consecutive war-crime trials of the Chełmno extermination camp personnel, held in Poland and in Germany following World War II. The cases were decided almost twenty years apart. The first judicial trial of the former SS men – members of the SS-Sonderkommando Kulmhof – took place in 1945 at the District Court in Łódź, Poland. The subsequent four trials, held in Bonn, Germany, began in 1962 and concluded three years later, in 1965 in Cologne.
A number of camp officials, gas-van operators and SS guards, were arraigned before the court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed at Chełmno (a.k.a. Kulmhof) in occupied Poland in the period between December 1941 and January 1945. The evidence against the accused, including testimonies by surviving witnesses, former prisoners, and mechanics attending to repair needs of the SS, was examined in Poland by Judge Władysław Bednarz of the Łódź District Court (Sąd Okręgowy w Łodzi). Three convicted defendants were sentenced to death, including the camp deputy commandant Oberscharführer Walter Piller (wrongly, Filer); the gas van operator Hauptscharführer Hermann Gielow (Gilow), as well as Bruno Israel from Ordnungspolizei (Order Police), their sentence was later commuted to life. All three were members of the SS Special Detachment Kulmhof responsible for the extermination of Jews and non-Jews during the Holocaust in occupied Poland.
In the years 1962–65, a dozen SS-men from Kulmhof were arraigned before the German court (Landgericht) in Bonn, RFN. They were charged with the murder of 180,000 Jews in the camp. The jury deliberations continued for three years, with sentences ranging from 13 months and 2 weeks to 13 years' imprisonment. Half of the defendants were cleared of all charges and released by Germany.
1945 Chełmno Trial in Poland
After liberation by the Soviet Army, the new government of Poland began its official investigation into the Chełmno war crimes on May 24, 1945. Although most Germans fled, Piller and Gielow were soon captured by the Soviets and brought back.
Notably, the trial of Holocaust perpetrators from Chełmno was unlike any other war-crimes trial, because the camp had been essentially eradicated by the SS, along with most traces of the mass murder. Truckloads of ashes of its victims were dumped in the Warta river daily, the "palace" was blown up with rubble removed to foundations, mobile gas-chambers and loot were driven back to Berlin, written records were destroyed, including train departure records. There was nothing to see for the commissars, or draw interest. Some of the key evidence was mistakenly discarded in the trash in 1945 (i.e. over 5,000 pairs of damaged shoes from a destroyed synagogue in Koło), or hauled away as usable materials, including wooden fencing and cremation grids; few people were aware of its importance. By comparison, other former death camps were overflowing with direct evidence of war-crimes, as in the case of the Majdanek trial decided several months before.
Judge Bednarz soon ordered excavation of the waste in a Schlosslager burn pit. About 24,200 spoons, 4,500 knives, and 2,500 forks were found, among pots, pans, eyeglasses and many other half-burned items in the debris. It was also known that most of the victims were Jews from the Łódź Ghetto, where chronicles of ghetto operations were found; in addition, non-Jewish Poles, Soviet prisoners, about 5,000 Gypsies, and whole transports of children had been deported to Chełmno where they were murdered. The SS Master Sergeant Walter Piller testified about the final phase of the camp operation, including 1944 deportations from Łódź. To circumvent the Nazi destruction of records and evidence, Judge Bednarz used Łódź ghetto records and estimates to arrive at the number of victims. Based on ghetto statistics together with testimonies, they estimated some 350,000 victims. They did not account for the period of camp inactivity. The range of estimated victims presented at the 1962 trial in Bonn was 180,000 with 152,000 as the lowest acceptable number.
The first Chełmno trial in Poland established many critical details from the camp history, but also revealed the operation of mobile gas chambers, which used exhaust fumes as the killing agent, diverted into sheet metal-lined vans. The names of SS officials and commanders at the camp were established, including the SS-Hauptsturmführer Herbert Lange and the SS-Hauptsturmführer Hans Bothmann who had vanished. Both men were later found to have committed suicide.
Survivor testimonies
Judge Władysław Bednarz, assisted by the Deputy Recording Clerk, heard testimonies of key witnesses including Szymon (Simon) Srebrnik (age fifteen), who survived being shot in the head during the Germans' last execution of Jews at the camp, and Michał (Mordechaï) Podchlebnik, who escaped in 1942 into the surrounding forest from the burial Sonderkommando. Podchlebnik testified on June 9, 1945. They were at the camp for 10 days digging mass graves in January 1942 at the time of the Nazi Aktion Reinhard. The cremation process was implemented there a year later.
The second survivor from the Jewish Sonderkommando, Szymon Srebrnik, was from Łódź and 15 years old at the end of the war. They testified on June 29, 1945 in Koło; they were not under oath, although informed of criminal liability for a false statement. Srebnik worked at the forest camp during the second extermination phase, when the bodies were cremated after being delivered in the gas-vans.
The defendants
On October 29/30, 1945, Judge Władysław Bednarz questioned German Oberwachtmeister Bruno Israel (born Bruno Koenig), employed at the final phase of the Chełmno extermination. They were accused of committing crimes against the Polish nation under the PKWN Decree of August 31, 1944 pertaining to Nazi War Criminals (the so-called Sierpniówka. This provided for the death penalty without direct appeal). The defendant claimed to be not guilty.
Bruno Israel testified the following:
Although Bruno Israel was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death, the Polish President Bolesław Bierut granted them clemency in September 1946, commuting their sentence to life. Israel was released conditionally for five years in November 1958, and was never required to return to prison.
Statutory death sentences were given to other two defendants, who were found guilty. Both Walter Piller and Hermann Gielow applied for a presidential pardon, which they were not granted. After a few years spent on death row, Walter Piller was executed on January 19, 1949. Herman Gielow was executed in the Poznań Prison on June 6, 1951. The very Decree of August 31, 1944 used in their sentencing was amended in December 1946, making the laws not applicable from the outset, in connection with the Soviet World War II crimes in Poland.
Chełmno Trials in Germany 1962–1965
Eleven indicted suspects from Chełmno were arraigned at the Special Criminal Court in Bonn, RFN (Landgericht Bonn) in 1962–1965 on charges of complicity to the murder of 180,000 Jews. A total of four trials were held. Later observers referred to at least one of them as a judicial farce. Genocide was not in the criminal code of Nazi Germany and the court ruled that it could not be applied retroactively. Depositions were not sufficient to secure convictions. There was little physical evidence remaining at the crime scene. No victims' bodies to examine: their ashes had been carried downriver and out to sea.
The most severe penalties of 15 years were given to Gustav Laabs, SS Hauptscharführer, a gas van operator, and Alois Häfele, SS Untersturmführer, a camp Hauskommando leader. The latter's sentence was reduced by two years on appeal because they reportedly gave cigarettes to some of the walking dead. Half of the defendants were cleared of all charges and released. Oberscharführer Gustaw Fiedler, from Polizeiwachtkommando, was tried in 1965 in Cologne and sentenced to 13½ months imprisonment.

The first camp commandant, SS Sturmbannführer Herbert Lange, was killed in action on April 20, 1945, near Berlin. The second head of Chełmno, Hauptsturmführer Hans Bothmann who made substantial improvements to the killing method in the final phase of the camp operation, committed suicide in British custody in April 1946.
Poland 2001
The last person charged in connection with the crimes at Chełmno was a Pole, Henryk Mania. They were one of eight Polish prisoners who worked with the camp Sonderkommando. Mania had been originally imprisoned after being accused of attempting to poison a German. These eight prisoners has previously worked at a sonderkommando at Fort VII prison where they would dispose of dead prisoners. The men were then transferred to Chełmno after being selected by Herbert Lange Fifty-six years after the end of World War II, they were convicted as an accessory to murder.
Their investigation, begun in 1956, was renewed in 1991 by the Institute of National Remembrance. They were tried in a 2001 court case in Poznań. The collapse of several communist regimes and release of new records made it possible. Mania was found guilty of helping to load prisoners into gas-vans and collecting their watches and jewellery, which they also stole for himself. They were sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, with consideration given to their advanced age.

Sonnet 111 is one of 154 sonnets written by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses their love towards a young man.
Synopsis
The youth chides the goddess of fortune for providing for the poet nothing better than the public's / common people's applause. For this success the poet has to make their living in the public sphere, what is a shame. In doing so they are degraded, and almost finds themselves sullied like a professional dyer stained with their dyes. They ask the youth to hope the poet will be regenerated after taking cleansing medicine against their infection. No medicine will be too bitter, but the youth's pity will be the most effective cure.
Structure
Sonnet 111 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 4th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:
× / × / × / × / × /
Than public means which public manners breeds. (111.4)
Line 10 has two common metrical variations, an initial reversal and a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending:
/ × × / × / × / × / (×)
Potions of eisell 'gainst my strong infection; (111.10)
/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. (×) = extrametrical syllable.
Lines 12, 13, and 14 also have feminine endings. Lines 8, 13, and 14 also have initial reversals, and they potentially occur in lines 1, 3, and 9.
The meter demands that line 14's "even" function as one syllable.

H&E naturist (originally Health and Efficiency) is a 92-page monthly commercial magazine focusing on the naturist lifestyle, through articles on travel, health and culture, as well as various features on arts and books with a naked theme. This content and focus has sometimes caused it to be accused of appealing to consumers of pornography, although sexual nudity is absent from its pages.
History
For decades, Health & Efficiency claimed to have been first published in 1900. The first issue under this name was actually in 1918, when Health & Vim changed its name. That magazine probably derived from Vim, first published in 1902. These magazines covered health topics such as diet, exercise, herbalism and general advice on living a healthy and efficient life.
In the 1920s when nudists began publicising their activities and sun clubs began to form, Health & Efficiency became an early champion of their cause through publishing their letters, articles and photos. Later, this material occupied a greater proportion of the magazine, particularly as it absorbed other naturist and health periodicals, including Sunbathing and Health Magazine, with naturism becoming a main focus in the early 1930s.
After the Second World War, nudism became more popular and the monthly H&E - as it became known - promoted the lifestyle option, and throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s the magazine's reputation as the "nudist bible" grew. H&Es audience was made up of nudists who were members of British clubs and those who used British beaches. A small minority who were able to afford holidays abroad, and sampled French and Yugoslavian nudist facilities, provided H&E with the first "naturists abroad" travel reports. By the 1970s, cheaper foreign travel allowed many more British naturists to visit the south of France, Spain, Greece and Yugoslavia. H&E reflected this change and soon became an international naturist magazine providing news, travel reports, features and photography from around the naturist world.
Over its long history, notable photographers such as Walter Bird, Stephen Glass, Bertram Park and Yvonne Gregory have worked for the magazine.
The magazine has had a number of publishers and editors, and has been based in London, Epsom, Goole and Hull.
Editorial
The editorial staff were anonymous before George Greenwood tenure as editor. The magazine had a sole editor until 1991, when their editorial was restructured. Kate Sturdy became managing editor and Jane Hendy-Smith took over as editor. Additionally, several other editorial staff were added, including editors for the German and French versions of the magazine. It has since returned to a single editor.

Appearances in popular culture
The magazine makes several appearances in an episode of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small. "In 'If Wishes Were Horses' I used the Health and Efficiency gag. I used to love that one. From my childhood it was like, 'Wow... nudists!' So when one turned up on the set in an earlier episode, I thought, 'I've got to have Tristan reading this,'" recalled Peter Davison. Their character would leave the magazine in the surgery's waiting room in hopes of catching one of the male customers perusing it."
Health & Efficiency was also used in the British television show Allo Allo, season 7, episode 5, titled The Gestapo Ruins a Picnic. In the episode Herr Otto Flick receives their latest copy of Health and Efficiency and begins to tremble while looking at the center-fold, they then attempts to phone for the Health & Efficiency calendar. In the "Are You Being Served?" episode, "Hoorah for the Holidays," Mr. Humphries, upon hearing of Captain Peacock's nudist lifestyle, asks them if that was them "chopping down that tree in last month's Health & Efficiency." In the episode "The Club", while helping to clear out the room allocated to the department, Mr. Lucas finds a copy of the magazine printed in 1938, and briefly looks through it with Mr. Humphries.

Aminotransferase class-V is an evolutionary conserved protein domain. This domain is found in amino transferases, and other enzymes including cysteine desulphurase EC:4.4.1.-.
Aminotransferases share certain mechanistic features with other pyridoxal- phosphate dependent enzymes, such as the covalent binding of the pyridoxal- phosphate group to a lysine residue. On the basis of sequence similarity, these various enzymes can be grouped into subfamilies. This family is called class-V.

Panelház (Short: panel) is a Hungarian term for a type of concrete block of flats (panel buildings), built in the People's Republic of Hungary and other Eastern Bloc countries.
It was the main urban housing type in the Socialist-era, which still dominates the Hungarian cityscape.
According to the 2011 census, there were 829,177 panel apartments in Hungary (18.9% of the dwellings) that were home to 1,741,577 people (17.5% of the total population). Panelház are not the only type of block of flats in Hungary; as of 2014, 31.6% of Hungarians lived in flats (according to data from Eurostat).
History
After World War II a serious housing crisis developed in Hungary due to rapid population growth and urbanization. The exodus of the rural population after the collectivization in the late 1940s and the early 1950s from rural areas was particularly important as a source of migration. Budapest and other cities became overcrowded, and the Communist government eventually responded. After several study visits and conventions, in the early 1960s Hungary bought the large-panel system (LPS) from the Soviet Union and Denmark. The Danish technology was known as Larsen-Nielsen system and was a common housing method in Western Europe, Turkey, and Hong Kong. By the late 1960s, Hungarian engineers developed the country's own large-panel system (mostly based on the Soviet LPS), adapted to the Hungarian situation. The large-panel system permitted rapid construction that was not constrained by Hungary's relatively cold winters. After the 1968 Ronan Point explosion (a Larsen-Nielsen-type tower block partially collapsed in London) Hungarian engineers modified the original system, made the structure more compact and the joints stronger. The Larsen-Nielsen system was retired in Hungary in 1970.
The first, experimental panel residential building was built in Dunaújváros (new industrial city) in 1961, followed by other blocks is Pécs and Debrecen in 1963. The first precast concrete panel work was finished in 1962 in Dunaújváros, while the first large-panel system (LPS) housing factory (these works produced near all parts of these buildings, including the built-up kitchen units and the built-up wardrobes), was built in 1965 in Óbuda, Budapest. The first LPS building also was built in Óbuda in 1965.
The structure of Hungarian cities in the immediate post-war period consisted of a historic core surrounded by mostly single-story buildings and workers' houses, predominantly on unpaved streets. The nationwide public housing program of the 1960s changed this. The Communist government demolished the single-story buildings, replacing them with panel blocks. It also created new neighbourhoods on former farmland around the cities.
Panel apartments provided their inhabitants with a real improvement in living conditions. Two and three-bedroom sunny apartments with district heating, piped hot water, and flush toilets replaced what had been predominantly one-bedroom dwellings without modern conveniences. According to the 1960 census, one-bedroom flats made up 60% of the dwellings in Budapest; this had decreased to 25% in 1990. During this period, the share of dwellings with three or more bedrooms rose from 9% to 35%. The last panel building was finished in 1993.
The Hungarian government and local municipalities started renovation programs during the 2000s. These programs insulated the panel buildings, replaced the old doors and windows with multi-layer thermo glass, renovated the heating system, and gave the buildings more attractive exterior colours.
These buildings still dominate the Hungarian cityscape. The share of panel dwellings is 31% in Budapest, 39% in Debrecen, 52% in Miskolc, 38% in Szeged, 42% in Pécs, 41% in Győr, 50% in Székesfehérvár and 60% in Dunaújváros.

Statistics
According to the 2011 census, there were 829,177 panel flats in Hungary (777,263 inhabited, 51,914 tenantless, 18.9% of the dwellings overall), of whom there were 548,464 flats (66.1%) in large-panel system buildings (LPS) and 280,713 (33.9%) in precast concrete (PC) buildings (the LPS is originally unplastered, while the PC is plastered and painted). 7,423 (0.9%) flats were built before 1960, 115,471 (13.9%) in the 1960s, 396,158 (47.8%) in the 1970s, 262,004 (31.6%) in the 1980s, while 48,121 (5.8%) flats were built after 1990. These flats were home to 1,741,577 people (17.5% of the total population). There were 58,698 (7.1% of the total) one-bedroom, 421,274 (50.8%) two-bedroom, 271,422 (32.7%) three-bedroom flat, while 77,783 panel flats (9.4%) had four or more bedroom in 2011.
Average floor space was 54 m² for an LPS flat and 69 m² for a PC flat in 2011, lower than the national average (78 m²). The average floor space for a state-built flat (mostly panel flats) was 48 m² in the 1960s, 53 m² in the 1970s and 55 m² in the 1980s, significantly smaller than a privately built one (panel blocks also were built by non-governmental organizations, mostly housing cooperatives). Despite economic hardship, flats got even bigger in the late 1980s (before the fall of the Communism), the largest panel flats were built in the Káposztásmegyer housing estate of Budapest with 124 m².
The society of panel housing estates was heterogeneous until the privatization in the early 1990s (after the fall of the Communism), when the poor and the rich fled from these buildings, made them middle class characteristic. The residents of panel buildings predominantly have an above-average level of education, according to the 2011 census, 19.1% of the residents over 25 had Bachelor's degree or higher, while the national average was 17.3%.

West Stanley railway station was a railway station on the North Eastern Railway, in County Durham.
History
The loop line between and was built by the North Eastern Railway (NER), and opened for freight trains on 1 January 1886. This deviation line allowed several steep rope-worked inclines (on the former Pontop and South Shields Railway section of the old Stanhope and Tyne Railway) to be avoided. Passenger stations on the loop line, including Shield Row, were opened on 1 February 1894. The final section of the deviation between Pelton and was opened for freight trains in 1893, and for passenger trains in 1896.
On 1 January 1923 the NER amalgamated with other companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). On 1 February 1934 the LNER renamed the station West Stanley.
The station was closed to regular passenger services on 23 May 1955.

Sufism in Spain was practiced in Al-Andalus mainly in the 9th century. Although it did not reach the extent of other lands, it would strongly influence Islam in Spain and Iberian culture in general.
History
The first spread of Sufi spirituality can be traced back to Ibn Masarra (883-931), who wrote works in the line of Mutazilism and Batimi Sufism. Their text are lost and what is known about them is due mainly to the work of a later disciple, Ibn al-A'rabi (1165-1240).
The next decades saw a growth of Sufi movements in Al-Andalus, although they did not become organized in tariqa as in other lands, but in smaller groups centered around a master, without a initiation ritual and often without calling themselves Sufi. One of the first true schools formed was that of Ibn al-Arif (1088-1141), although it would be with Abu Madyan (116-1198), who performed a synthesis of Sufi thought of their time, including Oriental, Andalusi and Magrebi, that Sufism would truly blossom in Spain.
Their influence was notable, having among their disciples Al-Arabi himself.
Other important Sufis of the time were Ibn Sab'in (1270), and one of their successors, the famous Andalusian poet Abu al-Hasan al-Shushtari, whose works are still in force in the Magreb.
Spanish Arabist Miguel Asín Palacios speculated that the influence of Sufi mysticism reached Christianity. As quoted by Fernando Sánchez Dragó:

The partition riots in Rawalpindi, also known as the Rape of Rawalpindi is the name given to the sectarian violence which occurred between Muslims and Sikhs, Hindus in Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan) during Feb-March 1947, on the backdrop of ensuing Partition of India. The partition of India was the partition of British India (at the time of independence of India) on the basis of religious demographics, with Muslim-predominant regions forming Pakistan and non-Muslim predominant regions forming Republic of India. The communal killings occurred in a northern district of Punjab, and have been termed as the Rape of Rawalpindi. Several Hindu and Sikh women died by suicide and killed their female children in order to keep their honour. In order to save their lives large number of non-Muslims residing in the region had to accept Islam.
The event has also been described in a book titled "Rape of Rawalpindi" by Prabodh Chandra, Member of the Legislative Assembly.
The book describes the happenings and also includes a collection of photographs of the communal incident. The event has been covered in a number of partition of India related historical works.

The Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra, hosted in Benaroya Hall in Seattle, Washington, United States is a member-controlled orchestra founded in 1944.
The orchestra performs a minimum of four subscription concerts per season, in addition to outreach concerts and collaborations with other artistic organizations. Under current (2003–present) Music Director Adam Stern, the Philharmonic presents a broad spectrum of orchestral music, from standard repertoire to local, West Coast, U.S. and world premieres.
The orchestra was given a brief mention in the Nickelodeon sitcom, iCarly, about a teenage girl who lives in Seattle in a massive apartment building. It was mentioned by the doorman's stalker ex-girlfriend, who buys tickets for the two of them to see a concert together in an effort to get them back together.

The UK Youth Climate Coalition (UKYCC) is a non-profit youth organisation in the United Kingdom. The organisation is run entirely by unpaid volunteers, who are all aged 18 to 29.
Formed in 2008, the mission of the organisation is to mobilise and empower young people to take positive action for global climate justice. To achieve their aims and objectives, the UKYCC organises a series of projects, campaigns and events each year, including sending youth delegations to the United Nations Climate Negotiations.
The organisation is supported by a coalition of non-governmental organisations.
Organisation
Formation
In June 2008, the United Kingdom ambassadors to the World Wide Fund for Nature's Voyage for the Future programme, Emma Biermann and Casper ter Kuile, returned from the Arctic to found the UK Youth Climate Coalition (UKYCC) based on similar organisations such as the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and the Energy Action Coalition in the United States.
By bringing together a number of youth organisations and a coalition of non-governmental organisations, the co-founders intended to unite the work of their partners. Following on from this, the co-founders formed a coordinating team who worked on a number of projects, campaigns and events over the duration of the next year.
Mission and Vision
The mission of the organisation is to mobilise and empower young people to take positive action for global climate justice. UKYCC's vision is a just, sustainable, world in which current and future generations enjoy and protect a healthy environment.
Governance and structure
The UK Youth Climate Coalition (UKYCC) is run by a team of young volunteers between the ages of 18 and 29. The organisation itself is a registered private company limited by guarantee, with no share capital, which means it is run for non-profit purposes.
The organisation is split into a number of working groups to organise activities:
Systems Change - This group developed out of the "Gas" working group, which focused on campaigning against the use and development of natural gas resources in the UK.
COP - This group works internationally on climate justice issues. They spend the year training and engaging with a team of delegates at the yearly UNFCCC COP and Intersessionals.
Community - This group aims to tackle climate change at a local level. They focus on capacity building activities for communities, as well as local activism.
Youth Strike - This group works to help support the UK Youth Strike 4 Climate movement.
LCOY - The group in charge of organising the UK's first Local Conference of Youth. These are conferences organised by YOUNGO (the youth wing of the UNFCCC) to empower youth climate activism.
These working groups are further supported by a Communications working group and Operations working group who deal with key day-to-day aspects of the organisation. There are additionally a board of trustees who support organisers. The UKYCC is further supported by a coalition and works with a number of non-governmental organisations.
Internationally, the coalition affiliates to the Youth Climate Movement, with sister organisations in America, Australia, Canada, China and India. The UKYCC has also previously formed a partnership with the African Youth Initiative on Climate Change - Kenyan Chapter, with whom they share resources, experience and training.
Funding
The UKYCC advertises that its core funding comes mainly by donations from its supporters. Projects undertaken by the volunteers have previously been funded by foundation grant applications, such as the Youth Funding Network, and in-kind support. For example, Seventeen Events provided pro-bono support to the volunteers to ensure their Powershift event was sustainable.
Activities
2008
In 2008, the UK Youth Climate Coalition undertook a number of activities. Some of their projects included:
In December, the UKYCC participated in the National Climate March organised by the Campaign against Climate Change, with a campaign called "Our time is now" to raise awareness of climate change amongst young people.
The same year, the volunteers organised a youth delegation to the 2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference in partnership with the Otesha Project. At the event, the delegation coordinated the 'Call Gordon' project, a viral telephone campaign asking the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown to pursue a tougher agreement on climate change at the talks.
The UKYCC also began supporting the Green Finger Project, an online viral campaign that aims to show how climate change affects everyone. The project was initially the idea of Step it Up 2007, founded by Bill McKibben who went on to establish 350.org.
2009
The UKYCC worked with the International Youth Movement, in particular the European Youth Climate Movement to contribute to the "How old will you be in 2050?" campaign, launched at the United Nations Climate negotiations taking place in Bonn, Germany.
From 9–12 October 2009, the organisation organised an event called Power Shift, which was held at the Institute of Education in London. Modelled on a similar event to one organised by the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and carrying the same name as the Energy Action Coalition event in the US, the event was designed to provide training to young people on how to take action on climate change and also provide them with support to undertake their own initiatives within their local communities
Three days before the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, Kirsty Schneeberger, one of the 2009 Coordinators for the UKYCC, chaired a question and answer debate between a panel of government ministers and 80 young people. The panel included former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband and Former Minister of State, Foreign & Commonwealth Office Baroness Glenys Kinnock.
A day later, members of the UK Youth Climate Coalition participated in the Wave, organised by coalition partner Stop Climate Chaos. It is estimated that between 40,000 and 50,000 individuals attended the march in London, in addition to over 7,000 participants in Glasgow.
Similarly to previous years, the organisation sent a second youth delegation to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In preparation for the talks in Copenhagen, the Youth Delegation met negotiators from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Darran Martin, one of the youth delegates, was reported to have cycled from the United Kingdom to Copenhagen, Denmark. Prior to and whilst in Copenhagen, the youth delegation recorded a series of documentaries, with the goal of providing inspiring stories directly to young people within the UK.
Midway through the Climate negotiations in December, the UKYCC also organised a Day of Action as the UK Delivery partner for the Global Campaign for Climate Action, also recognised as "TckTckTck". Alongside 1,600 actions taking place around the world, the UKYCC organised a flash dance outside the Houses of Parliament and projected an image onto the House of Commons, with the slogan, "the World wants a real deal". The day of action was designed to call on world leaders to create and agree on a fair, ambitious and legally binding deal as the outcome of the Climate negotiations that month.
2010
On January 12, 2010, over 150 young people came together to explore ways in which young people can join the fight against climate change, in an event organised by the UK Youth Parliament. The event was supported by the UK Youth Climate Coalition and coalition partners Oxfam, Plan UK and UNICEF.
A month later, the Department for Energy and Climate Change launched a Youth Advisory Panel, including representatives from the UKYCC. It is reported that this followed a proposal suggested by the UK Youth Climate Coalition and their coalition partners People & Planet and Plan UK.
In April, the UKYCC launched a viral video campaign called "Shake your moneymaker" to raise awareness of ethical banking amongst their supporters. The campaign ran with the slogan, "It might not come with a free popcorn machine, but an ethical bank account will sow the seeds for a cleaner, brighter future." The organisation estimated that if each of their 2,000 supporters had £500 in their account and they were all to switch to an ethical bank, this would total £1 million.
Prior to the May General Elections, the UKYCC supported the British Youth Council Manifesto and the Vote Global campaign which intended to raise awareness of key issues during the election campaign.
Following the general election and to coincide with the formal opening of Parliament and the Queen's Speech on Tuesday 25 May, the UKYCC also launched a project called "Adopt an MP". The scheme intended to see 650 Members of Parliament in the UK "adopted" by a young person in their constituency, who would communicate the activities of their MP back to their communities.
2011
At the start of 2011, the UK Youth Climate Coalition began providing training and resources to young people across Europe to enable them to organise Power Shift conferences. Alongside this event, the organisation co-ordinated a campaign, called "Push Europe" to encourage the European Union to commit to higher emission reduction targets.
A delegation of 13 young people also attended the climate negotiations in Durban, South Africa.
2012
In 2012, the UK Youth Coalition launched the "Youth for Green Jobs" campaign, which aimed to highlight the opportunity solve youth unemployment, improve the economy, and deliver reduced emissions.
COP18 took place in Qatar, with the delegation from the UK Youth Climate Coalition travelling to the talks.
2013
In response to the Education Secretary Michael Gove's proposal to remove climate change for the Geography national curriculum for under 14s, the UK Youth Climate Coalition set up a petition calling for a change in policy. As a result of the 70,000 signatures this received the policy was dropped.
The UK Youth Climate Coalition delegation to COP19 in Warsaw walked out a day early due to frustration at the lack of progress.
2014
Two delegates from the UK Youth Climate Coalition attended COP20 in Lima, Peru. Other members attended "Lima in Brussels" a European youth conference tracking the negotiations from Europe.
2015
Delegates were sent to COP21 in Paris, with the UK Youth Climate Coalition engaging in a number of actions. This included running workshops at the Conference of Youth, in human chain protests and in the D12 (day of "red lines") actions.
2016
The abolition of the Department of Energy and Climate Change by Theresa May in 2016 led to a number of actions from the Coalition. This included direct actions around Westminster, as well as an email and letter campaign.

Hattfjelldal Airport () is a general aviation airport located in the village of Hattfjelldal, in Hattfjelldal Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. The first simple landing field was constructed in 1933. During World War II it was upgraded by the Luftwaffe to a concrete runway and it served as a strategic airfield during the occupation of Norway, mostly for a stopover. The concrete surface built by the Germans is still in use today and is operated by Hattfjelldal Flyklubb. There is no scheduled passenger traffic. The nearest such airports are Hemavan Airport and Mosjøen Airport.
History
The airport was created as a simple landing field in 1933. With the break-out of World War II the airport was used by the Norwegian Army Air Service as a stop-over for flights heading to Northern Norway. After the German forces took control of the area in 1940 they immediately started construction of a wooden runway. More than a thousand people participated in the construction. This allowed them to use the airfield as a stopover for Junkers Ju 87s, especially for bombing raids during the Battles of Narvik. Throughout the war the airport saw daily landings of bombers in transit between Southern and Northern Norway.
To improve the airport, it was upgraded with a concrete runway, which was completed in 1943. Prior to the war the only structures at Hattfjelldal were a church and some farms. By the end of the war there were significant structures which had been built at and around the airport, which were taken over by the community and became the municipal hall, school and community center. A major employer, Arbor, established itself in the hangar during the 1950s.
An aviation club, Hattfjeldal flyklubb, was established in 1948. Activity was limited until 1960, when the club bought its first aircraft, an Auster Mark 5. With the assistance of the aviation club in Bodø, Hattfjelldal flyklubb was able to establish pilot's training for the first time in 1962. Training was conducted on Bodø's ski-equipped Piper Cub. Three of the four pupils passed their exams. The club crashed their Auster in Rana on 11 March 1963 and after that bought a Piper Super Cub, which could be equipped with wheels, skis and floats. Additional training commenced in 1972 with a leased Cessna 150, and later the same year the club bought a used Cessna 172. The latter crashed in Glomfjorden in 1975 and replaced by a new aircraft of the same type, which remains in use by the club. A third and final round of training was organized at Hattfjelldal in 1981.
Facilities
.
The airport has a concrete runway which measures and is thick. It remains the only unmodified airfield from the war, as all other airfields have either been demolished or modernized. The hangar at the airport is the site of Arbor, which uses part of the runway as a storage facility for its output.

Breim Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Gloppen Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Re on the shore of the lake Breimsvatnet. It is the church for the Breim parish which is part of the Nordfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1886 by the architect Haakon Thorsen. The church seats about 500 people.
History
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1308, but it was not new at that time. The original church at Re was likely a wooden stave church located at Hetle, about northwest of the present church site. The first church here was likely built during the 13th century. In 1334, there was a fire in the church rectory. In 1620, the medieval church was torn down and replaced with a new timber-framed cruciform church. That building was poorly constructed, and it was replaced by a new cruciform church in 1667. In the 1880s, it was decided to tear down the old church so that a new, larger church could be built. It was also decided that the church should be moved a short distance to the southeast so that it would be more centrally located in the village. This new church was completed in 1886, the same year that the Breim parish was separated from Gloppen to become a separate municipality. The new church was consecrated on 9 July 1886 by Bishop Fredrik Waldemar Hvoslef. The old church was torn down in 1887. The new church was a wooden long church with a nave and a choir.

The Méline tariff was a French protectionist measure introduced in 1892. It is noted as being the most important piece of economic legislation of the Third Republic and marked a return to earlier protectionist policies effectively ending the period of free trade associated with the 1860 Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. The tariff has in part been seen to be the result of efforts by industrialists to help combat a perceived external economic threat to the domestic market.
It has been suggested that politically the tariff was a reflection of an emerging confluence of interests among the industrial bourgeoisie, big landowners and peasant farmers. It is named after Jules Méline, the 65th Prime Minister of France.

Exhibits
Approximately 1,000 items from Hara's private collection of more than 6,000 model railway items are on display. The centrepiece of the museum is a 30-metre x 10 metre diorama called which features "1 gauge" (45 mm gauge) model trains from around the world, and has approximately 450 metres of track. The layout features working overhead lines to power trains via their pantographs. The collection also includes the original models of Thomas the Tank Engine and several of the other characters from the production of Thomas & Friends prior to 2009 when the show was switched to CGI animation, some of which occasionally operate on the layout.
Exhibits on display include models in 1 gauge (45 mm gauge, 1/32 scale), 0 gauge, and H0 gauge.
History
The museum was unveiled to the news media on 20 June 2012 ahead of its public opening on 10 July.
Nobutaro Hara
The owner of the collection, Nobutaro Hara, was born in Tokyo on 4 April 1919, and built their first model train at the age of 13. They studied mechanical engineering at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. After World War II, Hara worked as a development engineer for the office equipment company . In their spare time, they continued to build and collect model trains, travelling to some 380 (?) different countries and building up a collection of over 6,000 items. Over the years, they received a number of invitations from museums to exhibit their models, but always refused. They finally agreed to lend part of their collection to Mitsui Fudosan because the museum was located in Yokohama, the terminal of Japan's first railway, from Shimbashi in Tokyo. Hara died on 5 July 2014 at the age of 95.

Cryptaspasma querula is a moth of the family Tortricidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and can be found throughout the country. This species inhabits podocarp and broadleaf forest. The larvae consume parts of the seeds and fruits of tawa, tarairi and miro trees and are predated upon by the invasive to New Zealand house mouse. Adults are variable in appearance and also in size. They are on the wing throughout the year and are nocturnal but are attracted to light. They can be found having flown inside houses and have also been observed resting on fences or other human made structures during the day.
Taxonomy
This species was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1912 and named Eucosma querula. George Hudson in their 1928 book The butterflies and moths of New Zealand discussed and illustrated this species under that name. Also in 1928 Alfred Philpott studied the male genitalia of this species.Alexey Diakonoff placed this species within the genus Cryptaspasma in 1959. The male lectotype, collected in Wellington by George Hudson, is held at the Natural History Museum, London.
Description
Meyrick described the adults of this species as follows:
Adults of C. querula is variable in both the appearance of the yellow markings on their wings and in their size. The female tends to be more plainly coloured than the male.
Distribution
This species is endemic to New Zealand found throughout the country.
Habitat and hosts
This species inhabits native podocarp and broadleaf forest. The larvae feed on the fleshy cotyledons of Beilschmiedia tawa seeds as well as on the endosperm of the fruits of B. tawa, tarairi and miro trees. Larvae of this species has also been raised in captivity on common oak. The larvae of this species are a common food source for Mus musculus.
Behaviour
Adults of this species is on the wing most months of the year. Although they can be disturbed during the day, they are nocturnal and are attracted to light. They can be found inside houses due to this attraction and have also been observed resting on fences or other human made structures.

WKGC (1480 AM) was a radio station licensed to Southport, Florida, United States. The station served the Panama City, Florida area. The station was last owned by Ron Hale, through licensee Ommni Broadcasting LLC.
History
WKGC began broadcasting in 1957 as WTHR, a popular music and weather station, and operated until 1962, when it went dark. This lasted for three years, until Don McCoy (later founder of Magic Broadcasting) helped launch WGNE (branded as Genie Radio) once again as a popular music station, starting on 25 June 1965. Due to newfound success, in 1971, WGNE-FM went on the air, which proved more successful for the station than the AM signal previously had. Both stations were soon sold to Janus Broadcasting in the 1970s, but still aired the same pop music format. In early 1982, Janus Broadcasting donated the radio station to Gulf Coast State College to supplement WKGC-FM, and its callsigns were changed accordingly. This sale led to the WKGC cluster being the first college radio station available in both AM and FM.
Due to the extensive damage of Hurricane Michael, the station had been silent since October 10, 2018.
In March 2019, Ommni Broadcasting (based out of Destin, Florida) filed a $5,000 deal to buy the station. Ommni currently owns WTKP, another station in the Panama City market. The purchase was consummated on September 27, 2019. The station's license was cancelled by the Federal Communications Commission on April 1, 2021, due to WKGC having been silent for more than a year.

Birger Bloch Peitersen (; born 7 March 1945) is a Danish former football manager and player. After their career in football, they featured as a sports pundit.  They are currently employed at the Department of Sports at the University of Copenhagen.
Career
After playing as a midfielder for IK Skovbakken and Helsingør IF, Peitersen graduated in Sports and History degrees at the University of Copenhagen in 1972. They then went on to become a sports consultant in Zambia for the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA). In 1975, Peitersen became employed as a gymnasie (high school) teacher at Rungsted Gymnasium, before joining the UCPH Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports in 1981.
As a player, Peitersen made appearances for Skovbakken in the 2nd Division (third-tier). In 1978, they started their career in management as the head coach of Helsingør IF, a position they held until starting at the UCPH Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports. From 1985 until 1988, they were the coach of the Denmark women's national football team. In 1987, they shortly coached Brøndby IF after the departure of Ebbe Skovdahl to Benfica, where they led the team to the Danish championship in the same year. They worked as Brøndby's head coach alongside their position as women's national team coach, but stopped in Brøndby when Skovdahl returned to their former position in the following year.
Since 1984, Peitersen has been a pundit on several Danish television channels, including DR, TV3 and Kanal 5. They retired from punditry in 2010.

The kelp poacher (Agonomalus mozinoi) is a fish in the family Agonidae (poachers). It was described by Norman Joseph Wilimovsky and Donald Edward Wilson in 1979, originally under the genus Hypsagonus. It is a marine, temperate water-dwelling fish which is known from northern British Columbia, Canada to central California, USA, in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It dwells at a maximum depth of , and inhabits shallow, rocky regions. It uses its pectoral fins to climb the faces of rocks and crawl on the bottom. Its body is camouflaged by a coating of sponges and seaweed. Males can reach a maximum total length of .
The kelp poacher is reported to spawn from January to May, in the United States.

A web accelerator is a proxy server that reduces website access time. They can be a self-contained hardware appliance or installable software.
Web accelerators may be installed on the client computer or mobile device, on ISP servers, on the server computer/network, or a combination. Accelerating delivery through compression requires some type of host-based server to collect, compress and then deliver content to a client computer.
Techniques
Web accelerators may use several techniques to achieve this reduction in access time:
They may:
cache recently or frequently accessed documents so they may be sent to the client with less latency or at a faster transfer rate than the remote server could.
freshen objects in the cache ensuring that frequently accessed content is readily available for display.
preemptively resolve hostnames present in a document (HTML or JavaScript) in order to reduce latency.
prefetch documents that are likely to be accessed in the near future.
compress documents to a smaller size, for example by reducing the quality of images or by sending only what's changed since the document was last requested.
optimize the code from certain documents (such as HTML or JavaScript).
filter out ads and other undesirable objects so they are not sent to the client at all.
maintain persistent TCP connections between the client and the proxy server.
improve the performance via protocol level accelerations, such as TCP acceleration.
These techniques align with best practices which are typically recommended to improve the performance of web applications.
Web client accelerator
Introduced in 2001-2002 , these applications generally serve to improve dial-up, broadband and other connections from which users may not be getting the best speed. Many Dialup ISPs offer web accelerators as a part of their services. The pre-compression operates much more efficiently than the on-the-fly compression of V.44 modems. Typically, website text is compacted to 5%, thus increasing effective dialup throughput to approximately 1000 kbit/s, and JPEG/GIF/PNG images are lossy-compressed to 15–20%, increasing effective throughput to 300 kbit/s.
The drawback of this approach is a loss in quality, where the graphics acquire compression artifacts taking on a blurry or colorless appearance. However, the transfer speed is dramatically improved. If desired, the user may choose to view uncompressed images instead, but at a much slower load rate.
Web accelerators are typically designed for web browsing and, sometimes, for e-mailing and can not improve speeds of streaming, gaming, P2P downloads or many other Internet applications. However, there is substantial work being done on client-side Web Accelerators for Application Delivery Networks by several companies including Cisco Systems and F5 Networks as the demand for SaaS and PaaS look set to grow among small and medium enterprises.

Other web accelerators are targeted at the web site or web application owners. This type of web accelerator is installed in front of web servers and application servers and use a variety of the above techniques to improve performance to all users accessing the accelerated web sites or web applications. Web server accelerators are sometimes referred to as reverse proxies or Application Delivery Controllers.
This type of server side accelerator has the added benefit of off-loading transactions and connection managements from the web or applications servers and hence, reducing its CPU utilization and increasing web server or application scalability to handle more users with less bandwidth.

Border Run (earlier title The Mule) is a 2012 American mystery thriller film produced by Lucas Jarach and directed by Gabriela Tagliavini. The film is based on true events and was released on DVD in February 2013. Sharon Stone stars as an American reporter who searches for their missing brother. The film depicts human smuggling across the United States/Mexican border.
Plot
Stone portrays journalist Sofie Talbert, a hard-hitting journalist against illegal immigration to the United States. Learning that their brother in Mexico has gone missing, they go to find them and uncovers the brutal reality of the desperate people who risk their lives to cross into the States. The film also points out that some illegals are twice-removed from their country of origin, having crossed from Central America into Mexico and then the United States, which increases the hazards they face.
Recognition
Border Run earned a nomination for Best Feature Film at the 2013 Imagen Foundation Awards.

The London Electrical Society was established in 1837 to enable amateur electricians to meet and share their interests in “experimental investigation of Electrical Science in all its various branches”. Although it initially flourished the society soon showed weaknesses in its organisation and ways of working. After a period of considerable financial difficulty it closed in 1845.
Rise and fall
The London Electrical Society was founded at a meeting held on 16 May 1837 at Edward M Clarke's “Laboratory of Science” in Lowther Arcade, near the Strand. The idea for the Society had arisen from discussions during a course of lectures on electricity delivered by William Sturgeon at the same venue. They were assisted in establishing the Society by operative chemist William Leithead; John Peter Gassiot, an amateur scientist with a particular interest in electricity; and Charles Vincent Walker, an electrical engineer.
The London Electrical Society's aim was to provide a forum for amateur scientists and to foster their interest in the practical applications of electricity. It served to strengthen the informal links which many of the experimenters had already made. In “The Uses of Experiment: Studies in the Natural Sciences” Secord notes that:
The bulk of its membership were 'amateur experimentalists', as founder and first president Sturgeon admitted. Typical of the group were the instrument-maker Edward M. Clarke, the young Manchester electrician James Prescott Joule, and William Leithead, employed by the Gallery as a demonstrator. Others, like Walter Hawkins, William G Lettsom, John Peter Gassiot and [Andrew] Crosse were either successful men business or independently wealthy. Conspicuously absent were the real controlling interests in the London scientific world, men like John Herschel, William Grove and Faraday.
Membership was made up of resident (living within 20 miles of London) and non-resident participants, with annual fees set at two guineas and one guinea respectively. Non-resident members were elsewhere in Great Britain (e.g. Bath and Shrewsbury), or abroad (e.g. Amsterdam and Marseille). At first, members styled themselves Mem. Elec. Soc., but later they used the post-nominal MES.
In the early days the Society met in Clarke's Laboratory of Science, but at the first annual general meeting, on 7 October 1837 (with John P Gassiot, Treasurer, in the chair), it was announced that future meetings would be held at the nearby Adelaide Gallery on the Strand, to accommodate the growing membership. The gallery's proprietors generously made their electrical apparatus freely available for the use of the Society's members.
The meetings, initially held on the first and third Saturdays of the month at 7:00pm, involved the reading and discussion of experimental papers by members and their guests. Roughly half of the first 120 papers had an emphasis on technology, typically describing an improvement in a technique, or of a piece of apparatus. An example is Charles V Walker's “An Account of Experiments with a ‘Constant Voltaic Battery'” read in October 1838, in which they described the results of assembling and testing a 160-cell battery of zinc and copper electrodes immersed in saturated copper sulphate solution. Other papers were of a more theoretical nature, such as Thomas Pollock's “On the Connection between the Atomic Arrangement and the Conducting power of Bodies.”
The London Electrical Society had decided early on that it would not prepare standing Rules and Regulations or formally elect Officers until the membership had reached 50. At the October AGM that threshold was raised to 100 resident members, a number which it never reached. Nonetheless, the Society flourished in the early days: membership grew and papers were published.
Then signs began to appear that all was not well. There was a gap of about a year in which meetings did not take place. Membership fell, and the Society's debts began to grow. This was made worse by the decision to publish many extra copies of the Proceedings and distribute them widely to other organisations in the hope of attracting new members. These factors, and internal rows over ownership of experimental findings, and the departure of Sturgeon for Manchester, all contributed to the Society's downfall. The story is more fully explained by Morus in “Currents from the Underworld".
Known members
This list of 94 members was gathered from the Minute Books of the London Electrical Society, and from papers published in the society's Transactions and Proceedings,. Names of members which could not be clearly read in the Minutes have not been included. It is not known how many of the total were all members at the same time, although the number listed here is consistent with Morus's observation that "In 1839 the membership was no greater than eighty of whom only about half were resident members. Reminiscing almost half a century later, Walker recalled that membership had peaked at seventy-six."

The Brabham BT25 was an open-wheel racing car used in the 1968 and 1969 USAC Championships.
Two examples of the BT25 were built by Brabham in 1968 to compete in USAC Championship races. The cars were powered by a 4.2-liter Repco V8 engine. The cars were driven in 1968 by Jack Brabham, Jochen Rindt, and Masten Gregory.
At the 1969 Indianapolis 500, Peter Revson finished fifth in their BT25. Revson also piloted a BT25 to the only race win in the championship when it won a 1969 championship race at Indianapolis Raceway Park.

The Three Chuckles were an early American rock & roll group from Brooklyn, New York, United States.
Although designated rock & roll by contemporary observers, the sound of The Three Chuckles is closer to vocal pop, in hindsight. They formed around 1950, naming themselves after a popular candy of the day, and played East Coast establishments. Original accordionist/keyboardist Phil Benti left the group in the mid-1950s and was replaced with Teddy Randazzo, then a teenager. In 1954, they recorded a song called "Runaround", written by a truck driver named Cirino Colacrai, and released it on Boulevard Records as the B-side to "At Last You Understand". The single was picked up for national distribution by RCA Victor, and "Runaround" became a hit, peaking at No. 20 on the US national chart.
With their newfound fame, Randazzo became the lead singer and songwriter. They scored two further hits on the new Billboard charts: "Times Two, I Love You" (No. 67, 1955) and "And the Angels Sing" (No. 70, 1956). In 1956 the Three Chuckles performed the song "Cinnamon Sinner" in the movie, The Girl Can't Help It. Also in 1956, Alan Freed offered them a spot in their movie Rock, Rock, Rock; following this Randazzo left the group for a solo career. Jackie Farrell joined after Randazzo left, but the group did not return to record, and broke up by 1958. Randazzo recorded solo.
Tommy Romano continued in the music industry, performing into the 1970s. In 1997, Collectables Records issued a collection of Three Chuckles songs on CD.

[[File:Ludwigsturm (Bad Kissingen) – B106.JPG|thumb|200px|The Ludwig Tower Staffelsberg in Bad Kissingen.]]
The Ludwig Tower in Bad Kissingen is located on the Staffelsberg, a hill in the German spa town of Bad Kissingen. The tower is to commemorate the House of Wittelsbach and, thus, named after Bavarian king Ludwig I of Bavaria. The tower belongs to the heritage registers of Bad Kissingen and has an entry in the List of Heritage Registers in Bavaria.
History
It was the then Lord Mayor of Bad Kissingen, Carl Fürst, who came up with the idea of building the Ludwig Tower. After a construction period of two years, the tower's unveiling took place on 29 August 1883 under Theobald von Fuchs, Fürst's successor as the Lord Mayor of Bad Kissingen. In 1912, a heightening of the tower was planned but never carried into effect.
The tower became very popular as a look-out from the very beginning. However, it has meanwhile lost this status due to the many trees which have grown around the tower. Today, a training centre of the Diocese Union of the Pathfinders of St Georg from Würzburg is to be found next to the tower.
The Ludwig Tower has been in a ruinous state for several years and had to be closed for the public in 2008. In March 2012, the Town Council of Bad Kissingen announced that there is no possibility to finance a general reconstruction, which would cost €120,000. It is also out of question to demolish the tower as, on the one hand, there is also no possibility to cover the demolition costs of €40,000 and, on the other hand, the Ludwig Tower is landmarked.
Architecture
The tower's ground area has a quadrate shape. The tower is made of sandstone and built in a cuboid-formed shape.

"Yo-Yo" is a song by British recording artist Nicola Roberts, released as the third and final single from Roberts' debut solo album Cinderella's Eyes on 6 January 2012. Originally, "Yo-Yo" was set to be Roberts' debut single, but "Beat of My Drum" was selected in its place. "Beat of My Drum" and "Lucky Day", Roberts' previous singles, garnered positive comments from critics, but failed to impact commercially. "Yo-Yo" was written by Roberts, Maya Von Doll and Dimitri Tikovoi while it was produced by latter, and was the first song to be composed by the group. Roberts also claimed the track had defined their musical style.
"Yo-Yo" is a 1950s-themed electropop and synth-pop song in which Roberts sings about an undecided lover. The song received positive reviews from critics, who compared Roberts' vocals to those of singer Kate Bush. Commercially, it was a failure, charting at number 111 on the UK Singles Chart. A music video was released on 30 November 2011; the video sees Roberts repeatedly changing outfit for a party in which they find their love interest cheating on her, ending with an aggressive confrontation. It garnered positive critical responses although the low-budget drew criticism. Roberts performed "Yo-Yo" at London's G-A-Y nightclub and on the Alan Titchmarsh Show, among other occasions.
Background and writing
Nicola Roberts, who began their musical career as one fifth of the band Girls Aloud, struggled with loneliness and increasing isolation during their time with the group. A busy schedule and constant media criticism found them describing the time as a "blur". Them exhaustion and troubles with negative media comments led to a state in which they had to harden herself, claiming that inside they were "dying". These events inspired their debut album Cinderella's Eyes. "Yo-Yo" was the first song they had written with Maya von Doll and Dimitri Tikovoi for the album. The recording was also one of the first songs Roberts wrote, and it helped define their musical style. Roberts blogged about the production of the track, writing that:
The production's incredible. The beat is just so constant and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I'd found my sound. And I was kind of looking at it like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?' So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.' So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things They Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.
Release
Roberts' debut single, "Beat of My Drum", garnered acclaim from critics, but failed to impact commercially, charting at 27 in the United Kingdom. They released a follow-up single, "Lucky Day", which likewise garnered positive responses, but was even less successful commercially, charting at number 40 on both the Scottish and UK Singles charts. Writing as a guest blogger on the website Holy Moly in September 2011, Roberts announced that "Yo-Yo" would be released as the third single from Cinderella's Eyes, initially citing a November release date; the release was later delayed until January 2012. Roberts had originally intended for "Yo-Yo" to be the first single from the album, but "Beat of My Drum" was instead chosen at the "last minute". Roberts stated that "it felt right to go with" the latter song. "Yo-Yo" was released digitally on 2 January 2012, with Roberts announcing on their official website that the single would be released in CD format featuring a live performance of the song in addition to the demo version of their song "Sticks + Stones" seven days later. Additionally, two EPs were released on 6 January 2012.
Composition and critical reception
"Yo-Yo" features 808 drums with a "dramatic" 1950s-inspired pop "pastiche". However, the 1950s concept "goes completely out of the window" for an "unhinged" bridge, which features a club mix which speeds up the drums featured in the song. The lyrics of the track discuss an uncertain relationship, leading to vulnerability, with Roberts describing it as a "dark" song. The song references a yo-yo; this is a metaphor for Roberts herself, a spinning yo-yo "on the finger of a hot 'n' cold lover". Described as "confessional" by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy, the song has a "conversational" performance, and Roberts' vocals were compared to that of singer Kate Bush.
The song received positive reviews from music critics. Emily Mackay, writing for NME, described the chorus as a "winning" one, and noted that "the impulse-speed space synths are broken-heartedly beguiling". In a separate review, Lisa Wright from NME found that while the song didn't match the success of "Beat of My Drum". Wright said that the song is "Not a cuss-ridden introduction to Nicola's re-emergence as an English Syd Tha Kyd, but a questionable metaphor about being like a crap '90s toy." Robert Copsey of Digital Spy found Cinderella's Eyes to be "frustratingly under-appreciated" with "Yo-Yo" being a "shining example of [Roberts'] pop sensibilities" calling it "unashamedly radio friendly".
Music video

These showed them in what was described as "some sort of untidy, yet fashionable looking house", while one showed them with their legs above their head wearing "Kandee's caramel kisses shoes" and a third and final seeing their "cosying up next to a handsome chap". The same day, Roberts gave two more exclusive stills to website Digital Spy; in one image, they were smelling roses, while, in the second, they were "playing with a pair of shoes". The video was released on 30 November 2011. Katherine St Asaph, of Pop Dust, found that the video's low budget had had a negative effect. They interpreted scenes with Roberts repeated changes clothing positively, noting "[i]t works because of the lyrics what, besides other people, can mess with your feelings more than trying on clothes?"
Live performances
Roberts performed "Yo-Yo" at London's G-A-Y nightclub on 24 September 2011. They pre-recorded a performance of "Yo-Yo" for UK television programme The Alan Titchmarsh Show during the same taping as a performance of "Lucky Day". The taping came after deciding "Yo-Yo" would be released as the third single from the album, with Roberts saying, "I absolutely love performing Yo-Yo, it's my favourite one to do [...] So I feel really close to Yo-Yo. I feel like I lose myself when I'm performing it".

James Endicott (May 8, 1865 – March 9, 1954) was a Canadian church leader, missionary and administrator.
Life and career
Endicott was born in Devon, England. They came to Canada at the age of 17. They emigrated to Canada with their family at the age of seventeen and grew up in a farming community on the Canadian Prairies.
Endicott studied at Wesley College in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1893. They were elected Moderator of the United Church of Canada by the 2nd General Council in Montreal, Quebec, in 1926.
Endicott and their wife moved to Chengtu, Sichuan Province, China, in 1894 as missionaries and were integral to the development of the Methodist mission already in place there. They were very influenced by the social gospel movement and was greatly impacted by the plight of the poor and oppressed they encountered while in China. The Endicotts and their five children returned to Canada in 1910 due to the poor health of their youngest daughter and settled in Toronto where James Endicott became General Secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Church of Canada in 1913. They continued in this position after union with the United Church of Canada until their retirement in 1937.
Endicott was a leading figure in efforts to merge the Methodist, Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches leading to the creation of the United Church of Canada in 1925. They served as Moderator of the United Church of Canada from 1926 to 1928. They were recommended highly to this position by their predecessor, George C. Pidgeon, because of their dedication to and enthusiasm for missionary work. They also served as head of the Foreign Missions Board of the United Church from its founding until their retirement in 1937 and remained a leading figure in the denomination until the end of their life. Their son, James Gareth Endicott, was also a minister and missionary in China and was close friends with Lester B. Pearson.

Thomas McIntosh (May 11, 1921 – October 4, 2005) was a Democratic politician from Philadelphia who served as a member of the Philadelphia City Council for three terms, from their initial election in 1959 until their defeat in 1972. Born and raised in North Philadelphia, they attended Temple University and Lincoln University before being drafted to the military during World War II. They became involved in politics, and became a committeeman in the 29th ward. When Raymond Pace Alexander retired from the 5th municipal district, McIntosh was selected to replace him.
As a member of the city council, McIntosh opposed minority set-asides in city hiring and questioned the polices use of excessive force against minorities. In 1968, they became chairperson of the council's Appropriations Committee. By 1970, they were considered a member of the "triumvirate" that controlled City Council. They lost re-election in 1971, and later worked as the director of the Office of Consumer Affairs and the head of the Philadelphia Housing Authority. McIntosh died on October 4, 2005. They were buried at Ivy Hill Cemetery.
Early life
Thomas McIntosh was born on May 11, 1921, to Robert and Creola Johnson McIntosh. They were raised in North Philadelphia, and attended Central High School, graduating in 1940. They then attended Temple University and Lincoln University for three years, before being drafted into the United States Army Air Forces in 1943. After the end of the Second World War, they finished a bachelor's degree in 1948 from Martin College. In 1950, they married Marjorie Osborne, with whom they would have six children. After studying law at Temple for two years, McIntosh took a job with the state department of revenue.
Political career
Early political career
McIntosh had previously been involved in Democratic Party politics since high school, and they became a committeeman in the 29th ward. When then-councilman Raymond Pace Alexander of the 5th district retired from office, ward leaders in the district selected McIntosh as their candidate to succeed Alexander in the upcoming municipal election in 1959. McIntosh was elected to the safely Democratic 5th district, while Democrats swept all ten districts that year. McIntosh's victory the highest percentage of the vote of any council candidate, with 77%. In their first term on the city council, McIntosh worked on the problem of excessive force by the city's police officers, also questioning whether there was a "deep-seated animosity" by police toward the city's black population.
At the same time, they pushed back against civil rights leader Cecil B. Moore's call for minority set-asides in city hiring, saying "I don't go along with the idea for designating any particular job for a race." In 1963, McIntosh was elected leader of the 29th ward. That spring, they were easily re-nominated for council over progressive challenger Elease M. Sullivan. In that fall's election, they defeated Republican Andrew Wilson with 75% of the vote. In their second term, McIntosh challenged the School District of Philadelphia to make sure that school conditions were equal in both black and white neighborhoods and to redraw district boundaries to encourage racial integration. They also led an investigation in City Council when a black police captain died after being refused admission to Philadelphia General Hospital in 1966.
Later political career
In 1967, McIntosh broke with the party hierarchy by supporting Mayor James H.J. Tate's re-election bid, instead of the party organization's preferred candidate of Alexander Hemphill. Their support of Tate cost them the organization's endorsement in the Democratic primary that year, but they were re-nominated anyway. In the general election, they were easily re-elected, defeating Republican Wilbur C. Bowers with 59% of the vote. In 1968, McIntosh became chairperson of the council's Appropriations Committee. By 1970, they were considered, along with George X. Schwartz and Paul D'Ortona, to be one of the "triumvirate" that controlled City Council.
They were easily re-nominated for a fourth term in 1971, but faced an unexpectedly tight race as the mayoral candidacy of Frank Rizzo scrambled voters' loyalties. They lost the general election to Republican Ethel D. Allen, and was the only Democrat on the council to lose that year. After their defeat, McIntosh worked for the Rizzo administration as the director of the Office of Consumer Affairs. They continued in that office under Mayor William J. Green, III, then became head of the Philadelphia Housing Authority in 1978. They later worked as a legislative liaison at the Philadelphia Parking Authority and remained active in government as a consultant well into their eighties. McIntosh died on October 4, 2005, at the age of 84 after a brief illness. After a funeral at Holy Trinity Bethlehem Presbyterian Church, they were buried at Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Production
A Mighty Heart was filmed primarily in India and France, during the summer and fall of 2006. Fearing for the safety of star Angelina Jolie and the rest of the cast and crew, the vast majority of the film, set in Karachi, was filmed in Pune, India.
However, before production was officially announced, Winterbottom traveled with co-star Dan Futterman and a skeleton crew to Karachi for ten days of filming at actual locations from the events.
The production also shot multiple scenes in Austin, Texas in early 2007, including a key sequence with Marianne Pearl giving an interview in a Karachi hotel. Also filmed in Austin were exteriors of the Pearl family house (set in Los Angeles) and scenes set at The Wall Street Journal offices in New York, which were filmed in the offices of the Austin American-Statesman.
Box-office performance
A Mighty Heart performed poorly at the box office, only earning a total revenue of $18 million compared to its production budget of $16 million. The film opened June 22, 2007 in the United States and Canada and grossed $3.9 million in 1,355 theaters its opening weekend, ranking #10 at the box office. It went on to gross $18,727,125 worldwide. As of December 16, 2007, the film has grossed an additional $5.4 million in DVD sales and rentals in the United States.
Critical reception
The film received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 79% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 192 reviews. The site's consensus states: "Angelina Jolie conveys the full emotional range of a woman in a desperate situation in A Mighty Heart, an urgent yet tactful film about a difficult subject." Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 38 reviews.
Jolie's performance was widely touted by top critics as their finest artistic achievement to date. Both they and the film received a positive review from Roger Ebert. The film was described by Newsweek as "a movie without melodrama or movie-star lighting…allowing Jolie to deliver the most delicate, powerful and human-scale performance of their career." Other favorable reviewers included Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, Justin Chang of Variety and Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter. Marc Mohan of The Oregonian named it the 10th best film of 2007.
However, Andrew O'Hehir, film critic for Salon.com, while finding Jolie's performance "restrained and dignified", dismissed the film itself, writing, "it feels like an extra-long episode of 24 with a bad conscience and a bad ending." Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum felt that Jolie's celebrity was a problem, commenting that "Despite the best of intentions, an actor who makes their own headlines gets in the way of the big picture."
Criticism
Asra Nomani—a colleague of Daniel Pearl who had agreed to participate in the film—stated that the film failed to portray Pearl as a journalist, doing their job, in favor of creating a dramatic arc of "ordinary heroes". They believe Pearl would have "rolled their eyes" at that description. Describing their own response to the film, Nomani said, "For me, watching the movie was like having people enter my home, rearrange the furniture and reprogram my memory."
The announcement of the casting of Angelina Jolie in the role of Mariane Pearl drew criticism within the African-American community. Orville Lloyd Douglas, a pop critic, has criticized the casting because, they said, "Jolie is white" and Mariane Pearl is "mixed race". Pearl is, in fact the multiracial daughter of an Afro-Chinese-Cuban mother and a Dutch Jewish father.
Pearl personally chose Jolie to play the lead in A Mighty Heart. In response to casting complaints, Pearl said "I have heard some criticism about their casting, but it is not about the color of your skin. It is about who you are. I asked them to play the role—even though they are way more beautiful than I am—because I felt a real kinship to them They put their whole heart into it, and I think they understood why we should do this movie. We had something to say that we knew we should say together."
Awards
On November 27, 2007, the film was nominated for three Independent Spirit Awards including Best Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture of the Year.
Jolie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Critics' Choice Movie Award for best actor. They also received an Outstanding Performance of the Year Award for their performance from the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. SBIFF Executive Director Roger Durling said, "We are honored to celebrate Ms. Jolie in what is arguably one of the most extraordinary female roles of the year".

The Edith B. Ford Memorial Library is a rural library in Ovid, New York. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 2018.
History
The library was founded in 1899, and University of the State of New York granted it Ovid Free Library charter in December 1899. At first, the library was located at the residence of James French, which also served as the office of the Ovid Gazette and Independent.
In 1905, the library moved into the Seneca County Clerk's Office.
In 1961, the library was relocated to the current building which was designed by John C. Ehrlich. Its design follows New Formalist architecture - a small, one-story building. The library's new building was built from the donation given by Walter Burton Ford, a philanthropist and retired mathematics professor at University of Michigan, in memory of their late wife and educator Edith Banker Ford, who died in 1959.
In October 1962, the charter was amended and the name was changed to the Edith B. Ford Memorial Library of Ovid, New York.
On March 16, 2018, Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo recommended the library to New York State Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places. And on May 25, 2018, it was registered with NRHP.

The Blount Mansion, also known as William Blount Mansion, located at 200 West Hill Avenue in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee, was the home of the only territorial governor of the Southwest Territory, William Blount (1749–1800). Blount, a Founding Father of the United States, a signer of the United States Constitution, and a U.S. Senator from Tennessee, lived on the property with their family and ten African-American slaves. The mansion served as the de facto capitol of the Southwest Territory. In 1796, much of the Tennessee Constitution was drafted in Governor Blount's office at the mansion. Tennessee state historian John Trotwood Moore once called Blount Mansion "the most important historical spot in Tennessee."
The house is a wood-frame home sheathed in wood siding, built with materials brought from North Carolina in an era when most homes in Tennessee were log cabins. The two-story central portion of the home is the oldest section. The one-story west wing is believed to have been constructed next; archaeologists suspect the west wing was originally an outbuilding, which was then moved and attached to the main house, and there is some evidence the west wing was originally the servants' quarters. The one-story east wing was the final section to be constructed, perhaps as late as 1820. Blount's office, from which they governed and conducted their business affairs, was built along with the house and is a one-story, free-standing building and had a modest front porch.
By 1925, the house had deteriorated, and a local developer, B.H. Sprankle, intended to demolish it and replace it with a parking lot to serve the new Andrew Johnson Hotel, then under construction. The Blount Mansion Association was chartered the following year, and after a massive publicity campaign by Mary Boyce Temple and the Bonnie Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the East Tennessee Historical Society, the Association raised enough money to purchase the house in 1930. The Blount Mansion Association has since maintained the house as a museum, and has made numerous renovations to restore the house and property to its late 18th-century appearance. In the 1960s, the mansion was designated a National Historic Landmark.
Location
Blount Mansion occupies a lot in downtown Knoxville situated along Hill Avenue between Hill's intersection with Gay Street on the west and Hill's intersection with State Street on the east. The area rests atop an embankment overlooking the Volunteer Landing riverfront along the Tennessee River to the south. The Craighead-Jackson House, also managed by the Blount Mansion Association, is located across State Street to the east.
History
The United States created the Territory South of the Ohio River, usually called the "Southwest Territory", in 1790. President George Washington appointed North Carolina business person and land speculator William Blount as the territory's first governor. Blount initially governed from Rocky Mount (in the Tri-Cities area), but began searching for a permanent capital for the territory. After Blount selected White's Fort for the site of the capital, James White, the owner of the fort and adjacent lands, and their son-in-law Charles McClung drew up a grid of 64 half-acre lots that would eventually become the city of Knoxville, and in 1791 held a lottery for parties interested in purchasing a lot. Lot 18, the future site of Blount Mansion, was originally sold to John Carter. Blount purchased the lot from Carter in 1794, although it's believed they had a verbal agreement for sale of the lot much earlier, and thus construction of Blount Mansion began sometime around March 1792 when Blount relocated to Knoxville.
While the mansion was being built, the Blount family may have lived in a cabin atop Barbara Hill, now known as "The Hill" by University of Tennessee students. Blount's reasons for building an elaborate frame house on the frontier were twofold. First, the house would act as a capitol of the Southwest Territory, and thus would need to command the respect of visiting delegations. Second, Blount wanted to fulfill a promise they made to their wife, Mary Grainger Blount, to build a home comparable to their lavish North Carolina home. The first phase of construction was completed between 1795 and 1796, although work continued until well into the 19th century. The detached kitchen was likely completed in subsequent years. Blount's friend John Chisholm built Chisholm Tavern facing State Street along the south side of the lot in 1792. Andrew Jackson and John Sevier were frequent visitors to the mansion, and early guests included botanist André Michaux and various Cherokee and Chickasaw chiefs.
Blount transferred ownership of the mansion to their younger half-brother Willie Blount in 1797. Willie Blount deeded the mansion to Blount's son William Grainger Blount in 1818. The Blount family sold the mansion to the McClung family in 1825, and in 1845 Knoxville mayor Samuel B. Boyd had obtained ownership of the property. The Boyd family maintained ownership of the mansion until the early 20th century, renting it out to various private and commercial interests. The Boyds also made several additions to the mansion, including a large Victorian-style porch.
Restoration and preservation
By 1925, Blount Mansion had badly deteriorated. Local developer B.H. Sprankle made plans to level the site and demolish the mansion and outbuildings to make room for a parking lot for the Andrew Johnson Hotel. In response, Mary Boyce Temple of the Bonnie Kate Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution purchased an option on the property, and the following year the Blount Mansion Association was chartered. By 1930, with the help of the DAR, the East Tennessee Historical Society, and the University of Tennessee, the BMA had raised enough money— just over $31,000— to purchase the mansion. The Association immediately initiated efforts to restore the house to its 18th-century condition, removing the Victorian additions and adding period furniture. In 1935 the Knoxville Garden Club assumed the maintenance of the grounds around the mansion.
In 1955, the BMA received a grant from the Tennessee Historical Commission that allowed them to restore Blount's office. The kitchen was rebuilt in 1960 after archaeologists discovered its original foundation. That same year, the discovery of a "vault" in the rear of the house reignited old rumors about an early escape tunnel that supposedly passed under the Tennessee River, but an investigation by the National Park Service determined the "vault" to be a cooling room used for storage of wine and perishable foods. In subsequent years, paint analysis on the exterior and interior walls determined the walls' original color, and the walls were repainted accordingly. Archaeological excavations in 1973 and 1984 uncovered other outbuilding foundations and an assemblage of late 18th-century artifacts. An architectural analysis in the 1990s identified six phases of construction, and suggested that the mansion didn't acquire its full form until around 1815.
Design
Blount Mansion is a frame and clapboard structure consisting of a two-story central block and one-story wings on the east and west ends. The first floor of the main structure contains a parlor, dining room and hallway with a quarter-turn staircase. The second story contains two bedrooms. The west wing contains a single bedroom. The east wing contains a drawing room, and has a basement accessible by stairs and a trap door. Chimneys are located on the east end of the main block and at the outside ends of both wings. The frame was probably built using locally cut timber, but the house's finished woodwork, paneling, flooring and weatherboarding materials were shipped from North Carolina.
Blount's office, often referred to as the Governor's Office, stands behind the west wing of the mansion. The office is a one-story frame-and-clapboard structure with a brick chimney on its south side, and a pair of sash windows with louvered blinds along the east and west walls. The interior includes wide-board paneling and a carved mantel.
The mansion's kitchen had originally been a detached structure located behind the east wing. At an unknown date, this kitchen was dismantled and its materials used to construct an attached rear-wing kitchen. In 1958, archaeologists discovered the foundation of the original kitchen. The rear-wing kitchen was then dismantled and used to rebuild the detached kitchen on its original foundation behind the east wing. The kitchen has a design similar to the office.

Willamette Iron Works (also known as Willamette Iron and Steel Company or WISCO) was a general foundry and machine business established in 1865 in Portland, Oregon, originally specializing in the manufacture of steamboat boilers and engines. In 1904, the company changed its name to Willamette Iron and Steel Works, under which name it operated continually until It's close in 1990.
The works were very busy during both World War I and World War II, building small naval auxiliaries, minesweepers, patrol craft, submarine chasers, and non-self-propelled lighters. These were built through WISCO's relationship with Henry Kaiser. The company built more than 70 ships during World War II, but they were smaller than those built by the three nearby Kaiser Shipyards. The ships were built on contract to the US and British governments.
Between the wars, the shipyard concentrated on building small commercial vessels. During the 1920s, the company manufactured a geared steam locomotive known as the "Willamette", a Shay-type locomotive for use in logging operations in Washington and Oregon. Between 1901 and 1931 Willamette built over 2500 steam donkeys for use in the logging industry.
During World War II Willamette assembled over 800 Russian gauge Baldwin steam locomotives and shipped them to Vladivostok. NW Front Ave. in Portland had a short distance of Russian gauge track for the engines to move from the engine house on the west side of Front to the loading dock on the east side of the street. These were shipped across the Pacific on USSR flagged ships, since the USSR and the Empire of Japan were not at war. A Porter 0-6-0 was bought from the US Government in Panama to switch the broad gauge track.
In the early 1970s, the company manufactured the first three turbine units for the third powerhouse to be built at Grand Coulee Dam.
The company also made fire hydrants for the city of Portland in the late 19th century.
In 1945, after World War II ended, Willamette Iron and Steel continued as mostly a ship repair facility. Over the years, business dropped as larger shipyards grew, and Willamette finally closed in 1990.

Tea is an important part of Russian culture. Due in part to Russia's cold northern climate, it is today considered the de facto national beverage, one of the most popular beverages in the country, and is closely associated with traditional Russian culture. Russian tea is brewed and can be served sweet, and hot or cold. It is traditionally taken at afternoon tea, but has since spread as an all day drink, especially at the end of meals, served with dessert. A notable aspect of Russian tea culture is the samovar, which is used for brewing.
History
There is a wide-spread legend claiming that Russian people first came in contact with tea in 1567, when the Cossack Atamans Petrov and Yalyshev visited China. This was popularized in the popular and widely-read Tales of the Russian People by Ivan Sakharov, but modern historians generally consider the manuscript to be fake, and the embassy of Petrov and Yalyshev itself is fictional.
Tea culture accelerated in 1638 when a Mongolian ruler donated four poods (65–70 kg) of tea to Tsar Michael I . According to Jeremiah Curtin, it was possibly in 1636 that Vassili Starkov was sent as envoy to the Altyn Khan. As a gift to the Tsar, they were given 250 pounds of tea. Starkov at first refused, seeing no use for a load of dead leaves, but the Khan insisted. Thus was tea introduced to Russia. In 1679, Russia concluded a treaty on regular tea supplies from China via camel caravan in exchange for furs. The Chinese ambassador to Moscow made a gift of several chests of tea to Alexis I. However, the difficult trade route made the cost of tea extremely high, so that the beverage became available only to royalty and the very wealthy of Russia. In 1689, the Treaty of Nerchinsk was signed that formalized Russia's sovereignty over Siberia, and also marked the creation of the Tea Road that traders used between Russia and China.
Between the Treaty of Nerchinsk and the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), Russia would increase its caravans going to China for tea, but only through state dealers. In 1706, Peter the Great made it illegal for any merchants to trade in Beijing. In 1786, Catherine the Great re-established regular imports of tea. By the time of Catherine's death in 1796, Russia was importing more than 3 million pounds by camel caravan in the form of loose tea and tea bricks, enough tea to considerably lower the price so that middle and lower class Russians could afford the beverage.
The word “tea” in Russian was first encountered in medical texts of the mid-17th century, for example, in “Materials for the history of medicine in Russia”: “herbs for tea; ramon color (?) - 3 handfuls each” (issue 2, No. 365, 1665, 291), “boiled (probably or the same, but through the Greek “scale”) to a leaf of Khinskiy (typo: khanskiy)”.
The peak year for the Kiakhta tea trade was in 1824, and the peak year for the tea caravans was 1860. From then, they started to decline when the first leg of the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed in 1880. Faster train service reduced the time it took for tea to arrive in Russia from 16 months to seven weeks. The decline in Chinese tea in the mid 19th century in turn meant that Russia began to import more tea from Odessa, and London. By 1905, horse drawn tea transport had ended, and by 1925 caravan as the sole means of transport for tea had ended. In 2002, Russia imported some 162,000 metric tons of tea.
By the late 19th century, Wissotzky Tea had become the largest tea firm in the Russian Empire. By the early 20th century, Wissotzky was the largest tea manufacturer in the world.
By the end of the 18th century, tea prices had moderately declined. The first local tea plant was set in Nikitsk botanical gardens in 1814, while the first industrial tea plantation was established in 1885. The tea industry did not take off until World War I, and greatly expanded following World War II. However, by the mid 1990s, tea production came to a standstill. Today, the main area in Russia for tea production is in the vicinity of Sochi.
Varieties
Traditionally, black tea is the most common tea in Russia, but green tea is becoming more popular.
Traditional tea in Russia includes the traditional type known as Russian Caravan as it was originally imported from China via camel caravan. As the trip was very long, usually taking as long as sixteen to eighteen months, the tea acquired its distinctive smoky flavor from the caravan's campfires. Today, this tea is often given its smoky flavor after oxidation or is a keemun or a "black or oolong from southern China or Formosa (Taiwan) with a hint of smoky Lapsang Souchong or Tarry Souchong."
Brewing
A notable feature of Russian tea culture is the two-step brewing process. First, tea concentrate called zavarka (Russian: заварка) is prepared: a quantity of dry tea sufficient for several persons is brewed in a small teapot. Then, each person pours some quantity of this concentrate into the cup and mixes it with hot water; thus, one can make one's tea as strong as one wants, according to one's taste. Sugar, lemon, honey or jam can then be added freely.
Tea culture
According to William Pokhlyobkin, tea in Russia was not regarded as a self-dependent beverage; thus, even the affluent classes adorned it with a jam, syrup, cakes, cookies, candies, lemon and other sweets. This is similar to the archaic idiom "чай да сахар" (tea and sugar, translit. ). The Russian language utilizes some memes pertaining to tea consumption, including "чайку-с?" ("some tea?" in an archaic manner, translit. ), used by the pre-Revolutionary attendants. The others are "гонять чаи" (chase the teas, i.e. drinking the tea for overly prolonged periods; translit. ) and "побаловаться чайком" (indulging in tea, translit. ). Tea was made a significant element of cultural life by the literati of the Karamzinian circle. By the mid-19th century tea had won over the town class, the merchants and the petty bourgeoisie. This is reflected in the dramas of Alexander Ostrovsky. Since Ostrovsky's time, the duration of time and the amount of tea consumed have appreciated. Alexander Pushkin in Eugene Onegin displayed the role of tea in establishing romantic relations:
Of single boredom, right away
They speak–but in a cunning way.
They call them to their samovar–
None but Dunya will pour the tea;
They whisper to her: "Dunya, see!"
And then produce their sweet guitar.
O Christ! They then begins to cheep:
"Come see me in my golden keep!"
In the Soviet period, tea-drinking was extremely popular in the daily life of office workers (female secretaries, laboratory assistants, etc.). Tea brands of the time were nicknamed "the brooms" (Georgian) and "the tea with an elephant" (Indian). Tea was an immutable element of kitchen life among the intelligentsia in 1960s-'70s.
In pre-Revolutionary Russia there was a joke "что после чаю следует?" ('what follows after tea?', translit. chto poslye chayu slyeduyet) with the correct answer being "the resurrection of the dead" from the Nicene Creed. This is based on the word "чаю" (chayu), the homograph designating formerly "I expect" ("look for" in the creed) and the partitive case of the word "tea", still in use.
Within Russia, tea preparation differs, but usually includes lemon, and sugar or jam. Tea sachets are widely popular, but when a teapot is used it is very common to make a strong brew, then pour some into a cup and top it with hot or boiling water, adding milk and sugar afterwards.
In the 19th century, Russians drank their tea with a cube of sugar (from sugarloaf) held between their teeth. The tradition still exists today.
Tea is very popular in Russian prisons. Traditional mind-altering substances such as alcohol are typically prohibited, and very high concentrations, called chifir are used as a substitute.
Traditional forms of Russian teaware include the Russian tea brewing urn called a samovar, the Lomonosov tea sets adorned with a cobalt blue net design and 22-karat gold, and traditional Russian tea glass holders.
"Russian Tea" in other countries
United States
There is a beverage called "Russian Tea" which likely originated in America. This drink is especially popular in the Southeastern United States where it is traditionally served at social events during Advent and Christmastide. Recipes vary, but the most common ingredients are loose black tea, orange juice (or orange peel), cinnamon, and cloves; some recipes use instant tea powder. Other juices such as lemon and pineapple are sometimes called for. Cream may also be added when serving. A homemade 'instant' variety, often using Tang, has become a popular stocking stuffer in recent decades.
The drink is served hot and often an evening or after-meal beverage. However, iced versions are sometimes offered with meals at cafés.
Despite the name, "Russian Tea" probably has no link to its namesake. References to "Russian Tea" and instructions have been found in American newspapers and cookbooks dating as early as the 1880s.
Japan
In Japan, the term "Russian tea" is used to refer specifically to the act of having black tea with a spoonful of jam, whether added into the cup or placed on the tongue before drinking. The typical choice is strawberry jam, but not exclusively so.

Hufen was a broad region along northwestern Königsberg, Germany, which developed into the quarters of Ratshof, Amalienau, Mittelhufen, and Vorderhufen. The territory is now part of the Tsentralny District of Kaliningrad, Russia.
History
Hufen's name was derived from the system of measurement Hufe, approximately 30 morgens. Under the control of Altstadt by 1286, it was known as Huben by 1300. It originally extended north and west from Steindamm Gate. By 1710 Altstadt had foresters tending to the Kaporner Heath northwest of Königsberg, living along the Alte Pillauer Landstraße on the road to Pillau. Rich Königsbergers began to visit the countryside in summertime. By the end of the 18th century Hufen consisted of the estate Ratshof and the villages Vorderhufen ("near Hufen") in the north, Mittelhufen ("middle Hufen") in the northwest, and Hinterhufen ("further Hufen"), later known as Amalienau. Hardershof developed north of Mittelhufen in the early 19th century.
In 1786 Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder established the Bohlenweg, a road allowing easier access to the estate Pojenter Hof (later the Luisenwahl Park). The Bohlenweg-Verein was an association of villa owners founded at the beginning of the 19th century.
The theologian Ehregott Andreas Christoph Wasianski (July 3, 1755 - April 17, 1831), a friend and biographer of the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant, lived in what would become the Villa Hufenterrasse. In 1812 the Laufenhof manor was converted into the Villa Conradshof. Seven villas burned down in 1826.
Hufen was connected to Lawsken in 1829 by the construction of a chaussee. Hufen increasingly developed into residential suburbs for Königsberg's high society and financiers; notable buildings included Etablissement Conradshof, Park Villa Nova, Villa Hufenpark, Hufenterrasse, Villa Bella, the Konditorei Amende, Birkenhäuschen, Fortuna, Flora, Drachenfels, and Julchenthal.
Amalienau was incorporated into the city of Königsberg (Stadtkreis Königsberg i. Pr) piecemeal on 3 June 1898 and 1 April 1905. Vorderhufen and Mittelhufen were also merged into the city on the latter date. The main thoroughfare through Hufen was Hufen-Allee, which became Kniprodestraße in Steindamm and Neurossgarten at its eastern extremity and extended west to Königsberg's outer suburbs, such as Metgethen and Moditten. Hufen's streets were the first in Königsberg to be uniformly named, often honoring noted personalities from the city's history. The Zahnärztliches Institut, a dental institute, opened on Alte Pillauer Landstraße in 1921 under the direction of Paul Adloff.
While most of Königsberg was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of Königsberg and the 1945 Battle of Königsberg, the quarters of Hufen were relatively unscathed by World War II and have been maintained in modern Kaliningrad.

The White Rabbits were a group of women sculptors who worked with Lorado Taft at the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.
As the date of the world fair's opening grew closer, Taft realized that they would not be able to complete the decorations in time. Discovering that all the male sculptors they had in mind were already employed elsewhere, they asked Daniel Burnham if they could use women assistants, an occurrence that was virtually unheard of at that time. Burnham's reply was that Taft could "hire anyone, even white rabbits, if they can get the work done." Taft, an instructor of sculpture at the Chicago Art Institute who had many qualified women students and who frequently employed women assistants himself, brought in a group of women assistants who were promptly dubbed "the White Rabbits."
The sculptors
From the ranks of the White Rabbits were to emerge some of the most talented and successful women sculptors of the next generation. These include:
Julia Bracken (1871–1942)
Carol Brooks (1871–1944)
Ellen Rankin Copp (1853-1901)
Helen Farnsworth (1867–1916)
Margaret Gerow (whose art career ended with their marriage to sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor)
Mary Lawrence (1868–1945)
Bessie Potter (1872–1954)
Janet Scudder (1869–1940)
Enid Yandell (1870–1934)
Lorado Taft's sister
Related work
Besides their work on the Horticultural Building, several of the White Rabbits obtained other commissions to produce sculpture at the Exposition. Among these were Lawrence's statue of Columbus, placed in front of the Administration Building, Yandell's Daniel Boone for the Kentucky Building, Bracken's Illinois Greeting the Nations in the Illinois Building, and Farnsworth's Columbia for the Wisconsin Building.

Zygmunt Szczęsny Feliński (1 November 1822 in Voiutyn, now Ukraine – 17 September 1895 in Kraków) was a professor of the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy, Archbishop of Warsaw in 1862-1883 (exiled by Tsar Alexander II to Yaroslavl for 20 years),and founder of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary. They were canonised on 11 October 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI.
Early life
Their parents were Gerard Feliński and Eva Wenderoff. They were born in Voiutyn (pol. Wojutyn) in Volhynia (present-day Ukraine) when it was part of the Russian empire. They were the third of six children, of whom two died at an early age. Their father died when they were eleven years old. Five years later in 1838 their mother was exiled to Siberia for a nationalist conspiracy (in which they tried to work to improve the social and economic conditions of the farmers), as a result they only got to see them again as a university student.
After completing high school, they studied mathematics at the University of Moscow from 1840 to 1844. In 1847 they went to Paris where they studied French literature at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France. In Paris they spent time living with Polish exiles, and knew Adam Mickiewicz and was a friend of Juliusz Słowacki.
In 1848 they participated in the Polish uprising against Prussian rule in Poznań.
From 1848 to 1850 they tutored the sons of Eliza and Zenon Brzozowski in Munich and Paris.
Priesthood
In 1851 they returned to Poland and entered the diocesan seminary of Zhytomyr. They studied at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. They were ordained on 8 September 1855 by the Archbishop of Mohilev, Ignacy Holowiński. They were assigned to the Dominican Fathers' parish of St Catherine of Siena in St Petersburg until 1857, when they were appointed as spiritual director of the Ecclesiastical Academy and a professor of philosophy. In 1856 they founded the charitable organization "Recovery for the poor". In 1857 they founded the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary.
Appointment
They succeeded Antoni Melchior Fijałkowski to the Diocese of Warsaw in 1861. Archbishop Fijalkowski and the Polish hierarchy had emphasized the political obedience of Polish people to Russian rule (there had previously been the November Uprising against the Tsar in 1830 that the Pope had condemned in their encyclical Cum Primum in which they stressed the need to obey political rulers).
During the interim between Fijałkowski's death and Feliński's appointment, there had been growing patriotic unrest in Warsaw. Opposition leaders held protests within churches both on grounds of security (as it was presumed the police would not enter the church) and to calm conservative fears that they were not communists. Russia declared martial law in Poland on 14 October 1861, and the following day nationalists staged demonstrations inside Warsaw churches, two of which were broken up by Warsaw police (which led to further scandal, as the public could not accept Russian soldiers in Polish Catholic churches). The Cathedral Vicar ordered all Warsaw churches be closed in protest.
On 6 January 1862, Feliński was appointed archbishop of Warsaw by Pope Pius IX, and they were consecrated in St Petersburg by Archbishop Zyliński. They left the Russian capital on 31 January and arrived in Warsaw on 9 February.
When Feliński was appointed archbishop, they were greeted with suspicion in Warsaw because they were approved by the Russian government. Feliński ordered the re-opening of Warsaw churches on 16 February (he also reconsecrated Warsaw Cathedral and had all churches opened with a solemn 40-hour exposition of the Blessed Sacrament), thus fulfilling the worst fears of the nationalists; they also banned the singing of patriotic hymns, and forbade the use of church buildings for political functions.
The Polish underground press attacked him: an underground Catholic magazine called "The Voice of the Polish Chaplain" wrote about him: under the scarlet robes and the mitre of Father Feliński hides one of those false prophets, against whom Christ told us to be on guard. . . . Every day brings us all sorts of new evidence that Father Feliński does not care for the country at all, that their heart is divided between Petersburg and Rome, and that they want to make the clergy apathetic about the fate of the Fatherland, to turn it into an ultramontane caste that would have nothing in common with the nation."
They defended themselves as a Polish patriot and used the label "traitor" for anyone willing to surrender the dream of independence. They wrote:
The right of nations to independent existence is so holy and undoubted, and the inborn love of the fatherland is so deeply embedded in the heart of every true citizen, that no sophistry can erase these things from the mass of the nation.... All true Poles not only want to be free and independent in their own country, but all are convinced that they have an inaliable right to this, and they do not doubt that sooner or later they will stand before their desires and once again be an independent nation. Whoever does not demand independence or doubts the possibility of its attainment is not a Polish patriot.
During their time as archbishop there were almost daily clashes between the Russian occupiers and the nationalists. The Russian government promoted the image of the archbishop as being their collaborator, thus sowing distrust among people toward him.
In 1862, Pope Pius IX sent a letter to Feliński that criticized the existing civil laws in Russia as being opposed to the teachings, the rights and the freedoms of the Catholic Church, and they called on the archbishop to work for the freedom of those who had been imprisoned for the nationalist cause in Poland. They made every effort to free the imprisoned priests. Feliński worked for the elimination of Russian government control of the Polish Catholic church. They made regular visits to parishes and charitable organizations in the diocese, to better meet their needs. They reformed the programmes of study at the Ecclesiastical Academy of Warsaw and in diocesan seminaries, to give impetus to spiritual and intellectual development of the clergy. They encouraged priests to proclaim the gospel openly, to catechize their parishioners, to begin parochial schools and to take care that they raise a new virtuous generation.
They looked after the poor and orphans, and started an orphanage in Warsaw that they put in the care of the Sisters of the Family of Mary.
In January 1863 there was a major uprising in Poland against Russian rule that ended in failure, and was brutally repressed. Feliński protested against the repression by resigning from the Council of State. They protested against the hanging of Captain Fr. Agrypin Konarski.
In March 1863 Feliński wrote to Tsar Alexander II demanding that Poland be granted political autonomy and be restored to its pre-partition boundaries (including the territories that are now part of Lithuania, Belarus and the western Ukraine). The Tsar answered this letter by arresting Feliński and sending them into exile in the town of Yaroslavl on the Upper Volga (about 300 km to the NE of Moscow; where there were almost no Catholics). The Vatican supported Feliński's protest.
Feliński nevertheless was opposed to the rebellion, as they later wrote in their memoirs:
In my opinion, the question of our behaviour in relation to the partitioning governments must not be resolved wholesale, but must be divided into at least three categories: the question of rights, the question of time, and the question of means. Regarding justice: neither Natural law, nor religion, nor international law, nor finally historical tradition forbids us from attaining with arms the independence that was taken from us by force. From a position of principle, then, no one can condemn us for rising up in arms, as something unjust by its very nature. The question of time and circumstances is only a question of prudence, and only from that perspective can it be resolved....The only area, then, in which it is permissible to judge the justice or injustice of an armed uprising aimed at regaining independence is the means of conducting the struggle, and in this regard our historians and publicists have not only the right, but the obligation to enlighten the national consciousness, so as to warn patriots against adventures that would be ruinous for the national soul.
Their concerns were especially reflected in other conservative Catholic voices that opposed the 1830 insurrection and 1863 rebellion on grounds of the left-wing political radicalism that many of the rebels were associated with, including atheistic ideologies. Feliński claimed revolution attacked both religion and the established social order. The social order of those times, extending into antiquity, was the Polish nobility and Polish clergy believed they were genetically superior to peasants. Peasants were regarded as a lower species.
They called on people to place their trust in the governance of Providence in world affairs:
Whoever manages to always see the finger of Providence in the course of historical events, and trusting in the justice of God, does not doubt that every nation will ultimately receive that which it has earned by its behavior, will recoil with disgust at the thought of committing a crime, even if that would be the only means of fighting an even greater injustice.
Exile
They spent the next 20 years in exile in Yaroslavl. They were not allowed any contact with Warsaw.
During their exile they organized works of mercy to help their fellow prisoners (especially the priests among them), and collected enough funds (despite police restrictions) to construct a Catholic church that would become a new parish. The local people were struck by their spiritual attitudes and referred to them as the "holy Polish bishop".
During their exile they wrote several works that they later published after their release. Included among them were: Spiritual Conferences, Faith and Atheism in the search for happiness, Conferences on Vocations, Under the guidance of Providence, Social Commitments in View of Christian Wisdom and Atheism, and Memories.
Kraków
In 1883, following negotiations between the Holy See and Russia, they were released from exile and moved to Dzwiniaczka in southeastern Galicia (now Дзвинячка in Ukraine) among Ukrainian and Polish crop farmers. The Pope transferred them from Archbishop of Warsaw to Archbishop of the titular see of Tarsus. There they were chaplain of the manor house of Counts Keszycki and Koziebrodski, and they launched into intense pastoral activity. Out of their own money they built the first school and kindergarten in the village. They also built a church and convent for the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary.
They died in Kraków on 17 September 1895 and was buried on 20 September. On 10 October their body was moved to Dzwiniaczka, and their remains were removed again in 1920 to Warsaw, where on 14 April 1921 they were moved to the crypt of the Cathedral of Saint John, where they still are today.
Views on Poland
Feliński criticized Zygmunt Krasiński's claim that Poland was a Christ among nations. Feliński said:
Although my nation was the victim of a cruel injustice," Feliński wrote, "it did not proceed to martyrdom either willingly or without sin, as did our Savior and the martyrs following in Their footsteps. Considering our national guilt and mistakes, it would be more appropriate to call Poland, as it pays for its sins, the Mary Magdalene of nations, not the Christ of nations.
In January 1863 they presented an interpretation of Poland's contemporary history as being a punishment from God for its sins:
The mission of Poland is to develop Catholic thinking in internal life... . Poland was great as long as these virtues lived within it, as long as there were no examples in its history of egoism or rapaciousness... When these national virtues fell, when decadence and egoism set in,
then the flogging and the ruin arrived.
This followed from the views of other Catholic conservatives at the time who believed that God would never grant Poland independence until it repented of its sins. Feliński believed that God would redeem Poland of its sins, and thereby give it independence, but they criticized the independence movement for failing to believe in the role of Providence and (in their view) thinking as though the governance of the world was entirely up to human will. In the view of contemporary Catholic conservatives, in whom Feliński had an important voice, the independence movement, whether it be based on the communist or liberal ideologies that had been adopted by many Polish nationalists, was doomed to failure because of this.
They believed that every nation had a special role given to it by God:
just as every member of the family has an assigned task corresponding to their or their natural abilities, so does every nation receive a mission in accordance with the features Providence deigned to grant it.
From the fact that we lost independent existence, it does not at all follow that our mission has ended. The character of that mission is so spiritual, that not by the force of arms, but by the force of sacrifices will we accomplish that which love demands of us. If independence became a condition necessary for fulfilling the task that has been laid upon us, then Providence itself would so manage the course of events that state existence would again be returned to us, so that we may sufficiently mature in spirit.

Apple Pie Motherhood Band was an American psychedelic rock band formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1967. One of the several groups involved in the "Bosstown Sound", a commercial ploy designed to compete with the San Francisco Sound, the band developed a blend of psychedelia, blues rock, and hard rock, which was exemplified and expanded upon on their two albums. The group went through several line-up changes before disbanding in 1970.
History
The band originated from the garage rock outfit C. C. and the Chasers, who became the house band at the Unicorn Coffeehouse in Boston and released an obscure single, "Put the Clock Back on the Wall", for the small Cori label in 1964. The first line-up consisted of Ted Demos (lead guitar), Joe Castagno (rhythm guitar), Richard Barnaby (bass guitar), Jeff Labes (keyboards), and Jack Bruno (drums), all of whom shared vocals duties. After briefly relocating to New York City in 1965, the group adopted the moniker Sacred Mushroom, and dwelled in psychedelic music. They again became a house band, this time for the Bitter End Cafe, and supported musical acts such as Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. The band recruited female singer Anne Tansey, whom Labes described as "a powerhouse, kind of Janis Joplin with a sweeter voice, but sultry dynamic energy." Them connections in the music industry were responsible for finding their manager, Marv Lagunoff, and for the group's signing to a record label. As a deal with Atlantic Records was pending, the name Sacred Mushroom was deemed too drug-oriented, and, after a humorous remark by Demos, the band was prompted to change it to Apple Pie Motherhood Band in 1967.
The group recorded their first single, "Long Live Apple Pie", with Felix Pappalardi, who is perhaps best known for their work with the psychedelic rock band Cream. Though the single did not break the national charts, it did receive extensive airplay by DJ Dick Summer on Boston's WBZ Radio, as well as on several alternative-music stations just beginning to emerge across the US. The band proceeded to record their debut album, which in one instance was interrupted by Tansey's friend, Jimi Hendrix, who taught and played with the band in jam sessions. However, Tansey soon departed the band and was replaced by Marilyn Lundquist, who performed backing vocals on their co-written composition, "Ice", and a baroque version of David Blue's song, "I'd Like to Know". In some way, all the band members had a share in the writing credits, but Labes composed the majority of the original material. They explained, "I had been writing songs for several years at that point, and found it easy to create appropriate songs for the band. We sounded more like the energy of an East Coast version of what was up in San Francisco at that time." The resulting album, The Apple Pie Motherhood Band, was released in 1968, and mixed extended instrumentals, heavy blues rock, influences of psychedelia and vocal harmonies, and became somewhat of an underground favorite in Boston.
Apple Pie Motherhood Band spent the large portion of 1968 performing in the Greenwich Village and Chicago, opening for musical acts such as Jefferson Airplane, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and The Chambers Brothers. All the while, the group experienced a set of line-up changes, first with Lundquist leaving and Castagno departing, citing an inability to travel for gigs. The band recruited singer Bruce Paine along with guitarist Michael Sorafine and harmonica player Adam Myers. Paine previously worked as a folk singer, but after contractual issues with RCA Records' development of their own album, they were encouraged to join the band. Sorafine and Myers were added in Chicago while the group was performing at the Rush Club, with the latter of the two introducing the members to LSD. When it came time for the group to record for their second album, Apple Pie, the LSD was negatively affecting the sessions, and, consequently, there was a lack of written material. Though Labes composed the majority of original songs, they only penned one track, "Super Music Man", with the rest evenly formulated from the other band members. It was more derived from psychedelic rock, but still contained R&B-flavored cover versions of "I Just Want to Make Love to You", "Get Ready", and "Brown Eyed Handsome Man". However, Apple Pie'''s 1969 release was delayed after their manager disagreed with the group's relocation to a communal farm in Vermont; and, as a result, the band disbanded in the summer of that year to play in the counterculture musical production Hair''.

Manuela Kraller (born 1 August 1981) is a German soprano singer.  They are best known as the former lead singer of symphonic metal band Xandria from late 2010 until late 2013. They were formerly one of the soprano vocalists in the symphonic metal band Haggard. They now have a project that strays away from the metal scene and more of a classical style instead that's called "Valkea Valo" with their friend Tobias Gut.
Musical career
Manuela began their musical life in 2005 at the age of 23 while singing in a Finnish choir group, and discovered their new passion was singing. They began to take classical singing lessons and sang in more church and gospel choirs, and was soon asked to become a solo singer. They grew up with rock and metal music, and wanted to combine it with their classical background, and so began singing rock and metal music songs. They unsuccessfully auditioned to be the new lead singer of Nightwish in 2006.
While writing their own songs, they joined the Swiss band Nagor Mar, but shortly, they left and became a vocalist for German musical group Haggard. They only performed with Haggard live with no studio albums. On 19 December 2010, they became the new singer of Xandria after Lisa Middelhauve finished performing the rest of the live tour dates after Kerstin's departure. On 7 January 2011, they debuted live with Xandria at the "Classic Meets Pop" event at the Seidensticker Halle in Bielefeld, and performed their 2004 hit song, "Ravenheart", with the Bielefeld Philharmonic Orchestra. They then toured with Xandria on the Out of The Dark tour. On 28 November 2011, Xandria announced they would release their first album with Kraller titled Neverworld's End and released the album's first and only single "Valentine" on 14 February 2012, followed by their music video with Manuela. They then went on tour with Epica, Stream of Passion and Kamelot on their Neverworld's End tour.
In August 2013, Manuela has collaborated with the former lead singer of Amberian Dawn singer Heidi Parviainen a duet on their new project Dark Sarah for their future upcoming album.
But as of 25 October, the band announced on their website that Manuela Kraller had left the band to pursue a different career and was succeeded by Dutch singer and Ex Libris frontwoman Dianne van Giersbergen (who is also no longer the frontwoman of Xandria). Manuela leaves the band with regret but also full of gratitude, thanking Xandria and fans for the time together and being grateful for the "wonderful moments in mutual tours and shows". They wished Dianne and the band all the very best for the future.
On 6 April Heidi Parviainen confirmed on Dark Sarah's Facebook page that Manuela Kraller is about to guest again on Dark Sarah's second album called The Puzzle.
Influences
They were inspired by symphonic metal bands. They claim Amy Lee, Tarja Turunen and Anneke van Giersbergen was a very early influences for their singer style, They said Nightwish, Kamelot and Within Temptation are their personal favorites.

The Leonard Falcone International Euphonium and Tuba Festival ("Falcone Festival" or simply "Falcone" for short) is an amateur tuba and euphonium festival and competition, held annually the second week in August at the Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp at Twin Lake, Michigan.
Origin and goals of the festival
Leonard Falcone (b. 1899 Roseto Valfortore, Italy, d. 1985 East Lansing Michigan) was a longtime director of bands and professor at Michigan State University who taught, performed and recorded as a master of the baritone horn and a pioneer of euphonium artistry. The festival was founded by former Falcone students in 1986, to honor their memory. Among its stated goals are to enhance the repertoire of the euphonium and tuba through the commissioning of new works, to promote outstanding artistry on these instruments, and to encourage young people to study them.
Over the years, the Festival has become highly competitive and visible; it is among the most prestigious amateur competitions for both the tuba and euphonium.
Presently, there are four divisions: Student Tuba and Student Euphonium, for players age 20 and younger, and Artist Tuba and Artist Euphonium, for amateur players of any age†, though in reality this translates to college students, mostly at the graduate level.
Developments in the festival
The Falcone Festival has undergone several changes since its inception. Some prominent developments include:
In 1991, the Festival began inviting prominent guest artists to give masterclasses, lessons, and solo recitals, and over the years, numerous new works have been commissioned and premiered at the festival by these artists. It could be said that at this time it truly became a festival, rather than merely a competition. The first such euphonium artist was Brian Bowman.
In 1996, the Festival added Student and Artist divisions for the tuba in addition to the euphonium.
In 2003, the number of players admitted to each Student division was lowered from ten to six.
As of 2007, the requirement that participants in the Student divisions still be in high school has been dropped; the only requirement is that they not have turned 20 by the December 1 following the Festival.
Prestige of the Festival and famous alumni
Many past winners of the Festival's various divisions have gone on to win major performing or teaching jobs. Some well-known Festival alumni include:

Ferne Animal Sanctuary was founded in Dorset, England by Nina Douglas-Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton at the beginning of the Second World War. Since 1975 it has been sited near Wambrook, Somerset.
Beginning
The Duchess was a noted anti-vivisectionist, and was horrified at the British Pet Holocaust.
The intention behind the sanctuary was to provide a temporary refuge for animals belonging to service men and women who had left their homes to fight, or which were likely to be abandoned or euthanased. The Duchess had a statement broadcast on the BBC: "Homes in the country urgently required for those dogs and cats which must otherwise be left behind to starve to death or be shot."
The Duchess established an animal sanctuary at their home, the Ferne Estate in Dorset in 1940. The "sanctuary" was a heated aerodrome (sic) in Ferne. Staff were sent out to rescue pets from the East End of London. Many hundreds of animals were taken back initially to their home in St John's Wood. They apologised to their neighbours who complained about the barking.
Continuation
At the end of the war many owners failed to return to collect their pets and so Ferne Animal Sanctuary took on a more permanent role and since then has given refuge and safety to thousands of animals in the community. The Sanctuary has over 300 rehomed animals on site, including horses, ponies, cattle, mules, donkey, sheep, goats, chickens, guinea pigs, ferrets, chinchillas, degu, tortoises, rabbits and an aviary. All set in the beautiful Blackdown Hills and continues to rehabilitate, rehome or give a place of sanctuary for animals to live out their lives. The Sanctuary relies on public donations and was registered as a charity in 1965, Charity number 1164350.
In 1975, the Sanctuary moved some 50 miles west, to its present premises of 75 acres near Wambrook, Somerset, overlooking the River Yarty valley.
2015 saw the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Sanctuary.

Named after founder George Halas and designed by Peter Rose of Peter Rose + Partners, the building hosts the team's front office, as well as indoor and outdoor practice facilities. The franchise spent $20 million to build the complex in 1997. The location is west of the original Halas Hall, which is now used by the Lake Forest College Athletics Department.
In 2013, the Bears announced that Halas Hall would be renovated to include an event center, broadcast studio, outdoor patio, and dining facility, as well as additional conference rooms and staff offices. They also announced that they would expand the parking lot and renovate the entrance to the lobby. The event centers feature interactive digital displays, video monitors and memorabilia such as the Bears' 1963 NFL Championship Game trophy. The new facility was designed by Richard Preves & Associates, PC. On April 21, 2015, PNC Financial Services purchased the naming rights to the new building, naming it the PNC Center at Halas Hall.
On November 17, 2017, Ted Phillips announced the franchise would expand and renovate Halas Hall to effectively double its size. The project began in March 2018 and concluded in August 2019. After renovations were finished in which training rooms were expanded and new playing fields were added, the Bears moved their training camp to Halas Hall for the 2020 season.

Duncansby Head ( or Dùn Gasbaith) is the most northeasterly part of both the Scottish and British mainlands, slightly northeast of John o' Groats. It lies approximately 20 km (12 mi) east-southeast of Dunnet Head, the northernmost point of both the Scottish and British mainlands. Duncansby Head is located in Caithness, Highland, in north-eastern Scotland. The headland juts into the North Sea, with the Pentland Firth to its north and west and the Moray Firth to its south.
Lighthouse
The point is marked by Duncansby Head Lighthouse, built by David Alan Stevenson in 1924.
A minor public road leads from John o' Groats to Duncansby Head, which makes Duncansby Head the farthest point by road from Land's End.
The Duncansby Head Site of Special Scientific Interest includes the stretch of coast south to Skirza Head. It includes the Duncansby Stacks, prominent sea stacks just off the coast.
Atomic Weapon Test
In 2016, it was reported in The Sunday Post newspaper that scientists from the Atomic Weapons Establishment in Aldemarston had proposed a nuclear weapon test on the Stacks of Duncansby in 1953, but that the prevailing wet weather was too much for contemporary electronics and the idea was shelved.

Aroostook County ( ; ) is a county in the U.S. state of Maine along the Canada–U.S. border. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,105. Its county seat is Houlton, with offices in Caribou and Fort Kent.
Known locally in Maine as "The County", it is the largest county in Maine by total area, and the second largest in the United States by land area east of the Mississippi River, behind St. Louis County, Minnesota. With over of land it is larger than three U.S. states. It is Maine's northernmost county. Its northernmost village, Estcourt Station, is also the northernmost community in New England and in the contiguous United States east of the Great Lakes.
Aroostook County is known for its potato crops. The county is also an emerging hub for wind power. Its Acadian culture is also well-known. In the Saint John Valley in the northern part of the county, which borders Madawaska County, New Brunswick, many of the residents are bilingual in English and Acadian French, whereas elsewhere in Maine, New England French is the predominant form of French spoken.
History
The sparsely populated Maine North Woods, roughly defined as the headwaters of the Saint John, Penobscot and Kennebec Rivers, was populated through the colonial era by refugees fleeing unfriendly governments. Native Americans retreating from hostile European colonists, and smugglers trading with these Native Americans and between English Massachusetts and French Acadia lived in small communities along the Atlantic coast on the disputed border between those colonies. As England dominated the Gulf of Maine following the French and Indian Wars, these occupants of the border region retreated up the large rivers into the interior joined by Acadians escaping the Acadian Expulsion. Although the survivors might have preferred to remain independent, surrounding governments dividing their refuge perceived Aroostook County as the west bank of the Saint John River drainage upstream of Canada. Under United States control, the area was initially dominated by lumber manufacturing interests, although agriculture became important as population increased. Transportation along the Saint John River and early rail connections into New Brunswick caused strong business links with Canada until the county was connected to the United States rail network by the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad in 1894. Aroostook County residents retain an independent cultural identity established during their history of isolation on the border frontier.
Aroostook County was formed in 1839 from parts of Penobscot and Washington counties. In 1843, Aroostook gained land from Penobscot County; in 1844, Aroostook again gained land from Penobscot, plus it exchanged land with Piscataquis County. In 1889, Aroostook gained slightly from Penobscot, but gave back the land in 1903 when Aroostook County gained its final form.
Some of the territory in this county was part of the land dispute that led to the "Aroostook War" that would be settled by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty.
The county was also part of a route on the Underground Railroad, and was one of the last stops before entering Canada. Slaves would meet and hide just outside Aroostook or in deserted areas. Friends Quaker Church near Fort Fairfield was often a final stop.
Much of Aroostook County's economy was dominated by military spending through the Cold War. Limestone Army Air Field was built in Limestone, Maine in 1947. It was renamed Loring Air Force Base (AFB) in 1953 as the home of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) 42d Bombardment Wing operating Convair B-36 Peacemaker bombers. Aroostook County was chosen due to its strategic location as the closest point in the Continental United States to the Middle East and Europe including the Soviet Union west of the Ural Mountains. Loring AFB could accommodate one hundred of these large bombers; and had both the largest fuel storage capacity, at , and the largest weapons storage capacity, at 4700 tonnes NEW, of any SAC base. The 42d Bombardment Wing at Loring operated Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers until the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closure and the base closed in 1994.
The 2014 Acadian World Congress was held along the Canada–United States border, co-hosted by Aroostook County and a number of neighboring counties in Canada (Témiscouata in Quebec, and Victoria, Madawaska and Restigouche in New Brunswick). Organizers planned a Tintamarre that was held in the town of Madawaska, Maine, as well as a giant tug of war across the Saint John River.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (2.3%) is water. Aroostook County is Maine's largest county by area, about the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. The county high point is Peaked Mountain, elevation , whose western slopes are in the north east corner of Piscataquis County.

Government and politics
Although the county is more socially conservative than Maine's southern and coastal counties, it was won by the Democratic Presidential candidate in the six elections from 1992 – 2012 before going for the Republican candidate in 2016. In the Maine Legislature, the county's delegation in 2013 included three Democrats and seven Republicans. In 2009 it voted 73% in favor of a referendum rejecting same-sex marriage and 54% against the Maine Medical Marijuana Act. In 2012, it voted 67% against a measure to legalize same-sex marriage in Maine, the highest opposition percentage of any county in the state. From 2016 to 2020, the margin increased from 55-38% to 59-39%, respectively. This makes Aroostook County the only county in New England to have a more major Republican shift.
Due to the remoteness from the rest of Maine and a perceived lack of connection with the Maine government, as well as a strong connection with neighboring Canada, politicians of Aroostook County, Maine, have proposed making Aroostook part of New Brunswick or spinning off the county as its own state, probably named Aroostook, since the 1990s. As recently as 2005 the question has been brought up before the state legislature.

Prominent international orchestras perform their contemporary works, both their popular music and classical pieces are played on radio stations, while their music is presented in several theatres.
Life
They commenced their musical studies at Erkel Ferenc Primary School for Music, and later studied at Weiner Leó Secondary Music School, specializing in composition and piano. They continued their music education at Bartók Béla Secondary Music School between 2002 and 2006, where the primary focus of their studies was composition as a student of Prof. Miklós Kocsár. After finishing high school in 2006, they were admitted to the Liszt Academy and graduated in 2011 as student of Prof. Gyula Fekete. In 2013 they studied at the Academy of Music in Kraków for a semester on an Erasmus scholarship in the class of Prof. Wojciech Widłak. In 2017, they were awarded a scholarship for the New National Excellence Program and a year later, in 2018 they received their summa cum laude doctoral degree. Since 2019, they have been a senior lecturer at the Liszt Academy.
In 2009, they were the youngest awardee of the first New Hungarian Music Forum composer competition organized by Müpa Budapest and the Budapest Music Center. This award has brought significant recognition for him, followed by several propositions to compose theatre music. This was followed by their ensemble piece Chuang Tzu's Dream which was acclaimed in the "under 30" category by several classical music radio stations by the International Music Council in Lisbon in 2010. This piece was performed – amongst others – by the London Sinfonetta. In the same year, they were awarded the Junior Prima Award (given to those under the age of 30 for outstanding achievements in different fields) as the first composer to receive this recognition. In 2011 one of their pieces, written for a play of the Hungarian National Theatre, was given the Theatre Critics Award. Later, they received the Erkel Ferenc Award in 2016, and the Bartók-Pásztory Award in 2019.
Their pieces are performed in festivals and concert halls such as the , the and the in Munich, the Lucerne Festival Academy, the CAFe Budapest Contemporary Art Festival, the Mini Festival, the Hungarian State Opera, a Philharmonie de Paris and the Juilliard School.

On 26 June 2017, Chuang Tzu's Dream was performed in the world-famous Tonhalle in Zurich, accompanied by works from composers such as Péter Eötvös, György Kurtág, Máté Balogh, Balázs Horváth and Péter Tornyai. The concert was conducted by Péter Eötvös. In 2018 their piece Lethe was played by the orchestra of the Lucerne Festival Academy in the Elbphilharmonie. Their music has been staged in the Hungarian National Theatre, the Comedy Theatre of Budapest, the Budapest Operetta Theatre, the Budapest Puppet Theatre and the Hungarian State Opera. In 2017 their music composed for the movie Halj már meg! (Just Drop Dead) was nominated in the "Best Composer" category at the Hungarian Film Awards.

They compose several genres from popular to contemporary music, but primarily considers themselves a contemporary composer. They do not aim to create an interchange between different genres. They consider it their mission to integrate Generation Y and Z into the classical music scene, making this genre both attractive and comprehensible for them.  They are a member of the Artisjus Committee of Classical Music Critics, the Association of Hungarian Composers and the "Musician/Composer" section of the Hungarian Film Academy Association.  They are one of the founder of the contemporary composer group, created in 2016.

The 1964 Kingston upon Thames Council election took place on 7 May 1964 to elect members of Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council in London, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party gained control of the council.
Background
These elections were the first to the newly formed borough. Previously elections had taken place in the Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe and Municipal Borough of Surbiton. These boroughs were joined to form the new London Borough of Kingston upon Thames by the London Government Act 1963.
A total of 172 candidates stood in the election for the 60 seats being contested across 24 wards. These included a full slate from the Conservative and Labour parties, while the Liberals stood 42 candidates. Other candidates included 9 Residents and 1 Communist. There were 16 two-seat wards, 4 four-seat wards and 4 three-seat wards.
This election had aldermen as well as directly elected councillors. The Conservatives got 9 aldermen and Labour 1.
The Council was elected in 1964 as a "shadow authority" but did not start operations until 1 April 1965.
Election result
The results saw the Conservatives gain the new council with a majority of 20 after winning 40 of the 60 seats. Overall turnout in the election was 43.0%. This turnout included 389 postal votes.

3LCD is the name and brand of a major LCD projection color image generation technology used in modern digital projectors. 3LCD technology was developed and refined by Japanese imaging company Epson in the 1980s and was first licensed for use in projectors in 1988. In January 1989, Epson launched its first 3LCD projector, the VPJ-700.
Although Epson still owns 3LCD technology, it is marketed by an affiliated organization simply named after the technology:"3LCD". The organization is a consortium of projector manufacturers that have licensed 3LCD technology to be used in their products. To date, about 40 different projector brands worldwide have adopted 3LCD technology.
According to electronics industry research company Pacific Media Associates, projectors using 3LCD technology comprised about 51% of the world's digital projector market in 2009.
3LCD technology gets its name from the three LCD panel chips used in its image generation engine.
How 3LCD technology works
Creating Colors from White Light:
A projector using 3LCD technology works by first splitting the white light from the lamp into its three primary colors of red, green and blue by passing the lamp light through special dichroic filter / reflector assemblies called “dichroic mirrors.” Each dichroic mirror only allows specific colored wavelengths of light to pass through while reflecting the rest away. In this way, the white light is split into its three primary color beams and each is directed toward, and subsequently through its own LCD panel.
Image Generation at the LCDs:
The three LCD panels of the projector are the elements that receive the electronic signals to create the image which is to be projected. Each pixel on an LCD is covered by liquid crystals. By changing the electrical charge given to the liquid crystals, each pixel on an LCD can be darkened until it is totally opaque (for full black), lightened until it is totally transparent (allowing all the lamp light to pass through for full white) or shaded in varying degrees of translucence (for different shades of gray). This is similar to how a digital watch's characters appear bold and black on its LCD when its battery is new, but start to fade gradually as its battery weakens. In this way, the brightness level on every pixel for each primary color can be very precisely controlled to produce the final pixel's specific color and brightness level required on the screen.
Color Image Recombination and Projection:
After each colored light is filtered through its individual LCD panel, the beams are recombined in a dichroic prism that forms the final image which is then reflected out through the lens.
Competition
For mainstream projectors, the competitors to 3LCD technology are single-chip DLP technology (developed by Texas Instruments) and to a much lesser extent, LCOS projection technology.
Advantages
Proponents of 3LCD projection technology claim that it has the following advantages over it the closest competing technologies:
3LCD projectors can have higher color light output than single-chip DLP projectors. This is because 3LCD projectors mix and project the light beams from all three colors to form each individual pixel's color, while single-chip DLP projectors create colors by projecting them in sequence one at a time and rely on human color perception to mix and interpret the correct colors for each pixel.
3LCD projectors typically use less power compared to a single-chip DLP projectors of the same brightness rating.
The way a single-chip DLP projector works sometimes causes viewers to see a "rainbow" or "color breakup" effect where false colors are briefly perceived when either the image or the observer's eye is in motion. As all three primary colors are displayed all the time by 3LCD projectors, they do not suffer from this effect.
3LCD projectors are able to display finer image gradations by giving each pixel on the projected image a smooth variation in brightness levels. This is because the liquid crystals for each pixel on an LCD panel can be given fine levels of opacity by varying the electrical charge. On the other hand, a single-chip DLP projector has a single mirror reflecting the lamp light to the lens on its DMD chip for each pixel. It varies the brightness of each pixel by vibrating the mirror between its on or off state in varying frequencies and relies on human perception to interpret the brightness of each pixel.
3LCD projectors are typically more affordable than those using LCOS or 3-chip DLP technologies.
Disadvantages
Older 3LCD projectors with large pixel pitches usually have a "screen door effect"
Single-chip DLP projectors typically have higher contrast ratios compared to older 3LCD models of similar price or brightness rating.
The smallest single-chip DLP projectors are smaller than the smallest 3LCD projector models.
Current LCOS projector models typically deliver sharper images at higher resolutions than 3LCD projectors.

Otto Schultz (31 May 1920 – 28 July 2013) was a German Luftwaffe ace and recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross during World War II.
As part of JG 51 operating near Tunis, Schultz scored their first western victory on 1 December, downing a Spitfire. In December, the Gruppe was very successful over the new American pilots - claiming 50 victories while losing only two of their own. But as in Russia, in 1943, the superior numbers soon made their impact. In August, orders transferred II./JG 51 to Munich to retrain as a specialist anti-bomber unit.
With Romania's surrender to Soviet forces in late August, and its subsequent declaration of war against Germany, II./JG 51 retreated to Yugoslavia. Left as final air-cover for the army retreating out of Greece, 6./JG 51 reportedly engaged their former allies in Romanian-flown Bf 109s. Schultz was reportedly credited with 73 aerial victories in about 820 combat missions.

Henry Lee Warner (23 July 1688 – 13 December 1760) was an English landowner and Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1711 to 1713.
Warner was the son of Henry Lee and their wife Dorothy Howe, daughter of Sir George Grobham Howe, 1st Baronet and their wife Elizabeth Grimston. They were educated at Christ Church, Oxford and entered Inner Temple in on 26 March 1706.
Supported by their uncle Sir James Howe, 2nd Baronet Warner was elected Member of Parliament for Hindon on 15 May 1711 and held the seat until 1713. They made little impact in parliament although they saw through an Act of Parliament concerning their inheritance of family estates that were left to their deceased brother. They decided not to stand in 1713 and instead they undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, visiting France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands until 1716. On their return they settled at Walsingham Abbey in Norfolk together with their father. In 1736 they inherited the manor of Berwick St Leonard, Wiltshire from their uncle Sir James.
Warner died at the age of 72 leaving their son lands in six counties.
Warner married Mary Milles, daughter of Samuel Milles of Herne and Nackington who was MP for Canterbury. They had four sons and a daughter.

A Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) is a person responsible for conducting clinical trials using good clinical practice (GCP) under the auspices of a Principal Investigator (PI).
Good clinical practices principles have been defined by Madelene Ottosen, RN, MSN, of The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston as:
Trials are conducted ethically, as defined by the Declaration of Helsinki, rigorously, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines (ICH).
Benefits outweigh risks for each patient.
Rights, safety and well-being of patients prevail over science.
All available non-clinical and clinical information on any investigational agent can support the trial as designed.
All trials are scientifically sound and clearly described.
All clinical trials have current Institutional Review Board approval.
Medical decisions and care are the responsibility of qualified health care professionals, specifically physicians and, if applicable, dentists.
Everyone involved in the clinical trial is qualified by training, education and experience.
Informed consent is given freely by every participant.
All study documentation is recorded, handled and stored to allow accurate reporting, interpretation and verification.
Confidentiality of subjects is respected and protected.
Investigational products maintain Good Manufacturing Practice in storage, manufacturing and handling.
Systems to ensure quality are implemented in all aspects of the trial.
The PI is responsible for the conduct of the trial, however, "CRCs are often involved in essential duties that have been traditionally performed by the PI, such as conducting the informed consent process and ensuring compliance with the protocol." The CRC's primary responsibility, as with all clinical research professionals, is the protection of human subjects, but the CRC has many other responsibilities. Although not inclusive, some of the CRC responsibilities include preparing the Institutional Review Board submission, writing the informed consent document, working with the institutional official in contract negotiations, developing a detailed cost analysis, negotiating the budget with the Sponsor (i.e., pharmaceutical company or granting agency), subject recruitment, patient care, adverse event reporting, preparing the case report form (CRF), submitting CRFs and other data to the Sponsor as necessary and study close-out.
Responsibilities
Feasibility
A sponsor sends a feasibility questionnaire to the local research site. The Clinical Research Coordinator completes the form on behalf of the site to determine if the local site has the patient population, support staff, medical facilities, and equipment necessary to successfully carry out the study protocol.
Institutional Review Board submissions
All research involving human subjects must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each IRB has protocol submission requirements, which typically involve an IRB application and informed consent document. A study cannot begin without IRB approval.
Informed consent
The IRB must approve informed consent prior to study initiation, and often the CRC is liaison between the IRB and the sponsor. The sponsor sets informed consent requirements, as does the IRB. Each local IRB must review and approve the informed consent, but the CRC is responsible for communication between the IRB and the sponsor. §46.116 of the Code of Federal Regulations outlines the basic elements of informed consent as a:
Statement that the study involves research, an explanation of research purpose, expected duration of subject's participation, description of procedures, and identification of any experimental procedures
Description of any reasonably foreseeable risk or discomfort to the subject
Description of any benefits to the subject or others that can reasonably be expected
Disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject
Statement that describes extent, if any, to which confidentiality subject identity is maintained
Explanation (if more than minimal risk to test subject) as to any compensation, medical treatments available if injury occurs and, or where further information is available
List of whom to contact for pertinent questions about the research and subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject
Statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate involves no penalty or loss of benefits, and that the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits
Additional elements
When appropriate, experimenters also tell each subject:
That the particular treatment or procedure may involve unforeseeable risks to the subject (or to an embryo or fetus, if relevant)
Circumstances under which investigator may end subject's participation without subject's consent
Additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research
Consequences of subject withdrawing from the research, and procedures for orderly termination of subject participation
That significant new findings during the research that could affect the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject
The approximate number of subjects involved in the study
Contracting with pharmaceutical companies
The site conducting the clinical trial negotiates the clinical trial agreement (CTA) to conform to its policies and procedures. The resolution of many contractual issues requires coordination between the sponsor, the PI and the site, which is usually the responsibility of the CRC. The involvement of each party is essential to a successful CTA with mutually acceptable terms. The CTA should include terms for indemnification, confidentiality, publication, intellectual property, insurance, data safety and monitoring boards, subject injury, governing law and termination clauses.
Cost analysis and budget negotiations
To develop a cost analysis, the CRC reviews the protocol schema and determine which procedures are standard of care, versus research. Research charges are included in the budget—with personnel effort, site initiation costs, IRB fees throughout the life of the clinical trial, pharmacy costs, travel costs for the PI and CRC to attend investigator meetings, equipment, dedicated fax and computer lines, supplies, screen failures, subject stipends, subject travel costs, and any other items defined as a direct cost to the clinical trial. In addition, if the clinical trial is at an Academic Medical Center (AMC), an indirect cost rate applies to the direct study costs. The indirect rate is approximately 30% for pharmaceutical trials, and can be upwards of 50% for federal trials, depending on the AMC's federally negotiated indirect costs rate.
Subject recruitment
Prior to agreeing to conduct the clinical trial, the CRC (and the PI) determine if they have the appropriate patient population. The CRC is responsible for subject recruitment once the trial begins, or must establish the research team that recruits subjects. Viable subject recruitment must occur beforehand, as the clinical trial agreement stipulates the number of subjects the site must recruit.
Patient care
The CRC coordinates and conduct patient care visits and assures that all procedures comply with the protocol. The CRC interacts with the PI to assure the patient receives appropriate medical evaluation and care when needed and alerts the PI of any serious adverse events that occur during the study.
Adverse events
An adverse event is described as "any adverse change in health or "side-effect" that occurs in a person who participates in a clinical trial while the patient is receiving the treatment (study medication, application of the study device, etc.) or within a pre-specified period of time after their treatment has been completed." The CRC must report all adverse events to the sponsor and all serious adverse events to the IRB and sponsor.
Case report forms
The purpose of the case report form (CRF) is to collect relevant data in accordance with the protocol and in compliance with regulatory requirements. The CRC collects the data on the CRF and submit to the sponsor either electronically or paper format.
Electronic Data Capture
The electronic data capture (EDC) is an online database where the information collected on the Case Report forms (CRF), or source documents is entered. These are usually created by the study sponsor or their subcontractors.
Processing and shipping of laboratory samples
Many Clinical Trials and non-clinical research studies use laboratory assessments/samples to assess patient response and or Adverse Events. The CRC is frequently responsible for the basic laboratory preparation of labs samples such as making hematology slides, spinning and aliquoting blood samples or placing tissue in formalin or flash freezing. These blood or tissue samples may be analyzed locally or sent to central laboratories for processing and analysis. The CRC must abide by The International Air and Transportation Association regulations (IATA) for biologic sample shipments.
Study close
In accordance with the local IRB, the CRC completes IRB study close documentation and appropriately notifies study subjects, research team, and pharmacies. The CRC works with the sponsor's clinical monitor to complete outstanding monitoring findings and queries. In addition, the CRC must comply with record retention policies of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the ICH, and the clinical trial agreement.

Eschenrode is a village and a former municipality in the Börde district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the town Oebisfelde-Weferlingen.
Geography
Eschenrode lies about 5 km southeast of Weferlingen, between Lappwald and the Flechtingen Hills. The nearest large towns are Braunschweig, Wolfsburg and Magdeburg.
It is surrounded on three sides by woods. Nearby lies the abandoned village of Nievoldhagen.
Neighbouring municipalities
These are: Hödingen, Hörsingen, Bartensleben, Schwanefeld, Walbeck and Weferlingen.
History
The oldest mention of "Haskenroth" is in a confirmation document of the pope Hadrian IV for Mariental Abbey in 1158. Because the Eschenroder church dates from Hildegrim of Châlons († 827), traditionally the first bishop of the diocese of Halberstadt and said to have founded 35 parish churches, it is presumed clearly older than Eschenrode itself. The church became in the middle of the 11th century the archdeacons' church. The Halberstädter bishops beside the aristocratic own churches bishop subordinated directly Kirchenbezirke created. The church district of Eschenrode enclosed from Bartensleben to Grafhorst 22 churches. 1224 this was transferred Archdeacon Eschenrode of the Probstei Walbeck and lost to meaning.
Population
The number of residential buildings (54), has changed only slightly since 1842.
Partnerships
Eschenrode has a partnership with Lehre in Lower Saxony.
Church
The local church is dedicated to Saint Stephen which has a rare Bodeorgel, a baptismal angel and a bell, which according to the Nievoldhagen legend, was found in the forest. Nievoldhagen was a settlement whose foundation walls of the former church, are all that remains.
Transportation
Eschenrode is about 11 km from the B 1 which connects Braunschweig with Berlin. The nearest Autobahn is the A 2 which can be reached via the Alleringersleben exit (64), which is 14 km away.

A small-lift launch vehicle is a rocket orbital launch vehicle that is capable of lifting up to (by NASA classification) or up to (by ROSCOSMOS classification) of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO). The next larger category consists of medium-lift launch vehicles.
The first small-lift launch vehicle was the Sputnik rocket, launched by the Soviet Union, which was derived from the R-7 Semyorka ICBM. On 4 October 1957, the Sputnik rocket was used to perform the world's first satellite launch, placing the Sputnik 1 satellite into a low Earth orbit.
NASA responded by attempting to launch the Vanguard rocket. However, the Vanguard TV3 launch attempt failed, with the 31 January 1958 launch of the Explorer 1 satellite using the Juno I rocket being the first successful NASA orbital launch. The Vanguard I mission was the second successful NASA orbital launch. This was the start of the space race.
Since the late 1950s, small-lift launch vehicles have continued launching payloads to space. Medium-lift launch vehicles, heavy-lift launch vehicles, and super heavy-lift launch vehicles have also been extensively developed but have not completely been able to supersede the small launch vehicles. Small launch vehicles can meet the requirements of some spacecraft, and can also be less expensive than a larger launch vehicle would be.

The Mabry–Hazen House is a historic home located on an site at 1711 Dandridge Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee, at the crest of Mabry's Hill. Also known as the Evelyn Hazen House or the Joseph Alexander Mabry Jr. House, when constructed in 1858 for Joseph Alexander Mabry II it was named Pine Hill Cottage. The house was in what was then the separate town of East Knoxville. Stylistically, the house exhibits both Italianate and Greek Revival elements. Additions in 1886 increased the size of the first floor. Having operated as a museum since the death of Evelyn Hazen, the house retains its original furniture and family collections, including antique china and crystal with over 2,000 original artifacts on display making it the largest original family collection within America. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
At the outset of the American Civil War, Joseph Mabry II, a wealthy Knoxville merchant and importer, pledged $100,000.00 to outfit an entire regiment of Confederate soldiers. Because of this assistance to the cause, they were given the honorary title of General in the Confederate army. During the course of the war, both Union and Confederate forces occupied the strategic site of their house adjacent to Fort Hill. Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer set up their headquarters in the house in 1861, but it was Union forces who had the greatest impact when they fortified the grounds as part of their Knoxville defenses after later taking control of Knoxville.
After Mabry's death in 1882, their daughter Alice Evelyn Mabry and their husband Rush Strong Hazen resided in the house. Their youngest daughter, Evelyn Hazen, later occupied the house alone (except for many pet dogs and cats) for many years until their death in 1987. Them will stipulate that the house had either to become a museum or be razed to the ground. The house opened as a museum in 1992.
Cemetery
Knoxville's Confederate Cemetery, also known as Bethel Cemetery, located at 1917 Bethel Avenue, occupies near the house, and is owned by the same museum foundation. It contains the graves of approximately 1,600 Confederate soldiers, 50–60 Union men (prisoners) and 20 veterans. The cemetery also contains a high monument erected in 1892, consisting of a Tennessee marble obelisk topped by a Confederate soldier facing north. The cemetery property includes a frame caretaker's house, built circa 1881, known as the Winstead Mansion.
In literature
Three generations of the occupants of the Mabry–Hazen House have been referenced in literary works. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain wrote about the gunfight that killed the home's builder Joseph Mabry II, and their son, Joseph III (known as Joseph Jr.). Mabry's daughter married Rush Strong Hazen, a benefactor to Leonora Whitaker Wood, whose life was fictionalized in the novel, Christy. In 2007, author Jane Van Ryan published The Seduction of Miss Evelyn Hazen, a book chronicling the sensational lawsuit between Knoxville socialite Evelyn Hazen, granddaughter of General Mabry, and Ralph Scharringhaus, to whom they were once engaged.

USS Sea Poacher (SS/AGSS-406), a , was a vessel of the United States Navy named for the sea poacher, a slender, mailed fish of the North Atlantic.
Sea Poacher (SS-406) was built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 20 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. H. Spiller, wife of Commander Spiller, hull superintendent at the Navy Yard; and commissioned on 31 July 1944.
World War II
Following underway trials, training, and shakedown in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, areas, Sea Poacher transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 October 1944. Although their first two war patrols were unproductive, during the third, conducted in the Kuril Islands area, Sea Poacher torpedoed and sank a Japanese trawler and, four days later, sent two fishing boats to the bottom in a surface attack. During the latter action, three crewmen were injured when the 20 millimeter gun exploded. Due to the seriousness of their injuries, the patrol was terminated ahead of schedule, and the submarine returned to Midway.
After conducting their fourth war patrol off the eastern coast of Honshū and Hokkaidō, Sea Poacher was undergoing refitting at Pearl Harbor when the war ended on 15 August 1945.
1946 – 1974
From 1946 to 1949, Sea Poacher was based at Balboa, Canal Zone, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) engaging in fleet exercises and antisubmarine training, and, on 1 June 1949, was transferred to Key West, Florida, as a unit of SubRon 4. In 1951, the submarine became the first GUPPY IA conversion performed at the Charleston Naval Shipyard.
For the remainder of their 25-year career, Sea Poacher operated for the most part in the Key West and Caribbean areas, providing services to various units of the Atlantic Fleet with time out for tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and various exercises with NATO forces. On 10 July 1952, while operating in the Key West area, the submarine had the unique experience of rescuing a blimp which had suffered an engine casualty and was floating helplessly in the water. The submarine promptly came to the aid of the stricken airship and proceeded to tow it the back to its base at Naval Air Station, Boca Chica, Florida.
In July 1959, Sea Poacher was transferred to SubRon 12, also based at Key West, and continued to serve as a unit of this squadron for the remainder of their active service. In the fall of 1962, Sea Poacher was deployed with other Atlantic Fleet units maintaining the quarantine imposed on Cuba during the missile crisis.
In 1969, Sea Poacher concluded their service with a -month deployment to the eastern and northern Atlantic areas to participate in antisubmarine training exercises with units of the Spanish and Portuguese navies. Upon returning to Key West, the submarine operated locally and in the Caribbean until 20 October when they set sail for Philadelphia and in-activation. Sea Poacher was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-406 on 1 November, decommissioned on 15 November 1969, and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia. On 30 June 1971, they reassumed the designation of a fleet submarine (SS). On 15 August 1973, their name was struck from the Navy List, and the submarine was sold to Peru in July 1974.
BAP La Pedrera (S-49)
Sea Poacher was transferred (sold) under terms of the Security Assistance Program, to Peru, 1 July 1974. They were commissioned into the Peruvian Navy, initially as BAP Pabellón de Pica (S-49), but their name was changed a few weeks later to La Pedrera. They were taken out of service in 1995, and relegated to pierside training.
Honors and awards
As Sea Poacher, they received four battle stars for World War II service.

Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site is a property in Baddeck, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada, overlooking the Bras d'Or Lakes. The site is a unit of Parks Canada, the national park system, and includes the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site, which contains the largest repository of artifacts and documents from Bell's years of experimental work in Baddeck. This site was designated a National Historic Site in 1952.
Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site
The site features artifacts donated in 1955 from the Bell family's personal museum, located in the Kite House at Beinn Bhreagh. The site also features memorabilia associated with Bell's experiments, including: the original hull of a hydrofoil boat, the HD-4, that set a world marine speed record in Baddeck by reaching speeds of over 112 km/h (over 70 mph) in 1919; a full-scale replica of that boat; the AEA Silver Dart which in 1909 J.A.D. MacCurdy piloted up into the air over the ice of Baddeck Bay to become the first controlled heavier-than-air craft to be flown in the British Empire—plus many other exhibits and documents from Bell's years of research activities on the transmission of speech and sound by wire and by light, as well as their experiments with kites, planes and high speed boats. The museum also features displays relating to Bell's work with in the field of deaf education and how it led to the invention of the telephone. The Alexander Graham Bell Historic Site was designed by Canadian government architect O. Howard Leicester, R.I.B.A. The architects for the Museum building were the Canadian architecture firm of Wood, Blachford, Ship (A. Campbell Wood, Hugh W. Blachford, Harold Ship).
In addition to its displays, the museum features an observation deck on the roof of the building offering a view of Bell's Beinn Bhreagh estate, across the bay. Beinn Bhreagh is a separate National Historic Site, still privately owned and occupied by Bell's descendants. It is not in the national park system and is not open to the public.

Pingtung County is a county in Southern Taiwan. It has a warm tropical monsoon climate and is known for its agriculture and tourism. Kenting National Park, Taiwan's oldest and largest national park, is located in the county. The county seat is Pingtung City.
Name
The name Pingtung means "east of Banping mountain", referring to a nearby mountain known as Banping mountain ().
History
Early history
Aboriginal inhabitants of Liuqiu Island (13 km [8 mi] southwest of Taiwan, and now part of Pingtung County) killed Dutch sailors on two occasions. In response, in the spring of 1636, Dutch sailors carried out a punitive campaign that became known as the Lamey Island Massacre.
Modern-day Pingtung County and Kaohsiung City were part of Banlian-chiu (萬年州; Bān-liân-chiu) during the Kingdom of Tungning (1661–1683) and Fongshan Prefecture (鳳山縣; Hōng-soaⁿ-koān) during Qing dynasty rule (1683–1895).
Until the seventeenth century, this area of Taiwan was a place of exile for Chinese criminals and the occasional landing point for international mariners. Only the settlements near present-day Checheng Township existed. In 1664, the Hakka settlers arrived from mainland China and farmed under a homesteading system introduced by Zheng Jing.
Pingtung City, the biggest city in Pingtung County, also known as "A-Kau" (阿猴; A-kâu, English: the forest), was the home of Taiwanese Plains Aborigines.
In 1684, settlers from China's southern Fujian region created the first Han Chinese villages near Pingtung. By 1734, most of the Pingtung Plain was cultivated, and Pingtung was expanded in 1764. In 1836, the government and locals worked together to build the city's four walls (the North Gate, the East Gate, the West Gate, and the South gate), and the roads were completed.
In March 1867, fourteen American sailors were killed near Kenting by local aborigines in the Rover incident, which lead to the failed American Formosa Expedition three months later. In 1871, local aborigines killed 54 sailors from Ryukyu in the Mudan Incident. The Japanese carried out a punitive campaign against the local aborigines in the 1874 Japanese invasion of Taiwan.
Empire of Japan
Under Japanese rule (1895–1945), was initially under , but political divisions frequently changed between 1895 and 1901. In 1901, was established. In 1909, the name changed to . In 1920, the name was changed to and was under Takao Prefecture administration, which consisted of modern-day Pingtung County and Kaohsiung.
Republic of China
Following the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China on 25 October 1945, the area of present-day Pingtung County was incorporated into Kaohsiung County on 25 December 1945. On 16 August 1950, Pingtung County was established after being separated from Kaohsiung County. a On 1 December 1951, Pingtung City was downgraded from provincial city to county-administered city and made the county seat of Pingtung County.
Pingtung was the site of a 7.1 magnitude earthquake on 26 December 2006. In 2009, due to Typhoon Morakot, Pingtung received over of rainfall, breaking records for any place in Taiwan struck by a single typhoon.

The lowest nighttime temperatures are around 16 °C (61 °F), due to distance from the sea.
Central Pingtung, such as the coastal Fangliao Township, has a lower daytime temperature and warmer nights due to the regulating effect of the ocean, which is especially noticeable during winter.
The mildest climate of Pingtung is at its southern tip, the Hengchun Peninsula, which is nearly surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.

The Democratic Renewal Party (Indonesian: Partai Demokrasi Pembaruan (PDP)) was a political party in Indonesia. It was established in 2005 by former members of the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI-P) who were once close aides of party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri. Following the 2005 PDI-P congress, differences appeared over the nature of democratic methods within the party. A group of people, including Petrus Selestinus, took the view that although the PDI-P was a modern political party, it still used the old authoritarian methods such as giving absolute prerogative rights to the party chairperson and having only one candidate for senior positions. This group then established the Democratic Renewal Party. Unlike the PDI-P, it had a system of collective leadership, with 35 people forming the national leadership.
The party contested the 2009 elections, but won only 0.9 percent of the vote, less than the 2.5 percent electoral threshold, meaning it gained no seats in the People's Representative Council.
Following its poor result in the 2009 vote, the party joined nine other smaller parties to form the National Unity Party ().

In Māori mythology the primal couple Rangi and Papa (or Ranginui and Papatūānuku) appear in a creation myth explaining the origin of the world (though there are many different versions). In some South Island dialects, Rangi is called Raki or Rakinui.
Union and separation
Ranginui first married Poharua Te Po where they bore 3 offspring including Aorangi (or Aoraki as given in South Island). They later married Papatūānuku together becoming the primordial sky father and earth mother bearing over 70 children including Tāwhirimātea, Tāne and Tangaroa, all of whom are male. Both Ranginui and Papatūānuku lie locked together in a tight embrace, and their sons forced to live in the cramped darkness between them.
These children grow and discuss among themselves what it would be like to live in the light. Tūmatauenga, the fiercest of the children, proposes that the best solution to their predicament is to kill their parents. But their brother Tāne disagrees, suggesting that it is better to push them apart, to let Ranginui be as a stranger to them in the sky above while Papatūānuku will remain below to nurture them. The others put their plans into action—Rongo, the god of cultivated food, tries to push their parents apart, then Tangaroa, the god of the sea, and their sibling Haumia-tiketike, the god of wild food, join him. In spite of their joint efforts Rangi and Papa remain close together in their loving embrace.
After many attempts Tāne, god of forests and birds, forces their parents apart. Instead of standing upright and pushing with their hands as their brothers have done, they lie on their back and pushes with their strong legs. Stretching every sinew Tāne pushes and pushes until, with cries of grief and surprise, Ranginui and Papatūānuku were pried apart. Traditions of the Taranaki region, however, assign this separating role to Tangaroa, god of the sea.
War in heaven and earth
And so the children of Ranginui and Papatūanuku see light and have space to move for the first time. While the other children have agreed to the separation, Tāwhirimātea, the god of storms and winds, is angered that the parents have been torn apart. They cannot bear to hear the cries of their parents nor see the tears of Ranginui as they are parted, they promise their siblings that from henceforth they will have to deal with their anger. They fly off to join Rangi and there carefully fosters their own many offspring who include the winds, one of whom is sent to each quarter of the compass. To fight their brothers, Tāwhirimātea gathers an army of their children —winds and clouds of different kinds, including fierce squalls, whirlwinds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, hurricane clouds and thunderstorm clouds, and rain, mists and fog. As these winds show their might the dust flies and the great forest trees of Tāne are smashed under the attack and fall to the ground, food for decay and for insects.
Then Tāwhirimātea attacks the oceans and huge waves rise, whirlpools form, and Tangaroa, the god of the sea, flees in panic. Punga, a son of Tangaroa, has two children, Ikatere father of fish, and Tu-te-wehiwehi (or Tu-te-wanawana) the ancestor of reptiles. Terrified by Tāwhirimātea's onslaught the fish seek shelter in the sea and the reptiles in the forests. Ever since Tangaroa has been angry with Tāne for giving refuge to their runaway children. So it is that Tāne supplies the descendants of Tūmatauenga with canoes, fishhooks and nets to catch the descendants of Tangaroa. Tangaroa retaliates by swamping canoes and sweeping away houses, land and trees that are washed out to sea in floods.
Tāwhirimātea next attacks their brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike, the gods of cultivated and uncultivated foods. Rongo and Haumia are in great fear of Tāwhirimātea but, as they attack them, Papatūānuku determines to keep these for their other children and hides them so well that Tāwhirimātea cannot find them. So Tāwhirimātea turns on their brother Tūmatauenga. They use all their strength but Tūmatauenga stands fast and Tāwhirimatea cannot prevail against him. Tū (or human kind) stands fast and, at last, the anger of the gods subsided and peace prevailed.
Tū thought about the actions of Tāne in separating their parents and made snares to catch the birds, the children of Tāne who could no longer fly free. They then made nets from forest plants and casts them in the sea so that the children of Tangaroa soon lie in heaps on the shore. They made hoes to dig the ground, capturing their brothers Rongo and Haumia-tiketike where they have hidden from Tāwhirimātea in the bosom of the earth mother and, recognising them by their long hair that remains above the surface of the earth, they drag them forth and heaps them into baskets to be eaten. So Tūmatauenga eats all of their brothers to repay them for their cowardice; the only brother that Tūmatauenga does not subdue is Tāwhirimātea, whose storms and hurricanes attack humankind to this day.
There was one more child of Ranginui and Papatūānuku who was never born and still lives inside Papatūanuku. Whenever this child is kicking the earth shakes and it causes an earthquake. Rūaumoko is their name and they are the god of earthquakes and volcanoes.
Yearning
Tāne searched for heavenly bodies as lights so that their father would be appropriately dressed. They obtained the stars and threw them up, along with the moon and the sun. At last Ranginui looked handsome. Ranginui and Papatūanuku continue to grieve for each other to this day. Ranginui's tears fall towards Papatūanuku to show how much they love them Sometimes Papatūanuku heaves and strains and almost breaks themselves apart to reach their beloved partner again but it is to no avail. When mist rises from the forests, these are Papatūānuku's sighs as the warmth of their body yearns for Ranginui and continues to nurture humankind.

Unleashed in the East is the first live album by the English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released in September 1979 on Columbia Records. It was recorded live over two nights in Tokyo during their Hell Bent for Leather Tour in February 1979. Upon release Unleashed became the band's best-selling album up to that point, reaching the US Top 100 and the UK Top Ten, eventually the album became one of the five Judas Priest albums to gain a RIAA platinum certification. It is the first Priest album to be produced by Tom Allom who would remain at the helm for the next decade for the band, and the last release to feature drummer Les Binks.
To what extent the album was really live remains a matter of contention, with the album sometimes being called Unleashed in the Studio. Years later, after they had left Priest, Rob Halford noted in various interviews that the music was indeed live, but that their vocals had been ruined in the original recording and were later dubbed in a concert-like studio setting.
Reissues
The 2001 CD reissue featured four "bonus tracks", "Rock Forever," "Delivering the Goods," "Hell Bent for Leather" and "Starbreaker", which had been issued on the 7" bonus disc that came with the original 1979 Japanese vinyl release. Three of these were from their then-current album Killing Machine (released in the US as Hell Bent for Leather), which was not well represented on the original release. "Delivering the Goods" and "Starbreaker" had been exclusive to the Japanese release, although the former would be one of the B-side tracks to the "Living After Midnight" 12 inch, released in March 1980.
These four tracks were previously available on the Japanese pressing of the album (titled Priest in the East and having the same track-list as to remaster), and were recorded at the same time as the original nine tracks. Additionally, two more songs were recorded from the same concerts but were only available as B-sides on various singles:
"Evil Fantasies" was on the "Living After Midnight" 12 inch, along with "Delivering the Goods." This live version of "Evil Fantasies" had an official CD release on Single Cuts (2011), albeit with a 6-second edit to the start, which trims Halford's chat slightly.
"Beyond the Realms of Death" was pressed with "Rock Forever" and "Hell Bent for Leather" on a special 3 track live EP that came with initial UK pressings of "Unleashed In The East". There is also a 1979 UK cassette version with 12 songs: "Rock Forever", "Hell Bent for Leather" and "Beyond the Realms of Death" in addition to the original 9 tracks. To date, this version of 'Beyond the Realms of Death' has not been released on CD.
All the extra songs are fully produced, and are of the same quality as the original nine tracks. Certain bootlegs have turned up with all fifteen tracks in the original setlist order, to better reflect the actual concerts of the 1979 tour. (For the record, all the Unleashed in the East recordings were taken from shows on 10 February 1979 at Kosei Nenkin Kaikan Tokyo, and 15 February 1979 at Nakano Sunplaza Tokyo. Additionally, there were two shows on 10 February: an afternoon and an evening show. The two 10 February shows can be found as a bootleg under the title "Tyranny Unleashed In The East.") Two more songs, "White Heat, Red Hot" and "Take on the World" were performed but never officially recorded.
However, the "Take On the World" 12 inch single, released in late 1978, included a live version of "White Heat, Red Hot" recorded at The Agora in Cleveland, Ohio on 9 May 1978 (on the Stained Class Tour). Live versions of "Beyond the Realms of Death" and "Starbreaker" recorded from the same 1978 Cleveland show were released as b-sides to the "Evening Star" 7 inch single and "Take on the World" 12 inch single, respectively. These tracks are available on the Priest, Live and Rare CD. They are not the same versions as on Unleashed in the East. The band was possibly trying to avoid repetition by not including songs on the official full-length live album that were already available as live versions on singles.

Whimsey glass, also known as "whimsy", "whimsies", "wimsy" and "wimsies", and also as friggers or end-of-days (as they were often made at the end of the work day) is work that is created for no useful purpose, so named as it was made on a whim, or whimsey, of the glassmaker. The name may also refer to the fanciful or whimsical style of much of this sort of work.
Glassmakers would make whimsies on their breaks or at the end of the day with any extra molten glass left in the pot. They would often bring the objects home to their families. It became one of the most sought-after styles of glass during the 19th-century, especially representations of boots and shoes, though this style of glass is first recorded in 15th-century Germany. During the 19th century its popularity was as a souvenir but also due to its display in trade exhibitions.

Phacelia formosula is a rare species of flowering plant in the borage family known by the common name North Park phacelia. It is endemic to the state of Colorado in the United States, where it is known only from the North Park region in Jackson County. It is threatened by a number of human activities, such as motorcycle and off-road vehicle use in its habitat. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.
This plant was first collected on August 6, 1918, near Walden, Colorado. It was placed on the US Endangered Species List on September 1, 1982. There are eight to eleven occurrences of the plant for a total of fewer than 5000 individuals. All but two of the occurrences are small.
This biennial herb grows to a maximum height around 22 centimeters. The leaves have blades deeply cut into lobes. The inflorescence is a scorpioid cyme, an array of branches curved into a curl that resembles the tail of a scorpion. Blooming occurs in July and August. The flowers are pollinated by insects, including the pollen wasp Pseudomasaris zonalis.
The plant only grows in North Park, a large basin in northern Colorado. There it is limited to ravines and bare slopes of eroding rock originating from the Coalmont Formation. The substrate is sandy and rust-colored and it contains coal. Few other plants grow on the slopes.
The decomposing rock slopes are popular with off-road vehicle users. The vehicles erode the substrate, disturbing the plants. Other threats include trampling and grazing by livestock, coal extraction, and petroleum exploration.

John Downing Fripp (February 11, 1921 – March 24, 2022) was a Canadian skier and football player. They were a skier between 1927 and 1960 and played football in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) (now CFL East Division) and Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) between 1941 and 1947. A centenarian, Fripp was believed to be the oldest former Canadian football player at the time of their death.
Early life
Johnny Fripp was born on February 11, 1921, in Ottawa, Ontario. They attended high school at Lisgar Collegiate Institute, before transferring to Glebe Collegiate.
Skiing career
Fripp started skiing at the age of 6, and won multiple tournaments as a youth. In 1938, at the age of 17, they won the Journal Trophy at the Gatineau Ski Zone Championships. However, the trophy was awarded to someone else as they were not old enough to be eligible.
Due to their young age, they could not compete at the Dominion Championships and instead went to compete against the Americans in the Eastern Olympic try-outs held at Lake Placid, New York. They were beaten by national champion Dick Durrance, but won third place in both slalom and downhill events.
Fripp again won the Journal Trophy one year later, and also placed second in the Quebec Kandahar combined race, earning first place honors in downhill. They were champion of the Kandahar race in 1940, and won the Eastern Canadian Championships with first place in both slalom and downhill events.
Later that year in Sun Valley, Idaho, they competed against American and Austrian professionals and placed 16th out of 80 competitors. Also in 1940, they were named an assistant professional ski instructor at Mont Tremblant.
Their sports career was interrupted in 1942 by World War II. As a member of the skiing team of the Royal Canadian Air Force, they won an event held at Mount Baldy Ski Area and recorded the fastest time ever by a Canadian skier. After returning from the war, Fripp again won the Quebec Kandahar race. They also won the Alta Cup competition in Alta, Utah.
They retired shortly afterwards, but returned in 1951 and won their third Quebec Kandahar tournament. They won the Canadian Open Class Downhill Championships in 1953, and was Canada's top entrant to the 1954 Ryan Cup.
They were appointed by the Canadian Federation Internationale de Ski (FIS) to be the coach of the men's team in 1958 to compete in Bad Gastein. They also served as director of the Canadian Amateur Ski Association in 1957, and was a member of the International Competition Committee in 1958. They retired in 1960.
Football career
Fripp began to play football for the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) at 20 years old in 1941. They played the flying wing position. They made their debut on September 27, in a 18–5 win over a Montreal team. An article in The Montreal Gazette said, "Johnny Fripp, one of Canada's greatest skiers and last year's one-man football team at Glebe Collegiate, was shoved into the battle as a momentary replacement for Andy Tommy in the second quarter." After being put in, they were immediately given the ball on a short end play and "made yards". Their rushes were described as "bull-like" by The Montreal Gazette. They made a "fine debut", according to The Ottawa Journal.
Controversy arose after the game, when Montreal Star writer Baz O'Meara claimed they were ineligible to play due to their skiing career. James P. McCaffrey, league president, declined to comment on Fripp.
Fripp remained in the league, and scored their first touchdown in a 24–6 win over the Toronto Argonauts on October 25. They were out of the league in 1942 when games were suspended due to World War II. They returned to football the following year, playing on the Lachine Fliers military service team. After then spending another year out of football, Fripp played for the Montreal Hornets of the IRFU in 1945.
They re-joined the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1946, appearing in eleven games. They returned to the team in 1947, but left before the season start for the Ottawa Trojans of the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU). They played one season with the Trojans, appearing in seven games, before retiring from football.
Later life
Their father, Herbert, founded a real estate and insurance firm in 1923, H. D. Fripp & Son Ltd., and Johnny Fripp took over in 1950.
They were inducted into the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1988, and one year later was an inductee to the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame. In 2020, they were reported to be the oldest former Ottawa Rough Rider, and believed to be the oldest former Canadian football player at the time. Fripp celebrated their 100th birthday on February 11, 2021. They died on March 24, 2022, one year later at age 101.

Warriors of God () is a historical novel with fantasy elements, written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to Narrenturm in the Hussite Trilogy. Its events take place in Bohemia and Silesia, during the time of Hussite Wars.
The trilogy is to be published in late August 2021 by Orbit in the US and Gollancz in the UK, who have purchased the rights. It will be translated by David French, who has worked with Sapkowski on The Witcher series.
Plot
The plot of the book Warriors of God follows the previous part of Sapkowski's trilogy, Narrenturm. The reader mainly follows the protagonist of the whole story, the Silesian nobleman, doctor and magician Reinmar from Bělava, who after their escape from Silesia joined the Czech Hussites and became a member of the orphans' union.
Reinmar, who became an ardent supporter of the chalice after leaving home, went to northern Bohemia together with their friend Šarlej, who had become a member of the Tábor union in an effort to acquire property.
It was there that they decided to look for the wizard Rupilius Slezák, with whose help their mysterious friend and alleged astral Samson Medák would be able to return to their world. Reynevan, who was also being followed in Bohemia by the Silesian Inquisition and the servants of the bishop of Wrocław, was captured by their enemies in Trosky Castle, from where they were only able to escape with the help of the sorcerer Rupilia.

Jutulhogget is a long dry canyon in the municipalities of Alvdal and Rendalen in Innlandet county, Norway. The canyon was created by the rupture of the dam of a proglacial lake and the force of the rushing water leaving the lake carved out the canyon. The canyon was protected as a nature reserve in 1959. The steep walls of the canyon range from in height.
The canyon was formed at the end of the last Ice Age, around years ago. The proglasial lake Nedre Glomsjø was dammed up by glaciers stopping the water from running southward. As the amount of meltwater rose, it eventually broke through its earthen boundaries and formed a new outlet heading eastward through a weakness zone in the bedrock. The lake drained through to the Rendalen valley, at an estimated . The pressure of the water quickly dug through the rock, and the rock and formed the canyons in a matter of days. To the early settles downstream, this would have been a cataclysmic and sudden event.

Waterbeach Barracks' is a former military installation in Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire. The site was an RAF Station, RAF Waterbeach and then used by the Royal Engineers, part of the British Army, from 1966, until 2013 when the site closed to make way for housing.
History
In 1966 the station and airfield remained the property of the Ministry of Defence, but was transferred from the Royal Air Force to the Royal Engineers, part of the British Army. Until the closure of nearby RAF Oakington in the early 1970s, the main runway at Waterbeach remained active, along with the control tower, and was used as a relief landing ground for Varsities used in the advanced pilot training role. The barracks, airfield and surrounding quarters most recently housed 12 (Air Support) Engineer Group. The former airfield was used as a training area for troops, with occasional visits by helicopters and, in the past, by Harriers. 25 Engineer Regiment was disbanded on 19 April 2012. Two of its squadrons (34 Field Squadron and 53 Field Squadron) have become part of 39 Engineer Regiment and will move to RAF Kinloss.
In July 2011 the Ministry of Defence announced that Waterbeach Barracks will close, and the site sold for housing. In November 2011 and March 2012 the Ministry of Defence announced that 39 Engineer Regiment would move to Kinloss Barracks in July 2012. A total of 930 Service personnel will move to Kinloss, and 44 Service personnel to Wittering. HQ 12 (Air Support) Engineer Group will move from Waterbeach to RAF Wittering in October 2012, with the complete closure of Waterbeach Barracks by 1 April 2013.
First units of 39 Engineer Regiment (Air Support) arrived at Kinloss Barracks in June 2012, with the majority leaving Waterbeach during July. Their move was complete by September 2012. Waterbeach Barracks closed on 28 March 2013.
Future Development
The site was subject to an MOD disposal process by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, and in August 2014 Urban&Civic were appointed as Development Partners. In October 2015 they held open days for local residents to tour the site and meet the design team, as the first stage of their consultation on the development of the MoD site and surrounding farmland, as new settlements. Regular Newsletters for local residents are being issued. In December 2015 a community engagement report on the Open Days was published by David Lock Associates, for Urban&Civic, which includes the open day display boards.
During 2016 design workshops are being held bringing together the Urban&Civic and RLW Estates design teams, key local authority partners, the parish council, neighbourhood plan working group, and local residents.
The Ministry of Defence has announced that disposal will not take place before 2022.
Waterbeach Military Heritage Museum
In June 1984, a station museum was established by the Army to record and preserve items from RAF Waterbeach - in particular, from 514 Squadrons, who hold their reunions at the barracks every year - as well as artefacts from the Army (39 Engineer Regiment). Although the barracks closed in March 2013, the Museum closed to visitors on 30 September 2012.
In 2011, John Hamlin, an aviation historian and the museum curator, wrote a book documenting the history of RAF Waterbeach and Waterbeach Barracks, to raise money for the museum. In 2014, it was updated to include closure and contact information
In December 2012, a group of villagers sets up a trust, the Waterbeach Military Heritage Museum, and the Army gifted the collection to it. The barracks museum contents were stored outside the barracks. The honorary curator from the barracks continued to answer enquiries and carry out research. They had an assurance from the most likely developers of the MOD-owned airfield and barracks (RLW Estates, and then Urban & Civic) that the inclusion of a Museum would form an important part of the site's heritage.
During 2015, the museum started the move back into its building at the barracks, and it was formally re-opened on 17 June 2017. The building was also made available to community groups and for use as workshops by Urban & Civic.

Analog Heart is the debut solo studio album by American singer-songwriter David Cook. All songs on the album were written by him. Though originally released as an independent record on May 6, 2006, Analog Heart sales jumped during Cook's appearance on the seventh season of American Idol.
Analog Heart won the Urban Tulsa Weekly'''s "Absolute Best of Tulsa" award for "Best Locally Produced, Independent Album" in 2007. The album was chosen as the fourth-best CD released in 2006 by website Music Equals Life.
On April 18, 2008, Analog Heart was listed as the number one album for "Today's Top MP3 Albums" on Amazon.com, and David Cook was listed as number one for "Today's Top MP3 Artists". Soon thereafter, the album was removed from Amazon. The album sold 900 copies in its last week before being removed, and 300 the week before that. Prior to those two weeks, according to Nielsen SoundScan data, the album had not sold more than 5 copies in a single week.
In an article published on USAToday.com on May 23, 2008, Cook explained to reporters in a conference call why Analog Heart had to be removed from Amazon: "About midway through the season, I had to have the record pulled, obviously, for fairness issues on the show. And I got it pulled offline. But somebody, I have no idea who, reposted it on Amazon, so while that was going on, I was kind of at a loss. I talked to Amazon about getting it pulled, and there was a bunch of mass confusion about it. I'm extremely appreciative at how well it did. But I was kind of a pawn in that whole game." Nonetheless, other pre-Idol'' albums from Brooke White, Carly Smithson and Kristy Lee Cook remained on the market.

The 1962–63 Football League season was Birmingham City Football Club's 60th in the Football League and their 36th in the First Division. They finished in 20th position in the 22-team division, two points clear of the relegation places. They entered the 1962–63 FA Cup at the third round proper and lost in that round to Bury after a replay. They entered the League Cup at the second round and reached the final, in which they defeated local rivals Aston Villa 3–1 on aggregate score to win the first (and, until 2011, only) major trophy in their history.
Because of the severe winter weather – the so-called "Big Freeze of 1963" – Birmingham played no matches for ten weeks, between 22 December and 2 March. Their third-round FA Cup-tie was played in the first week of March, two months later than the usual date of the first weekend in January.
Twenty-three players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were eleven different goalscorers. Half back Terry Hennessey played in 52 of the 53 first-team matches over the season (forwards Ken Leek and Mike Hellawell missed only two), and Leek finished as leading goalscorer with 29 goals, of which 20 were scored in league competition.

FA Cup
Because of the severe winter weather – the so-called "Big Freeze of 1963" – Birmingham played no matches for ten weeks, between 22 December and 2 March. Their opening third-round FA Cup-tie against Bury was postponed 14 times and abandoned once before finally being played two months after the originally scheduled date.
League Cup
The first leg of the final, against Birmingham's near neighbours Aston Villa, was played on 23 May at St Andrew's. Birmingham took the lead when Jimmy Harris fed Bertie Auld who crossed for Ken Leek's powerful shot, but Aston Villa equalised via Bobby Thomson. Seven minutes into the second half, the same combination of players made it 2–1, and after 66 minutes Jimmy Bloomfield "ended an excellent run by scoring from a narrow angle, earning even the applause of Villa players" to give Birmingham a 3–1 lead. The second leg, four days later at Villa Park, was goalless. Former England centre half Trevor Smith marked Thomson out of the game, Birmingham's defensive tactics included repeatedly kicking the ball out for throw-ins, and Aston Villa were unable to break their opponents down.

The Northbrook Public Library, located at 1201 Cedar Lane, serves the 33,170 residents of the Village of Northbrook, Illinois. The library received 470,700 visitors and circulated 856,000 items from its collection of 337,300 books, audio materials and videos in 2012. Library Journal gave the Northbrook Public Library its highest rating of 5 stars in 2012 and 2013 based on circulation, visits, program attendance and public internet use per capita.
History
The Northbrook Public Library first opened on June 30, 1952, following a referendum spearheaded by Bertram Pollak, president of the Northbrook Civic Association, C. E. Barthel, Jr., who became the library board president, and Carolyn A. Landwehr, who became the library board secretary. The library was originally housed in meeting and office space at the village hall (now the Northbrook Civic Foundation building) with a capacity for 6,500 volumes. Freda Thorson was the first librarian. In 1953, the Northbrook Civic Association provided funds of $27,500 to build a new, one-story library at the corner of Shermer and Church Street that could accommodate 12,000 volumes. The new library was dedicated on March 21, 1954.
By 1967, the library had exceeded its capacity with a collection of 31,000 volumes, and voters approved a referendum for a new building at the library's current location at the corner of Cedar and Cherry, on the bank of the West Fork of the North Branch of the Chicago River. The library was designed by the architecture firm of Hammond and Roesch and cost $1 million. The new steel frame building had 28,000 square feet of floor space and room for 110,000 volumes. The main part of the library was on a single floor raised above ground level to provide views and to protect the collection from the river flooding. The design earned a Distinguished Building Award from the Chicago Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Opening day was May 25, 1969.
The library building has undergone two major expansions. In 1999, a $10.5 million addition gave the library a new third floor—housing the fiction and multimedia collections—as well as an enlarged children's department, study rooms, classrooms, and banks of computer terminals on the second floor. In 2014, a $6.5 million construction project began to renovate the first floor meeting rooms and create a modern auditorium with tiered seating.
In 2021 the main lobby was remodeled with a new mural, new self checkout machines, a new automated sorting machines, and many more new upgrades.

Alison Margaret Smithson (22 June 1928 – 14 August 1993) and Peter Denham Smithson (18 September 1923 – 3 March 2003) were English architects who together formed an architectural partnership, and are often associated with the New Brutalism (especially in architectural and urban theory).
Personal lives
Peter was born in Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham, north-east England, and Alison Margaret Gill was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire. Peter served in the Madras Sappers and Miners in India and Burma, then returned to finish their architectural studies. They met while studying architecture at Durham University and married in 1949. They joined the architecture department of the London County Council as Temporary Technical Assistants before establishing their own partnership in 1950.
Of their three children, Simon, Samantha and Soraya, one, Simon, is an architect.
Alison Smithson published a novel A Portrait of the Female Mind as a Young Girl in 1966.
Studies
Alison Smithson studied architecture at King's College, Newcastle (later the Newcastle University School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape), then part of the University of Durham, between 1944 and 1949. Peter Smithson studied architecture at the same university between 1939 and 1948, along with a programme in the Department of Town Planning, also at King's, between 1946 and 1948.
Work
The Smithsons first came to prominence with Hunstanton School, Norfolk completed in 1954, which used some of the language of high modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe but in a stripped back way, with rough finishes and a deliberate lack of refinement that kept architectural structure and services exposed. They are arguably among the leaders of the British school of New Brutalism. They referred to New Brutalism as "an ethic, not an aesthetic". Indeed, their work sought to emphasize functionality and connect architecture with what they viewed as the realities of modern life in post-war Britain. Their definitions and interpretation of Brutalism put them at odds with their contemporary Reyner Banham, an architecture critic known for their work in defining the stylistic components of New Brutalism. Alison Smithson articulated their desire to connect building, users, and site when, describing architecture as an act of "form-giving", they noted: "My act of form-giving has to invite the occupiers to add their intangible quality of use." After the critical success of Hunstanton School, they were associated with Team X and its 1953 revolt against old Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) philosophies of high modernism.
Among their early contributions were 'streets in the sky' in which traffic and pedestrian circulation were rigorously separated, a theme popular in the 1960s. They were members of the Independent Group participating in the 1953 Parallel of Life and Art exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and This Is Tomorrow in 1956. Throughout their career they published their work energetically, including their several unbuilt schemes, giving them a profile, at least among other architects, out of proportion to their relatively modest output.
Peter Smithson's teaching activity included the participation for many years at the ILAUD workshops together with fellow architect Giancarlo De Carlo.
National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/24) with Peter Smithson in 1997 for its Architects Lives' collection held by the British Library.
Built projects
Their built projects include:
Smithdon High School, Hunstanton, Norfolk (1949–54; a Grade II* listed building)
The House of the Future exhibition at the 1956 Ideal Home Show
Family house for acoustician and engineer Derek Sugden, Watford (1956)
Upper Lawn Pavillion, Fonthill Estate, Tisbury, Wiltshire (1959–62)
Office towers for The Economist, members accommodation for Boodles, bank and art gallery, St James's Street, London - often known as the Economist Plaza (1959–65)
Garden building, St Hilda's College, Oxford (1968)
Private house extension for Lord Kennet, Bayswater, London, 1960
Robin Hood Gardens housing complex, Poplar, East London (1969–72)
Buildings at the University of Bath, including the School of Architecture and Building Engineering (1988)
Their last project: the Cantilever-Chair Museum of the Bauhaus design company TECTA in Lauenfoerde, Germany
Robin Hood Gardens was under construction when B. S. Johnson made a short film about the couple for the BBC, The Smithsons on Housing (1970). Sukhdev Sandhu, in a blog entry for the London Telegraph website, wrote that "they drone in self-pitying fashion about vandals and local naysayers to such an extent that any traces of visionary utopianism are extinguished." The finished flats suffered from high costs associated with the system selected and from high levels of crime, all of which undermined the modernist vision of 'streets in the sky' and the Smithsons' architectural reputation. In 2017, with the flats set to be demolished, a three-storey section including a walkway and maisonette interiors was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum.
They would go on to design several buildings at Bath, while relying mainly on private overseas commissions and Peter Smithson's writing and teaching (he was a visiting professor at Bath from 1978 to 1990, and also a unit master at the Architectural Association School of Architecture).
Unbuilt proposals
Their unbuilt schemes include:
Coventry Cathedral unsuccessful competition entry, 1951
Golden Lane Estate unsuccessful competition entry, 1952
Sheffield University, unsuccessful competition entry
Hauptstadt, unsuccessful competition entry, 1957
British Embassy, Brasília, competition-winning design, unbuilt due to financial constraints, 1961

Sailor Free is an Italian progressive rock band, originally formed in 1991.
History
Sailor Free was conceived in Rome, by four musicians from the city's local scene: drummer Stefano Toni, bassist Alfonso Nini, guitarist Stefano Barelli and singer/keyboardist David Petrosino. Toni was the only member who had previous success, with the punk rock band "Lunar Sex".
The band released their self-titled debut album in 1992, through the Italian label Tide Records. Distribution was handled separately by Flying Records, and a short tour of Italy followed.
1994 saw the arrival of Sailor Free's second album, “The Fifth Door”. It was released by The Labyrinth, an imprint of the Laser's Edge label. The album and subsequent tour garnered positive reviews from critics and fans alike.
In 1996, the band took an extended break to rest and work on other musical projects.
“The Fifth Door” was reissued in 2004. Noted for its unique style, the album attracted new fans while rekindling the interest of older ones.
After reforming in 2010, Sailor Free produced a short film titled “A Dream Of Cans”. It featured the song "Daeron", which was the first single from their forthcoming album. The film became an official selection at the 2011 Lenola Film Festival.
The band's third album, "The Spiritual Revolution (Part 1)", was released in 2012. It was a concept album, inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien's “Silmarillion” and the Spiritual Revolution movement. In reviewing the album, critic G. W. Hill wrote, "The mix of progressive rock sounds here is quite diverse. At times I hear Pink Floyd, at other points King Crimson. Still other sections are quite spacey. All in all, it works to create an effective album." Music Waves described the album as pleasant, but uninspired. The review further stated that the band's performance was good, but without great virtuosity. Donato Zoppo of Movimenti Prog called it "un album ambizioso e complesso" ("a complex and ambitious album").

Barbada de Barbades is the stage name of Sébastien Potvin, a Canadian drag queen most noted as one of the drag house mothers in the first season of the reality competition series Call Me Mother.
Career
Potvin, the Black Canadian son of a Barbadian father and a Québécois mother, first began performing in drag when they entered the 2005-Star Search drag competition at Cabaret Mado. Although they were eliminated from the competition, they entered again in 2006 and won. They continued to perform regularly in drag at Cabaret Mado, becoming one of the club's regular headliners and winning Rita Baga's Mx Fierté pageant in 2017.

In geometry, an equilateral pentagon is a polygon in the Euclidean plane with five sides of equal length. Its five vertex angles can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons. In contrast, the regular pentagon is unique, because it is equilateral and moreover it is equiangular (its five angles are equal; the measure is 108 degrees).
Four intersecting equal circles arranged in a closed chain are sufficient to determine a convex equilateral pentagon. Each circle's center is one of four vertices of the pentagon. The remaining vertex is determined by one of the intersection points of the first and the last circle of the chain.
Examples
Internal angles of a convex equilateral pentagon
When a convex equilateral pentagon is dissected into triangles, two of them appear as isosceles (triangles in orange and blue) while the other one is more general (triangle in green). We assume that we are given the adjacent angles and .
According to the law of sines the length of the line dividing the green and blue triangles is:
The square of the length of the line dividing the orange and green triangles is:
According to the law of cosines, the cosine of δ can be seen from the figure:
Simplifying, δ is obtained as function of α and β:
The remaining angles of the pentagon can be found geometrically: The remaining angles of the orange and blue triangles are readily found by noting that two angles of an isosceles triangle are equal while all three angles sum to 180°. Then and the two remaining angles of the green triangle can be found from four equations stating that the sum of the angles of the pentagon is 540°, the sum of the angles of the green triangle is 180°, the angle is the sum of its three components, and the angle is the sum of its two components.
A cyclic pentagon is equiangular if and only if it has equal sides and thus is regular. Likewise, a tangential pentagon is equilateral if and only if it has equal angles and thus is regular.
Tiling
There are two infinite families of equilateral convex pentagons that tile the plane, one having two adjacent supplementary angles and the other having two non-adjacent supplementary angles. Some of those pentagons can tile in more than one way, and there is one sporadic example of an equilateral pentagon that can tile the plane but does not belong to either of those two families; its angles are roughly 89°16', 144°32.5', 70°55', 135°22', and 99°54.5', no two supplementary.
A two-dimensional mapping
Equilateral pentagons can intersect themselves either not at all, once, twice, or five times. The ones that don't intersect themselves are called simple, and they can be classified as either convex or concave. We here use the term "stellated" to refer to the ones that intersect themselves either twice or five times. We rule out, in this section, the equilateral pentagons that intersect themselves precisely once.
Given that we rule out the pentagons that intersect themselves once, we can plot the rest as a function of two variables in the two-dimensional plane. Each pair of values (α, β) maps to a single point of the plane and also maps to a single pentagon.
The periodicity of the values of α and β and the condition α ≥ β ≥ δ permit the size of the mapping to be limited. In the plane with coordinate axes α and β, the equation α = β is a line dividing the plane in two parts (south border shown in orange in the drawing). The equation δ = β as a curve divides the plane into different sections (north border shown in blue).
Both borders enclose a continuous region of the plane whose points map to unique equilateral pentagons. Points outside the region just map to repeated pentagons—that is, pentagons that when rotated or reflected can match others already described. Pentagons that map exactly onto those borders have a line of symmetry.
Inside the region of unique mappings there are three types of pentagons: stellated, concave and convex, separated by new borders.
Stellated
The stellated pentagons have sides intersected by others. A common example of this type of pentagon is the pentagram. A condition for a pentagon to be stellated, or self-intersecting, is to have 2α + β ≤ 180°. So, in the mapping, the line 2α + β = 180° (shown in orange at the north) is the border between the regions of stellated and non-stellated pentagons. Pentagons which map exactly to this border have a vertex touching another side.
Concave
The concave pentagons are non-stellated pentagons having at least one angle greater than 180°. The first angle which opens wider than 180° is γ, so the equation γ = 180° (border shown in green at right) is a curve which is the border of the regions of concave pentagons and others, called convex. Pentagons which map exactly to this border have at least two consecutive sides appearing as a double length side, which resembles a pentagon degenerated to a quadrilateral.
Convex
The convex pentagons have all of their five angles smaller than 180° and no sides intersecting others. A common example of this type of pentagon is the regular pentagon.

Trigger is the Martin N-20 nylon-string classical acoustic guitar used by country music singer-songwriter Willie Nelson. Early in their career, Nelson tested several guitars by different companies. After their Baldwin guitar was damaged in 1969, they purchased the Martin guitar, but retained the electrical components from the Baldwin guitar.
Nelson based their desired style on Django Reinhardt's playing and guitar sound. They opted to amplify the acoustic guitar, resulting in their signature sound.
Background
As Nelson was an RCA Records artist, guitar manufacturers would loan or gift them their instruments to test them. Earlier in their career, Nelson played instruments of the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, with models including the Telecaster, Jaguar, and Jazzmaster. Nelson later moved on to Gibson Guitars. In 1969, before a concert at Panamerican Ballroom near Houston, Texas, Baldwin Company gave Nelson the 800C Classical Acoustic-Electric Guitar model with a Prismatone pickup and an amplifier to test.
The Martin N-20
In 1969, after a concert at Floore's Country Store in Helotes, Texas, a drunk man stepped on Nelson's Baldwin, breaking it beyond playability. David Zettner and Jimmy Day, members of Nelson's band The Record Men, took the guitar to Shot Jackson, a luthier in Nashville, Tennessee. Jackson, who considered the damage irreparable, offered Nelson a Martin N-20 nylon-stringed classical guitar made out of Brazilian rosewood with a Sitka spruce top (serial number 242830). Nelson instructed Jackson, during a phone conversation, to move the pickup from the Baldwin to the Martin. The pickup allowed them to amplify their classical acoustic sound to perform in large dance halls, contributing to their signature style. Nelson bought the modified Martin N-20 unseen, for $750 (). Two decades later, they named it after Roy Rogers' horse "Trigger". When asked about the name, Nelson often replies: "Roy Rogers had a horse named Trigger. I figured, this is my horse!" Nelson desired approaching the playing style and sound of jazz musician Django Reinhardt.
Nelson first used Trigger during the studio recordings of My Own Peculiar Way the same year, but the sound of the guitar was overwhelmed by the dubbing of strings and brass instruments on the mix. The following year, Nelson saved Trigger from their burning ranch in Bandera, Texas. After Nelson's move to Austin, Texas and the revitalization of their music, Trigger defined their sound. The singer used Trigger in the recording of their acclaimed albums Shotgun Willie, Red Headed Stranger and Stardust.
Appearance
Over time, Nelson has worn a large hole above the bridge, nearly reaching the sound hole. While classical guitars are meant to be played with finger-style picking, Nelson's use of a flatpick, and constant strumming, caused the damage as the pick slowly scrapes away at the wood. Trigger's wear is so great that even the steel frets have been worn down from smooth ridges to wavey lines by the nylon strings over 10,000 shows of exclusive use.
Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, such as fellow musicians, lawyers and football coaches. The first signature on the guitar was Leon Russell's, who asked Nelson initially to sign their guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested them to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested that Russell also sign their guitar.
Maintenance
Luthier Mark Erlewine has been doing maintenance and repairs on Trigger since 1977, after meeting Nelson at a bar. The guitar goes to Erlewine once a year for an annual "check-up" in Austin, Texas.
Trigger is prepared for Nelson before each show by their guitar technician, "Tunin' Tom" Hawkins.
Legacy
In 1991, during their process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: "When Trigger goes, I'll quit". They asked their daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent got there, and bring it to them in Maui. Nelson's attorney, Joel Katz, then hid the guitar in their house until the singers' debt was paid in 1993.
In their book, The Tao of Willie: A Guide to Happiness in Your Heart, Nelson described the influence of the guitar in their style: "One of the secrets to my sound is almost beyond explanation. My battered old Martin guitar, Trigger, has the greatest tone I've ever heard from a guitar. ... If I picked up the finest guitar made this year and tried to play my solos exactly the way you heard them on the radio or even at last night's show, I'd always be a copy of myself and we'd all end up bored. But if I play an instrument that is now a part of me, and do it according to the way that feels right for me ... I'll always be an original".
In 2015, Rolling Stone Films presented a documentary, Mastering the Craft: Trigger, which depicts the story of the guitar. Directed by David Chamberlin and narrated by Woody Harrelson, the film features interviews with Nelson, their biographer Joe Nick Patoski, harmonicist Mickey Raphael, and singer Jerry Jeff Walker.
Due to Trigger's impact within the music industry, Martin Guitars produced the Willie Nelson Limited Edition N-20WN.

Sebastián "Sebas" Montoya Freydell (born 11 April 2005) is a Colombian-American racing driver who is currently competing for Prema Racing in the 2022 Formula Regional European Championship. and the 2022 FIA Formula 3 Championship for Campos Racing.  They are the son of Formula One race winner Juan Pablo Montoya.
Career
Karting career
Montoya started their competitive karting career in 2013, racing in the Rotax Micro Max class of the Florida Winter Tour when they were just eight years old. They proceeded to race in that series for the following four years, where they achieved the best result of fifth in 2016. Montoya then moved to Europe to compete in the CIK-FIA Karting European Championship in 2017. Montoya spent a total of three years in the European Karting scene, twice driving in the Karting World Championship and thrice in the European Championship. In their time in karts Montoya only won one championship at an international level; this being the Rok the Rio competition in 2018.
Formula 4
2020
In 2020 Montoya made their single-seater debut with Prema Powerteam, racing full-time in the Italian F4 Championship and competing in two rounds of the ADAC F4 Championship. Unfortunately for Montoya, they were unable to score any podiums throughout the year, and finished eleventh in their main campaign, behind their three teammates Gabriele Minì, Dino Beganovic and Gabriel Bortoleto.
2021
Montoya re-signed with Prema for the 2021 season, returning to the Italian and German F4 series. They would run a part-time campaign in the latter, finishing second thrice in the six races they competed in, putting them ninth in the standings, ahead of three full-time competitors. Montoya's Italian campaign would be just as fruitful: netting nine podiums but no wins, Montoya finished fourth at the end of the year, being narrowly beaten by teammate Kirill Smal due to a spin in safety car conditions at the final race of the season in Monza.
Formula Regional
At the start of 2022 Montoya made their debut in the Formula Regional Asian Championship with Mumbai Falcons India Racing. After scoring pole position for the first race, Montoya scored their first car racing win of their career in a lights-to-flag victory. Montoya was ultimately unable to finish the season, but ended the championship in 7th place with 92 points.
Montoya moved up to the 2022 Formula Regional European Championship with Prema Racing. Just before their weekend at Spa-Francorchamps, Montoya announced that they had started receiving backing and sponsorship from Red Bull, marking them as a Red Bull athlete.
FIA Formula 3 Championship
Due to Oliver Goethe's Euroformula Open commitments, Montoya replaced them and made their first F3 appearance in Zandvoort, driving for Campos Racing whilst Hunter Yeany is still injured. Following free practice in which they ended 17th, Montoya stated that "the car is a massive step" and "it's been quite good though." They qualified in a brilliant seventh place as a red flag thwarted their rivals attempts to improve their lap times. In a track where it is tough to pass, Montoya finished both races in eighth place, having to defend against title contender Jak Crawford. Additionally, they were the only one in the Campos team to score points during the weekend.
In late September, Montoya partook in the post-season test that year with Hitech Grand Prix at Jerez.
Endurance racing
Montoya took part in two races of the 2022 IMSA SportsCar Championship.
Personal life
Montoya's father is Juan Pablo Montoya, a seven-time Formula One Grand Prix winner and current IndyCar driver.

Morrison v. Amway Corp. 49 F. Supp. 2d 529 was a lawsuit concerning the enforcement of a contractual arbitration provision between the defendant Amway Corp. and the plaintiff their distributors.
Background
Amway distributors earn their income from commissions from their sales of Amway products. To become a distributor of Amway products, one must pay a fee and sign a standard distributorship agreement that is renewed annually. The agreement consist of Code of Ethics and Rules of Conduct, right to distribute Amway products, the right to receive sales commissions any products sold for a year. Business Support Materials (BSM) provide media and functions designed to motivate Amway distributors.
In June 1997, the distributors complained about the determination of profits from the sale of BSM materials. This led to Amway amending an arbitration program into the rules of conduct. On January 8, 1998, a group of distributors (the Morrison group) sued Amway in Texas State Court alleging a number of federal and state law claims. The amended arbitration agreement was included in the standard distribution agreement and mailed out to distributors for contract renewal. The case was moved to district court and was stayed pending arbitration on October 15, 1998. Shortly after the Morrison lawsuit, another group of distributors: the Halmonton group, filed a lawsuit with state law claims only on July 1, 1998. This lawsuit was joined by the Morrison group of distributors.
On May 18, 2001, the distributors requested an arbitration, and counterarguments were exchanged by the parties on June 14, 2001. Arbitrator Anne Gifford was selected from JAMS arbitration services provider for Amway, who completed an arbitration course conducted by Amway. The distributors then filed a motion for "Summary Disposition" contending there was no valid agreement prior to the arbitration program and the current arbitration program did not apply to their disputes because it was unconscionable. They also claimed that the arbitration was unfair because Amway selected and trained the arbitrator, and held exclusive powers to remove them. The motion was rejected by Gifford.
After discovery, on Jan. 13, 2005 Gifford ruled in favor of the distributors on all of Amway's claims, and in Amway's favor on all of the distributors' claims, resulting in $7 million to Amway offset by an award to distributors of $1 million. On January 27, 2005, the distributors moved in the district court to vacate the award alleging Gifford's partiality and “corruption” as well as the unenforceability of the arbitration agreement. This was followed by Amway and the other defendants confirming the award and entering judgment on it. The court sided with the defendant on September 15, 2005, denying the motion to vacate and confirmed the award. The court found that the arbitration clause was not rendered unconscionable because an automatic distributorship renewal form sent by the Amway compelled consent to the arbitration clause.
The distributors moved for rehearing on Sept. 21, 2005, which the district court denied without a hearing; the distributors appealed
Judgment
The distributors argued that the Amway has superior bargaining power and made this modification in the agreement unilaterally, making it a unconscionable contract of adhesion.
The appeals court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and held that the arbitration agreement was illusory, lacking in consideration, and unenforceable. The District court erred by compelling arbitration because there was no written arbitration policy at the time the lawsuit was filed. The clause "to comply with the Amway Sales and Marketing Plan, Code of Ethics, and Rules of Conduct as they are amended and published from time to time in official Amway literature," in Amway's Rules of Conduct was illusory, lacking in consideration, and unenforceable.

Marschlins Castle is a castle in the village of Igis of the municipality of Landquart of the Canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
Marschlins Castle was the childhood home of feminist Meta von Salis.
History
The castle was built in the 13th century, though there may have been 11th or 12th century castles on the site and local legend claims it dates back to the Carolingian era. However, the 13th century castle was probably built for the Bishop of Chur. The castle is built in the Savoyard style, a square castle with corner towers, one of which is enlarged to serve as the donjon. This style of castle is unique in Graubünden and how the design was imported is unknown. One theory for a Savoy connection is that between 1233 and 1237 the Bishop of Chur was Ulrich IV of Kyburg whose brother Hartmann IV was married to Margarethe of Savoy.
The castle was first mentioned on 12 May 1324 as the death place of the knight Jacob von Marmels. In 1336 the Bishop and Count Ulrich von Montfort were quarreling over the castle, which was decided by the courts in the Bishop's favor. However, in the following year they granted the castle as a fief to Duke Albert II of Austria. The Austrian duke granted it to several of their knights, until on 3 October 1354 it was granted to the Counts of Toggenburg in exchange for their support against Zürich and the Old Swiss Confederation. After the death of the last Count of Toggenburg, Frederick VII, in 1436 the fief passed back to the Austrians who granted it to the Brandis family to hold for the Bishop of Chur. In 1442 they used the castle as collateral for a loan from Heinrich von Sigberg. In 1460 the castle was partly destroyed in a fire. Because of the complex ownership (owned by the Bishop of Chur, granted as a fief to the Brandis family, collateral to the Sigberg family), a quarrel broke out between the Brandis and Sigberg families over the cost of repairs. A mediator from the Three Leagues determined that the Brandis family needed to repay the loan and that the repair costs would be shared equally.
In 1462 the Duke of Austria acquired the castle and estates from the Bishop of Chur and sold it to Ulrich von Brandis, who began rebuilding. In 1467 the duke expanded the estates attached to Marschlins by adding Malans, Untervaz and Valzeina. In 1498 the Brandis family began trying to sell the castle and estates, but the outbreak of the Swabian War in the following year broke the deal. After the war, in 1509, they pawned the castle to Ulrich Goeldin and in 1518 the Gugelberg family bought it outright. Around 1600 the moat was drained.
In 1633 the rather dilapidated structure was acquired by Ulysses von Salis, a member of the Salis-Soglio family, who adopted the name Salis-Marschlins. They had made their fortune as a French French Maréchal de camp. Two years later they began renovating the castle and turned it from a more military fortification into an elegant house with a french garden. In 1771 the bell tower on the chapel was added. From 1771 until 1777 the castle became a philanthropinist school. Later, it was a tobacco factory and a silk spinning mill. After the French invasion of Switzerland the castle became an army camp. A total of about 10,000 soldiers and 3,000 horse passed through the castle between March 1799 and December 1800.
In 1905 the Salis family had the castle rebuilt under the guidance of the architect Eugen Probst. Probst, the controversial founder of the Schweizerischer Burgenverein, made little effort to preserve the historic structures or preserve the medieval appearance of Marschlins. An additional floor was added to the tower and many new windows were added. After the death of Meta von Salis-Marschlins, the last offspring of their branch, the castle was inherited by the Maienfeld branch of the Salis family who sold it in 1934. Today the castle is still privately owned. Since 2020 it is put up for sale, together with its agricultural estate.
Castle site
The castle is located about north-east of Igis village, on a flat plain but about from a steep cliff. The castle is surrounded by two moats which were filled with water during the Middle Ages. Originally the moats were spanned with a drawbridge, which was replaced with a stone bridge in the 17th century. It is rectangular and about in size. Each corner has a round tower with the in diameter south tower being the largest and main tower. The other three towers are in diameter. The oldest residence building in the castle is on the north side. The current triumphal arch like gate is in the center of the western wall, but was originally further south. In the courtyard is a cannon from the Salis regiment from 1676.
There are three highly decorated, 17th century furnished rooms in the castle. The Marschallstübli was built around 1633 and features richly carved paneling with inlaid marquetry and a carved wooden coffered ceiling. The cocklestove was built in 1638 by the Pfau workshop and the cabinets decorated with the alliance arms of Heinrich Hirzel-Yolanda von Salis are from 1674. The Offiziersstube was completed in 1638 and is paneled in stone pine. The coffered ceiling is decorated with a carved Salis coat of arms. A Steckborn oven from the first half of the 18th century warmed the room. The third room, the Goldene Stübli in the north-east tower was completed around 1670. The carved paneling is painted with hunting scenes. The coffered roof is decorated with 43 constellations and the four winds. The room is decorated with a collection of gothic sculptures. The chapel was built in the main tower in 1771. The interior is decorated with paintings of the Four Evangelists from the mid-17th century and with stained glass from the same era.

Moussa Marega (born 14 April 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as a second striker for Saudi Professional League club Al Hilal. Born in France, they represent the Mali national team.
They began their career in France, playing no higher than the Championnat National. After one year with Espérance in Tunisia, they moved to Marítimo of the Primeira Liga in 2015. Shortly afterwards, they signed for Porto. After spending 2016–17 on loan at Vitória de Guimarães, they became a regular in the Porto side and won two league titles in four years. In 2021, they signed with Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, where they won the AFC Champions League in their first year.
Marega made their international debut for Mali in 2015, and was part of their squad at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2017 and 2019.
Club career
Early career
Born in Les Ulis, Essonne, to Malian parents, Marega began their career at Évry FC, before moving to Vendée Poiré-sur-Vie Football of the Championnat National in 2012, and fellow league team Amiens a year later. They spent the second half of 2014 in ES Tunis, but could not make a single appearance due to bureaucratic problems.
They subsequently moved to Marítimo in Portugal's Primeira Liga in January 2015. In November 2015, they were sent off in a 1–0 loss at Amarante with two yellow cards and then gestured at the bench; they were suspended from training with the club as a result.
Porto
Both Marega and Marítimo goalkeeper José Sá were on the cusp of a move to Sporting CP in January 2016, but FC Porto signed the pair on contracts lasting to 2020; Marega's buyout clause was set at €40 million. They made 13 appearances in their first campaign at the Estádio do Dragão – mostly as a substitute – and scored once in a 2–0 home win over Gil Vicente in the Taça da Liga on 2 March. Their early poor performances drew vocal criticism from some Porto fans, and they took training from a friend on how to become mentally resilient.
On 20 July 2016, Marega was loaned to Vitória de Guimarães for the upcoming season. They made their debut a month later in a 2–0 win against their former team, Marítimo, scoring the second goal, and on 30 October, they scored all three goals in a 3–0 win against Rio Ave to reach 10 goals from 8 games. On 4 November, they received a straight red card in the first half-hour of a 2–1 home win over Nacional for striking Nuno Sequeira, receiving a three-match ban.
On their return to Porto, Marega scored twice in the opening game of the 2017–18 season, a 4–0 home win over Estoril, as a first-half substitute for Tiquinho. They were part of a three-pronged attack made of African players, alongside the Cameroonian Vincent Aboubakar and the Algerian Yacine Brahimi.
They scored 14 league goals in 14 starts, and reportedly began to attract the interest of Premier League sides Manchester United and Chelsea in January 2018. Porto won the league for the first time in five years and Marega was their top scorer (third overall behind Jonas and Bas Dost) with 22 goals.
In November 2018, Marega was awarded the Dragão de Ouro (Golden Dragon) as Porto's best player of the calendar year. Having not previously scored in a European match, Marega scored a goal in six consecutive appearances in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, starting with a goal in 1–0 win over Galatasaray, and ending with one in a 3–1 win over Roma, that put Porto in the quarter-finals for the first time in four years.
On 16 February 2020, after scoring the winning goal on their return to Vitória, Marega gave the middle finger to the home fans who had been racially abusing him. The insults continued after this incident and in response, they walked out of the game, and was subsequently substituted. Their reaction to the abuse was praised by the Portuguese press, with A Bola newspaper giving Marega a perfect 10 rating in its player ratings. They scored in a 2–0 home win over Sporting on 15 July that year, as their team won the title with two games left to play. On 17 February 2021, they scored a goal in a 2–1 win over Juventus in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League round of 16.
Al-Hilal
On 10 May 2021, Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal announced the signing of Marega on a three-year contract as a free transfer, with a salary of €5 million per year. They won the AFC Champions League in their first year, with a goal in the semi-final 2–1 win at compatriots Al Nassr, followed by one in the 2–0 final victory over South Korea's Pohang Steelers.
International career
Marega made their debut for the Mali national team on 25 March 2015, in a friendly against Gabon in Beauvais, France; they started in the 4–3 defeat. On 4 September 2016, they scored their first international goal in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification game against Benin, helping towards a 5–2 win at the Stade du 26 Mars.
In January 2017, they were called up for Mali's squad at the final tournament in Gabon. In the Eagles' opening game against Egypt in Port-Gentil, they were named man of the match in a goalless draw. They also started the other two games of the group stage elimination.
Marega was also called up for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. They scored in their opening game, a 4–1 win over Mauritania, as they made the last 16. Having not played since the 2019 edition, Marega was not called up for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon.
Personal life
Marega is a practising Muslim and moved to Saudi for reasons of faith. They became father to a son in 2017.

The broccoli mandate, also known as the broccoli test, broccoli argument, broccoli hypothetical or broccoli horrible, was an argument used by those opposed to healthcare reform in the United States proposed by Barack Obama, who was then the President of the United States.
Use in 2012 Supreme Court summation
The so-called broccoli mandate was referenced by the conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in 2012, in their summation against healthcare reform. On March 27 of that year, Justice Scalia asked Donald B. Verrilli Jr., a lawyer for the Obama administration, to defend the individual shared responsibility provision (commonly called the individual mandate) of the ACA, saying to Verrilli:
Opponents of reform – such as Justice Scalia – say that it should not be compulsory for American people to purchase health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) just because it is beneficial, otherwise, an enforcement body could similarly mandate Americans to buy broccoli because of its benefits to human health, which they say is an example of over-reaching authority. It has been described as a form of the slippery slope and reductio ad absurdum arguments.
Supporters of the individual mandate have questioned this analogy. For example, Verrilli told Justice Scalia that the health care market is unique and:

The Battle of Taipale was a series of battles fought during the Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union from 6 to 27 December 1939. The battles were part of a Soviet campaign to penetrate the Finnish Mannerheim Line in the Karelian Isthmus region to open a route into southern Finland. Despite their numerical superiority, the Soviet forces were unable to break through the Finnish defences.
Prelude: 30 November – 6 December
On 30 November, Soviet forces crossed the Finnish border and bombarded civilian targets from the air. The Karelian Isthmus was split into two military sectors by both belligerents: one on the side of Lake Ladoga and the other on the side of the Gulf of Finland. In the Ladoga sector, the Soviet commanding officer was Vladimir Grendahl and on the Finnish side, Erik Heinrichs. On 3 December, Grendahl received orders to make a breakthrough in their sector, as the defenders in the other sector were more numerous and offered fiercer resistance. The former objective of reaching Viipuri on the Gulf side of the Karelian Isthmus became a secondary priority. The attack began on 6 December, when the Finns had retreated to the Mannerheim Line.
The battle: 6–27 December
The Battle of Taipale began on 6 December, started when the Soviet 49th and 150th Rifle Divisions of the 7th Army tried to cross the Taipale River at three locations. The terrain was flat farmland, so the Soviets had no cover, and the Finnish 10th Division's accurate artillery inflicted heavy losses. However, due to the sheer size of the Soviet forces, the attackers managed to establish a bridgehead over the river. The Finns inflicted such severe casualties that some units (even as large as a regiment) had to be withdrawn. In the following days, the Finns repelled more assaults and inflicted even more casualties, causing the collapse of many Soviet units. Despite this, however, they were not strong enough to stop the Soviet advance, and soon the bridgehead was gradually enlarged, securing ground for the reinforcements that were on the way (the 39th Armoured Brigade). By 12 December, the bridgehead was large enough to support an advance into the Taipale sector.

Lewis Ezra Hicks (March 10, 1839 – November 17, 1921) was an American geologist, zoologist and college administrator.
Career
Hicks was born in Kalida, Ohio, to Ezra and Julia (Lincoln) Hicks. During the American Civil War they were Lieutenant Colonel in the 69th Ohio Infantry. They were educated at Denison University and graduated with an A. B. in 1868. They attended Harvard University where they pursued work in geology and zoology. They were a student of Louis Agassiz. They were Professor of Natural Science at Denison University (1870-1884) and professor of geology at University of Nebraska (1884-1891). They were a fellow and member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a founding member of the Geological Society of America.
They were an editor for the journal American Geologist. In 1894, Hicks was appointed a missionary for the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. Similar to Asa Gray, they believed that Darwin's theory of evolution and theism were compatible.
From 1905 to 1911 they were president of Rangoon Baptist College in Burma. They died in Georgia, November 17, 1921.
Critique of design arguments
Hicks wrote a criticism of intelligent design arguments in 1883. Professor of Science Bruce H. Weber has noted that Hicks "warned of the ambiguity of conflating design seen as created contrivances with intent or purpose resulting from the action of natural law. They saw defenders of design logically and unjustifiably gliding from the first usage to the second in many of their arguments. For this reason alone, they thought design arguments should be banished."

The Brigham City Utah Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Brigham City, Utah. The temple was announced by church president Thomas S. Monson on October 3, 2009, during the church's general conference. The temple was announced concurrently with those to be constructed in Concepción, Chile, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Fortaleza, Brazil and Sapporo, Japan; at the time, the announcement brought the total number of temples worldwide to 151 (including those under construction and announced). It is the fourteenth temple of the LDS Church completed in Utah.
The temple is located on the property where the Central Elementary School once stood at 250 South Main Street in Brigham City, across from the historic tabernacle.
A groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 31, 2010, and was conducted by Boyd K. Packer, president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and a native of Brigham City.
On the morning of June 28, 2011, the western spire was installed. The angel Moroni statue was installed on the eastern tower on July 12, 2011. The installation was delayed for almost two hours due to weather problems.
A public open house was held from August 18 through September 15, 2012, excluding Sundays and Saturdays. The temple was formally dedicated in three sessions on September 23, 2012, by Packer. The dedicatory sessions were broadcast to congregations of the church within Utah. In conjunction with the dedication of the temple, there was a cultural celebration featuring music and dance on September 22.

Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo, GCMG, GCSK, QC, (born Vīracāmi Riṅkāṭu; 20 October 1920 – 9 September 2000) was a Mauritian politician, minister, the sixth and last governor-general of Mauritius from 1986 to 1992, and then the first president of Mauritius from March to June 1992.

The Bréguet Bre.4, also known variously as the Type IV and BUM, was a French biplane bomber of World War I. A fighter version of it was also produced as the BUC and BLC; some of these saw service with the British Royal Navy, which called them 'the Bréguet 'de Chasse.
Design and development
The Bre.4 was developed during 1914 when French military planners began to express a preference for pusher- over tractor-configured aircraft, leading Bréguet Aviation to cease further development of its original Type IV design and pursue military contracts with an aircraft of the preferred layout. The Type IV was a two-bay, equal-span, unstaggered biplane that seated the pilot and observer in tandem open cockpits in a nacelle that also carried the pusher engine at its rear, and the tricycle undercarriage.
As the prototype neared completion, the Bréguet factory at La Brayelle, Douai was threatened by the advancing German Army, and the machine and its builders were evacuated to Villacoublay where construction and testing were completed. At this point, André and Édouard Michelin approached the French government with an offer to sponsor the construction of 100 bombers for the French Army, and were awarded a licence for the Bréguet design. This was put into production as the BUM (B for pusher-driven, U for Canton-Unné-powered, M for Michelin). A later revised version, the BLM, was the definitive Renault-powered version.
Soon after the BUM entered service, the French Army requested that an escort fighter version be developed to protect the bombers from interception. Bréguet responded with a lightened design armed with a 37 mm (1.46 in) Hotchkiss cannon, intended to pick off enemy fighters before they closed to within range of their machine guns. This entered production as the BUC (C for chasse, or pursuit) in its original Canton-Unné powered version and BLC in its Renault version.
Operational history
French service
Few of the BUC and BLC escort fighters were built, as their performance and utility were discovered to be lacking, and the doctrine of the cannon-armed escort fighter was soon abandoned in favour of countering fighters with other similar fighters.
Royal Naval Air Service
Bréguet built 17 BUC/BLCs for the British Royal Navy's Royal Naval Air Service using British Sunbeam Mohawk engines. The Royal Navy called them the Bréguet de Chasse. They served alongside Caudron G.4s with No. 5 Wing RNAS – the Royal Navys first air unit specifically trained for long-range bombing – in Belgium from April to June 1916.

Commelinaceae is a family of flowering plants. In less formal contexts, the group is referred to as the dayflower family or spiderwort family. It is one of five families in the order Commelinales and by far the largest of these with about 731 known species in 41 genera. Well known genera include Commelina (dayflowers) and Tradescantia (spiderworts). The family is diverse in both the Old World tropics and the New World tropics, with some genera present in both. The variation in morphology, especially that of the flower and inflorescence, is considered to be exceptionally high amongst the angiosperms.
The family has always been recognized by most taxonomists. The APG III system of 2009 (unchanged from the APG system of 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Commelinales in the clade commelinids in the monocots. The family counts several hundred species of herbaceous plants. Many are cultivated as ornamentals. The stems of these plants are generally well-developed, and often swollen at the nodes. Flowers are often short-lived, lasting for a day or less.
The flowers of Commelinaceae are ephemeral, lack nectar, and offer only pollen as a reward to their pollinators. Most species are hermaphroditic, meaning each flower contains male and female organs, or andromonoecious, meaning that both bisexual and male flowers occur on the same plant. Floral dimorphism may be accompanied by variable pedicel length, filament length and/or curvature, or stamen number and/or position. Species tend to have specific flowering seasons, though local environmental factors tend to effect exact timing, sometimes considerably. Species tend to flower at a specific time of day as well, with these periods being well defined enough to presumably isolate different species reproductively. Furthermore, some species exhibit differential opening times for male and bisexual flowers. Commelinaceae flowers tend to deceive pollinators by appearing to offer a larger reward than is actually present. This is accomplished with various adaptations such as yellow hairs or broad anther connectives that mimic pollen, or staminodes that lack pollen but appear like fertile stamens.
Description
Plants in the Commelinaceae are usually perennials, but a smaller number of species are annuals. They are always terrestrial except for plants in the genus Cochliostema, which are epiphytes. Plants typically have an erect or scrambling but ascending habit, often spreading by rooting at the nodes or by stolons. Some have rhizomes, and the genera Streptolirion, Aetheolirion, and some species of Spatholirion are climbers. The roots are either fibrous or form tubers.
Leaves form sheaths at their bases that surround the stem, much like the leaves of grasses, except that the sheaths are closed and do not have a ligule. The leaves alternate up the stem and may be two-ranked or spirally arranged. The leaf blades are simple and entire (that is, they lack any teeth or lobes), they sometimes narrow at the base, and they are often succulent. The way in which the leaves typically unfurl from bud is a distinctive feature of the family: it is termed involute, and means that the margins at the leaf base are rolled in when they first emerge. However, some groups are supervolute or convolute.
The inflorescences occur either as a terminal shoot at the top of the plant, or as terminal and axillary shoots arising from lower nodes, or rarely as only axillary shoots that pierce through the leaf sheath such as in Coleotrype and Amischotolype. The inflorescence is classed as a thyrse, and each subunit is made up of cincinni; this basically means that flowers are grouped in scorpion's tail-like clusters along a central axis, although this basic ground plan can become highly modified or reduced. Inflorescences or their subunit are sometimes enclosed in a leaf-like bract often called a spathe.
Flowers can have either one or many planes of symmetry; that is either zygomorphic or actinomorphic. They remain open for only a few hours after opening, after which they deliquesce. The flowers are usually all bisexual (hermaphrodite), but some species have both male and bisexual flowers (andromonoecious), the single species Callisia repens has bisexual and female flowers (gynomonoecious), and some have bisexual, male, and female flowers (polygamomonoecious). nectaries are not found in any species within the family. There are always three sepals, although they may be equal or unequal, unfused or basally fused, petal-like or green. Likewise there are always three petals, but these may be equal or in two forms, free or basally fused, white or coloured. The petals are sometimes clawed, meaning they narrow to stalk at the base where they attach to the rest of the flower. There are almost always six stamens in two whorls, but these occur in a myriad of arrangements and forms. They may be all fertile and equal or unequal, but in many genera two to four are staminodes (i.e. infertile, non-pollen producing stamens). Staminodes can alternate with the fertile stamens or they can all occur in the upper or lower hemisphere of the flower. The stalks of the stamens are bearded in many genera, although in some of these only some are bearded while others are hairless. Sometimes one to three stamens are absent altogether. Pollen is usually released from slits that open on the sides of the anthers from top to bottom, but some species have pores that open at the tips.
Phylogeny
The Commelinaceae is a well supported monophyletic group according to the analysis of Burns et al. (2011). The following is a phylogeny, or evolutionary tree, of most of the genera in Commelinaceae based on DNA sequences from the plastid gene rbcL
All clades shown have 80% bootstrap support or better.

In computing, the User Programmatic Interface (UPI), also known as the User Program Interface, consists of a set of C-language software APIs which provide the lowest-level API-based interface to the Oracle database.
Overview
UPI offers a procedural API for not only performing certain database administration tasks (such as system startup and shutdown), but also for using PL/SQL or SQL to query, access, and manipulate data. The UPI library, an undocumented API used internally by Oracle, deals directly with the Two-Task Common (TTC)
aspect of the Oracle Client software stack.
UPI-based applications
Several Oracle database applications depend on UPI, including:
Oracle Forms
SQL*Plus (also uses OCI)
Oracle Corporation's data-import and -export (IMP/EXP) utilities

Wheelers Bay is a small bay on the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight, England. It lies to the east of Ventnor. It faces south-east towards the English Channel, its shoreline is in length. A section of the bay, to the side of the slipway, is used as dry-storage for boats; in recent years this has been targeted by thieves. The bay is home to an open-air café known as The Seapot.
The bay is accessed by a concrete slope from the road above the bay or by walking along the seawall either from Ventnor or Horseshoe Bay. The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs the length of the bay along the seawall.
History
In the 19th century, the beaches of Wheelers Bay and Horseshoe Bay were used for the unloading of provisions, particularly coal. Boats would beach at high tide and the cargo off-loaded onto horse-drawn carts. The boats would then be floated off again at the next high tide. The bay is famous for the looting of shipwrecks, where sometimes locals would kill survivors to claim the cargo, many families in the area made their fortunes this way.
In the early 1990s, after a study by the former Department of Environment, the existing sea defences were improved at a cost of £1.6 million, to protect the cliff from erosion. This includes a revetment with an outer layer of rocks and 23,000 tonnes of chalk fill-material.

"Miagete goran yoru no hoshi wo" (見上げてごらん夜の星を "Look up at the stars in the night") is a 1963 hit song performed by a Japanese singer Kyu Sakamoto. It was written by lyricist Rokusuke Ei and composer Taku Izumi. Izumi won the Japan Record Award. The song was originally written for a musical of the same title in 1960.
This song was covered by many singers, including BEGIN (as an end theme for the anime Futatsu no Spica) and Ken Hirai.
The song, among other cheerful songs of Kyu Sakamoto, was often heard in Japan after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. This included a series of versions by 71 actors and singers (among which was Tommy Lee Jones), for Suntory beverage company commercials, coupled with the song "Ue o Muite Arukō". Shikao Suga also covered the song for charity.
The lyrics start as follows:
見上げてごらん夜の星を miagete goran yoru no hoshi wo (Look up at the stars in the sky)
小さな星の 小さな光りが chiisana hoshi no, chiisana hikari ga (The small light from a small star)
ささやかな幸せを 歌ってるsasayaka na shiawase wo utatteru (Is singing of a small happiness)

The Gibraltar Constitution Order 2006 was taken to a referendum in Gibraltar on 30 November 2006. A coalition of groups opposing the proposal held that a majority of 60% should be required to give effect to a new Constitution, quoting other instances, but the political parties held that the result should be decided by a simple majority in favour of the new constitution. The constitution was approved by 60% of the votes anyway.
It was given effect by an Order in Council on 14 December 2006 and it came into force on 2 January 2007. According to the British government, it aimed to provide a modern and mature relationship that is not based on colonialism between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.
Origin
In 1999, the Government of the United Kingdom invited British Dependent Territories to provide proposals for constitutional reform. A cross-party committee of the Gibraltar House of Assembly was set up to consult with interested parties and in January 2002 produced a report, which was subsequently debated and negotiated with the United Kingdom. The proposals for the reform were accepted by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office in March 2006 and then were unanimously approved in the House of Assembly in October.
Publication procedure
Once promulgated by the Queen-in-Council, the Constitution Order was published as a set of documents:
The Despatch, the letter under cover of which the Foreign Secretary sent the Constitution order to the Governor of Gibraltar.
The Order in Council, which contained the preamble as main content. It also included several annexes.
The Annexes to the Order in Council. Annex No 1 is the text of the Constitution itself; Annex No 2 contains the transitional and other provisions.
Contents
The proposed constitution had been negotiated with the British Government by a delegation representing Gibraltar, comprising the Government, the Opposition and others. The text of the proposed new Constitution had been welcomed by the House of Assembly in a motion passed unanimously with the support of both sides of the House.
Among changes introduced by the new constitution were:
Renaming the House of Assembly to the Gibraltar Parliament.
Renaming "Members of the House of Assembly" to "Members of Parliament" (MPs).
Removal of the two remaining un-elected members of the House of Assembly.
Increasing the number of elected representatives from 15 to 17, with the parliament able to legislate to increase this number.
Decreasing the Governor's powers, and transferring some of these to elected officials.
Modernisation of the relationship between Gibraltar and the UK, without affecting the issue of sovereignty.
A bill of "fundamental rights and freedoms" enshrined in the constitution.
Referendum
A referendum on the proposed new constitution order was held on 30 November 2006. The motion proposed and approved was:
The possible answers were "Yes" and "No".
Response
On colonialism and modernisation of political institutions
Answering the complaints of Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos, Jack Straw stated:
In the foreword of an explanatory leaflet issued by the Government of Gibraltar for the proposed new constitution, Chief Minister Peter Caruana said that he:
They further added:
Caruana also stated:
On independence
At the same time, the UK government, while fully supporting the right of self-determination for Gibraltarians, excluded the possibility of independence for Gibraltar, referring to the Treaty of Utrecht:
However, the UK government acknowledged that Gibraltar "does not share the view that this constraint exists and that their acceptance of this Constitution is on that basis".
Criticisms
In spite of the unanimous support from all the political parties represented in the House of Assembly, there was a significant "No" movement. The reasons were diverse, but mainly related to two aspects: while some electors could have felt that the commitment to retaining British sovereignty was not sufficiently secure, other could have believed that the new constitution were not advanced enough in allowing the exercise of the right to self-determination. The minority rights pressure group Equality Rights GGR, have called it "gravely deficient" and a "missed opportunity", for failing to fully incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Self Determination for Gibraltar Group also criticised the constitution and campaigned for a No vote in the constitutional referendum. They said in a press release that the new constitution "is not the act of self-determination which will decolonise us" and that it "is as colonial as its 1964 and 1969 predecessors."
Joe Bossano, Leader of the Opposition, criticised the failure to phrase the preamble in a way that supported the maximum possible level of self-government.
Result
Turnout was 60.4%, the lowest at a general election or referendum for 25 years. This was much lower than the 87.9% achieved for the 2002 referendum on shared sovereignty but comparable to the 58% for the election for the European Parliament. 60.24% of votes cast were for the order, 37.75% of votes were against.

The Savage House and Garden is a historic home and garden at 3237 Garden Drive in the Fountain City community of Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. Built around 1917 and designed in the Bungalow/Craftsman style, the house and its garden are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Arthur Savage (1872–1946), an immigrant from Leamington Spa, England, designed the house and garden during World War I. Along with their older brother, W. L. Savage, Arthur Savage made a small fortune in the early 1900s by manufacturing industrial equipment. Savage was president of the Ty-Sa-Man company, once located in what is now the World's Fair Park, which specialized in the manufacturing of marble-cutting equipment.
Savage loved rock gardens, and established several in East Tennessee, including one in Lake City, along with the one in Fountain City. The Fountain City garden was inspired by Japanese garden designs, which had become popular through the early twentieth century Art Nouveau movement. Work on the garden began around 1917, and was completed sometime during following decade.
In 1937, the Savage Garden was damaged by a tornado, and remained in a state of disrepair for several years. In 1986, the Savage family sold the garden to Bill Dohm and Patty Cooper. Dohm and Cooper have since renovated the garden and restored its fountain. Plant species found in the garden include Japanese Umbrella Pine, Chinese Pistache, Jack-in-the-Pulpit, and Dwarf Crested Iris.

Baba Balababa oghlu Aliyev (, March 22, 1915 — March 27, 1991) was an Azerbaijani painter, People's Artist of the Azerbaijan SSR, Chairman of the Union of Artists of Azerbaijan.
Biography
Baba Aliyev was born on March 22, 1915 in Zira settlement. They graduated from the Azerbaijan State Art School in 1937, and in 1941 from the Moscow State Art Institute named after Surikov.
Baba Aliyev had been a member of the CPSU since 1945. They served as chairperson of the Union of Artists of Azerbaijan and was a member of the Artists' Union of the USSR.
The artist taught at the Azerbaijan State Art School named after Azim Azimzade in 1946-1960. Baba Aliyev died on March 27, 1991 in Baku.
Career
Portraits and still lifes are the main genres in the artist's work. They started art in the years of the Great Patriotic War, and the artistic images of frontline fighters have a special place in their work during these years. Baba Aliyev's "Heroism of Pilot Mazahir Abbasov" (1947), portraits of Commissar Novruz Aslanov and Colonel S. Suprun are considered as such. Their portrait "Suprun, Hero of the Soviet Union" was displayed at the Great Patriotic War exhibition in Tbilisi in 1942.
In the post-war years, Baba Aliyev, like other artists, began to describe generalized artistic images of working people. In 1951, together with Abdul Khalig and A. Zarubin, they worked on a large panel entitled "Cotton Delivery to the State" dedicated to the work of cotton growers. This work was exhibited at the All-Union Exhibition in 1951. The artist tried to show the nature of the work of oil workers in such works as "Before the turn" (1959), "Rest of oil workers" (1961), "New force" (1963).
Baba Aliyev was the author of a number of portraits such as "Portrait of a Girl" (1957), "Portrait of a collective farmer F. Abdullayeva" (1962), "Nurse" (1983), "Jovdat Hajiyev" (1986), "Moonlit Night" (1962), "Peaches" (1964), "Evening in Goygol" (1978) and other landscapes and still lifes.
In the 1960s, the artist preferred a strict style. Their works of this kind include "Rest of the Oil Workers" (1961) and "Rest of the Tankers" (1965).
Memorial
According to the order of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic "On perpetuation of the memory of Baba Aliyev" dated November 28, 2005, a street named after the artist was given in Zira settlement of Baku, a memorial plaque was placed at III Magomayev sidestreet, 3.
An exhibition dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Baba Aliyev opened at the National Art Museum of Azerbaijan on June 7, 2016.

David "Dave" Kapoor (born November 17, 1975) is an Indian-American writer and former professional wrestling manager, better known by their ring name, Ranjin Singh.  They are best known for their time in WWE, where they worked on the writing team as the senior vice president of creative and as the manager, translator, and storyline brother of The Great Khali.
Professional wrestling career
World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE
In 2007, Kapoor began their career with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the heel manager and translator for The Great Khali under the ring name Ranjin Singh. On the December 21 episode of SmackDown!, Singh competed in their first match, teaming with Khali in a losing effort against Finlay and Hornswoggle. On the January 11, 2008 episode of SmackDown!, Singh challenged Hornswoggle to an Arm wrestling contest in a losing effort, after Finlay shocked Singh's hand with the glove that Hornswoggle wore during the contest. Later in 2008, Khali and Singh turned face, with the duo hosting a segment called "Khali Kiss Cam".
On the April 29, 2011 episode of SmackDown, Khali and Singh were greeted by the debuting Jinder Mahal. The following week on SmackDown, Mahal, unimpressed with how Khali and Singh were acting, confronted Singh about them mismanaging Khali. On the May 27 episode of SmackDown, after Khali was defeated by Kane, Mahal shoved Singh, with Khali then attacking Singh, ending their partnership. On the July 1 episode of SmackDown, Singh revealed that Khali joined with Mahal because they are brothers-in-law (kayfabe), with Mahal threatening to divorce Khali's sister if Khali didn't do as they said, which would bring Khali's family back into poverty. Singh was absent from television for over 2 and a half years, but managed Khali again for one night only in January 2014.
Kapoor worked for WWE behind the scenes becoming the senior vice president of the creative team in 2019. They were let go from WWE on January 5, 2022, ending their 14-year tenure there.

Eleanor Shipley Duckett (7 November 1880, Bridgwater, Somerset, England – 23 November 1976) was an English-born philologist and medieval historian who spent most of their career in the United States. For thirty years, they taught at Smith College (Northampton, Massachusetts). Duckett published a number of books with University of Michigan Press, mainly on European history, religious history, and saints, and was a reviewer for The New York Times Book Review. Initially, Duckett was known for writing accessible historical books on the Middle Ages; later, they acquired a reputation as an authority on early medieval saints. A devout Episcopalian, Duckett was the lifelong companion of novelist Mary Ellen Chase.
Biography
Encouraged by their father to study the classical texts, Duckett worked through their preparatory education in order to attend university. They received their BA (1903) and MA (1904), as well as a degree in pedagogy (1905), from the University of London. They used these degrees to teach the classics at Sutton High School in Surrey until 1907, but then left to resume their own education with a scholarship to Girton College, the first women's college at Cambridge University. In 1911 they passed the Classical Tripos examination, and left Europe on another scholarship for PhD work at Bryn Mawr College, where they received their doctorate in 1914. In part, their move toward the United States was motivated by the lack of respect for women scholars in England. In 1964 they recalled how at Cambridge they showed the manuscript of their first book to "an eminent scholar," who asked her, "Do you want me to judge it on its own merits or as the work of a woman?"
In 1914, Duckett attained a position at Western College for Women in Ohio, and in 1916 began teaching Latin at Smith College, after 1928 as a full professor, where they would remain the rest of their career. In 1926, they met novelist Mary Ellen Chase, who was from Blue Hill, Maine. They lived together until Chase's death in 1973, and were honored by having adjoining halls named for them on the Smith College campus. In 1928 they were named the John M. Greene Professor of Classical Languages and Literature. They retired in 1949 and was named professor emeritus. In 1952, they finally received their doctorate from Girton College on the basis of their four published books on early medieval history. However, they never received a degree for their initial studies at Cambridge. Women were not awarded either full degrees or the benefits of membership at Cambridge until 1948.
After retirement in 1949, Duckett remained an active voice in the history of the Early Middle Ages, and retained a prominent position on campus as an emeritus professor. They kept their office in Neilson Library at Smith, and also spent extended periods researching and lecturing at Cambridge. They traveled the world to lecture, research, and receive honors for their work. Several of their most important publications were written after retirement. They were also very active in St. John's Episcopal Church in Northampton. They lectured there on the saints and the Church Councils, translated hymns, and organized readings of the Epistles.
Duckett continued to write and travel, mostly to Cambridge and Maine, where they and Chase stayed on the coast at a summer house called Windswept, a name which Chase was to use for one of their most popular novels. In 1973, after Chase died, Duckett lost the house in Northampton where they and Chase had lived since the 1920s and entered a nursing home. They died in 1976, and is buried next to Chase, near Windswept.
Eleanor Duckett's academic legacy is their body of work—seventeen full-length volumes, as well as many contributions to scholarly journals and two major encyclopedias. Another legacy stands on the grounds of Smith College. Duckett House is one of two residence buildings added to the campus in 1968. The second building, Chase House, adjoins Duckett, and as its companion honors the contributions of both women to the history of the institution.
Publications and research interests
Duckett began their career as a Latin teacher and philologist, but in the 1920s moved steadily toward the Middle Ages. At this time also, their writing style began to change – possibly under the influence of Chase – toward a more active, accessible, and engaging style, "with considerable wit and sympathetic insight into character." In 1938, they published Gateway to the Middle Ages, which proved an accessible and popular book and established their reputation as a writer for a general audience. Finding more and more popular and scholarly recognition, they continued to cultivate their acquaintance with the scholarly authorities of their time, aided also by their position as a reviewer for The New York Times Book Review.
Duckett received a number of academic honors and awards. From 1926 to 1928 they held the Ottilie Hancock fellowship at Girton College. They accepted honorary degrees from the University of London (1920), Smith College (1949) and St. Dunstan's University (1969). The Pen & Brush Club, an organization devoted to the arts, celebrated their Anglo-Saxon Saints and Scholars as the most distinguished work of non-fiction of 1947. They also obtained an honorary membership in Phi Beta Kappa (1954), an honorary fellowship at Girton College (1958), and two Sophia Smith Fellowships for continuing research by Smith College emeriti (1963 and 1966). In 1964 they gave the Katharine Asher Engel Memorial Lecture at Smith, which was published the following year as Women and Their Letters in the Early Middle Ages.

Brother Michael J. McGinniss, F.S.C., Ph.D., a De La Salle Christian Brother, was the 28th president of La Salle University in Philadelphia, U.S. McGinniss became president on July 1, 1999. They had been a member of La Salle University's Religion department and was president of Christian Brothers University in Memphis, Tennessee from 1994 to 1999.
Early life
A native Philadelphian, McGinniss joined the De La Salle Christian Brothers in 1965 and graduated maxima cum laude from La Salle University in 1970 with a BA degree in English. They obtained their master's degree and Ph.D. in Theology from the University of Notre Dame.
From 1970 to 1974, they were a member of the English and Religion departments at South Hills Catholic High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While a graduate student at the University of Notre Dame, they taught undergraduate courses in the Theology Department and was assistant rector of Grace Hall.
Their first teaching experience at La Salle was as a visiting instructor in the Graduate Religion Program in the summer of 1978. They were also an assistant professor at the Washington Theological Union from 1979 to 1984. From 1986 to 1990, they were a visiting instructor at Loyola University's Summer Institute of Pastoral Studies.
Academic career
In 1984, McGinniss joined the faculty at La Salle on a full-time basis, eventually reaching the rank of full professor in 1993. Recognized by the De La Salle Christian Brothers for their qualities as a leader, they attended La session internationale des études lasalliennes (a program of study of Lasallian spirituality) in Rome in 1991. They became Chair of La Salle's Religion Department in 1991, and the following year they received the Lindback Distinguished Teaching Award. Also in 1992, they were appointed vice president of the La Salle University Corporation. In 1995, they became a member of La Salle's Board of Trustees.
In 1994, they became president of Christian Brothers University. Under their leadership undergraduate enrollment and retention rates were increased; a Graduate from Education Program was established; the Athletic Department joined the NCAA Division II Gulf South Conference; new residence halls were constructed; enhancements were made to science labs and facilities; the school's Engineering departments were re-accredited; an upgrade of information technology systems throughout the campus was implemented; and the Center for Global Enterprise was founded. They also played a key role in the school's 125th anniversary celebration.
They have published articles in such journals as Listening: Journal of Religion and Culture and New Theology Review. They have written chapters in religious books and texts, including “The Catholic University as a Context for Pastoral Studies: Reflections on Three Programs” in Pastoral Studies in the University Setting (University of Ottawa Press). They edited six volumes of the Christian Brothers' Spirituality Seminar Series. Since 1983, their reviews of books have appeared in journals such as Horizons, Theological Studies, Journal of Ecumenical Studies, and Holistic Nursing Practice. For many years, they have lectured to a variety of academic and professional groups on issues related to spirituality, pastoral care, and theology.
Their academic areas of expertise are pastoral theology, history and theology of ministry, methods and models of theological reflection, ecclesiology, and Lasallian spirituality.
McGinniss serves on the Boards of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Pennsylvania, American University of Rome, Manhattan College, Calvert Hall College (Baltimore, Maryland), the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, and the Office of Community Development of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. In addition, they are a member of the Chairman's Advisory Council for the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.
Their professional memberships include the Catholic Theological Society of America, the American Academy of Religion, the College Theology Society, the Lasallian Association of College and University Presidents, and the International Association of Lasallian Universities.
President of La Salle University
Under McGinniss' direction, La Salle University had developed a new strategic plan and significantly increased enrollment, giving, and alumni involvement. La Salle opened a new residence hall for 428 students and an adjoining dining facility in 2005. In cooperation with the board of trustees, McGinniss launched “Shoulder to Shoulder”, a fundraising initiative to raise $25 million for the construction of a new science and technology center and the strengthening of the endowment for student scholarships. Under their leadership, La Salle underwent significant expansion; it began construction of a new business school, dormitories, dining halls, and other resources. The legacy of McGinniss' strategic plan remains ambiguous after their successor was left with a large deficit and faltering credit rating.
When Colleen Hanycz succeeded McGinniss as La Salle University President in 2015, they inherited serious financial straits. There was a $12 million shortfall in La Salle's budget, which represented about 9 percent of the $132 million of the total operating budget. After McGinniss stepped down, there was also a large dip in enrollment. The 2015 first-year student class was about 725, well below its target. Enrollment decreased by 135 students, about 16 percent less, than the 2014 first-year student class of 860.
Post-presidential career
McGinniss continues to live and work at La Salle.  They are currently the advisor of their alma mater's Honors program.

The Oklahoma City Barons were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL). The team's first season was 2010–11. They played their home games at the Cox Convention Center, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
History
On February 9, 2010, the American Hockey League Board of Governors approved of the relocation of the Oilers' inactive AHL franchise to Oklahoma City, after a five-year dormancy. The franchise had gone through six incarnations, the first of which was the Nova Scotia Oilers and most recently the Edmonton Road Runners, who ceased play in 2005. The Barons were named through a fan contest. Before the Barons, the Cox Convention Center in Oklahoma City had also been the home to former Central Hockey League franchises, the Oklahoma City Stars and the Oklahoma City Blazers. Bob Funk Jr., who headed the former Blazers' ownership group, is also at the helm of Prodigal Hockey LLC, the Barons' ownership group.
Todd Nelson served as the Barons' first head coach with Gerry Fleming joining them as their assistant. Bill Scott, a former Director of Hockey Operations for the AHL, served as the Barons' first general manager.
In December 2014, Nelson was promoted to the Oilers' coaching staff as head coach and Fleming being promoted to the Barons' head coach position.
After the team's inaugural season in 2010–11, the Barons finished in the bottom five in the league for average attendance, including worst in the league in 2012–13. On December 18, 2014, the Oilers and Barons announced that the Barons would cease operations after the current season citing continued financial losses stemming from poor attendance.
On January 29, 2015, the AHL announced that the Edmonton Oilers' AHL franchise would be located in Bakersfield, California, replacing the Barons beginning with the 2015–16 season. The Oilers' owned-and-operated Bakersfield Condors are part of a new Pacific Division that introduced the league to the state of California.
Team information
Logos and uniforms
The Oklahoma City Barons colors were midnight blue, copper and white (with red used for outlining) later on changed to blue, orange and white. This color palette was also used by the Edmonton Oilers between 1996 and 2011. The Barons' logo prominently features an oil derrick, symbolizing a rich tradition in the production of oil in the state of Oklahoma, and further showcasing the similarities between the cities of Edmonton and Oklahoma City.
Like the other 29 teams in the American Hockey League, the Oklahoma City Barons played in the Reebok EDGE style uniforms. The Barons' home uniform was a white jersey with a midnight blue collar and trim the white jersey, while their away uniform is a midnight blue jersey with a copper collar and trim, with the Barons logo placed on the front. These jerseys have been styled from the Edmonton Oilers' now-former away and alternate jerseys, respectively. The Barons' shoulder logos also include the Edmonton Oilers logo and the "OKC" secondary logo.
Mascot
The Oklahoma City Barons' official team mascot was a mountain lion, named Derrick. Derrick was officially introduced on July 27, 2010, after a lengthy "Name the Mascot" fan contest, which was held on the Barons' website. Derrick's role within the Barons' organization was to interact with fans; having their photo taken, meeting and greeting, and signing autographs during their home games. They also make public appearances in and around Oklahoma City.
On February 19, 2012, the Barons introduced another mountain lion, named Bit, as a secondary mascot.

Apidae is the largest family within the superfamily Apoidea, containing at least 5700 species of bees. The family includes some of the most commonly seen bees, including bumblebees and honey bees, but also includes stingless bees (also used for honey production), carpenter bees, orchid bees, cuckoo bees, and a number of other less widely known groups. Many are valuable pollinators in natural habitats and for agricultural crops.
Taxonomy
In addition to its historical classification (honey bees, bumble bees, stingless bees and orchid bees), the family Apidae presently includes all the genera formerly placed in the families Anthophoridae and Ctenoplectridae. Although the most visible members of Apidae are social, the vast majority of apid bees are solitary, including a number of cleptoparasitic species.
The old family Apidae contained four tribes (Apinae: Apini, Euglossini and Bombinae: Bombini, Meliponini) which have been reclassified as tribes of the subfamily Apinae, along with all of the former tribes and subfamilies of Anthophoridae and the former family Ctenoplectridae, which was demoted to tribe status. The trend to move groups down in taxonomic rank has been taken further by a 2005 Brazilian classification that places all existing bee families together under the name "Apidae", but it has not been widely accepted in the literature since that time.
Subfamilies
Apinae
The subfamily Apinae contains honey bees, bumblebees, stingless bees, orchid bees, and digger bees, among others. The bees of most tribes placed in Apinae are solitary with nests that are simple burrows in the soil. However, honey bees, stingless bees, and bumblebees are eusocial or colonial. These are sometimes believed to have each developed this trait independently, and show notable differences in such characteristics as communication between workers and methods of nest construction.
Tribes include:
Ancylaini
Anthophorini
Apini
Bombini
Centridini
Ctenoplectrini
Emphorini—(Subtribe Ancyloscelidina; Subtribe Emphorina)
Ericrocidini
Eucerini
Euglossini
Exomalopsini
Isepeolini
Melectini
Meliponini
Osirini
Protepeolini
Rhathymini
Tapinotaspidini
Tarsaliini
Tetrapediini
Teratognathini
Nomadinae
The subfamily Nomadinae, or cuckoo bees, has 31 genera in 10 tribes which are all cleptoparasites in the nests of other bees.
Tribes include:
Ammobatini
Ammobatoidini
Biastini
Brachynomadini
Caenoprosopidini
Epeolini—(Subtribe Epeolina; Subtribe Odyneropsina; Subtribe Thalestriina)
Hexepeolini
Neolarrini
Nomadini
Townsendiellini
Xylocopinae
The subfamily Xylocopinae, which includes carpenter bees, are mostly solitary, though they tend to be gregarious. Some tribe lineages, such as the Allodapini, contain eusocial species.
Most members of this subfamily make nests in plant stems or wood.
Tribes include:
Allodapini
Ceratinini
Manueliini
Xylocopini

Cy the Cardinal is the mascot of Iowa State University's sports teams.
Because a cyclone was difficult to depict in costume, a cardinal was selected from the cardinal and gold of the official school colors. A cardinal-like bird was introduced at the 1954 homecoming pep rally. A contest was conducted to select a name for the mascot, and the winning entry of Cy was submitted by 17 people. The first to submit the name, Mrs. Wilma Ohlsen, won a cardinal and gold stadium blanket.
Over the last half century, Cy has undergone several makeovers and redesigns. The first Cy was approximately tall with a bulging chest made mostly from chicken wire and aluminum. Cy was again transformed when ISU Athletics changed the school's logo and color combinations.
Due to the size and weight of the original costume, there were some physical requirements for students who wanted to fill the role of Cy. Applicants needed to be 5'11” (180.3 cm) to 6'2” (188 cm) and weigh 175 to 210 pounds (79.4 to 95.25 kg). When Cy first was introduced, only one student served as Cy. Now Cy is performing in public about 200 days a year, and four to six students share mascot duties. Today, physical attributes are not as important because the costume is available in three sizes.
Cy makes appearances at various Cyclone sporting events such as football, men's and women's basketball, volleyball, wrestling, soccer, softball, and gymnastics. In addition to sporting events, Cy is often requested to make various appearances across the state of Iowa for a number of events. Cy also competes each year at the NCAA College Mascot Nationals in Daytona Beach, Florida.
Recognition
Cy has won two national mascot challenges since 2007; the CBS Sportsline Most Dominant College Mascot on Earth in 2007, and the CapitalOne Bowl National Mascot of the Year in 2008.

Graphical system design (GSD) is a modern approach to designing measurement and control systems that integrates system design software with COTS hardware to dramatically simplify development. This approach combines user interfaces, models of computation, math and analysis, Input/output signals, technology abstractions, and various deployment target. It allows domain experts, or non- implementation experts, to access to design capabilities where they would traditionally need to outsource a system design expert.
This approach to system design is a super-set of electronic system-level (ESL) design. Graphical system design expands on the EDA-based ESL definition to include other types of embedded system design including industrial machines and medical devices. Many of these expanded applications can be defined as "the long tail" applications.
System-level design
Graphical system design is an approach to designing an entire system, using more intuitive graphical software and off-the-shelf (non-custom) hardware devices to refine the design, create initial prototypes and even use for the few runs of deployments. The approach may involve Algorithm engineering. The approach can prove successful when designers need to get something to market quickly (medical video: ) or with a team of non-embedded experts like Boston Engineering to create a mechatronics-based machine.
"Graphical system design is a complementary but encompassing platform-based approach that includes embedded and electronic system design, implementation, and verification tools. ESL and graphical system design are really part of the same movement--higher abstraction and more design automation looking to solve the real engineering challenges that designers are facing today--addressing design flaws that are introduced at the specification stage to ensure they're detected well before validation for on-time product delivery."
Tools
Graphical system design relies on open connectivity. For example, tools that can be used in the design phase include (in alphabetical order): Ansoft Designer, AutoCAD, CarSim, DOORS, Dymola, LabVIEW, MSC.Adams, NI Multisim, NEi Nastran, SolidWorks, SPICE, OpenWire (library).
The prototyping stage is more about taking algorithm design and implementing them on hardware for higher quality designs. An effective prototyping platform includes a high-level language, real-time processors, FPGA logic, modular I/O and any intellectual property needed.
The deployment stage is mostly about hardware - where you put your design in the final stage. This may involve MPUs or FPGAs.
Examples
Examples of engineers and scientists applying graphical system design techniques include:
Graphical System Design for Digital Radio Mondiale
Researchers Use Graphical System Design for Development and Control of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles
Developing a Robotic Manipulator for Cancer Therapy Using Graphical System Design
Graphical system design for embedded control systems

Some Kind of Heaven is a 2020 American documentary film about The Villages, Florida, the world's largest retirement community. Marking the directorial feature debut of Lance Oppenheim, the film is a stylized portrait of four residents living within The Villages, Florida, struggling to find happiness and meaning in life's final chapters. The film, produced by Darren Aronofsky, The New York Times, and Los Angeles Media Fund premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was the sole documentary to play in the NEXT section, a category known for "pure, bold works distinguished by innovative, forward-thinking approach[es] to storytelling". It was released in theaters and on-demand in the United States on January 15, 2021, by Magnolia Pictures.
Synopsis
At The Villages, often called the "Disney World for Retirees", we meet four residents living on the margins, striving to find happiness. From synchronized swimming to pickleball, the good life is waiting, as well as a discounted funeral package now at a new, lower price. While most residents have bought into the community's packaged positivity, married couple Anne and Reggie wrestle with Reggie's deteriorating grip on reality and psychedelic drug use; Barbara, a widow, seeks second love; and Dennis, an 82-year-old bachelor, living out of a van, searches for a wealthy woman to take care of them for their remaining years. Though the film "illustrates the gap between The Villages' advertising copy and the practical reality of living there", Some Kind of Heaven invests more in the "dreams and desires of its residents".
Development and production
The film initially emerged from director Lance Oppenheim's undergraduate thesis in the Visual and Environmental Studies program at Harvard University, where they collaborated with classmate and co-producer Christian Vazquez. At Harvard, Oppenheim worked on an earlier version of the film under the tutelage of filmmakers Robb Moss, Ross McElwee, Lucien Castaing-Taylor, and Alfred Guzzetti, which informed the creation of the rest of the project. The film continued to develop through the Sundance Ignite program, of which Oppenheim was a fellow.
A Floridian, Oppenheim was interested in returning home to explore why "thousands of retirees were moving across the country, isolating themselves in a Truman Show-like bubble-world that reminded them of their youth". Before filming, Oppenheim ventured to The Villages and lived in a rented room for nearly thirty days with retired rodeo clowns to embed themselves into the social fabric of the place. Production took place over four shoots (scattered across eighteen months) with a crew of five – Oppenheim, Vazquez, cinematographer David Bolen, Melissa Oppenheim Lano (Oppenheim's sister and lead physical producer), and sound recordist Richard Carlos. Bolen, the cinematographer of the film, worked with Oppenheim to develop the heightened style and look of the film before production. Bolen and Oppenheim have been collaborating since the latter was 17 years old. Using inspiration from Larry Sultan's Pictures from Home series, Ulrich Seidl, Todd Haynes' Safe, and Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, Oppenheim and Bolen wanted the film's images to mirror the controlled, manicured and hyperreal landscapes of The Villages.
After collaborating with Kathleen Lingo at The New York Times on their three previous short documentaries for Op-Docs, Oppenheim approached Lingo regarding the film, initially envisioning it as a short documentary. Lingo urged Oppenheim to develop the project into a feature, thus sparking their fourth collaboration – and one of The New York Times''' first feature film production – together. Darren Aronofsky met Oppenheim when they were still a senior in college after Oppenheim "found [his] email on the internet" and spent nearly five years sending unsolicited cold-emails. Upon finally getting in touch with Aronofsky and their team at Protozoa Pictures, Oppenheim shared a sizzle reel to the film. Aronofsky, impressed with the surreal setting and film's visual approach, signed on shortly after that.
Editor Daniel Garber joined the project starting when only a quarter of the footage had been shot. Garber worked with Oppenheim to give the film's stories their shape, even visiting The Villages to get a better sense of the place. In interviews, Oppenheim has credited Garber as the film's "co-author", and being integral in the creating a grammar that "was more experiential than other documentaries... something that felt like a narrative film but retained the integrity of being 100% grounded in reality". Oppenheim and composer Ari Balouzian conceived of the score as an "integral part of the story they wanted to tell", embracing a "dreamy, orchestral sounds with harp inflections that invoke Old Hollywood to capture the tension between the sunny, polished exterior of The Villages and its harsher day-to-day realities".
Critical response
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average of . The website's critics' consensus reads: "Some Kind of Heaven could have gone deeper into its subject, but it remains a breezily entertaining look at some interesting people."
The film was described by Dennis Harvey of Variety as "highly entertaining…those nostalgic for the fond portraits of eccentric Americana in Errol Morris' early work—and pretty much everyone else—will be delighted by the film". Beandrea July of The Hollywood Reporter echoed similar sentiments, remarking that the film is a "solid feature debut from a bright young filmmaker who, despite their age, is able to expand our understanding of the complicated lives of older Americans".
Vadim Rizov of Filmmaker praised the film for possessing a "visual discipline rare in US nonfiction", as did Vikram Murthi of review site RogerEbert.com who wrote: "Oppenheim's keen compositional sense perfectly bolsters the film's narrative: each carefully crafted frame provides whomever is in it with inherent worth".
Eric Hynes of Film Comment took particular interest in the "age gap between Oppenheim and their subjects", impressed by the level of trust and respect that Oppenheim was able to foster: "I'm intrigued by a young filmmaker identifying with persons at the other end of the life cycle, and the older subjects, in turn, respecting and trusting someone like Oppenheim with the less-than-cute fogey matters of loneliness, financial insecurity, marital discord, and unceasingly disorienting change. I hazard to think that the film's mutual curiosity gives Some Kind of Heaven'' its vivifying spirit, that transforms what might have been familiarly charming and smirkily knowing into something more troubling, elusive, and enduring".

Daniel Lewis Hansford (March 1, 1960 – May 2, 1981) was an American shooting victim who was killed by their employer, preservationist Jim Williams, at Williams' home in Savannah, Georgia, United States. Their death was documented in John Berendt's 1994 non-fiction book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and its 1997 film adaptation. After four trials, Williams was acquitted of Hansford's murder.
Early life
Danny Hansford was born in Savannah, Georgia, to Emily Bannister. They were one of three sons, the others being John and William.
Shooting
In the early hours of May 2, 1981, Hansford and preservationist Jim Williams had an argument at Williams's residence at Mercer House, in Monterey Square, Savannah, Georgia. During the argument, Hansford, of whom Williams had been a sexual partner for about two years, pushed over an 18th-century English grandfather clock. Williams was in their study at the time, and Hansford soon entered, whereupon they drew a gun on Williams. The gun jammed upon firing, however, and Williams pulled a 9mm Luger pistol from their desk and shot Hansford in what they claim was self-defense. Prosecutors claimed Williams then proceeded to stage the crime scene to make it appear as if Hansford had actually fired at him. Williams called the police at 3:00 A.M. to report the shooting, just over half an hour after the incident occurred. They were taken into custody and charged with murder. Superior Court Judge Eugene H. Gadsden set Williams' bond at $25,000, which they soon posted.
Hansford, 21, was buried in Greenwich Cemetery, which is adjacent to Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah.  They are buried beside their mother, who died in 2005 at age 65.
Trials
Williams was tried four times, a record for the state of Georgia. Bobby Lee Cook defended Williams during the first trial in 1982, presided over by Judge George Oliver. Williams was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. They appealed, posting the $100,000 bond. Cook later anonymously received a copy of the police report showing that the arresting officer had contradicted themselves about a bullet hole in a floor in Mercer House. The verdict was overturned in January 1983 by the Georgia Supreme Court and a new trial was ordered. As Berendt wrote in their book: "The ruling appeared to be little more than a temporary reprieve. The hole in the floor had been unimportant in the trial; the main points of evidence in Spencer Lawton's case against Williams still remained intact."
Sonny Seiler assumed Williams' defense at the second trial beginning in September 1983 and decided to have Williams openly bring up their sexuality. Little else differed from the first trial: on October 8, Williams was again found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. In June 1985, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned the conviction again, stating that the sheriff should not have been allowed to testify as an expert, and that the prosecutor waited until their closing argument to demonstrate some evidence.
The third trial, held in the spring of 1987, resulted in a mistrial. New evidence showed Hansford's hands were not bagged by the police at the crime scene, which meant that if there was gunpowder residue present on the victim's hands it could have been rubbed off during the subsequent movement of the body. During deliberations, a juror supposedly called a paramedic to ask some medical questions, though it could not be proven. After two deliberations, the jury still had not reached a verdict, with one woman adamantly insisting they saw reasonable doubt and would not alter their verdict. On June 9, 1987, with 11-1 jurors in favor of a "guilty" verdict, it was declared a hung jury.
The fourth and final trial, which was moved to Augusta, resulted in Williams' acquittal in May 1989, eight years after their conviction, after the jury's hour-long deliberation.
On January 14, 1990, after eight months of being a free man, Williams collapsed and died at home.  They are believed to have died in their study, the scene of the shooting.
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil
Hansford was renamed Billy Hanson in the 1997 Clint Eastwood-directed movie adaptation of the book, in which they were portrayed by Jude Law.

The biodiversity of New Zealand, a large island country located in the south-western Pacific Ocean, is varied and distinctive. The species of New Zealand accumulated over many millions of years as lineages evolved in the local circumstances. New Zealand's pre-human biodiversity exhibited high levels of species endemism, but has experienced episodes of biological turnover. Global extinction approximately 65 Ma (million years ago) resulted in the loss of fauna such as non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs and marine reptiles e.g. mosasaurs, elasmosaurs and plesiosaurs. The ancient fauna is not well known, but at least one species of terrestrial mammal existed in New Zealand around 19 Ma. For at least several million years before the arrival of human and commensal species, the islands had no terrestrial mammals except for bats and seals, the main component of the terrestrial fauna being insects and birds. As recently as the 14th century a component has been introduced by humans, including many terrestrial mammals.
New Zealand has developed a national Biodiversity Action Plan to address conservation of considerable numbers of threatened flora and fauna within New Zealand.
Evolution
The break-up of the supercontinent of Gondwana left the resulting continents and microcontinents with shared biological affinities. Zealandia (the continental crust from which New Zealand and New Caledonia later developed) began to move away from Antarctic Gondwana 85 Ma ago, the break being complete by 66 Ma ago. It has been moving northwards since then, changing both in relief and climate. About 23 million years ago New Zealand was mostly underwater. One estimate suggests just 18% of the present surface area remained above the water. However geological evidence does not rule out the possibility that it was entirely submerged, or at least restricted to small islands. Today about 93% of the Zealandian continent remains below the sea. Several elements of Gondwana biota are present in New Zealand today: predominantly plants, such as the podocarps and the southern beeches, but also a distinctive insect fauna, New Zealand's unusual frogs and the tuatara, as well as some of New Zealand's birds. It seems likely that some primitive mammals also were part of the original cargo. Whether or not any of these taxa are descendants of survivors of that ancient cargo remains unproven. Recent molecular evidence has shown that even the iconic Gondwanan plants the southern beeches (Nothofagus) arrived in New Zealand after separation of Zealandia from Gondwana. There is a high rate of interspecific and intraspecific hybridisation in New Zealand plants and animals.
The two sources of New Zealand's biodiversity following separation from Gondwana have been speciation and air- or sea-borne immigration. Most of these immigrants have arrived from Australia, and have provided the majority of New Zealand's birds and bats as well as some plant species (carried on the wind or inside the guts of birds). Some of these immigrants arrived long enough ago that their affinities to their Australian ancestors are uncertain; for example, the affinities of the unusual short-tailed bats (Mystacinidae) were unknown until fossils from the Miocene were found in Australia. Cyanoramphus parakeets are thought to have originated in New Caledonia and have been successful at reaching many islands in the region. The link between the two island groups also includes affinities between skink and gecko families.
Elements
Floral biodiversity
The history, climate and geology of New Zealand have created a great deal of diversity in New Zealand's vegetation types. The main two types of forest have been dominated by podocarps and southern beech. Podocarps (Podocarpaceae), an ancient evergreen gymnosperm family of trees, have changed little in the last 190 million years. Forests dominated by podocarps form a closed canopy with an understory of hardwoods and shrubs. The forests of southern beeches, from the genus Nothofagus, comprise a less diverse habitat, with the beeches of four species dominating the canopy and allowing a single understory. In the north of New Zealand the podocarp forests were dominated by the ancient giant kauri. These trees are amongst the largest in the world, holding the record for the greatest timber volume of any tree. The value of this was not lost on early European settlers, and most of these trees were felled.
The remaining vegetation types in New Zealand are grassland of grass and tussock, usually associated with the subalpine areas, and the low shrublands between grasslands and forests. These shrublands are dominated by daisies, which can become woody and 3 m high. New Zealand had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.12/10, ranking it 55th globally out of 172 countries.
In addition to terrestrial plants, New Zealand is home to many species of algae. Many species of southern bull kelp are found along the coasts of the main islands, Chatham Islands and the Subantarctic Islands.
Faunal diversity
Until 2006, it was thought that no mammals, other than bats and marine mammals, had reached New Zealand before humans did. The discovery of a femur and mandibles of an extinct non-volant (non-flying) mammal in Otago, dated at 16–19 million years old, has changed the view of New Zealand's evolutionary history, as it strongly suggests that mammals had been part of New Zealand's fauna since the break-up of Gondwana. The fossil has been called SB mammal. It is not known when, or why, land mammals became extinct in New Zealand but there were none present on New Zealand for several million years before the arrival of humans.
The short-tailed bats (from the monotypic family Mystacinidae), first arrived in the Oligocene or before. These are unique among bats due to their terrestrial foraging habits; this has long been credited to the absence of competing terrestrial mammals, though the presence of the already terrestrial Icarops in the Miocene of Australia shows that their terrestriality evolved in the mainland, while Saint Bathans Fauna mystacine fossils co-existed with another terrestrial mammal, the Saint Bathans mammal. Some plants have evolved with the bats and are fertilised on the ground by the bats. The long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus), a more recent arrival, is relatively common. The Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna also preserves remains of a vesper bat and several incertae sedis species.
Birds comprise the most important part of New Zealand's vertebrate fauna. It is uncertain if many birds in New Zealand are descended from Gondwanan stock, as DNA evidence suggests that even the ratites (the kiwis and the moas) arrived after the split from Antarctica. Recent studies suggest that New Zealand wrens are Gondwanan descendants. DNA studies seem to indicate that the wrens are the most ancient of all passerines, splitting from the ancestral passerine stock at the time New Zealand become an isolated land mass. In the absence of mammals, birds diversified into the niches usually filled by mammals in other ecosystems.
The moas, of which there were eleven species, were large browsers, and were in turn the prey species of the giant Haast's eagle. Both the moas and the eagle became extinct shortly after the arrival of humans in New Zealand sometime around 1300 CE. It appears that human hunters exterminated the moa populations, which deprived the Haast's eagle of its primary food source, leading to the extinction of that species as well. New Zealand's emblematic kiwis fill the role of small foragers of the leaf-litter, and the enigmatic adzebill was a universal omnivore. The wattlebirds, Callaeidae, are a family endemic to New Zealand, but many other New Zealand birds show clear affinities to Australia, including the New Zealand pigeon and the New Zealand falcon, as well as various parrots, rails, waders, owls, and seabirds (albeit often with a New Zealand twist). Of the 245 species of birds from the greater New Zealand (the main islands along with the offshore islands, also including Norfolk Island), 174 were endemic, roughly 71%. Of these, about 32% of the genera were endemic.
No agamas or iguanas are recorded from New Zealand; lizards are represented by geckos and skinks, which arrived multiple times. The fossil record shows a highly diverse herpetofauna during the Miocene, with a mekosuchine crocodile and meiolaniid and pleurodire turtles being known from the Saint Bathans Fauna. The tuatara, reaching 60 cm (23.6 inches), is New Zealand's largest living reptile, a last remnant from the once diverse clade that was Sphenodontia. Frogs, which because of their intolerance for saltwater are assumed to have descended from ancestors that broke off from Gondwana, are one of the few exceptions to the rule that amphibians are never found on oceanic islands (another being the frogs of Fiji). New Zealand's few wholly freshwater fishes are derived from diadromous species.
New Zealand's terrestrial invertebrate community displays strong Gondwanan affinities, and has also diversified strongly, if unevenly. There are over a thousand species of snail, and many species of insect have become large and in many cases flightless, especially grasshoppers and beetles. There are, however, fewer than 12 species of ant. The most famous of New Zealand's insects, the wētā, are ground-living relatives of the crickets that often reach enormous proportions. Many endemic marine invertebrate species, particularly marine snails, have evolved in the seas surrounding New Zealand.
Endemism
New Zealand has a high number of endemic species, such as:
80% of all vascular plants
70% of all native terrestrial and freshwater birds
All bats
All native amphibians
All reptiles
90% of freshwater fish
90% of insects and molluscs
75% of marine molluscs alone
Of New Zealand's estimated 20,000 fungi species, only about 4,500 are known. New Zealand also has two subspecies of endemic cetaceans, Hector's dolphin and its close relative Maui's dolphin.
Human impact
The arrival of humans in New Zealand has presented a challenge for the native species, causing the extinction of several. This is predominantly because many species in New Zealand have evolved in the absence of mammalian predators for the last few million years (a situation known as ecological naivety), thus losing the responses needed to deal with such threats. Humans brought with them to New Zealand (intentionally or otherwise) a host of attendant species, starting with the Polynesian rat, and now including stoats, weasels, black rats, Norway rats, brushtailed possums, and feral cats and dogs, as well as herbivores such as deer, wallabies and tahr (a wild goat species from the Himalayas), which detrimentally affect native vegetation.
The date of the first arrival of the Māori in New Zealand is given as around 1300 CE, and evidence suggests that Polynesian rats seemed to have arrived at a similar date. Their arrival set off a first wave of extinctions, eliminating smaller defenceless ground nesting birds such as the New Zealand owlet-nightjar. A second wave of extinctions was triggered by the arrival of the Māori, who hunted many of the larger species, such as the moa, adzebill and several large ducks and geese, for food. The Haast's eagle and Eyles's harrier are thought to have gone extinct due to the loss of their food source. A third wave of extinction began with the arrival of European settlers, who brought with them numerous new mammal species, particularly the predatory domestic cat, and initiated more habitat modification. In all, over 50% of New Zealand's bird species are considered extinct, along with a species of bat (the New Zealand greater short-tailed bat), several frogs (only four frog types remain), a freshwater fish (the New Zealand greyling), skinks, and geckos.
In some instances, the extinction of New Zealand's native fauna has brought about a natural colonisation from Australia. In the case of the silvereye, which colonised New Zealand in the 19th century, it had no relative in New Zealand's original fauna and is now restricted to newer human-made niches. In the case of the black swan (which was originally thought to have been introduced by humans but is now suspected to have self-introduced), the invading species re-occupied part of its former range (the extinct New Zealand swan is now believed to be a subspecies of the black swan). The arrival of the pukeko and the swamp harrier is more interesting, mirroring the arrival of related species in the past, before they evolved into the takahe and the Eyles's harrier. Once these specialised birds declined and (in the case of the harrier) became extinct, their niches were available and colonisation could occur again.
Management
The New Zealand government, through the Department of Conservation, works aggressively to protect what remains of New Zealand's biological heritage. It has pioneered work on island restoration where offshore islands are systematically cleared of introduced species such as goats, feral cats and rats. This then allows the re-introduction of native species that can hopefully flourish in the absence of non-native predators and competitors. The longest running project of this type is on Cuvier Island, but other islands are also being used such as Tiritiri Matangi and Mangere Island.
Establishment of conservation areas is not restricted to islands however and several ecological islands have been established on the New Zealand mainland which are isolated by the use of pest-exclusion fences.

Lives of Omission is a 2011 Hong Kong action crime thriller television series produced by TVB under executive producer Chong Wai-kin. The drama is a spin-off of TVB's successful television crime drama E.U. and a distant sequel to the 2009 film Turning Point, with Michael Tse reprising their role as "Laughing Gor." Lives of Omission premiered on 1 August 2011 and ended on 9 September 2011 with a total of 30 episodes. It is Hong Kong's second highest-rating serial drama of 2011, and won Best Drama at the 2011 TVB Anniversary Awards.
Lives of Omission takes places two years after the events of E.U., and centers on a squad of undercover officers from the Criminal Intelligence Bureau (CIB) of the Hong Kong Police Force, who are closely following the activities of Yee Fung (義豐), a large triad society. Experienced undercover officer Laughing (Tse), a station sergeant of CIB, promises to help gangster Michael (Bosco Wong) move up the ranks within the triad under the circumstance that they work as Laughing's informant.
Plot
Laughing (Michael Tse), who presumably died during the events of E.U., used their death as a cover to perform a long term undercover mission in Dongguan, China. After completing their mission, Laughing returns to Hong Kong where CIB's superintendent, Harry Kung (Damian Lau), recruits them into their department to become team leader and teacher to new police recruits. On Laughing's very first day, they encounter a woman that greatly resembles their former lover, Karen (from Turning Point); they are Laughing's new commander and second lead in CIB, Senior Inspector Jodie Chau (both played by Fala Chen). Together, their assignment is to recruit and train rookies in the art of undercover and espionage. However, things do not go as smoothly as desired.
Laughing exhibits an unprofessional attitude in CIB headquarters and does many things without informing their fellow agents; it often causes everyone to question their motives. While recruiting for new agents, they manage to reserve one agent for themselves to choose. They ultimately choose Lap Ching (Jin), a talented, but problematic rookie under their wing. With their team assembled, they begin training them in the art of undercover police investigation and the methods of the trade.
For years, the CIB has been trying to crack down one of Hong Kong's largest triad organizations, Yee Fung. As both a means of training and to investigate against Yee Fung, Laughing and Jodie have their rookies investigate Lat Keung (Spicy Ginger, Ben Wong). To further dig deeper into Yee Fung's operations, Lap Ching was sent in as a low-level gang and pimp to feed CIB information about one of Yee Fung's major figureheads. In between this time, Laughing chooses to work with Michael So (Bosco Wong), a crippled low-level gangster in Yee Fung. Seeing their ambition, Laughing and Michael have a mutual manipulative relationship to help each other benefit in their respective situations. Ultimately, the operation is considered a success as they detain and charge many of Lat Keung's group in illegal prostitution and racketeering. In the process, Michael rises within the ranks of Yee Fung and gains notoriety.
The results of the mission do not sit well with Laughing as they know Michael went behind their back and did many things to help themselves rise; unfortunately, even with Laughing's skills, they can not take down Michael. Using their intellect, Michael quickly rises higher and eventually leads their own group within Yee Fung. Using the power of the internet, they create new inventive ways to sell drugs at a record pace without HKPD interference.
Laughing tried to get another rookie go undercover in attempt to stop Michael, but the process leaves their agent brain damaged and reduced to a wheelchair for the rest of their life. In order to stop Yee Fung, Laughing agrees to become an undercover agent for a fourth time. Using their frustration over their rookie's demise as a ploy, Laughing creates a situation where their behavior could no longer be tolerated by the HKPD and have them kicked out and even sent to jail. All of this drama was to establish their washed-up credibility to be considered by Yee Fung.
Not long after, Yee Fung's leader, the Dragon Head, Mok Yat-lit (Cheung Kwok-keung), noticed Laughing's talents and recruited them as their new star member. Working alongside Michael, the duo begin to gain territories and investments at record levels that impresses all of Yee Fung. In between undercover work, Laughing and Jodie become romantically involved. Being Laughing's handler, Jodie tries to keep their relationship professional, but Laughing doesn't make it easy for them In order to dig in deeper for dirt on Mok Yat-lit, Laughing wins the heart of Mok Yat-lit's mistress, Ting Man, to discover their secret cocaine stash. However, to their surprise, Mok Yat-lit escapes capture because they have planted a mole within CIB.
Ultimately, Mok Yat-lit is sent to jail. Under the advice of their lawyers, they manipulate their mistress to take the fall for the bulk of their recent crimes and they agree to plead guilty under lesser charges for a few months in jail. However, even in jail, Mok Yat-lit's influence on Yee Fung still remains strong. Sensing the ambitious nature of Michael, they have one of their lieutenants kill Michael; ironically, the lieutenant sides with Michael and has them killed in a jail shower. After their death, Michael wins the election and becomes the new Dragon Head of Yee Fung.
After gaining control of Yee Fung, Michael sets their sights to greater goals by joining a secret black organization: Ether Union. Ether Union is a group of influential business people who share their resources together to mutually gain greater riches than either could've done individually. Ether Union fell as Laughing's interventions eventually leads to the downfall of both Ether Union and Yee Fung. The majority of the Ether Union members escape, but they were all suspicious of Michael as one of them received information from a police mole that Michael had incriminating evidence against them in their home. To prevent further doubt, Michael blames all of the accusations on their wife, Paris (Kate Tsui). They shoot them and throws their body in the water to prevent further doubt. However, all of the Ether Union members were eventually tracked and arrested, except for Michael.
During a confrontation with Michael, Jodie is held as a hostage in an industrial building. When the members of Ether Union were arrested, their utility rings were also confiscated. These rings contained an alarm system as well as a laser decoder that flashed the numbers of a secret account containing vast riches. With all except Michael arrested, Michael is left with sole access to the secret account. The hostage situation doesn't go well; Michael has to flee, but they fling Jodie over the hangar to their death. Enraged with their death, Laughing lures Michael out and kills them by shooting them in the chest. After the police arrive, Laughing is arrested and found guilty of murder. For their crime, they are jailed for life.
After these occurrences, Kung-sir retired from their position as superintendent for CIB. Lap Ching would become a decorated CIB agent and returned to the undercover life. It was revealed that Paris's death was faked. In a letter, Michael explained that their ploy to gain control of Ether Union could've been too much if exposed; the only way to gain trust was to fake their death. Paris had secretly hidden themselves in a country house for an unknown period of time to avoid the lash of Ether Union. Laughing continues to live out their life sentence in jail, but under the hateful watch of criminals they helped incarcerate. Laughing's story continues on in the events of Turning Point II.

"Giving Myself" is a song recorded by American recording artist Jennifer Hudson. It was written and produced by singer-songwriter Robin Thicke, along with their frequent co-producer Pro Jay, for their eponymous debut album, released in 2008. An eleventh hour replacement for Timbaland-produced "Pocketbook", the pop–soul ballad was selected as the album's third and final single and sent to US radios on June 2, 2009. Upon release, it charted at number 84 on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
Background
"Giving Myself" is a pop–soul ballad written and produced by Robin Thicke, with co-production helmed by frequent collaborator Pro Jay. Tony Reyes played the guitar and Larry Cox the organ while Thicke and Jay contributed Backing vocals and drums. Rich Travali mixed the track, while audio recording of "Giving Myself" was overseen by Bill Molina. A slightly different arrangement of the song was released as the single, with the original arraignment only made available through the physical version of the album. Speaking about what motivated them to record the song, Hudson said: "It's unexpected from me, but it still is me. I love how [Thicke] allowed me to be me but introduced another side. They introduced a more vulnerable side vocally, but yet they put it with the ballad side of Jennifer." In an interview with E! Online, Thicke also elaborated on the recording process, stating: "Luckily, their voice is ready to go at all times. They showed up, I had this great little song in the spirit of Whitney Houston, and they sat down next to me and I started singing it for her, and they loved it right off the bat. We got them behind the microphone and they Jennifer Hudson-ed it."
Critical reception
Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle felt that "Thicke's 'Giving Myself' is a nice surprise, an old-school diva ballad a la Stephanie Mills, Jennifer Holliday and Patti LaBelle, while The Washington Posts J. Freedom du Lac found, the song was "an emotional, devotional soul showcase, a classic piano ballad designed to show off Hudson's big, brassy voice." Digital Spy, on the other hand, called "Giving Myself" a "boring, sappy love song," which along with "You Pulled Me Through", "don't seem to belong on the same album as 'Pocketbook'."

Foreland Point is a rocky headland in Devon near Lynmouth, and is the most northerly point along the Devon and Exmoor coast. The highest cliff is above the high tide, although the highest point of the entire headland is near Countisbury (a village around a mile away) at . The headland is owned by the National Trust; some areas are open to public access all year, as part of the South West Coast Path, while other areas have limited access. The Trinity House-operated Lynmouth Foreland Lighthouse is also located here.
The area of the sea between Bideford and Foreland Point is a Marine Conservation Zone.

The Circus Games Mosaic is a 2nd-century Roman mosaic depicting a chariot race in quadrigas. It was discovered in 1806 in the Ainay district of Lyon (ancient Lugdunum) and is now on display in the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon.
Discovery
This mosaic is also known as mosaic "Macors" named Paul Macors, owner closed which were discovered mosaics in the Ainay area between 1806 and 1809. According to the chroniclers of the time, it could have been discovered at three different but nearby places: either at the southeast corner of Rue Victor Hugo and Jarente, 24 rue Jarente or even 39 rue Victor Hugo.
On Lot VI, the so-called "circus" mosaic was unearthed on February 18, 1806 by workers digging a reservoir. Buried under a meter of topsoil, it has no index ruin. Reddish gravel that covered the mosaic suggests it had been covered to protect it. Only the Greek surrounds the mosaic and intended to visually increase the size is very degraded. Macors Paul, conscious of their wealth, built a small Doric temple above the mosaic in order to protect it.
From 5 to 20 June 1806, the people of Lyon and other curious could visit the mosaic for a small fee that was to pay the effort of the workers. June 26, 1806, teachers and students were invited to observe the mosaic and the garden, probably during the construction of the temple. We do not know when the visit is possible again, but Mr. Macors states that from 1 November 1808 to 1 May 1809, the mosaic will be more visible and will be made new digs. They discover a new mosaic called "Meleager" it does protect the construction of a second flag. Arts lovers, Mr. Macors decided to create the Circle Garden Mosaics so visitors are curious and cultivate their knowledge and offer a moment of rest and entertainment in a place where the attractions are no different from neighboring breweries. This Circle lasted only a year 1 July 1809 to 30 June 1810, and the death of Paul Macors 12 March 1811 precipitated the sale of the Garden Mosaics. City Council deliberated on 29 May 1811 on the subject and decided to create a commission to determine the procedures for the acquisition of land by the city. The Council decided to postpone its decision at the meeting of April 20, 1812. The report "Chaussagne the" fixed the purchase price of the mosaic to 5000 francs and then plans to buy the adjoining land. Council adjourned its decision.
Mr. Macors field is then divided into two: north and south house the temple which covers the mosaic. The auction takes place on September 18, 1812 and the fields are awarded to Vincent Depierre and their son Charles, residing in rue Sainte-Catherine. The new owners made a new offer to the City Council and it is then that the prefect, Monsieur le Comte de Bondy suggested to the mayor to include a sum of 6,000 francs on the 1813 budget for the acquisition of the mosaic so that the city retains it. This was too late because the mosaic has been sold on August 10, 1813 to two architects, Jacques and Victor Ruffaut Rivoiron for 4,900 francs. The architects destroyed the temple and decided to transfer the mosaic to Paris. This is not counting on the will of the mayor of Lyon, Albon, who under the law of 18 Brumaire Year III on the protection of monuments, makes an order prohibiting the removal of the two mosaics. The City agrees to pay them 4,900 francs incurred to which it added 2,100 francs as reimbursement of expenses and allowances. They agree to move the mosaic within three months. A shed is then built to protect the pavement. Total transactions ultimately cost 7,535 francs and moving mosaic wait ... 1818 !
Acquired in 1813, the mosaic must still undergo some degradation: Depierre filled the ditches to protect the pavement from moisture and decide to close the field. These actions were reported to the mayor by Artaud 16 April 1814 and the next day the mayor wrote to Depierre requiring removal of the pavement. In 1815, Depierre reoffended and molested the guardian appointed by the mayor to monitor the field. They complained about not being able to pierce the streets in their field they plan to sell building lots. On 26 July 1817, within a fortnight Depierre threatened to continue the work they have already committed, the consequence would be the destruction of the ancient pavement. The prefect then made an order which prohibited Depierre to continue the work and forced them to surrender the land to the city agrees to move the mosaic.
It is still unknown what delayed the movement of the mosaic, a possible cause was the technical difficulties of the transfer. Artaud gives no explanation other than bad political circumstances. One known technique at that time, that moves Schneyder of a mosaic, if the cement is healthy, which seemed not to be the case since it has been altered by moisture. It was not until the process Belloni for the Lyons mosaic, starting with that of "Circus Games" could be moved. It will then be the turn of the mosaic "Cassaire" and the so-called "Michoud". Belloni, Director of the royal manufactory of mosaics Paris invented a method to move the tiles. The Comte de Fargues, Mayor of Lyon, teaches a method exists and tells the City Council that Mr. Belloni agrees to come to Lyon to transport the mosaic Palais Saint-Pierre for the sum of 6,000 francs. Parisian mosaic arrived in Lyon in early October 1818 and the work of displacement took place from October 8 to November 3. It takes eight months of work to restore the pavement in the workshop Belloni invites competent to check the parts of the mosaic before the removal person. This is done by the company and Company Widow Souplet. The museum will host Saint Peter mosaic on the floor of the Hall of Antiques while the inventory of 1833 falls in the Cabinet des Antiques, room at the southeast corner of the museum. The mosaic will eventually filed in December 1819 and January 1820. In 1835, Artaud says that the total cost of restoration and displacement reaches about 23,000 francs, far from the 6,000 francs that the Council had agreed in 1817.
In 1863, the movement of the mosaic is decided during the expansion of the museum on the current street Édouard-Herriot. The new location is chosen room antique casts, the first floor of the east wing. On 20 March 1870, the prefect decided to entrust a new restoration of the mosaic (as well as so-called "Children's Games") to Mora mosaic father and son. Mosaic circus games then joined the mosaic Cucherat or "Fish", present in the room antique casts since 1845. In 1921, during the drafting of the Revue du Lyonnais, the mosaic is still based in the same room at the Gallo-Roman Museum in Fourvière.
In 1975, the mosaic moved into the current museum.
Source problems
Artaud publishes three almost identical descriptions mosaic in two monographs in 1806 and in the book of 1835. Board drawn and engraved monograph illustrates the folio of 1806 and is followed by three detail images in the book of 1835. Several reproductions of mosaics, more or less happy, appear in subsequent publications, such as the History of the Romans Victor Duruy or in Gallia Camille Jullian . It must be admitted that only the board of Artaud represents the mosaic as it was found, without renovation. While admitting some interpretations, the first board presents the mosaic as it was in 1806, not one has Belloni in 1818 .
Description
Artaud gives the dimensions of the pavement in situ 5.035 × 3.086 m. After the second sitting in the hall of the Mummy Comarmond measuring 4.97 × 3 m, very close to modern dimensions.
Mosaic is rectangular. Its scope is black, polychrome decoration. From the exterior to the interior, the mosaic provides a framework consisting of a frieze of white teeth and a black border of three stones wide and again a wide white border of two stones. Then comes a great foliage leaving a cup placed on the left and whose lobes are filled with flowers with four petals, larger on the right of the mosaic decoration which results in a rich vegetable decoration side. Then comes a large white net three stones and a large continuous braid, again a white net three stones.
The decor has the central arena of a circus without the stands. On the left side is the delivery of tanks (carceres) topped by a box (pulvinar) forming the oppidum. It is structure which tends to prove that the mosaic image of the circus of the ancient city of Lugdunum, which corroborates the link with the epigraphy, including mention of the college of centonaires who financed the reconstruction of the circus after its wooden benches were burned.
The door through which leave the tanks, carried pompae, is surrounded by two pillars, one of which disappeared in a crack in the pavement that also hides a character we know only the head surmounted by a red cap and bears blue breeches. Perhaps this inspector game On both sides of the porta pompae carceres are eight, four on each side. Can provide some dating mosaic speculating a prior to the reign of Domitian, which establishes the use of six tanks, so carceres twelve, six back-to-six tanks and discharge. The lodge is occupied by three judges whose central characters, the sponsor of the show, holding the mappa, machine let loose to signify the start of the race.
Spina, massive central masonry around which the chariots turn, sharing the arena in its greatest length. It has two pools rectangular shape with the left features an obelisk. In the passage between the two basins are two characters. Lyon mosaic is remarkable in several respects (including the presence of three judges in the box), but the most intriguing is represented by the absence of these altars and other small temples that adorn the other known spinae as they are replaced here by basins. Each of the two basins present a set of pillars and architrave bearing the one seven balls and the other seven dolphins spouting water. These oval balls (or eggs) and these dolphins are lowered at every turn (curriculum).
Staff is on the edge of the track: a Sparsör ("sprinkler") holds a full bowl of water, it is responsible for watering the track, horses, and chariot wheels in case of overheating. In the corner, an agitator holds a whip, likely to excite the horses, and strength, perhaps intended to cut the reins of the horses in case of accident. A lonely rider straddles side runners, perhaps is it a flight attendant.

Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder, also Ludovicus van Beethoven, born Lodewijk van Beethoven (); (?) January 5, 1712 – December 24, 1773) was a professional singer and music director, best known as the grandfather of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven.
Family
The family name means "from (van) Bettenhoven".
A number of authors, such as Alexander Wheelock Thayer and Donald W. MacArdle in their book The Family van Beethoven, point to the fact that in 1712 two boys named Ludwig van Beethoven were born. The two families were distantly related.
Ludwig van Beethoven, born January 5, 1712 in Mechelen, son of Michael van Beethoven
Ludwig van Beethoven, born December 23, 1712 in Antwerp, son of Henry Adelard van Beethoven
They further write that it is not certain "which Ludwig" actually settled in Bonn in 1733. The first biographer of the composer Beethoven "made no attempt to trace their genealogy beyond their grandfather Ludwig".
The Ludwig van Beethoven from Mechelen, generally assumed to be Beethoven's grandfather, was the second son of master baker Michael van Beethoven (baptized February 15, 1684 in Mechelen, died June 28, 1749 in Bonn) and their wife Maria Louise Stuyckers (April 24, 1685, Mechelen – December 8, 1749, Bonn). Michael van Beethoven, besides the bakery trade, participated also in the local real estate market and in the purchase and sale of antique furniture and paintings.
Michael van Beethoven had three other children:
Kornelius van Beethoven (baptized September 25, 1708, Mechelen, died July 16, 1764, Bonn)
Ludwig van Beethoven (baptized June 23, 1710 in Mechelen, died September 22, 1710, Mechelen)
Lambert Michael van Beethoven (baptized July 25, 1715, Mechelen, died September 21, 1715 Mechelen)
Life
At the age of just six years Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder, having "a beautiful voice" was granted admission to the choir boys' seminar of the St. Rombout's Cathedral in Mechelen, effectively becoming a choirboy on December 10, 1717.
On October 12, 1725, they began studies under Anton Colfs, chief organist and carillonneur of St. Rumbold's Cathedral. Instruction focused on tablature and figured bass as well as the harpsichord and organ. No records exist of the years following the end of their apprenticeship in spring of 1727.
On November 9, 1731 Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder became a tenor singer at St. Peter's Church in Leuven; they are also mentioned as a substitute for the Kapellmeister. This appointment was probably promoted by Rombout van Kiel, a canon of the St. Peter's Church and former classmate of father Michael van Beethoven.
By September 2, 1732, Ludwig van Beethoven is registered as a bass singer at St. Lambert's Cathedral in Liège. This new appointment might be attributed to the support of Francois Stoupy, director of the Liège College in Leuven and friend of Rombout van Kiel.
In March 1733 Archbishop of Cologne and Prince-elector Clemens August of Bavaria summoned Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder to their court in Bonn after they had heard them sing in Liege, where Beethoven had been a substitute conductor. "Once Ludwig van Beethoven senior was established there, their destitute parents also fled to Bonn".
On November 17, 1733 Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder married Maria Josepha Poll (born Ball) (born about 1714, died September 30, 1775, Bonn). The marriage produced three children:
Maria Ludovica Bernhardine van Beethoven (baptized August 28, 1734, Bonn, died October 17, 1735, Bonn)
Mark Joseph van Beethoven (baptized April 25, 1736, Bonn, died unknown)
Johann van Beethoven (born November 14, 1740, probably in Bonn, died December 18, 1792, Bonn); father of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven
Initially the family resided in the former Jesuit college in Wenzelgasse, then in an estate, owned by master baker Fischer in Rheingasse 386 and finally in a coaching inn in Bonngasse 386, opposite the Beethoven-Haus, (Bonngasse 515).
Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder's long-cherished hopes of one day becoming Kapellmeister went unfulfilled in 1760 when a much younger colleague, Joseph Touchemoulin, got the assignment instead. Unlike the singer Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder, Touchemoulin was an experienced violinist and an accomplished composer.
Following the death of Archbishop Clemens August of Bavaria on February 6, 1761, their successor Maximilian Friedrich von Königsegg-Rothenfels immediately implemented strict austerity measures. Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder was made new Kapellmeister with the duties of singer and conductor combined. The disillusioned Touchemoulin consequently left Bonn to find work in Regensburg. As a separate occupation Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder maintained a wine trade business, which they had developed over the course of many years, exporting Rhine and Moselle wine to Flanders. Nothing is known about the volume, success and profitability of these undertakings.
Probably not unconnected with this, their wife was to become an alcoholic, which resulted in them being placed in a clinic until their death in 1775, and their son Johann was ultimately to descend into alcoholism as well.
Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder died from a stroke on December 24, 1773, in Bonn. Although they bequeathed debts to their son Johann, the father's inheritance of commodities bestowed on the son added up to a surplus.
Reception
Master baker Fischer described the appearance of Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder, of whom Amelius Radoux (1704 - c. 1773) had produced a contemporary oil portrait, as follows: "Stature of the court's Kapellmeister: A big beautiful man, learned man's face, broad forehead, round nose, large eyes, full red cheeks, very serious face". According to physician Franz Gerhard Wegeler, who later became a childhood friend of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven, Ludwig the Elder "was a small, vigorous man with extremely lively eyes".
Fischer and Wegeler describe them as a man with a serious and honorable character, diligent in professional practice and financial management, as well as being generally helpful and sociable.
Although their famous grandchild Ludwig van Beethoven was only three years old when Ludwig van Beethoven the Elder died, the younger Beethoven apparently had clear memories of their grandfather and developed a lasting love and admiration for him. In each of the countless times they changed lodgings during their years in Vienna, Beethoven would carry the Radoux oil portrait of their grandfather in person hurrying "to award it a place of honor" in the new home.

The 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec resulted in large-scale amalgamation of smaller municipalities in Quebec into larger cities. It was undertaken by one administration, and modified and partially undone by its successor.
The first phase involved many amalgamations from late 2000 until 2003, undertaken by the Parti Québécois government of Québec, headed by Premier Lucien Bouchard and their successor Bernard Landry. The most significant amalgamations, involving the largest cities in Quebec, mostly occurred on January 1, 2002. Some of the mergers were unpopular, and this became an issue in the April 14, 2003 Quebec election, in which the victorious Quebec Liberal Party led by Jean Charest campaigned on a promise to allow residents the right to choose to de-merge and reconstitute their former municipalities.
The new administration held referendums in various municipalities in 2004 to fulfill its campaign promise; however, a number of conditions were imposed, including a minimum voter participation threshold, which meant that not all merged municipalities held referendums and even fewer actually de-merged. The de-mergers that succeeded became effective on January 1, 2006. However, a new type of municipal structure, an urban agglomeration was created, which continued to tie the newly independent de-merged municipalities to their former amalgamation partners for the provision of certain municipal services.
The 2000–2003 municipal mergers were imposed on municipalities by the Québec government. In Canada, municipal governments are creatures of the provincial governments. However, a number of voluntary amalgamations (arranged by municipalities themselves) had taken place in the 1990s (see Municipal history of Quebec); these earlier amalgamations were not subject to de-merger referendums. Municipal amalgamations had been encouraged by the Quebec government on the grounds they would result in greater efficiencies and cost savings; critics disputed this. The government also cited the precedent of the 1998 amalgamation of Toronto and the 2001 amalgamation of Ottawa.
Merged cities
The following entities were created from these amalgamations:

Demerger referenda
After the 2003 election, the new Québec Liberal Party government led by Jean Charest adopted Bill 9, which created a formal process by which old municipalities could be reconstituted (in legal terms). Contrary to what was promised by Charest (full de-amalgamation), Bill 9 only restored specific powers to the demerged cities (e.g., animal control, garbage pickup, local street maintenance, some cultural facilities). The "bigger" expenses (e.g., police, fire, main streets, expansion programs) and the majority of the taxes remained in the hands of urban agglomerations, which are controlled by the central merged city because their larger populations give them greater voting weight. In Montreal, the de-amalgamated cities hold only 13% of the votes on the agglomeration council.
This consulting process about Bill 9 required 10% of voters residing within an amalgamated municipality to sign a petition to demand the holding of a referendum on de-amalgamation. To succeed, a referendum had to fulfill two conditions:
A majority must vote yes to de-amalgamation.
'Yes' voters must represent at least 35% of all registered electors.
Referendums were held on June 20, 2004 in 89 of the former municipalities of Québec. The 'Yes' vote recorded majorities in several municipalities, but did not reach the required threshold of 35% of registered voters. A total of 32 former municipalities met the conditions required to de-amalgamate and were re-established on January 1, 2006.
The demerging municipalities were:
From Montreal: Baie-D'Urfé, Beaconsfield, Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Dorval, Kirkland, L'Île-Dorval, Pointe-Claire, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue and Senneville in the West Island; Côte Saint-Luc, Hampstead, Mount Royal, Montreal West and Westmount in the West End; Montreal East in the East End
From Quebec City: L'Ancienne-Lorette and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures
From Longueuil: Boucherville, Brossard, Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville and Saint-Lambert
From La Tuque: La Bostonnais and Lac-Édouard
From Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine: Cap-aux-Meules and Grosse-Île
From Mont-Tremblant: Lac-Tremblant-Nord
From Rivière-Rouge: La Macaza
From Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts: Ivry-sur-le-Lac
From Mont-Laurier: Saint-Aimé-du-Lac-des-Îles
From Cookshire-Eaton: Newport
Additionally, Estérel voted to demerge from Sainte-Marguerite-Estérel, effectively reversing the merger between Estérel and Sainte-Marguerite-du-Lac-Masson. After the demerger came into effect, the city changed its name back to Sainte-Marguerite-du-Lac-Masson.

Robert Edward Townsend, Jr. (born September 13, 1943) is an American former competition swimmer, Pan American Games gold medalist, and former world record-holder.
Townsend won a gold medal as a member of the winning U.S. team in the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay at the 1963 Pan American Games. They participated in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where they swam for the gold medal-winning U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Under the 1964 Olympic swimming rules, they were ineligible for a medal, however, because they did not swim in the relay final.
Townsend attended Yale University, where they were a standout swimmer for coach Phil Moriarty's Yale Bulldogs swimming and diving team from 1963 to 1965. They won an NCAA national championship in the 400-yard individual medley (1963), and three more as a member of winning Yale teams in the 400-yard freestyle relay (1963, 1964, 1965).

Matthew Nwabueze Okoh (born May 19, 1972) is a former U.S.-Nigerian soccer player and currently assistant coach of the DSU Hornets Women. Their playing career spanned eight years and took them from the United States to Brazil, Germany and Portugal. Since retiring from playing, Okoh has devoted themselves to coaching collegiate soccer.
Playing career
Youth and college
While born in Washington, D.C., Okoh's family moved back to Asaba, Nigeria for several years. Their family then returned to the U.S., this time settling in Denver. Okoh attended Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado. After graduating from high school, Okoh remained in the Denver area, attending the University of Denver where they played men's soccer. They finished their collegiate career second on the team's career list of goals and points, having scored fifty goals in thirty-seven games. Okoh graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1995.
Early career
In 1995, Okoh signed with the Colorado Foxes of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) before moving to Brazilian club Santos that winter. They spent only half a season with Santos before returning to the U.S. to play the second half of the 1995–96 National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) season with the Wichita Wings.
Germany
In 1996, Okoh left the Wings and moved to Germany where they signed with German third division club SSV Reutlingen. Bundesliga club TSV 1860 Munich was suitably impressed with Okoh's performances and purchased their contract from Reutlingen. However, they lasted only one season, appearing in only two games, before transferring to SpVgg Unterhaching. They played the 1997–98 season with Unterhaching, scoring two goals in thirteen games before injuring their back in May 1998. This injury put them out of action for the remainder of the season and into the 1998–99 season. In December 1998, Okoh returned to the United States for rehabilitation. However, rehabilitation went slowly and they lost all of 1999. In January 2008, Okoh returned to Germany and joined the team of Bayern Hof in the Bayernliga. At the end of the 2007–08 season they quit.
Major League Soccer
In April 2000, Okoh went on trial with the Colorado Rapids. The team was sufficiently impressed with them to sign them as a discovery player. On March 19, 2001, the Colorado Rapids traded Okoh, along with Alan Woods and a second round 2002 draft pick to the New England Revolution for Imad Baba and Carlos Parra. The Revolution waived them on November 15, 2001.
Portugal
Following their release by New England, Okoh pursued a return to Europe. This led to them signing with Portuguese Second Division club S.C. Campomaiorense They spent the second half of the 2001–02 season in Portugal, then retired from playing professionally.
Return in Germany
In January 2008, they returned to Germany and made their debut for SpVgg Bavaria Hof in the Bayernliga. In July 2008, they moved to SC Baldham-Vaterstetten and left the team after half a year to sign a player-coaching contract with league rival SV-DJK Taufkirchen.
Coaching career
In 2000 while playing with the Rapids, Okoh joined the Colorado Legends Soccer Club as the Director of Player Development. At the same time, they served as an assistant coach to the University of Denver.
Then again in July 2001 while playing with the Revolution, Okoh was the head coach of the women's soccer team at Nichols College, a Division III college in Dudley, Massachusetts. They took the team to the finals of the Commonwealth Coast Conference Tournament before resigning in December 2001.
In 2002, Grambling State University hired Okoh to establish the school's first women's soccer team. In the Lady Tigers' first season, 2003, they coached the team to an 8–12–1 record. However, in 2004, they took the Lady Tigers to a 16–6 record. They resigned in January 2004 to pursue other coaching opportunities. That led to theirs being hired by Delaware State University in August 2005.
The Delaware Dynasty of the USL Premier Development League hired Okoh as its head coach on February 13, 2007.
In January 2008, they were named as assistant coach of SpVgg Bayern Hof, but left the team after six months. In January 2009, they became head coach of SV-DJK Taufkirchen. In July 2009, they signed a contract as assistant coach of DSU Hornets Women.

Marshallese Americans are Americans of Marshallese descent or Marshallese people naturalized in the United States. According to the 2010 census, 22,434 people of Marshallese origin lived in the United States at that time, though that number has likely grown significantly over the last decade. A recent estimate puts the number at approximately 30,000 in 2018. The United States has the highest concentration of Marshallese people outside the Marshall Islands. Most of these Marshallese people live in Hawaii and Arkansas, with significant populations in Washington, California, Oklahoma and Oregon.
History
In 1986, the Marshall Islands and the United States established an agreement called the Compact of Free Association, according to which the archipelago attained its full sovereignty. The treaty allows United States to provide defense, "social services and other benefits to the Marshall Islands" in exchange for military bases on the islands.
Under this treaty, Marshall Islanders can also travel and work in the United States without having visas, although they must be legal permanent residents and go through the same naturalization process equal to that of all other nationalities. Because they have the legal right to travel and work in the U.S., few Marshallese immigrants seek or attain citizenship.
Immigration from the Marshall Islands to the United States first began in the 1980s. Additionally, when numerous layoffs occurred in the Marshall Islands in 2000, there was a second wave of migration of Marshallese to the U.S.
Most of them emigrated to Hawaii and Arkansas when Tyson Foods, the largest poultry meat distributor in the world, employed numerous Marshallese people on the islands. Therefore many Marshallese employees were transferred and relocated to Springdale, Arkansas, to the corporate headquarters of Tyson Foods. John Moody, the first Marshallese settler in Arkansas, came there in the 1980s.
Many Marshallese emigrate to the United States to give their children an education, while other Marshalleses seek better working conditions or a better health system than the one found in their country.
Furthermore, since 1996 many Marshallese children have been adopted by American parents. Between 1996 and 1999, over 500 Marshallese children were adopted by American families. These adoptions are a result of social marginalization and economic poverty suffered by the population of the archipelago.
Adoptions were further driven by unethical trafficking schemes for which some perpetrators are facing prosecution.
Demography
Most Marshallese Americans reside in Hawaii and Arkansas. In 2020 it is estimated that some 15,000 Marshallese call Arkansas home. Most reside in Washington County, mainly in Springdale, home of Tyson Foods where many of them work. There are 7,400 living in Hawaii.
Other significant Marshallese populations include Spokane (Washington) and Costa Mesa (California). According to Karen Morrison, director of Spokane's Odyssey World International, a nonprofit that provides services for immigrants, Spokane County is home of a community of 2,400 or 3,000 people of Marshallese origin. In 2006 Spokane-area schools had a lot of Marshallese students, so that "Spokane Public Schools has 370 students whose primary language is Marshallese"; these students form the second group, more numerous than the Spanish-speaking students (360 people) and following the Russian-speaking students (530 people) in these schools (in reference to non-English languages).
The houses of the Marshallese of the USA house several generations of the same family and are sparsely furnished. In general terms, the population (which now has a western diet) has been adversely affected by diabetes, heart disease, tuberculosis, obesity, and COVID-19.
Many Marshallese are Baptist. The Marshallese Bible study group at Cross Church, a Baptist congregation in Springdale, has grown quickly in recent years, although the service is done mostly in English, since the church lacks ministers who speak fluent Marshallese.
Children born in the United States to Marshallese families have dual citizenship.

The following is a list of featured characters on The Mary Tyler Moore Show.
Main characters
Mary Richards
Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) is a single native Minnesotan who moves to Minneapolis in 1970 at age 30 and becomes associate producer of WJM-TV's Six O'Clock News. Them sincere, kind demeanor often acts as a foil for the personalities of their co-workers and friends.
Lou Grant
Lou Grant (Edward Asner) is the producer (later executive producer) of the news. Their tough, grumpy demeanor initially hides the kind-hearted nature gradually revealed as the series progresses.  They are referred to as "Lou" by everyone, including Mary's friends, with the exception of Mary herself, who can rarely bring themselves to call them by their first name rather than "Mr. Grant".  They are married to Edie, but during the run of the show they separate and divorce.
Murray Slaughter
Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod) is the head writer at fictional television station WJM-TV in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  They are assigned to write the news stories for the station's nightly news broadcast, and makes frequent quips about Ted Baxter's mangling of their news copy, and Sue Ann Nivens' aggressive, man-hungry attitude. Murray and Mary are the only characters to appear in every episode of the series.
Murray is happily married to Marie (Joyce Bulifant) and has several daughters. In the show's later years, they and Marie adopt a Vietnamese son. Although a happy family man, Murray is forever in love with Mary Richards, who is, in their words, "Absolutely terrific".  They are protective of them and always concerned for their happiness and well-being. At one point, when Murray truly believes they are in love with Mary in a real way, Marie thinks they are going to leave the family. Mary explains to Marie that they think of Murray as a best friend, which helps things settle down.
In a season three episode, it is revealed that Murray is a compulsive gambler. When a snowstorm necessitates the cancellation of a Las Vegas getaway, Lou arranges a poker game which Murray reluctantly joins.
Murray tries to write a novel; despite failing, they never gives up.
Murray, along with Mary, Lou Grant, and putative nemesis Sue Ann Nivens are fired from WJM-TV to boost sagging news ratings. Ironically, Ted, the one most responsible for the dismal ratings, is retained.
Ted Baxter
Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) is the dim-witted, vain, and miserly anchor of the Six O'Clock News. They frequently make mistakes and is oblivious to the actual nature of the topics covered on the show but, to cover for tormenting insecurity, they posture as the country's best news journalist.  They are often criticized by others, especially Murray and Lou, for their many shortcomings, but is never fired from their position. Initially a comic buffoon in the series, Ted's better nature is gradually revealed as the series unfolds, helped along by their sweet, seemingly vapid but frequently perceptive wife Georgette.
Rhoda Morgenstern
Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) (1970–1974) (Season 1–4, 6 & 7 Guest) is Mary's best friend and upstairs neighbor. They work as a window dresser, first at the fictional Bloomfield's Department Store, and later at Hempel's Department Store. Though insecure about their appearance, they are also outgoing and sardonic, often making wisecracks, frequently at their own expense. Like Mary, Rhoda is single. They date frequently, often joking about their disastrous dates. Rhoda moves to New York City and falls in love after the fourth season, leading to the spinoff series, Rhoda.
Phyllis Lindstrom
Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) (1970–1975) (Season 1–5, 7 Guest) is Mary's snobbish friend and neighbor. Phyllis is a recurring character appearing in many episodes of the first two seasons, after which their appearances decline in frequency.  They are married to unseen character Lars, a dermatologist, and has a precocious daughter, Bess (Lisa Gerritsen). Phyllis is controlling, egotistical and often arrogant.  They are actively involved in groups and clubs and is a political activist and a supporter of Women's Liberation. Rhoda and Phyllis are usually at odds and often trade insults. After appearing in three episodes of season five, Phyllis moves to spin-off Phyllis. In that series it is explained Phyllis has been widowed. Discovering that their husband had virtually no assets and that they must support herself, Phyllis returns to their home town of San Francisco.
Sue Ann Nivens
Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) (1973–1977) (Season 4–7), is the host of WJM's The Happy Homemaker show. While their demeanor is superficially cheerful, they make judgmental comments about Mary, exchanges personal insults with Murray, and uses many sexual double entendres, especially around Lou, to whom they are strongly attracted.
Recurring characters
Georgette Franklin Baxter is played by Georgia Engel. Georgette is the somewhat ditzy girlfriend (and later wife) of stentorian news anchor Ted Baxter (played by Ted Knight). Mary Tyler Moore described them as a cross between Stan Laurel and Marilyn Monroe. They and Mary get along fantastically, and they help fill the void that Phyllis Lindstrom and Rhoda leave in Mary's life when they leave for San Francisco and New York City, respectively.
Georgette first appears as a guest at one of Mary Richards' parties. They work as a window dresser at Hempel's Department Store in Minneapolis, Minnesota, along with Rhoda Morgenstern. Later, they work for a car rental service as a Golden Girl, and for Rhoda selling plants.
Georgette is devoted to Ted, and they eventually marry in Mary's apartment. They adopt a child named David (Robbie Rist), and later, Georgette gives birth to a girl named Mary Lou, also in Mary's apartment.
Edie Grant (née McKenzie) (Priscilla Morrill) is the wife of Lou Grant. They and Lou have been married for many years and have children, but in the 1971 episode "The Boss Isn't Coming to Dinner", marital difficulties lead to Lou and Edie separating. Though they reunite by the end of the episode, they again separate during The Mary Tyler Moore Show's fourth season, with the marriage ending soon thereafter. In a later season, Edie is remarried to Howard Gordon, and asks Lou and Mary to attend their wedding. Lou holds their peace and they part friends. Even when Lou lives in Los Angeles, they and Edie keep in touch because their grown daughters remain a common bond between them. In the Lou Grant series, Edie is revealed to be Roman Catholic and of Ukrainian heritage.
Gordon Howard, better known as Gordy, is played by actor John Amos. Gordy is the weather reporter on the nightly WJM-TV newscast. Affable, intelligent and professional, Gordy is the polar opposite of Ted. In 1973, Gordy leaves WJM, and eventually lands a job as host of a New York City talk show. Ted thinks this would be a great chance for them to become a national name, and wheedles Gordy to allow them to take part; but Gordy, although Ted's friend, is also wise to their ways, and gently refuses. After that, Gordy returns to New York and reaps success.
The producers introduced Gordy as a weatherman because of the dearth of black weathermen at that time. In several early episodes, the character of Gordy remarks, "Why does everyone think I'm the sportscaster?" Amos left the show for a starring role on Good Times. They later appeared as a guest star in an episode in 1977.
Bess Lindstrom is portrayed on both The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Phyllis by actor Lisa Gerritsen. Bess is the daughter and only child of Phyllis Lindstrom and late husband Lars. Bess helps their mother decorate the new apartment that Mary Richards moves into. Much to their mother's horror, Bess bonds well with Rhoda Morgenstern, calling them "Aunt Rhoda" (to which their mother invariably replies, "She's not your aunt"). Bess also bonds with Mary, an old friend of their mother's. They refer to Phyllis by their first name rather than with a motherly endearment.
Bess is featured more prominently on the spin-off show, Phyllis. By this time, Bess is in high school. They and their mother move to their mother's hometown, San Francisco, after their father dies. While Bess' step great-grandmother "Mother Dexter" despises Phyllis, they get along beautifully with Bess. Near the end of the series, Bess marries Mark Valenti (Craig Wasson), the nephew of Phyllis' boss, City Supervisor Carmen Valenti, and the couple are expecting a baby.
Florence Meredith, best known as Aunt Flo (actually a distant older cousin of Mary Richards), is played on a recurring basis by actor Eileen Heckart.  They are a straight-shooting newspaper columnist and winner of over sixteen journalism awards. They make infrequent visits to Minneapolis and also battles Mary's boss, Lou Grant. Although Flo and Lou clash, there's a spark between them and they have a brief fling. Flo later makes an appearance on Lou Grant, covering the same political campaign as Tribune reporter Billie Newman.
Martin and Ida Morgenstern are portrayed on both The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rhoda by veteran actors Harold Gould and Nancy Walker, respectively. They are the parents of Rhoda Morgenstern. Ida is portrayed as a stereotypical overbearing Jewish mother, whereas Martin is somewhat calmer and more even-keeled. While Rhoda is living in Minneapolis, Ida occasionally visits. When Rhoda moves back to New York, they initially stay with their mother in the Bronx. During the run of Rhoda, Martin and Ida separate when Martin goes off to find himself, pursuing a long-shelved dream of becoming a lounge singer. Toward the end of Rhoda's run, Martin returns and attempts to win Ida back, though this remains unresolved when the series ends.
Dottie and Walter Richards are Mary's parents. Dottie is played by veteran actor Nanette Fabray and Walter is played by Bill Quinn. Their first appearance is in 1972, two years after Mary leaves their fiancé and moved to Minneapolis. Them parents move to Minneapolis to be near Mary, though Mary and their mother, in particular, have a bit of trouble learning to relate to one another, now that Mary is an adult. The couple make a handful of appearances on the series that season before disappearing without explanation.
Marie Slaughter is played by Joyce Bulifant. Marie is the wife of newswriter Murray Slaughter and a homemaker. They and Murray have three daughters; they adopt a Vietnamese son toward the end of the series.

They broke up with them because of their obsession with them and overall overbearing nature. They appear at Mary's high school reunion, and also attends an impromptu cocktail party thrown by Mary and Rhoda. Mary also briefly dates Howard's much more low-key brother Paul, whose company they enjoy a bit more, but Howard and Paul's parents (Mary Jackson and Henry Jones) seem to favor Howard, and feel that Mary is being disloyal by dating Paul.

The Ampex ATR-100 is a multitrack tape recorder, designed by Ampex Corporation, of Redwood City, California, United States. It was introduced at the Spring 1976 AES Conference in Los Angeles, and was geared towards the ultra high end studio market. The original versions were designed specifically as a stereo or quadraphonic (2 or 4 track) mixdown and mastering deck. It has gained a reputation in the recording industry as the most accurate analogue tape recorder ever to be produced.
The ATR-100 was designed by a three-person design team consisting of Robert P. Harshberger Jr. (motors and control system), Alastair M. Heaslett (signal electronics) and Roger Sleger (mechanical systems).
Features and design
Key features of the design are the machine's interchangeable headblock system, which allows the ATR-100 to be converted to run either quarter-inch or half-inch magnetic tape. Ampex was the first company to implement a servo-controlled, direct-drive-capstan tape transport, which allows the tape speed and tension to be continuously monitored by a servo relay. The transport consequently has excellent wow and flutter specifications. The ATR-100 also features dual VU meters, or four VU meters in the case of the four track models, and a digital tape timer. An optional remote control is also available.
Upgrade
Approximately two years after the release of the ATR-100, Ampex released the next generation Ampex ATR-102, which was essentially the same machine as the ATR-100, with the exception of some repositioned components and slight design modifications.
Evolution
Following the success of the ATR-102, Ampex went on to release the 16-track Ampex ATR-116 and the 24-track Ampex ATR-124. Both machines were designed with the same transport and similar electronics. The Ampex ATR-124, though still widely regarded as the most accurate and best sounding multitrack ever produced, was a financial disaster for Ampex, resulting in only 62 being produced. Base price for these recorders in 1980 was $48,500 for the sixteen track machine and $62,500 for the 24 track machine. With additional components and customizations, either machine could easily reach over $100,000 in cost when it was originally released. Because of this, the Ampex ATR-124 is extremely rare, extremely expensive to service and maintain, and is referred to by many engineers as "The King of All Tape Machines."

David Chandler "Dave" Lyons (born January 23, 1943) is an American former competition swimmer and Pan American Games gold medalist.
Lyons earned a gold medal as a member of the first-place U.S. team in the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay at the 1963 Pan American Games. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, they swam for the gold medal-winning U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Under the 1964 Olympic rules they were ineligible to receive a medal, however, because they did swim in the event final.
Lyons began their competitive swimming at New Trier High School, Winnetka, Illinois. They were part of the high school national championship team in 1961. The team later placed third in the 1961 AAU championships. In 1961, they were the second swimmer to go under 1:50 for the 200-yard freestyle, Steve Clark of Yale doing it one day earlier. Lyons attended Yale University, where they swam for coach Phil Moriarty's Yale Bulldogs swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1963 to 1965. They won three consecutive NCAA national championships as a member of winning Yale teams in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Lyons later earned both M.B.A. and M.D. degrees.

Surface movement radar (SMR) is used to detect aircraft and vehicles on the surface of an airport. It is used by air traffic controllers to supplement visual observations. It may also be used at night time and during low visibility to monitor the movement of aircraft and vehicles. Surface movement radar is the term accepted by ICAO, but it has historically been known by other names such a ground movement radar, airport surface detection equipment (ASDE) and airfield surface movement indicator.
SMR is typically presented as a video blip, overlaid onto a plan view map of the airport showing features such as the runways and taxiways, grass areas and buildings. The SMR may be augmented by callsigns to identify each target, and provide warnings in the event of potential conflicts between aircraft on the runway (see AMASS). SMR also forms a key element of A-SMGCS.
SMR is required to provide high accuracy (typically 7.5 m), high update rate (1 per second), high resolution (less than 20 m) detection of airfield targets. To achieve this, SMR uses very short transmitter's pulse length of typically 40 nanoseconds. It uses a carrier-frequency in X-band (9 GHz) or Ku-band (15 to 17 GHz), and antennas with a very narrow beam (about 0.25 degrees in azimuth).

The black-and-white becard (Pachyramphus albogriseus) is a species of bird in the family Tityridae. It has traditionally been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggest it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee. It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

was a town formed in 1889 in Akashi District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. In July 1941 it merged into the Suma ward of Kobe. The town's boundaries at the time of the merger generally coincide with the current Tarumi ward of Kobe.
History
The name Tarumi literally means "sagging water", i.e. a waterfall, and refers to the waterfalls that were along the northern side of the road that stretched from eastern Tarumi beyond Shioya. The name is attested to in the Engishiki published in the tenth century.
On 1 April 1899 a new municipal system came into force and Tarumi village (垂水村) was formed from seven villages (Higashi-Tarumi, Yamada, Nishi-Tarumi, Tamon, Shioya, Shimohata and Myodani). In October 1928 the village became a town. In July 1941 the town merged into neighbouring Kobe city, becoming part of the Suma ward.

Vito Russo (July 11, 1946 – November 7, 1990) was an American LGBT activist, film historian, and author.  They are best remembered as the author of the book The Celluloid Closet (1981, revised edition 1987), described in The New York Times as "an essential reference book" on homosexuality in the US film industry. In 1985 they co-founded the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a media watchdog organization that strives to end anti-LGBT rhetoric, and advocates for LGBT inclusion in popular media.
Life and work
Vito Russo was born 1946 in East Harlem, Manhattan. Growing up Russo was disturbed by the stereotypical portrayals of gay people in media. After witnessing the Stonewall riot in 1969 and hearing about another raid the following year, Russo became avidly involved in the emerging Gay Activists Alliance.
Russo obtained their undergraduate degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University and earned their Master's in film at New York University. While earning their Master's, Russo also worked with the film departments at a Gay Community Center and New York's Museum of Modern Art. It was their interaction with these communities that led to the synthesis of their politics and works.
Russo developed their material following screenings of camp films shown as fundraisers for the Gay Activists Alliance. They traveled throughout the country from 1972 to 1982, delivering The Celluloid Closet as a live lecture presentation with film clips at colleges, universities, and small cinemas such as the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco and the Hirschfeld Biograph in Dublin. In both the book and in the lecture/film clip presentation, they related the history of gay and lesbian moments – and the treatment of gay and lesbian characters – in American and foreign films of the past.
In 1983, Russo wrote, produced, and hosted a series focusing on the gay community called Our Time for WNYC-TV public television, that was co-hosted by Marcia Pally. This series featured the nation's first GLBT hard news and documentary video segment produced and directed by social behaviorist D. S. Vanderbilt.
Russo's concern over how LGBT people were presented in the popular media led them to co-found the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), a watchdog group that monitors LGBT representation in the mainstream media and presents the annual GLAAD Media Awards. The Vito Russo Award is named in their memory and is presented to an openly gay or lesbian member of the media community for their outstanding contribution in combating homophobia. Russo was also actively involved in the AIDS direct action group ACT UP.
Russo appeared in the 1989 documentary Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt as a "storyteller," relating the life and death of their lover Jeffrey Sevcik. The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 62nd Academy Awards.
In 1990, Vito Russo spent a year in California at the University of California, Santa Cruz, teaching a class, also titled "The Celluloid Closet". They enjoyed being a professor, spending lecture breaks smoking and joking with their students.
Also in 1990, Merrill College at UC Santa Cruz established Vito Russo House to promote Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender awareness and provide a safe and comfortable living environment for queer, straight-supportive and all students who value and appreciate diversity. The house tailors its programming to meet the needs of LGBT students and offers all an opportunity to build understanding and tolerance.
Death and legacy
Russo was diagnosed with HIV in 1985, and died of AIDS-related complications in 1990. Their work was posthumously brought to television in the 1996 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, co-executive produced and narrated by Lily Tomlin. Their memorial was held at a Congregational Church.
They appeared in the film Voices from the Front, a feature-length documentary in 1991 on AIDS activism in America created by the video collective Testing the Limits.
After their death there was a memorial in Santa Cruz put on by students and colleagues. There were testimonials about how inspirational they had been and en masse, the group sang "Over the Rainbow" in their memory.
Russo's papers are held by the New York Public Library.
A family-approved biography of Russo's life, written by NYIT professor Michael Schiavi, titled Celluloid Activist: The Life and Times of Vito Russo was published by the University of Wisconsin Press in April 2011. A two-volume Vito Russo reader was published in July 2012 by White Crane Books titled Out Spoken: The Vito Russo Reader - Reel One and Out Spoken: The Vito Russo Reader - Reel Two. Reel One presents their film writings; Reel Two collects their political/social commentaries.
The documentary film Vito, had its festival premiere within the 2011 New York Film Festival went on to screen at the Maryland Film Festival, and had its television premiere on HBO on June 23, 2012. It is directed by Jeffrey Schwarz of the Los Angeles production company Automat Pictures.
In 2013, GLAAD named the "Vito Russo test" after him, a set of criteria intended to analyze the representation of LGBT characters in films.
In 2016, Russo was inducted into the Legacy Walk.
From 1969 until their death, they lived at 401 West 24th Street in Chelsea, Manhattan.
In June 2019, Russo was one of the inaugural 50 American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.
Season 1, episode 10 of the podcast Making Gay History is about him.

The Lady McLeod was a paddle steamer and a private local post. The ship sailed regularly between Port of Spain and San Fernando, on Trinidad island, now in Trinidad and Tobago from the end of 1845 until 1854. The private local post ran during the same time with the use of postage stamps on its mail from April 1847.
History
Coming from the Napier shipyard in Glasgow, the ship was christened in hommage of the Governor Sir Henry McLeod's wife and began its Port of Spain–San Fernando route in November 1845.
The 60-ton, 40 hp, steamer was bought by Turnbull, Stewart & Co. In 1846, David Bryce bought it and let it some years later to a San Fernando consortium.
At the beginning of the 1850s, the postal monopoly ended and American and Netherlands ships entered the competition. After a last purchase, the ship foundered near San Fernando in 1854. The Lady McLeod'''s bell was retrieved and has been regularly displayed by the Trinidad Philatelic Society.
Postage stamp
The private local post of the Lady McLeod began as soon as its service started in November 1845. There were two rates: a monthly subscription of one dollar, or ten cents per letter.
In April 1847, Bryce decided to introduce stamps that were sold individually for 5 cents, or for 4 cents if bought by the hundred. The Lady McLeod only transported letters bearing stamps, or pre-paid mail of the subscribers. The imperforate stamp's illustration was a white ship on a blue background, with the initials "LMc L" printed underneath. Lithographically printed, the stamp was cancelled by a cross drawn by hand or by ripping up a corner.
In 1851, the British colony issued its own stamps figuring a sitting Britannia.

Cranii or Kranioi or Krane () was a Greek city on the island of Cephallenia, situated at the head of a bay on the western coast. Thucydides writes extensively about Cranii in their History of the Peloponnesian War. In 431 BCE, it joined the Athenian alliance, together with the other Cephallenian towns; in consequence of which the Corinthians made a descent upon the territory of Cranii, but were repulsed with loss. In 421 BCE the Athenians settled at Cranii helot deserters of Sparta and the Messenians who were withdrawn from Pylos on the surrender of that fortress to the Lacedaemonians. As part of the negotiations with Sparta after the "50 Years Truce" was signed, these people were moved from their garrison at Pylos where they were involved in a blockade of the troops on the island in the bay of Pylos. They were relieved by Athenian troops who then garrisoned the bay. Cranii surrendered to the Romans without resistance in 189 BCE. It is mentioned both by Strabo and Pliny the Elder.
Its ruins are located near Argostoli. William Martin Leake, who visited in the 19th century, remarks that "the walls of Cranii are among the best extant specimens of the military architecture of the Greeks, and a curious example of their attention to strength of position in preference to other conveniences; for nothing can be more rugged or forbidding than the greater part of the site. The enclosure, which was of a quadrilateral form, and little, if at all, less than three miles (5 km) in circumference, followed the crests of several rocky summits, surrounding an elevated hollow which falls to the south-western extremity of the gulf of Argostóli." The walls may be traced in nearly their whole circumference.

Saint Evasius (; probably third century AD) is believed to have been a missionary and bishop of Asti, in north-west Italy. They were forced to flee to the great Padan forest known as the Selva Cornea, where they and numerous followers were beheaded by pagan, or alternatively by Arian, enemies in the area of what is now Casale Monferrato.  They are venerated as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church and is the patron of a number of towns in Piedmont and Lombardy. Their cult is liveliest at Casale, where their remains are conserved in the cathedral dedicated to him.
Life
No account of Evasius's life is regarded by scholars of hagiography as reliable. According to the Historia e vita di Sant'Evasio Vescovo e Martire by the Augustinian Fulgenzio Emiglio, published in 1708, they were born in Benevento, moved to Rome in 260 and was sent as a bishop to Asti in 265. There they suffered persecution at the hands of pagan opponents of Christianity and was forced to leave the town. The earliest account of the story, the anonymous Passio Sancti Evasii, which has been variously dated at early eleventh-century, tenth-century, and ninth-century, sets it in the times of the Lombard king Luitprand, who reigned during the years 712–744. In the versions deriving from the latter, Evasius's opponents were Lombard adherents of Arian Christianity, rather than pagans. Still, other accounts place their life during the fourth century and have them consecrated as Asti's first bishop around 330. Carbon dating of their relics (assuming that they are genuine) favors the third-century hypothesis.
It is said that following their flight from Asti, Evasius took refuge in the forest known as Selva Cornea along with two companions Proietto and Milano, and probably a third, Natale. At the site of today's Pozzo Sant'Evasio, near Casale, a miracle occurred. The bishop, tired from their journey, pushed their crozier into the ground and lay down to sleep. The pastoral staff set root and blossomed and a spring appeared at its foot.
Erasmus continued their work of conversion in Casale (then perhaps known as Sedula, or Sedalia), founded a small church dedicated to Lawrence the Deacon and attracted numerous followers. (The remains of such a church exist beneath the current cathedral.) In some accounts, they are identified as the first bishop of Casale.
Again, however, the saint attracted fierce opposition, and they were beheaded along with Proietto, Milano, and 143 companions, on the orders of the prefect (or duke or sculdascio) Atubolo. Skeletal analysis of their remains suggests that Evasius died at about the age of 60.
In the version of their life which sets it in the third century, the date of Evasius's martyrdom is given as 1 December 292, during the reign of Diocletian, whose later persecution of Christians is well known. For the version of the story which places it in the first part of the eighth century, the context is that of the struggle between those Lombards who remained attached to their Arian beliefs and the soon-to-be-victorious Trinitarian new guard, associated particularly with the Catholic Theodolinda who had been Lombard queen from 588 to 628, and to which King Luitprand belonged.
Legacy
Saint Natale is held to have escaped the massacre and to have become a priest of the church which was newly dedicated to Evasius and in which their remains were sepulchered. At the same time the church was perhaps rebuilt on a larger scale with the support of Luitprand.
Casale, now itself named after the saint as "Casale di Sant'Evasio", grew up around the church during the middle ages. A new and much larger church was consecrated by Pope Paschal II in 1107.
In 1215 Ghibelline Casale was sacked by the anti-Imperial forces of Alessandria and Vercelli together with the support of Milan. The saint's remains were removed to Alessandria along with another booty. In 1403 Casalese condottiere Facino Cane brought the relics back from Alessandria, following a military victory over that town.
The church of Sant'Evasio became a cathedral with the establishment of the Diocese of Casale in 1474.
At Pozzo Sant'Evasio (literally "Saint Evasius's Well") in 1670 a church was erected over the miraculous spring, which had been turned into a well whose waters were reputed to cure diseases.
Feast days
Evasius's feast day was entered into the Roman Martyrology as 1 December, and it is on that day that they are celebrated in Asti.  They are also the patron saint of Rocchetta Palafea in the Langhe, of Pedrengo in the Province of Bergamo (who were given some relics—part of a leg, and a bone from the foot—in 1609), and of Bizzarone in the Province of Como.
In Casale Monferrato in the Province of Alessandria, they are the patron saint both of the Diocese and of the Commune. Here their feast is kept on 12 November in memory of the day on which Facino Cane returned the relics to the town.

The Valentino Orchestra is a Canadian 17-piece pre-swing style big band formed in Montreal in 1996 and led by musicologist and composer Andrew Homzy. Gerald Danovitch was the lead alto player until they died in 1997.
The Valentino Orchestra—named after Rudolph Valentino—bases its repertoire of "sophisticated swing" on the American popular music—compositions by Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Hoagy Carmichael, and the many others who in the Jazz Age established what is often called the Great American Songbook. Most of the music performed by the band was drawn stylistically from the period between the two world wars, and performed accordingly: often with exaggerated "old style" pre-swing era rhythm.
The band performs the original musical settings of these songs: the arrangements that were written for the dance bands and hotel orchestras of the 1920s and 1930s, complete with the string section: two violins and a viola.
History
In 1995, jazz musicologist, composer, and arranger Andrew Homzy, together with music educator and bass player George Doxas, invited saxophonist Gerald Danovitch to start a pre-swing era jazz band. Homzy introduced their large collection of Duke Ellington stock arrangements. George Doxas and Gerald Danovitch invited several friends and students to try the sound of this vintage jazz project. Danovitch at first was designated to supervise the rehearsals, as they had the most practical expertise in performing the music of 20s and 30s, but later Danovitch led the saxophone section.
After months of rehearsal led by Homzy, the band started to record in George Doxas's home studio. The recording was an experiment which attracted the attention of Justin Time Records. After releasing their first album, My Foolish Heart, the band was invited to perform at many venues.
The Valentino Orchestra performed at the du Maurier stage of the Montreal International Jazz Festival in 1997 and 1998 in front of 50,000 people and on other stages in 1999 and 2002. They also performed in Ottawa in 1998.

The IAFL College Bowl was a college football tournament that formed part of the Irish American Football League between 2007 and 2011. Four teams competed in the championship since its inauguration: the UL Vikings, the DCU Saints, Trinity College, and UCD. The final champions were Trinity College, having defeating UCD 7-0 in December 2011.
The Bowl was discontinued after the 2011 edition as all four collegiate members of the league now compete in the South division of the Shamrock Bowl Conference.
History
Initially, the championship was a single game which formed part of the 2007 and 2008 IAFL seasons. The UL Vikings were twice victorious, defeating the DCU Saints by scores of 50-2 and 47-12. In 2009, the Championship became a four-team tournament with the addition of Trinity College and UCD. The Vikings were again successful, defeating the Saints in the final.
In 2010, Trinity College captured the Championship for the first time in spectacular fashion. Facing the UL Vikings in Limerick, the game finished 12-6 after triple overtime (7 quarters) and 3 hours and 45 minutes of play; an IAFL record for match length. The victory was sealed in the third quarter of overtime with a touchdown from Rob McDowell. Linebacker Stephen Carton was named game MVP. The club retained their title in 2011, defeating UCD by a margin of 7-0.

Charles "Buck" McGovern (March 6, 1873 – August 29, 1962) was a Pennsylvania law enforcement officer, soldier, and politician best known for their role in the 1902 recapture of the condemned Biddle brothers after their escape from prison.
An obituary called them a "rambunctious warhorse of the Republican Party in Pittsburgh [whose] 50-year career had carried them to far continents and through a thousand-and-one battles as a politician, Rough Rider, two-gun police officer and detective."
The Biddle Brothers episode served as a springboard for McGovern's later political career. They served in a private capacity to Theodore Roosevelt during the presidential campaign of 1912. After serving in the cavalry during World War I, patrolling the border and participating in the Battle of Ciudad Juarez, McGovern was chosen as the Chief of the Pittsburgh City Detective Bureau in 1922. They resigned this position soon after in order to help with the election campaign of Governor Gifford Pinchot. The next year they were chosen as a State Department of Justice special agent, and from 1927-1935 they served as an Allegheny County Commissioner. An avid historian, McGovern also hosted a longstanding weekly radio program on WJAS Pittsburgh throughout the 1930s and 1940s.
McGovern died on August 29, 1962, and was buried in Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

Jonathan M. Butler (born 1945) was a historian of religion. They were formerly employed as a lecturer by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
Biography
Jonathan Butler earned a BA in religion at La Sierra College (1967) and an M.Div. at Andrews University before completing their doctorate at the University of Chicago (1975).
They worked as an associate professor of church history at Loma Linda University in California, and also taught at Union College in Nebraska. They were co-editor of the magazine Adventist Heritage.
Other historians have praised their historical writing. The authors of Seeking a Sanctuary describe:
The most valuable contribution to the study of the denomination's formative period is still Jonathan M. Butler's landmark essay, "Adventism and the American Experience," [...]
They authored an article in 1979 claiming Ellen White's endtime scenario was culturally conditioned to the point of being more at place in their time than now. Walter Rea describes it as "a brilliant piece," which "sent shock waves through the church".
Yet like numerous other authors, the church found their writings on White and other history challenging and difficult to cope with officially. They claimed, "many of the names identified with advances in Ellen White studies" (including himself) are no longer in church employment, "and most of them are no longer active church members." Butler later stopped working as an academic historian.
Publications
Butler has authored publications on the debate over the inspiration of Ellen White, charismatic experiences in early Adventism (see: charismatic Adventism), and others.

Shadow Play is a 1986 American supernatural horror film directed by Susan Shadburne and starring Dee Wallace and Cloris Leachman. It follows a playwright who lost their fiancé seven years prior. They begin having reoccurring dreams about their death and suffers from writer's block. The film centers around the lighthouse where the tragedy took place. Throughout the film there are many subtle lighthouse effects and references. The Shadow Play within the story itself is literally a timing of each beat after another on the spinning of the beacon light of the lantern room.
Plot
Morgan Hanna wakes up in the middle of the night after having nightmares involving the sudden death of their fiancé Jeremy, seven years ago. Struggling to write a comical play and struggling to find inspiration, they talk to a therapist who informs them that this is all just beginning. In their wisdom they express that it's not over judging by the way they are still heavily affected by their death. The nightmares continue to haunt them
After receiving a heartfelt letter from their would-be mother-in-law inviting them back to the Northwest where the tragedy took place, Morgan opts to face what she's running away from and stays with Jeremy's mother who is also affected by their death as well as their own husband's death. While settling in, Morgan begins to formulate a play about the loss of their beloved and the text takes on an almost supernatural tone. Morgan begins to see Jeremy's reflection in windows and mirrors.
Jeremy's brother John still confirms that Jeremy took their own life as they were the only one present when Jeremy fell from the lighthouse. Everyone has been made to believe that is what happened.
The five actors who read for the play are all playing different parts of the same character. At first the character appears to be Morgan herself, but as it progresses it becomes more the character of Jeremy from beyond. Jeremy is the one writing the play from beyond the grave.
As the underlying drama unfolds, Morgan begins to unravel thinking they are losing their mind. As the play progresses it takes on a far more supernatural tone and John uses their vulnerability to seduce them while Jeremy uses John's body to be with Morgan again. Morgan becomes even more distraught and finally breaks down. Submitting to the idea of joining Jeremy to end their pain.  They are determined to finish the play, and the ending takes on the meaning that they will end their own life as they believed Jeremy had done. They hand the finished script to their five actors and sits through the full reading of the play. Satisfied and moved by the performance, they head for the lighthouse to jump to their death. John follows her, desperate to stop them As John tries to explain that Jeremy wouldn't want this, they start to stir from their catatonic state. They tell them that Jeremy never took their own life and that they didn't fail him. That it was truly an accident that they caused when they attempted to take their own life and Jeremy fell in the process of trying to stop them from jumping.
Now fully aware that everything they were led to believe was a lie and that they aren't at fault, their own spirit is freed in a sense. They flee from the lighthouse, relieved of years in doubt. With a newfound resolution, they tell their agent over the phone that they are returning home. Waiting for them in their room is Jeremy's last words to them from beyond. Telling Morgan to be free and happy.

The Jarvis Street Baptist Church is a Baptist church located at the intersection of Gerrard Street and Jarvis Street in downtown Toronto. One of the oldest churches in the city, its congregation was founded in 1818, and the present church constructed in 1875.
History
Early records indicate that by 1827, church meetings were held at the Masonic Hall on Colborne Street. The congregation then bought property on Lombard Street and constructed a small chapel in 1832. It was then known also as the Baptist Church of York. By 1848, the congregation had moved to Bond Street and became known simply as Bond Street Baptist Church with a membership that grew to 400 by the late 1860s. Beginning with Bond Street and continuing through at Jarvis Street an outreach was begun further west which was established in 1880 as Beverley Street Baptist Church. (See also Toronto Chinese Baptist Church.)
The present church was erected on Jarvis Street in 1875, with a large donation to the construction costs from the Canadian Senator and banker, William McMaster. The newly formed Baptist Union of Canada held its first meeting at Jarvis Street in October 1880.
In 1882, William McMaster, William Elliot (a member of Jarvis Street and a Toronto pharmacist and business person), and others established the Standard Publishing Company, which published the Canadian Baptist, transferring that enterprise from private ownership to a denominational enterprise.
"In 1888 the Western Convention, while in session in Jarvis St. Church, Toronto, passed the following resolution: Whereas this question of Union has been carefully considered, both by the Society in the East and by us, therefore, resolved, that we do now receive the Eastern Society into union with us.
The new convention was to be called, 'the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec.' " Less than 40 years later the same Convention passed a resolution calling for the dismissal of Jarvis St. and a number of other like-minded congregations during the "Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy".
From 1925 until 1943, the church owned and operated a radio station in Toronto under the call letters CJBC. The station went off the air when the federal government terminated all religious radio licenses. The station is unrelated to the current CJBC which is the French-language station owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Pastors
The congregation's past ministers include John Harvard Castle (1830–1890), who became pastor in 1873 (while at Bond St.) and later played an instrumental role in founding the Toronto Baptist College (later McMaster) serving as its first President and Professor of Systematic Theology and Christian Ethics. Benjamin Daniel Thomas (1843–1917) served from October 1881 to July 1903 and was once referred to as "the best-loved Baptist minister in Canada." Henry Francis Perry (1861–?) served from 1903 to 1909, leaving for a pastorate at First Baptist Church Vancouver, British Columbia. During their pastorate they also taught at McMaster. They were followed by Thomas Todhunter Shields who held the pastorate from 1910 until their death in 1955. It was during Shields' tenure that a disastrous fire severely damaged the building in 1938. Shields supervised the rebuilding and insisted that the new spire be an exact replica of the old one.

Architecture
The Jarvis Street Baptist Church was designed in the Gothic Revival style by the architectural firm of Henry Langley and Edmund Burke who served for many years at Jarvis Street Baptist Church as a Sunday-school teacher, chair of the choir committee, and deacon. It was one of the first churches in Canada to be built with an amphitheatre-shaped interior. The ground floor seating is grouped in a semicircle, while the gallery above is horseshoe shaped.
The main façade of the building is made out brown stone that is obtained from the regions of Queenstown. The stone is laid unevenly with a pattern that varies in different shades of browns and dark yellows. The material used for the roof is Canadian slate. The roof is constructed from a series of pitched segments that are centrally connected by a horizontally sliced dome. There are eight entrances, each consisting of solid oak double doors framed with pointed sandstone arches. Several of these doors have been blocked off with black cast iron gates. Triangular sets of small rosette windows are placed above every door to fill the space in between the entrance and the top of the arch. The building has the number of columns with slim tall shape and different capitals that are loosely based on a Corinthian order. The capitals are made of gray stone while the columns are of a high quality bronze shaded granite found in St. George, New Brunswick. The main entrance is set under the only tower of the building facing the south west side which serves as a vertical axis to the building. A copper spire sits on top of the tower, adding approximately to the existing roof height. In addition to the vertical axis the building also has a horizontal symmetry axis that goes diagonally through the building. The flat-roofed extension of the church, built after the 1938 fire, was constructed with red brick masonry which contrasts with the charred Queenston façade.
Tall, thin arched windows cover the walls of the church, with the exception of the extension building whose windows are rectangular. The windows are divided into squares and diamonds of yellow and colourless textured glass. Many of the windows are aligned with one another. However a few of the smaller windows are offset to form a step-like pattern. The white wood framing of the windows contrasts with the colourful exterior stone. The building is heavily decorated with ornaments at the top of every pitched roof and throughout the spire. Gargoyles align with the entrance doors, and rippled arches are engraved in the building.
The church has been protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 1999. The designation notes that it was designed by Langley & Burke. The by-law notes that alterations made in 1938–1939 after a fire were designed by Horwood and White, architects. The text also notes: "[The] Jarvis Street Baptist Church was the first church in Canada designed with a U-shaped galleried
auditorium, described by J. R. Robertson as 'the more modern method of seating which bends the
audience around the chancel' ".
Context
The building is situated in the centre of a group of fast food restaurants, corner stores, apartment buildings, and townhouses. It is the neighbour of the Allan Gardens Park as well as Grace Toronto Church (originally Old St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church). The interior of St. Andrew's, also designed by Langley and Burke, is said to resemble that of the original Jarvis Street Baptist Church. In comparison to its surroundings the building is very large on both vertical and horizontal planes. At the time of construction it was very likely one of the tallest buildings in the area.
Jarvis Street Baptist Church in the 21st century
According to the church's pastor, the congregation adheres in principle to a Calvinistic Baptist theology. It is a member of the Sovereign Grace Fellowship of Canada. The Toronto Baptist Seminary and Bible College is adjacent to the church, and closely associated with it.
In addition to community worship, visitation and prayer meetings, the church hosts a variety of study groups, fellowships and activities including a Bible school for all ages, English as a second language (ESL) Bible studies, college and careers seminars, the Kidz club for 5–17 year-olds, and women's and couples' fellowships, street evangelism. The church also has its own library known as the Bookroom. Jarvis Street Baptist Church Sunday morning services are broadcast on WDCX-FM.

Linnaea amabilis, also known under the synonym Kolkwitzia amabilis and the English name beauty bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Caprifoliaceae. It is a deciduous shrub grown as an ornamental plant. In China, where it originated, the plant is called wèi shí (蝟实).
Description
The plant is an arching, spreading shrub, with light brown flaky bark and graceful arching branches, which can grow higher than tall. It is usually as wide as it is tall. The plant blooms in late spring. Its light pink flowers, dark pink in the bud, are about one-inch long and bell-shaped ("tubular campanulate"); they grow in pairs, as with all Caprifoliaceae, and form showy, numerous sprays along ripened wood. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, from long, entire or with a few sparse shallow teeth. Its fruit is a hairy, ovoid capsule approximately inches long.
Taxonomy
The species was first described by Paul Graebner and placed in their new genus, Kolkwitzia, whose name honours Richard Kolkwitz, a professor of botany in Berlin. The specific epithet amabilis means "lovely". In 2013, it was suggested that Kolkwitzia, along with the genera Abelia, Diabelia, Dipelta and Vesalea, be merged into an expanded genus Linnaea.
History
The beauty bush originates in Central China, where it has been discovered for western science twice; once by the Jesuit missionary Giuseppe Giraldi in Shensi, and then in western Hubei province by the British explorer and plant collector E.H. Wilson. Wilson sent plant material to their sponsors Veitch Nurseries in Exeter in 1901, where the shrub flowered for the first time in 1910. The shrub became very popular in the eastern United States following World War I – almost a defining shrub in American gardens made between the World Wars. It is very rare and threatened in the wild.
Cultivation
Numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use. Under the synonym Kolkwitzia amabilis the cultivar ‘Pink Cloud' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Pruning
Opinions differ concerning how much pruning the shrub needs. The University of Missouri Horticulture Department suggests minimal intervention, so long as the plant has enough room to develop, up to a maximum height of and a potential "spread" of . Others suggest more active intervention to encourage development of new flowering branches and buds, with decisive pruning immediately after flowering.

The Illinois Northern Railroad was an industrial switching railroad serving Chicago's southwest side. From their yard at 26th St. and Western Ave. the line went southwest to the Santa Fe (now BNSF) Railway's Corwith Yard, connecting with most major area railroads and serving on-line customers on the way. They also leased and switched track east of their yard. Incorporated in 1901, it was merged into the Santa Fe Railway in 1975.
History
The Illinois Northern Railroad was incorporated in 1901 by the McCormick Reaper Company (merged into the new International Harvester Co. in 1902). It was used primarily to switch their McCormick Plant and later Tractor Factory. This let them control any traffic that served the factories.
After 1945 International Harvester started moving production from the two old factories to other locations and sold the Illinois Northern to four railroads. The Santa Fe bought a controlling 51%, 25% was bought by the Burlington, and the New York Central Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad each bought 12%.
On February 16, 1975 the Illinois Northern was merged into the Santa Fe.
In 2000 the Central Illinois Railroad was incorporated to operate the Illinois Northern route and some BNSF track east, in 2010 they went out of business and the BNSF resumed operating the line until it was closed.
Trackage
The main line ran west along the south side of 26th St., sometimes elevated, from Western Ave. to Sacramento Ave., where it turned southwest. At Central Park Ave. and 32nd St. the line turned south, crossed the Chicago Sanitary Canal on a swing bridge, and then into the Santa Fe's Corwith Yard. This section was leased from the Santa Fe Railroad.}
A yard with a freight house and engine servicing facilities was at the southwest corner of Western Ave. and 26th St. Immediately west, across a major north-south rail corridor, was the 26th St. switch yard. Connections to the north-south corridor were made here. Later the International Harvester Tractor Factory was built south of this yard.
There were a number of on-line businesses on the diagonal section between Sacramento Ave. and Central Park Ave. Then the north and south section made connections with several main rail lines from the north end of their 33rd St. switch yard. Then the line crossed the Chicago Sanitary Canal on a twin-track through-truss swinging bridge. South of the bridge the line made connections with two railroads and then entered the Corwith Yard.
The McCormick Works, the primary reason the railroad was incorporated, was just east of the service yard on the southeast corner of Western Ave. and Blue Island Ave. (a diagonal street which ends at 26th St. and Western Ave.). The McCormick complex had both mainline and switching tracks. The Illinois Northern leased a short distance of main and yard track northeast along Blue Island Ave. between Western Ave. and Hoyne Ave. from the Burlington Railroad (now BNSF Railway).
East of Hoyne Ave. the Illinois Northern had trackage rights on the Burlington line along Blue Island Ave. to Lincoln (now Wolcott) Ave.
As of 2020 no track between Western Ave. and the Sanitary Canal remained but some of the former Burlington tracks along Blue Island Ave. may still be in service.
Equipment
As a switching line the Illinois Northern never owned a road locomotive. In 1910 they owned six steam switching locomotives of the 0-6-0 type. In 1950 and 1951 they bought six Alco S4 B-B diesel locomotives, #29-#34. After being merged into the Santa Fe in 1975 Santa Fe (then BNSF) locomotives were used.
In 1910 The Illinois Northern owned forty-eight revenue cars, thirty box cars and eighteen gondolas. In 1930 they owned sixty-two revenue cars. In 1971 they only owned three cabooses and two service cars.

Robert Warington, Jr. (22 August 1838, Spitalfields, London – 20 March 1907, Harpenden) was an English agricultural chemist, known for their research and publications on the chemistry of phosphates and nitrates in agricultural soils.
Biography
Robert Warington Jr. was the eldest son and second child of the chemist Robert Warington, FRS. After studying chemistry in their father's laboratory and attending lectures by Faraday, Brande, and Hofmann, Robert Warington Jr. became in 1859 an unpaid assistant to Sir John Bennet Lawes at Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden. Warington was from 1862 to 1867 an assistant to the Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester.
They were from 1876 to 1891 an investigator at Rothamsted Experimental Stations, where they published many articles on soil nitrification. R. Warington here made the first observation that nitrification is a two-step process in 1879.
In 1891 Warington was appointed by the committee for the Lawes Agricultural Trust to give six lectures in the United States before the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experimental Stations at Washington, D.C. from August 12 to 18, 1891. The lectures dealt mainly with the subject of soil nitrification, based upon their own research at Rothamsted. When they returned to England, they did research at Lawes's Millwall laboratory. They were appointed in 1894 as an examiner in agriculture for the science and art department of the University of Oxford and was for three years, from 1894 to 1897, the Sibthorpian professor of rural economy at the University of Oxford.
They were elected in 1863 a Fellow of the Chemical Society and in 1886 a Fellow of the Royal Society.
In 1884 Robert Warrington Jr. married Helen Louisa (1855–1898), third daughter of George H. Makins, M.R.C.S., chief assayer to the Bank of England. Robert Warington Jr. and their first wife had five daughters: Elizabeth (Betty) born in 1888; Margaret born in 1890; Dorothy, born in 1892; and twins, Katherine and Helen (Kitty and Nell) born in 1897. In 1902 they married Rosa Jane, daughter of Frederick Robert Spackman, M.D., of Harpenden. Katherine Warington (1897–1993) became a famous botanist. Robert Warington Jr is buried with many of their family in a family plot in St Nicholas Churchyard, Harpenden, England.

A tiger tail donut (also called tiger tail doughnut or simply tiger tail) is a donut that is twisted with another ingredient so that it looks like the tail of a tiger. This other ingredient may vary; examples include chocolate; chocolate-flavoured dough; a combination of chocolate and cinnamon; and a combination of cinnamon, apples, and coconut. The tiger tail is the second most popular donut at The Donut Man in Glendora, California, United States, surpassed only by the shop's signature donut: the strawberry donut. In 2010, Dunkin' Donuts locations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, sold tiger tails to celebrate the Year of the Tiger. Erin Allday of The Press Democrat called the tiger tail the "most unusual donut" at the Donut Hut in Santa Rosa, California.

Ramla Redoubt (), also known as Vendôme Redoubt (), was a redoubt in Ramla Bay, limits of Xagħra on the island of Gozo, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715–1716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The redoubt no longer exists, but a small part of its foundations are still visible.
History
Ramla Redoubt was built in 1715–1716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries and redoubts in Malta. It was located in the centre of Ramla Bay. The bay included other fortifications, namely Ramla Left Battery and Ramla Right Battery on the other side of the bay, and an entrenchment wall linking both batteries with the redoubt. Ramla Bay was further defended by Marsalforn Tower on the plateau above the bay, and an underwater barrier to prevent enemy ships from landing within the bay.
The redoubt originally consisted of a pentagonal platform with a low parapet. A rectangular blockhouse was located at the centre of its gorge.
In 1881, a statue of the Madonna was built on the site of the redoubt.
Present day
Today, all that remains of the redoubt is a small section of its pentagonal platform near the base of the 19th century statue. These remains, along with the rest of Ramla Bay, are managed by the Gaia Foundation.

Harold Frederick Loomis (December 23, 1896 – July 5, 1976) was an American botanist and myriapodologist known for their contributions to agronomy, plant pathology, and millipede taxonomy. They worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture for over four decades, studying diseases of crop plants, and was a colleague of Orator F. Cook. They also made major contributions to the natural history of Central America and the West Indies, naming over 500 species of millipedes in total. They co-described with Cook the leggiest animal on earth: Illacme plenipes, with over 700 legs.
Biography
Harold Loomis was born in the Mertensia neighborhood of Farmington, New York, in 1896. They worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1914 until their retirement in 1958, some 44 years, and was director of the U.S. Plant Introduction Station at Chapman Field, from 1931 to 1958. They were primarily involved in the production of natural rubber, and also worked on diseases of corn and cotton. They were a charter member of the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, and served many years on its board of directors. They also collected plants and lichen from the American southwest, often contributing specimens along with botanist Robert Hibbs Peebles. in 1939 Loomis described the tropical palm tree Astrocaryum alatum ("Coquillo").
Their other area of research was in arthropods. Loomis was an honorary research fellow in entomology at the Smithsonian Institution, and an active research collaborator with the National Museum of Natural History, and Florida State Collection of Arthropods in Gainesville. Early in their career they began working with fellow botanist/entomologist Orator F. Cook. In 1919 Loomis accompanied Cook on an expedition to China to study crops as well as collect millipedes, and in 1928 Loomis and Cook described the millipede with the greatest number of legs known, Illacme plenipes of California. With individuals possessing up to 750 legs (375 pairs), Illacme has more legs than any animal known. Loomis later described another species from Panama with 700 legs.
Loomis's specialty was in the millipedes of Central America and the Caribbean, and over their career they named more than 500 species, at least 127 new genera, 2 new subfamilies, and 9 new families, including Messicobolidae, Tingupidae, and Tridontomidae, with only a few taxa named with co-authors. They produced 64 scientific papers on arthropods and 50 on millipedes. The eminent myriapodologist Richard L. Hoffman wrote of Loomis: "(H)is monographs on the faunas of Hispaniola (1936) and Panama (1964) stand out as oases in a desert of chaotic short descriptive papers. Their 1968 checklist of the Mesamerican species is beyond praise for its fundamental reference value." In terms of numbers of species described, Loomis ranks as one of the ten most prolific millipede taxonomists in history.

New York State Route 37B (NY 37B) is an east–west state highway located in St. Lawrence County, New York, in the United States. It serves as a business route of NY 37 through the village of Massena. While NY 37B enters the village, NY 37 bypasses it to the south. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 37 in the town of Louisville. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 37 just east of the village limits in the town of Massena. NY 37B intersects North Main Street, a state-maintained northward extension of NY 420, in Massena's central district.
The origins of NY 37B date back to the early 20th century when the New York State Legislature created Route 32, an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Massena. From Waddington to Massena, Route 32 followed River Road and Town Line Road. This portion of the route became part of NY 3 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Waddington–Massena segment of NY 3 became NY 37B. The route was extended east into Massena in the 1950s after NY 37 was realigned to follow a new bypass around the village.
Most of NY 37B west of Massena ran through a low-lying area along the St. Lawrence River. In 1958, this area was permanently indundated as part of the St. Lawrence Seaway's construction. As a result, NY 37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake St. Lawrence to meet NY 37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY 37 and NY 37B in Louisville was designated as NY 131 by 1960. The alignments of NY 37B and NY 131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY 37B on its modern alignment.
Route description
NY 37B begins at an intersection with its parent route, NY 37, in the town of Louisville. The route heads to the northeast, paralleling the Grasse River as it passes a small number of homes and businesses located in the otherwise rural town. There are small patches of forested areas along the way to the Massena village line (and the town's line of the same name), where it intersects with Town Line Road (County Route 43). Once in Massena, the amount of development along the highway begins to increase. NY 37B, now known as Maple Street, continues northeast through Massena for three blocks before veering eastward upon passing Massena Memorial Hospital.
In the center of Massena, NY 37B intersects North Main Street, which connects to NY 420 south of the village. The portion of Main Street between NY 420 and NY 37B is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY 970B, an unsigned reference route. Past North Main Street, NY 37B follows Maple Street southeast to Center Street. The route merges with Center Street and becomes a divided highway as it connects to Willow Street by way of an interchange and intersects an eastward extension of Center Street.
NY 37B turns south at the interchange, becoming Parker Avenue and crossing over the Grasse River to meet East Orvis Street on the southern riverbank. Here, the route turns east to follow East Orvis Street northeastward through the residential and commercial areas that comprise southeastern Massena. At the Massena village line, East Orvis Street becomes Highland Road, a name NY 37B retains for a short distance eastward to a junction with NY 37 (St. Regis Boulevard). Although Highland Road continues through the intersection, NY 37B ends at the junction.
History
In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 32, an unsigned legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena on what is now NY 420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route 32 continued west on modern NY 37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route 32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY 3, a highway extending across the width of the state.
The segment of NY 3 east of Watertown was rerouted as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to largely follow its modern alignment between Watertown and Plattsburgh. Most of NY 3's former alignment along the St. Lawrence River from Alexandria Bay to Hogansburg became part of the new NY 37; however, from Waddington to Massena, NY 37 used a more inland routing. As a result, the former routing of NY 3 between the two villages became NY 37B instead. In the mid-to-late 1950s, NY 37 was rerouted to follow a new bypass around the southern edge of Massena. Following its completion, NY 37B was extended eastward along NY 37's former routing on Maple Street, Parker Avenue, and Orvis Street to meet the bypass east of the village.
In the 1950s, construction began on the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks that would make the St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water in order to create a navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY 37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July 1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY 37B west of Massena.
Following the destruction of the majority of NY 37B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet of Louisville Corner, where it came to an end at NY 37. The remainder of NY 37B along the Massena–Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY 37 in Louisville and NY 37B and Massena utilizing NY 37's former routing west of the village was designated as NY 131. The alignments of NY 37B and NY 131 west of the Maple Street / Town Line Road intersection were flipped , placing NY 131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY 37B on NY 37's former routing into Massena.

Baron Eberhardt Otto George von Bock (died 21 January 1814) was a Hanoverian born major-general in the British army during the Napoleonic Wars.
Biography
Bock was descended from an old military family, and entered the Hanoverian cavalry about the year 1781. Their name appears as a premier-lieutenant in the 6th Hanoverian dragoons in 1789, and as rittmeister (captain) in 1800. They served in the Hanoverian Garde du Corps under Freytag in the Flanders Campaign and was slightly wounded by two sabre cuts on the arm and head at the Battle of Famars 23 May 1793.
On the dissolution of the Hanoverian army after the convention of Artlenburg, Bock was one of the officers who travelled to England, where they raised four troops of heavy cavalry, designated as the 1st dragoons, King's German Legion, and was gazetted colonel 21 April 1804. The regiment was formed at Weymouth, and was a particular favourite of George III. Bock served at its head in Lord Cathcart's expedition to Hanover in 1805; also in Ireland, whither it was sent after its return home. From Ireland Bock, who had attained the rank of major-general in 1810, proceeded to the Peninsular War in 1811 in command of a brigade composed of the two heavy cavalry regiments of the Legion, with which they made the subsequent campaigns in Spain and the south of France in 1812–13. The steadiness and gallantry of Bock's heavy Germans often won approval, particularly on 23 July 1812, the day after the victory at Salamanca, when in a charge at Garcia Hernandez, they attacked, broke and made prisoner three battalions of French infantry formed in square, usually thought of as a formation impregnable to cavalry.
Bock was made temporary commander of Wellington's Cavalry during Cotton's convalescence July–October 1812, and again December 1812-June 1813. They served in the rearguard during the retreat from Burgos 1812, mishandling an ambush at Venta del Pozo (Villadrigo) 23 October. In 1813 they served at Vitoria 21 June.
Bock suffered from being very short sighted - before the charge at Garcia Hernandez they had to ask to be pointed in the direction of the enemy.
On 21 January 1814, Bock was drowned together with their son Lewis and other officers when the transport ship Bellona was wrecked on the Tulbest rocks, en route to England. Their body was washed on shore at the little Breton village of Pleubian and interred.

Much of this Congress was taken up with Joseph Stalin's struggle against the Georgian Bolshevists. Stalin dominated the Congress with Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze and Mamia Orakhelashvili, moving against the Old Bolsheviks Budu Mdivani and Filipp Makharadze. Stalin accused the latter of the following:
"Violation of party discipline", namely contact Lenin directly not through party channels
"Disobeying decisions of the Central Committee of the RCP(b)"
"Demanding special economic concessions for Georgia"
"local chauvinism" and "imperialism" as they were accused of oppressing smaller nations such as the Ossetians and Abkhazians
"The desire to obtain privileged positions for Georgians"
Ordzhonikidze went further:
Collaboration with Mensheviks during 1918–1920
Retaining class enemies (landlords) in the Georgian Communist Party
Granting political amnesty to Mensheviks
As well as "leftism" and "adventurism"
Aftermath
Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev attended this Congress, but they were subject to attack immediately afterwards in the Tartar newspaper Eshche and arrested during May 1923. They were roundly condemned by Stalin at the Fourth Conference of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (b) with the Workers of the National Republics of the Regions, held 9–12 June 1923.
At this Congress, the RCP(b) redefined the problems of nationalism identifying local chauvinism as the main problem rather than Great Russian chauvinism. The Congress was the beginning of the so-called policy of Korenizatsiya. The main idea was to grow national cadres for every nationality so that the party line could be pursued everywhere by representatives of the local nationality and the national proletariat could be raised against its own exploiters.

Mont-Terri Castle is a ruined medieval castle above a prehistoric hillfort on Mont Terri, located in the municipality of Cornol of the Canton of Jura in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance.
Description
Mont Terri forms a buttress of the Lomont ridge (part of the Jura mountains), and is separated from it by a saddle called Derrière Mont Terri. The wooded summit forms a plateau four hectares (ten acres) in area. It is bounded on the west and southwest sides by steep cliffs, the remaining sides are protected by an ancient rampart. At the highest point of the plateau are the remains of a medieval fortified tower.
History
The summit of Mont Terri is known locally as "Julius Caesar's Camp" (French language: Camp de Jules César); however, the earliest traces of habitation are from the Neolithic era. Pottery finds suggests that there was occupation during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. During the 1st century BC, a rampart was built of typical Gallic construction, a Murus Gallicus; it has been associated with the Gallic Wars, but the only firm dating for the site is a later Roman coin from the reign of Augustus. There are also finds from a further period of occupation in the 4th century AD and other finds extend into the 10th century. A stone tower was built on the site in the 13th century, probably replacing a previous wooden one, and is probably the "Château Thierry" mentioned in contemporary texts.
Archaeological investigations
The first investigation of the site was by an antiquarian and Jesuit priest, Father Pierre-Joseph Dunod, at the start of the 18th century. Writing in 1716, Father Dunod speculated that the site was the scene of a decisive battle between Caesar and the Suebi tribe led by Ariovistus. There were later excavations by the owners of the site, Koeckler and Maupassant, who were found to have planted antiquities that they had purchased elsewhere, the deception being uncovered in 1862 by archaeologist Auguste Quiquerez (1801-1882). In the 20th century, methodical excavations by Alban Gerster (1898-1986) and in 1984 by a team from the University of Basle, have uncovered a range of finds from Neolithic flint arrow heads to a 10th-century dinarius coin from the reign of Louis IV of France.

The Bellingham Giants were a Minor League Baseball team in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, based in Bellingham, Washington, for two seasons (1995, 1996), and were an affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. After years of struggling attendance, co-owners Jerry Walker and William Tucker moved the franchise south to Keizer, Oregon, and began play in 1997 as the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes.
History
The franchise arrived in 1973 as the Bellingham Dodgers, affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers. When Major League Baseball returned to Seattle in , the expansion Mariners placed their first minor league affiliate in Bellingham. The club adopted the moniker of their parent club, taking the name Bellingham Mariners, but were commonly referred to as the "Baby M's."
Bellingham enjoyed a long affiliation with the Mariners, lasting eighteen years, through 1994. Following that season, the Mariners signed a player development contract with Everett, who had been a Giants affiliate since 1984, and Everett became the AquaSox. Seattle and San Francisco, essentially swapped affiliates as Bellingham inked an agreement with the Giants. Like their predecessors, who mirrored their parent clubs, the team took the name Giants.
Bellingham went in 1995 to earn the top spot in the north division, and the Giants faced the Boise Hawks for the league crown. Boise bested Bellingham in the deciding game of the best-of-three NWL championship series. Despite winning a division title, the Giants struggled at the gate, and were last in the league in attendance.
The Giants returned in 1996 and were , a half-game behind the division winning Yakima Bears. Attendance woes continued as the Giants failed to eclipse fifty thousand in attendance. Following the season, the franchise relocated to Keizer, Oregon, opened a new $7 million ballpark in 1997, and rebranded as the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes.
Ballpark
The Bellingham franchise played at Joe Martin Field, a venue with a seating capacity near 1,600. The park is currently the home of the Bellingham Bells of the West Coast League.

Hettiarachchige Reginald Jothipala (; 12 February 1936 – 7 July 1987), popularly as H. R. Jothipala, was a Sri Lankan playback singer in the Sinhala cinema as well as a film actor. Considered as the best playback singer in Sri Lankan film history, Jothipala lent their voice to all classes of actors ranging from Eddie Jayamanne to Ranjan Ramanayake. They also worked as an opera singer. They died in July 1987 at the age of 51 year from cardiac arrest.
Personal life
Jothipala was born on 12 February 1936 in Dematagoda, Colombo, Sri Lanka as the first child in a middle-class family. Their father H. R. James was a tailor in Matara and mother Ahaliyagoda H. K. Podinona Perera was a nurse. Their home town is Matara, Sri Lanka & They later moved to Colombo. They attended St. Lawrence College in Maradana and St. John's College in Dematagoda. They have four younger sisters and one younger brother.
Jothipala would visit tea kiosks to hear music as their family didn't own a radio. They cleaned medicine bottles at the Sulaiman Hospital on Armor Street, Colombo. Later they worked as the peon in M. D. Gunasena and the company.
They were married to Blossom Winter, they had four daughters together. They came to be known by their initials "H. R." and was loved as "Hadhavatha Raththaran Jothipala", meaning "golden-hearted Jothipala", due to their kindness to people of all ages, communities, and families.
Career
Early days
Nadarajah, one of the best radio tabla players in the country at the time, was living at Kosgas Junction in Grandpass, Colombo. One day they heard Jothipala singing and chose to sing Hindi songs at the weddings of the Colombo aristocracy. B. S. Perera, the famous film music director who was the head of the radio orchestra who first recognized Jothipala's talents. In 1952, there was a program on the radio called 'Adhunika Peya', which showcased the talents of amateur singers, courtesy of the Queen Sweets Company. They competed in this competition and became the winner. From there they went to the radio program "Jayagrahi Pelapaliya" and won first place.
In 1955, they missed three golden opportunities to become a playback singer. At first, they went to meet Wimalaweera master who composed music for the film Podi Putha. During the audition, Wimalaweera informed Jothipala that their voice is not right, where it trembles and not sweet. In February, Jothipala and Chandrasena went Negombo and met B. A. W. Jayamanne and Rukmani Devi. Even though they satisfied about their voice, Jothipala could not go to India for playback as they did not have a passport. In the third time, they met A. B. Raj, director of the film Perakadoru Bena. They refused Jothipala due to having rough voice.
Jothipala made their debut as a playback singer on Cyril P. Abeyratne's Surathalee, singing "Siriyame Sara", in 1956. Jothipala has said that they contemplated taking their life when they went with their friends to watch Podi Putha and found out that their song was not included. Later when Surathalee producer Jabir A. Cader wanted to hear one of their songs to consider them for the film, Jothipala almost passed on the offer as they did not possess enough money to create a record. They were helped out by veteran musician Stanley Omar who financed them for the sum of 35 rupees – a large amount of money at the time. Jothipala's song on the film, "Siriyame Sara," still remains popular in Sri Lanka, having recorded the popular number under the direction of T.R. Papa at Wahini Studio in India.
Jothipala has worked with many reputed directors of Sri Lanka. In the early stages of their prolific career, Jothipala got the chance to work with the prolific filmmaker, Lester James Peries on the movie Sandeshaya. Jothipala sang the song "Puruthugeesi Karaya" for the film, which was composed by the legendary Sunil Santha and written by veteran lyricist Arisen Ahubudu.
Success
Jothipala was the undisputed choice in films that were made in the late sixties and through the seventies, the period during which they also began to act. Though Jothi was criticized for singing to the tunes of popular Hindi songs, particularly of Mohammed Rafi, they also sang under the batons of P.V. Nandasiri, Premasiri Khemadasa, Sarath Dassanayake and Milton Mallawarachchi. Jothipala is considered the backbone of Sri Lankan playback singing. They have voiced a wide array of actors across many decades in their era. Apart from singing, they also acted in 33 films.
They sang in hundreds of films including popular hits like Kasthuri Suwanda, Thushara, Sweeep Ticket, Hitha Honda Minihek, Kawuda Raja, Hondata Hondai, Wasana, Sangeetha and others. The award-winning singer also played some memorable roles in films including Ethulweema Thahanam, Sulalitha Sobani, Sujeewa, Sukiri Kella, Abirahasa, Bonikka, Shanthi and their own production Sumithuro and Obai Mamai. They made their film debut as an actor in 1963 with a lame character in the film Sudu Sande Kalu Wala and later played mostly villain characters.
Although Jothipala was very talented in their own respect, they were criticized for singing to the tunes of popular Hindi songs, particularly of Mohammed Rafi. Jothipala sang many duets with Sujatha Attanayake and Latha Walpola,'but largely with Angeline Gunathilake. Jothipala's best friend was the then popular singer J. A. Milton Perera. In the late 1950s, the duo debated their theme song "Anangaya" cult on the radio commercial service. Jothipala won the Best Singer award for their song "Mee Jeevanaye" from the 1974 film Onna Babo Billo Enawa. At the 1983 Sarasaviya Awards, Jothipala won the Award for Best Singer for the song "Sara Sande" from the film Meedum Sihina and for the song "Paalu Susane" from the 1986 film Obata Divana Kiyannam.
Death
Two days before their death, on 5 July 1987, they participated in "Gam Udaawa", a patriotic project by late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, and sang on their final open stage. But while singing they felt pain but finished the singing successfully. The next day they were admitted to the hospital. Jothipala died on 7 July 1987 at Ratnams Private Hospital. The cause of their death was said to be liver failure. "He came to our hospital very regularly. Ramya Fleming was in charge of the ICU and was at home when they got the call to come in. As soon as news spread of Jothipala's death, people surrounded Ratnams Private Hospital. All of Union Square was filled with fans, and some even jumped over the hospital gate just to get a glimpse of Jothipala.
Numerous activities are still underway throughout the country for their commemorations.

Hauksbók (; 'Book of Haukr'), Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar AM 371 4to, AM 544 4to and AM 675 4to, is an Icelandic manuscript, now in three parts but originally one, dating from the 14th century. It was created by the Icelander Haukr Erlendsson. It is now fragmentary, with significant portions being lost, but is the first surviving witness to many of the texts it contains (although in most cases Haukr is known to have been copying from earlier, lost manuscripts). Among these are the section on mathematics called Algorismus
and the text of Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks.
Composition
Hauksbók is associated with an Icelandic lawspeaker named Haukr Erlendsson: although the work of several scribes, the vast majority is in Haukr's hand. Palaeographical evidence allowed Professor Stefán Karlsson, director of the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, to date the manuscript to between 1302 and 1310. As long back as it is possible to trace the manuscript it has been called Hauksbók after him. Hauksbók is a compilation that includes Icelandic sagas and a redaction of Landnámabók. The book contains versions, often the only or earliest extant versions, of many Old Icelandic texts, such as Fóstbrœðra saga, Eiríks saga rauða, Hervarar saga and Völuspá. Haukr tended to rewrite the sagas that they copied, generally shortening them.
In addition, Haukr Erlendsson wrote "Hauk's Annals," which chronicled events of their lifetime and a handbook on Norse law.

In 1908, Hay was elected as Lieutenant Governor of Washington, and they became Governor upon the death of Samuel G. Cosgrove, after only about two months in office in March 1909. They served the remainder of Cosgrove's unexpired term and left office in 1913. Focusing on corruption in state government, they called a special session of the legislature to investigate and impeach dishonest state officials. During their administration, the Workman's Compensation law and women's suffrage were enacted.
Defeated for re-election in 1912, they returned to manage their personal business interests and property holdings, and was chairperson of the 12th District Regional Agricultural Credit Corporation.
Death
Hay died of a heart attack at their office on November 21, 1933 and is interred at the mausoleum at Riverside Memorial Park, Spokane.

The tooth-billed wren (Odontorchilus cinereus) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae. It is found in Bolivia and Brazil.
Taxonomy and systematics
The tooth-billed wren shares its genus with one other species, the grey-mantled wren (Odontorchilus branickii). Some authors have suggested that they are conspecific or that they form a superspecies. The tooth-billed wren is monotypic.
Description
The tooth-billed wren is long; one male weighed . Adults have a grayish cinnamon crown, a grayish brown face, and a medium gray back. their throat and breast are buffy gray, the belly pale buff, and the flanks grayish white. The juvenile looks essentially the same.
Distribution and habitat
The tooth-billed wren is found mostly in Brazil but its range extends slightly into Bolivia's Santa Cruz Department. It is found south of the Amazon River between the Madeira River on the west and the Xingú River on the east. It inhabits tall humid lowland forest at elevations up to .
Behavior
Feeding
The tooth-billed wren's diet is not known in detail, but the species is insectivorous. It forages in the canopy, above ground, exploring and probing the foliage along branches and in vine tangles. It usually is part of a mixed-species foraging flock.
Breeding
The tooth-billed wren's breeding season appears to span from June to September based on dates when active nests, dependent juveniles, and physiological evidence have been observed. It nests in a cavity in a limb or trunk high above the ground. The clutch size is believed to be two.
Vocalization
The tooth-billed wren's typical song is "a short, simple trill" ; both sexes sing it.
Status
The IUCN has assessed the tooth-billed wren to be of The Least Concern. The species' population has not been quantified and is "suspected to decline by a rate approaching 30% over three generations.'

Daniel Fitter (born in Worcestershire, England, 1628; died at St. Thomas' Priory, near Stafford, 6 Feb., 1700) was an English Catholic clergyman who was affected by but managed to navigate their way through the religious strife of the late seventeenth century.
They entered the English College, Lisbon at the age of nineteen, went through their studies with some distinction, and was raised to the priesthood in 1651. A year or two later, they returned to England, and was appointed chaplain to William Fowler, Esq., of St. Thomas' Priory, where they remained until their death. During the reign of James II of England, they opened a school at Stafford, which was suppressed during the Glorious Revolution. At the period of controversy following the Titus Oates plot (1678), he, with a few others, upheld the lawfulness of taking the oath then tendered to every well-known Catholic. They themselves took the oath, and defended their action on the ground of a common and legal use of the term "spiritual". In consequence of this, when the chapter chose them as Vicar-General of the Counties of Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Salop, they required that they should "sign a Declaration made by our Brethren in Paris against the Oath of Supremacy".
In a letter to the clergy of England and Scotland (1684), Cardinal Philip Howard recommended warmly the "Institutum clericorum in communi viventium", founded in 1641 by the German priest Bartholomew Holzhauser, and approved by Innocent XI in 1680 and 1684. The institute met with eager acceptance in England, and Fitter was appointed its first provincial president and procurator for the Midland district. The association was, however, dissolved shortly after their death by Bishop Giffard in 1702, on account of a misunderstanding between its members and the rest of the secular clergy. Fitter had bequeathed property to "The Common Purse" of the institute, with a life-interest in favour of their elder brother Francis; but when the institute ceased to exist, Francis, by a deed of assignment, established a new trust (1703), called "The Common Fund" for the benefit of the clergy of the district. This fund became subsequently known as "The Johnson Fund" and still exists. Daniel Fitter also left a fund for the maintenance of a priest, whose duty it should be to reside in the county of Stafford and take spiritual charge of the poor Catholics of the locality.

Mansukhlal Maganlal Jhaveri (1907–1981) was a Gujarati language poet, critic, and literary historian of the Gandhian era. They were deeply interested in classical Sanskrit poetry and authored History of Gujarati Literature (1978). Jhaveri had several pen-names including Devaki Ayodhya, Punarvasu, Madilant, Samintiyajak, and Siddhartha.
Biography
Mansukhlal Jhaveri was born on 3 October 1907 in Jamnagar, Gujarat. They completed their primary and secondary education in Jamnagar and matriculated in 1931. They acquired a Bachelor of Arts in 1935 and a Master of Arts in 1937 from Samaldas College, Bhavnagar. They subsequently taught at Raiya College in Mumbai, Dharmendrasinhji College in Rajkot from 1940 to 1945, and St. Xavier's College in Mumbai from 1945 to 1958. From 1958 to 1963, they served as principal of Madhwani Arts and Commerce College, Porbandar. In 1966, they returned to Mumbai to teach but soon after became a principal at BEC College, Kolkata. They died on 27 August 1981 in Mumbai.
Jhaveri married Hasmukhgauri and had four daughters and a son. The Maryland-based psychotherapist and author Anita Gadhia-Smith is their granddaughter.
Works
Their first poetry collection, Chandradut (1929), is an adaptation of Meghadūta by Kālidāsa, written in Mandakranta meter. Their other poetry collections are Phooldol (1933), Aaradhana (1939), Abhisar (1947), Anubhuti (1956) and Doomo Ogalyo (1975), which contain rhythmic poems about love, nature and God. Deeply influenced by classical Sanskrit poetry, Jhaveri also wrote poems on mythological themes such as Abhimanyu and Ashwatthama.
According to the Encyclopedia of Indian Literature, Jhaveri was a critic of the first order in the poet-critic tradition of Gujarati literature. They deeply studied Eastern and Western concepts of literary criticism and published several books of critical articles and reviews including Thoda Vivechan Lekho (1944), Paryeshana (1952), Kavyavimarsha (1962), Abhigam (1966), Govardhanram (1967), Nhanalal (1967), Kanaiylal Munshi (1970), Umashankar Joshi (1971), Gujarati Sahityabhasha (1972), Balwantrai Thakor (1976), Aapno Kavita Vaibhav Vol. 1 and 2 (1974, 1975), Drishtikon (1978), Gandhiyug Nu Sahitya (1978) and Umashankar Joshi – Natyakar (1979). In Aapno Kavita Vaibhav, they presented an anthology of Gujarati poetry from 1850 to 1973.
Jhaveri wrote History of Gujarati Literature (1978), in English. In collaboration with other writers, they wrote a history of Gujarati literature in Gujarati: Gujarati Sahityanu Rekhadarshan (1953).
Some of their works, including Gujarati Bhasha: Vyakaran ane Lekhan (1946), Bhasha Parichay Part 1 to 4 (1951 to 1957) and Vakapriththakaran ane Suddhalekhan (1965), are based on Gujarati grammar and language. Dashamskandha (1942), Mari Shrestha Vartao (1952), Navi Kavita (1952; with others), Gujarati Tunki Varta (1960), Dayaram (1960) and Aapna Urmikavyo (1976) are the compilations they edited.
Jhaveri translated Kalidasa's Abhijnanshakuntalam into Gujarati as Smritibramsha athva Shapit Shakuntala (1928). They also translated Shakespeare's Hamlet and Othello into Gujarati.

Donald Nelson Frey (pronounced Frī ) (March 23, 1923 – March 5, 2010), was widely known as the Ford Motor Company product manager who, along with Lee Iacocca and others, developed the Ford Mustang into a viable project — and who ultimately supervised the development of the car in a record 18 months.
At times besieged by autograph seekers for their role with the Mustang, Frey, a third generation engineer, was "one of the few auto executives with experience in all three of the industry's essential areas: design, manufacture and sales." They had nonetheless been most proud of assisting Ford in introducing safety improvements to their lineup, including disc brakes and radial tires. In 1967, Time called Frey "Detroit's sharpest idea man".
Frey went on to a successful career as an innovator in manufacturing and information systems and as chairperson and CEO Bell & Howell. In 1990, they received the National Medal of Technology in a White House ceremony.
They were elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.
Background
Frey was born to Edward Muir Luken and Margaret Bryden (née Nelson) Frey in St. Louis, Missouri. Their paternal great-grandfather, Abraham Frey, was born in Leipzig, Germany.
They grew up with their younger brother Stuart M. (who later became chief engineer at Ford Motor Company after Donald) in Waterloo, Iowa, where their father worked for Deere & Company. Their father, a metallurgist, designed the 1923 John Deere Model D tractor, and would later work for the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. As children, Frey and their brother had once made gunpowder — from scratch.
Frey received their diploma from Bethel High School. In 1940, they began engineering school at Michigan State College.
During World War II Frey worked on the Packard V-1650 version of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine for Packard Motors, the engines to be sent to England for placement in the Hurricanes and Spitfires. They then served as an officer in the United States Army (1942–1946).
After the war they returned to their studies, this time at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. At Michigan's College of Engineering, they earned a Bachelor of Science degree in metallurgy (1947), a master's degree in systems engineering (1949), and a Ph.D. in metallurgical engineering (1951). During their doctoral studies they were an assistant professor.
Frey married four times, to Margaret (mother of their six children), Mary Cameron, Arvelene Gore, and last wife Kay Eberley, from whom they were separated. They died March 5, 2010 in Evanston, Illinois, at age 86, survived by three daughters, Margaret Walton, Catherine McNair, and Elizabeth Sullivan and two sons, Christopher and Donald Jr.
Frey was trilingual (speaking English, Russian and French), was an avid follower of opera and archaeology, and while at Ford, read "the London Times Literary Supplement as avidly as Ward's Automotive Reports." At the time of their death, Frey owned (and drove) a two-tone merlot and white 19641/2 Mustang.
Ford and the Mustang
Frey started working for Ford in 1950, managing Ford's metallurgy department. They later are named vice-president and chief engineer (1964). In addition to the many industrial innovations Frey oversaw at Ford, they supervised the prototype styling of the Ford Mustang and its later development.
Frey pursued the Mustang after Henry Ford II had rejected it four times, in no small part because of the Edsel's spectacular failure. Without formal approval, Frey met clandestinely with Lee Iacocca and other engineers and designers- notably lead stylists Philip T. Clark and John Najjar to continue developing the car.
Speaking to USA Today in 2004, Frey said "The whole project was bootlegged, there was no official approval of this thing. We had to do it on a shoestring." Consequently, when Henry Ford II did approve the project, they put Frey in charge and told them they would be fired if the Mustang was not successful. Ultimately, the Mustang was a huge success, despite being engineered at one tenth the cost of the 1965 Ford Galaxie.
Mike Mueller quoted Frey in their 2009 book Mustang: An American Classic as attributing the inspiration for the Mustang to GM's strategy of incrementally improving the Corvair. "I guess in desperation they put bucket seats in the thing, called it the Monza, and it started to sell".
Frey was also behind the four-door Ford Thunderbird (fifth generation), the stereo dashboard tape deck, and the station wagon tailgate that swung out like a door (window up or down) as well as down like a tailgate — marketed as the "Magic Doorgate" beginning with the 1966 Country Squire and Country Sedan. They were later involved in the development of the Ford Bronco, and played a key role in Ford Motorsports.
In 1967, they received an honorary Doctorate in Engineering from the University of Michigan. They were very concerned that the United States was losing the "global race" for automobile improvements in technology because there is little interest in investments for innovation and thus an increasing "gap" between the U.S. with Japan and Germany.
Also in 1967, Frey was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for the development of gas turbine engines.
Frey is one of the main characters in the movie Ford v Ferrari, in their role involving development of the Ford GT40.
Later career
Frey left Ford in 1968, in part because of differences with fellow Ford executive Lee Iacocca, resigning to become president of General Cable Corporation. Environmental issues became Frey's focus, leading them to establish new copper recycling methods.
In 1971, they were appointed chairperson and CEO of Bell & Howell, replacing Peter G. Peterson who left to join the Nixon Administration, making "a sweeping transformation of a company still known for film, microfiche and microfilm, as the video era dawned." Frey made several strategic acquisitions at Bell & Howell, sold off businesses (e.g., the DeVry Institute of Technology, now DeVry University), and they pioneered moves into video cassettes for movies and CD-ROM information systems in the 1970s and 1980s.
They were instrumental in promoting the first successful CD-ROM-based information system, designing the dealer auto parts catalog for General Motors, by David Gump, to be distributed to dealers on CD. Next they put GM's maintenance records on CD-ROM, and then maintenance records for Mercedes-Benz, producing a computer file for every Mercedes ever made.
They also became a member of the board of directors at 20th Century Fox during this time. They helped bring about the first high-volume integrated manufacture of video cassettes for the motion picture industry. Tapes had previously been made in real time, with hundreds of high school students changing out tapes, but when Bob Pfannkuch heard that DuPont started making tapes out of chromium dioxide instead of iron dioxide, Bell & Howell developed technology that could make a copy of a film in about a minute, cutting production time by over 99 percent.
Frey retired from active executive industry management in 1988. Just as they were to retire Bell & Howell was bought out by the Robert M. Bass Group, headed by the wealthy Texas millionaire Robert Bass, proving serendipitous to Frey and the shareholders. With the buyout the shares in Bell & Howell stock went from $5 to $64 per share during their tenure.
After Bell & Howell they became a professor and researcher at Northwestern University, in the Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences (IE/MS) Department.
Frey served, until their death, on the board of directors for Stonewater Control Systems,
Frey Prize
As a tribute to their parents (his father was an engineer and their mother was studying engineering when the couple married) they set up the Margaret and Muir Frey Memorial Prize for Innovation and Creativity ("Frey Prize") at the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University in 2001. The undergraduate prize "recognizes design creativity in the best senior capstone projects — projects that integrate aspects of the McCormick curriculum and are designed by a student or team of students to address known problems or credible new products or processes".

Marie Samuel Njie was a musician and singer, from, and popular in, The Gambia.
Life and family
Marie Samuel Njie was an important griot singer and cultural icon in their home country, The Gambia. They came from a family that produced several major griot singers.
Them songs were accompanied by a xalam, calabash, and sabar, and were mainly about social and political issues as well as everyday life.
They regularly entertained the high society of Bathurst (now Banjul). They were also active in the 1950s in the Gambia Democratic Party, and later performed at party meetings of the United Party of Pierre Sarr N'Jie.
Them son Pap Touray or Paps Touray (c. 1944 – 19 May 2007) was also a successful musician from the 1960s and a former mentor of the Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour. They were a co-founder and lead singer of the Super Eagles and Ifang Bondi ( de ) bands, as well as a composer and songwriter. Them other son, Abdoulie Mbye, commonly known as Abdoulie "Efri" Mbye or Efri Mbye, nicknamed Everybody Mbye, ? — 11 June 2019) was a historian, narrator and singer. Marie Samuel Njie had a major influence in both their children's singing careers. They were married to Goreh Mbye. Through their father Modou Njie, they were second cousin to the renowned Gambian historian and Pan-Africanist Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof via their paternal grandmother Lingeer Ndombuur Joof (Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof's great aunt), and a member of the Joof royal family of Sine, Saloum and Baol, as well as a member of the Njie royal family of Jolof. Them mother Rohey Njie was the daughter of Chaby Nyang, sister of the 19th century Gambian elder and renowned exorcist and seer Biram Camonge Nyang, themselves a relative of Cham Joof. Although known as a griot, ancestrally, just like Youssou N'Dour, they were of royal blood. Some of the legendary traditional female singers of their generation included the late Sosseh Jange; Yaham Nyang (commonly known as Ya Mundow Nyang or Yamoundow Nyang); and Ya Mundow Jobe (or Yamoundow Jobe), wife of renowned Gambian oral historian and xalam player Doudou Nying (commonly known as Dodou Nying Kol Yandeh or Dodou Nying Koliyandeh)—a regular on Radio Gambia and Radio Senegal's joint weekly history programme Chossani Senegambia from the 1970s.

From 1867 to 1918, Országgyűlés (; "National Assembly") was the name of the bicameral parliament of the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania) during the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918), replacing the earlier Hungarian Diet.
The legislative power was vested in this parliament, consisting of two houses: an upper house titled the Főrendiház (, House of Magnates), and a lower house titled the Képviselőház (, House of Representatives). From 1902 the Országgyűlés met at the Hungarian Parliament Building on the Danube in Budapest.
Early history
An assembly of the Hungarian estates of the realm and royal free cities (szabad királyi város) had convened at Bratislava (Pozsony) since the late Middle Ages; however, it never achieved extended legislative rights in the centralised Habsburg monarchy and the succeeding Austrian Empire. In the course of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 a national assembly was called at Pest that was dismissed by decree of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria in October; the next year a Hungarian assembly met at the Protestant Great Church of Debrecen, which declared the new Emperor Franz Joseph deposed and elected Lajos Kossuth regent-president. The revolution was finally suppressed by Austrian troops under General Julius Jacob von Haynau and the assembly dissolved.
The Habsburgs again approached toward the Hungarian estates after the disastrous defeat at the 1859 Battle of Solferino and the loss of Lombardy. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph issued the October Diploma, which provided a national Reichsrat assembly formed by delegates deputed by the Landtage diets of the Austrian crown lands, followed by the February Patent of 1861, promising the implementation of a bicameral legislature. The Hungarian magnates however rejected to be governed from Vienna and insisted on an own parliamentary assembly with comprehensive autonomy in Hungarian affairs. The negotiations failed, predominantly due to the tough stance of Austrian Minister-President Anton von Schmerling.
Finally in the course of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the emperor appointed Gyula Andrássy Hungarian minister-president and the re-established national assembly convened on 27 February.
Főrendiház (House of Magnates)
The House of Magnates was, like the current British House of Lords, composed of hereditaries, ecclesiastics, and, unlike the House of Lords, deputized representatives from autonomous regions (Similar to Resident Commissioners of United States territories). The House had no fixed membership size, as anyone who met the qualifications could sit in it. The official list:
Princes of the royal house who have attained their majority (16 in 1904)
Hereditary peers who paid at least 3000 florins a year land tax (237 in 1904) (at its 1896 exchange rate, £1 was worth 12 florins, so this comes to £250)
High dignitaries of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches (42 in 1904)
Representatives of the Protestant confessions (13 in 1904)
Life peers appointed by the Crown, not exceeding 50 in number, and life peers elected by the house itself (73 altogether in 1904)
Various state dignitaries and high judges (19 in 1904)
Three delegates of Croatia-Slavonia
Képviselőház (House of Representatives)
The House of Representatives consisted of members elected, under the Electoral Law of 1874, by a complicated franchise based upon property, taxation, profession or official position, and ancestral privileges. The House consisted of 453 members, of which 413 are deputies elected in Hungary and 43 delegates of Croatia-Slavonia sent by the parliament of that Kingdom. Their terms were for five years and were remunerated.
The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition considered the franchise "probably the most illiberal in Europe". The working classes were wholly unrepresented in the parliament, only 6% of them, and 13% of the small trading class, possessing the franchise, which was only enjoyed by 6% of the entire population.
The parliament was summoned annually by the king at Budapest. While official language was Hungarian, but the delegates of Croatia-Slavonia were allowed to use Croatian language in the proceedings. The Hungarian parliament had power to legislate on all matters concerning Hungary, but for Croatia-Slavonia only on matters which concern these provinces in common with Hungary. The executive power was vested in a cabinet responsible to it, consisting of ten ministers, including: the president of the council, the minister for Croatia-Slavonia, a minister ad latum, and the ministers of the interior, of national defence, of education and public worship, of finance, of agriculture, of industry and commerce, and of justice.

Shark fin dumpling () is a dim sum dish in Hong Kong. It is a form of Dumpling in Superior Soup (), a dumpling with gelatinous broth inside. As with shark fin soup, the shark fin content is often replaced with an imitation.
History
Dumpling in Superior Soup () originated from Ming dynasty in Yangzhou. In that time, pigskin was a preferred ingredient of brewis. As pigskin is composed of collagen which is a main component of connective tissue, brewis would be solidified after it was dissolved, forming a gel-like structure. It would then be integrated into bread for consumption. According to the Qing dynasty cookbook Suiyuan shidan this is the ancestral form of dumpling in superior soup.
The use of shark fin as an ingredient of dumplings appeared in the 1980s, when the economy of Hong Kong was growing rapidly. Part of the Chinese restaurants would like to produce something luxury so as to emphasize the class difference or attract consumers. As time went on, actual shark fin was sometimes replaced by thin bean noodle.
Ingredients and preparation
The standard ingredients include shark fin, meirou, shrimp, crab sticks, shiitake and straw mushrooms. The dish is prepared with red agar for texture, and seasoned with salt, MSG, sugar, meal-cake, and ground white pepper.
With mass production commonly seen today, there can be a great variance from the traditional cooking method, quality, and ingredient composition. Reduction in filling quantity, cheaper raw materials, and substitution of ingredients is not uncommon. Chicken shreds can be replaced by ham shreds, prawn replaced by dried shrimp, mushroom varieties swapped, and the amount of shark's fin reduced.
Evolution
Over time, Hong Kong chefs have updated the classic recipe to appeal to customers. Some of these developments include:
Green Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling (翡翠魚翅灌湯餃) in which the fin is mixed with vegetable juice during cooking for colour and flavour.
Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling with Bamboo Pith (竹笙魚翅灌湯餃)
Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling with crab-meat (蟹肉魚翅灌湯餃)
Vegetarian Shark's Fin & Prawn Dumpling (素翅灌湯餃) - Nowadays, Hong Kongers are more environmental friendly. Therefore, some of the restaurants use 'fake shark's fin' to replace the shark's fin to avoid killing sharks in order to protect this species. The 'fake shark's fin' is mainly made of Gelatin or Konjac, some of them may be made of the bean vermicelli. Since it does not include any animal's ingredients, it is also suitable for vegetarian. Other than that, it is cheaper than shark's fin; the production cost can be lowed. Therefore, this shark's fin & prawn dumpling is one of example of adaptability.
Restaurants
In the past, shark's fin and prawn dumpling has traditionally been a luxury dim sum, with only a select number of dim sum establishments offering the dish. These restaurants used expensive materials to make the filling like plenty of sharks's fin, chicken shreds, Shiitake mushrooms, prawn, pork, etc. The cooking method, time-consuming in nature, requires the soup to be filled into the dumpling then steamed in a bamboo steamer. As there is only one formal cooking method, fewer chiefs know how to make the dish in accordance with the traditional approach.
Today, societal changes have affected the nature and availability of the dish. A growing number of people are wealthy enough to afford luxury cuisine, and growing competition in the catering industry has led to a proliferation in the types of dim sum available in Hong Kong. There are currently several variations of shark's fin & prawn dumpling, such as vegetarian options, to meet differences in customer preferences. Availability and popularity has also increased. Some stores sell take-out dim sum, and supermarkets commonly stock frozen versions of shark's fin and prawn dumpling.

Ömer Diler (1945, Istanbul – 18 March 2005, Istanbul) was a Turkish numismatist specializing in Islamic coins. Their posthumous book Ilkhans is the definitive work on the coinage of the Ilkhanate.
Ömer Diler was trained as a chemical engineer but became interested in numismatics in 1972 when they received a rare gold coin of the Ottoman Empire as a gift. They wrote a number of articles for the Turkish Numismatic Society (Türk Numismatik Derneği) and was also a contributing editor of the American Numismatic Society.
In 1981, Diler published a book with Garo Kürkman on the coinage of the Anatolian beylik of 'Alâiye. Their 2001 work Şehir Lakapları (Titles and Epithets of Islamic Towns) represents a major contribution to the knowledge of the orthography and locations of Islamic mint towns. This work has become the standard reference on the subject.
In 1993 at the suggestion of Cüneyt Ölçer, Diler began work on what would become a comprehensive book on the coinage of the Ilkhanate. With more than 250 confirmed mints and a geographical distribution including Iran and large parts of Anatolia, the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Central Asia, the project consumed the last twelve years of Diler's life. When they died of lung cancer in 2005, the book remained unfinished. Final editing fell to their wife, Emine Nur, Garö Kürkman, and the Bremen-based numismatist, Johann-Christoph Hinrichs. Ilkhans: coinage of the Persian Mongols appeared in both Turkish and English versions in 2006. It includes 838 drawing and twelve plates of high quality photographs.

The Second Battle of Deep Bottom, also known as Fussell's Mill (particularly in the South), New Market Road, Bailey's Creek, Charles City Road, or White's Tavern was fought August 14–20, 1864, at Deep Bottom in Henrico County, Virginia, during the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign (Siege of Petersburg) of the American Civil War.
During the night of August 13–14, a force under the command of Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock crossed the James River at Deep Bottom to threaten Richmond and attract Confederate forces away from the Petersburg, Virginia, trenches and the Shenandoah Valley. On August 14, the X Corps closed on New Market Heights while the II Corps extended the Federal line to the right along Bailey's Creek. During the night, the X Corps was moved to the right flank of the Union line near Fussell's Mill. On August 16, Union assaults near the mill were initially successful, but Confederate counterattacks drove the Federals back. After days of indecisive skirmishing, the Federals returned to the south side of the James on the night of August 20. The Confederates achieved their objective of driving back the Union threat, but at a cost of diluting their forces as the Union had hoped.
Background
Deep Bottom is the colloquial name for an area of the James River in Henrico County southeast of Richmond, Virginia, at a horseshoe-shaped bend in the river known as Jones Neck. It was so-named because of the depth of the river bottom at that point. It was a convenient crossing point from the Bermuda Hundred area on the south side of the river.
Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant began a siege of the city of Petersburg, Virginia, after initial assaults on the Confederate lines, June 15–18, 1864, failed to break through. While Union cavalry conducted the Wilson-Kautz Raid (June 22 – July 1) in an attempt to cut the railroad lines leading into Petersburg, Grant and their generals planned a renewed assault on the Petersburg fortifications.
In the First Battle of Deep Bottom, July 27–29, Grant sent a force under Maj. Gens. Winfield S. Hancock and Philip H. Sheridan on an expedition threatening Richmond and its railroads, intending to attract Confederate troops away from the Petersburg defensive line. The Union infantry and cavalry force was unable to break through the Confederate fortifications at Bailey's Creek and Fussell's Mill and was withdrawn, but it achieved its desired effect of momentarily reducing Confederate strength at Petersburg. The planned attack on the fortifications went ahead on July 30, but the resulting Battle of the Crater was an embarrassing Union defeat, a fiasco of mismanaged resources by Grant's subordinates at a heavy cost in casualties.
On the same day the Union failed at the Crater, Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early was burning the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, as they operated out of the Shenandoah Valley, threatening towns in Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia. Gen. Robert E. Lee was concerned about actions that Grant might take against Early, and in fact Grant in the first week of August designated Phil Sheridan to command a consolidated Army of the Shenandoah to challenge Early with almost 40,000 men. Lee sent the infantry division of Maj. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw from Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's corps and the cavalry division commanded by Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee to Culpeper, Virginia, where they could either provide aid to Early or be recalled to the Richmond-Petersburg front as needed. Grant misinterpreted this movement and assumed that Anderson's entire corps had been removed from the vicinity of Richmond, leaving only about 8,500 men north of the James River. They determined to try again with an advance toward the Confederate capital. This would either prevent reinforcements from aiding Early or once again dilute the Confederate strength in the defensive lines around Petersburg.
Once again, Hancock would be the senior general on the expedition. On August 13, the X Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. David B. Birney, Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's cavalry division, and Hancock's II Corps artillery crossed pontoon bridges from Bermuda Hundred to Deep Bottom. Meanwhile, the remainder of the II Corps conducted a ruse to make the Confederates think that Hancock was being sent north to reinforce Sheridan. After a grueling march through oppressive heat to City Point—a march during which a number of the men were felled by heat stroke—they embarked on ships and steamed toward the Chesapeake Bay, many of the individual soldiers unaware of their actual destination. A tugboat followed the flotilla and brought new orders, which caused the transport ships to turn around and deposit the II Corps at Deep Bottom the night of August 13–14. The landings were not managed well and fell behind schedule; Grant's staff had not arranged for adequate wharves to handle the deep-water steamers.

August 14
After all of their troops were across the James on August 14, Hancock positioned Birney's X Corps on the left, Hancock's 3rd Division of II Corps, under Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott, in the center, and Hancock's 1st and 2nd Divisions, under Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow (temporarily commanding in the absence of Maj. Gen. John Gibbon), on the right. Birney was ordered to demonstrate against New Market Heights while the II Corps divisions attempted to turn the Confederate left. Mott was to push forward on the New Market Road toward Richmond, Barlow to attack Fussell's Mill on the Darbytown Road, and Gregg's cavalry to cover the right flank of the army and look for an opportunity to race into Richmond. Birney's troops successfully pushed aside pickets on the Kingsland Road, but were stopped by the fortifications on New Market Heights. The II Corps units moved slowly into position, suffering numerous deaths from heat stroke.
It was not until midday on August 14 that Barlow's men made contact with the Confederates, manning rifle pits on the Darbytown Road just north of the Long Bridge Road. The Union generals were surprised at the Confederate strength. In Birney's and Mott's fronts, a full Confederate division commanded by Maj. Gen. Charles W. Field was dug in. Chaffin's Bluff was defended by a division under Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox and reinforcements were arriving. Because of Barlow's slow approach in the heat, the Confederates had time to reinforce the Fussell's Mill area with a section of howitzers and Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson's Georgia brigade. Hancock had intended for Barlow's to be their primary attack and instructed them to employ sufficient mass along the Darbytown Road. Instead Barlow formed a wide line that reached as far as Mott's right flank. Because of this extension and the thick woods through which they had to advance, Barlow's 10,000 men in the two divisions were left with only a single brigade attacking Fussell's Mill. Those men were able to drive away two Confederate cavalry regiments from Brig. Gen. Martin W. Gary's brigade at the mill, but Anderson's brigade repulsed it. When Field took Anderson's brigade from their right flank, it weakened the line in front of Birney's corps, which moved forward and occupied some of the Confederate entrenchments and captured four guns.
Although the Union attacks had been generally unsuccessful, they had some of the effect Grant desired. Lee became convinced that the threat against Richmond was a serious one and they began moving troops to the front. They dispatched two infantry brigades of Maj. Gen. William Mahone's division and the cavalry divisions of Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton and W.H.F. "Rooney" Lee. Grant ordered Hancock to resume their attacks on August 15 and Hancock decided to continue with their emphasis on the Confederate left. They ordered Birney's corps to make a night march to join Barlow's end of the line. Although it was raining that night, the oppressive heat continued and more than a third of Birney's men fell out of the column.
August 15–16
Birney's movement was delayed by difficult terrain for most of August 15 and Hancock's plan for an early morning attack had to be abandoned. They reached Fussell's Mill around 1 p.m. and Birney spent the entire afternoon performing a reconnaissance while their men recovered from their march. After this, Birney judged that it was too late in the day to attack.
Early on the morning of August 16, Gregg's cavalry swept to the right to Glendale and then rode northwest on the Charles City Road toward Richmond. They found Rooney Lee's cavalry division blocking the road and a full day of fighting resulted. The Union cavalrymen drove the enemy as far as White's Tavern, but were eventually pushed back to Fisher's Farm. Confederate Brig. Gen. John R. Chambliss was killed during the fighting. The infantrymen of the X Corps had a better start to the day, as Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry's division, led by Col. Francis Bates Pond's brigade, broke through the Confederate line. Wright's Brigade, commanded by newly promoted Brig. Gen. Victor Girardey, was hit hard and retreated, opening a significant gap. Girardey was killed by a bullet in the head while brandishing the colors of the 64th Georgia. Field later wrote, "Not only the day but Richmond seemed to be gone." The heavily wooded terrain prevented Birney and Hancock from understanding that they had reached a position of advantage and they were unable to exploit it before Field rearranged their lines to fill the gap and drive back the Federals. Col. William C. Oates led two Alabama regiments in the initial counterattack and was wounded. Robert E. Lee had arrived north of the James by this time and witnessed the action.
August 17–20
No fighting occurred on August 17 and a truce was called to allow the two sides to retrieve their dead and wounded. Lee planned a counterattack against the Union right for 11 a.m. on August 18, a cavalry attack on the Charles City Road accompanied by an infantry attack at Fussell's Mill. The effort was poorly coordinated and the cavalry was not ready to move until 5 p.m. Neither the cavalry nor the infantry made any significant gains before dark. That night Hancock sent a II Corps division back to Petersburg to man a part of the trench line while other units were sent from there to the Battle of Globe Tavern at the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad south of the city. By the night of August 20, having observed no more actions by Lee, Hancock withdrew their force back over the James.
Aftermath
Union casualties were approximately 2,900 men, some due to heat stroke. Confederate casualties were 1,500. General Gregg, Brig. Gen. John R. Chambliss's classmate at West Point, took charge of the cavalryman's body and later sent it through the lines to Chambliss's widow. As at the First Battle of Deep Bottom, the Federal assault had failed against a smaller defensive force. However, the operation had compelled General Lee to detach forces from Petersburg and Bermuda Hundred to deal with the Union advance, preventing them as well from reinforcing Early in the Shenandoah Valley.
Battlefield preservation
The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Second Deep Bottom battlefield as of November 2021. The battlefield is just 11 miles southeast of Richmond but looks much as it did during the Civil War. The house and land around Fussell's Mill, where there was heavy fighting, has been preserved by the Richmond Battlefield Association.

Doris Ruby (1927 – December 16, 1951) was a 24-year-old dancer from Sunnyside, Queens who died in the 1951 Miami Airlines C-46 crash. They were a popular nightclub entertainer.
Club performer
They opened at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem in late April 1951. Ruby appeared with Fran Warren and Danny Thomas at the Latin Casino in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in early May. They teamed with
George Price and Betty Reilly at the Capri in Atlantic Beach, New York in mid-June. They were romantically linked to Paul Thomas, brother of Danny Thomas, at this time.
Untimely death
Ruby was booked to dance at the Vagabond Club, on Biscayne Boulevard, in Miami, Florida, the week after their death. They had most recently appeared at the Cafe Society
in New York City. They appeared briefly on WJZ prior to preparing for their fatal flight to Florida. WJZ had broadcast from Howie's Restaurant on the Avenue of the Americas between 52nd and 53rd Streets in Manhattan. They had been in Hanson's Drug Store, 51st Street and 7th Avenue, only a few hours prior to boarding the
plane. This was a popular celebrity hangout.
Gregg Sherwood, showgirl and best friend of Ruby, tried to discourage them
from flying the night before their death. Sherwood told Ruby that if they had ten days before their Miami opening they could likely get a cancellation on a better airline. 56 people died on the nonscheduled airliner which crashed in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
The American Guild of Variety Artists held a benefit for Ruby's family, who were destitute following their death. They were their main support. Walter Winchell reported that Ruby might have flown to Florida earlier if the last night club they appeared in had paid them on time. AGVA, the actors' union, paid them out of the owners' bond (to guarantee wages). This occurred belatedly, a week after they made flying plans.

Arthur Williams (February 24, 1934 – February 8, 1979) was a professional baseball umpire who worked in the National League (NL) from 1972 to 1977, and was the first African-American umpire in the NL, wearing number 25 during their career. Williams umpired 806 Major League Baseball (MLB) games in their six-year career. They also umpired in the 1975 National League Championship Series.
Biography
Career
Art Williams had pitched high school baseball in Bakersfield, California. They entered minor league baseball, but suffered a career-ending elbow injury. They were umpiring local recreational baseball in Bakersfield when a former scout for the San Francisco Giants encouraged them to attend umpire school. They attended umpire school in 1969 and then began umpiring in the minor leagues.
Williams became the first black umpire in the NL when they worked 19 games at the end of the 1972 season. They were promoted to full-time status when the NL purchased their contract from the Triple-A International League on March 21, 1973. They were assigned to the postseason once, working the 1975 National League Championship Series. They were fired after the 1977 season, having worked 806 games in six MLB seasons. They remained the only black NL umpire in their last season. At a hearing a few months after their firing, they claimed that their dismissal may have been motivated by racism. They said that, with the planned promotion of umpire Eric Gregg, the league did not want to accommodate two black umpires among its ranks. A complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was still pending at the time of their death.
Death
Williams drove a bus in Bakersfield until they suffered a seizure in the fall of 1978. They underwent brain surgery and was in a coma for six weeks until their death on February 8, 1979.

Nick Gill (born 25 August 1982) is a former professional Australian rules football player who played for the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). They were originally drafted by Melbourne in the 2000 pre-season draft but was delisted at the end of 2001. They then spent 2002 playing with Port Melbourne in the VFL and after a good season was selected by the Kangaroos in the 2002 rookie draft. They were again delisted after only one season and in 2004 returned to play for the North Adelaide Roosters where they were runner-up in the Magarey Medal in 2005.
AFL career
Their 2006 form with North Adelaide Roosters was not the best but impressive results at the South Australian state screening saw them drafted by the Crows with the 64th pick of the 2006 AFL Draft. The Crows also drafted Gill as a mature-age recruit to act as insurance for the injured Trent Hentschel.
Despite not having the best of starts after being plagued by hamstring injuries at the start of the season, Gill eventually worked their way back into form to be picked for their first game in a forward pocket for the Round 17 clash against the Essendon Football Club in 2007.
In 2008 Gill was in and out of the side, becoming a fixture late in the season due to injuries to several key forwards.
Gill but struggled with injuries in 2009, and was unable to break into a suddenly potent Adelaide forward line. At the end of the season, they were one of five players delisted by Adelaide.
Gill played for the North Hobart Football Club during the 2013 TSL season.
Radio
Nick was part of the SAFM breakfast show with Hayley, Rabbit & Cosi as the sports guru in Adelaide. In 2014 they replaced Ali Carle on Triple M Adelaide's Hot Breakfast. Nick currently hosts Hit 106.9 Newcastle's Breakfast Show with Jess Farchione & Ducko.

KFMH (101.9 FM, "Kool 101.9") is a radio station licensed to serve Belle Fourche, South Dakota. The station serves Rapid City, South Dakota, with an on-channel broadcast booster licensed as KFMH-FM1. The station is owned by Oregon Trail Broadcasting, LLC, through licensee Bad Lands Broadcasting Company, Inc. KFMH broadcasts a classic hits music format.
History
This station received its original construction permit for a new FM station broadcasting with 25,000 watts of effective radiated power at 102.1 MHz from the Federal Communications Commission on March 28, 2000—nearly six years after the application had been first filed. The new station was assigned the call letters KFMH by the FCC on May 7, 2002. KFMH received its license to cover from the FCC on September 10, 2003.
In April 2004, MAS Communications, Inc. (Mark A. Swendsen, president) agreed to sell this station to Laramie Mountain Broadcasting, LLC (Victor A. Michael, president) for a reported sale price of $250,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 4, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on June 25, 2004.
The station previously operated under the branding "B102" with a similar oldies music format.
In July 2004, the station received a new construction permit to change broadcast frequencies from 102.1 MHz to the current 101.9 MHz.
In June 2005, Laramie Mountain Broadcasting, LLC, had reached an agreement to sell this station to Bad Lands Broadcasting Company, Inc., for a reported sale price of $915,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on September 6, 2005.
However, the sale of KFMH was contingent upon Bad Lands Broadcasting Company acquiring KRKI from Michaels Radio Group and ongoing technical issues have forced Laramie Mountain Broadcasting to file for a series of 90-day "extension of consummation" approvals with the FCC. The latest such filing was made on December 21, 2009, and as such the sale was still pending at that point. As part of this filing, Laramie Mountain Broadcasting and Bad Lands Broadcasting Company state that they have "resolved the interference issues that were delaying closing" and that both companies are "currently finalizing resolution of other outstanding issues".
The sale to Bad Lands Broadcasting was eventually consummated on May 17, 2013; the transaction involved Laramie Mountain Broadcasting acquiring KKAW and KREO from Bad Lands Broadcasting, in exchange for Bad Lands receiving KFMH and $100,000 from Laramie.

The road network in Windsor, Ontario is a grid system with elongated blocks, generally aligned with the Detroit River, with East-West roads running parallel to it, and North-South streets running perpendicular (90 Degrees) to it. This is an adoption from when French Canadian settlers first built farms and streets in the area. Many streets have French names in result, such as Lauzon Parkway, Marentette Avenue (a quiet residential street), Ouellette Avenue (considered by many Windsorites to be its "Main Street"), and Pelissier Street. The current street system of Windsor (grid with elongated blocks) reflects the French method of agricultural land division where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river (this originates from French methods of tax collection, with more taxes being paid by property owners with waterfront properties, thus why riverfront lots were usually narrow).
Introduction
Most of the city is uniform in its grid, but a few neighbourhoods have their own system. Forest Glade and The Villages of Riverside were built recently (in the 1960s and 1970s, and have circular patterns, while Sandwich has its own grid roughly 45 degrees off from the rest of the city, in a triangle from Huron Church Road and the Detroit River, south to Tecumseh Road and Prince Road. This is due to the river turning southwest-ward just west of the Ambassador Bridge. Another major part of the city where the streets "jog" across Tecumseh Road is Fountain Bleu, when Tecumseh Road was the former city limit with the former Township of Sandwich South until the 1960s.
Expressways
Windsor has one freeway, the E. C. Row Expressway.
Highway 401 skirts the City Limits from Provincial Rd (exit 14). to Cabana West/Todd Lane (exit 6), and enters the city in the far west end to Ojibway Pkwy. (exit 1). A former spur, Highway 3B, now known as Dougall Parkway is a limited access freeway between the 401 and Howard Avenue. Just north of Howard Avenue, Dougall Parkway becomes Dougall Avenue.
There are a few other divided highways/dual carriageways with varying levels of development, access, and intersections, such as Ojibway Parkway, Lauzon Parkway, Ouellette Avenue, and Huron Church Road.
Main East-West Roads
These main East-West arterial roads are listed from the Detroit River, heading towards the south:
Riverside Drive
University Avenue
Wyandotte Street
Tecumseh Road
Eugenie Street (short, but very busy connector)
E. C. Row Expressway
Cabana Road/Division Road
Other East-West Roads
Erie Street
Giles Boulevard
Ottawa Street
Shepherd Street
Grand Marais Road/West Grand Boulevard
Plymouth Road (originally built to direct traffic from the now-demolished Pillette Road Van plant away from residential areas to the north and east)
Dougall Parkway (leads to Ontario Highway 401, serves South Windsor and Southwood Lakes subdivision)
North Talbot Road
Totten Street
College Avenue (a busy truck route)
Prince Road (continuation of Totten Street, meets up with Tecumseh Road)
Forest Glade Drive
Wildwood Drive
Main North-South Roads
These main North-South arteries are listed from west to east:
Sandwich Street
Matchette Road
Malden Road
Huron Church Road (extremely busy connector linking Ontario Highway 401 to Ambassador Bridge and Interstate 75)
Campbell Avenue/Dominion Boulevard (originally intended to become a freeway in the 1970s as a spur route from E.C. Row into downtown, anti-freeway sentiments by downtown and west side residents and businesses killed it)
Dougall Avenue
Ouellette Avenue
McDougall Avenue
Howard Avenue
Provincial Road
Banwell Road
Walker Road
Central Avenue
Pillette Road
Jefferson Boulevard
Lauzon Road/Lauzon Parkway
Other North-South Roads
These other North-South routes tend to be short, but busy, as they serve heavily built-up areas in Downtown and other areas:
Victoria Avenue (notable for having some of the oldest houses in the city along it. It is a quiet downtown residential street otherwise)
Drouillard Road/Chrysler Center
Many of these roads in Windsor pass by Big Three Automaker plants, such as Ford Motor Company of Canada, General Motors Canada and Chrysler Canada, which is why they are so busy.

Sophie Hackett (born 1971) is the Curator of Photography at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto.
Career
Sophie Hackett was born in Montreal, Quebec. They completed their BA at the University of Toronto (1990-1994) but became interested in photography and earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Photography at the Emily Carr Institute of Art & Design, Vancouver (1995-1998). After graduation, they worked for the Jane Corkin Gallery in Toronto from 1998–2000, followed by a Curatorial Internship, Photography, at the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) (2002–2003), then did their Master of Arts, Humanities (Art History) at the University of Chicago (2003–2004). In 2005-2006, they were appointed a J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles Graduate Intern in the Department of Photographs, then became Assistant Curator, Photography, at the AGO (2006–2013), Associate Curator (2013-2016) and in 2016, they were appointed full Curator, Photography, taking over from Maia-Mari Sutnik and actively curating, contributing to publications, and participating on juries, both national and international. Hackett's area of specialization is vernacular photography, photography in relation to queerness; and photography in Canada from the 1960s to the 1990s.
They also have served as an adjunct faculty member in Ryerson University's Master's degree program in Film + Photography Preservation and Collections Management, and was a 2017 Fellow with the Center for Curatorial Leadership. They were a juror four times for the Grange Prize / Aimia AGO Photography Prize in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2017. They also served as a juror for the Scotiabank Photography Award for 2020 (Dana Claxton), 2021 (Deanna Bowen) and upcoming for 2022.
Exhibitions
Although Hackett`s first major show was in 2002 with the touring exhibition The Found and the Familiar: Snapshots in Contemporary Canadian Art at Gallery TPW (Hackett served on the Board of Gallery TPW from 2007–2019 (2011–2019 as president)), they only began to achieve critical attention with such shows as What It Means To be Seen: Photography and Queer Visibility and Fan the Flames: Queer Positions in Photography, two exhibitions which they assembled in 2014 as part of the AGO's World Pride 2014 programming and Outsiders: American Photography and Film, 1950s–1980s, which they co-curated, in 2016. In 2018, they curated Anthropocene at the same time as the National Gallery of Canada to chronicle the irreversible impact of humans on the Earth accompanied by a film and book by Edward Burtynsky, Jennifer Baichwal, and Nicholas de Pencier, and in 2020, they curated and hung a major exhibition of Diane Arbus titled Diane Arbus: Photographs, 1956–1971 which the Globe and Mail called a tasteful, chronological display. The exhibition featured 150 photographs which the AGO acquired in 2016 along with another 300-odd photographs by Arbus, making the AGO a major center of Arbus photographs but the show was quickly closed due to the pandemic. Forthcoming in 2022 will be another Hackett show: What Matters Most: Photographs of Black Life, the Fade Resistance Collection, at AGO. This group of 3500 Polaroids documenting African American family life from the 1970s to the early 2000s, was assembled by Canadian photographer, physician and educator Zun Lee and acquired by the AGO in 2018.
Writing
Hackett's distinctive voice can be found in essays for catalogues of shows in which they were the curator or co-curator such as What It Means to be Seen: Photography and Queer Visibility, Ryerson Image Centre, Toronto, in 2014 which the Globe and Mail said put the identities of LGBT artists in context; and the essay and short texts for each of the artists they wrote for the catalogue of the Outsiders: American Photography and Film, 1950s–1980s exhibition in 2016 at the Art Gallery of Ontario (she acted as co-editor of the book/catalogue which accompanied the show as well). Other major texts by Hackett can be found in books such their essay "A New Scene in Montreal", in the book by Tavi Gevinson (Georgiana Uhlyarik, Ed.) Introducing Suzy Lake (London and Toronto: Black Dog Publishing and the Art Gallery of Ontario, 2014) and articles such as "Queer Looking: Joan E. Biren's Slide Shows", Aperture, no. 218 (spring 2015) as well as "Encounters in the Museum: The Experience of Photographic Objects" in the Ryerson Image Centre and MIT Press volume The "Public" Life of Photographs (Toronto and Boston, 2016) (here they relayed an account of the formation of the photography department at the AGO and its particular character) and are found in many other publications such as their "Bobbie in Context" chapter in Imagining Everyday Life: Engagements with Vernacular Photography (Steidl and The Walther Collection, 2020).
Recognition
Them exhibitions are praised for the satisfactions they provide in revealing the AGO collection of more than 40,000 photographs and Hackett for jumping "deftly between eras, materials, subjects and genres, laying bare both the ubiquity of the photographic image, and the form's persistent plasticity" as well as for defying cliché in presenting "thoughtful and political" views of gay culture. In addition, their exhibition of Introducing Suzy Lake which they co-curated with Georgiana Uhlyarik won the 2015 Ontario Association of Art Galleries prize for exhibition installation and design.

Spring Gulch is a cross-country ski area located on Thompson Creek Road in northwestern Pitkin County, Colorado, six miles west of Carbondale, Colorado, USA. The ski area shares its name with a historical 19th and early 20th century coal mining townsite, Spring Gulch, which is in the vicinity mostly to the south of the ski area proper. The area is run by the non-profit Mount Sopris Nordic Council for the benefit of community members and visitors. Use of the area is free of cost and limited to cross-country skiing activities.
The terrain consists primarily of rolling trails among gambel oak and aspen trees. Views of the nearby Mount Sopris and Elk Mountains are visible from some of the higher trails. The area was formed in cooperation with the local North Thompson Cattlemen's Association, which owns the land and uses it for summer grazing, during which time it is closed to all recreational use. Notable annual events include the Ski for Sisu fundraiser, the Alpine Bank Classic high school Junior Olympic qualifiers, and the Colorado Rocky Mountain School Rat Race.
Spring Gulch is the primary training ground for the Nordic team at CRMS.

Tullahassee Mission was a Presbyterian mission and school, founded on March 1, 1850 in the Creek Nation, Indian Territory by Robert Loughridge. This Presbyterian minister had been serving there since 1843, when they founded Koweta Mission. This mission was also originally built for Muscogee Creek students, and the community of Tullahassee developed there.
After a devastating fire in 1880, the Muscogee transferred their children to Wealaka, another mission school. The community of Tullahassee had become increasingly settled by descendants of Creek Freedmen, and the number of Muscogee had declined there. The Muscogee gave the Tullahassee mission and community to the Creek Freedmen, and it is one of the few surviving all-black towns in the state. The Muscogee paid to replace the damaged main Tullahassee building.
It reopened in 1883 as Tullahassee Manual Labor School. After statehood, the federal government took over control of the property and sold it in 1914 to Wagoner County. In 1916 the African Methodist Episcopal Church bought the property for use as Flipper-Key-Davis College. The private junior college was the only institution in the state for higher education for African Americans. It closed in 1935 during the Great Depression.
History
While in the Southeast and soon after removal, most Muscogee Creek were opposed to all European-American missionaries and their schools, as they did not want their traditional culture disrupted by Christianity. But in 1842 the Creek Council had authorized Loughridge to set up a mission in Coweta, in order to get the associated school to educate their children. They returned in 1843 and founded Koweta Mission after the town. After assessing this school, the Creek Council allowed Loughridge in 1850 to establish another mission, Tullahassee, northwest of the community of Muskogee.
The Creek said they would pay one-fifth of the cost from their annuities; the rest would be covered by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions. Loughridge chose the site for Tullahassee Mission and purchased of land from Thomas Marshall to support the complex. As at other boarding schools, students and staff would raise their own food and livestock on the facility.
A three-storey, brick building was constructed on the site. It housed 80 students, primarily full-blood Creek. Opened in 1850, it was operated as an Indian boarding school for the next three decades to train both "full- blood" and "mixed-blood" Muscogee students. The latter generally had some European ancestry and were often descendants of traders who had married into the tribe in previous decades.
Transfer of school to Creek Freedmen
During this period the community changed; after the Civil War, Creek Freedmen gathered in certain communities, among them Tullahassee, and outnumbered Muscogee Creek. The main Tullahassee building was largely destroyed by an accidental fire in December 1880. The Muscogee Creek Council relocated their children to a new school, Wealaka Mission, as their population had been declining in Tullahassee.
They offered the former school and its improved plot to the Creek Freedmen as a school for their children. The Council also paid to replace the burned main building and essentially turned over the community to the freedmen.
The Muscogee children were transferred to Wealaka Mission in 1881. The tribal leaders turned over the former mission building to Creek freedmen on October 24, 1881.
The school reopened in 1883 for Creek Freedmen and their descendants as Tullahassee Manual Labor School. Additional funding was contributed by the Baptist Home Mission Society. The freedmen had the town incorporated in 1902 and recruited more African-American freedmen from the South as settlers.
Much of the Creek lands (including that assigned to Creek freedmen) had been allotted to households by the early 20th century. In 1906, to extinguish tribal land claims and organization in preparation for Oklahoma to be admitted as a state, the federal government dissolved Creek institutions, including its school system.
Tullahassee Manual Labor School was the only school in the former Creek Nation to remain temporarily open for descendants of Creek freedmen and other African Americans. In 1908 the US government took over ownership of the site via the United States Department of Interior, which by then had been authorized by Congress to have responsibility for Indian trust lands and treaties. Interior sold the property in 1914 to Wagoner County, Oklahoma for local uses.
In 1916, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (the first independent black denomination in the United States, established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) founded Flipper-Key-Davis College in Tullahassee. It was permitted to use the former mission building for the school. This was the only private school for higher education for African Americans in Oklahoma at the time. The college closed at the end of the 1935 school year, during the Great Depression, when many institutions had financial difficulties.
An informal sign marks the Tullahassee Creek Indian Cemetery, established by 1883 near the mission site. In the 21st century, the small community of Tullahassee is considered the oldest of the surviving thirteen all-black towns in former Indian Territory.

This is a list of mountain peaks ordered by their topographic prominence.
Terminology
The prominence of a peak is the minimum height of climb to the summit on any route from a higher peak, or from sea level if there is no higher peak. The lowest point on that route is the col.
For full definitions and explanations of topographic prominence, key col, and parent, see topographic prominence. In particular, the different definitions of the parent of a peak are addressed at length in that article. Height on the other hand simply means elevation of the summit above sea level.
Regarding parents, the prominence parent of peak A can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories, by tracing the runoff from the key col (mountain pass) of every peak that is more prominent than peak A. The parent is the peak whose territory peak A resides in.
The encirclement parent is found by tracing the contour below peak A's key col and picking the highest mountain in that region. This is easier to determine than the prominence parent; however, it tends to give non-intuitive results for peaks with very low cols such as Jabal Shams which is #110 in the list.
Note that either sort of parent of a typical very high-prominence peak such as Denali will lie far away from the peak itself, reflecting the independence of the peak.
Most sources (and the table below) define no parent for island and landmass highpoints; others treat Mount Everest as the parent of every such peak with the ocean as the "key col".
Prominence table
The following table lists the Earth's 125 most topographically prominent summits. Of these, China has the most: 16. Close behind it are Indonesia, with 13, and the United States with 12.
Additional peaks
The list of peaks that follows is not complete, but the peaks are all notable. Note that island high points (whose prominence is equal to their elevation) can be found at the List of islands by highest point; hence most are not included below. Some well-known peaks listed here do not score highly by prominence.
All peaks with a prominence of more than 1,500 metres rank as an Ultra. For a complete listing of all 1,524 peaks with prominence greater than this level, see the lists of Ultras.
In the table, the prominence parent is marked "1", and the encirclement parent "2". Where a single parent is listed, the different definitions agree.

Notes
*.By convention, cols created by human activity are not counted. Therefore, the Suez, Panama and other canals are ignored in these calculations. Cuts that lower the natural elevations of mountain passes are also ignored. Towers, monuments and similar on the peaks are also ignored.

The 2021 24 Hours of Daytona (formally the 2021 Rolex 24 at Daytona) was an endurance sports car race sanctioned by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA). The event was held at Daytona International Speedway combined road course in Daytona Beach, Florida, on January 30–31, 2021. This event was the 59th running of the 24 Hours of Daytona, and the first of 12 races across multiple classes in the 2021 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, as well as the first of four rounds in the 2021 Michelin Endurance Cup.
Entries
With the addition of the Le Mans Prototype 3 (LMP3) class, despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of entrants to the 24-hour race saw a marked improvement from the 2020 running of the event, with 50 entries registered. There were seven entries in the Daytona Prototype International (DPi) class, ten in LMP2, seven in LMP3, six in GT Le Mans (GTLM), and 20 in GT Daytona (GTD). Some notable entries include Chip Ganassi Racing, who are registered to participate in the Daytona Prototype international (DPi) class with the Cadillac DPi-V.R. This marks Chip Ganassi Racing's return to top-level sportscar competition in America after a one-year absence following the withdrawal of their Ford GTE program at the end of the 2019 season, and their first race in prototypes since the 2016 edition of the 24-hour race.
The Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) class also saw a flourish of international interest, with ten entries registered, the highest entry count since LMP2 was made its own class. Several of the teams, such as DragonSpeed, Racing Team Nederland, and High Class Racing, are mainstays of the FIA World Endurance Championship. Many of the LMP2 driver rosters include world-class drivers, such as Nicolas Lapierre, Giedo van der Garde, and Ben Hanley, among others.
The entry count would drop to 49 for the race itself. Just prior to the testing weekend, the team owner of Porsche GT Daytona entrant Black Swan Racing, Tim Pappas, tested positive for COVID-19. They had contracted it after racing in the 2021 Dubai 24-Hour event two weeks prior. As a safety precaution, Pappas withdrew the entire team, which consisted of himself, Porsche factory driver Patrick Pilet, Patrick Lindsey, and Larry ten Voorde, who also tested positive for COVID-19 shortly after Pappas.
Pre-Race
Balance of Performance
Prior to the 24-hour race, and indeed the mandatory testing session that came a week prior, IMSA released a technical bulletin regarding the Balance of Performance for the 24 Hours of Daytona. Every year a unique set of BoP constraints are determined exclusively for the 24-hour event, due to the unique challenges the length of the race brings relative to the other events in the IMSA calendar. There was a large focus on changes in the GT classes. After winning both the 2019 and 2020 editions of the Rolex, the BMW M8 GTE was put at a 10-kilogram weight disadvantage, along with restricted levels of turbo boost. Meanwhile, the Porsche 911 RSR and Chevrolet Corvette C8.R were both given increases in the sizes of their air restrictors, with the latter being made 10 kilograms lighter. In GTD, several cars had their constraints changed, most notably the Porsche 911 GT3 R and 2020-edition-winning Lamborghini Huracan GT3. The former was given a hefty 20-kilogram weight increase, and the latter would run at restricted power levels.

Archives on public display
On September 17, 2009 the National Geographic Image Collection opened its first exhibition of vintage National Geographic images at the Steven Kasher Gallery in Chelsea, New York. 150 vintage prints, many of which were never published in National Geographic Magazine, from a dozen photographers, were on display. The images, which make up a collective portrait of the Society's early years, are stored in a windowless, climate-controlled, underground archive with roots reaching back more than a century.
The National Geographic Image Collection archive also includes glass-plate negatives and auto chromes, the earliest examples of color photography. In a walk-in refrigerated vault near the main archive room, the Image Collection stores hundreds of thousands of 35mm color transparencies and negatives, and it is now storing hundreds of thousands more digital images on hard drives.
National Geographic: The Image Collection Book
On October 2, 2009 the National Geographic Image Collection released the largest single volume of world-renowned National Geographic photographs published by the organization. The 500-page National Geographic Image Collection showcases 120 years of world history, natural history and culture chronicled and preserved in the Society's unique archive of more than 11.5 million images. The work of 204 photographers includes approximately 400 color and black-and-white images that are presented and divided into four themes: Exploration, Wildlife, People & Culture, and Science & Climate Change. A behind-the-scenes profile of the entire Image Collection, including auto chromes, glass color transparencies, black-and-white prints, color transparencies and digital media is also covered in the book.
Agency overview
The National Geographic Image Collection represents hundreds of National Geographic photographers, writers, and artists. It acts as the photographers representative to market, license, and promote commercial and editorial assignment work. The National Geographic Image Collection generates ancillary income for the photographers, illustrators, and/or writers and collects a commission on all sales.
The National Geographic Image Collection represents photographers, artists, and writers who have signed a contract allowing the National Geographic Image Collection to act as their agent, or whose material was created while they were on staff at NGS.

The Bill Wilson Center (BWC) is a nonprofit organization in Santa Clara, California, that provides support to homeless and runaway children and young adults.
History
Early history
It was founded in 1973 by Bill Wilson, who was a Santa Clara councilman and mayor from 1963–1971. Wilson assisted in founding a counseling center for children at Buchser Middle School. Initially called Webster's Education Center when the institutors were attempting to determine the organization's name, it was renamed to the Bill Wilson Center after their unexpected death in 1977 in their early 40s. In 1977, the center obtained a house that acted as a shelter for at most six homeless youth.
The Bill Wilson Center's director is Sparky Harlan. They joined the organization as its director in 1983. When they joined, the organization faced an imminent loss of 50% of its annual $300,000 budget; they were able to prevent the budget cut. In July 1993, they moved the center to The Alameda in Santa Clara, which unified its shelter and counseling center to be in the same location. The move also expanded its capacity from being able to house at most 16 homeless children, up from six. In 2012, the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs named Harlan a Champion of Change, an award given to people who help homeless children.
According to the San Jose Mercury News, the Bill Wilson Center was the first organization in the Santa Clara Valley to "provide comprehensive services -- including transitional housing -- for this often-invisible population" of homeless youth. The organization receives most of its funding from government grants. Since it is uncertain whether the funds will be maintained or augmented to address the children's growing needs, the Bill Wilson Center solicits donations from people and corporations.
2000s
In 2012, the Bill Wilson Center finished developing Peacock Commons, a two-story, 28-unit housing complex for homeless young adults between 18 and 25. It bought the complex in 2007 and began renovating it in February 2012. Residents began moving into Peacock Commons in April 2012. Rent is subsidized by Santa Clara County Mental Health and paid on a sliding scale. On May 23, 2012, Santa Clara County Mental Health Board gave the Bill Wilson Center a Community Service Award.
In 2014, the organization helped 3,512 people. During meals, caseworkers meet with the youths and counsel them on various topics like resumes and drug addictions. Between 80% to 89% of the people they helped in 2014 were able to rejoin their families or move into stable housing.

Sir Edmund James Palmer Norton (1865–1944) was an engineer of English descent who was born on the frontier between Germany and Denmark, though raised in England.  They are credited as a pioneer of Argentine viticulture.
Transandine Railway
After graduating with a degree in engineering their expertise in building railway bridges was requested to help build the Transandine Railway which connected the Argentine railroad from Mendoza to Santiago, Chile. This line, climbing through the Andes through a 12,000-foot pass, was built in one of the most difficult railroad terrains in the world. Though the railway has not been functional since 1984, in 2006, both the Argentine and Chilean governments agreed to refurbish the railway and make it functional by the year 2010, at an estimated total cost of US$460 million.
Argentine viticulture
Once their work on the railway was completed, they moved to Bahía Blanca before returning to Mendoza in 1889 to settle permanently. Though their formal training was in designing railway bridges, they soon sought other opportunities. In 1895 they founded the very first winery in the area, Bodega Norton, located to the south of the Mendoza River in the district of Perdriel, in the department of Luján de Cuyo. Norton recognized the Mendoza region's potential for wine cultivation and production, and planted grapes with vines imported from France. They devoted the rest of their life to winemaking. They married Juana Suarez and had several children, some of whom continued the family business.
Bodega Norton
In 1989, Bodega Norton was acquired by Austrian entrepreneur Gernot Langes–Swarovski, owner of Swarovski Crystal Company. Bodega Norton now exports over 1.5 million cases annually.

Neacșu's letter (), written in 1521, is the oldest surviving document available in Old Romanian that can be reliably dated. Written using Cyrillic, it was sent by Lupu Neacșu, a merchant from Câmpulung, Wallachia (now Romania) to Johannes Benkner, the mayor of Brassó, Kingdom of Hungary (now Brașov, Romania), warning them about the imminent attack of the Ottoman Empire on the city of Belgrad and its implications to regional politics.
Lupu Neacșu was the son of Mircea Neacșu, mentioned for the first time during Vlad cel Tânăr's reign (1510–1512), in documents related to a trial regarding debts between themselves and merchants of Brașov. It is possible that they were themselves a merchant involved in the trade of Turkish goods that they were buying south of the Danube and selling in Transylvania, which may explain their relationship with the mayor of Brașov.
History
The Letter of Neacșu of Câmpulung to Johannes (Hans) Benkner of Brașov was most probably written on June 29 or 30, 1521, in the city of Dlăgopole (Old Bulgarian rendition/translation of Câmpulung, lit. "the long field"). The date is not mentioned within the letter itself, it being inferred from the historic events described and the people mentioned.
The letter was discovered in 1894 by Wilhelm Stenner, the archivar of Brașov.
Contents
The text of the letter was written in the Cyrillic script, and is composed of three parts. The introduction in Old Church Slavonic, translated: "To the most wise and noble and venerable and by God endowed master Hanas Begner of Brașov, all the best, from Neacșu of Câmpulung".
Following the Slavonic introduction, the content of the letter is written in the old Romanian language. As opposed to the first documents of other languages, which are in general more ancient, the Romanian language used in this letter is very similar to the language spoken in the present day. The Romanian linguist Aurel Nicolescu stated that no less than 175 words of the 190 found in the letter have Latin origins, this is not counting the repeated words and the names. Some incorrect forms of different words appear due to the difficulty of representing some Romanian sounds like ă and î, while using the Cyrillic alphabet.
Lupu Neacșu's letter contained a secret of great importance, warning Johannes Benkner of Brașov about Turkish preparations for an invasion through Transylvania and Wallachia.
Another two Slavonic expressions are also present throughout the content of the letter: "I pak", meaning "and again" and having a similar function as the Latin "item", being also used to mark the beginning of a new sentence, and also the word "za", meaning about.
The letter ends with another sentence written in Bulgarian, which means: "And may God bring happiness upon you. Amen."

Spiraea tomentosa, commonly known as steeplebush, meadowsweet, or hardhack, or eastern hardhack, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States and Canada.
Description
Spiraea tomentosa grows to up to four feet high and prefers moist to wet soil and full sun. It blooms in summer. Each tiny, pink flower is about 1/16 of an inch wide and arranged in narrow, pyramid-shaped flowerheads that grow up to eight inches long. The flowers are followed by small, dry, brown fruit. The specific epithet tomentosa refers to the undersides of the leaves and the stems, which are covered in a dense white-woolly tomentum. It has similar characteristics to Spiraea douglasii.
Ecology
The plant bug Plagiognathus fuscosus breeds on steeplebush. Many bees visit the flowers: Apis mellifera (non-native), Bombus griseocollis, Bombus impatiens, Lasioglossum atwoodi, Lasioglossum hitchensi, and Hylaeus mesillae.
Uses
Steeplebush is noted for its astringent properties, which cause it to be used medicinally.
The hardiness zone for this plant is listed as zones 4 to 8.

The nyatiti is a five to eight-stringed plucked bowl yoke lute from Kenya. It is a classical instrument played by the Luo people of Western Kenya, specifically in the Siaya region south of Kisumu. It is about two to three feet long with a bowl-shaped, carved wood resonator covered in cow skin. Historically, strings were fashioned from cattle tendons, but modern players almost exclusively use nylon and plastic fishing line of various sizes, a move which changed the sound of the nyatiti drastically.
The nyatiti as played in Kenya usually has eight strings. Though the register will vary to match a comfortable singing range of the player, a typical tuning will be, from top to bottom, B-A-G#-E-E-D-B-A, where the outside strings are the same note at the same pitch, and the middle two are an octave apart. Many modern players use individual tunings to match their particular musical style. The most common playing style uses the thumb and middle finger of both hands, alternating between the two to create a rhythmic and circular musical pattern.
If played in a traditional style, the performer sits on a short, shin level chair called the orindi. They or they wear a wrought iron ring called the oduong'o around the big toe of the right foot and the gara, a set of metal bells also on the right leg. With the gara and the oduong'o, the player maintains a constant beat, banging the iron ring on the bottom bar of the nyatiti.
The nyatiti is usually played alone. Some players have, in the past, been accompanied by a number of male back-up singers (chorus). Though not common, the nyatiti can be accompanied by any number of traditional instruments, including a curved horn called the oporo or tung''', a single-string violin-like instrument called the orutu, and percussion. Modern day players will often integrate the instrument in with Western-style guitar, bass, keyboards and drums.
Traditionally, players wear a headdress called Kondo, which is fashioned out of goat fur. Dancers sometimes accompany the nyatiti player and wear brightly colored skirts called Owalo''. Younger players often forgo the traditional dress, opting for clothes typical of present-day performances.
Some maintain that music from the nyatiti inspired what became benga music.

A cinematheque is an archive of films and film-related objects with an exhibition venue. Similarly to a book library (bibliothèque in French), a cinematheque is responsible for preserving and making available to the public film heritage. Typically, a cinematheque has at least one motion picture theatre, which offers screenings of its collections and other international films.
History
From the first cinema screenings until 1930, several attempts to establish film archives were initiated in Europe, the USA and Russia. As early as 1898, the photographer and cameraman Bolesław Matuszewski evoked the idea of a film archive. "It is a matter of giving this perhaps privileged source of history the same authority, the same official existence, the same access as to other archives already known". The "Archives of the Planet” (Les Archives de la planète) were established by Albert Kahn, between 1912 and 1931. Military film archives were also created in France, Germany and Great Britain after the First World War. The cinematheque of the city of Paris, for educational purposes, was created in 1925.
However, it was not until the 1930s and the awareness of the destruction of films at the time of the transition to sound movies that the first film archives emerged. Some of the first formal film archives were created: in Stockholm in 1933, the Reichsfilmarchiv in Berlin in 1934, the National Film Library in London and the Film Library at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1935, the Cinémathèque française in Paris created in 1936. In 1938, the International Federation of Film Archives was created, bringing together institutions devoted to cinematographic heritage. On 27 October 1980, the General Conference of UNESCO adopted the "Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images" which recognizes the need to preserve and provide access to cinematographic heritage. In 1991, the Association of European Cinematheques (ACE - Association des Cinémathèques Européennes) was established.

This article presents the demographic history of Romania through census results. See Demographics of Romania for a more detailed overview of the country's present-day demographics.
The 1930 census was the only one to cover Greater Romania. Censuses in 1948, 1956, 1966, 1977, 1992, 2002, and 2011 covered Romania's present-day territory, as does the current 2022 census.
All but the 1948 census, which asked about mother tongue, had a question on ethnicity. Moldavia and Wallachia each held a census in 1859. The Romanian Old Kingdom conducted statistical estimates in 1884, 1889, and 1894, and held censuses in 1899 and 1912. Ion Antonescu's regime also held two: a general one in April 1941, and one for those with "Jewish blood" in May, 1942.

Vertical and horizontal evacuation are strategies for providing safety to humans in case of tsunami, hurricane or other natural disaster.
Vertical evacuation
In areas where horizontal evacuation to higher ground is impossible, vertical evacuation to higher areas of a structure may be a way to shelter individuals from the surge of water, several meters high, that can follow an earthquake in coastal areas.
In the United States
The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency published design guidelines for vertical evacuation structures in 2008. According to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, serious discussions about vertical evacuation began in the United States following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The American Society of Civil Engineers adopted an updated edition of its building standards in September 2016, including tsunami hazards for the first time.
The first vertical evacuation site in the United States was Ocosta Elementary School, constructed in 2015–2016 on the Pacific Ocean coast in Westport, Washington, where a Cascadia subduction zone magnitude 9+ earthquake is expected to cause great tsunamis.
Horizontal evacuation
An alternative to vertical evacuation is horizontal evacuation, for instance a hurricane evacuation route. Critics of vertical evacuation planning have charged it with justifying even greater human density in areas prone to disaster, and prefer low density growth with horizontal evacuation planning.

Santa Rosa Creek is a 22-mile-long (35 km) stream in Sonoma County, California, which rises on Hood Mountain and discharges to the Laguna de Santa Rosa by way of the Santa Rosa Flood Control Channel. This article covers both the creek and the channel.
Description
Though it begins as a wild stream in the Mayacamas Mountains, Santa Rosa Creek is culverted for part of its course through the city of Santa Rosa's downtown. The riparian area has a rich prehistoric past with settlement of the Southern Pomo people on much of the middle and lower reach banks. A significant stream restoration project was created in the downtown Santa Rosa reach in the late 1990s, allowing steelhead and coho salmon to migrate to productive upstream spawning areas. Major tributaries to Santa Rosa Creek include Brush Creek, Piner Creek, Matanzas Creek and Colgan Creek. Annual precipitation in the Sonoma Creek watershed is about 24 to 38 inches (60 to 70 centimeters). Water quality sampling in the Railroad Square area of Santa Rosa indicate coliform bacteria standards are often exceeded.
History
Archaeological data demonstrates the habitation of Pomo tribes on the lower reaches of Santa Rosa Creek, while a branch of the Yuki tribe lived near the headwaters on the slopes of Hood Mountain. In the vicinity of the confluence of Brush Creek there is a noteworthy rock formation known as "Flat Rocks"; adjacent was a native Pomo village, presumably to exploit the resources of the confluence area as a suitable place for fishing, bathing, washing and providing drinking water. Near this location in the year 1828, Padre Juan Amorós, a Franciscan from Mission San Raphael, baptized a Pomo maiden on the feast day of Saint Rose of Lima; they named the woman "Rosa" and the location "Santa Rosa," establishing there a mission outpost (una asistencia). The "asistencia de Santa Rosa" became the center of the colonial settlement that would eventually become the town of Santa Rosa.
In the city of Santa Rosa, remains of the Carrillo Adobe attest to Spaniards as settlers in the middle reaches of Santa Rosa Creek. As the city of Santa Rosa developed more intensively, political pressure arose in the 1960s to channelize much of the creek in the core area of the city. This action led to a greatly reduced capability for anadromous fish to reach spawning areas upstream. Consequently, by the 1990s, planning began for a creek restoration project to tear out much of the channel concrete lining, provide re-vegetation and create a new low flow channel to accommodate steelhead and coho salmon spawning runs to the middle and upper reaches (i.e. above the downtown area of the city of Santa Rosa). As of July 2008, much of the renovation has been largely completed west of Santa Rosa Avenue, with the Prince Memorial Greenway extending along the creek west from Santa Rosa Avenue through downtown. This includes paved bicycle and pedestrian paths, creek access points, and substantial planting of vegetation. However, the portion between Santa Rosa Avenue and E Street is still contained within a covered culvert despite long-term plans to reopen the portion of it currently under city hall.
Geology
The headwaters of Santa Rosa Creek rise on the northern slopes of Hood Mountain, where the soils at the headwaters consist of soils of the Goulding cobbly clay loam association, which are well-drained gently to very steep loams and clay-loams situated upon upland formations. The lower elevations of the Hood Mountain headwaters consist of the Boomer soil association, which group has well-drained loams over a clay-loam subsoil. Considering the steepness of much of the terrain there is a remarkable lack of erosion, primarily because human access has been historically low, and vegetative cover has been kept intact.
As Santa Rosa Creek descends toward the valley floor Falta very gravelly loam is encountered, which has scrubby Valley Oak cover. On the gentle rolling slopes that join the valley are Haire series moderately well drained clay loam soils, which are used for dry-farm pasture and some vineyards. On the valley floor Santa Rosa Creek flows under State Route 12 and runs along Melita Road, thence somewhat more northerly and parallels the south side of Route 12. Over this middle reach the soils are typical of alluvial fans, consisting of Yolo silt loams and clay loams of less than two percent slope. Historically this soil has served pasture uses with some orchards. Currently most of this area is developed with medium density residential uses.
Below the downtown confluence with Matanzas Creek, which drains the northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain, can be considered the lower reach of this watershed. Most of the soils extending some distance from Santa Rosa Creek are Yolo sandy loam overwash. This zone is especially subject to flooding, and historically has served as pasture, orchard and vineyard. Erosion potential is slight due to the less than five percent slope of this reach.
Ecology
The upper reaches and headwaters of Santa Rosa Creek are on Hood Mountain on the western slopes of the southern Mayacamas Mountains. Much of the ecosystem of the headwaters is relatively dense mixed oak woodland, which has a canopy of coast live oak, Douglas fir, California buckeye (Aesculus californica) and bigleaf maple. In these oak woodlands, the dominant understory plants are toyon, blackberry, western poison-oak and in occasional drier patches some coyote brush. In some of the steeper, cooler riparian zones there are a high concentration of California bay laurel. Common animals observed include California mule deer, gray squirrel, raccoon, skunk, Western pond turtle, river otter and opossum. Less frequently tiger salamander, bobcat and mountain lion are seen. There is abundant birdlife including the scrub jay, Steller's jay, acorn woodpecker and junco.
As Santa Rosa Creek reaches the valley floor near Melita Road, the creek is choked with red willow, and also has coasted live oak, bigleaf maple, California laurel as well as a few Douglas fir and huckleberry oak, Quercus vacciniifolia. This middle reach of the creek has more of a suburban character compared to the wild headwaters area. The middle reach continues as a richly vegetated riparian zone from Melita Road westerly to Farmers Lane. The reach at the confluence of Brush Creek is particularly notable for the large boulder formation, known as "Flat Rocks". Below Farmers Lane the creek becomes channelized and much of the natural character is lost, until the creek begins to exit the west side of the city of Santa Rosa.

"Pop Life" is a song by Prince and the Revolution. It was the second US (and final UK) single from their 1985 album, Around the World in a Day, reaching number 7 in the US charts, becoming Prince's eighth top-ten hit in a two-year span.
Production
The song starts with a faded-in synth line and quickly starts the main tune. The easy groove is achieved with a smooth bass guitar and piano embellishments. A drum machine provides handclaps to make the song danceable. "Pop Life" was recorded before Purple Rain was completed, indicating the new direction Prince wanted to take after the success of that album and film. Lyrically, the song describes the tiresome and stressful side of the celebrity life, including the pressure that can lead to drug use ("What are you putting in your nose?/Is that where all your money goes?").
"Throw the bum out!"
The song includes a portion that features the sound of bell ringing for a boxing match, followed by the sound of a restless crowd with someone yelling "throw the bum out!" This was rumored to be taken from an actual concert in 1981 when Prince opened for the Rolling Stones in Los Angeles. Relatively unknown at the time, the crowd booed them off stage. They returned for the second show, getting a better reception, but with still some booing; Prince quit the tour shortly after. In reality, the bits are from a sound effects library; the same riot crowd sound effect can be heard in the 1982 horror film Alone in the Dark in the scene where a store is being looted (even the line "throw the bum out" can be heard at 35 minutes and 50 seconds into the movie). The reason for the sample's inclusion is unknown even to Prince himself; when asked about it on their online forum, Prince responded "Good ? - Me 2 :)" ("good question, me too :)").
Releases
The song was released in two extended versions. The UK 12" single version is a 9-minute extension of the tune, and ends with a similar synth sound as the beginning. The US received a "Fresh Dance Mix", which is a remix (by Sheila E.) that included some portions of the longer UK version. It clocks in at 6:16, and was included on the 2006 compilation album, Ultimate.
The US B-side of the track was "Hello", written quickly as a response to those who criticized Prince's lack of participation in the "We Are the World" event. The angry lyrics lambaste the prying media and false friendships, and is driven by a pulsing beat. The extended version of the song ends with a spoken word by Prince, which contain some self-humor about their high-heeled shoes. The UK B-side was "Girl", which the US had as the B-side of "America".
Elvis Costello once planned to do a cover version of the song, with altered lyrics, but Prince refused. Costello later recorded the song "The Bridge I Burned", which borrows the chord sequence from "Pop Life". Alternative rock band Local H recorded a cover of the song, but it has since gone unreleased.
Reception
Cash Box called it a "much more of a substantial offering — lyrically and musically — than [Prince's previous single] 'Raspberry Beret,'" saying that it "takes a look at the myths of the pop world and aspirations to that world."

WNYN-LD, virtual channel 39 (UHF digital channel 30), is a low-powered BeIN Sports Xtra-affiliated television station licensed to New York City, New York, United States. The station is owned by TVC Television, with its transmitter located atop the Citibank Building in Long Island City, Queens.
History
As W51BV
The station started out as W51BV channel 51 on July 19, 1991 as an affiliate of The Box Music Network licensed to Deer Park.
As WNYN-LP
On November 20, 1995, the station became WNYN-LP. In 2000, they ceased operations on channel 51 without warning, leaving many fans of The Box in the area in the dark. During this time, WNYN prepared to move to channel 39, while its sister station WXNY-LP, who at the time was on channel 39, prepared to move to channel 32.
One Sunday night in 2001, channel 51 came back on the air for one night with the LTV programming that also aired on WXNY-LP, but there was no audio. It is believed that this was WNYN's way of preventing their license from being revoked by the FCC for being silent for more than 12 consecutive months.
In 2002, WNYN-LP moved to channel 39 and became an affiliate of Azteca América, after the network earlier failed to acquire WSAH, which they intended to use as New York's Azteca América flagship.
As WNYN-LD
On June 12, 2009, analog transmission for full-powered stations ceased and digital transmission began. Azteca America moved to WMBC-TV (channel 63)'s sixth subchannel in 2010. WNYN concurrently switched to an independent station with a station logo which shows an overnight view of the New York City skyline with a new station branding called TVC 39. WNYN airs movies along with music videos plus general programming. WNYN is currently airing infomercials and is one of three affiliates that might join MundoFox in 2012, but it was picked up by WPXO-LD which has since ceased CaribeVision in 2012. Later that year they have found another affiliate which is TeLe-Romántica, thus replacing independent programming, which since the transition has been seen on 39.2 and 39.5 in both English and Spanish programming. As a result of the switch www.furiamusicaltv.com has since discontinued streaming programming. The website has since returned in 2013, airing infomercials in Spanish plus local programming.
Digital television
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
The station moved to channel 30, shared with WNJJ-LD, as the result of a channel sharing agreement implemented to resolve a displacement conflict in August 2019.

Emily Frances Valentine, designated the first lady of rugby and "female William Web Ellis" by the media, is the earliest documented female rugby player (at the age of 10) in 1887, and provides the only confirmed record of a woman playing in the nineteenth century. Prior to the discovery of Valentine, the earliest named female rugby player was Mary Eley in 1917, who at the age of sixteen played for the Cardiff Ladies.
Rugby
Valentine, born in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland circa 1878, was the youngest of six brothers and sisters. They played their first match of rugby union at the Portora Royal School, three years after their father William Valentine was named Assistant Headmaster. According to their memoirs, in the winter of 1887, they removed their hat and overcoat to play alongside their two brothers (William, aged 16, and John, aged 10 or 11) as their team was a man short. Valentine first kicked place, but then scored a try in their first game after moving to the wing alongside their brothers in the backline. Valentine would continue to participate with the team in practices and intra-school matches according to the school's records which also includes correspondence from Valentine in 1951.
Personal life
Valentine moved to South Africa in the late 19th century. They became a nurse and changed their name to Galway after marrying military doctor Major John Galeway OBE in 1909. Valentine moved to India until about 1915 (and possibly Canada) before settling in England.
One of Valentine's eight grandchildren is named Catherine Galway.

A fluxion is the instantaneous rate of change, or gradient, of a fluent (a time-varying quantity, or function) at a given point. Fluxions were introduced by Isaac Newton to describe their form of a time derivative (a derivative with respect to time). Newton introduced the concept in 1665 and detailed them in their mathematical treatise, Method of Fluxions. Fluxions and fluents made up Newton's early calculus.
History
Fluxions were central to the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy, when Newton sent a letter to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz explaining them, but concealing their words in code due to their suspicion. They wrote:
The gibberish string was in fact a hash code (by denoting the frequency of each letter) of the Latin phrase Data æqvatione qvotcvnqve flventes qvantitates involvente, flvxiones invenire: et vice versa, meaning: "Given an equation that consists of any number of flowing quantities, to find the fluxions: and vice versa".
Example
If the fluent is defined as (where is time) the fluxion (derivative) at is:
Here is an infinitely small amount of time. So, the term is second order infinite small term and according to Newton, we can now ignore because of its second order infinite smallness comparing to first order infinite smallness of . So, the final equation gets the form:
They justified the use of as a non-zero quantity by stating that fluxions were a consequence of movement by an object.
Criticism
Bishop George Berkeley, a prominent philosopher of the time, denounced Newton's fluxions in their essay The Analyst, published in 1734. Berkeley refused to believe that they were accurate because of the use of the infinitesimal . They did not believe it could be ignored and pointed out that if it was zero, the consequence would be division by zero. Berkeley referred to them as "ghosts of departed quantities", a statement which unnerved mathematicians of the time and led to the eventual disuse of infinitesimals in calculus.
Towards the end of their life Newton revised their interpretation of as infinitely small, preferring to define it as approaching zero, using a similar definition to the concept of limit. They believed this put fluxions back on safe ground. By this time, Leibniz's derivative (and their notation) had largely replaced Newton's fluxions and fluents, and remain in use today.
