Sasha “Scarlett” Hostyn was eliminated from Starcraft's World Championship Series' Challenger League on Jan. 24.
Although they displayed strong Swarmhost play and dominated Root Gaming's Max “Astrea” Angel in the late-game, Hostyn's efforts were undermined by catastrophic mistakes — like losing 12 Vipers in Game 3 — and questionable decision-making — such as their attempt to produce Swarmhosts off two bases after a hatch block in the ace match.
Because of this, they ended up dropping the series 3-2 in perhaps the greatest upset of the recent Challenger matches, marking the latest in a string of disappointing tournament results - a decline from a peak last year, following their victory at Red Bull Battle Grounds 2014 NA (RBBG NA) last July.
Once one of the best foreigners of all time, Hostyn's declining form has manifested itself in some surprising upsets. From the heights of RBBG NA, where they took three straight matches off two time WCS America Champion, Choi "Polt" Seong Hun, they have proceeded to drop maps and matches to supposedly inferior players.
I think wcs may be my last tournament — Scarlett (@AcerScarlett) January 6, 2015
On top of their dual losses to Angel in WCS Qualifiers and Challenger, Scarlett has been defeated by other relatively unknown foreigners, including Diego “Kelazhur” Schwimmer, a Brazilian Terran player on team Try Hard, and Michael “Moosegills” Wolff, an American Zerg on comPlexity Gaming's roster.
Hostyn's lack of tournament success has added to worries amongst their Starcraft fanbase concerning their growing interest in Dota 2.
In a post to their fan page, Hostyn recounted how their interest in Starcraft had waned sufficiently that their practice —and in turn their results— were suffering. As their commitment to Starcraft deteriorates, their interest in Dota 2 seems to be growing.
A Dota player since the game's first installment, Hostyn's steady transition to Dota 2 seems to be affirmed by their elimination from one of Starcraft's biggest tournaments. By now, a commitment to Dota 2, even a temporary one, seems all but certain.
With that being said, the longtime Acer member faces significant obstacles in their bid to break into the Dota 2 scene.
First and foremost is their own lofty goal of reaching a desired MMR rating of 6.5k that would put them among the top 20 Dota 2 players in North America, a remarkable feat for an essentially new player.
Hostyn themselves seems confident in their abilities to reach that goal.
6.5k mmr by end of feb or i go back to sc2 — Scarlett (@AcerScarlett) January 24, 2015
Referencing the fact that they achieved Grandmaster rank in their first season of Starcraft 2, Hostyn argued on teamliquid.net that their previous experience with Dota would help them to attain their goal. If nothing else, their high standards demonstrate their dedication to excellence.
Hostyn's second challenge may come from Dota 2 itself, a team-based multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game that differs significantly from a real-time strategy game like Starcraft 2.
While the veteran Zerg player may find success playing in the solo queue, it remains to be seen whether years of solitary play in Starcraft will put them at a disadvantage in a top-level team environment.
The move away from Starcraft comes at a chaotic time in the game's history.
With major new changes both to WCS format, including region locking and a combined EU and NA tournament, as well as the Legacy of the Void expansion on the horizon, Starcraft 2 is set to experience major changes in its competitive scene.
The professional player base has responded ambivalently as several well-known foreigners, including Kevin “qxc” Riley, have declared breaks from the game. Similarly, Lee “Jaedong” Jae Dong, the Brood War legend who made a successful transition to Starcraft 2 failed to appear in any of the three major qualifiers this season, though they have stated their intention to return for Season 2.
Meanwhile, the competitive scene was rocked by the triumphant return of Johan “Naniwa” Lucchesi, the former Alliance Protoss player from Sweden. Lucchesi, one of the most controversial figures in Starcraft history, exploded back onto the scene with a clean run through qualifiers and a 3-1 triumph over Hostyn's Acer colleague Artur "Nerchio" Bloch in Challenger to put the Swede back into Premier. With only a handful of Koreans left in the combined NA/EU WCS tournament, Lucchesi's return could not be better timed for success.
Lucchesi's dramatic departure from the scene in 2014 came just as Hostyn began the ascent to their peak. Now, if the “Queen of Blades” does in fact turn them back on the foreigner Starcraft scene, the “King in the North” seems poised to take up the mantle.
For now, it looks all but likely that the “Queen of Blades” will be looking for a new throne.

When Peter Fraser and Gordon Stevenson married in Sydney on June 27 last year, friends, family and dozens of strangers came to wish them well. But within minutes their marriage was over. Same Love Photography / Via samelove.com.au
Fraser, a dual British/Australian citizen, and Stevenson were the first same-sex couple to take advantage of Britain's recently enacted marriage equality laws by marrying in a British consulate. But the second they left the consulate and set foot back on Australian soil, their marriage was no longer recognised - under Australian law, it simply did not exist. A year later, the happy couple are still living together in legal limbo, married in the UK but living in sin in Australia. Fraser says married life has brought they and Gordon closer together after 20 years as a couple, but it's still disheartening to know they're not considered equal in Australia. "It still gives us that feeling of being a second class citizen. Although we are married in Britain, it doesn't really count here. It is upsetting to be treated differently, and actively discriminated against in the country where we live and pay taxes. It's got to end."
Since Fraser and Gordon married, 120 dual citizen couples have followed in their footsteps in consulates around Australia. Same Love Photography / Via samelove.com.au
In Melbourne, 43 couples have married while Sydney has seen 37 ceremonies. In Perth, 19 couples have tied the knot under the watchful eye of Queen Elizabeth and with a British flag as a backdrop. 12 same-sex couples have gotten hitched in Brisbane and 10 in Canberra. Tony Brenann is Britain's Deputy High Commissioner to Australia and has performed most of the ceremonies for same-sex couples that have been held in the High Commission in Canberra. They tell BuzzFeed News that the weddings are a nice change from the usual consulate business of helping British nationals in need, and a delight for consulate staff who get a chance to help make people smile. "It's quite fun. Each ceremony is different depending on the couple's wishes. Some of them have been quite small while some have been quite large and a very celebratory affair. But they're a nice thing to be a part of. They're happy occasions." For Brennan, the highlight has been marrying couples who are "quite senior in age." "It's wonderful that those people have found their partner at that stage of their lives," they say.
For Greg Turner and their partner Ryan, their wedding at the British High Commission in Canberra was about more than just a certificate. Australian Marriage Equality
The pair married in September 2014 after five years together and following a serious battle with cancer for Ryan. Greg tells BuzzFeed News that they felt throughout the treatment process that they aren't treated as a true life partner by medical staff. "We felt in the health system at that time that the recognition of our partnership was somewhat less honoured and properly considered than it should have been," they say. For Greg, the wedding was a recognition of a partnership that is just as valid as any heterosexual relationship. "It was glorious. It was in story book fashion, the best night of our lives. It allowed us to make a commitment we wanted to make."
Thanks to timezone differences, Douglas Pretsell and Peter Gloster became the first same-sex couple in the world to marry under Scottish law when they tied the knot in Melbourne. Via samelove.com.au
At one minute past midnight, Scottish time, On December 18 last year, the couple exchanged the civil partnership certificate they got in 2010 for a full marriage certificate. The difference between a civil partnership and a wedding certificate is immense. When applying for an Australian visa, Douglas was told not to produce their civil partnership certificate as part of their application. In fact, doing so could count against him. "People hang their prejudices off difference," Douglas says. "There was a perception that civil partnerships were lesser. My company wouldn't give me a day off for my civil partnership, which they did for people who got married." "I now know that on paper, at least in the UK, our marriage is equivalent to heterosexual marriages in the UK, which it wasn't previously."
When Sarah Midgely proposed to Shirleene Robinson in the New York Public Library, they could have chosen to get married in any of the four countries where they hold passports. They chose Australia, even though that decision posed the most difficulties. samelove.com.au
"The citizenship we share is Australian, but it's the one country where we can't get married," Robinson says. The pair married in front of 20 close family and friends at the British consulate in Sydney in September last year before holding a much bigger celebration the following day. A celebration which wasn't legally recognised in Australia. "It's definitely something we think about and it's quite a sad thing. We both love Australia, but to not have our relationship recognised as equal is a cause of sadness to us."
All of the couples who spoke to BuzzFeed News describe their consulate weddings as among the greatest days of their lives, but also say they were tinged with sadness. Same Love / Australian Marriage Equality
Samsung has had a rough couple of months. It seems like every time the Korean electronics giant is in the news it's because something is catching fire, getting hacked, or its chairperson is being arrested. The recent revelation that the CIA has hacked Samsung's smart TVs got the company on John Oliver's radar. Naturally, they roasted the company on the most recent Last Week Tonight.
The clip starts with a quick rundown of Samsung's recent problems with things catching fire. You, as a keen observer of Android news, are probably well aware of the Note7 fiasco. The fake Samsung ad starts about halfway through, voiced by Rob Corddry. Spoiler: things catch fire. There's also a lot of NSFW language.
Is Samsung ever going to put this exploding phone thing behind it? I don't know, but you can be sure we'll hear about every single Galaxy S8 that catches fire... even if someone literally throws it into a fire.
On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and took related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, by Executive Order 13400, the President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, and ordered the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the Darfur region. On October 13, 2006, by Executive Order 13412, the President took additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 and expanded in Executive Order 13400. In Executive Order 13412, the President also took steps to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).
On January 13, 2017, by Executive Order 13761, the President found that positive efforts by the Government of Sudan between July 2016 and January 2017 improved certain conditions that Executive Orders 13067 and 13412 were intended to address. Given these developments, and in order to encourage the Government of Sudan to sustain and enhance these efforts, section 1 of Executive Order 13761 provided that sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 and the entirety of Executive Order 13412 would be revoked as of July 12, 2017, provided that the criteria in section 12(b) of Executive Order 13761 had been met.
On July 11, 2017, by Executive Order 13804, I amended Executive Order 13761, extending until October 12, 2017, the effective date in section 1 of Executive Order 13761.
Despite recent positive developments, the crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997; the expansion of that emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006; and with respect to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July 11, 2017, has not been resolved. These actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I have, therefore, determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, as expanded by Executive Order 13400, with respect to Sudan.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

In Miami, successfully assembling an “orange”
We're building the iconic Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science in Miami. The planetarium is in the foreground.
Our team at Miami's Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science project just assembled 32 concave orange peel-like pieces – weighing about 50,000 pounds per panel – to form a full dome planetarium. The operation required 24-hour-a-day/seven-day-a-week work over two-and-a-half weeks to precisely place and connect the segments.
Our team had been planning this unusual operation since we joined this project in May. The operation began with erecting a massive, 50-foot-tall center shoring tower and setting a precast dome cap, which was 100 percent welded off before any of the “orange-peel” segments could be rigged and lifted into place. The shoring tower was necessary as the segments couldn't support themselves until all 32 of them were in position, welded and inspected.
To maneuver the pieces, we brought in a specialized 550-ton hydraulic crane with a superlift.
Once the center pieces were in place, our team installed the orange-peel perimeter segments opposite one another in a counter-clockwise rotation to avoid lateral load on the dome cap. To maneuver the pieces, we brought in a specialized 550-ton hydraulic crane with a superlift. This sequence required erecting the panels during the day and welding the panels at night to be ready to erect new panels in morning and maintain schedule.
The team erected panels during the day and welded the panels at night so they could be ready to erect new panels in morning and maintain schedule.
Our team paid close attention to safety during this critical and not-so-traditional precast operation. The shoring tower was an engineered system that was inspected daily before work could commence, as it served double duty as a working platform and shoring tower. The planetarium was barricaded off at all times to only allow specially trained and authorized personnel to enter. The welders were working from both an OSHA-approved guard rail system located within the working platform system, along with strategically placed spider lifts. All personnel were certified riggers, flagmen and welders. This day and night operation had no safety incidents.
At the end of last year, our Frost Museum team successfully executed one of the world's most unusual concrete pours: creating a martini glass-shaped 500,000-gallon seawater aquarium tank through a non-stop 25-hour, 1,200-cubic-yard placement.

FBI Director James Comey and NSA chief Mike Rogers are not expected to appear Tuesday at a closed hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, Fox News confirmed.
Tuesday's appearance would have followed up on the pair's open testimony last week on the topic of Russian meddling in the presidential election and the alleged mishandling of intelligence related to the Trump transition team.
"Director Comey and Adm. Rogers could not come in tomorrow as we'd hoped, so the Committee will continue to try to schedule a time when both of them can meet with us in closed session," a spokesperson for Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said in an email to Fox News.
Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and ex-CIA Director John Brennan were originally scheduled to appear during an open hearing Monday. However, Nunes canceled those appearances because they wanted to hear in private from Comey and Rogers after Nunes revealed last week they had seen incidental intercepts of Trump team communications. Nunes said they had seen other members of Trump's team "unmasked" and their identities widely disseminated throughout the government. Other members of the Intelligence Committee had yet to see the documents shown to Nunes.
Comey and Rogers still could come at a later date.
There will now be no hearing on Tuesday, though Nunes' office noted that didn't mean the hearing was canceled -- because it had never officially been scheduled.
"We tried to get it organized for tomorrow, but it didn't work out," a spokesperson said.
Story highlights Senate Democrats hope McConnell will "cut through the clutter" of GOP positions
No agreements, but senators of both parties offer positive words
The President "rejected" House GOP proposal, Republican lawmaker says
House Republicans have been sidelined
Congressional negotiators had no agreements to report Saturday, but they issued positive reports on their talks to end a partial government shutdown and avert a default on government debt.
"Cordial" was the word Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, used to describe their "preliminary" discussions with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
"Good" discussions were going on among Senate leaders, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, "so I think all of us want to support those efforts, and hopefully they bear fruit over the weekend."
For all the positive talk, the only actions Saturday fell into the "no" category:
--Republican leaders said President Barack Obama rejected their proposal for a six-week debt limit extension.
--The Senate defeated a procedural measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached.
--Reid said a proposal by a bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, is no longer on the table because it treated opening the government as a "concession."
Reid continues to demand that any plan include a "clean" bill with no strings attached that raises the debt limit and reopens the government.
Countdown to default
The Treasury Department says it will be unable to pay the government's bills unless the debt limit is increased by Thursday. The partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since October 1.
Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world. They spoke to CNN's Richard Quest at an Institute of International Finance conference in Washington.
"You know, I've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world. I wouldn't say they are confident. I would say they are concerned, and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved, because they know it's going to impact on their economy," Lagarde said.
Senate Democrats meet with president
Senate Democrats met with Obama for 75 minutes Saturday afternoon. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party is unified.
"Democrats are willing to negotiate on anything Republicans want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills," said the aide.
Another Democratic source said party leaders regard Republicans as lacking a coherent position. They hope McConnell can "cut through the clutter," the source told CNN's Dana Bash.
The sources, who are familiar with the talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly.
Despite the lack of agreement, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said progress was being made.
"I think our Republican colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that Obamacare is not a major part of the discussion any more among most all Senate and many House Republicans," they said.
No votes on Sunday
Before the White House meeting, the Senate's second highest-ranking Democrat, Richard Durbin of Illinois, told CNN's Deirdre Walsh that Democrats hoped to reach agreement with Republican negotiators before stock markets open Monday.
Even if that optimistic timetable could be met, a deal could not be voted upon Sunday.
The Senate is scheduled to come back into session at 1 p.m. ET Sunday, but no votes are planned and Senators have been told their presence is not required. The House is not scheduled to meet until Monday afternoon.
Even as they demanded a "clean" bill, Reid said it was encouraging that McConnell had approached them to start their weekend talks.
"I hope that our talking is some solace to the American people and the world," Reid said. They said McConnell had approached him. "This hasn't happened until now," Reid said.
Obama-Boehner talks stall
Republican leadership told the Republican caucus during a Saturday morning meeting that the president will not accept their proposal to raise the debt limit for six weeks.
Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told CNN Saturday that "the President rejected our deal."
The standstill came after a Friday afternoon phone call between Boehner and Obama in which they decided to keep talking.
Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Illinois, said the President is waiting for a better offer.
"It doesn't seem like the White House is serious at all about entering negotiations with us until they see what comes out of the Senate. If they get something out of the Senate that's weaker than our negotiated position, it obviously strengthens their position," Kinzinger said.
While Democrats flat out rejected Boehner's proposal, even some Republicans didn't like it. That's because it lacked a mechanism in the House proposal to immediately reopen the government, which has been partially shut down since October 1, prompting the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, the closing of national parks and an increase in public anger.
Last month, popular gaming peripheral and gadget company Razer quietly scooped up a significant portion of Ouya, the company behind the Kickstarted $99 Android console. Today, Razer is explaining why and what that means to both its fans and Ouya owners.
Razer's June 12 purchase only included the content catalog, software assets, online store and name of Ouya; it didn't include the now-dated console or poorly received controller. Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan tells Polygon that the purchase was fueled by Razer's long-term plans for Android TV and its own Android-based console, Forge TV. The purchase floods Razer's device with about 1,500 games optimized for Android TV, but also allows Razer to introduce those games to other Android TV platforms, specifically those in China's lucrative, yet mostly untapped Android marketplace. "Android TV was already something we were interested in, or rather Android gaming in the living room," Tan said. "It's something we've been hyper focused on. When this opportunity came about to bring the entire suite of content from Ouya to Android TV it seemed like a phenomenal opportunity." Alibaba's Tmall Box Where Ouya's games were locked to the system, Tan has plans to greatly expand their availability. "We're going to amp it up," they said, "open all Ouya games to Google Play and the boxes in China." While some Ouya games are already available in China through the Xiaomi Mi Box and Alibaba's Tmall Box, Tan said that with Razer's broad connections in China the company will be able to greatly expand the reach of developers publishing games through Ouya. They also plan to open all of Ouya's games to both the Mi Box and Tmall Box. The Ouya store will eventually be relaunched as Cortex for Android TV, a online store for Razer Forge TV games and other content, they said. The company will also publish Android TV content and Android-based TV console games under the Ouya name. Razer's interest in creating an Android TV console was announced in June 2014 and the Razer Forge TV unveiled in January. The console currently sells for $99.99, or $149.99 with a controller. The console currently gets its content from the Google Play Store. Tan said the focus for Forge TV and the Ouya purchase wasn't as much about expanding Razer's footprint in China (Tan says they already have a massive business in that market), but rather allowing developers to reach a much broader audience with their games. From Ouya to Forge Tan is making sure that Ouya's current supports, the people who own the microconsole, aren't left out in the cold — at least not immediately. "If you already own the hardware, we're going to be keeping the lights on for at least a year," they said. "And we're going to be working to transition those people to Forge TV." The plan, which will be better detailed in the future, will include offering "deep discounts," freebies and giveaways for Ouya owners who want to purchase a Forge TV, and for Razer to allow Ouya users to bring their games, controllers and accounts to the new system. The purchase of Ouya is just the latest sign, Tan said, of how committed Razer is to Android TV gaming.
While the company promises to continue development of the Forge TV, Tan said the current iteration will likely be in place for awhile. The company is also still working on two promised additions to Forge TV: the Turret living room gaming mouse and lapboard and the ability to stream PC games to your television through Forge TV. "We're still working on streaming," they said." We still think it will hit by the [end of the year]." The Turret, they added, is meant to launch alongside that service. Devs, devs, devs, devs, devs Matt Gilgenbach, whose game Neverending Nightmares launched simultaneously on the Ouya and PC, sees the acquisition as a good thing for gamers and developers. "Ouya is an amazing platform and everyone working there is super passionate and dedicated to seeing indie games thrive," they said. "The one weakness is the hardware. The original Ouya hardware wasn't ideal, and the hardware is really dated now. By joining forces with Razer, a company known for their quality hardware, they can create an outstanding microconsole and platform." While Devastated Dreams, Gilgenbach's next game, wasn't planned for an Ouya release, that could now change. "The original Ouya hardware wasn't ideal." "Our current game Devastated Dreams (which is on Kickstarter now) is PC exclusive because the improved graphics couldn't run on the original Ouya," they said. "Razer's Android hardware is technically impressive, so we will definitely investigate bringing Devastated Dreams and future projects to it." The developers at Cowboy Color, currently working on ChargeShot, seem most excited about the opportunity to target a Chinese audience. "Ouya had a great idea going for it." "Ouya had a great idea going for it, before the acquisition, that was a little bit ahead of its time, and perhaps misunderstood," the studio team said. "All of a sudden, there was a home console that new developers could, almost at the press of a button, release games on. As marketplaces like Steam and mobile become more saturated, I've watched developers move to less popular, less saturated platforms (the Wii U especially, as of late) in order to make their games known. Android consoles and TVs seem to be picking up as of late which opens an entire new market of people playing video games, and if Razer pushes forward with OUYA's agenda of targeting Chinese audiences, it opens a bridge to an untapped audience as well. "It is very exciting for once to speculate not what people already like, but what they are about to like." Ouya team joins Razer Along with the acquisition of the software, store and name, Razer is also bringing on a number of the core people at Ouya responsible for developer outreach, Tan said. About 15 Ouya employees will be working at Razer under this new deal. Among those employees is Ouya's head of developer relations, and former president of thatgamecompany, Kellee Santiago. One of the jobs that team is currently focusing on is ensuring that there is a smooth transition for developers both in terms of technology and contracts. "We've always had a great relationship with indies," Tan said.
Canada's first Cheesecake Factory is officially open for business as of 11:30 a.m. this morning, and it looks like a solid 99 per cent of GTA residents have shown up to celebrate the occasion.
Kidding. Yorkdale is big, but not big enough to hold a 6 million seat restaurants even if it looks like there are that many people waiting in line right now.

Someone on Twitter said that they saw someone sell their spot in line for the first sitting at Yorkdale's Cheesecake Factory for $300 (and an OVO lanyard, which might mean he's joking.)
"Apparently there are 3 sets of lineups," wrote another hopeful diner. "There's about 100 ppl in our line. We're lineup number 2. Get here quick!"

We've been unable to reach the Cheesecake Factory at Yorkdale by phone to find out how long the wait time is (their lines are busy, as are their staff I bet.)
In the meantime, those interested in flossing their affinity for chain restaurants on Instagram can go stand in front of the store for pictures.
CLEVELAND — Get ready for the Trump dynasty.
Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of Donald Trump and a top campaign surrogate, is focusing on their career now — but they may run for elected office in the future.
“Maybe when the kids get out of school, I would consider it,” Trump Jr. said at a breakfast on Wednesday sponsored by the Wall Street Journal.
Some enthusiastic fans are urging them not to wait.
“How about Donald Trump, Jr. running for Mayor of New York City? I believe they can coalesce support & get De Blasio out of there,” tweeted Gene White, managing partner at Dewey Stone Group LLC.
Focus group guru Frank Luntz polled 18 participants during Junior's convention speech last night and 15 wanted them in political office.
“He was so good, they felt their father should take lessons from him. They felt they humanized their father,” Luntz told The Post.
“I've been doing this since 1992, I've never seen a kid do so well. Reagan's kids were not nearly as good.”
“A star is born,” said former GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. “He rocked the house!”
“He's more articulate than their dad — no doubt about it. He's made a name for themselves in business and politics.”
Trump Jr., the father of five, delivered Tuesday night's best-received speech at the Republican National Convention, earning rave reviews even from critics of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
Trump Jr., 38, seemed to relish the praise, saying the “impossible” happened Tuesday night after their speech: Talking heads on MSNBC praised him.
“It's certainly been exciting,” they said of their father's campaign.
“Right now, obviously the focus is to help my father and do what I possibly can to make a difference, and just being a small cog in the wheel has been incredible.”
The Isla Vista community has been gearing up for the start of UCSB's fall quarter on September 22, and students will find a few changes. Each of these changes has the potential to make the area a little nicer, safer, and more pleasant. First and foremost, a new Sheriff's Department lieutenant now heads the Isla Vista Foot Patrol. Lt. Robert Plastino took over for Lt. Ray Vuillemainroy, who moved to overseeing the Santa Maria Substation.
Plastino is a San Diego native who is well-versed in the unique challenges Isla Vista poses. They worked as a Foot Patrol officer more than 10 years ago before moving on to become head of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's human resources department. They also served in Iraq and is a decorated war veteran. Their previous experiences make them the perfect candidate for this post. They know how to deal with chaos and still find ways to address individual needs. So far, they said, their new job has kept them incredibly busy.
In the past two weeks I have met with Plastino twice to discuss issues of particular interest to local residents. We talked about noise, trash, and Halloween. In each of these discussions they showed themselves to be intelligent, focused on community improvement, and most importantly, in possession of a good sense of humor.

Anyone working or living in I.V. has to have a sense of humor. Isla Vista is a very different place where rules, like stopping your bike at stop signs, are often flouted, and some students believe that anything goes. Things that would not be tolerated in other areas, like Montecito, are accepted as part of the I.V. culture. But the lieutenant does not accept this as a given. They said things have changed for the better in I.V. since they worked here 10 years ago, and they want to keep up the forward progress.
Plastino already has a long list of tasks that they would like to spearhead. As they meet residents, they listen to their concerns in order to see where law enforcement efforts can become more effective.  They are working with UCSB and SBCC officials to enhance accountability for students in Isla Vista and is discussing ways to use the property owned by Santa Barbara County in downtown I.V., that formerly housed the Isla Vista Neighborhood Clinic, as a possible community meeting space.
Lights and More Lights
Since safety remains of the utmost concern, Plastino was particularly enthusiastic about the addition of energy-efficient LED lighting along Del Playa Drive, Sabado Tarde, Trigo, and Pasado roads. Last year, members of Associated Students UCSB were instrumental in highlighting the safety concerns posed by inadequate lighting in Isla Vista, and Santa Barbara County allocated the funds through a Community Block Grant to make improvements. This was just the first phase in a long-term plan to address lighting issues.
Locals will also notice that the median along El Colegio, near Isla Vista elementary school, has been revamped. New landscaping and lovely street lights have been added.
With a new school year beginning, and renewed efforts to beautify and improve Isla Vista, there are reasons to be optimistic. Each time someone makes a small effort to improve the I.V. environment, we all benefit.
Below are extracts from my conversation with Lt. Plastino.
When did you take over command of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol?
I was officially assigned to Isla Vista on July 8. Prior to that transfer, I was the lieutenant of the Human Resources Bureau for the Sheriff's department, where I spent the past four years. Before that, I was a sergeant for the Central Stations patrol, which includes the Santa Ynez, Solvang, Buellton, and Lompoc areas.
Tell me about your background.
I grew up in Solana Beach, a small coastal town in San Diego County. After high school, my parents moved the family to Nipomo. I attended San Diego State University and obtained a B.S. in Business Management. I later obtained a master's from Cal State Northridge in Public Administration. But in between, I worked in the private sector, first for a company in Orange, and then later for a company in Irvine. I had this desire to do something more and to serve the community. So while maintaining my job, I joined the Army National Guard as military police. I ended up enjoying my experience as an MP so much that I decided to switch careers and make law enforcement my main profession. I moved back to the Central Coast in 1997 and was hired by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.
I was first assigned as a deputy to Isla Vista in 1998 and again in 2004. Each time, I spent close to two years in Isla Vista, doing foot and bike patrols. I've also worked various other assignments in the department, including gangs, DARE, background investigations, narcotics, SWAT, and I'm currently the supervisor for the Sheriff's Underwater Search and Recovery Unit (dive team).
I was deployed numerous times with my military unit. Once, during the Bosnian war and then twice after 9/11. My wife and I were married just days before I deployed for Iraq in 2003. After I returned home, we wanted to start a family, so I left my part-time military career in 2005. I now have a 7-year old son and twin daughters, one and a half years old.
I love living in Santa Barbara County and working here. I feel privileged that I can raise my family in such a beautiful location.
What are some of the improvements you are trying to bring about?
The first things that come to mind are safety, quality of life, and social responsibility. I don't think we can ever reach a point where we say that safety concerns have been completely eliminated; improving the safety of residents and visitors to Isla Vista is at the top of my list. There are methods to make this happen, but it requires involvement from the community as well as law enforcement. Resources from the Sheriff's Department are not unlimited, so we have to get creative in our solutions. This involves buy-in from the community, so we turn to community leaders for assistance. I personally rely on partnerships with Supervisor Doreen Farr, the University Police Department, and other UCSB departments such as the Dean of Students Office, the Associated Students, Women's Center, and Office of Student Life. Additionally, I provide and obtain input from the Isla Vista Community Network, business owners, the California Highway Patrol, permanent I.V. residents, and many other area stakeholders. Improving safety is the job of the entire community.
Getting the word out and creating that shift in thinking is critical, and it is a challenge at times. However, even simple efforts such as the “Stop Burglaries in I.V.” campaign, which reminds residents to lock their doors and windows, make a difference.
Quality of life improvements are more subjective and less quantifiable than pulling crime statistics. This involves practices regarding safety, but it also requires proper infrastructure to make Isla Vista a desirable location and one that can cater to its diverse population. We have families, retirees, students, professors, businesses, homeless, and a myriad of other residents and visitors that provide for an incredible array of culture and ethnic diversity.
Improving the lives of individuals from such varied backgrounds is a humbling and daunting task. Again, I cannot make these types of improvements alone. I have worked with the Isla Vista Recreation and Parks Department to come up with solutions in regards to the district parks. I have also urged the building of the Pescadero Lofts project, which will provide low-income housing and onsite medical and mental services for our homeless population so they can begin the process of recovery and rehabilitation. For students, I have worked with the Associated Students at UCSB to provide education to the student body about our laws and regulations, as well as methods to keep themselves and their neighbors safe. Additionally, I've met with property owners to discuss ways that they can provide living situations that benefit them and their renters in positive ways. This includes coming up with ideas for lease agreements that assist law enforcement in shutting down parties with too many occupants, or fining tenants that contribute to underage drinking.
Compared to the previous years I was assigned to Isla Vista, I've seen a phenomenal change in student attitudes toward their own social responsibilities within the community. This is such a refreshing and encouraging transformation from previous years, where it seemed very few people showed an interest in making positive social changes in the community. Cultivating this new mentality is something I embrace and want to see continue. I was recently approached by a UCSB Bike Club student who noticed the large number of derelict bikes scattered throughout Isla Vista. They had a desire to refurbish abandoned bikes that the Sheriff's Department would normally confiscate and destroy if the owner could not be located. They were willing to fix these bikes with club money and then give them away to needy students and Isla Vista residents. Working with him, we have started a program that is socially responsible, helps clean up the community, and provides a benefit to those that are in need. This is the kind of effort that I strive to cultivate and improve among the population.
How are you working with officials at SBCC to improve collaboration?
On Friday evening, September 20, SBCC President Lori Gaskin came out to Isla Vista to see how we provide safety to their students and to get an idea of how their students are impacting the town. They were very engaged with the students on the street, some of whom immediately recognized them and approached them in a positive way. They also witnessed some of their students receiving citations for various alcohol-related crimes.
As we walked up and down the increasingly busy streets of Del Playa, Sabado Tarde, and the business loop, we talked about the difficulties of educating new students about our laws and regulations. Each year, we get a fresh group of new students that don't know how to keep themselves safe in such a dense population, or what the impacts of their actions might have on their future. Early in the evening, one SBCC student was cited for being a minor in possession of alcohol, and it was their second offense in two weeks. They understood that they were going to lose their driver's license for a year because of the second citation. The lesson learned was that maybe better education, up front, for incoming students is needed to help them make wiser decisions.
Of course, there will still be plenty of young adults that do not take sage advice and are destined to either learn from their own mistakes or end up paying the consequences in court. Both President Gaskin and I agreed that collaborative efforts between SBCC and Isla Vista Foot Patrol could help alleviate some of these problems. Over the next few months, I will be working with them to improve our combined interest in educating students of their responsibilities and then holding them responsible for their actions. It's a small percentage of students that end up making bad choices, but we will be working together to make that percentage an even smaller figure.

Propaganda is a derogatory term referring to information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, that is used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.
Hail to the Chief, anyone?
As I watched President Barack Obama's press conference in Paris, I found myself thinking back on an undergraduate marketing class I took many (many) moons ago; when the phrase “glittering generalities” floated into my awareness, I realized why!
AP photo
President Obama was using the same classic propaganda techniques advertisers use to manipulate buying behavior. President Obama was trying to manipulate our buying behavior—only they were selling an ideology not a product. And, man, was they working their ABC – Always Be Closing!
A quick recap of the seven propaganda techniques used by advertisers: glittering generalities; name calling; testimonial; plain folks; bandwagon; transfer; and card-stacking. I have taken the liberty of rephrasing them as befits the hawking of a political ideology.
Glittering Generalities: Nice words to represent the ideology, like goodness or patriotism.
During their press conference, Mr. Obama referred to “human ingenuity” as the triumphant, all-conquering weapon against climate change. So rigid is their ideology that they caught and corrected themselves when they referred to it initially as “American ingenuity.” The most shining of our American characteristics, more American than apple pie, was thus dimmed and diluted across a global community of “other smart folks.”
Name Calling: Trash-talking anyone not in lockstep with the ideology for sale.
The American two-party political system is a give-and-take process of persuasion, negotiation, and compromise. Rather than acknowledging Republicans as worthy Americans with a different ideology, Mr. Obama reduced their challenges to their agenda as “a matter of the games Washington plays.”
.
Testimonial: A famous person endorses the ideology.
Mr. Obama made sure to let us know that “Bill” (as in Gates) was on board with inventing new technologies to combat climate change. In the president's irksome—and to my mind, affected—way of talking to us like we're their BFFs, they joked that Microsoft knew “a little somethin'” about inventing new technologies.
Plain Folks: Appeals to “the folks” that invoke our values.
Reaching out to help others is a core American value, and President Obama well knows it. Their call to address the perils of climate change sooner than at once stoked our sense of responsibility and compassion; we must live our lives today “without condemning the next generation to a planet that is beyond its capacity to repair.”
Bandwagon: An appeal to be part of the group.
This is where President Obama artlessly bludgeoned us with the “everyone is doing it” of global consensus on climate change. We were enticed to join “not just the 99.5 percent of scientists and experts but the 99 percent of world leaders” who think climate change “is really important.” Of course “really important” is code for “Would you look at those knuckle-draggers who think climate change might be a natural cycle! The idiots actually think a warmer environment can confer some advantage!” (Yes, we would answer. See quadrupling of Caribou population after the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline was built.)
Transfer: An appeal that helps us see ourselves as part of the bright, shining progressive ideology on a hill.
“I'm optimistic,” they said. “I think we're gonna (BFFs again) solve [the problem of climate change].”
In a fleeting acknowledgement that Islamic State might also be “really important,” President Obama opined that “In some ways, [climate change] is akin to the problem of terrorism and ISIL. In the immediate aftermath of a terrible attack like happened here in Paris, sometimes it's natural for people to despair. But … look at Paris! You can't tear down Paris because of the demented actions of a handful of individuals. The beauty, the joy, the life, the culture, the people, the diversity … that's gonna win out every time.”
Card-stacking: Manipulating information to make the ideology appear better than it is, often by unfair comparison or omitting facts.
Let me count the ways.
Our president compared the vanquishing of eternal doom for our planet, AKA climate change, to the vanquishing of Ebola.
“We went, what, a month, a month and a half where people were pretty sure Ebola was gonna kill us all. Nobody asks me about it anymore.”
As Mr. Obama clearly demonstrated, if we can stem the outbreak of a potentially lethal virus across a few countries, we can most certainly control the temperature of—and China's carbon emissions into—our atmosphere.
And my favorite move of all, President Obama invoked the beauty of capitalism and the power of markets to incentivize a cleaner environment. They then erroneously stated that “the market doesn't price clean air or clean water on its own” as the rationale for government manipulation of energy production. (Someone might want to tell Costco there's no market for the pallets and pallets and pallets of “clean” bottled water they sell.)
Finally and not unique to advertising propaganda, there's plain old stupidity or lying, take your pick. When our commander in chief said our U.S.-style brand of mass shooting “just doesn't happen in other countries,” they were standing a relatively short distance away, as the crow flies, from two now infamous public locations where innocent civilians were gunned down like dogs in the street. I'm not sure I see the nuance of difference between our mass shootings and theirs.
President Obama's Superbowl commercial … I mean press conference behind him, they have moved on to the next stop on their ideological tour—the aptly titled “I trust the wisdom of the American people to replace me with a Democrat in 2016.”
Left behind in their wake, we the consumer choose to buy what he's selling or not. As for me and my house, I think we'll pass.

TheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views. The opinions expressed in this channel are solely those of each individual author.
Brandon Marshall is a player who comes with a lot of baggage. In March of 2012, shortly after the Bears acquired the then 27-year-old receiver, the Chicago Tribune published an article outlining every time Marshall had been involved in some sort of problematic incident off the field.
It is not a short list.
It includes, amongst other things, two arrests for suspicion of domestic violence, an alleged purse snatching, getting into an argument with their father in a parking lot over allegedly firing a gun, stealing sheets from a Burlington Coat Factory, and one incident in which Marshall had to be taken to hospital after their wife stabbed them in the abdomen… because, as they later admitted, they had tried to trap them in a closet.
So it's understandably hard to conflate that Marshall with the Marshall who just this past week was talking to the NFL Thursday Night Football crew after the Bears' victory over the Giants. Upon being asked about their feelings regarding Bears QB Jay Cutler, the man with a history of antagonizing their loved ones was replaced by one who was bursting with affection.
"This year man, it's like night and day, he's unbelievable," they said. "I mean, I'm lost for words when I talk about him." Marshall went on to talk about how well-read Cutler was, and how impressed they were with Cutler's quest for self-improvement as a father and a husband. When asked if any of Cutler's improved performance could be attributed to new head coach Marc Trestman, Marshall said, "You know, honestly, it's more credit to Cutler." They later added that Cutler is "probably the smartest man in any room."
If this seems like a suspiciously hyperbolic assessment of Cutler (a player so famous for their bored and stupid expressions that they spawned a meme wherein cigarettes are photoshopped lazily dangling from the corner their mouth), that's because it probably is. Marshall suffers from a mental illness called Borderline Personality Disorder, a disease that, amongst other things, causes you to see everyone you know as either your best friend or your greatest enemy, and your mind determines which of two they are based only on the last thing they did or said. Marshall had a great game, in large part due to Cutler. It's unsurprising that in this moment, Cutler is Marshall's very best friend in the world.
Ukraine's Kazakh Embassy has lodged a protest over maps near an international energy exposition in Astana that show Ukraine's occupied Crimean Peninsula as part of Russia.
The maps are part of decorative statues on Nurzhol Boulevard outside of Expo 2017, a three-month exposition that began on June 10 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in attendance.
One statue is holding a map of Ukraine that does not include the territory of Crimea. Another holds a map of Russia that includes Crimea.
The Ukrainian Embassy wrote on Facebook on June 12 that the map of Ukraine was shown "with elements in violation of the country's territorial integrity," and the map of Russia was shown "with elements that violate Ukraine's territorial integrity."
The Ukrainian Embassy said it expected explanations from Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry.
Russia seized control of Crimea in 2014 after sending in troops and staging a referendum considered illegitimate by Ukraine and more than 100 other countries in the United Nations.
There's no better feeling than getting down and groovy with some live music in the summer time. Whether you're a long time dead head, a Phish fanatic or just getting into the jam band music scene, Twiddle is up and coming on the front and center of the feel-good funk of the music scene. If you haven't heard them yet, it's time to put on some headphones and get ready to rock.
The band was formed in 2004 in Vermont by two normal dudes who just wanted to make some music. Original members Mihali Savoulidis and Ryan Dempsey met at Castleton State College, later picking up Brook Jordan, who was a grade younger, and finally Zdenek Gubb taking to place of the bands first bassist in 2007. Savoulidis is lead vocalist and guitarist, while we have Dempsey on vocals, keyboard, organ and synth, Jordan on vocals and drums, and finally Gubb on vocals and bass.
Each player brings a special something to the table, resulting in a stage covered in a rhythmic spice and tangy tones. They incorporate aspects of rock, jazz, bluegrass, funk and reggae into their music, while also digging into the depths of their own original flow.
Savoulidis is known for their shredding guitar style and the energy they bring to the stage, allowing for a real connection between band and audience. On the keys, Dempsey is said to show influence of the famous Herbie Hancock, but also finds it in their own style to express a light forest fairy feel as their fingers flood across the keys. Jordan magically holds the whole group together by creating just the right bounce or breakdown in verses, solos and transitory periods throughout the music, while Gubb's unstoppable bassist force and stage presence blends right into the group like butter on bread.
The band's newest album, PLUMP: Chapter Two, that recently came out in late April of 2017, is already a great success. Some of the groups other top songs include, “When It Rains It Pours,” “Jamflowman,” “Daydream Farmer,” and a personal favorite, “Beethoven and Greene”.
The group will be making a small tour this summer, starting out in Scranton, Pennsylvania, beginning this Thursday July 13th, and continuing through New York, Vermont, Colorado and Connecticut. So if you're in the area, stop by and show them some love! I guarantee they'll give some back in return.
Wed 06 July 2016 In Essays.
We all know about the incredible progress that deep learning has made in recent years. In just 5 years, we went from near-unusable speech recognition and image recognition, to near-human accuracy. We went from machines that couldn't beat a serious Go player, to beating a world champion. We went further than anybody could have foreseen --if you went back to 2010 and told AI researchers about the things we can do today, most likely no one would believe you. And we keep on making remarkable progress on a month-to-month basis.
Deep learning research has been moving forward amazingly fast, but here's the thing: so far very little of this progress has made its way into the products and processes that make up our world. Most of our research findings are not yet applied. Large tech companies talk about AI a lot, yet there is still relatively little AI in your phone, or in your computer. You typically don't use AI technologies yourself in your day-to-day life, at home or at work. Certainly, you can ask simple questions to your smartphone and get coherent answers. You can get fairly useful product recommendations on Amazon. You can search for "birthday" on Google Photos and instantly find those pictures of your daughter's birthday party from last month. That's a far cry from where such technologies used to stand. But these applications are still just accessory --AI is not yet fundamental to the way you interact with your computer, or to the way society is organized. In fact, it's barely present.
Right now it may seem hard to believe that AI and deep learning are about to change our world, because at this point they are not yet widely deployed. They are still very much under development, and they have yet to have any significant impact. We are still just starting to figure out what the "killer apps" for deep learning might be.
But it will happen. Maybe not right away, though. There is a lot of hype around deep learning right now, and people sometimes have unrealistic short-term expectations. AI will take time to get deployed to its true potential, but when it does, it will have a long-term social and economic impact that most people seem to underestimate. It will transform medicine, transportation, scientific research, communication, and even culture. AI will be our interface to the world --a world that will increasingly be woven out of information.
To anchor this a bit, I find it useful to look back at a previous wave of world-changing technology: the Internet.
In 1995, the Internet had had little impact on society. If you went around telling people that the Internet was about to change the world, you would have been with met a lot of skepticism. Most people didn't see how this new thing was relevant to them, and they didn't think that "normal" people would ever find value in the Internet. It's the same today with AI. But things are about to change, on an even larger scale.
Think about it this way: when the Internet became mainstream, a lot of business models were disrupted and a lot of companies had to transform themselves or disappear, such as bookstores, retailers, DVD sellers. And the same is about to happen with AI in the next few decades, except for all business models. For all jobs. AI is not going to be a new industry. AI is going to be in every industry. It's going to be in every application, in every process in our society, in every aspect of our lives. Not just business and jobs, but also culture and art. Everything. AI is going to change what it means to be human.
So a lot of the occupations that exist in the world today are going to disappear, because we are going to automate nearly all current jobs. That's the nature of AI: automating an ever-growing range of intellectual tasks. And at the same time, a new world of opportunities is going to open up. A more exciting and much broader world of opportunities. We'll free up people's time to do more meaningful things. We'll transition to a different economy altogether --and it will be for the better. We will enter a new era of prosperity.
The previous technological revolution, the Internet revolution, turned out pretty well. The Internet didn't end up being owned by AOL or Microsoft. Today anybody can freely leverage the Internet for their own benefit: create their own website, publish a blog, or start their own business online. The world that the Internet created has turned out to be open --amazingly open, in fact, a world that empowers individuals like never before. But we shouldn't take it for granted that the same will happen for AI. We have to take action to make it so.
It's not a given that every technological revolution should turn out as a net positive for humanity, empowering individuals and bringing us higher potential for learning and creating, for self-direction and self-actualization. For instance, the original industrial revolution wasn't all rosy, and took a fairly dark turn for many people, which gave rise to communism and its horrors. In the long term, we ended up creating a much better society than the future industrial dystopia foreseen by Fritz Lang in Metropolis (1927). But could have it turned differently? Maybe.
It's our responsibility to make sure that this new revolution turns out all right, much like the previous one --the rise of the Internet 20 years ago. Our number one priority should be to make sure that the new opportunities created by AI are accessible to as many people as possible, essentially to anyone with a brain, a computer, and the will to learn. Much like almost anyone today can create a web app, because the tools and technologies underlying the web are easy to use, open-source, completely free, and learning resources are available everywhere with an Internet connection --again, for free. Of course, this is not about transitioning everyone to jobs that will involve AI, rather this is about making sure that all those who have the potential to create value with AI will be able to do so freely. This is about making sure that no human potential goes to waste. The value surplus induced by AI will benefit everyone, in much the same way that today a few millions of engineers and tech entrepreneurs create value that can sustain millions more jobs, and generate incredible benefits for billions of other people --easy and instant communications, a supercomputer in your pocket, the entire knowledge of humanity available at your fingertips.
The Internet has been a huge step forward for humanity as a whole and for each and every one of us. By automating a wide variety of intellectual tasks, AI has the potential to be just as beneficial, if not more. Now is the time to make sure that the transition into this brave new world goes as smoothly as the previous one. Everyone should be able to start using AI to solve their business problems, to answer the questions they have, in much the same way that every business today has a webpage and can leverage the Internet for everything from sales to marketing to inventory sourcing.
And you, as an early adopter of deep learning, you have a responsibility to make sure that the opportunities that AI will create are open to everyone. Because if you don't, then who will? This is the new frontier, and we want this frontier to be open, and stay open.
Importantly, that's not going to happen if one needs to be an expert in order to start using deep learning technology or AI in general, like it was the case just two years ago. And that's where Keras comes in. The purpose of Keras is to make deep learning accessible to anyone with an idea and with some basic computer science literacy. Keras was started as deep learning "for the masses", and it has been working beyond anything I could have foreseen. Keras has now dozens of great contributors, and a community of tens of thousands of users. Keras has been adopted by hundreds of researchers, thousands of grad students, and importantly, dozens of startups (even some large companies), all simply because it made deep learning easier to use. Recently I visited the folks at Comma.ai, who are building a car autopilot kit. I was blown away by what they had achieved with so little. In the beginning, George Hotz got started by hooking up a Keras convnet with a dashboard camera to generate steering commands. Why Keras? Because it was the easiest, simplest way to get the job done. I thought this was an amazing example of what happens when you start packaging advanced algorithms into an interface that anybody can use. In the long term, the value creation that will come from making deep learning accessible will be incredible.
Keras is just one step in that direction. Keras, together with TensorFlow and Theano, makes the barrier to entry much lower to start using state-of-the-art deep learning models to solve real problems. But making the tools accessible is just one side of the issue. The other side is to make the knowledge accessible. Explaining deep learning, its potential and its limitations. Building demos, writing tutorials. Inspiring and teaching. A big trend recently has been blog posts popularizing deep learning concepts, in particular the clear and practical articles from the blogs of Andrei Karpathy, Chris Olah, hardmaru or Stephen Merity, to just mention a few. More will follow in their footsteps, or so I hope. They fill a very important need.
Making deep learning more accessible should be one of our priorities. As early adopters, the responsibility falls on us. We must make sure that no one who has the potential to use deep learning to create value gets stopped by artificial obstacles, whether a scarcity of good learning resources, or arcane and hard-to-use tools that were developed with only experts in mind. The concepts behind deep learning are simple, so why should their application be difficult?
Democratizing AI is the best way, maybe the only way, to make sure that the future we are creating will be a good one.
Without further ado, here are my accessibility tips:
It's important to define the natural language of your document
Telling the browser which language you are using in your document has many benefits. It's good for SEO, it helps third-party translation tools and browsers to identify the right language and dictionary. Defining the correct language in an HTML page helps assistive technology to choose the correct voice profile or character set.(1) Adrian Roselli has gathered some more benefits of using the lang attribute on their website.
<html lang="en">
…
</html>
Watch a demonstration of the lang attribute in use on YouTube.
If you switch language within a document you can use the lang attribute on specific tags.(2)
<p>There is a certain <i lang="fr" class="idiomatic">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.</p>
Make sure to always define the right language. Steve Faulkner made a video that illustrates what happens if you don't use the lang attribute correctly. All language codes are listed in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.
You can hide content using the hidden attribute
If you want to hide content visually and from screen readers, use the hidden attribute.
Browser support for the hidden attribute is very good, except for IE 10 and lower. You can provide support for older browsers if you add this fallback to your CSS.
[hidden] {
display: none;
}
Sometimes it's better to add a blank alt attribute to an <img> element
If an image is used as content, apply the alt attribute to describe the images content and function succinctly. When you do that don't start with „Picture/Image/Graphic of…“, because the screen reader does that anyway.
If the image is purely decorative or doesn't add valuable information, consider embedding it with CSS as a background image. If you have/want to add it in HTML, don't remove the alt attribute, but leave it empty.(3)
<img src="decorative_image.jpg" alt="" />
It's important that you don't omit the alt attribute.
Omitting this attribute altogether indicates that the image is a key part of the content, and no textual equivalent is available. Setting this attribute to an empty string (alt=””) indicates that this image is not a key part of the content and that non-visual browsers may omit it from rendering. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img
There are some more tips on using the alt attribute on the The A11y Project page „Quick Tip: Using alt Text Properly “.
If you need a button, use the <button> element
In general, you should always favor native HTML elements, if there is one, over faking your own. For example, if you need a button, use the <button> element and not a <div> .
Buttons have many benefits/crucial features, for example:
Focusable

Screen readers identify them as buttons
Rob Dodson did a really great job explaining the benefits of an actual <button> over a <div> . Watch the A11ycasts episode „Just use button“ for more details and examples.
If you are not sure whether to use a button or a link, read Marcy Suttons post „Links vs. Buttons in Modern Web Applications“.
Structuring your markup correctly with headings is important
By creating a sound outline using headings <h1> - <h6> you are helping users to better understand the structure of your page and relationships between individual sections. On top of that, it will help users with assistive technology navigate. Screen readers provide different ways of moving from one piece of content to another. For example using the NVDA screen reader users can jump from heading to heading with shortcuts ( H and Shift + H ).
A demo of navigating a site by jumping from heading to heading
When you nest headings skipping levels should be avoided.(4) Also, don't use multiple nested <h1> elements to create the outline. Adrian Roselli explains why in their articles There Is No Document Outline Algorithm and The Truth about “The Truth About Multiple H1 Tags”.
<!-- Don't skip levels: -->
<body>
<h1>My website</h1>
<h4>Heading</h4>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Heading</h3>
</body>
<!-- Don't rely on inexistent outline algorithms: -->

tota11y provides a nice way of checking if your outline is persistent. Another way is to disable CSS and check if the page is readable and the structure makes sense.

Using landmarks helps people navigate your site
It is possible and advised to mark up thematic sections with HTML5 ( <article> , <aside> , <nav> , <section> ). You can also use WAI-ARIA role attributes for older browsers or sections that don't have an explicit tag like search.(5) Sectioning elements are not a replacement for the <div> element. Use them to mark up bigger chunks of related content which are distinct from other content. Don't overuse sectioning elements. Use <div> for CSS/JS only purposes and sections for semantics.
One of the main benefits is that screen reader users will be able to navigate pages by jumping from section to section. These navigable sections are called landmarks.(7) Watch a demonstration of landmark navigation on YouTube.
<body>
<header> <!-- landmark -->
<nav> <!-- landmark -->
...
</nav>
</header>
<aside> <!-- landmark -->
</aside>
</body>
You can simulate the feature of jumping from landmark to landmark with a browser extension called Landmarks. Press Alt + Shift + N to move to the next and Alt + Shift + P to move to the previous landmark.
If you want to learn more about sections, check out the Web Accessibility Tutorials page about sections.
Please note that not all software will treat every potential landmark as such.
The main page content, header, and footer are also landmarks
By wrapping the main content of your site in a <main> element you give some screen users the ability to jump directly to your main content using a shortcut. „The main element represents the main content section of the body of a document or application“ and must not be used more than once per document (5).
As already stated splitting up your content into landmarks is a good thing. <header> and <footer> behave in all major browsers like landmarks if they are not nested in a <section> or <article> element. If you need support for older browsers, you can turn your main site header and footer into landmarks using the role attribute with the values banner for the header and contentinfo for the footer.(6)
<!-- The extra role attributes are only important for older browsers -->
<body>
<header role="banner">

<h2>Blog posts</h2>

Fieldsets are great for grouping form elements and giving them more context
You've probably been at the point where you had to add several radio buttons or checkboxes to a form. Adding the form elements and the corresponding labels usually isn't a big deal. But which element do you choose, if you want to label the whole group of radio buttons or checkboxes?
<form>
Shirt size
<input type="radio" id="s" name="shirtsize" />
<label for="s">S</label>
<input type="radio" id="m" name="shirtsize" />
<label for="m">M</label>
<input type="radio" id="l" name="shirtsize" />
<label for="l">L</label>
</form>
How do you mark up Shirt size? A <p> will probably work, but it isn't associated with the group of radio buttons.
A much better approach is to wrap everything in a fieldset and put T-Shirt size in a <legend> tag. Screen readers will know that <legend> is associated with the radio buttons and read out its value whenever a radio button is selected.
<form>
<fieldset>
<legend>T-Shirt size</legend>
<input type="radio" id="s" name="shirtsize" />
<label for="s">S</label>
<input type="radio" id="m" name="shirtsize" />
<label for="m">M</label>
<input type="radio" id="l" name="shirtsize" />
<label for="l">L</label>
</fieldset>
</form>
Like with <section> be considerate when wrapping form elements in fieldsets. As a rule of thumb only use <fieldset> if you have multiple form elements that form a group and a corresponding label for that group, something that fits in a <legend> .

Israel's victory in the June 1967 Six Day War provided a unique opportunity for resolving the decades-old Arab-Zionist conflict. Having seized the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights, Israel for the first time in its history had something concrete to offer its Arab neighbors: it could trade land for peace. Yet the political deadlock persisted after the guns fell silent. This book sets out to find out why.
Avi Raz places Israel's conduct under an uncompromising lens. They meticulously examine the critical two years following the June war and substantially revises our understanding of how and why Israeli-Arab secret contacts came to naught. Mining newly declassified records in Israeli, American, British, and UN archives, as well as private papers of individual participants, Raz dispels the myth of overall Arab intransigence and arrives at new and unexpected conclusions. In short, they conclude that Israel's postwar diplomacy was deliberately ineffective because its leaders preferred land over peace with its neighbors. The book throws a great deal of light not only on the post-1967 period but also on the problems and pitfalls of peacemaking in the Middle East today.
Canada's men's basketball team went into its first second-round game at the FIBA Americas Championship on Sunday with a clear goal.
They accomplished it emphatically with a 103-66 thrashing of Panama.
Brady Heslip poured in 23 points off the bench, including seven of Canada's 14 three-pointers and Andrew Wiggins added 17 points.
Nik Stauskas had 16 points and Cory Joseph chipped in with 15 for a Canadian team that outrebounded Panama 53-28.
"Our goal was to rebound and see if we could get out in transition," said Canadian coach Jay Triano. "We were able to wear them down by continually running and doing a good job on defence."
Jonathan King led Panama with 13 points.
Defence was the story of the first quarter, as Canada forced seven turnovers and held Panama scoreless from the 6:30 mark. Joseph scored nine points in the first 10 minutes to propel Canada to a 20-10 lead.
Panama made just nine field goals by the half and Canada went into the break up 42-23. The Canadians led 77-43 after three quarters.
The top two teams from the tournament qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio next summer.
Canada plays Uruguay on Monday.
"We know that (Monday) is going to be a tough game but it is good to start the second round with a win," said Heslip.
Canada's men's team has not participated in a summer Games since 2000.
Roundup
Luis Scola had 26 points and 13 rebounds and Argentina overcame an 11-point deficit to beat Uruguay 90-87 and remain undefeated.
Andres Nocioni added 22 points, and Facundo Campazzo had 15 for Argentina.
Mexico also remained perfect, beating Puerto Rico 92-86. Hector Hernandez had 28 points and 12 rebounds, and Paul Stoll made a key 3-pointer with 33 seconds left for Mexico.
Earlier, Nestor Colmenares scored 19 points and Venezuela broke a two-game losing streak with a 72-68 victory over the Dominican Republic to remain in contention for the semifinals.
The road ahead
The top four teams after the four second-round matches will qualify for the semifinals.
The top two teams will get two berths to Rio in 2016. The teams finishing from third to fifth will qualify for the 2016 FIBA Olympic qualifying tournament, set to be played on July 4-10.
Rogue states are also increasing their efforts to secure chemical and biological weapons, and the means to deploy them, leaving billions in the world's most densely populated area at risk of a devastating strike, the documents show.
States such as North Korea, Syria and Iran are developing long-range missiles capable of hitting targets outside the region, records of top-level security briefings obtained by WikiLeaks show.
Long-running hostilities between India and Pakistan – which both have nuclear weapons capabilities – are at the root of fears of a nuclear conflict in the region. A classified Pentagon study estimated in 2002 that a nuclear war between the two countries could result in 12 million deaths.
Secret records of a US security briefing at an international non-proliferation summit in 2008 stated that “a nuclear and missile arms race [in South Asia] has the direct potential to lead to nuclear war in the world's most densely populated area and a region of increasing global economic significance”.
The same briefing gave warning that development of cruise and ballistic missiles in the Middle East and Asia could enable rogue states to fire weapons of mass destruction into neighbouring regions.
The leaked documents also disclose alarming details of the chemical and biological weapons programmes being pursued by rogue states such as Syria and North Korea.
Syria - which backs the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah – is believed to be developing chemical weapons using the lethal nerve agents sarin and VX, which shut down the nervous system in under a minute if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
In December 2008, a company connected to the Syrian WMD programme attempted to buy a shipment of glass-lined reactors, heat exchangers and pumps used in weapons manufacturing from two Indian firms, prompting an intervention by the US.
Condoleezza Rice, then US Secretary of State, sent a strongly-worded cable classified “secret” to the US embassy in New Delhi instructing diplomats to order the Indian government to block the sale.
Threatening sanctions against the firms if they did not comply, Miss Rice urged embassy officials to remind the Indian government of its obligation “to never, under any circumstances, assist anyone in the development of chemical weapons”.
The US has made similar interventions to block the sale of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons materials to North Korea.
In March 2008, US diplomats in Beijing urged the government to investigate a Chinese company which had agreed to sell a deadly chemical to North Korea.
The US has also been advised to make flattering overtures to North Korea to prevent the regime from feeling the need to flex its muscles by advancing its nuclear capabilities.
South Korean politicians told US diplomats last year that the North had made a show of testing nuclear missiles in the early months of Barack Obama's presidency because it was “feeling ignored and lonely” and was “trying to draw America's attention”.
I was lucky/unlucky to attend Peter Greenaway's lecture on Cinema in Pietrasanta, Italy. After a tumultuous (lack of) introduction the filmmaker's dramatic voice quickly started provoking and capturing the audience. Cinema is dead. Who killed it? In Italy, was it Berlusconi? Or (as suggested by someone in the audience) was it simply Italian laziness? Greenaway is not the first nor the last to wonder about ‘the death of Cinema'. Recently, Tarantino's now famous statement regarding celluloid rapidly bounced around the web gaining momentum and critiques. Greenaway's reasoning appears to be different, as they accuse the likes of Tarantino to be suffering from the “Casablanca syndrome”. They believe Cinema has been broken from within, incapable of adapting to a changing world.
I have taken the liberty to paraphrase some of their statements in the few paragraphs below.
People suffering the Casablanca syndrome are nostalgics who still believe in sitting in the dark for two hours looking at a white rectangle of light. We now have easy access to the consumption of content and to the tools required for creations of all kinds. The Trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit has been replaced by the new trinity of the mobile phone, the laptop and the manufacturing process (for example the camera). We are aware that Cinema is on the change, and changing very very rapidly.
Greenaway is very interested in the concept of Cinema outside of Cinema. We are at the beginning of an extraordinary ‘Age of the Screen'. Screens are all around us. Cameras are all around us. “Cinema” is now a minority activity. Its importance has been declining, submerged by other screens. Even broadcast television is declining and being replaced by a ‘television of choice'. We ought to make audiovisual material alive to these new characteristics and continue to fulfil the need for audiovisual excitement in a contemporary way.
We should ‘go with the flow' and maximise this age of the screen. The ‘democratisation' of cinema is the result of the availability and accessibility of affordable “filmmaking tools” and distribution platforms. These new channels of communication allow the makers to ‘bypass' the traditional distribution, the filtering and censorship, and directly connect to an audience. The ‘old powers' have lost their grip on our imagination. Are they trying to maintain Cinema or “Cinema Money”?
These new freedoms should be used. Storytellers are forced to condense or expand stories in order to fit the existing moulds, creating situation of extraordinary absurdity and thus fossilising the formatting based on finances and not on “Cinema”. We can now pick and chose our media to take into account the needs of our audiovisiual creations. ‘What medium would fit my imagination?' as opposed to ‘how to fit my imagination into a specific medium?'
“Unless you believe something to be broken, you will not try to mend it“ Greenaway believes cinema is broken. While creating their ‘New Cinema' they consider 4 parameters they believe to be essential to an ‘individual cinema'. The following 4 tyrannies have always been a problem with cinema, and are now destroying it from within.
1) The Tyranny of the Text: we do not have an image based cinema. Cinema starts with texts in 99.99% of the cases. Literary adaptations, screenplays or excessive use of dialogue are all existing proofs. ‘Cinema should not be the illustration of text'.
2) The Tyranny of the Frame: “The frame does not exist in nature.” It does not represent the way we perceive the world. “Why do we continue to play with this aberration?”
3) The Tyranny of the Actor: “Cinema does not exist to be a playground for Johnny Depp. And, it isn't Johnny Deep's fault. It is the way we use Johnny Depp, the way we manipulate their imagination, their ability, their talent.” “We force an actor to subsume their individuality in terms of fictions that do not belong in their imagination at all.”
4) The Tyranny of the Camera: “A boring mechanical instrument with no intelligence. An image manufacturing process based on mimeses.” Greenaway seems more interested in the notion of creation. First, quoting Picasso: “I do not paint what I see, I paint what I think.” Then, quoting Eisenstein: ”The greatest filmmaker ever is Walt Disney” They added: “Cartoons start from nothing, unlike the notion of the camera which captures the known and given world”
Peter Greenaway attempts are directed at creating a non-narrative, multiscreen cinema in the present tense, without forgetting the pleasure principle of entertaining; doing whatever we can to capture and maintain the audience's attention.
We were not able to verify how well Greenaway is capable of fighting these 4 tyrannies and fit within the boundaries (or lack of) they propose . Sadly, the projection of their short projects could not go ahead (for reasons that are so surreal that they will not be shared). I hope to get another chance at discovering these less ‘conventional' creations, as my curiosity has been stimulated by Greenaway's provocations. I cannot hide that I enjoy provocation. I believe that without questioning authorities we are guilty of giving momentum to a variety of vicious circles, simply by accepting what is not acceptable (and often reproducing what we did not accept at first).
I am intrigued as their words resonate in my mind. After all, writing a script is the tedious task of translating the sensorial audiovisual creation of my imagination to text. Why not bypass it?
There are already examples of multiscreen experiences (2nd screen implementations, experimental multiscreen projections or even VR headsets) in existence. Why not take advantage of these additional available spaces to create a less ‘static' experience?
There are also numerous examples of directors giving vast freedoms to their actors, involving them and their imagination in the creative process (and even films with no real-life actors being involved). Why always force them to surrender to our imagination? (Is it our ego talking? or marketing?)
How could I get rid of the camera? I am unsure as to how Mr Greenaway intends to fight this last tyranny. But, I can understand how the camera is limited to reproducing the real world. However, the real world can be enhanced (on set or location) or even altered (in postproduction) thus bringing ‘it' closer to our imagination.
I do not suffer the Casablanca Syndrome (ok, maybe I do, but I label it with a different title). I am aware, though, that change is not only exhilarating and empowering, it is also scary. We cannot foresee where it will bring us, whether we will like the ‘new formats' it creates and whether there will be room for our imagination (and professional livelihood) in these ‘new media'. “There is nothing wrong with Casablanca. It is simply boring, as every time we watch if it is always the same.” We have to remake it in a new way.

Three Things I Love About Git
git-commit --amend
One of the benefits of using version control is organization. When you commit a set of changes, you are implicitly marking that set as defining a certain feature set, or otherwise having something in common.
Have you ever committed something, then realized you forgot to include something with it? Maybe it's a new file, or maybe it's an extra small change you forgot to make.
Enter git-commit --amend . The amend option adds to the tip of the current branch, and actually replaces the last commit with the combined change! It even seeds the message editor with the last commit's description, so you don't have to type it in again.
git-checkout -b
I often like to work in branches, even if what I'm implementing is not large enough to make a branch-commits-merge cycle really necessary. I find that making frequent small commits, without needing to think about whether the product is fully stable each commit, helps me focus and develop more quickly and cleanly.
In most VCSs, branching is something that takes a bit of effort, and for maximum ease, you want to plan it ahead of time. Sometimes I start developing, and suddenly decide what I'm working on is going to be big enough that I want to use a branch. I'm now forced to decide whether I want to make the effort to "backport" the work done so far.
With git-checkout -b , it becomes a very easy decision. This command says "create a new branch, based off the last commit, and transfer my working copy to this branch in-place, so I can commit to the branch as I please." I just execute git-checkout -b new_branch_name and keep going, with no interruption to my train of thought or work flow.
(Bonus: merging is relatively painless in git, especially compared to most centralized version control systems. Which just makes the ease of branching even more valuable.)
Fine-grained commits
Like I mentioned, one valuable benefit of using version control is organization: by making intelligent commits, code content diffs are automatically organized by feature set.
Sometimes, when I'm ready to commit, I have changes I want to include mixed in with some I do not. Or, I decide it would make more sense to split the current set of changes across several commits.
An example from this week: I was editing a Makefile, and realized it contained three sets of changes that really had nothing to do with each other.Had the make file been split up into several physical files, perhaps it would have been trivial to put into separate commits, but it in reality it was just one physical file.
Most VC tools I know of can resolve commit changes only down to the individual file level - they don't get fine grained enough that you can tell them, "commit this part of this file, and that part of that file, but not these other parts". You can always hack around it, by manually editing and reverting, etc. But that's often not easy nor quick.
But lo! I have a friend in git-commit --interactive . This starts up a shell that allows you to selectively add individual changes, what git calls "hunks", to the staging area for committing. In this case, the Makefile had three of these hunks. You can split up any hunk into smaller hunks, if you want to control what you're committing with even finer granularity. You can review the change set as you build it, adding, deleting or refining changes as you like. When satisfied, I exit, and the change set is automatically committed.
That's for the simple case of one file. It can be an even more powerful tool with a larger change set.

I also think living as an expat has slowed me down — in a good way. It's definitely made me a better listener. I don't judge people so much, and I'm starting to understand why China is the way it is.
But there are common threads that run through the lives of every expat. If you were to make a tag cloud of recurring worries on relevant forums, themes like 'homesickness', 'language' and 'Skype connection' would loom large.
Away from the safety net of home, uncertainty is perhaps the one thing that unites all expats. HSBC's 2014 Expat Explorer survey revealed that 35% of those interviewed claim a lack of job security is their biggest worry, while a further 30% cite the state of the local economy as the main source of their anxieties.
So, given that uncertainty, why make the leap? To answer that question, we spoke to three expats who have lived and worked all over the world to find out what impact moving had on them both emotionally and practically.
La dolce vita
Italian expat couple Marco Raugei, 40, and Daniela Russi, 38, spent five years living in Spain before moving to London in 2012.
"When I moved to Barcelona [to be with Russi, who was studying there], I couldn't speak a word of Spanish," Raugei admitted. "But I tend to be an optimist and we were eager to start living together.”
For environmental policy analyst Russi, who moved to Spain as a student in 2001, the switch to London proved more trying.
"I missed my friends in Barcelona," they confided. "Also, Spanish is quite close to Italian, so it was easy to pick up. Learning English has been harder. At first, it was difficult to understand my colleagues and I didn't have time to study the language. But I love books, so I began reading novels only in English to improve my vocabulary."
Now happily living in North London, and with a newborn baby to occupy their days, both Raugei and Russi agree the chances of moving again are slimmer. For Raugei, however, expat life has been a liberating experience.
"It's similar to the feeling you get on holiday. There's that same sense of freedom. You always have something to discover and it keeps you curious… Yes, if I had only lived in Italy I would perhaps have a stronger sense of being Italian.”
Russi feels less certain. "I feel rich because I had the chance to have many different experiences. On the other hand, you don't feel complete. If I'm in Italy, I miss my life here; if I'm here, I miss my friends in Spain. I think one of the conditions of being an expat is that you don't feel you belong anywhere."
"…Or perhaps you belong everywhere," Raugei added.
Out of Africa
Originally born in Malawi to Irish parents, Dubliner Ceire Sadlier, 32, relocated with their husband to Africa in 2006. Two kids, eight years and three countries (Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania) later, they and their family moved back home in late 2014.
"My parents had lived abroad for 35 years, so I thought it would be second nature, but it's hard," said Sadlier. "Right from the start in Zambia, we were reliant on my husband's employers to set everything up. They picked our house and the area we lived in, but there was no water, intermittent electricity, and it was full of cockroaches."
Having found a new home, settling at work was the next issue.
"I got a job at a [non-governmental organisation] NGO and as the only non-local there it could get lonely. There was a financial divide between us, and in Zambian culture if you invite someone out you have to pay for them,” Sadlier said. “The only place I was ever invited to be church. I didn't make many local friends until I volunteered at a youth centre for street kids.
"Many expats in Dar es Salaam [Tanzania] live on the Masani Peninsula. Walking down the street, you could easily be in a European city. The only way to escape it is to learn [Swahili] the local language. There, it was expected of you and people would be encouraging,” explained Sadlier. “Sport also helps — badminton is a big social event for everyone."
These days, Sadlier admits it would take a lot for them to move abroad again, with the financial benefit of higher wages offset by the potential drain of costly international school fees.
"Some companies offer to pay for your children's education in full, others pay a portion. For us, we received 6,000 euros ($6,819) per child. But if, say, the American International School charges 17,500 euros ($19,891) annually, unless you're both working or you've a really good contract, it's tough."
For Sadlier, homesickness has never subsided and their biggest regret is perhaps not quite embracing life abroad as much as she'd have liked, but there were still benefits, they believe.
"I wasn't confident. When I got to Zambia I found it hard to go to events, and it would suck a lot of energy meeting people, but you have to go through that cycle to settle,” Sadlier reflected.
“Now I find it a lot easier to walk into a room with strangers and enjoy it. I also learned that it's OK to love my country and love being there.”
China syndrome
Back in 2012, Spanish cinematographer and documentarian Marc Martinez Sarrado, 40, was editing in Paris when they got a call offering them a job. "It was in China, and they told me I could take three days to think… I didn't need any and said yes right away."
It wasn't Martinez Sarrado's first experience of Asia; he'd already spent two years flitting between Paris and Thailand for various film projects. Still, little prepared them for life in China.
"When you arrive it's as different as you can imagine. Initially, I was in Shanghai for six months and compared to Beijing, where I've been living since, it was far more Western. In Beijing fewer people speak English and it doesn't feel as cosmopolitan,” they said.
Even where they live now, in Beijing's expat-heavy Sanlitun area, language has been the biggest hurdle. Excluding the dialectic switch from Shanghainese to Beijing Mandarin, just mastering the basics requires time, which Martinez Sarrado found difficult to set aside while working.
Ultimately, the most difficult adjustment for the Spaniard turned out to be environmental rather than cultural."I feel ashamed. For the job, I have assistants, but on a daily basis it's a handicap,” they said. “Still, even though I don't speak Mandarin, I use body language — and it works. It's just a matter of breaking barriers and a friendly smile often helps when communicating in China."
"I come from Barcelona, so I'm used to having breakfast on the beach. I knew before that China was polluted, but I thought: let's see how bad it is, maybe spring will be better. Then summer came, then autumn. I wear a mask all year round while cycling. I also spent over 1,000 euros ($1,140) on air purifiers because it gets in the flat too."
Nevertheless, Martinez Sarrado has no regrets about moving.
"Beijing is kind of wild. You can go with a bicycle everywhere, and sometimes it creates chaos, but everyone understands. Here, it's a friendly chaos,” they said. “I also think living as an expat has slowed me down — in a good way. It's definitely made me a better listener. I don't judge people so much, and I'm starting to understand why China is the way it is."

strong>TL;DR: download the JWT Handbook here!
If you've read any recent article or blog post that talks about modern authentication, you've undoubtedly heard about JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). If you're like many, you may have heard or even played around with JWTs, but never fully understood what they are all about.
At Auth0, we live and breathe JSON Web Tokens. It is our goal to make the Internet a safer place, and we feel that JWTs can help. We wrote this handbook to give you a one-stop shop for all things JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) so that you can learn everything you ever wanted to know about tokens and token-based authentication.
Get the free ebook today.
JSON Web Token is an IETF open standard (RFC 7519) aimed at providing a well defined way of exchanging verified claims between two or more parties. That's a fancy way of saying “it's a defined method of sharing data that can be verified to be valid.”
The biggest benefit to using JWTs is that they are compact and self contained. JWTs are also relatively ease to learn and use. Every major language and framework supports JWTs in some shape or form.
JWTs have found their way into several authentication frameworks. The most important of these is OpenID Connect, an authentication layer built on top of OAuth2. Modern authentication is difficult to get right, but following well established standards such as those defined with the JWT RFC, can make the process much more manageable.
The obvious place to look for information regarding JSON Web Tokens would be it's official specification. However, the full spectrum of JWT and associated technologies is scattered between five different RFCs: JSON Web Token (RFC 7519), JSON Web Signature (RFC 7515), JSON Web Encryption (RFC 7516), JSON Web Key (RFC 7517), and JSON Web Algorithms (RFC 7518). Putting all the pieces together can be a daunting task. This is where the JWT Handbook comes into play.
The JWT Handbook was born out of our personal experience working with JSON Web Tokens at Auth0. It is a collection of all that is necessary to learn, understand, and use JWTs, with practical applications and full code examples. Here is what you will find in the current version of the handbook:
An in-depth introduction to JSON Web Tokens and why they matter
Practical applications with full code examples, including federated identity and stateless sessions
Full details on how to construct and parse JWTs
Details on how signatures work and can be created and verified
Encryption and decryption with JSON Web Tokens
JSON Web Keys definition and practical applications
Descriptions of signing algorithms that can be used with JWTs (currently in progress).
We aim at providing frequent updates and examples that provide deeper insights into JWTs in future releases of the handbook.
Whether you are totally new to JWTs or a veteran looking to expand your knowledge, the Auth0 JWT Handbook is sure to have something in store for you. You can get the book for free, by paying with a tweet, here.
We hope you find the handbook a useful reference for all things JWT! Keep in touch for future updates.
Rubio, along with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, took the unprecedented step of vowing never to publically criticize Israel, just the latest codification of the GOP as the Washington-based arm of Bibi Netanyahu's Likud Party. But when it comes to marriage equality, an issue which enjoys the strong support of American Jews, Rubio explained:
“We are clearly called in the Bible to adhere to our civil authorities. But that conflicts with also our requirement to adhere to God's rules. So when those two come in conflict, God's rules always win.”
And whose God might that be? Urging their supporters forward, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz proclaimed, “If we awaken and energize the body of Christ–if Christians and people of faith come out and vote our values–we will win and we will turn the country around.”His wife Heidi recently boasted that as president, their husband Ted would show America “the face of God,” that is, “this Christian God that we serve is the foundation of our country.” And among the hundreds of evangelical pastors who rallied to Cruz's support in Iowa, South Carolina, and around the country is Mike Bickle, founder and director of the Kansas City-based International House of Prayer. As the Times of Israel helpfully recalled:
Bickle runs the Israel Mandate project, an effort to convert Jews to Christianity, which runs daily livestreamed prayer services for “the nation of Israel to receive their Jewish Messiah, Yeshua (Jesus),” according to its website. In recent years, Bickle has delivered numerous sermons that predict a new era of Holocaust-like conditions for Jews before the Second Coming, insisting that the Jews who do not recognize Jesus as their messiah will either die or be sent to prison or concentration camps. Perhaps most famously, they have suggested that a passage from Jeremiah 16:16 explains how Adolf Hitler's murder of more than six million Jews was permitted by God.
If that message sounds vaguely familiar, it should. Back in 2008, Republican nominee John McCain accepted the endorsement of Pastor John Hagee, only to disavow them after their own lectures about Jeremiah and how “Hitler was a hunter” became public. But as the founder and leader of Christians United for Israel (CUFI), Hagee remains a very big deal in Republican circles.
CUFI for years has featured American politicians, leaders of major American Jewish organizations, and Israeli ambassadors only too eager to mobilize evangelical's backing and cash for Eretz Israel. Their mission? According to the organization's “Israel Pledge:”
We believe that the Jewish people have a right to live in their ancient land of Israel, and that the modern State of Israel is the fulfillment of this historic right.
That historic right was God's gift to the Jews, Their Chosen People.
Unfortunately for the likes of Hagee, Gary Bauer, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, and the rest of the crowd which gathers at the annual CUFI gatherings in Washington each year, most Jewish Americans do not share that belief.
After all, surveys show that while 44 percent of Americans—and only 40 percent of American Jews—believe Israel was given by God to the Jewish people, among Israeli Jews the share identifying themselves as God's Chosen People reaches 70 percent. As it turns out, far and away the group most dedicated to the proposition that God gave the Land of Israel to the Jewish people is American white evangelical Protestants. And their End Times story doesn't end well for Jews anywhere.
In its October 2013 analysis, the Pew Research Center reported that at a whopping 82 percent, “A majority of white evangelicals believe God gave the land of Israel to the Jewish people, compared with 40 percent of American Jews who believe the same.” But just as jaw-dropping as the fact that white evangelicals are twice as likely as American Jews (40 percent), and five times more like than “Jews of no religion” (16 percent) to believe this are the implications for U.S. policy: White evangelical Protestants also are more likely than Jews to favor stronger U.S. support of Israel. Among Jews, 54% say American support of the Jewish state is “about right,” while 31% say the U.S. is not supportive enough. By contrast, more white evangelical Protestants say the U.S. is not supportive enough of Israel (46%) than say support is about right (31%).White evangelical Protestants are less optimistic than Jews about the prospects for a peaceful two-state solution to conflict in the region. When asked if there is a way for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully, six-in-ten American Jews (61%) say yes, while one-third say no. Among white evangelical Protestants, 42% say Israel and an independent Palestinian state can coexist peacefully, while 50% say this is not possible. Not possible and for many evangelicals, not desirable. After all, in their eschatology, the conversion of some Jews—and the slaughter of the rest—at Armageddon is part and parcel to the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and the Second Coming of Christ. That helps explain why white evangelical Protestants love the Jews, giving them an impressive 69 on Pew's 100 degree thermometer. Alas, that love goes unrequited: “Despite evangelicals' warm feelings toward Jews, Jews tend to give evangelicals a much cooler rating (34 on average).” For Christian Zionists like former Rep. Michele Bachmann (“Support for Israel is handed down by God and if the United States pulls back its support, America will cease to exist”), Gov. Rick Perry (“As a Christian I have a clear directive to support Israel”) and Mike Huckabee (“no such thing as a Palestinian”), Israel serves merely as a means to an end. In that telling, it is a divinely required steppingstone to the End Times conversion (and much larger slaughter) of the Jews that will accompany the Second Coming of Christ. And that has a real impact on foreign policy. As the controversial head of the Christians United for Israel, Pastor John Hagee, explained in 2006: “The United States must join Israel in a pre-emptive military strike against Iran to fulfill God's plan for both Israel and the West … a biblically prophesied end-time confrontation with Iran, which will lead to the Rapture, Tribulation, and Second Coming of Christ.” With friends like that, Israel doesn't need enemies. And with Republicans like that, it's no wonder American Jews continue to overwhelmingly vote Democratic. Other recent surveys of American Jews confirm what the exit polls tell us every four years: The Jewish electorate is perhaps the single most liberal voting bloc in the United States. A poll conducted two years ago by the Berman Jewish Policy Archive at New York University revealed why the Jewish community continues to reliably vote for Democrats, “election cycle after election cycle:” The poll, which has a four percent margin of error, also found high support among Jews not just for social causes they have long championed including gay marriage (68 percent support) and access to legal abortion (63 percent favor), but on economic issues such as taxation. Sixty-five percent said they support raising income tax for those who earn above $200,000 a year and 62 percent said they thought the power of financial institutions pose a threat to the United States.The survey also found that 73 percent of those polled favored the government requiring private health insurance to cover birth control. As Haaretz noted in reporting on the survey, “Israel-related issues seem to have little effect on Jewish voters' decision in choosing between Obama and Romney.” That finding echoed the results of an April 2012 poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, a not-for-profit, nonpartisan organization: A majority of 51% pointed to the economy as the issue most important to their vote, followed by gaps between rich and poor (15%), health care (10%) and the federal deficit (7%). Only 4% of Jewish voters said Israel was the most important issue for them when deciding who should get their vote. Even when asked to name their second-most-important issue, Jewish voters gave the issue of Israel only marginal importance.The data would suggest that the Republicans' focus on attacking both Obama's record on Israel and their troubled relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was having little, if any, traction. Which turned out to be exactly right. In 2012, Mitt Romney as predicted won evangelicals by a staggering 59 points. But despite the campaign of right-wing demagoguery, despite the National Review's boasting in 2011 that “only 43 percent of Jewish voters would reelect Obama” and Dan Senor's lectures about “why Obama is losing the Jewish vote,” President Obama crushed Gov. Romney by 69 to 30 percent among Jewish voters.
That dismal reality has led some of the GOP faithful to lash out. Breitbart columnist Ben Shapiro called the Obama administration “obviously anti-Israel” and, despite its large number of Jewish staff and advisors, “borderline Jew-hating.” In March 2014, Michele Bachmann lamented to Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council that the American Jewish community “sold out Israel.” The 2014 war in Gaza and the 2015 showdown between Netanyahu and Obama over the Iran nuclear deal reanimated Republican hopes of “Jewish voters drifting away from Democrats.” But taking on the sitting American President, Netanyahu lost and AIPAC lost even bigger.
Still, Republican Jewish Coalition Executive Director Matt Brooks predicts happy days ahead for the GOP. They recently cited exit polls that showed the Republican share of Jewish voters tripling between 1992 and 2012. “Election after election we continue to make gains and inroads,” Brooks said. “The Democrats are on the wrong side of the trend line.” But while it's true that George W. Bush picked up only 11 percent of Jewish voters in 1992, Ronald Reagan collected 31 and 39 percent during their two campaigns for the White House. And given the 2016 GOP presidential field, Shalev argued in December, it takes a lot of chutzpah for Republicans to be optimistic this year:
Seventy-one percent of American Jews support environmental regulations – so they'll vote for a candidate (Marco Rubio) who denies global warming and says such regulation “will ruin America's economy”? Nearly 80 percent of Jews think that society should accept homosexuality – so they would vote for a party whose candidate (Ted Cruz) backs “conversion therapy” and thinks homosexual conduct is “a choice”? Seventy-seven percent of American Jews support gay marriage – so they'll vote for a candidate (Ben Carson) who has pledged to constitutionally overturn the June 2015 Supreme Court decision allowing it? Sixty-seven percent of American Jews support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants – so they'll vote for a candidate (Donald Trump) who thinks they should all be deported by force or who suggested after the Paris terror attacks that a religious group such as Muslims should be required to bear special identity cards? Finally, no less than 84 percent (!) of American Jews support legal abortion – so they'll support a party whose candidates oppose legal abortions across the board, including some (Carson, Rubio, Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum) who would outlaw abortions even in cases of rape and incest? Forget about it.
At least for 2016.
If there is a saving grace (pun intended) for Republicans, it is this: Orthodox Jews, currently about 10 percent of America's Jewish population, are younger, marrying sooner (and within the faith), and having more children than their counterparts. And as the Pew Research Center summed it up, it's clear why the growing share of Orthodox could be so important for Republicans:
Compared with other U.S. Jews, Orthodox Jews are far more socially and politically conservative. When the survey was conducted in 2013, 57% of Orthodox Jews said they identified with or leaned toward the Republican Party. By contrast, just 18% of other Jews identified with or leaned toward the GOP. Orthodox Jews were also much more likely than other Jews to self-identify as politically conservative (54% vs. 16%).
Of course, demography isn't always destiny, especially when people like Mike Huckabee accuse President Obama of preparing to “march Israelis to the door of the oven” and Michele Bachmann calls for converting as many Jews as possible because Jesus is “coming soon.” So Republicans hoping for a spike in Jewish support shouldn't expect any miracles in 2016. But they can always dream: “Next year in Washington!”
Secular Jewishness; what's Jewish about it?
An excerpt from Sholom Aleichem Club News & Comment - By Max Rosenfeld
(The following is excerpted from a talk given at the Center Island Jewish School, Freeport, L.I., on April 18, 1975) In the Book of Exodus, which tells the story of the liberation of the Hebrews from Egyptian slavery, God tells Moses to go down to Egypt and lead the children of Israel out. Moses protests, "Why me?" And God says, "Never mind why you. I will be with you and you will lead them out." Moses tries again. "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them 'the God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is Their name?' what shall I tell them?"
Well, that's where the trouble started, because God was caught by surprise. They didn't have a name. Only finite things like idols have names. So finally They said (or maybe They said, because we can't tell the gender from the structure of the words): "Ehiye asher ehiye. I am who I am. Tell the children of Israel that 'I Am' sent you to them. I am who I am, and that's all the definition you're going to get from me."
I wish I could say - what God said: "Secular Jewishness is what it is and don't try to define it." But then God didn't have to write statements of philosophy for conferences or preambles for Jewish organizations.
So, I'll try to answer it as well as I know how, but let me note that the question already assumes a couple of things. First, I prefer the term secular Jewishness, not secular Judaism. The way I understand the words, "secular Judaism' is a contradiction. Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people. Secularism is an absence of religious orientation. (This idea should be simple enough to explain; just as simple as trying to define who is a Jew, and you know how uncomplicated that has gotten to be in recent years.)
For some people, however, even the words "secular Jewishness" are mutually exclusive; for them, Jewishness (Yiddishkeit) is inconceivable without the idea of the divine origin of the Torah and the worship of the divinity who gave it. Well, they are entitled to their opinion, and they can try to convince the world, just so long as they don't try to exclude me out of the Jewish people by their definition. It's a waste of energy (which we all know nowadays is not an unlimited resource) to try to con¬vince a person who sees the world that way that I also am Jewish. My purpose is only to tell those people who are looking for an alternative to "religious Jewishness" that there is one, and that this alternative has a history and a tradition which, although it may not go all the way back to Mt. Sinai, still has strong roots in Jewish life and thought.
The word "secularism" is not new in American Jewish life. I remember reading authors, in the 1950s, who argued that secularism in American Jewish life had proved to be a failure. They were also entitled to their opinion, but they didn't deny the legitimacy of secularism as a stream in Jewish life. They merely said it had no future in the U.S. because of the structure of American society. We had a flourishing secularist Jewish culture here for at least fifty years (1890-1940), a variegated culture, parts of which were even in conflict with each other — a luxury which proved disastrous. But the common denominator of the earlier secular groups was the Yiddish language, and how could anything Yiddish not be Jewish?
Secondly, to me there is a difference even between the concepts of "Jewish secularism" and "secular Jewishness." Jewish secularism is a broad idea that stands for the separation of religious authority from the private lives of members of the Jewish community. There are religious Jews who believe that Jewish community organization should be on a secular basis. (Professor Horace Kallen once wrote a book called "Secularism Is The Will Of God"!) Back in 1949, Mordecai Kaplan wrote, "The majority of Jews today do not identify their Jewishness with any positive religious convictions. And this applies not only to the very considerable number of Jews who are avowed secularists." Secular Jewishness more specifically describes the kind of Jewishness we're talking about. There is a religious Jewishness, and there is a secular Jewishness.
I mentioned that secular Jewishness may not go all the way back to the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai. But even here we can draw a secular parable. To the secularist the primary fact is that there was a group of people to whom Moses gave the Torah. The people were there first. They produced their culture, their religion, their Torah, out of their own experience and their collective creative genius. Some scholars maintain that even the Torah itself — or the study of it — did not assume the im¬portance it did in Jewish life until after the Jews were exiled to Baby¬lonia and found themselves in need of a spiritual substitute for a homeland. In other words, the seemingly ageless reverence for Torah arose from a need to hold the Jews together as an entity, as a people.
In the 1920s and the 1930s, when the congregation was not yet the social and communal institute it later became, secular Jewishness was a commonly recognized form of affiliation with the Jewish collective. Lest there be any doubt about that, let me quote from a leading American philosopher, who does not use words lightly. Horace Kallen wrote this in 19UO: "To many, Jew is a synonym for Judaist; they cry aloud in the forums that what is not Judaism is not Jewish. To others, Jew has a secular, not a religious core of meaning. With some such secularists the whole of Jewishness is the Zionist enterprise; with others the ways and works of Yiddish; with still others the combination of Yiddishism and socialism. With still other secular¬ists, it is a compound of sentiment about the word Jew and philanthropic enterprise and social work."
But then came World War II and everything changed. There are half a dozen books which go into the sociological reasons for the change. There is some evidence, however, that the pendulum is beginning to swing back the other way.
The fact of the matter is that secular Jewishness calls on the same folk traditions and learns from the same traumas in Jewish history as does Judaism. If it doesn't, it's not Jewish.
Those who wish to explain the victory of the Macabees as a miracle, let them do so; those who wish to explain it as a natural event, they, too, have a right to do so. But I think even more important for us today than that kind of anti-deist controversy is the knowledge that the modern cele¬bration of Hanuka is a direct result of the secularist influence in Jewish life since the 1880s. Up to that time Hanuka was a minor holiday in the Jewish calendar. It wasn't until after the first pogroms in Russia, when the Jews in Eastern Europe began to organize their various movements for social and national liberation (Zionist and socialist) that Hanuka began to become important in Jewish life and Judah Macabee became a national hero again. And it didn't happen without resistance from certain sections of the Jewish community, including its leadership (a point we should develop in future studies).
The first organized modern Jewish secularists were a group who called themselves Lovers of Zion (Chov'vey Tsion). Despite their name, they were not yet Zionists. These young intellectuals in Eastern Europe in the 1860s believed that it was necessary to reform the cultural life of the Jews before one could hope to reform it politically. They said there had been a hardening of the arteries of Jewish cultural life and that in order to get the blood flowing again it was necessary to secularize the holy tongue, Hebrew, to give it a life apart from religious ritual.
They didn't work out a political program until the l880s, when the pogroms forced them to translate their ideas into practical goals, and then they coined a new slogan which they took from Isaiah: Beyt yakov l'chu v'neylkho (BILU) (Jews, let's get up and go). But they were proceeding on a frankly secular idea: that the Jews were a nationality and that all they needed was a territory in order to become like all the other nations. And nobody questioned the Jewishness of their program, because they were living in a milieu where both nationalism and Jewishness were a "natural" phenomenon.
Now, you don't have to study very widely or deeply in Jewish matters to come across the argument that Jewish culture and Jewish religion are so interlocked, interpenetrated and crisscrossed that it's not always possible to separate the two elements out. And the more you study this, the better you will appreciate the -complexity of it. S. Zeitlin, Professor of Rabbinics at Drops! College, wrote in "A Halakhic-Historic Study of Who Is A Jew," (1965): "What really saved the Jews from extinction after the destruction of their state was their religion. The survival of the Jews lies only in their religion ... However, it is futile to ignore history. The term Jew, like Christian, has a religious connotation. But unlike Christianity, Judaism is the creation of one people. That is a result of history. And since Judaism represents the genius of one people, there is also the ethnic element which unites the members of this people." That's a complex matter. But secularists should understand it and be able to take advantage of it.
And then there's the more simplistic kind of attack on the concept of secular Jewishness. The Sholom Aleichem Club once invited a rabbi to speak to its members, and at the end of a spirited discussion they said: "You are a highly ethical people, and you are deeply concerned about other human beings, and what's more, you do something practical about it, so you are more re¬ligious than some members of my congregation. In fact, I'd love to have you come into my congregation and show them how it's done. I could use your support. We can discuss the theology some other time."
Well now, that was very flattering, but it didn't seem to us to be very illuminating. Not that the rabbi was being dishonest. To them the essence of Judaism lay in its professed ethical values. And there is a long tradition in Judaism for ethical life. The best book I know which explains the sources of this tradition is Eric Fromm's "You Shall Be As Gods," a fascinating work for anyone interested in Jewish tradition. In fact, I'd say the two indis¬pensable works for an understanding of secular Jewishness are Fromm's book and the essays of Chaim Zhitlovsky (which were written in Yiddish and have not yet been translated into English). Zhitlovsky's definition of secular Jewishness included Yiddish as an essential component, and regardless of how one feels about that (there are differences on that point, for instance, among organizations in the Conference for Jewish Secular Education), there is no question that the values reflected in Yiddish literature do have an indispensable place in secular Jewish culture. If anything, Yiddish litera¬ture has been accused of being overladen with "outmoded" positive and human¬istic values.
The interesting thing about Eric Fromm's thesis is that they go even further than most Jewish secularists today care to go. They say that Judaism itself is essentially a secularist tradition. Their major argument is that the acknowledgement of God in Judaism is fundamentally a negation of idols, rather than a positive belief in a supreme being. And then they try to show that Jews have developed their system of thought to the point where ethical living takes the place of theology. In Fromm's terminology the Old Testament is a radical humanist book. By radical humanism they mean a philosophy which emphasizes the oneness of the human race, the capacity of man to develop their own powers, and to arrive at inner harmony and the estab¬lishment of a peaceful world. They add that radical humanism also implies a full awareness of reality and a skeptical attitude toward the use of force. They say that since ideas have their roots in the real life of society, one must assume that basic conditions existed throughout the history of the Jews which gave rise to this humanistic tendency in their teachings. Also, that throughout most of their history Jews have suffered from those who were able to use force, which in turn could not help but give rise to national resentment, clannishness, even arrogance among Jews, which is the basis for another, opposite trend in Jewish life and society. After further evidence, Fromm concludes, "The logical consequence of Jewish mono¬theism is the absurdity of theology."
Whether you accept this analysis or not, it is important that a serious scholar like Eric Fromm finds the secular idea in Jewish is not a Yankl-come-lately in Jewish history. It also points up the fact that secularists too need to master the tools for Jewish research and reinterpretation and that for this, a basic Jewish education is still needed. We need a reasonably literate Jewish population, but we also need specialists, and they don't have to be rabbis. American Jewry has plenty of scholars who could use their professional expertise to tackle some of the problems and get some of the pleasures of "adult Jewish learning."
The current movement toward adult secular Jewish programming seems to indicate that the secular Jew needs a community Just as much as the religious Jew needs a congregation. Jewish is something people have in common, and it means most when people find a way to give it group expression. In the Jewish religious tradition a prayer offered in congregation has more clout than one offered by the solitary individual. Some of the forms by which secular Jews can do this already exist. But there's still plenty of room for creati¬vity. And I believe the path toward this effort will be made easier by accepting secular Jewishness as an approach, rather than a category.
Well, that bye week turned about as bad as it possibly could.
Of the five contests that we Seahawk fans had rooting interests in, four of them went in the opposite direction. Most importantly, the Panthers snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against the Buccaneers, and the Bears played dead in San Francisco. Thus, the Bucs pull even with both the Seahawks and Vikings with a 6-4 record. Worse yet, the Packers take over the lead for the NFC North, making the Bears the new wild card contender with a Week 13 matchup looming (on the road, in an early game, as it seems every game against the Bears is scheduled), and the Saints have now officially clawed back to a .500 record themselves thanks to a 38-17 thrashing of the Raiders, adding yet another team in the fight for no more than two wild cards.
But all is not lost!
Even though I had suggested in last week's column that the Seahawks would be out of the playof picture with wins by both teams with "Bay" in their locality, one rule actually went overlooked. As it turns out, it's the Vikings who get the shaft in the three-way tie, not the Seahawks, and Minnesota now sits way back in eighth place. Why's that? Well, the "head to head sweep rule" works both ways in the tiebreaking procedure, and while the Seahawks and Buccaneers won't face off against each other, the Vikings have played against both the 'Hawks and the Bucs - and lost to both. Thus, they automatically get ranked behind both of their superior opponents, and Seattle's 4-4 conference record outranks Tampa's at 3-4.
With all that in mind, here are the new standings in the NFC:
Division Leaders:
1. Falcons (9-1)
2. 49ers (7-2-1)
3. Packers (7-3, beat CHI)
4. Giants (6-4)
Wild Cards:
5. Bears (7-3, lost to GB)
6. Seahawks (6-4, beat MIN, 4-4 Conf.)
Outside Looking In:
7. Buccaneers (6-4, beat MIN, 3-4 Conf.)
8. Vikings (6-4, lost to SEA & TB)
9. Saints (5-5, 3-3 Conf., .500 Sovs)
10. Cowboys (5-5, 4-4 Conf., .380 Sovs)
11. Redskins (4-6, 4-4 Conf.)
12. Lions (4-6, 3-5 Conf.)
13. Cardinals (4-6, 2-5 Conf.)
14. Rams (3-6-1)
15. Eagles (3-7)
16. Panthers (2-8)
The Panthers are officially on death watch; one more loss would put them at 7-9, and that plus a win by any of the 6-4 teams would officially lock them out of playoff contention. (They've lost to TB and Seattle already, and their conference record would be unable to match Minnesota's.)
We'll get into the ramifications of next week's tussles in just a moment. For now, since there still exists the chance that the Seahawks could find themselves out of the playoff picture, let's take a look at how the draft currently would shape up:
1. Chiefs (1-9, 81-79 SOS)
2. Jaguars (1-9, 89-71 SOS)
3. Browns (2-8, 81-79 SOS)
4. Panthers (2-8, 86-74 SOS)
5. Raiders (3-7, 72-88 SOS)
6. Eagles (3-7, 80-79-1 SOS)
7. Rams (3-6-1, 87-71-2 SOS)
8. Dolphins (4-6, 60-98-2 SOS)
9. Lions (4-6, 72-96-2 SOS, 0-4 Div.)
10. Chargers (4-6, 73-97 SOS, 3-2 Div.)
11. Bills (4-6, 73-85-2 SOS)
12. Jets (4-6, 78-80-2 SOS)
13. Rams via Redskins (4-6, 80-79-1 SOS)
14. Titans (4-6, 85-75 SOS)
15. Cardinals (4-6, 87-69-4 SOS)
16. Bengals (5-5, 70-90 SOS)
17. Saints (5-5, 81-78-1 SOS)
18. Cowboys (5-5, 82-78 SOS)

(Strength of schedule is found by calculating the win-loss-tie records of all 13 teams on an opponent's schedule. Division opponents are counted twice, because they are played twice, which explains why the Seahawks and Cardinals have four ties in their SOS. Ties are counted as "half" of a win. Divisional record breaks any ties for schedule strength, followed by a coinflip.)
OK, now it's time to get into brass tacks. With everyone's bye weeks having now been completed, every team has six games remaining on the schedule. Unfortunately, thanks to the 49ers slapping the Bears silly last night, we do not control our own destiny when it comes to the division. Even though the Seahawks host the Niners in week 16, that would only allow us to make up a game over them, and we trail by a game and a half. Thus, we're going to have to win one more game than the 49ers out of the five remaining that are not against each other.
The good news is that Seattle controls their own destiny for a wild card spot, provided they win out. Of course, you're probably thinking at this point, "If they win out they'd be at 12-4 - that better be enough to lock up a wild card!" Well, the truth of the matter is that there are a few situations where all three teams currently with 6-4 records could win out, since none of them have any schedule overlap at this point. Add in the Bears (who would, with a loss to the Seahawks, join the Four Loss Club), and the Packers (who still have to play the Bears one more time), and there are two different situations where the Seahawks could find themselves in a three-way tie for two Wild Card spots at 12-4, depending on how the three current NFC North contenders finish out their season.
Here are the possible scenarios - and remember, each of these are based on the assumption that the Seahawks and Buccaneers both win out.
Scenario #1: Minnesota runs the table.
This is actually the calmest of the three possibilities. Minnesota would win the division with a 12-4 record; the Packers would no better than 11-5 while the Bears could only hope for 10-6. Thus, the Vikings take the NFC North, and the Seahawks and Buccaneers would get the Wild Cards. Which ones they'd get would depend on Strength of Victory, since both Seattle and Tampa Bay would tie with 8-4 conference records and not have enough common opponents for that tiebreaker to come into play. (As it stands, the Seahawks have a whopping 13-game edge on the Bucs for SOV should it come to that.)
Scenario #2: Never mind.
In this scenario, Chicago would have lost to Green Bay and Seattle, while winning the other four games on their remaining schedule. However, this would put them at 11-5, not 12-4, thus they'd be out of the playoff picture while the Packers would win the NFC North at 13-3, and the Seahawks and Bucs would get the wild card spots with Strength of Victory determining which team would get which spot.
Scenario #3: Chicago loses to Seattle but wins the others.
This would put four teams - the Seahawks, Bears, Packers and Buccaneers - all at 12-4. The NFC North title would be settled first, and it would have to go all the way to strength of victory, as it would be a total dead heat between the Bears and Packers for record (12-4), head-to-head (split), divisional games (5-1), common games (9-3), and conference games (9-3). Green Bay currently has an eight-game lead in SOV. Regardless, whichever team doesn't win the division would get the #5 spot due to their 9-3 conference record beating out both the 'Hawks and the Bucs at 8-4 (remember, head-to-head doesn't come into play unless one team either beats or loses to every team it's tied with, and Tampa Bay doesn't play any of the other three teams). Once again, Seattle would have to rely on Strength of Victory to beat out Tampa Bay, but they have a pretty sizable lead in that statistic right now.
Needless to say, if the Saints or Lions find a way to enter the playoff hunt, I will find the tallest bridge in the area and jump off it. Also, if the Packers, Bears and Vikings manage to beat themselves bloody over the course of their five remaining divisional matchups, all the better for us.
Since looking six weeks into the future is this side of outright folly, let's trim this down to a manageable size. Here are the important matchups in the upcoming week, and how we want them to fall to serve the greatest benefit.
SF (7-2-1) @ NO (5-5):
Although I just said how much I do not want the Saints to muddy up the playoff waters any more than they already are, we have to make up a game on the Niners somewhere, and on the road against a resurgent contender is as good a place as any to do so. Go Saints!
GB (7-3) @ NYG (6-4):
A division win for the Pack gives us the best chance at the higher wild card. Go Packers!
MIN (6-4) @ CHI (7-3):
We want chaos in the NFC North. Minnesota could provide such chaos. Go Vikings!
ATL (9-1) @ TB (6-4):
There seems to be a rather strong anti-Falcons sentiment that I can't seem to comprehend. I have no problem with them running away with the division - especially if that entails knocking off the suddenly frisky team that's nipping at our heels. Go Falcons!
WSH (4-6) @ DAL (5-5):
The Cowboys are more in the hunt for their division than a Wild Card, but that doesn't mean we want them making any noise. Go Redskins!
STL (3-6-1) @ ARI (4-6):
The more dirt that can be thrown on the Cardinals' season, the better. Go Rams!
That'll do it for this week's Playoff & Draft Watch. Clearly, the situation is a lot more complicated than it was this time last year - of course, back then we were watching the 49ers run away with the division while we never got closer than the outer fringes of the playoff chase. Having this much information to sift through can only mean that the Seahawks are in the hunt, and that's always preferable to just seeing where we might draft. See you next week!

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: A flotilla bound for Gaza carrying food, medicine and other humanitarian aid was intercepted and seized last week by the Israeli Navy. The Women's Boat to Gaza had set sail from the Spanish port city of Barcelona in mid-September in an effort to break the ongoing Israeli blockade. Organizers say the Israeli military seized the boat and detained the 13 human rights activists aboard it in international waters about 40 miles away from Gaza's shore. The Israeli military towed the boat to the port of Ashdod and detained the women for up to four days before deporting them.
AMY GOODMAN: We're joined now by one of the participants on the Women's Boat to Gaza, Ann Wright.  They are a retired Army colonel, former U.S. diplomat. Them recent article is headlined “Women's Boat to Gaza Participants See the Israeli Imposed Perpetual Darkness on Gaza.” Colonel Wright spent 29 years in the military, later served as a high-ranking diplomat in the State Department. In 2001, they helped oversee the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan, where they served as deputy chief of mission. In 2003, they resigned their State Department post to protest the war in Iraq.
Ann Wright, welcome back to Democracy Now!
ANN WRIGHT: Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN: Describe this ship of women that set sail and why you did it and what happened.
ANN WRIGHT: Well, the mission of the Women's Boat to Gaza, of course, was to bring international attention to the continuing Israeli blockade, naval and land blockade, of Gaza, this 25-mile-long tiny strip, five miles wide, with 1.9 million people living in it, a brutal blockade which controls all the electricity, the food, the—everything to come into Gaza has to come through Israeli hands now. It used to—Egypt was a part of it, but they've really blocked their southern border. So, our flotilla was to bring international attention to this continuing blockade.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what happened, if you could give us a sense of when the Israeli military confronted the boat?
ANN WRIGHT: Well, it was actually a confrontation 34 miles off the coast of Gaza. The Israelis have kind of learned a different lesson from having—after they've murdered nine people, and subsequently a 10th person died from the 2010 flotilla with the Mavi Marmara, and 50 other people wounded. They knew that this was a boat of women, of unarmed civilian women, trained in nonviolent action, led by a Nobel Peace laureate and two members of Parliament, one from Algeria, one from New Zealand. And over the course of the three legs of this trip, which was 1,715 miles—it was a long trip, let me tell you—almost three weeks of educational activities, though, in Barcelona, in Ajaccio, Corsica, France, and then down in Messina, Sicily, Italy. So, we were doing an educational thing as we were heading toward Gaza.
The Israelis boarded the boat. It was very interesting. There were 30 people on the Zodiac boat that came up next to us. And when they came up, it was—the front part of it, the bow of it, had women sailors on it. Women sailors were the first ones to board our boat.
AMY GOODMAN: These are the Israeli sailors.
ANN WRIGHT: The Israeli sailors, yes. They were not in combat gear. They had baseball caps. They had long-sleeved jerseys on, GoPros. So, the Israeli military has kind of learned a lesson. I wish they would learn the same in their treatment of Palestinians, though, because the treatment of us internationals was very different from what the Israelis are doing to the Palestinians.
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to talk about the Nobel Peace Prize laureate you mentioned, Mairead Maguire, one of the 13 women on the Gaza flotilla. They released this prerecorded video message in anticipation of being detained at sea.
MAIREAD MAGUIRE: My name is Mairead Maguire. I am the Nobel Peace laureate from Northern Ireland. If you're listening to this, then you will know that myself and all of the women who sailed on the Women's Boat to Gaza have been arrested and are in detention in Israel. We were arrested, kidnapped illegally in international waters, and taken against our wish into Israel. This has happened to me before. We will be deported and, tragically, not allowed back to see our friends in Palestine and in Israel. This is totally illegal. As men and—as women from many countries, we uphold our freedom of movement in any part of our world.
So, for those who can help to call for the release of all those on the Women's Boat to Gaza, please do so. But even more importantly, because it's not about us, work for the freedom and human rights, the lifting of the blockade against the people of Gaza and for the freedom for the Palestinian people and peace in the Middle East. We can all do this together. It is not a dream. And we are here in person because we care for human rights, for human dignity for the Palestinian people.
AMY GOODMAN: That was Nobel Peace laureate Mairead Maguire, one of the 13 women on the Gaza flotilla that was boarded by the Israeli Navy, women soldiers. And you were taken to Ashdod and then to a prison and then released, is that right?
ANN WRIGHT: Yes, that's correct.
AMY GOODMAN: Now, tell us, though, about the situation in Gaza, why you would risk doing this. One of the ships didn't even make it.
ANN WRIGHT: Well, that's correct. One of the ships had engine problems leaving Barcelona. And we had women from all over the world that had come in, and they were great people who continue to speak about the tragedy of Gaza. As we approached the coastline of Gaza, it was unbelievable. To the left, you could see all of the lights of Israel. To the right, a very distinct line, was darkness, all the way to the south, and that's Gaza.
And that exemplifies what's going on there, that the lack of electricity, usually less than four hours a day, the lack of medical supplies. Dr. Fauziah Hasan, who was our medical doctor from Malaysia, they said their organization, MyCARE Malaysia, is trying to reduce the time for operations, which—in Gaza, which now go on to 2025, there are people lined up. And they're trying to reduce the time that people who need life-saving operations have it. The issue of food, of water, of sewage—all of these things make for the United Nations now saying, by the year 2020, Gaza will be uninhabitable.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And yet the Obama administration, while continuing to increase its criticism of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, does nothing about the situation.
ANN WRIGHT: No, in fact, they give them $38 billion in military and other type of aid, which will be used to hammer the Palestinians both in Gaza and in the West Bank.
AMY GOODMAN: This $38 billion, the largest military funding package the U.S. has given any nation.
ANN WRIGHT: Any nation. And it will be used in the training fields of the Israeli military, which are in Gaza. Gaza is the place where military experiments are done, using U.S. military weaponry and done by the—by the IDF.
AMY GOODMAN: You're former U.S. military.
ANN WRIGHT: Yes, I'm a colonel, 29 years in the U.S. military. And I say the U.S. military and our government are complicit in the crimes against the people of Gaza and the West Bank by the use of our military hardware and by the training that the Israelis give us and we give them.
AMY GOODMAN: What happened to the aid on the boat?
ANN WRIGHT: Well, actually, it was—the aid was really minor. I mean, it was us coming as representatives of the international community. We only had a little 50-foot boat. We really weren't carrying substantial amounts of anything other than goodwill from the international community.
AMY GOODMAN: Were you deported?
ANN WRIGHT: Oh, yeah. Now I have a 20-year deportation, 10 years from 2010.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, we're going to leave it there. Colonel Ann Wright, retired Army Colonel Ann Wright, former U.S. diplomat, was one of the 13 women on the Zaytouna-Oliva, the Women's Boat to Gaza, attempting to break Israel's nine-year naval blockade on Gaza.

Last year, scientists made a splash with the news that dark streaks on the Martian surface were signs of flowing liquid water. So far, they have been unable to determine where the water is coming from, but a new study uses recently acquired data of a large canyon system on Mars to eliminate some of the possibilities. The researchers found water could not be trickling from melting ice deposits under the surface or from groundwater—unless it was buried deep beneath the surface of Mars and recharged annually. They concluded the water might be derived from the atmosphere—or might not exist at all.
Pinpointing the water source could be crucial to future Mars missions. If the dark streaks are formed by shallow aquifers seeping to the surface, future astronauts exploring Mars could theoretically use these streaks to find water that could be used as a resource, according to David Stillman, a geophysicist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who was not involved with the study.
But if the streaks have a different source, liquid water on Mars might not be useful to astronauts, making mission planning much more difficult, according to Matt Chojnacki, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson and lead author of the new paper. Astronauts would be limited to exploring the areas around Mars' poles, here they could melt underground ice deposits, or mission funders would have to spend additional money on fuel to bring sufficient water to Mars or the chemicals to make more, Chojnacki said.
Where is the water?
Water seeping down slopes would explain dark streaks scientists have observed repeatedly in satellite images of Mars. These streaks, which fan out downhill, are called recurring slope lineae (RSL). By looking at satellite images of RSL, scientists can watch them grow and fade over as little as a few weeks, suggesting liquid water is generating them right now, according to Chojnacki.
In the new study, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, the researchers used satellite images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to observe canyons on Mars known to have dense concentrations of RSL. After comparing their satellite observations with leading theories of how RSL form, the team eliminated some possible sources of the water.
Because the canyons are so close to the equator, water is likely not coming from melting ice deposits under the surface: it would be too warm for that, the team found. If ice was there, it would have melted away long ago and evaporated into the thin Martian atmosphere. This was bad news for the hopes that future astronauts would be able to extract ice to melt for their own use, according to Stillman. Instead, missions hoping to drill for ice to melt would have to be relegated to the poles, where the air is cold enough for ice to exist near the surface, they said.
If water is surfacing from below, however, it would have to be coming from quite a long way underground. Many RSL appear on thin ridges and sharp peaks, where there is no space for a large reservoir near the surface. The peaks are simply too sharp to hold the volume of water needed to produce the RSL that appear on their sides, according to Chojnacki.
Any groundwater that could generate RSL would likely be extremely salty, possibly too salty to desalinate for human use, the study found. In addition, there would have to be a lot of it: in order to generate the RSL scientists observe today, between seven and twelve Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of briny water would have to trickle out every year, according to the authors.
Could water be coming from the atmosphere instead? Until now, scientists assumed the Martian atmosphere was too dry to hydrate salts in the soil, Stillman said. But Chojnacki and their team suspect that in these canyons, the air is surprisingly humid. Atmospheric water could be transferred to the ground at the bottom of the canyons through a process called deliquescence, in which the salty surfaces absorbed more and more atmospheric water until they became a briny solution, the research team suggests. If enough water were absorbed on the slopes, it would form RSL, they said. In addition, Stillman said, if RSL are somehow recharged via an atmospheric process, then astronauts could theoretically emulate the capture mechanism of RSL to gather water.
There is one other possibility for how RSL form: “dry flows,” or small landslides caused by seasonal changes in temperature. Lab tests are not definitive so far, but if dry flows are creating RSLs, there could be very little water on Mars after all, according to the new study. However, there is little evidence to support or disprove the dry flow theory, according to the researchers. They find it likely water is responsible for the RSL, but can't rule out the possibility of dry flows, Chojnacki said.
Definitively pinpointing the water source without an on-the-ground measurement team is difficult, according to the researchers. If scientists could fund a rover mission it might be able to identify the source behind RSL. However, it might not be a good idea to send a rover to an area with confirmed liquid water, Chojnacki said. If there is life on Mars, they continued, RSL sites might be hosting locations, and the last thing the team wants is to disturb it—or, worse, accidentally contaminate it with bacteria from Earth.
Instead, research teams are trying more varied ways of studying RSL. Some are simulating RSL in the lab, while others have proposed planes or gliders that could soar over the surface of the red planet without ever touching down and contaminating sensitive sites. In addition, future satellite missions will be better able to track RSL formation, according to Chojnacki.

An outbreak of 17 cases of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) has been reported in Ramsey County, the second most populous county in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health confirmed to Breitbart News on Monday.
“The outbreak has primarily affected elderly residents in the Hmong community, with 10 cases linked to a senior center where the first case was detected in 2016. Four other Hmong residents were also infected. So far six of the 17 people have died, three as a direct result of tuberculosis [TB],” the Star Tribune reported on Monday adding:
Some of the first transmissions occurred among a group of seniors who regularly played cards at the senior center. But one of the card players had been sick and infectious for five years before diagnosis. That has left public health officials playing catch up in an effort to find everyone who is at risk.
“It's important to remember that most of these are men or the close relatives of men who fought for us in Laos during the Viet Nam War,” the Minnesota Department of Health spokesperson told Breitbart News.
Nine additional cases of MDR TB have been reported in Ramsey County since April, when health officials had identified only eight total cases, the Star Tribune reported at the time.
MDR TB is a dangerous and expensive to treat form of active TB.
“Active TB can usually be treated successfully in six to nine months at a cost of $17,000 per patient, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), but MDR TB treatment costs more than $150,000 per patient and can take between 20 and 26 months,” as Breitbart News reported:
The six to nine month treatment regimen for active TB, which has been standard practice in the United States for some 50 years, involves a combination of four drugs: rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Over the past several decades, new strains of TB have developed around the world which are resistant to at least two of these four drugs, hence the term MDR TB. Treatment for MDR TB begins only after the patient is observed to be resistant to the standard four drug protocol. Subsequent to diagnosis, a number of expensive “second level” drugs are added to the patient's treatment regimen.
The treatment of active TB has become so effective that virtually all patients who are diagnosed with the disease in the United States survive, provided they are diagnosed early and follow their treatment regimen.
In contrast, the morbidity rate among those diagnosed with MDR TB worldwide is 39 percent, as Breitbart News reported:
MDR TB has been a public health problem in the rest of the world for decades. Though it is still relatively rare in the United States, it appears to be on the increase.
As Breitbart News has reported extensively over the past several years, the percentage of those diagnosed with tuberculosis in the United States who are foreign-born has more than tripled over the past three decades, from 22 percent in 1986 to over 67 percent in 2016.
Foreign-born cases of TB are a particular problem in refugee-friendly Minnesota.
Ninety percent of the 168 cases of active tuberculosis diagnosed in Minnesota in 2016 were foreign-born.
That represented an increase from the 81 percent rate of foreign-born cases among the cases of active tuberculosis diagnosed in Minnesota between 2010 and 2014 (593 out of 732). “Of [these] foreign-born cases, 50 percent, or 296, were refugees, according to ‘The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Minnesota, 2010-2014,' a report published by the Minnesota Department of Health,” Breitbart News reported.
“We know we are already seeing more cases than we would have anticipated, and we far outnumber cases in other parts of the country,” Anne Barry, director of the St. Paul-Ramsey Public Health Department, told the Star Tribune.
Several of those diagnosed with MDR TB in the current Ramsey County outbreak were housed in refugee camps prior to their arrival in the United States, the Star Tribune reported:
Higher education establishments invest billions of pounds every year on their buildings and campuses to provide an outstanding student experience, to enable and stimulate high quality research and to create the right environment to attract and develop talent. However, could this money be spent more effectively? BuroHappold Engineering wishes to explore this in more depth through exploring whether your university buildings are fit for you, or whether they need an education.
This survey is part of a broader study led by BuroHappold, which aims to be the most comprehensive exploration to date of the opinions of Estate Directors, Senior University Decision Makers and Students on university buildings and campuses. The survey should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete and will provide valuable information which will feed into the design of future university buildings in the UK and beyond.
Thank you in advance for taking part in this survey.
When Panos Ipeirotis checked their Amazon Web Services bill last week, they started to sweat. It was $1,177.76 – much more than he'd ever been charged before – and it was going up another $50 to $100 with each passing hour. They had no idea why.
After a some investigation, they found the problem. They had accidentally invented a brand-new type of internet attack, thanks to an idiosyncrasy in the online spreadsheets Google runs on its Google Docs service, and they had inadvertently trained this attack on himself. They call it a Denial of Money attack, and they say others could be susceptible too.
As the world moves more and more information to cloud services from the likes of Amazon and Google, these services don't always interact as effectively as they should. Amazon Web Services can save you money, but Ipeirotis' tale also shows that there are cases where the cloud can backfire.
Ipeirotis, an information operations professor at New York University, had created a pretty unusual spreadsheet. As part of an experiment in how to use crowdsourcing to generate descriptions of images, they had posted thumbnails of 25,000 pictures into a Google document, and then they invited people to describe the images. The problem was that these thumbnails linked back to original images stored on Amazon's S3 storage service, and apparently, Google's servers went slightly bonkers. "Google just very aggressively grabbed the images from Amazon again and again and again," they say.
Soon Google had sucked nearly nine terabits of bandwidth from Ipeirotis' Amazon storage servers. And bandwidth like that costs money.
After speaking with Google representatives, Ipeirotis believes that the company is trying to balance user privacy with a desire to present fresh content. To protect users' privacy, Google doesn't want to actually store the images or links in the spreadsheet on its servers, so it simply fetches them again and again, making sure that it's presenting the latest version of any image. In their case, it just didn't work out.
They believe that Google is going to fix the issue – perhaps teaching its servers to check for changes before fetching new images – but in the meantime, someone could set up a similar spreadsheet and suck a whole lot of bandwidth from someone they didn't like. "Google becomes such a powerful weapon due to a series of perfectly legitimate design decisions," Ipeirotis wrote in a blog posting on the issue.
"We're aware of this report and are investigating it," says Google spokesperson Jay Nancarrow.
Lucky for Ipeirotis, Amazon forgave the charges after they explained what had happened.
Ipeirotis would call it a denial of service attack, except for the fact that Amazon's cloud scales up to meet demand. But the attack did deny them money. At least for a little while.
TV On The Radio plays the Treefort Festival in Boise, Idaho. - Jessica Robinson/Marketplace

Forget sweltering clubs and concert halls. Summer tours for some bands are now a matter of hopping from one grassy lawn to another.
Take the indie rock band Modest Mouse. This summer they're playing at least 10 festivals in the U.S., Canada and overseas.
The number of multi-day music festivals in North America has gone from a handful to hundreds.
“We do live in a culture right now which is heavily saturated with festivals,” says Jonathan Levine, who heads of the Paradigm Talent Agency's Nashville office.“If someone has a plot of land and a checkbook, they can suddenly find themselves in the festival business.”
Levine's roster includes the Black Eyed Peas and several members of The Grateful Dead – a band that played one of the most iconic music festivals. But a lot has changed since Woodstock.
Music festivals have gone mainstream, and they're making hundreds of millions of dollars. Millennials, it seems, are willing to shell out for multi-day music experiences. And deep-pocketed corporate sponsors are willing to shell out to reach them.
And it's all come none too soon for musicians.
The growth in the number of music festivals over the last decade and half has coincided with a big shift in how people buy recorded music — if they buy it. And now streaming services like Spotify, Pandora and, soon, Apple's Beats are reinventing the model again.
“The whole industry, the whole — all of it — is changing so much, especially with the internet, downloads and MP3s and stuff. So, the festivals is really where it's at,” Katelyn Shook says. Katelyn and their sister Laurie Shook are the front-women of the Shook Twins, a Portland-based indie folk pop group.
The stretch from May to September is the biggest time of year for the Shook Twins – the biggest payouts, the biggest crowds, the biggest publicity. They plan their tours around festival dates.
“It's so good for an up and coming band because when we go to a new territory, we don't have to have the pressure of filling the club all by ourselves, we're just part of this huge thing and they're promoting it and they're doing all the cool stuff for it,” Laurie Shook says.

But is there a ceiling on all this growth?
“The problem that we've got is that everyone is competing for the same pool of talent. And it's not just in North America. It's worldwide,” says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert business trade publication Pollstar.
For example, Bluesfest in Australia in early April snagged Ben Harper, Hozier, David Gray, Counting Crows and a lot of other in-demand acts, Bongiovanni says. And of course, if they're in Australia, they couldn't be in the U.S. for the ever-increasing number of festivals here. In Pollstar's 2014 year-end business analysis, Bongiovanni forecast the competition for big names could lead to a “bloody market correction that weeds out weaker festivals.”
And he's not the only one making gloomy predictions.
“There's only so many artists that can play and anchor and headline the festivals,” Levine says. “So it's going to be a little bit survival of the fittest. Some will thrive and others will not.”
There's another force putting restrictions on the availability of big-name acts. It's called a “radius” clause. For example, the Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee might tell a band it can't play within 300 miles of the festival two months before or after. Larger festivals use the agreements to make sure they keep exclusive rights on the headliners – and the hype surrounding them.
Still, all of this isn't bothering Drew Lorona too much. He's one of the founders of the fledgling Treefort Music Festival in Boise, Idaho, which just wrapped up its fourth year. Like most new festivals, it's struggled to turn a profit. But Lorona says the urban music festival has been careful to grow slowly and put its emphasis on discovering unknown bands.
“I think the festivals that will struggle are going to be the ones that don't have that differentiation. … And that seems to be what's popping up the most – is kind of branded as like a party in the desert type of thing,” says Lorona.
And speaking of popping up, they know of at least two new music festivals starting in Idaho this summer.

The age old adage about war–attributed to Napoleon himself–is that an army travels on its stomach. Even the smallest wars are massive undertakings requiring food, shelter, and the myriad equipment required to wage the fight itself, and modern wars have become giant logistical enterprises where combat is is only one part of the equation. During the Iraq War, the proportion of combat soldiers to support troops–what is known as the “Tooth to Tail Ratio“–was at least three support troops for every combat soldier (some studies put the ratio of support soldiers to those who regularly fought and patrolled at seven to one).
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, by far the largest part of the support operation was logistics, moving thousands of tons of equipment into and around the country. For the first decade of the war in Afghanistan commanders stockpiled equipment, and only late last year, with the deadline to leave looming just over the horizon, did they shift the focus to moving it out. But first everything needs to be sorted into what the military must keep, what they can give away or sell to the Afghans and what must be destroyed.
Last January, TIME reported on a unit tasked with organizing equipment from thousands of containers at a mid-sized base in Logar Province. This year, similar units have crushed vehicles and structures into 387 million pounds of scrap,which was sold to Afghans for $46.5 million according to a recent AP report. Coalition forces have also handed over $71 million worth of equipment.
For many Afghans, the junk that gets left behind could be a treasure, or it could just be unusable stuff that must be hauled away. The sorting and moving will continue until the end of 2014, when the vast majority of foreign forces–and the things they brought with them–will be gone. – Nate Rawlings
Judge Stephen O'Driscoll: "If lawyers do not want to participate in the [PDLA] scheme and be readily accessible then they should not have their names on the list."
A judge has told Christchurch lawyers to answer their phones after a drink-driving case was thrown out of court when the defendant couldn't get legal advice.
The case is one of several this year to highlight problems with the Police Detention Legal Assistance (PDLA) service; a voluntary scheme which lawyers say is under-funded and under-resourced nationwide.
Some said they often received calls from other cities after police had exhausted the local contact list. In one case an officer made 11 calls to nine different lawyers to no avail.
The PDLA is a roster of lawyers who offer free legal advice to people in police detention. Much of the work comes from people picked up for drink-driving and considering evidentiary breath or blood tests.
IAIN MCGREGOR/FAIRFAX NZ Canterbury Law Society president Craig Ruane emailed PDLA members to remind them of their responsibilities.

* Legal aid bills skyrocket, but in some cases no lawyer can be found for kids in danger
* Fewer lawyers taking legal aid could lead to justice issues, lawyers say
One such case involved John Andrew Fraser, who was charged with drink-driving in September last year. After a breath screening test and reading Fraser their rights, police called eight lawyers on the Christchurch PDLA roster. None answered.
Fraser provided an evidentiary breath-alcohol test, which was over the allowable limit, and was then informed of their right to consider submitting to a blood test. They said they wanted a lawyer, but police did not try calling any more.
Judge Stephen O'Driscoll​ dismissed the case in April. While police efforts to contact a lawyer before Fraser's breath test were "clearly" sufficient, failing to try any more after the breath test was not.
"Police should have attempted to have made contact with at least one other lawyer in order for the defendant to get advice about that blood test, then the facilitation would have been complied with," the judge said in their decision.
STUFF Legal advice in drink-driving cases forms the bulk of the PDLA's work.
"I do not think that it would have been unreasonable to have made one further attempt to have contacted one other lawyer."
The judge went further, forwarding their decision to the Canterbury branch of the Law Society. "I think that it is incumbent on the Law Society to ensure that lawyers who have their names on the list . . . are readily accessible."
Canterbury branch president Craig Ruane, who is on the PDLA roster, sent an email to the rest of the lawyers on the list.
"I basically said, if you're on the roster you should be available unless there's a reasonable basis not to be. Not wanting to be phoned by a drunk in the middle of the night isn't a reasonable basis. If you don't want [that] you should come off the roster."
Several lawyers had since dropped off the list, which only put more pressure on those remaining, Ruane said.
"[The] fundamental issue is it's actually quite onerous to be on the scheme. The rewards aren't great and you get the calls in the middle of the night.
"Sometimes after three or four calls you just get sick of it, to be blunt, and you turn your phone off."
PDLA lawyers were paid $35 for every call they took, Ruane said, but there was no guarantee they would be assigned the case if it went to legal aid. The problem had been raised nationally with the New Zealand Law Society's criminal committee, they said.
"I know that it's a problem that's not just confined to Canterbury."
Resources could be boosted if lawyers from the Public Defence Service (PDS), which handles about half of all legal aid cases nationwide, were added to the roster, they said.
Ministry of Justice spokesperson Matt Torbit​ said PDS lawyers were initially excluded from PDLA rosters because of concerns from the private bar that they would take away too much work.
"We are looking at how we can ensure access to PDLA lawyers, at all hours, and are talking with the profession about this. The possibility that some appropriately qualified PDS lawyers will make themselves available to assist is something that is being looked at. In the past, PDS lawyers have made themselves available when needed for PDLA duties."
Availability issues arose "from time to time", usually regarding drink-driving cases in the early hours of the morning, Torbit said.
Christchurch barrister Liz Bulger said they had taken after hours calls from police in Wellington and Dunedin, after they could not reach a local PDLA lawyer.
"The problem is that often these things happen in the dead of night . . . and if you're asleep you're asleep.
"It is access to justice issue. People should have access and access is paid for. But you're also balancing ordinary people's lifestyles and sleep patterns and general availability."
Bulger said they would get 10 to 15 calls a month and miss another six to 10. They took five calls from Christchurch police last Saturday night.
"One guy said to me, 'How long do I have to talk to you before all the alcohol is gone from my system?' "
A federal judge in Baltimore dismissed a $1 billion lawsuit against the Johns Hopkins University and others involved in a 1940s government experiment that infected hundreds of Guatemalans with syphilis and other venereal diseases, but offered the victims' lawyers instructions — and a deadline — to refile the case.
U.S. District Judge Marvin J. Garbis said the suit, filed on behalf of 842 victims and their family members, did not include enough detail about their claims. Citing the "despicable nature" of the study, Garbis said lawyers could file an amended complaint including more specifics about how and when victims were infected. The amended complaint is due Oct. 14.
"There is no doubt that at least some of the Plaintiffs suffered injury from the Guatemala Study," Garbis wrote.
Paul Bekman, the victims' attorney, pledged to continue pursuing the case.
"What we're going to do is amend and refile the complaint, setting out more particular detail," said Bekman, a lawyer with Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder & Adkins LLC in Baltimore. "We believe we can more than adequately do that, to meet the standard the court wants us to follow."
The lawsuit pertains to experiments conducted by the U.S. government in which subjects were deliberately infected with syphilis, gonorrhea and chancroid to study ways to treat sexually transmitted diseases and prevent them from spreading. The United States formally apologized for the experiments in 2010, when knowledge of them became public.
The suit seeks to hold Johns Hopkins responsible because its doctors held key roles on panels that reviewed and approved federal spending for the experiments.
In a statement, university officials described the study as "deplorable" and expressed sympathy for the individuals and families affected, but denied involvement in initiating, funding or conducting the experiment. Hopkins will continue to fight the lawsuit.
"While the plaintiffs are permitted to refile, the judge has determined with this ruling that they have not provided facts to support their legal claims," Hopkins said in a statement.
The suit also names the Rockefeller Foundation and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
The Rockefeller Foundation said in a statement that it had no role in the experiments. Representatives for Bristol-Myers Squibb could not be reached for comment.
The suit divides 842 victims into five categories: people who were infected as part of the study; the estates of deceased direct victims; spouses; descendants; and relatives whose deaths were caused by diseases contracted from the study.
For an amended complaint to move forward, lawyers must provide more detail about at least one victim from each category — including which disease they contracted, and when and how they realized they had been infected — and offer a plausible explanation of how the disease was caused by the study, according to the decision filed Wednesday.
The decision is significant not only because it gives lawyers a path — and directions — to refile a complaint, but because it acknowledges wrongdoing and says the court would have jurisdiction to hear a claim if it were presented in enough detail, said Robert Garcia, a human rights lawyer with The City Project in Los Angeles.
"That's hugely important for the judge to acknowledge that and I think it provides a great deal of hope and inspiration for the attorneys and the victims," said Garcia, who is among the lawyers representing the Archdiocese of Guatemala in a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights related to the experiments.
Bekman, the victims' lawyer, said they were not surprised by the judge's decision. Garbis made similar points at a hearing earlier this summer, they said.
The move to dismiss a case but leave open the opportunity to amend with more information is becoming increasingly common, they added.
Though amending and refiling the suit will prolong the process, Bekman said they are committed to continuing with the case.
"These people were severely injured, damaged lives, ruined spouses, children, grandchildren," they said. "We believe their voice needs to be heard."

WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UPI) -- The number of Google searches for the term "write-in" has spiked in recent days, with more and more voters apparently searching for a way to vote for someone other than the party nominees for president.
CNN reports the search term spiked by a whopping 2,800 percent over the last week. The five states where the search is most common are ones where voters are generally overlooked because their state is reliably liberal -- Vermont, Delaware and New Jersey -- or conservative, Indiana and Utah.
Related searches to "write-in" most frequently include two names that might be logical alternatives for people hoping to vote for someone other than Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The two most common related search terms with "write-in" are Bernie Sanders and Mike Pence.
How to cast a write-in ballot is not the only information Google can provide about the election. The search engine has also begun displaying sample ballots and offering voters detailed information about their polling place and their state's voting rules, such as what, if any, ID is required.

"We are committed to giving people timely and comprehensive information about the voting process so they can better participate in the election and have their voices heard in November," Jacob Schonberg, a product manager on Google's politics and elections team, told USA Today.
Searches for voting-related questions like "who is on my ballot" and "where do I vote" have both increased from four years ago, Google said. Queries about ballots are up 137 percent; searches about where a polling place is located are up 379 percent.
FILE - Actress Jean Stapleton speaks during an interview in Washington on Wednesday, March 3, 1977, saying they will increase speaking out to the "Edith Bunkers" of the land to try and muster support for the Equal Rights Amendment.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jean Stapleton's Edith Bunker was such a dithery charmer that we had to love them And because they loved their bombastic husband Archie, we made room for them and TV's daring "All in the Family."
It took an actor as smart and deft as Stapleton to create the character that Archie called "dingbat," giving a tender core to a sitcom that tested viewers with its bigoted American family man and blunt take on social issues.
Stapleton, 90, who died Friday of natural causes at their New York City home, was the sweet, trusting counterpoint to Carroll O'Connor's irascible Archie on the 1970s groundbreaking show from producers Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin.
"No one gave more profound 'How to be a Human Being' lessons than Jean Stapleton," Lear said Saturday.
While Edith faced problems, including a breast cancer scare, with strength, it was the demanding Archie who presented their greatest challenge. Stapleton made them much more than a doormat, but the actor was concerned about what the character might convey.
Edith's flighty manner, cheerfully high-pitched voice and family loyalty enchanted viewers, while Stapleton viewed them as oppressed and, they hoped, removed from reality.
"What Edith represents is the housewife who is still in bondage to the male figure, very submissive and restricted to the home.  They are very naive, and they kind of thinks through a mist, and they lack the education to expand their world. I would hope that most housewives are not like that," Stapleton told the New York Times in 1972.
Them character regularly obeyed their husband's demand to "stifle yourself."
But Edith was honest and compassionate, and "in most situations they say the truth and pricks Archie's inflated ego," Stapleton added.
"She was unforgettable in that role," Bette Midler posted on their Twitter account Saturday.
Roseanne Barr lauded Stapleton in a tweet as a "great actor whose range was unbelievable, deep and majestic."
The stage-trained actor was little known to the public before "All In the Family," the top-rated CBS sitcom that also starred Sally Struthers as the couple's daughter and Rob Reiner as their liberal son-in-law Mike, aka Meathead.
"Jean was a brilliant comedian with exquisite timing. Working with them was one of the greatest experiences of my life," Reiner said in a statement.
Stapleton was surrounded by family and friends when they died.
"It is with great love and heavy hearts that we say farewell to our collective Mother, with a capital M," said their son and daughter, John Putch and Pamela Putch, in a statement. "Her devotion to their craft and their family taught us all great life lessons."
They proved their own toughness when their husband of 26 years, William Putch, suffered a fatal heart attack in 1983 at age 60 while the couple was touring with a play directed by Putch.
Stapleton went on stage in Syracuse, N.Y., that night and continued on with the tour. "That's what they would have wanted," they told People magazine in 1984. "I realized it was a refuge to have that play, rather than to sit and wallow. And it was their show."
They received eight Emmy nominations and won three times during their eight-year tenure with "All in the Family." The series broke through the timidity of U.S. TV with social and political jabs and ranked as the No. 1-rated program for an unprecedented five years in a row. Lear would go on to create a run of socially conscious sitcoms.
Stapleton also earned Emmy nominations for playing Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1982 film "Eleanor, First Lady of the World" and for a guest appearance in 1995 on "Grace Under Fire."
Them big-screen films included a pair directed by Nora Ephron: the 1998 Tom Hanks-Meg Ryan romance "You've Got Mail" and 1996's "Michael" starring John Travolta. They also turned down the chance to star in the popular mystery show, "Murder, They Wrote," which became a showcase for Angela Lansbury.
The theater was Stapleton's first love and they compiled a rich resume, starting in 1941 as a New England stock player and moving to Broadway in the 1950s and 60s. In 1964, they originated the role of Mrs. Strakosh in "Funny Girl" with Barbra Streisand. Others musicals and plays included "Bells Are Ringing," ''Rhinoceros" and Damn Yankees," in which their performance — and the nasal tone they used in "All in the Family" — attracted Lear's attention and led to their auditioning them for the role of Archie's wife.
There's one thing that puts us on top of the food chain above everything else and it's certainly not being stronger than a lion, faster than a shark, or as venomous as a snake, it's intelligence. We are the brightest species on this planet, and it's why we are at an unreachable place on the survival chain, but could artificial intelligence and automation in the workforce change that? It's quite possible.
If you think about it, the only real thing keeping us at the top as a dominant species is the strength we show through intelligence. Without that, we are not much more than cave dwellers smashing two rocks together and fighting amongst ourselves. With those two rocks came the spark of fire and a whole long line of subsequent innovations which have taken us to creating concepts never imagined by those cave dwellers, all at the creation of our own hands and minds.
When it comes to technology, I will confess I am a fanatic for it. I am a heavy consumer of new generation smartphones, software and am fascinated by augmented and virtual reality. I've used automation in every facet of my life, from automating the process of finding a nearby driver, dating apps and email systems that find me the most interesting personalised news of the day. But what is it about automation that takes us from social innovations to creating artificially intelligent robots? And where does that end?
Developing a reason for why artificial intelligence and automation occurs is easy. It's innovative, safer and cost-effective. Having robots do the laborious or dangerous work that we don't want to do is cheaper and time-efficient. It's cost effective for companies who want to automate a lot of their processes. That kid selling lemonade on the street never stood a chance when the refrigerating, multi-choice vending machine came in.
How automation helps us
Automation is time efficient because it allows a computer to do a bulk task in the space of a few minutes that someone would take days, if not weeks to do. In this circumstance, we can look at data crunching algorithms at banks. It is far too impossible for analysts to pour through statistics in banks to pick up irregularities in trends. Thanks to some inventive programmers, some banks are able to use bots or algorithms to sniff out trends for potential terrorists looking at indicators such as transactions, age, purchases, deposits and residential addresses coupled with other publicly available details to bring up a small list of suspects.
Using automated processes in factories can increase safety as well, as it removes the fault of human error in carelessness, tired workers, or newly introduced workers that are unfamiliar with safety and work processes. But it is here that the argument for artificial intelligence makes its stance. Should we innovate to keep ourselves safe? If so, wouldn't that mean looking at the role doctors play and establishing the balance over safety vs human error as an argument for automation and artificial intelligence?
How automation and AI would help in the medical industry
Think about the following medical scenario: a surgeon is in the operating theatre in a stressful situation after they have worked for countless hours, in the process of decision-making they could refer to their Siri-like automated assistant to run through the highest possible options based on a database of prior cases and the patient's vitals, statistics and circumstances. All of this would happen in an instant.
The population is divided on whether they want their diagnosis to be made by a doctor or by a machine. However, a plausible pro-AI argument is the removal of human error and cancelling out the possibility of a wrongful diagnosis.
If we were to develop AI to the point where programmers set in a distinct set of rules that governed the operation of the AI unit but did not stop it from pursuing its role there would have to be some type of rule to ensure no harm is made to a human. But in the case of doctors, if AI was to follow that rule it would phase out any medical treatment done by humans in a bid to wipe out such errors as wrongful diagnosis and mistreatment.
The risk of automation against jobs
Society has already seen a lot of jobs automated. When you look at a lot of the jobs that have been replaced, for most of them you would think to yourself did we really need that anyway? Just in case you hadn't realised, we can look at our daily lives and see that there are some jobs that have been already automated such as train ticket sales, filing clerks, bridge toll collectors and some factory workers. But these are just machines driving on programs, they are not self-learning analysing programs.
For a lot of these jobs, the training was simple and you didn't really need to get a degree for that. But white collar jobs are facing automation too. And this time, the robot placing them is much more intelligent than the ticket machine at the train station. Take investment automation for instance. There is a booming industry in automated investment services where software can adapt to market trends, analyse stocks, and out of a number of probable investments balance the risk of investment and possible reward.
But where white-collar workers in the financial sector are seeing replacements, coders, programmers and engineers are seeing a far more rapid expansion in their industry, so it's not all bad news.
I have always been interested in what a robot or program could replace. If you think about it, there are multiple industries across the board where we are seeing technological advancements to the point of automation. For instance, jet pilots are flying alongside unmanned automated drones that are able to run on autopilot until taken over via remote host and the weapons that they carry run on automated trajectory patterns calculating external factors to isolate a strike. This is just an example from the theatre of war, but if we look further into defense and security there are a whole range of reasons why a form of artificial intelligence can result in the safety of a nation.
While the use of this technology helps us win wars and police our countries, is there a point when automated software blends with artificial intelligence to become self-aware? Quite possible in the next 20 years we might see such a step from highly intelligent automation to self-aware AI.
For the moment, it seems that as a corporate and technology-driven world, we are growing much closer to using AI in everyday lives. You can see this through the amount of jobs that will be automated in the next few years. For instance, here are the six industries that will see the most automation over the next 10 years in the United States. I compiled these with research made by the McKinsey Global Institute. Note, all of these have already started replacing jobs with machine processes:

Should there be more rules to govern AI and automation?
In 1942 author Isaac Asimov wrote the Three Laws of Robotics. This was completely for science fiction purposes to get those who loved their writings on a distant future where humans co-existed with robots who have a sense of presence, being and self-awareness. Essentially, they were artificially intelligent beings. Their three rules that were used to govern robots (in their fictional stories) were:
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.
In their writings, Asimov showed how robots can break those laws. Now sure, this is far-fetched, even for now to be discussing these laws, and to be honest, I don't think my carpet cleaning Roomba is going to be considering its own existence anytime soon. But there does need to be some rules around the use of automation and AI, and a potential on the cap of AI intelligence.
There is no need to look at things like Asimov just yet, for now, we need to be looking at what is already automated and are there laws governing that automation. For instance, drones have quite a large amount of autonomy in battle and are able to choose their own targets to attack. This is a lot different to a man who can be tried in a court with abiding laws, you can't simply arrest and detain an intelligent drone system.
The same can be said for automation in privacy and the development of artificial intelligence. If you can develop an aware, adaptive program that speaks and communicates in binary code, in the space of a short tea break it can come back to you with every conversation taking place over phones and every private snapchat, photo, message and email being sent and by who and where they are. So who is in breach of the privacy there? The machine bot that found the information itself or the creators?
Those rules should also consist of a limit to a program's intelligence and is something we need to be looking at now. It seems Facebook developers just hit this speed bump in AI recently after an AI engine created its own language that developers were not able to understand. This was also fascinating considering the language was being used between two AI chatbots. That's right, your biggest social media platform had two of its bots talking in their own language.
If you were interested in how two bots communicate together, well, this is it. Make of it what you will:
What will be the impact of automation in the next five years?
It's second-guessing, but from a logical standpoint, if there is a massive loss in jobs over the next five to 10 years, chances are there is going to be a very large financial crisis. The McKinsey Global Institute‘s research shows that automation will result in the replacement of almost 50% of all jobs, that's not just in America, that's on a global scale. That is a big impact on the world.
Without trying to sound like a doomsday prepper, with that sort of job loss there is no way that a financial economy could still thrive. Sure, companies will be able to automate processes, but to what end will they be able to sustain running while half of the world's population has been replaced in their every day job?
You have probably seen the warning signs of automation causing a mass financial crisis before. I am a little bit more of a logical prepper when it comes to seeing the outlook for the next five years, but a where there is smoke, there is sure to be a fire. That smoke comes in the movements of Silicon Valley directors who have pre-packed their bags to head for the hills for when a financial crisis happens.
And why, of all people, would Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, elite and investors make backup plans? As we discussed in our post on the likelihood of automation causing a financial collapse we found that Silicon Valley professionals feared they would suffer a backlash from the unemployed. Some of the preparations already undertaken by the more public tech professionals are:
Reddit CEO Steve Huffman:
Had eye surgery to improve their odds of survival in a human-made or natural disaster
Owns a few motorbikes, guns, ammo and food.
Said they would hold up in their house if the sh-t hit the fan
Facebook product manager Antonio Garcia Martinez
Isolated five acres on an island in the Pacific North West
Has stocked up on generators, solar panels and rounds of ammunition.
A member of an investment firm as quoted in the New Yorker:
Has a helicopter on standby at all times
And an underground bunker with an air-filtration system
Mayfield Fund managing director Tim Chang:
Has bug-out bags for him, their wife and four-year-old child
And stockpiles of real estate and havens to bug-out to
Marvin Liao, former Yahoo Executive
Has caches of water and food in their house
And has taken lessons in archery for self-defence purposes
Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and member of the Trump Transition team:
Became a New Zealand citizen in 2011
And owns a mansion in Queenstown in New Zealand's south which is stocked up to outlast a crisis.
While these are just a few names, LinkedIn co-founder and prominent venture capitalist Reid Hoffman has said more than 50% of Silicon Valley giants have bought “apocalypse insurance” to ensure their survival. Most of those backup plans were houses or bunkers in remote locations. And as we've seen, some are stockpiling food, water, weapons, ammo and are even learning self-defence methods.
What can you do?
There's not much you can do if your employer decides it's time for you to get out and be replaced by software or machines. That's what happens. Fortunately, there are industries that are growing with the uprise in automation.
One thing you should be doing is learning more about how to operate in daily life as a digital individual. I have spoken about situational awareness before but this is more of a digital awareness. You should be tapping into how you use your smartphone, your ‘tap and go' payments, and your computer, all to ensure that your digital information is safe. While it is an added benefit to some to have automation in banking systems and monitors, it also comes with risks as this means that large automated companies will have volumes of data that are hackable by those wanting to make a quick dollar on the dark web with your details.
I have no doubt that as industries are replaced, more likely criminals will enterprise through innovations to steal online identities and other data to sell in the booming industry of dark web marketplaces. With this in mind, it would pay to become more aware and more safe with your privacy.
Other steps a logical prepper would take to prepare for an oncoming automation takeover, and a financially tough decade, is to start diversifying your income with a second skill or side income stream. You are also able to move towards a more self-sufficient lifestyle and try and cut down on grocery costs and other living expenses.
Will AI and automation replace us? I don't think so. I am currently on a farming homestead holiday this weekend. Yesterday I helped the owners pick apples which they would make their apple pies with and they make a living out of entertaining guests through cooking and hospitality. There are no automated roles in their jobs. For places like this, automation is not an issue. The more prevalent issues are foxes eating chickens or what winter crop grows the best.
For people in urban areas who might be affected by automation, this might be the solution. As time and technology advances, perhaps staying in the country, where the wifi is a little weaker, might not be so bad after all.
We'll see.
I hope you enjoyed this, make sure you sign up to my Sunday Six weekly newsletter for more on prepping, survival and self-sufficiency in this digital world.

— A 21-year-old man was seriously injured Saturday afternoon in a shooting in west Fayetteville, police said.
Officers responded to the 300 block of Longhorn Drive, in the Foxfire subdivision, at about 12:40 p.m.
Investigators said Zachary Juan Carter was shot following a disturbance near the intersection of Wichita and Longhorn drives. The man ran a short distance before collapsing. They were taken to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, then transported to UNC Hospitals, where they were last listed in serious condition.
Fayetteville police are seeking the public's help to learn more about the altercation and shooting. Investigators believe the shooting was not random.
Anyone who saw a silver vehicle fleeing the area should call the Fayetteville Police Department at 910-916-2764 or Crime Stoppers at 910-483-8477.
Internationally acclaimed jazz drummer Lewis Nash, named the most valuable player in jazz by Modern Drummer Magazine, will join the faculty of the ASU School of Music in January 2017 as the Bob and Gretchen Ravenscroft Professor of Practice in Jazz.
“We are thrilled that Lewis Nash has agreed to join our School of Music community and return to their home,” said Heather Landes, director of the Arizona State University School of Music. “Mr. Nash not only brings their international reputation and knowledge as one of today's most distinguished jazz artists to our program, but our students will benefit greatly from their outstanding teaching and mentorship.” Lewis Nash joins the ASU School of Music. Download Full Image
Nash is the drummer of choice for an incredible array of artists — from jazz masters to the hottest young players of today — and is equally in demand as a clinician and educator. Their career spans over 30 years and includes performance on 10 Grammy award–winning albums and an impressive discography of over 400 recordings with jazz legends such as Betty Carter, Tommy Flanagan, Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Peterson, McCoy Tyner, Hank Jones, Joe Henderson, Sonny Rollins, Ron Carter and Clark Terry, as well as such contemporary jazz artists as Branford Marsalis, Wynton Marsalis, Diana Krall, Joe Lovano and Roy Hargrove. Nash has become a highly sought after jazz educator and is sponsored by Sakae drums, Zildjian cymbals, Remo drumheads and Vic Firth drumsticks.
Nash was born and raised in the Phoenix metropolitan area, attending Percy L. Julian School, East Phoenix High School and Arizona State University. Nash credits local mentors in the 1970s, pianists Charles Lewis and Keith Greko, pianist-composer Prince Shell, saxophonist Allan Chase and ASU jazz program founder Bob Miller with giving them a tremendous foundation and their start in jazz. Nash moved to New York in 1981 but has kept many ties with the Phoenix community, and in 2012 the local jazz organization, Jazz in Arizona, founded The Nash, a jazz club in downtown Phoenix named for Nash. The club is now recognized by Downbeat Magazine as one of the top jazz venues in the United States.
“This is a tremendous opportunity for our students and faculty,” said Michael Kocour, associate professor and director of jazz studies. “While I as a longtime jazz educator may hypothesize with our students about the performance practices and compositional thinking that have gone into the making of some of the most significant jazz recordings of our time, Lewis Nash can speak to our students directly about what it was like to actually make those recordings. There's a big difference.”
Nash will teach applied lessons, a rhythm section class, jazz combos and a jazz repertoire class, and will contribute to community engagement and recruiting the talented jazz musicians of tomorrow for the ASU School of Music jazz studies program. Nash will continue their active schedule of performances around the world as part of their faculty role.
“I am truly honored to accept the Bob and Gretchen Ravenscroft Professor of Practice role in the ASU School of Music,” Nash said. “The school's mission of preparing creative leaders who will transform our society through music inspires me, and I look forward to the opportunity to play a role in the nurturing of the next generation of jazz artists.”
This named position was made possible by a sizeable gift from Bob and Gretchen Ravenscroft, longtime supporters of the ASU jazz program. Bob Ravenscroft is an accomplished pianist-keyboardist, jazz musician, composer, recording artist, teacher and entrepreneur whose creative work represents the flexible and interdisciplinary thinking that all music students in the ASU School of Music aspire to develop.
“The Ravenscrofts have been wonderful contributors to our jazz program for many years,” Landes said. “Their support of the arts and jazz, in particular, in the Phoenix metropolitan area, has been unwavering. We are grateful to the Ravenscrofts for their incredible generosity and for this sustainable gift supporting musical innovation in the ASU School of Music.”
Harlem in the 1980's was a place you couldn't give brownstones away. The urban soundscape comprised shotguns and sirens and the Koch administration held a lottery to sell brownstones to local residents for $5000 and pay for the repairs. It was a far cry from its heyday–a preeminent African American neighborhood known for its jazz, blues and soul, the literature of Langston Hughes, Nora Neale Hurston, William Baldwin and more recently, Maya Angelou. It was also a far cry from it's now becoming.

Indicative of the rapidity of change that has spread across New York's historically black boroughs like a firestorm over arid brush, late poet, Maya Angelou's Harlem brownstone recently sold for $4.08 million. It was purchased as a shell in 2004. However, as far as Harlem based author Renee Watson is concerned Uptown's heritage is being trampled over in the rush for real estate dollars.
“I've walked past the brownstone where(poet/writer) Langston Hughes lived many times and wondered why it was empty,” they explain. “How could it be that their home wasn't preserved as a space for poets, a space to honor their legacy? I'd pass the brownstone, shake my head, and say, ‘Someone should do something.' I have stopped saying, ‘Someone should do something' and I've gathered a group of writers and artists and we are trying to do something.”
Watson has formed the nonprofit organization, I, Too, Arts Collective with the goal of creating a space for emerging and established authors to gather, create, and showcase their work. The organization's first project is to preserve and celebrate the legacy of Langston Hughes by leasing the Harlem brownstone where they lived and created during the last twenty years of their life. Unlike other New York nabes noticeably in Bedstuy and Crown Heights, getting the city stave off developers by landmarking large sections of Harlem are proving an uphill battle.
“Landmarking is rarely a neighborhood's top concern when there are more pressing issues,” Christopher Moore, a former curator at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and one of the longest-serving commissioners at the landmarks commission, from 1995 to 2015 told the New York Times recently. “The commission is not omnipotent, like many people think.”
In Watson's favor is the fact that Langston Hughes' former home is currently vacant and needs work. The owner, who lives in Upstate New York and is empathetic to their cause, has given Watson until August 31st to secure funding and sign a lease.
[perfectpullquote align=”left” cite=”” link=”” color=”” class=”” size=””]“She's believes in our mission and doesn't just want to rent it to anyone,” Watson says.[/perfectpullquote]
“There are a lot of people in Harlem, black owned businesses, that are passionate about holding on the area's legacy in small ways. Recently I went to Sugar Hill Children's Museum and it was inspiring to see Harlem honor its culture and community. I understand people want to make as much money as they can through real estate but I think there has to be some balance, especially in Harlem.”
As you'll see in the chart below, Cron's typical roto stats have steadily increased during their time in the majors. He's on pace (though I'm not too big on using that unless I have to) a slight regression in home runs, with 13, but he's looking at a steady, if not gaudy, .279 average, 50 runs scored and 64 batted in. At 18% owned in CBS leagues, those aren't bad numbers for a backup first baseman. Their BABIP is at a steady .306, right in the range we should expect, so it's not like he's getting overly lucky or anything. He's raised their walk percentage by more than DOUBLE what it was last year, to 9.5%. He's also lowered their strikeout rate to under 14%, almost 7% less than it was last year. He's seeing the ball much better.
C.J. Cron has hit safely in their last six games, including 2 home runs they launched against Seattle and St. Louis. It's true, this is a guy who will likely lose SOME at bats against NL teams when the Angels want to move Pujols on to first, play the matchups or just give them a day off. But if their 3 game set against St. Louis is any indication, those days are going to be few and far between. They won't be benched nearly as often as Toronto is sitting our asupervisorstioned pickup, Justin Smoak.
I got on the Cron bandwagon early in their 2014 campaign and it didn't really pan out, but they did show some promise, and they seemed to just be missing the discipline at the plate that they seem to have recently started to find.
I believe the .279 average he's holding now will be close to what they finish with, though I wouldn't be surprised if it dipped closer to .265 - .270. The home run power is real, and so long as they get full time at bats I expect them to hit an easy 15, topping out closer to 20. The RBIs will be there with Calhoun, Trout and Pujols batting around them in the lineup, among the other decent at bats. If they get 4 more steals on the year, I'd be surprised, but they did swipe 8 bags in their 2013 Double A campaign, so.. anything's possible I guess.

CLOSE A week of shipwrecks in the Mediterranean culminated Sunday with 700 migrants feared dead and survivors giving harrowing testimony of dozens of small children drowned. Around 1,900 migrants were rescued by the Italian coastguards that day in the Can Newslook

Horrific stories emerged Sunday about more than 700 migrants who drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea since Wednesday, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
Rescuers saved 14,000 people at sea last week, by far the highest weekly number yet this year, said William Spindler, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
"This is by far the busiest week this year in terms of operations, people rescued but also in terms of casualties," Spindler said Sunday.
The rescues involved a flotilla of ships from multiple nations, including Italy, Ireland and Germany, according to The Irish Times.
One incident Thursday involved two overloaded boats, one towing another that didn't have a motor, which smugglers had cut loose when the boat began to disintegrate and take on water, Spindler said.
The motorless boat was loaded with 675 people — and 25 of them jumped off and swam to the other boat. Rescuers later saved another 79 people and pulled 15 bodies from the water, they said. About 550 were missing and presumed dead, they said.
Police in the port city of Pozzallo, Sicily, where survivors were taken, arrested a Sudanese national, Adam Tarik, 29, on smuggling and murder charges, according to Ragusa police patrol chief Nino Ciavola, the Italian newspaper La Stampa reported.
The two old fishing boats had left from the Libyan port of Sabratha, according to La Repubblica,another Italian newspaper. After eight hours at sea, one boat began taking on water, and some passengers jumped. Many drowned, and more died when the tow rope was cut a few minutes later, the newspaper reported. One woman, whose body was later recovered, was almost decapitated by the rope that whipped around after it was cut, the paper said.
Another 100 people are missing from a smuggler's boat that capsized Wednesday, Spindler said. The boat capsized as the Italian navy approached, and passengers moved to the side closest to the approaching rescue ship. Photographs and video of the disaster were captured by Italian sailors and posted to the Internet.
Rescuers also recovered 45 bodies and saved 135 people from a third wreck on Friday, where an unknown number of people are missing, Spindler said.
Survivors were taken to the Italian ports of Taranto and Pozzallo and the Greek island of Lampeduza. One survivor was a 9-month-old girl named Favour, whose mother and father died at sea when their boat capsized, Spindler said. Many Italians have offered to adopt her, they said.
The International Organization on Migration estimates that 194,611 migrants and refugees entered Europe so far this year, with more than 1,475 missing.

Russia is bombing rebel-held areas in Syria at a furious pace. That is giving the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, the upper hand. Meanwhile, critics accuse the United States of dithering.
The war, approaching its sixth year, may be reaching a turning point in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and once its commercial capital. Government-aligned forces are trying to encircle its eastern half, controlled by rebels since 2012. If the government succeeds, it would be the greatest blow to the opposition in years.
But the battlefield is unpredictable. If the government regains full control of Aleppo, will the war begin to wind down, or will it escalate?
What Is Assad Doing?
Backed by the Russian airstrikes, Syrian government forces and Iran-backed militias are trying to besiege the rebel-held section of Aleppo to starve the rebels into submission — the same method government forces used to recapture another major city, Homs. Using starvation as a weapon is a war crime, but it has been widely used in the Syrian war.
A spokesperson for the Gadaffi family has said that Saif al-Islam Gadaffi, the son of the former Libyan leader will contest in the upcoming presidential elections.
Basem al-Hashimi al-Soul told the influential local media agency, Egypt Today, that Saif al-Islam has the support and credentials required to end the chaos that has gripped Libya since the overthrow of their father Muammar Gadaffi in 2011.
“Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former Libyan president, enjoys the support of major tribes in Libya so they can run for the upcoming presidential elections due in 2018,” said Libyan Tribal Chief and spokesperson of the Gaddafi family, Basem al-Hashimi al-Soul
Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former Libyan president, enjoys the support of major tribes in Libya so they can run for the upcoming presidential elections due in 2018
Al-Soul says that a platform to launch the former first son's presidential campaign will soon be launched.
“The platform includes some procedures that Saif al-Islam hopes the United Nations would adopt to help Libya move from the incumbent transitional period to stability.”
Today, Libya is grappling with insecurity as different factions control different parts of the country.
Saif al-Islam Gadaffi hopes to unify the factions and restore peace and stability in the country that was once prosperous under their father's rule.
“Saif al-Islam plans to impose more security and stability in accordance with the Libyan geography and in coordination with all Libyan factions,” al-Soul manifested.
This development follows the weekend announcement by the Eastern Libyan military commander, Khalifa Haftar, that they ‘would listen to the will of the free Libyan people', interpreted as an indication that they might run in next year's elections.
The United Nations backed Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) has indicated that elections may be held in mid-2018.
“We believe that presidential elections will be held in the middle of 2018,” Mohamed Siala, GNA foreign minister, speaking to foreign reporters at the Valdai Panel Discussion in Russia.
Saif Al-Islam was released in June this year after six years of captivity by a militia group in the Libyan town of Zintan.
They had been captured in November 2011 after the fall of their father's regime, and they were subsequently sentenced to death in absentia by a court in Tripoli.
Following their release, the International Criminal Court ordered for their arrest and surrender, which was backed by the GNA.
 They are wanted by the ICC on charges of crimes against humanity during their father's unsuccessful attempts to put down the rebellion that eventually led to the fall of their regime.
The United Nations is supporting the voter registration process as it seeks to reconcile rival factions and relaunch a political transition that would lead to new polls.
The UN Libya mission has previously said it hopes elections can be held by the end of next year, but has also acknowledged complex security, political and legislative challenges to organising a vote.
Libya last held elections in 2014 but the results were disputed, deepening divisions that emerged after the country's 2011 uprising.
The poll led to an escalation of armed conflict and to rival parliaments and governments being set up in the capital and the east.
That didn't take long. Despite deluging the country with stories on Roy Moore, ABC and NBC's morning shows, Monday, avoided any coverage of Al Franken and the ongoing charges of sexual harassment. CBS This Morning allowed a scant 28 seconds to the Democrat's assertions they will not resign. Between all three networks, that's 28 seconds out of a combined 8 HOURS of available air time.
It was only a couple hours after the airing of these morning shows that a new accuser stepped forward to claim Franken grabbed their rear end and “groped” her, according to the man's wife.
On CBS This Morning, guest co-host Vladimir Duthiers: updated:
Democratic Senator Al Franken's office says they will not resign over allegations of sexual misconduct. A Franken spokesperson told The Minneapolis Tribune they are spending time with their family and doing a lot of reflecting. Franken has apologized to talk radio news anchor Leeann Tweeden, who says they kissed and groped them during a 2006 USO tour. PBS is editing the former Saturday Night Live performer out of a special honoring David Letterman that airs tonight. It says, “Including Franken would be a distraction.”
Later on CNN, reporter MJ Lee revealed the story of the latest accuser.
They explained on CNN.com:
Lindsay Menz, a 33-year-old woman who now lives in Frisco, Texas, reached out to CNN on Thursday hours after Tweeden made their story public. Menz said they wanted to share an "uncomfortable" interaction that left them feeling "gross." According to Menz, they attended the Minnesota State Fair with their husband and father in the summer of 2010, almost two years after Franken was elected to the Senate. Them father's small business was sponsoring a local radio booth, and they spent the day meeting various elected officials, political candidates and celebrities and taking photos with them as they stopped by the booth. When Franken walked in, Menz and their husband, who also spoke with CNN, said they recognized them right away. Menz said they had a brief and cordial exchange with the senator.
Then, as their husband held up their phone and got ready to snap a photo of the two of them, Franken "pulled me in really close, like awkward close, and as my husband took the picture, they put their hand full-fledged on my rear," Menz said. "It was wrapped tightly around my butt cheek." "It wasn't around my waist. It wasn't around my hip or side. It was definitely on my butt," they said, recalling that the brazen act lasted three or four seconds. "I was like, oh my God, what's happening."
Over six days, the networks devoted 125 minutes to Roy Moore. With the number of Franken accusers mounting, will journalists do the fair thing and devote extensive coverage to the charges against the Democrat? Or is this sort of attention only warranted for Republicans?
To see an MSNBC journalist referring to Franken's action as “not actually groping,” go here.

Shortly after the election, I wrote an article saying that far from embracing progressives, the Democratic Party would rebuff them. Far from resisting Trump, the party would facilitate him. The article was the case and blueprint for a new progressive party founded by Bernie Sanders.
From that day on, people have approached me without pause asking how they can make it a reality. A growing number of us watched as the Democrats shut progressives out and collaborated with the Republicans. Activists, academics, artists, delegates, volunteers, and former Sanders staff came together around the idea. We waited for someone to call Sanders to a new movement-party. Till one day, we realized that it was up to us, and Draft Bernie for a People's Party was born.
Over the next few weeks, we will be making the case for starting fresh. We hope you will engage in the conversation, and should you be persuaded, we hope you will join us.
Since the presidential election, there has been a remarkable exodus from the Democratic Party. More than 14 million people have left and become independents. That represents a loss of nearly 20 percent of the party's following from early November. The number of Democrats has fallen to a historic low. So low that Republicans now outnumber Democrats in a progressive country.
Despite Bernie Sanders' monumental endeavor to bring people into the Democratic Party, people are leaving it by the millions. The collective efforts to reform the party cannot stem the tide of people who are going independent, let alone expand the Democratic base.
At a time when Americans are leaving the establishment parties in record numbers, progressives shouldn't be swimming against the populist current in a fruitless attempt to save the corporate party that created this mess.
The people are leading the way to an independent alternative. What if instead of struggling against the current, we swam with them?
History offers a successful model for building a new party in America. A popular politician builds a large following in the establishment parties by representing a neglected majority. Then they break from the old regime to form a populist party. This is how the Republican and Democratic Parties were created.
If Sanders starts a new party, we would begin with the least half of the Democratic base.
If Sanders starts a new party, we would begin with the least half of the Democratic base. Then we would add independents, anti-establishment voters, the white working class, young voters, third party supporters, people who've given up on the political process, and many conservatives who just want a decent life. Now we've got something far larger than the Democratic and Republican parties.
We spend the next four years laying the foundation for ultimate progressive victory instead of just opposing Trump. The people's party galvanizes the strongest sustained resistance. It gives us a revolutionary home where we can build the political power necessary to win in two and four years. The Sanders campaign taught us that it isn't enough to frighten people into sustained action, you must also give them a bold vision to believe in and strive for.
There have been many attempts to reform the Democratic Party over the past few decades. Progressive movements millions-strong were unable to change the direction of the party or the country at a time when it was less entrenched and money in politics was less pervasive.
We know where that path leads. Even the most progressive candidates for DNC chair do not oppose large campaign contributions to party politicians from billionaires and super PACs. Nor have they proposed banning lobbyists gifts or closing the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street. How can we free our government from the influence of the oligarchs without even challenging their mechanisms of political control?
Our country was much more sharply divided over slavery than it is over present-day money in politics and inequality. Yet Lincoln's Republicans replaced the Whig Party in four years. If Sanders starts a people's party representing the views of the large majority of the American public, we can replace an establishment party in four years too.
Bernie Sanders can follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Van Buren. Both men became president a few years after building their parties.
The creation of the Democratic and Republican Parties ushered in a decades-long period of dominance for each. As we replace the Democratic Party, we will be left with a corporate authoritarian party as our only opposition. This moment can mark the beginning of a 21st century progressive era.
We choose that future.
Rio's new subway line is running out of time before Olympics

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Two construction workers chatted while applying white grout to the walls of a new subway tunnel one recent day, their voices and the smells of the building materials stark reminders of what was missing: passengers and trains.
Seven weeks before the Summer Olympic Games commence, a subway expansion that was supposed to transport hundreds of thousands of athletes and fans is not done. While Brazilian officials insist it can still be finished in time, frequent delays, skyrocketing costs, a financing snag and potential legal wrangling have created doubts.
Even if Rio de Janeiro completes the key part of the expansion in time, transportation experts worry it may be too late to adequately test the system before the Aug. 5 Olympics opening ceremony. The launch date has been repeatedly pushed back, with officials now saying they'll cut the ribbon four days before competition begins.
“They are leaving so little time to try this massive system,” said Jose Manoel Ferreira Goncalves, president of FerroFrente, an organization of railway experts. “What guarantee do we have that such a sensitive and complicated project is in order?”
“Every hour counts,” Rodrigo Vieira, Rio de Janeiro's transportation head, told The Associated Press, insisting the job would be finished. “We are working around the clock, 24/7 with 1,000 workers in each station.”
Line 4 of the subway system was to be Rio's most important Olympic infrastructure project. It was designed to transport passengers from world-famous Ipanema beach to the modern suburb of Barra da Tijuca, home of the Olympic Park and Village, in less than 15 minutes, as well as to most venues where athletes will compete.
In contrast, the drive along the highway through lush mountains and shantytowns takes more than an hour on a good day, raising the specter of a logistics nightmare if the line isn't built and hundreds of thousands of visitors have to take buses or cars on already-clogged roads.
When Brazil won its bid back in 2009 to hold the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, its economic fortunes were far different. The discoveries of rich, offshore oil fields in 2007 made major infrastructure projects like Line 4 seem possible back then.
But as global oil prices plunged in recent years, the state's accounts were hit hard. The oil sector in Latin America's largest nation has also been rocked by a major investigation into a colossal kickback scheme at state oil company Petrobras.
Now, Rio state's finances are in such bad shape the acting governor on Friday declared a state of financial disaster, a move giving them more freedom to manage shrinking resources without breaking fiscal laws. Rio state has been skipping payments to teachers and retired workers. Some police stations are missing basic items like toilet paper, and residents have felt obligated to pitch in.
“As the wealth has been wiped out, the dreams we had of the big transformations have also faded,” said Gilberto Braga, a finance professor at Ibmec university in Rio.
The state recently failed to make an $8.3 million payment on a loan to the French Development Agency, which is helping pay for the subway project, forcing the federal government to intervene.
Because of the missed payment, the federal government became wary of Rio state acquiring more debt. Brazil's finance ministry now says it is reviewing the state's ability to handle more loans and has held up $284 million that a national bank dedicated to infrastructure projects had earmarked to complete the line.
“Rio's financial worries are notorious. I acknowledge that it's not a small feat (for the federal government) to approve a loan to a state in financial problems,” the state's financial secretary, Julio Bueno, told the AP. “On the other hand, we have the Olympics. The subway is vital.”
Despite optimism it will come together, city officials have devised backup plans, such as special lanes and a rapid transit system for buses.
Officials have dialed down expectations for the subway project for months.
Last-minute construction on the line has created fears after an April bike lane collapse that plunged two joggers to their deaths. An ocean-front section of the lane, an Olympic beautification project inaugurated in January, collapsed into a heap of broken cement when struck by a large wave.
Problems with other recently inaugurated Olympics-related projects have multiplied worries. A new light rail system connecting Rio's renovated port area to one of the airports recently suffered a major power outage on the second day of service, forcing passengers to get off. A highway near Barra da Tijuca that was inaugurated earlier this month is already damaged with potholes and large cracks.
FerroFrente filed a civil complaint Sunday asking a judge to bar passengers from riding the new subway line until the project is inspected and certified by independent companies. The lack of certifications “could have consequences in the great Olympic event,” the complaint said, “and it is certainly preferable for the project not to be opened rather than for it to be a threat to thousands of people.”
State auditors are examining why subway costs ballooned from the initial $1.6 billion estimate several years ago to $2.9 billion now expected. They also are seeking more information about plans to test the new line.
“We want to know whether shortening the time to test the subway puts the safety of the passengers at risk,” said Jonas Lopes, president of Rio de Janeiro state's court of auditors.
Delays, blown budgets and graft are constant problems in Brazil.
Federal police are investigating whether Odebrecht, a builder in the subway consortium, paid bribes to officials connected to Line 4′s creation. Another builder involved in the project, Queiroz Galvao, had its assets frozen in the Petrobras scandal.
Meanwhile, full operation of Line 4 has been postponed to 2018.
“It's the way things work here,” said 70-year-old Hivonete Reis, complaining about how long it has taken to expand the subway to the southern part of the city where they live. “They never give us anything on time.”
Democratic Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said on Saturday that climate change is directly related to terrorism.
“In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism,” said Sanders.
“And if we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you're going to see counties all over the world…they're going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you're going to see all kinds of international conflict.”
Sanders said at the second Democratic debate in Iowa that climate change poses the biggest threat to America's national security and to security of the world.
Sanders also argued that the growth of national terrorism and instability in the Middle East was caused by the invasion of Iraq.
“I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS,” Sanders said.
When Sanders was asked their thoughts about Hillary Clinton's vote for the Iraq war they added: ” I don't think any sensible person would disagree that the invasion of Iraq led to the massive level of instability we are seeing right now.”
“I think that was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the more than history of the United States,” hr claimed.
Three distinct, orange-and-white cars have begun roaming the residential streets of west Aurora, but they aren't taxi cabs, and chances are, you don't want them stopping in front of your car.
“A lot of people don't know about this yet, so they come outside a little upset,” said Huston Jones, one of Aurora's five new parking enforcement officers. “I've actually had people come out in the middle of the street and stop me, demanding to know what I'm doing on their block.
“But once I explain that I'm here to enforce the new parking code and get unwanted cars out of their way, they're very nice.”
On Jan. 1, the city launched Park Aurora, a parking management division that is responsible for establishing and enforcing a public parking plan for the city's northwest and southwest neighborhoods, predominately west of Chambers Road, where growing retail and residential density is quickly devouring open spaces and street parking.
“Aurora has been developing a plan to manage parking for almost 10 years,” said Robert Ferrin, Aurora's first parking and mobility manager. “We have never managed our on-street parking before, and that's become a problem, particularly along the RTD R-Line and in areas where the growth and development is exponential.”
Ferrin joined the city two years ago after years managing the parking program for the City and County of Denver.
“I started early to figure out how all of this would work,” Ferrin said. “This is all brand new for Aurora.”
At its core, Park Aurora's parking code is simple: Don't park in front of fire hydrants and stop signs, don't have expired registration tags, don't block your driveway and so on. The city is now issuing $30 tickets for those types of universal violations.
But there are new, regulations: Street parking is time-limited in some areas and requires a permit in others.
One of Park Aurora's major programs is the Neighborhood Parking Permit program, which applies primarily to areas in north and southwest Aurora. Essentially, the registration program guarantees that residents in these increasingly dense communities — where places like the Stanley Marketplace have recently opened — can always find parking in front of or near their homes.
“The (Neighborhood Parking Permit) program was a bit surprising to us because a lot of us didn't think we needed permits to park in front of our own homes — that we were already in that bad of shape,” said Nadine Caldwell, who has lived in northwest Aurora for 59 years and serves on the board of directors for the Northwest Aurora Neighborhood Organization.
“But something needs to be done,” they said. “It's very difficult to find a parking place in the Stanley parking lot, and then you have to go out to the street and park, which spills into the neighborhoods.”
People living in one of the nine designated parking districts in Aurora can apply to receive monthly parking permits to show they are authorized to park there. There are currently 1,800 parking permit holders in the city.
The city is considering two more parking districts — one outside the Stanley Marketplace and another west of Peoria Street, around the Anschutz Medical Campus, Ferrin said.
“We want to make sure that residents who have lived in northwest Aurora for decades, and who are now seeing some really great redevelopment happening, are not becoming inundated with shoppers and construction workers and healthcare professionals and so on taking up all the parking outside their homes,” they said. “I think a lot of people are really happy with the way that we've really cleaned up the streets already — there's a place for people to park when they get home and junk cars are getting off the streets.”
Ferrin plans to propose two-hour street parking limits around the Stanley Marketplace and along East Colfax Avenue, in the Aurora Cultural Arts District, to be implemented in fall. Violators of these new rules could get $30 tickets.
Park Aurora can generate money for the city through citations and pay-to-park garages at city-owned facilities like the Hyatt, Iliff Station Garage, Aurora Municipal Center, RTD facilities and transit station bike parking. Ferrin estimates Park Aurora will bring the city about $200,000 in revenue this year, primarily from garage parking pass sales.
The department contracts with five parking enforcement officers who alternate day shifts, driving around the city in decked-out Subaru Imprezas complete with license plate camera readers that know almost automatically if a car is parked somewhere illegally. Dash computer systems beep when violations are recognized, letting officers know to stop and take photos of cars and print out tickets, if necessary.
Ferrin said that as of May 30, the city had issued 6,723 parking citations since Jan. 1. Historically, the city issued about 5,300 tickets per year. Ferrin said the jump is because of more resources in the field.
Jones said they give out 20 to 40 parking citations per day, and many of them result in warnings.
“They add up really quickly, depending on where you are,” Jones said. “The Costco off Havana is a big area for semi-trucks … Drivers like to pull around back and get some sleep, but that's against the code so I issued tickets and explained things.
“Then I went back over there yesterday, and there wasn't one single truck parked there,” they said. “So it's making a difference. I just try to work with everyone.”
About 25 percent of the citations Jones and their colleagues hand out are warnings. Forty-five percent of recent tickets are given for expired registration.
“We're not here to make revenue on citations,” Jones said. “Right now, the most important thing is telling people what the compliance is so they can understand it, and then giving them some time to fix whatever they need to fix.”

According to an article over at the Hollywood Reporter, the upcoming release of The Hobbit will be the catalyst that finally drives movie theaters to upgrade their projection hardware to 48 frames-per-second (fps) or better. The current theater playback technology supports 24fps, a standard that dates back to the 1920s; this, in-turn, was an upgrade from the 16fps that was common for earlier silent films. As video-game enthusiasts are keenly aware, a higher frame-rate reduces jitter and provides much smoother video playback, and that translates to a more immersive and realistic experience overall. And for the trivia buffs among you, the move from 16fps to 24fps was necessitated by the advent of movie audio — the original 16fps film speed moved too slowly to produce quality sound playback.

In recent years, theaters have been steadily converting from celluloid-film projectors to digital projection technology, although not without serious objection from such respected industry pundits as Roger Ebert. For those locations that have already gone digital, the upgrade to 48fps will simply involve a software upgrade and modest hardware investment.
Of course, improvements to the playback capabilities also require changes to the original filming. As we saw in a previous posting here at GeekDad, Peter Jackson is using Red EPIC digital cameras to film The Hobbit. The move to high-res, high-framerate in turn creates challenges for the crew that the technically-inclined GeekDad audience will appreciate:
A huge challenge across the board is the volume of data that is required for HFRs. Oatley reported that for The Hobbit production shoots 6-12TB of camera data per day. And the shooting schedule (for both parts of the two-part film) involves 265 days of principal photography.
That amount of data means that modern film-making is a serious IT operation requiring massive data centers and an army of dwarves, er, geeks to run them.
Oh – and as if Peter Jackson and The Hobbit don't provide incentive enough for this projector upgrade, some guy named James Cameron is also pushing for the same thing in preparation for a little project of their called Avatar 2.
Head over to the Hollywood Reporter for the full story.
Just a Little More Trivia:
At the moment, video playback in most theaters is 2048×1080 at 24fps, which is pretty close to Blu-Ray's 24fps for 1920x1080 progressive-scan video. Of course, frame rate is distinctly different from refresh rate, so that "120Hz" number the salesperson quoted you has nothing to do with what we're talking about here. Don't worry though – The Hobbit will look great on your home theater in 2013. And if you need to obsess about frame rates, refresh rates, and digital cinema, the Wikipedia articles serve as a good starting point.
There are no technological barriers to staving off a climate crisis. So what's really holding us back?
I've recently returned home after two weeks of intensive meetings, workshops and speaking engagements in the U.S., where this question was at the heart of virtually every conversation.
The most obvious answer, of course, is that the vested interests of the fossil fuel dinosaurs and their powerful lobbyists serve to maintain the status quo. But if we let that stop us, we might as well pack up and go home now. The fossils always have been and always will be immovable objects -- no one has ever really been fooled by greenwash marketing campaigns such as BP's "Beyond Petroleum" or Shell's brief foray into renewables.
A more interesting take on this question was delivered by Jigar Shah -- a dyed-in-the-wool capitalist, albeit one who made a career in clean energy -- at the SXSW Eco conference in Austin. By their estimation, what's missing from the climate debate is a powerful (enough) combination of inspiration and outrage.
They opened their keynote speech describing their excitement watching the final voyage of the Discovery space shuttle from the roof of their office in Washington D.C. They were reminded of the president whose vision more than 50 years earlier had made that moment possible.
When it comes to the clean energy revolution, according to Shah, we're still waiting for that visionary president to inspire us, to suspend our disbelief, to tell us simply, "it's possible." They asked the audience, "20 years from now, what will you be willing to stand on the roof to watch go by? Until a politician can help you answer this question, we won't get to a clean energy future."

Great stuff, but it was when they moved on to the second part of the equation, the question of moral outrage, that they really grabbed my attention. After all, I had just come from New York where I participated in the launch of the 2012 Climate Vulnerability Monitor whose authors estimate that around 400,000 people are dying every year due to hunger and communicable diseases aggravated by climate change and that another 4.5 million or so die from air pollution.
These are shocking figures by any standard, but were we, the public, truly shocked? The problem with the climate movement, according to Shah, is our failure to effectively communicate and mobilize around a powerful sense of moral outrage:
People aren't getting mercury in their bloodstream because we're dumping thermometers in the river. It's coming from toxic fuels like coal. We allow companies to dump their externalities into our health care system, which we pay real money for. And apparently we don't care enough about our neighbors to keep them healthy.
And further:
Doing good things in in our communities is great, but it doesn't give me hope we can defeat the 6° agenda. We are never going to win this battle with technology alone. If we can't make the case that in essence we are trading off human lives for the economy, we're going to lose, and lose badly. We have lost our outrage.
Their comments brought to mind the debate about whether it's enough to reduce fossil fuel consumption even if we don't do it for the "right" (climate) reasons. The argument goes that the climate doesn't care why you reduce your emissions, only that you do it. And this is true to a degree -- if you buy a small car to save on fuel prices, you won't trade it in if gas prices go down again.
But just like the difference between climate and weather, the trends are of greater concern than individual behavior. How can it be that investment in clean energy is heading for a disappointing drop in 2012 while the International Energy Agency warns that without a radical change in direction, in just a few short years we will have closed the door to limiting global temperature rise to 2°?
Please pause for a second, and read that last sentence again.
Shah's reference to externalities and the trade-off of human lives for short-term economic gain is key, and this ultimately comes down to a failure of political will. The failure of politicians to level the playing field for fossil fuel and renewables subsidies -- renewables receive on the order of 8 cents for every one dollar received by fossils. Their failure to adopt caps on carbon emissions and effectively address climate change. Their failure to make it illegal to kill people with toxic, dirty fuels such as coal.
Did you ever see the movie It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World made in 1963? Well 50 years on, we'd need to add at least three or four more "Mads" to the title to even begin to describe the insane politics of climate and energy policy.
Shah thinks it's the job of the movement to deliver the moral outrage, leaving the financial and business cases to be made by experts in those fields, like renowned economist Nicholas Stern who just called out Britain's anti-market approach to innovation in the energy market.
I would agree that whether it's taking a single action with the power and dignity of a Rosa Parks (or Eleanor Fairchild) or participating in mass actions of non-violent civil disobedience, each and every one of us has a moral imperative to speak out, and ultimately to hold our elected officials' feet to the fire. If we don't do it, who will?
Footage from the roadside shows how Peter Sagan crashed and brought down Greg Van Avermaet and Oliver Naesen
New video footage shows a fan's jacket over the barriers in the Tour of Flanders yesterday caused world champion Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) to crash on the Oude Kwaremont.
>>> Fabian Cancellara: Peter Sagan made a mistake riding too close to the barrier
Sagan, racing in white world champion jersey with rainbow stripes, suddenly fell hard on the rough grey and dusty cobble sector after the climb. They had been leading the chase of solo leader and eventual winner Philippe Gilbert (Quick-Step Floors). With 16.9km to race, they trailed by 59 seconds.
A video obtained by Cycling Weekly shows a black jacket innocently propped on the metal barriers separating the fans from the cyclists led to Sagan's end. Racing along the left gutter, their left brake/shifter lever snagged the fan's jacket and caused their front wheel to turn immediately towards the barrier. A split-second later, they hit the foot of the barrier, tumbled and landed on their right hip.
Greg Van Avermaet (BMC Racing) and Oliver Naesen (Ag2r La Mondiale) chased behind them and crashed, as well. Only Van Avermaet could return to their bike immediately. Sagan lost time both stunned by the incident and stalled by a broken rear wheel and derailleur. They continued, but in the groups behind and settled for 27th place.
Sagan's German WorldTour team pleaded to fans to post any footage they may have to clarify the incident.
“I hope again that all those phones that are around can show something new bring some light to what happened,” Bora sports director Patxi Vila said. “Nothing will change, but we can understand what happened.”
Sagan saw other images posted in the last 24 hours and commented in Twitter. They said, “Video that shows my crash at the [Ronde] was caused by a jacket that caught my left arm. These things happen in races.”
I am sure this video verifies the feeling I had about the cause of my crash yesterday at the Tour of Flanders. I was close to the barrier but I was in control when I felt that something caught my left arm, maybe the jacket that is seen later on me. I wouldn't have clipped the barrier with my wheel if I hadn't had my arm caught by that object. However, these things happen in racing and I now have to focus on Paris-Roubaix. (Video by @Seal_Jobs) A post shared by Peter Sagan (@petosagan) on Apr 3, 2017 at 6:42am PDT
They raced to defend their title and explained that they could have had a chance if the jacket had not stopped him.
“I think I could've gone on to catch Gilbert, for that reason I was going how I was,” Sagan said yesterday. “I had strong companions with me, I thought I could re-catch on, for that reason we were going strong. Just that destiny didn't want it.”
Sagan underwent checks at the hospital yesterday. They explained to Cycling Weekly standing at the door of the Oudenaarde hospital that they hurt their right hip. However, it seems they are ready to return for Paris-Roubaix next Sunday.
Much has been made of the news that Tea Party queen Sarah Palin and Fox News, the cable network that served as the PR agency for the Tea Party, have parted ways. The reporting generally implied that Palin had turned down Fox's offer to renew their contract. That is, in all likelihood, exactly what happened.
However, contract negotiations are more complex than that. And now we have reporting from CNN's Howard Kurtz that fleshes out some of the ambiguities of the original stories. On their program Reliable Sources, Kurtz expanded on the matter by saying…
“My reporting shows that Fox News did offer Sarah Palin a new contract, but it is what I would call a low-ball offer, significantly less, a fraction of the million dollars a year they had been paid.”
In other words, Fox deliberately made an offer that they knew Palin would reject because they had no interest in retaining them beyond their current contract. As speculated previously here at News Corpse, Fox probably “offered them a moose burger and parking validation to re-up – and even that would have been more than she's worth.” After all, why would Fox continue to overpay someone about whom Fox CEO Roger Ailes reportedly said they think is an idiot?
Palin's star has been fading fast. Fox News only posted a modified AP story about the separation on their web site. Fox Nation, known for its rabid partisanship and rank dishonesty, didn't report on it all. As evidence of Palin's rapidly declining value, their first post-Fox stop was at the Internet's home of doctored videos and right-wing propaganda, Breitbart News. There they answered a couple of vacant questions from BreitBrat Stephen Bannon, the sycophantic producer of the fawning Palin crockumentary, “The Undefeated” (the most ironically named box office bomb ever, considering it chronicles one of modern history's most frequently defeated political failures).
In response to Bannon's query about what they planned to do next, Palin had no answer other than vagaries about their desire to quit “preaching to the choir.” They spoke of “sharing more broadly the message of the beauty of freedom” to a larger audience. They didn't give any indication of where they would find an audience receptive to their wingnuttery that they think is larger than Fox News from which they were just ousted. The narrow appeal of their conservative extremism is unlikely to find much acceptance beyond the tiny choir that is currently singing from their warped hymnal.
Then Bannon asked them where they think the country stands today and they launched into a dirty laundry list of every worn out criticism the right has lobbed at Obama for four years. They spoke of deficits and unemployment – problems that resulted from George Bush's mismanagement of the economy and have improved under Obama. Of course, they also included fabricated controversies about ObamaCare, Benghazi, and gun control, that are a staple of the right's outrage machine.
Palin told BreitBrat Bannon that “Conservatism didn't lose.” They blame the 2012 GOP debacle entirely on Mitt Romney, despite the fact that they ran as a “severely conservative” candidate embracing every position held dear to the Republican far-right fringe. And they declare that “we haven't begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us.” In that regard they must be filled to the brim with delight, because it would hard to have a lower estimation of the woman who thinks a “gotcha” question is “What magazines do you read.”
On the basis of that level of insightful commentary, it's no wonder that Fox chose to insult Palin with a pittance of their prior pay, and free them to tarnish the reputation of some other news enterprise (i.e. Breitbart). Apparently somebody at Fox has concluded that their reputation has already been tarnished enough.
"Police had information that a group of Muslim Brotherhood members were preparing to carry out aggressive acts in the coming days using explosives and crude bombs," the Interior Ministry said in a statement. "This group was using an apartment in a Cairo building, and on Thursday night the police raided this apartment where they found a number of crude bombs."
According to the Egyptian government's version of events, Thursday's blast occurred while security forces were moving into an apartment that they suspected harbored militants. Initial reports said that at least six people were killed. A Giza official later said that the death toll included seven police personnel and three civilians.
"There's definitely a problem brewing underneath the surface of Cairo when it comes to extremist recruitment," they said.
The rival claims illustrate how the Egyptian mainland has become a hotbed of militant activity, said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow in the program on extremism at George Washington University's Center for Cyber and Homeland Security.

Both the Islamic State and another militant group known as Revolutionary Punishment have issued competing claims of responsibility for an explosion on Tuesday that killed a group of police officers and civilians in Giza, a city just southwest of Cairo. The government, for its part, is blaming the incident on the Muslim Brotherhood.
The rival claims illustrate how the Egyptian mainland has become a hotbed of militant activity, said Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow in the program on extremism at George Washington University's Center for Cyber and Homeland Security.
"There's definitely a problem brewing underneath the surface of Cairo when it comes to extremist recruitment," they said.
According to the Egyptian government's version of events, Thursday's blast occurred while security forces were moving into an apartment that they suspected harbored militants. Initial reports said that at least six people were killed. A Giza official later said that the death toll included seven police personnel and three civilians.
"Police had information that a group of Muslim Brotherhood members were preparing to carry out aggressive acts in the coming days using explosives and crude bombs," the Interior Ministry said in a statement. "This group was using an apartment in a Cairo building, and on Thursday night the police raided this apartment where they found a number of crude bombs."
Footage of the explosion's aftermath that was broadcast by local media showed the blown-out apartment building, with debris strewn across the entire street.
On Friday, in a statement issued on social media, the Islamic State's Sinai affiliate said that the apartment was a trap that had been set by its fighters. The bomb went off as part of an elaborate plot to lure police officers into a booby-trapped apartment, according to IS, which claimed that 10 police officers had been killed. The group did not acknowledge the death of civilians.
IS particularly applauded the death of police officer Mohamed Amin, the head of the investigative unit in the neighborhood where the explosion occurred, whom the group had labeled an "apostate."
The Egyptian Interior Ministry dismissed the IS claim, insisting that the Muslim Brotherhood was responsible. It also asserted that Amin was only injured in the blast and remains alive.
Meanwhile, the Revolutionary Punishment group also claimed responsibility for the attack on social media. The group said in a statement posted to Facebook that the blast was a suicide mission, and promised that it would launch similar attacks across Egypt. The group also apologized to civilians who were affected by the explosion and promised to compensate the victims, though it offered no details in how it planned to do so.
It's not surprising that the Egyptian government would be quick to blame the Brotherhood. The group has been forced underground since the Egyptian military overthrew Mohamed Morsi, the country's democratically elected and Brotherhood-backed president, in the summer of 2013. The government then outlawed the Brotherhood and began to round up its members.
In the two years since the coup, militant groups have launched a series of attacks throughout Egypt, and the Egyptian government has consistently linked those attacks to the Brotherhood. Many of the Brotherhood's leaders who managed to escape abroad condemn the violence; senior Brotherhood figures based in Turkey distanced themselves from Thursday's explosion. But Awad explained that the group has fractured within Egypt, with some of its members taking up arms against the state.
"Operationally, the Brotherhood is not operating as a whole body within Egypt," they said.
Egypt has also faced a slow-burning insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula, where an Islamic State affiliate called Sinai Province (previously known as Ansar Bayt al Maqdis), has carried out a series of operations. It claimed responsibility for the bombing of a Russian airliner in the region last fall.
A series of groups in mainland Egypt, including Revolutionary Punishment and the Popular Resistance Movement, have been hitting economic and security targets in Cairo and surrounding governorates. Awad noted that nearly half of the Revolutionary Punishment's assaults have occurred in the Fayoum Governorate, a longtime Brotherhood stronghold, and suggested that there is likely overlap between Revolutionary Punishment and the governorate's branch of the Brotherhood, which remains active underground.
But distinctions between the affiliations of those behind the unrest are difficult to draw, primarily because the Egyptian government's campaign against the Brotherhood has driven Islamists underground while providing a potent recruitment tool for extremism, leading many frustrated Egyptians to retaliate against the state with violence.
Awad noted that uncertainty over precisely who was behind the apartment bombing is to be expected given the complex and shadowy world of militancy in the Giza province where the blast occurred.
"It's a melting pot of Islamist violence that's been brewing for sometime," they remarked.
The situation is such that the cell operating out of the Giza apartment might possibly have had links to both the Islamic State and Revolutionary Punishment.
"Most of these violent actors aren't exactly part of a single group, they are just their own cell," Awad explained. Members of that cell might have overlapped with the Islamic State's Sinai affiliate as well as elements linked to Revolutionary Punishment.
"Perhaps both groups were using the apartment to test explosives," they speculated. "We can't know for sure."

Jim Seida / NBC News Harold Hamm, founder and CEO of Continental Resources, owns the rights to more oil in American ground than anyone.
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. — In the history of oil, this fall is a tipping point, the moment America gurgles past Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world's petroleum king.
The man most responsible is Harold Hamm, 67, a drawling, blue-eyed billionaire, a sharecropper's son who grew to be the richest energy mogul in America. They were the first to profitably “frack” North Dakota oil wells, leading a revolution in the way the nation coaxes energy from the earth and draining momentum from the search for cleaner fuel sources. Their company, Continental Resources, has quintupled in value in a matter of years, emerging as a swaggering promoter of eco-friendly, effectively infinite oil — along with all the supposed good that flows from it.
NBC's Harry Smith reports from a small Oklahoma town on the American oil boom that's leading to dropping gas prices across the country.
Now Hamm seems ready to fight anyone who says otherwise. “Anti-frackers are disingenuous,” they said. “They bow to the religion of environmentalism.”
In a series of interviews with NBC News, the self-described nature-lover crowed about “the great renaissance of oil” they helped create and ridiculed those who blame oil companies for warming the climate or poisoning the earth.
“Some of the extremists are calling it carbon pollution,” they joked between appreciative bites of cheeseburger. “I mean, all of us breathe out carbon dioxide. Are we going to quit breathing?”
'This is a new era'
You'll find no better guide to the new world of energy than Hamm. They fell in love with oil as a gas-pumping teenager, borrowed money to become a wildcatter in their 20s, and spent the next four decades finding treasure where others failed or never tried.
Last month, when U.S. Department of Energy data projected that America had become the globe's new fuel pump and fuse box, Texas remained the biggest producer of crude oil. North Dakota, however, showed the fastest growth, approaching a million barrels of oil a day, up from 10,000 barrels a day in 2003 — and powering the largest five-year petroleum increase in U.S. history.
“This is a new era,” the head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration said at the time, “that you wouldn't in a million years have dreamed about.”
Hamm did more than just dream about it. They recognized the potential of North Dakota's Bakken oil field, which now produces more crude than Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, and their company remains the area's largest leaseholder. This month Continental Resources told investors that the region contains enough recoverable oil to double the official count of U.S. reserves and enough "oil in place" to meet the nation's needs for hundreds of years. While those claims have not been verified by regulators, Hamm's track record makes them hard to doubt.
“He is an expert at execution,” said Rudy Hokanson, an investment analyst for Barrington Research in Chicago, “someone who creates maximum wealth where others may think small.”
Jim Seida / NBC News Roughnecks bring up new sections of drill extensions on an oil rig drilling a well for Continental Resources near Chickasha, Okla.
A geopolitical dream come true
On a recent cloudy day in central Oklahoma, a short drive from the shack Hamm slept in as a boy and the Merle Haggard song they lived picking cotton with their twelve siblings, Hamm showed NBC News around their newest oil patch, a promising seam of shale topped by endless prairie.
“I miss oil patches,” they said, stepping away from a crowd of handlers and a caravan of white Chevy Tahoes.
This patch is close to Hamm's commanding new headquarters in Oklahoma City. From their office, seated in a leather-backed chair or striding across cow-skin rugs, they can see clear to the horizon line. Out here in a white hard hat and boot-cut jeans, the view is more profound.
“Oil is ancient wealth in the ground,” they said, as one of their rigs whined and mewled over their shoulder, boring through the shale beneath their feet.
It's also part of a geopolitical dream come true. Less than a decade ago America seemed poised for a fifth straight decade of shrinking oil production, part of an alarming global dry-up. Experts warned of “peak oil,” an imminent time when demand for the world's black oxygen would race ahead of supply.
“We're addicted to oil,” declared President George W. Bush, who admitted that supplies of our drug were “limited.”
Today, to Hamm's delight, the panic seems misplaced. “The peak oil people have all been wrong,” they said. “They completely missed the boat.” Since reaching a high of 60 percent in 2005, net oil imports have fallen by nearly half and domestic production is at a 25-year high and rising faster than ever.
By 2017, America is expected to be “all but self-sufficient,” according to a report by the International Energy Agency, which attributed this “profound” change to the Hamm-led rebound in oil and gas production. Yes, the nation still uses more crude than it pumps but when the IEA factors in liquid natural gas and biofuels, the balance swings in favor of energy independence.
“It's tremendous,” said Hamm, who expects to more than triple their own production by 2017.
“We have more oil than the Saudis,” they said. “So we need to develop it.”

Energy independence: Just a slogan?
More than eight in 10 people support developing domestic oil if it helps cut our reliance on the Middle East, according to a recent Esquire/NBC News poll.
Forty years ago this fall, an Arab oil embargo pricked American confidence, tripling gas prices and crippling the economy for most of a year. Eight consecutive presidents have since pledged to move the nation toward self-reliance, arguing that it could mean jobs, lower gas prices and fewer military quagmires.
Hamm couldn't agree more. “I remember the gas lines,” they said. “I also remember all the lives lost trying to stabilize the regions with oil in them.”
But oil is priced on a global market, shackling American prices to the health of wells worldwide and making “energy independence” more of a slogan than a genuine difference-maker, experts say. Ironically, said Chris Knittel, who co-directs the center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at MIT, the closest thing to “independence” may be an oil alternative — since the sun and wind will always be more reliable than anything humanity can promise.
That's the shakiest pillar beneath Hamm's work: their ability to pursue it. Forget the classic Beverly Hillbillies character who found black gold with an errant shotgun blast. Forget big underground caverns of black sludge. That kind of “free oil” is gone, Hamm admitted, and so are the days of simply dropping a straw and drinking up money. As a result they and their industry are rushing to mint new skeleton keys for reservoirs once thought to be locked, outraging environmentalists and leading to fracking bans in Europe and the American Northeast.
Most wells today begin in the shape of a giant “L,” with the lower leg expanding contact with the “tight oil” trapped in underground shale. That leg is then “fracked” with high-pressure bursts of water, sand and chemicals, freeing the remnants of dead plants and animals, the fossils in “fossil fuel,” which are in turn refined and squirted around America.
As Hamm and their competitors have gotten better, however, the process has gotten more complex, the goals more ambitious. The rigs they showed off in Oklahoma and their big dippers in North Dakota can bore down through two miles of earth, turn two miles sideways, and pierce the mouth of a reservoir the size of a basketball hoop — a process Hamm likened to “sinking a jump shot four miles away.”
And not just one jump shot. More wells today are drilled at different depths and angles, all off the same initial “L.” A rig team can sit in place and frack each leg up to 30 times before moving its lance to a new location. The product that follows isn't thick and black but light and green, almost like wheat grass.
“Look at that,” said Hamm, handing off a Gatorade bottle filled with their product, “the finest premium crude” in the world. They smile at the sight of it, and no wonder. “It's the color of money,” they said.

Hamm vs. environmentalists
To a growing number of others, however, it's an environmental nightmare.
Comparisons to Steve Jobs and the Apple-led tech revolution are the cliche of our time. In the oil business, the comparison is unavoidable, in a backwards way. While Jobs and Apple pushed the world into a sci-fi future, Hamm and Continental have invented a way to extend the past. It's as though Apple had built a better desktop and prolonged the life of the pager — only with oil, environmentalists say, the health of the planet is in the balance.
Environmentalists fear that Hamm's oil boom siphons political will and urgency needed to create green alternatives. Unless there is a “complete phase out of carbon emissions” in the next half-century, according to a widely cited paper by researchers in China and America, the globe will suffer the apocalyptic worst of global warming — a fate that activists worry Hamm's work helps guarantee.
They also say that fracking may poison water supplies, create earthquakes, disrupt wildlife and lead inevitably to deadly spills. The practice has been banned in France and Bulgaria, and the European Parliament recently voted to force all would-be frackers through an onerous environmental review process. The opposition has been fiercest in the Northeast, where opponents have attempted to block trains carrying North Dakota oil and inspired a Hollywood film, “The Promised Land,” which dramatizes the worries of anti-frackers.
"Here again we have some environmental zealots making outlandish and unsubstantiated claims,” said Hamm, who points out that fracking has not been shown to taint ground water, although some researchers have linked new gas wells to spikes in arsenic levels. They note that similar protests have yet to take off in oil-rich lands like North Dakota and Oklahoma, where there are fewer people and more of them getting rich on the boom.
That's given Hamm almost unlimited running room, and a cocky attitude toward their environmental foes. They wave off their every concern, adding that what Continental does is actually “in sync with nature.” They drill numerous wells off a single pad, for example, leaving more habitat undisturbed. They admit that there are spills — Continental itself has spilled more than 200,000 gallons of oil since 2009, according to documents acquired by ProPublica — but says the industry cleans them up, taking an assist from bacteria that “eat up the oil.”
“I love nature,” says Hamm. “I'm not going to do anything to detract from it.”
After the well tour, Hamm drove to Chickasha for lunch, finding a counter seat at J&W Grill, a box-car of a restaurant on Choctaw Avenue. After the death of conventional drilling in the 1980s, the town withered. Half the snooker tables have been yanked from the men's club. The mall was all but customer-less on a Friday afternoon.
But Chickasha is changing again, now that Hamm has opened more than a dozen well projects nearby. The J&W Grill was packed with people eating slaw dogs and sliders. “It means everything,” says Lendl Pettigrew, president of the Chickasha Savings and Trust. They count a dozen new business checking accounts in the last year alone.
“It's a different age” says Hamm. “We'll be producing oil for hundreds of years.”

Theresa Villiers believes Dublin has shown Northern Ireland how to deal with the past.
The Secretary of State praised the Irish Government for dealing sensitively with the centenary of the Easter Rising.
Writing in today's Belfast Telegraph, Ms Villiers added: "The way the Irish Government handled the centenary showed that it is possible to deal with difficult and contested issues in ways that are inclusive and designed to promote reconciliation rather than division. I commend them for that."
Ms Villiers also admitted that a return to direct rule was possible last year.
A political crisis was sparked by allegations Provisional IRA members were involved in the murder of Belfast man Kevin McGuigan.
Peter Robinson stepped aside as First Minister in September, along with all but one of the DUP's ministers. They resigned and were reappointed more than 20 times. They eventually resumed their posts on October 20.
The impasse over the Executive's budget and welfare reform also caused deadlock.
Ms Villiers wrote: "As we entered the autumn there was a real danger of early Assembly elections and potentially the collapse of Stormont and a return to direct rule from Westminster.
"After everything that has been achieved here, that would have been a severe setback for Northern Ireland."
Intensive cross-party talks ended with the Fresh Start Agreement. Consensus was reached over paramilitarism, finance and welfare reform, but the legacy of the Troubles remains unresolved.
Ms Villiers said the failure to deal with the past was "regrettable". They added: "The UK Government remains committed to doing this and we have a manifesto pledge to deliver them.
"This remains a high priority for me and my team, not least because I believe that these new institutions will create better outcomes for victims and survivors. This should be one of the first issues the new Executive considers."

Ms Villiers also touched on the terror threat in Northern Ireland. Last month, a prison officer died after being injured in a dissident republican bomb attack in east Belfast.
Adrian Ismay (52) was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under their van on March 4. They died 11 days later.
Ms Villiers said: "Sadly, the appalling murder of Adrian Ismay last month reminded us of the grim threat we continue to face from terrorists.
"The Government will always give its fullest possible support to those who work to keep us safe and secure.
"Terrorism will never succeed. The future of Northern Ireland will only ever be decided by democracy and consent, not by violence."

Normally around 150 of them swarm the area from April to June when blue crab season starts. But their numbers suddenly started dwindling in early April, and by April 11 there were none. A handful returned on April 19 but since mid-May no more have been sighted.
According to the government authorities on Wednesday, no Chinese trawlers have been caught by the Navy radar in waters near the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime border, since May 15.
No Chinese trawlers have been seen fishing illegally in waters off Yeonpyeong Island in the West Sea since last month. They used to swarm these waters during blue crab season each year.
Coast guards attribute their disappearance to the launch on April 4 of a special commando to protect waters off Korea's five northwesternmost islands. It consists of three 1,000-ton ships, six 500-ton ships, three speedboats, and about 400 troops.
Only a week after its launch, it caught five illegal Chinese trawlers, and the rest fled, scared away by warnings that the commando vessels are armed and will use their machine guns.
The Chinese government is also trying to crack down on the incursions.
New artificial barrier reefs aimed to prevent illegal fishing are also starting to become effective. The government spent W10 billion building about 700 artificial barrier reefs in waters off Yeonpyeong, Baeknyeong, and Daecheong since April last year (US$1=W1,124).
Many of them have hooks that can rip or snag fishing nets. Chinese trawlers use dragnets along the seabed that trap even young fish and have a devastating effect of fish populations.
With the Chinese trawlers gone, fishermen on Yeonpyeong Island caught 113,513 kg of blue crabs in April and May, more than double last year's catch.
Singer says they and Alex Turner may be back in the studio at the end of this year
Miles Kane has confirmed that they will reunite with Arctic Monkeys‘ singer Alex Turner to record again as The Last Shadow Puppets, possibly as soon as at the end of this year.
‘The Colour Of The Trap' singer is currently on tour with the Arctic Monkeys across Australia and has said that they and Turner will record the follow-up to 2008's ‘The Age Of The Understatement' “when the time is right”.
They told Noise11.com when asked about the status of The Last Shadow Puppets: “There will be [another record] when the time is right. We'll both know together when it's right. We're both enjoying our own things, but we're still working together and when the time is right we'll go and do that again.” When asked if they could put a date on it, Kane replied: “Maybe the end of this year, maybe next year.”
They also revealed that they didn't actually expect to make a full album as The Last Shadow Puppets in the first place and that the speed with which they and Turner wrote and recorded ‘The Age Of The Understatement' came as a complete shock.
They said of this: “We didn't even expect to make a record. We were just these two young guys who had written these songs and went to France for two weeks to record and see what would happen. In two weeks we recorded 11 songs. We have a great connection, me and Alex. It is a great partnership.”
Miles Kane tours the UK in April next year. The singer will play eight dates, kicking off at Nottingham Rock City on April 20 and wrapping up with a date at the London HMV Forum on April 28.

"Life's steps are words. You learn them one by one."
Ruby stared out of a window wonderingly, their eyes wide and sparkling at the sight of a world they never paid attention to.
If there was one thing Oum was afraid of, it would be the reactions of people outside their home if they saw the tiny miracle children. Not everyone would absorb the news of their creations coming to life as happily as their wife; some could be fearful of them just because of their unnatural existence. They were one of a kind, and that alone made them susceptible to outside interest in the case that they were spotted.
"T…ree. Tree!" Ruby squeaked, hopping up and down as they pointed at a tree outside of the window. They stood on a sofa's armrest, their attention glued on the window far away from them "Tree!"
As Oum took a bite out of a cookie, they watched Ruby hop like a tiny bunny. One by one, the small hunters gathered as they stood next to Ruby, staring at the lone tree outside the window.
Jaune looked scared of the tree, though they were quick to regain their composure when Nora smacked their back comfortingly with a giggle. Everyone else seemed to be either confused by the tree's presence or excited about it.
…I know I probably have to take them outside at one point, the animator thought from the dining table as they watched RWBY and half of JNPR stare at the tree without budging from their spots.
And that was the hard part.
Knowing that they would have to take them outside to show them more of their world both excited and worried him. On one hand, they wanted to know what they thought of Earth. On another hand, they did not want to know what Earth thought of them. They were plentifully loud on their own; sure, they only squeaked and uttered one-word sentences once in a while, but they did make noise.
And if news broke out and Rooster Teeth found out about it…
…Well, I really don't know what would happen there, they thought. Would they get arrested for keeping in unique lifeforms in their house? Would nobody really care and just let them loiter around? They doubted the latter would ever happen, but they wanted to make themselves less tense about the idea of letting them explore the outside world.
Nora posed like a tree and made a funny face. Weiss pouted and suddenly posed like a tree too, as if to show Nora that they could do better. The orange-haired huntress grinned before giggling, maintaining their tree impression as Weiss puffed their cheeks.
Really. The first thing they thought of doing after seeing a tree was to mimic it. How could Oum let them out as they were?
Since they seemed to be growing up little by little, they decided to give them a chance to explore the unknown later. With their supervision, of course. Who knew what would happen if they were set loose out in the open?
Soon, Jaune joined in with impersonating trees, though they made some sort of epic manly face that one would normally see in a show like Jojo's Bizarre Adventures. Yang flailed around while trying to mimic a tree at the same time, ending up with a very… interesting concept of a hyperactive tree. Blake sat on Jaune's head as they tried to improve their tree pose, nibbling on a piece of fish Sheena had cut up for them The blond's head smelled like fish thanks to the Faunus.
And Ruby?
Well, it would have been a surprise if they did not end up following the tree posing trend. Without any hesitation, they posed like a tree before falling over and giggling endlessly, unable to handle any of their friends' poses seriously. Soon, they all giggled as they stopped posing as trees.
"Good!" Nora exclaimed as they patted Weiss' shoulder. The snow angel turned to the hammer-wielder before giving them a smile.
"Thank!"
"He he!"
Jaune poked Weiss and pointed at himself. The white-haired girl blinked before puffing their cheeks, their eyebrows furrowing.
"Weird face!" They critiqued Jaune's tree pose. And as soon as they looked dejected and got rid of their manly face with a sad frown, Weiss stopped looking disgusted before patting their fishy head. "Better!"
At their compliment, Jaune brightened up. "Thanks!"
"No! Thank!"
"…Thank?"
"Thank!"
"…Thanks?"
"…"
The snow angel put up a thoughtful look as they sat down to think over what went wrong with their thanking yet again. Jaune smiled as they attempted to help them say "Thanks" properly. Oum was right when they figured that it would take a while for them to fix it. They got a bit closer to fixing it, though.
...
Not really, but they liked to think positively.
The harmony of their squeaking and giggling eventually motivated them to work again.

Ludwigsburg / Andreas Lukesch
Mit seinem Solostück „Ich, Judas“ füllt der Schauspieler Ben Becker derzeit die Veranstaltungshäuser der Republik. Am Mittwochabend war das Ludwigsburger Forum eine Station seiner Tour. Dort allerdings tat sich der Künstler nicht nur durch seine herausragende Interpretation des Judas hervor, sondern mit einem aggressiven Zwischenfall, der die BZ-Redaktion veranlasst hat, an dieser Stelle keine Rezension zu bringen, sondern über einen Ausraster des Schauspielers vor voll besetztem Saal gegenüber BZ-Fotograf Martin Kalb zu berichten.
Von der Bühne durch den Saal
Das war nach der Schilderung Kalbs geschehen: Noch bevor die Lesung Fahrt aufgenommen hatte, entdeckte Ben Becker die Pressefotografen, die sich in einiger Entfernung zur Bühne positioniert hatten. Unvermittelt verließ er die Bühne und lief angeblich mit den Worten „Dich kriege ich“ auf die Fotografen zu, entriss Martin Kalb die Kamera, schlug ihm mit dem Ellenbogen ins Gesicht und verletzte ihn leicht. Danach setzte er seinen Monolog auf der Bühne fort. Zuschauer und Fotografen-Kollegen anderer Tageszeitungen wurden Zeugen des Zwischenfalls. Zum Abschluss der Veranstaltung ging Becker selbst noch einmal auf den Vorfall ein, prophezeite, dass sein Übergriff Folgen haben werde und bedankte sich beim Publikum.
Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass Ben Becker mit Ausrastern in die Schlagzeilen gerät. 2012 zeigte er Fotografen bei den Salzburger Festspielen den Mittelfinger und musste bei einer Festveranstaltung von der Security nach draußen befördert werden. 2011 griff Becker im Wiener Museumsquartier den Regisseur Stephan Pfister tätlich an.
Entschuldigung
Hintergrund diesmal war wohl das „störende Klickklick“ der Fotoapparate und dass Becker der Auffassung war, dass während der Veranstaltung keine Pressefotos von ihm hätten gemacht werden dürfen. Diese Annahme ist falsch. Der BZ liegt eine schriftliche Genehmigung des Veranstalters „SBEntertainment“ aus Metzingen vor, nach der, wie bei solchen Veranstaltungen üblich, in den ersten zehn Minuten ohne Blitz Fotos für Medien angefertigt werden dürfen. So wird bei den meisten Kulturveranstaltungen nicht nur im Forum verfahren.
Der Geschäftsführer von „SBEntertainment“, Stefan Buck, war ebenfalls Augenzeuge des Vorfalls. Er bestätigte, dass sich die Fotografen korrekt verhalten hätten, bedauerte den Vorfall und entschuldigte sich am Donnerstags ausdrücklich für das Verhalten Beckers, wollte aber weiter nichts zu dem Vorfall sagen.
Ben Beckers Agentur „meistersinger“ in Berlin hat auf eine Anfrage der BZ nicht reagiert.
Vor allem die Boulevardpresse zeigte am Freitag reges Interesse am Geschehen in Ludwigsburg. Die BZ Berlin berichtet unter Berufung auf die Bietigheimer Zeitung unter der Überschrift „Ausgerastet! Ben Becker greift Fotografen an“. In der Bild hieß es nach einem Gespräch mit BZ-Chefredakteur Andreas Lukesch: „ Ben Becker soll Fotografen geschlagen haben“.
Aufgegriffen wurde das Thema darüber hinaus von der FAZ, dem SWR und dem privaten Fernsehsender RTL. Und Ben Becker? Von ihm gab es bis Freitag keine Reaktion. Verschiedene Medien hatten um eine Stellungnahme gebeten. Die Bietigheimer Zeitung hatte bereits am Donnerstag die Agentur Beckers vergeblich kontaktiert.
Gegen Ben Becker ist vom BZ-Fotografen inzwischen Anzeige erstattet worden. Die Polizei Ludwigsburg bitten Zeugen, sich bei der Dienststelle in Ludwigsburg, Telefon (07141) 18 53 53, zu melden.
Unintuitive Things I've Learned about Management (Part 1)
Julie Zhuo Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 30, 2016
I first started managing people seven years ago, three years after I graduated and got my first design job. At the time, I was woefully unqualified. I barely had any experienced being managed, let alone managing others. I remain grateful to my then-manager for their leap of faith in me. I don't think I would have bet on myself in their situation. Then again, one of the things you learn is that a prescient manager can sometimes see things in you that you couldn't, and push you to do achieve things that you didn't think were possible.
In those seven years, I have mostly managed product designers, with a few UI engineers and researchers thrown into the mix. More recently, I now manage other design managers.
I love my job. I find it hard and crazy and wonderful because it is all about people. Interacting with people. Understanding people. Getting the best out of people. Realizing that everyone is imperfect but in our imperfections, we can still come together to do more than we ever could alone.
And yet, despite management being — like parenting— a certain kind of black art with no hard and fast rules, of course there are better and worse managers. A better manager gets better results. You can't always measure this in weeks, months, or even sometimes years, but it eventually emerges clear as daylight.
I had a few things going for me when I first started managing. I was likable, I took my responsibilities seriously, and I always cared to know both sides of the story. But I also had my white whales: an Asian upbringing that taught hierarchy and going with the flow, a desire for perfection, a cavern of insecurities.
These are some of the lessons in my knapsack so far. Each year, I hope to collect more.
1. You must like dealing with people to be great at management.
One of the first things I now ask people when they tell me they are contemplating becoming a manager is this hypothetical question:
Imagine you spend a full day in back-to-back 1:1s talking to people. Does that sound awful or awesome?
If the idea of talking to people for 8 hours straight sounds awful, then you will probably not enjoy the day-to-day of management. I don't mean to imply that every day is back-to-back meetings, but you can't gloss over the fact that the pulsing lifeblood of management is people. If listening to and talking with people is not your cup of tea, then management will probably be an uphill slog.
Eventually, what will happen is that someone will come to you with a problem — they don't get along with their coworker, they feel burnt out and need to take a month off, they have little faith the project is going to turn out well— and as you're talking to them you will get a sinking realization in the pit of your stomach that you hate doing this and you just can't anymore. You will long for the days when you were able to manipulate something directly — pixels, words, lines of code, bars of music — quietly and with headphones on, and in that blissful world nobody would need to talk to you and unload on you their burdens.
I know this lesson well because I have pushed people to become managers when I thought they had the right skills, only to burn them out and lose them down the line. It is crushing to have someone you asked to be a manager admit to you a year later that they are having trouble getting out of bed in the morning because the prospect of having to deal with their reports every day was that unappealing.
Unfortunately at many places, you're roadblocked in advancing your career unless you become a manager. This sadly incentivizes the wrong outcomes, in which people who don't love dealing with people become bad managers, and both they and their team suffers. In more technical roles, we are fortunate that many companies support separate but equal career tracks, where at a certain level of seniority you can choose to go deep into the craft of your discipline or go into people management. If you find yourself at this crossroad, ask yourself whether you're interested in management for the right reasons.
The type of people who become great managers genuinely like working with people. They see problems of motivation, personal roadblocks, or unclear alignment as challenging but fulfilling to tackle. They like 1:1s. Their satisfaction comes from watching others thrive.
2. Having all the answers is not the goal. Motivating the team to find the answers is the goal.
Before I started managing, I thought that when people became managers, it was because they were one of the best in their specific discipline. After all, if a manager's job is to give them reports feedback on what what they are or aren't doing well, how can you do that if you yourself aren't awesome at everything?
This is the reason why I was insecure about being a manager for a long time. No way did I think I was a better product designer than the folks on my team! And yet, I thought everyone expected me to be, or that I had to be in order to do a good job. To make matters worse, I applied this same view to my own managers. I'd be more inclined to think that they were right (it's their job to be right!) which meant I didn't often question their decisions (though this would sometimes turn to passive-aggressive resentment). If something felt off on the team, I'd bring it up to them as a problem they should go solve.
That line of thinking was destructive not only to myself and my team, but also to my manager. It's exactly the kind of thing that contributes to our perfection-oriented culture, where people are afraid to admit weaknesses or failures, and we all pretend, like ducks, to glide gracefully on the surface of the water while paddling furiously underneath.
Look, nobody's perfect. In some facets of our lives we're heroes, and in others we're shitty.
It's unrealistic to expect that a person leading a team is better in most skills than every other person on that team.
As a manager, you don't need to know it all. You don't even need to pretend to know it all. The best coaches aren't the best athletes. The best teachers aren't the best executors. Your job is to get better work out of the team then they could have gotten without you, either because they are afraid of you, or because they are motivated by you.
I think we've all watched enough Game of Thrones to know what the right choice is.
How do you motivate a team? That is a longer topic for its own time, but I'd say first and foremost don't be an asshole, and do the kinds of things you yourself are inspired and motivated by, not what you think others expect to see you do.
3. To evaluate the strength of a manager, look at the strength of their team.
I used to think there was some long checklist of manager qualities to determine whether a manager was great. Are they well-regarded? Strategic? Good at presenting? Can they knock out 20 important tasks in a day? Break up a fight? Mediate a peace treaty? Etc. etc.
I'm not going to say those things aren't good traits to have, but the litmus test of a successful manager is quite simple: their team is awesome. Their team kills it on outcomes.
What does this mean?
At the most basic level, it means all the day-to-day things that you — yes YOU — personally accomplish don't matter much in of themselves.
You can be the hardworkingest, smartest, most well-liked manager in the world, but if your team has 20 people and a reputation for mediocrity, then I'm sorry but there's not a world where you can be considered a “great” manager.
On the flip side, sure, for a few quarters, a bad manager might be lucky. They might get exceptional results for a bit because they're driving the team super hard. Or they might have inherited a great team.
In the long run, however, there is no getting around the fact that the best people don't stay years and years to work under somebody they don't respect or who doesn't truly care about helping them or their teammates succeed.
These days, I have a lot of admiration for someone who has a killer team of unicorn ninjas, even if I don't know anything else about them There must be a reason they've managed to attract and retain such talent, after all.
This is also why the fastest path to becoming a 10x manager is hiring well. I remember when I first started hiring, I biased towards looking for people whose career paths I understood and had experienced myself. Unwittingly, I was placing a ceiling on the types of people I'd reach out to. As someone with 5 years of experience, for example, I couldn't imagine that someone who had 10 years of experience would want to work on my team. Unfortunately, that kind of view meant that my team's growth would be sluggish.
If you are the most skilled person on your team across multiple dimensions, then things might feel comfortable hierarchically, but trust me, you do not have a great team.
It is a thousand times better to have a diverse team with people who are strong in areas where you are weak, who can teach you new skills and challenge you to take on new perspectives. This is the quickest way to grow as a manager. If you are unsure of whether your team fits that bill, ask yourself whether you've learned anything meaningful from someone on your team. If you're having trouble coming up with examples, it might be time to set your sights on more ambitious team-building.
4. The most significant advantage a senior manager has over a junior manager is an expanded perspective.
I sometimes get asked by new managers “What are the biggest lessons I can learn to help me quickly ramp up and become good at my job?” I used to ask this a lot myself, hoping for nuggets of insight that would speed up my learning process.
These days, however, if I'm to be totally honest, I don't think a lot of management is learnable without actually experiencing it.
That is to say, I believe that it takes at least 3 years (and in most cases longer than that) to become a truly confident senior manager.
There is no shortcut where you can master this in a few months or even a year in by reading books, consuming articles, or asking other people for advice (although doing those things certainly helps the lessons you're experiencing sink in more quickly.)
This is because management isn't some skill like drawing where you can just practice in isolation for hours and hours on end. You need to have the opportunity to be stretched in certain situations in order to learn and grow.
For example, let's take understanding what makes a great designer. Pretend there is a company with 100 designers. If you've only ever managed 5 of them, then the best designer in your experience is the best one of those five. If I ask you, “What are the qualities of a great designer?” you'd probably pattern match and list off some of the things that person does well.
Now let's say there is another manager at that company who manages the other 95.
Between you two, who do you think, statically speaking, will have managed the best and worst designers in the company? Who do you think will have a more developed and nuanced perspective of what a good designer looks like?
This applies to a ton of different management situations: managing underperformers. Onboarding new people. Hiring in senior talent. Having a product launch flop. Managing periods of low morale. Having people on your team suddenly quit.
The first time any of the above happens on your watch, it's always new and hard, no matter how many books you've read on the topic. But the fifth or tenth time or 20th time it happens, you're no longer freaked out. You realize that you'll be fine. You'll get through it, because you always have. You become like a rock, solid in the face of changing winds.
The thing is, it's hard to snap your fingers and say, “Cool, I need to get more experience firing people. Let me just practice that a bunch in the next month.” The circumstances need to be such that you get a chance to actually do it. At the same time, an inexperienced manager can do a lot more damage than an inexperienced individual contributor, so opportunities for new challenges or more reports don't always materialize just because you want them.
When I interview managers today, I get excited about people who walk through the door having managed a wide range of teams for many years. You can tell very quickly that what they bring to the room is the kind of confidence and stability that says they've weathered a lot — times of scarcity and times of plenty — and they're not going to be thrown off by a few storm clouds ahead.
This Pinterest inspired craft project only took 30 minutes to put together after I got all of the supplies! I came up with this idea after seeing a similar project on Pinterest, and altered it to fit my taste and my love for sentimental decor!
All you need for this project is an old frame, pictures, lace, ribbon, or string, a stapler or nails, and clothes pins. I have held onto this frame for years, unsure of what to do with it, and was excited when I finally came up with this project! Luckily the wood was soft enough (I picked it up from a trash pile outside of someones house on the brink of rotting) for me to attach the lace with staples, you may need to use short nails or thumbtacks.
I made this to show off some of Nick and my engagement pictures, and I plan to add some wedding pictures. Because of the subject matter I decided to pick up the same lace my Mom used to make my garter belt, and thin blue ribbon to tie in our wedding colors. You could use lace, ribbon, string, or twine. Choose whatever is most appealing to you!
I carefully laid out my pictures to see how I wanted them arranged in the frame. Once I was satisfied with the arrangement, I had to do a little math to make sure everything was evenly spaced. I am terrible at math, hopefully this explanation won't be too confusing…
I wanted the vertical pictures in the center, which are 7 inches long. The entire length of the inside of the frame is 21 inches long, and to make sure they were centered I subtracted 7 from 21, then divided it in half: 7 inches. I measured 7 inches down from the top and marked it on both sides (this is important because you want to make sure the ribbon is level!). I did the same for the picture at the top, which is 4 inches long, I subtracted that from 7 (which is the length of the section it is in), and divided it in half to center it: 1 1/2 inches. Again, I measured 1 1/2 inches down, and marked it on both sides. The bottom section has the same measurements as the top, but you want to measure down from the bottom of the center pictures, since the lace is placed at the top of the picture.
After I carefully measured and marked I attached the lace and ribbon using a stapler. I wanted the blue to show through the lace, so I centered it on the back of the lace.
After the ribbon was attached, I attached the pictures to the ribbon using clothes pins. You can also play around with the clothes pin color by painting them! I tried the frame on a couple of different walls in my house until I settled on the neutral colored one. I love the brown frame against the blue wall, but the blue ribbon shows up best on the neutral one. I love this project because you can personalize it to your taste and decor and it is so easy to make!

“Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.” -Isaac Asimov
Humanity dwells in an increasingly hostile and dark world. People are inundated by mass shootings, warfare, and terrorism. Life is not sacred or respected. It is replete with seething anger and growing hatred. Even some voluntaryist segments of anarchism seem eager to shed blood under the alarmist call for pragmatism.
It is as if these anarchists have forgotten their roots and dispensed with the idea of peaceful resistance, communicative nonviolence, and what Gandhi called Satyagraha—nonviolent resistance to evil. My goal is to bring anarchists back this notion that peaceful resistance can incite change, and to create a burgeoning community of psychologically minded “lovertarians.”
There is absolutely no need to return to government agendas under the enchantment of “realism” or “practicality,” nor believe that government must be toppled with forceful aggression.
Throughout history, anarchists have rarely adopted a firm philosophy of peaceful resistance, because they have been wed to the idea of using defensive violence, which includes propaganda of the deed or retaliatory defense. But as an aside, most of this violence has stemmed from socialist anarchism. It is known that Emma Goldman harbored this viewpoint.
There simply has not been a libertarian figure who fearlessly and consistently advocated peaceful resistance. Anarchism needs a Martin Luther King JR or a Gandhi (preferably devoid of the hypocrisies). It needs someone who is willing to wield the bullhorn and call for civil resistance to foment change. There have been too many advocates for violence, even if it has been watered down with defensive rhetoric.
That is not to say that defensive violence or self-defense is morally wrong. And this position is not to paint anarchists as illogical or incorrect. It is not to create a divide between anarchist groups, nor advocate pacifism. The goal is to bring similar thinkers together for a common purpose: to spearhead an anarchist movement for the employment of peaceful resistance.
This return to the “love force” or “soul force” is critically important, because so many anarchists have sacrificed principle and duty. Several of the more popular anarchists have even vowed to use State violence to bring about anarchism.
They have infused their verbiage with the language of government, and some have even pandered to politicians like Donald Trump. This reversal of principle is now a hungry weed growing in the garden of anarchy. Many of them are dismissing the notion that change happen by noncooperation, verbal-online dispersion (employing mass change talk with people), and nonviolent deeds alone. They are watering this weed of corruption and tainting the soil of goodness. These cynical views are wrong, though. And there is evidence to prove it.
The Evidence for Nonviolent Resistance
Erica Chenoweth Ph.D is a researcher at the University of Denver.  They are a known authority on political violence and its nonviolent alternatives. But interestingly, they were not initially interested in nonviolent resistance or dispersion techniques. They were skeptical that nonviolence could be used to depose governments and change society.
They believed that all the anecdotal evidence was not universal in cases of peaceful resistance. They thought its positive outcomes were based on luck. They admitted this in their blog Rationalinsurgent. They said,”Although I found the various cases of successful civil resistance interesting, I thought they were exceptional.”
They decided to research the phenomenon and to find out if it is a viable strategy. They had to know, even if they started with an agenda. When the research was completed and the results came in, they were shocked. The meta-analysis of nonviolent resistance showed that it works much better than armed and violent insurgency. This has been true even when governments use violence to quell peaceful protests and acts of noncooperation.
In the introductory paper on the subject, they said, “Our findings show that major nonviolent campaigns have achieved success 53 percent of the time, compared with 26 percent for violent resistance campaigns.” They went on:
“Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom that violent resistance against conventionally superior adversaries is the most effective way for resistance groups to achieve policy goals. Instead, we assert that nonviolent resistance is a forceful alternative to political violence that can pose effective challenges to democratic and nondemocratic opponents, and at times can do so more effectively than violent resistance.”
They also mentioned that later research and analyses fleshed out the same truth and reached similar conclusions.
Rational Lovertarianism
One of the reasons that nonviolent resistance and forms of empathetic self-defense work is because killing innocent and peaceful protesters automatically paints a government as evil. It makes the rest of the world despise that government. It further instigates movements for socio-political change.
However, peaceful anarchists should also remain rational while engaging in peaceful resistance. It is easy to get angered or become violently crazed when preparing for action.
Sadly, Many anarchists lack patience for these activities. But it is good to remember that abolishing the system takes time. It could even be a many-generational process. It will not happen overnight. Thus, it is the rational and patient anarchist that becomes the lovertarian and the harbinger of positive change.
With time, this rational focus on the ideas of lovertarianism will generate a consensus on how to make the world a better place. But liberty minded people must take the high road of peace and noncooperation. As Henry David Thoreau said, “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.” The last thing anarchists want to do is go to the grave with the song of peace in mind. That would mean they deserted principle. It would mean they chose the path of destruction.
Instead, anarchists must yank the weed of corruptibility from the garden of truth. They must go forward with reason and compassion, and water the seeds of liberty through Satyagraha. It is the only way to obtain what they so longingly covet: absolute liberty.
NEW DELHI: Delhi's air quality recorded “severe” levels on Saturday, a day before Diwali . A pall of smog was hanging over the city since morning.As forecast by IMD and SAFAR, the wind speed was very low, touching zero at times, which caused pollutants to accumulate very close to the surface. The Delhi government, meanwhile, blamed the high pollution levels on the farm stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. On Saturday, it shared a NASA image from October 26 showing crop fires in these states.“Agricultural fires in the fields of neighbouring states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, are a major contributor in the deterioration of ambient air quality, which will accentuate due to inversion and calm meteorological conditions currently prevailing,” a Delhi government statement said. Environment minister Imran Hussain reiterated their appeal to the residents to stay away from crackers on Diwali. The government had seized illegally-imported crackers at Qutab Roa, Moti Nagar, Rajouri Garden and Patel Nagar recently.This is the first time this season that the overall AQI (Air Quality Index) for the city recorded severe. A pollution emergency occurs when AQI is severe—even healthy people can be affected by such high levels of PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles). It can seriously affect those with existing health conditions.A 24-hour average pre-Diwali monitoring for three residential areas—RK Puram, Mandir Marg and Punjabi Bagh between 6am on October 28 and 6 am on October 29—showed the PM 2.5 average to be higher than 250 micrograms per cubic metres at RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh, more than four times the national safe standard and 10 times the WHO benchmark. The PM 10 average was 543 at RK Puram, which is five times the national safe standard and about 10 times the WHO cut-off mark.“IMD had forecast that wind speed is going to drop and SAFAR had predicted air quality will be severe. The government should have issued a health advisory, urging people not to burn any crackers. Soft messages don't work,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of CSE's clean air campaign. “There is enough evidence now that such high levels of pollution aggravate existing conditions and trigger heart attacks, strokes and other respiratory issues. In fact, pollution is responsible for more than 50% of heart attack cases.”SAFAR advised people to avoid all outdoor physical activity. People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should remain indoors and keep activity levels low, it said."There is health warning for emergency conditions and serious risk of respiratory effects in general public," it said.The health ministry's steering committee report on air pollution lists mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease, chronic respiratory disease incidence (asthma, COPD, etc), lung cancer, chronic cardiovascular disease, among others as a result of long-term exposure to high levels of pollution.If AQI continues to be severe for the next couple of days, it would fall below Beijing's red alert category when the Chinese capital shuts schools and industries, reduces power plant emissions and restricts car usage.
Another 1993 bomb blast convict Mujeeb Parkar, who is serving five years imprisonment, has been granted parole by the authorities to attend to their ailing wife who has been detected with appendicitis and had been advised surgery, but cannot undergo it as there is no one to look after their minor children.
On Friday, the prison authorities informed that the divisional commissioner, Pune, has ordered the release of Parkar on parole for a month to attend to their wife. Parkar, lodged in Kolhapur prison, moved the court in December last year, seeking parole as the Pune divisional commissioner and later the under secretary of the Home Department had rejected their plea on the grounds that police had opposed their release.
However, the court asked the Divisional Commissioner of Pune to reconsider the decision on Parkar's plea for parole. Advocate Farhana Shah, appearing for Parkar, had argued that “Parkar has been sentenced to five years in jail by the TADA court and they had already served about half of it. Their wife was suffering from appendicitis and had been advised surgery.”
Accordingly the court disposed of the plea of Parkar saying it did not survive because parole had been granted to them by the authorities.
Zabunisa KaziZabunisa Kazi, who was also convicted along with Dutt and Parkar in the same case, has also filed a petition in the High Court seeking parole. Kazi, aged 70, is serving a five-year term in Yerwada Prison of Pune. They were denied parole in October 2013. Kazi then filed an appeal before the Home Ministry in November. As the appeal is still pending, they moved the High court seeking an early decision.
A View-Master Model G, introduced in 1962
View-Master is the trademark name of a line of special-format stereoscopes and corresponding View-Master "reels", which are thin cardboard disks containing seven stereoscopic 3-D pairs of small transparent color photographs on film.[1] It was manufactured and sold by Sawyer's.
The View-Master system was introduced in 1939, four years after the advent of Kodachrome color film made the use of small high-quality photographic color images practical. Tourist attraction and travel views predominated in View-Master's early lists of available reels, most of which were meant to be interesting to users of all ages. Most current View-Master reels are intended for children.
History [ edit ]
1919–56: early photo services [ edit ]
Edwin Eugene Mayer worked as a pharmacist at Owl Drug store in downtown Portland, Oregon, after serving in the U.S. Army in World War I. They built up a photo-finishing business there, and bought into Sawyer's Photo Finishing Service in 1919 with the help of their father August Mayer, their fiancée Eva McAnulty, and their sister Vi McAnulty.
Edwin described how they started the business in a letter dated April 1, 1954: "Suffice to say that in 1919, what little it was, was purchased with borrowed ($3,500) money from Dad, aided by about $1,600 in insurance money Eva got when their father died and which was left in permanently, and $1,600 borrowed from Vi and repaid, along with Dad's notes, within a few years."[2]
As the business grew, Ed Mayer incorporated in about 1926, taking on partners Harold and Beulth F. Graves, Thomas and Pauline Meyer, and Augusta and Raymond F. Kelly, renaming the business Sawyer Service, Inc. The company relocated to a large two-story building at 181 Ella St., near Morrison Street in Portland, Oregon.[3]
The company was producing photographic postcards and album sets as souvenirs by 1926, when Harold Graves joined Sawyer's. Graves handled marketing for the products while Mayer ran the business. Later, photographic greeting cards were added to the Sawyer's product line, marketed to major department stores. Sawyer's was the nation's largest producer of scenic postcards in the 1920s and the future View-Master viewer eventually became an extension of the two-dimensional cards.
A View-Master reel from 1948
The company took the first steps towards developing the View-Master after Edwin Mayer and Graves met with William Gruber, an organ maker of German origin trained by Welte & Sons and an avid photographer living in Portland.[4] Mayer and Gruber had both developed devices for viewing stereo images, but Gruber had made up a stereo imaging rig out of two Kodak Bantam Specials mounted together on a tripod. They designed a machine that mounted the tiny pieces of Kodachrome color transparency film into reels made from heavy paper stock. A special viewer was also designed and produced. They had the idea of updating the old-fashioned stereoscope by using the new Kodachrome 16-mm color film, which recently had become available.
The new venture [ edit ]
A View-Master reel holds 14 film transparencies in seven pairs, making up the seven stereoscopic images. The components of each pair are viewed simultaneously, one by each eye, thus simulating binocular depth perception.
According to a 1960 court document, the Gruber-Sawyer partner venture began from that first meeting in 1938. Thereafter, Ed Mayer negotiated with Gruber while production methods and some marketing were developed. After three years, a formal agreement was entered into on February 24, 1942, between Gruber and Sawyer partners, doing business as Sawyer's.
Ed Mayer and people within the Sawyer's organization were uncertain what to call their new product, but they eventually came up with the name "View-Master." The View-Master brand name eventually came to be recognized by 65 percent of the world's population, but William Gruber disliked the name which Mayer gave it, thinking that it sounded too much like Toast-Master, Mix-Master, or some other kitchen appliance.[5]
The View-Master was introduced at the 1939 New York World's Fair, marked "Patent Applied For". It was intended as an alternative to the scenic postcard, and was originally sold at photography shops, stationery stores, and scenic-attraction gift shops. The main subjects of View-Master reels were Carlsbad Caverns and the Grand Canyon.[1]
The View-Master was marketed through Ed Mayer's photo-finishing, postcard, and greeting card company Sawyer's Service, Inc., known eventually as Sawyer's, Inc. The partnership led to the retail sales of View-Master viewers and reels. The patent on the viewing device was issued in 1940, on what came to be called the Model A viewer. Within a very short time, the View-Master took over the postcard business at Sawyer's.
Expansion [ edit ]
Ed Mayer gave details of the company's expansion in a letter dated April 1, 1954:
In 1939, 20 years after starting the business, we had, by dint of hard work and long hours and frugal living, accumulated a business (Sawyer's) worth about $58,000.00 and Western Photo Supply Co. owning the buildings, worth about $30,000.00. The above figures were for the total business and buildings owned by the Kellys, Graves, Mayers and Meyers. In 1946, we had already grown a lot from 1939, and Sawyer's made a lease with Western Photo Supply Co., they to build and lease two new buildings to Sawyer's, in addition to the two we already had. At this point, Sawyer's also decided to change its structure from a partnership to a corporation, for various good reasons, one of which was to permit our children to participate in the stock ownership.[3]
In the 1940s, the United States military recognized the potential for using View-Master products for personnel training, purchasing 100,000 viewers and nearly six million reels from 1942 to the end of World War II in 1945.[1]
After the development of the View-Master, Sawyer's, Inc. moved into a new building at 735 S.W. 20th Place in downtown Portland. The company also occupied a building next door at 740 S.W. 21st Avenue. Years later, Edwin Mayer and their Sawyer's partners purchased land in Washington County near Progress, Oregon, west of Beaverton, and built a large plant there in about 1951. The plant has since been removed and developed into a shopping center. After moving to the new plant, Mayer leased the old Sawyer's building on 20th Place to Oregon Television, Inc., KPTV, Channel 12.
The 1950s [ edit ]
In 1951, Sawyer's purchased Tru-Vue, the main competitor of View-Master. The take-over eliminated the main rival and also gained Tru-Vue's licensing rights to Walt Disney Studios. Sawyer's capitalized on the opportunity and produced numerous reels featuring Disney characters. The takeover paid off further in 1955 with reels of the newly opened Disneyland.[1]
A View-Master Model E of the 1950s
In 1952, Sawyer's began its View-Master Personal line, which included the View-Master Personal Stereo Camera for its users to make their own View-Master reels. It was successful at first, but the line was discontinued in ten years. This line spawned the Model D viewer, View-Master's highest-quality viewer which was available until the early 1970s, and the Stereomatic 500, View-Master's only 3-D projector.[1] The other projectors were 2-D and used only one of the images.
The Model E was introduced in 1955 with a more modern design, big ivory buttons on the picture changer levers, and a large "V" slot on top for easier reel insertion. It was released in brown and black in the United States, and some other colors elsewhere.[6] It was about 4 inches high, 5 inches wide, and 4 inches deep.
The Model F was introduced in 1958. It used C-cell batteries to power an internal lighting source. Industrial designer Charles "Chuck" Harrison led the team designing the Model F View-Master. Fifty years later in 2008, Harrison won the Cooper-Hewitt Lifetime Achievement Award.[7]
A model G View-Master viewer from the last years of the Sawyer's era
1962–present: stereoscopic toy [ edit ]
In 1962, the Bakelite models were replaced with lighter plastic versions, the first of which was the Model G. This change was driven by Sawyer's new president, Bob Brost, who took over in 1959. The View-Master had been constructed originally from Kodak Tenite plastic and then Bakelite, a hard, sturdy, somewhat heavy plastic. The lightweight thermoplastic became the material of choice under Brost.[1]
In 1966, Sawyer's was acquired by the General Aniline & Film (GAF) Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary. Under GAF's ownership, View-Master reels began to feature fewer scenic and more child-friendly subjects, such as toys and cartoons. Television series were featured on View-Master reels, such as Doctor Who, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, Star Trek, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Family Affair, Here's Lucy, and The Beverly Hillbillies. Actor Henry Fonda appeared in a series of TV commercials for the GAF View-Master.[1]
From 1970 to around 1997, there were versions of "Talking View-Masters", which included audio technology with the reels with three major designs with increasing sophistication.[8] In the early 1970s, GAF introduced the View-Master Rear Screen projector, a table-top projector that displayed images from picture wheels.[9]
In 1980, View-Master released the Show Beam Projector, a toy that combined the company's stereoscopic images and flashlight technology to produce a portable hand-held projector. The Show Beam used small film cartridges that were plugged into the side of the toy. Each cartridge contained 30 full-color 2D images.[10]
In 1981, GAF sold View-Master to a group of investors headed by Arnold Thaler, and the company was reconstituted as the View-Master International Group.[11]
VMI acquired the Ideal Toy Company in 1984 and became known as the View-Master Ideal Group; V-M Ideal in turn was purchased by Tyco Toys in 1989.[12]
Tyco, including the View-Master Ideal Group, merged with Mattel Inc. in 1997. V-M was placed organizationally in Mattel's pre-school division and is now marketed under the Fisher-Price imprint, who continues emphasis on juvenile content.
In 1998, during the purchase of the Tyco Toys-owned plant by Mattel, EPA investigations began on View-Master factory supply well for the toxic chemical trichloroethylene (TCE). The plant was shut down in 2001.[13]
In March 2009, the Fisher-Price division of toy maker Mattel announced that they had stopped production in December 2008 of the scenic reels depicting tourist attractions. These reels of picturesque scenes and landscape scenery were descendants of the first View-Master reels sold in 1939. Fisher-Price announced they would continue to produce reels of animated characters.[14] In late 2009, Alpha-cine announced it would take up the scenic reel production under an agreement with Fisher-Price.[15]
2015-present: Virtual reality [ edit ]
Viewmaster VR set
In February 2015, Mattel announced a collaboration with Google to produce a new version of View-Master called the View-Master Virtual Realty Viewer, based on virtual reality using smartphones. The new View-Master is an implementation of the Google Cardboard VR platform, and is accompanied by a mobile app that was built using its SDK. Content is displayed on a smartphone screen; the phone itself is inserted into the back of the unit. Instead of being inserted directly into the View-Master, reels are scanned using an augmented reality interface which enables access to content from the reel, such as 360-degree panoramas, 3D models, and minigames.[16][17]
Greenbot considered the View-Master to be the best low-cost Cardboard viewer, citing its build quality and comfort over models actually constructed from cardboard, but noting that the latch mechanism for securing the phone inside wasn't tight enough, and that there was no headphone jack access. In conclusion, it was felt that the View-Master VR was "the kind of thing you might grab as a gift for the kids, but if you're curious about VR on your phone, chances are you'll use it as much as they do."[18]
In 2016, an updated iteration known as the DLX was released; it features improvements to its compatibility with smaller phones, a more secure latch for the phone compartment, and also adds focal adjustment and a headphone port.[19]
Cumulative production and honor [ edit ]
There have been some 25 viewer models, thousands of titles, and 1.5 billion copies of reels. The basic design remained intact for reels and internal mechanisms, despite its long history and many changes in models and materials, ensuring that every reel will work in every model.[1]
View-Master is part of the National Toy Hall of Fame of the United States.[20]
Notable uses [ edit ]
Specifications for View-Master reels
Reels have been produced for Disneyland, many TV shows (such as The Flying Nun, Lost In Space, and The Munsters, blockbuster movies (such as The Poseidon Adventure, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and Jurassic Park), and the U.S. military (for airplane and ship identification and range estimation).
David L. Bassett, an expert on anatomy and dissection, collaborated with Gruber to create a 25-volume atlas of human anatomy using the View-Master system.[21]
View-Master produced custom reels for commercial customers to show 3-D images of products and services to potential clients. For example, in the early 1990s, Canadian restaurant chain East Side Mario's used a View-Master reel as their dessert menu.[22]
Among the newest View-Master products are a Discovery Channel View-Master, the new Virtual Viewer, the Discovery Channel View-Master Projector and Telescope, and the View-Master 3-D Pocket Viewer, which feature images of popular performers in concert and backstage.

Whenever the 49ers played musical chairs along the offensive line over the past few seasons, it hasn't been for the best of reasons.
Sliding Marcus Martin inside to center or shuffling Erik Pears between tackle and guard aren't strategic improvements so much as they are last-ditch survival efforts — efforts that failed miserably in 2015.
After the unexpected return of Anthony Davis this offseason there seemed to be two polarizing schools of though:
1. This guy's been out for a year and smack-talked the organization. He's done.
2. We have our starting right tackle back!
Nobody could've foreseen Davis' voluntary move to right guard, and one that improved the overall quality of the 49ers' line rather than patching up a deficiency, no less. For that, thank 23-year-old Trent Brown, whose emergence as a starting-caliber tackle is perhaps the most important improvement to the 49ers roster that has arisen during training camp.
“I think some of what's going on with Trent is I think Trent is realizing their abilities and understanding how successful they can be at this game,” said 49ers coach Chip Kelly.
“From a coach standpoint, it's awesome to see. It's watching them kind of mature and grow and get better and better. It's pretty cool to see from that standpoint, but a lot of it, the credit goes to Trent because of what he's invested in himself.”
Davis' move inside to accommodate Brown's rising talent will displace Andrew Tiller, Zane Beadles or Joshua Garnett along the starter five. By transitive property, that implies San Francisco's coaching staff finds Brown more valuable as a starter at tackle than any of the three guards, since they simply could've left Davis at tackle and let those guards compete to start while Brown provided depth as a ‘swing' tackle.
That's an impressive jump for a 2015 seventh rounder that wasn't even a lock to make the roster over Pears a month ago.
Brown started the final two games for the 49ers in 2015 and looked promising while doing it. What he's accomplished over the offseason though, is a cut above what their play projected.
Their attention to conditioning and managing their weight during the summer gave them the tenacity to shoulder the workload of Chip Kelly's up-tempo offense. Add that to the largest frame on the 49ers roster (6-foot-8, 355 pounds), and you can wave goodbye to the team's most glaring hole from last year in the right tackle position.
“He's been doing a tremendous job,” said quarterback Blaine Gabbert. “The way he's approached the summer program, coming into training camp, the first two preseason games have been tremendous. He's been playing their tail off and he's such a young player, he's only going to continue to get better. He's been doing a heck-of-a job.”
What was once a scramble to hide poor play or bandage injuries along the offensive line is now luxuriously considered versatility in San Francisco. It all starts with Brown's ascension, and the 49ers offensive line could jump from the bottom of the NFL to one that catalyzes a surprising offense in Kelly's first season.
MOSCOW (AFP) - Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov on Saturday (Dec 16) warned of a risk of escalation after Washington toughened its stance on North Korea nuclear talks and United States President Donald Trump accused Moscow of failing to help.
"It's sad that this powerful element of demands for further pressure on Pyongyang has once again appeared in the American position," Ryabkov told RIA Novosti news agency.
"It's high time to stop this race of threats, pressure, blackmail and presentation of preconditions and shift to a real search for a political solution," Ryabkov said.
They said that now both Pyongyang and Washington are now putting forward preconditions for talks and there is a "risk of uncontrolled escalation".
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday (Dec 15)at the United Nations Security Council backed away from an earlier offer of unconditional talks to end the stand-off with Pyongyang, apparently under White House pressure.
Trump on Friday complained that "Russia is not helping" to pressure North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons programme.
Ryabkov said that "after the UN Security Council session and speeches by senior representatives of Western countries, we got the impression that the logic of pressure is the dominant one in their approach".
They warned that the current situation is "extremely dangerous".
"We wouldn't like to end up in a situation where despite all the efforts by Russia and North Korea and by our two countries jointly, yet another spiral of confrontation begins."
Moscow had close ties with its far eastern neighbour during the Soviet era when the countries shared Communist ideology and they still have relatively warm relations.
Both Pyongyang's chief ally China and Russia argue that sanctions alone will not compel North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to change course and want to step up diplomatic efforts to achieve a solution.
Ryabkov called for "openness and dialogue from both Pyongyang and Washington, mutual restraint and an aim to work out a starting point for a diplomatic step forward".
State minimum wages will exceed the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour in 21 states on Jan. 1.
Alex Robles joins dozens of sign-holding protesters at a rally against low wages for fast-food workers in front of a McDonald's on Dec. 5 in Phoenix. (Photo11: Ross D. Franklin, AP) Story Highlights Most states could exceed federal minimum wage by end of 2014, analyst predicts
Low-wage jobs have dominated payroll growth
Opponents say raising minimum wages will mean fewer jobs
The retail-worker strikes that swept the nation in 2013 did not move Congress to raise the minimum wage, but a growing number of states are taking action.
The minimum wage will rise in 13 states this week, and as many as 11 states and Washington, D.C., are expected to consider increases in 2014, according to the National Employment Law Project. Approval is likely in more than half of the 11, says NELP policy analyst Jack Temple.
STORY: Tipped workers often face lower minimums
The trend reflects growing concerns about the disproportionate spread of low-wage jobs in the U.S. economy, creating millions of financially strained workers and putting too little money in consumers' pockets to spur faster economic growth.
On Jan. 1, state minimum wages will be higher than the federal requirement of $7.25 an hour in 21 states, up from 18 two years ago. Temple expects another nine states to drift above the federal minimum by the end of 2014, marking the first time minimum pay in most states will be above the federal level.
"2014 is poised to be a turning point," Temple says. "States are seeing the unemployment rate is going down but job growth is disproportionately concentrated in low-wage industries. (They're) frustrated that Congress is dragging its feet."
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island legislatures voted to raise the minimum hourly wage by as much as $1, to $8 to $8.70, by Wednesday. In California, a $1 increase to $9 is scheduled July 1. Smaller automatic increases tied to inflation will take effect in nine other states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.
Meanwhile, states such as Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maryland, Minnesota and South Dakota plan to weigh minimum-wage hikes next year through legislation or ballot initiatives.
STORY: Democrats say minimum-wage battles to help 2014 turnout
In Minnesota, the state House and Senate have each passed bills to raise the minimum wage and plan to iron out their differences early next year after failing to approve similar measures the past two decades.
"You're coming out of a deep recession, and people are landing jobs, but they're low-paid," says state Rep. Ryan Winkler, sponsor of the House bill.
The legislative movement has been partly fueled by walkouts this year in at least 100 cities by fast-food workers who are calling for $15-an-hour pay and the right to form unions. Wal-Mart workers have staged similar protests.
While the demonstrations were not explicitly intended to prompt minimum pay increases, they've made the issue "more urgent," Temple says.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 3.6 million hourly paid workers received wages at or below the federal minimum in 2012 — almost 5% of all employees on hourly pay schedules.
President Obama recently said they support legislation in Congress that would lift the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour in three steps over two years and then index it to inflation. But the measure faces an uphill climb in Congress.
Proponents of minimum-wage hikes note that low-wage jobs have dominated payroll growth in the 4-year-old recovery, and increases over the past four decades have not kept pace with inflation.
Opponents say the increases raise employer expenses and will lead to layoffs. "If your costs are going up and you can't raise prices, you have to find a way to produce the same product at a lower cost," says Michael Saltsman, a research fellow at the Employment Policies Institute.
Where minimum wage is going up
On Jan. 1, the minimum wage in 13 states will increase to these amounts.
State New minimum wage Arizona $7.90 Colorado $8.00 Connecticut $8.70 Florida $7.93 Missouri $7.50 Montana $7.90 New Jersey $8.25 New York $8.00 Ohio $7.95 Oregon $9.10 Rhode Island $8.00 Vermont $8.73 Washington $9.32

Episode Mentions
The following is a list of episodes where Barney's Blog is specifically mentioned by one of the characters.
While riding in a cab, Barney's so excited Ted finally suited up at their request that he's going to put it in their blog.
"Look at you, you beautiful bastard, you suited up. This is totally going in my blog."
Barney tells Lily one of the twenty-four similarities between women and fish, realizing that since they didn't know that, they didn't read their blog.
"One of the twenty-four similarities between women and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?"
Barney angrily shouts to Ted when they ditch them to get a tattoo with Amy.
"This is so going in my blog!"
Ted explains to the group why Barney goes to pet stores to pick up women.
"God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog."
Ted admits it and explains they are often bored at work. Later in their apartment, Barney is seen typing into their blog, reflecting on all the women they saw earlier than part of of their search for the mystery girl. However the entry was never really posted.
Barney's co-worker Randy, who Barney asks to be their wingman when they and Ted aren't talking, says that they regularly read the blog.
"I have been reading your blog for years. You are like a god to me. "
Robin's co-worker Don is naked when Robin enters their house.
"...It's called 'The Naked Man' I read it on some guy's blog."
In the cab, Barney mentions a rule from their blog to Marshall.
"The rule is no kids until you're at least 45. Do you ever read my blog?! It's gotten a lot better."
Barney gets in a fight with Robin about being unable to post a boner joke on the blog, leading into their divorce.
"It's not a business, Barney, it's a blog, okay?"
Notes and Trivia
Barney's Blog is maintained and written each week by Matt Kuhn, one of the writers for the show.
The song that plays when Barney is seen typing on their blog in The Bracket ​ is the theme song for the show "Doogie Howser, M.D.". This memento from the beginning of Neil Patrick Harris' career makes the entire scene resemble the scene at the end of every episode of "Doogie Howser M.D." where Doogie would write an entry in their digital diary.
Venture capital firms invested $1.8 billion in commercial space startups in 2015, nearly doubling the amount of venture cash invested in the industry in all of the previous 15 years combined. A new report released by Virginia-based aerospace and defense consultancy The Tauri Group suggests that space startups turned a major corner in 2015, at least in the eyes of venture capital firms that are now piling money into young space companies with unprecedented gusto.
A handful of significant investments in space startups—defined in the report as angel- and venture-backed companies that have received seed, VC, or private equity investment—drove the industry's banner year. Those included a $1 billion investment in Elon Musk's SpaceX from Google (goog) and Fidelity, a $500 million funding round by satellite communications company OneWeb, and significant investments by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in space launch startup Blue Origin. But the study also found that more than 50 venture capital firms invested in space companies in 2015, signaling that venture capital has warmed to a space industry it has long considered both too risky and too slow to yield returns.
Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.
“It's really an unprecedented level of investment activity by non-space actors in space,” says Carissa Christensen, managing partner of The Tauri Group and adviser to several commercial space startups. “The core message is that its been a very large investment year for space, and particularly for these kinds of companies.”
From 2000 through 2015, space startups reeled in $13.3 billion in investment cash, including $2.9 billion in venture capital. A full $1.8 billion—or roughly two-thirds—of that venture capital was invested last year alone. The influx of all that VC cash suggests a shifting perception among investors, Christensen says.
Investment in space-related startups was once largely dominated by “advocacy investors” passionate about space travel (think Elon Musk) and corporations with strategic interests in Earth orbit (telecoms, satellite TV providers, etc.). Now, thanks to a handful of very visible successes from companies like SpaceX, a broader base of investors is looking at space startups as more traditional tech investments—the kind that rapidly bring a product to market and generate revenue in the relatively near term. Those products and revenues generally have less to do with space and more to do with information, Christensen says.
“SpaceX opened the door, but what really brought on the investment is data,” they say. A slew of space industry startups—companies like Spire, Planet Labs, Mapbox, BlackSky Global, and Orbital Insight—have attracted venture funds by positioning themselves along a space-based data supply chain, either by building and managing constellations (or future constellations) of small Earth-imaging satellites or by managing and crunching the data those satellites collect. Deployed in large enough numbers, these constellations can provide a regularly refreshing bird's-eye views of the entire planet—data sets from which companies can monitor global economic activity.
For more on the commercial space industry, watch:
“The play is not because it's space,” Christensen says. “The play is not even because it's imagery. The play is because these satellite systems are going to create large data sets, and those data sets yield insight into corporate policy and industrial activity around the globe—things like corporate supply chains, oil production, or shipping and maritime activity.”
Investors see a lot of untapped value in those data sets, and coupled with the falling cost of small satellite components that value is changing investor attitudes toward young space startups. The question going forward, Christensen says, is which companies can move beyond their current pre-revenue stage and begin providing the kinds of returns on investment venture capital firms expect.
“Some people have made money through high valuations, but no one has yet made money just by making money—by selling product,” they say. “That's why it's a really exciting time to see how these companies perform. Now the interesting question is going to be: How does this play out in terms of who delivers and when?”

Over 600 Students, Alumni, And Faculty Sign Declaration Condemning Apartheid Divest
In response to Columbia University Apartheid Divest's embracing of the Barnard Columbia Socialists' treatment of the early 1990's and 2000-2005 intifadas as actions of “civil disobedience,” over 600 students, alumni, and faculty have come together to condemn the characterization. The group is not representative of Aryeh, J Street Initiative, or any pro-Israel group on campus, but includes both Jews and non-Jews from different places on the political spectrum.
The text of the statement reads as follows: “We the undersigned students, alumni and faculty write today to condemn Columbia University Apartheid Divest's dismissal of terrorism as ‘civil disobedience.' The first and second intifadas mark tragic low points in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thousands of innocent civilians on both sides were murdered during these violent periods. The mischaracterization of suicide bombings, stabbings, and shootings as ‘civil disobedience' is an egregious ethical breach. We proudly uphold the value of free speech, but malicious incitement and fictitious characterizations do not lie within that value and should find no welcome within our campus discourse.”
Update (9:16PM): The post has been revised to include information regarding Barnard Columbia Socialists' stance on the intifadas.
As the presidential candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties begin the last sprint toward the general election, U.S. citizens are becoming more and more frustrated by the political campaign.
WikiLeaks recently promised “significant” disclosures on the U.S. election, war, arms and oil in the coming weeks. It is widely believed that these revelations will add more flames to the already chaotic political show.
Scandals have dogged the two main candidates throughout the 2016 election, which has further increased dissatisfaction among U.S. citizens. According to a recent Gallup poll, 60 percent of registered voters view Donald Trump as the least favorable candidates in 25 years, and Hillary Clinton as the second least favorable.
The tax-related questions for Trump, as well as worries over Clinton's health and their use of a private email server, have all led to the current state of the election. In their first presidential debate, the two candidates focused more on personal attacks than policies. The Times commented in an editorial that the candidates have neglected the widening gap between the American dream and social reality.
A recent survey showed that voters now perceive the government and congress as the biggest problems needing to be addressed in American society. These concerns come ahead of issues like the economy, employment and immigration. Of course, that doesn't mean voters don't care about economic and social issues, but it does show the great and growing concerns that U.S. citizens have about their political system.
Despite protests against money-oriented politics and election scandals, Trump still plans to drop another $140 million on campaign ads. Anticipated to cost as much as $5 billion, most of which comes from special interest groups, the 2016 election is likely to be the most expensive one in history.
People are very clear about the sour fruits of money-oriented politics, and the new U.S. president is unlikely to end political confrontation or even do much to ease discontent toward the government. As British economist Martin Wolf said, growing inequality and slowing productivity have made democracy intolerant and capitalism illegitimate.
For a long time, the U.S. has boasted that its lively election is a sign of its system's superiority. However, the essential purpose of the election is to provide a driving force for development. The most important task for presidential nominees is not to win the election, but to eventually govern the country.
It's time for the U.S. to take a close, honest look at its arrogant democracy and flawed politics.

“But that's not real socialism,” says every leftist sympathizer when confronted with the horrific reality of Venezuela's collapse into an autocratic dystopia. But for those of us who don't have our heads in the sand, Venezuela is a textbook example of what happens when socialism infects a country and purges any hint of private enterprise.
The people of Venezuela are suffering tremendously thanks to the Bolivarian socialist experiment. Hugo Chavez, the socialist state's now-deceased founding father, once promised a flourishing utopia where children were merry and the poor were well-fed. Today, Venezuela is anything but joyous. It's hell on earth.
Under Chavez's handpicked successor, President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuelans are flooding the streets in protest against everything the socialist state stands for: poverty, destitution, starvation, suffering, and ideological slavery. Intent on preserving the socialist system by any means necessary, Maduro has consolidated power like a king and deployed the state's security forces to beat down protesters. Before socialism suffocated the prosperity and freedom out of the country, Venezuela was a relatively successful state relative to its neighbors in Latin America. In 2017, Venezuela is a trash heap pitied by the entire region.
Here are five tangible ways socialism itself turned Venezuela into a trash heap:
1. State-imposed price controls limited the supply of basic goods by rendering production unprofitable. In order for Bolivarian revolution to fully materialize, the socialist state needed to have full control over the price of goods coming out of factories. As long as the oligarchs in government enjoyed the fruits of oil revenue, profit for businesses, both large and small, were considered antithetical to the socialist agenda. The proletariat had to have access to goods even if it meant producing those goods at a loss, demanded the socialist state. After incurring tremendous losses, many businesses shut down, unable to continue production. With nobody left to make basic goods, supply became scarce, naturally pushing up the price of goods. And at a certain point, only the richest of the rich could afford goods smuggled across the border and sold on the black market.
2. Venezuela became a single commodity market. By discouraging businesses to pursue profit, the socialist government pushed the economy back to the dark ages. Creativity died. Nobody was incentivized to produce anything of value or innovate. Luckily, Venezuela had a safety net: oil, lots of it. But the global oil market is fickle. It ebbs and flows. Prices drop and rise quickly. When your entire economy is reliant on one commodity, then your economic fate is intertwined with price fluctuations that are beyond your control.
3. Venezuela subsidized its unsustainable welfare state with oil revenue. State-run oil companies were responsible for producing the revenue necessary to subsidize the government's extensive welfare programs. Under the socialist system, the poor were promised housing, education, healthcare and other wildly expensive benefits. To pay for all of this, the Venezuelan state sold oil in bulk overseas. But when the price of crude plunged, Venezuela went into uncontrollable free fall. By then the people had become so reliant on public services and government benefits that they had no way to take care of themselves on their own. The government controlled the lives of the people and now the government had no way to keep them healthy, fed, and alive.
4. The socialist system encouraged corruption. A socialist government needs an absurd number of government workers to run the day-to-day lives of the people. As a result, government itself becomes the one employer that is always hiring more employees. In socialist Venezuela, the government filled its coffers with oil revenue, generously paying top officials who exercised control over oil profit distribution. Government oligarchs grew rich while the people remained poor. The Washington Examiner explains further:
The bigger the government, the more people's success depends on sucking up to officials rather than on offering a service to consumers. Expanding state bureaucracies offer new opportunities for nepotism. First, Venezuelan jobs were allocated on the basis of political allegiance; now food supplies are.
5. The government had no way of controlling hyperinflation because the country's monetary policy was imaginary. The Venezuelan state pretended to have control over the price of the bolivar, the nation's (now-worthless) currency. The socialist state thought that it could set the price of goods, wages, property, and services and simply print money to make up for deficits. But as it turns out, recklessly printing money doesn't actually work.
Forbes contributor Tim Worstall explains why the socialist government's monetary policy was destined to fail:
The government does indeed control certain nominal numbers about the economy. They can and do insist that the bolivar is worth this much, that bread must be sold at a certain price, that wages are this or that. And then that reality does that uncomfortable thing again and it turns out that the bolivar is worth what someone will pay for it, no more, meaning that the nominal prices of labour or bread are very different from the real ones. Give me your backing as we create a constituent assembly and I will give you victory over rising prices. Give me the constituent assembly and you will see. We will go to battle over inflation and those criminals who profiteer and perpetuate our problems. The inflation is of course being created by the government as they print money to pay their bills. For the Modern Monetary Theory people are entirely correct, government can just print money and spend it on whatever it likes. When they've done so hyperinflation like that in Venezuela is usually what results as well. Meaning that there's nothing wrong with MMT as a theory it's just that it always fails as a policy.
Worstall concludes that when the government aggressively allocates resources, in any country, including the United States, it's always bad news.
“Economics is about the allocation of real resources so it's the real prices that matter,” they note. “The Chavistas thought it was nominal that mattered, that they could just set prices as they wish. It doesn't work that way, something we should recall as our own democratic socialists attempt to fix the prices of rent, wages, college and the rest.”
PHOENIX — By March 1, people in Southern California will be sipping on a San Tan Brewing Company beer and, by April 1, Texas will follow suit.
Anthony Canecchia, head brewer and owner at San Tan, said Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada could be added to the list of states where San Tan is available by summertime.
“We're trying to cover the geographic footprint of the Southwest,” they said. “Our goal is to become the Southwest's premier regional craft brewery.”
Canecchia just finished a whirlwind, week-long trip to California and Texas which included a stop in Austin, considered the craft beer capitol of Texas.
San Tan will have the capability to brew 48,000 barrels of beer by the end of 2014 at their new Chandler plant. Currently, Phoenix Ale Brewery and Grand Canyon Brewing are the only Arizona craft brews being shipped out of state.

Billionaire business person Marc Cuban insists that the H-1B visa racket is a feature of the vaunted American free market. This is nonsense on stilts. It can't go unchallenged.
Another billionaire, our president, has ordered that the H-1B program be reformed. This, too, is disappointing. You'll see why.
First, let's correct Mr. Cuban: America has not a free economy, but a mixed-economy. State and markets are intertwined. Trade, including trade in labor, is not free; it's regulated to the hilt. If anything, the labyrinth of work visas is an example of a fascistic government-business cartel in operation.
The H-1B permit, in particular, is part of that state-sponsored visa system. The primary H-1B hogs—Infosys (and another eight, sister Indian firms), Microsoft, and Intel—import labor with what are grants of government privilege. Duly, the corporations that hog H-1Bs act like incorrigibly corrupt rent seekers. Not only do they get to replace the American worker, but they get to do so at their expense.
Here's how:
Globally, a series of sordid liaisons ensures that American workers are left high and dry. Through the programs of the International Trade Administration, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the International Monetary Fund, and other oink-operations, the taxpaying American worker is forced to subsidize and underwrite the investment risks of the very corporations that have given them the boot.
Domestically, the fascistic partnership with the State amounts to a subsidy to business at the expense of the taxpayer. See, corporations in our democratic welfare state externalize their employment costs onto the taxpayers.
So while public property is property funded by taxpayers through expropriated taxes; belongs to taxpayers; is to be managed for their benefit—at least one million additional immigrants a year, including recipients of the H-1B visa, are allowed the free use of taxpayer-supported infrastructure and amenities. Every new arrival avails themselves of public works such as roads, hospitals, parks, libraries, schools, and welfare.
Does this epitomize the classical liberal idea of laissez faire?
Moreover, chain migration or family unification means every H-1B visa recruit is a ticket for an entire tribe. The initial entrant—the meal ticket—will pay their way. The honor system not being an especially strong value in the Third World, the rest of the clan will be America's problem. More often than not, chain-migration entrants become wards of the American taxpayer.
Spreading like gravy over a tablecloth, this rapid, inorganic population growth is detrimental to all ecosystems: natural, social and political.
Take Seattle and its surrounding counties. Between April 2015 and 2016, the area was inundated with “86,320 new residents, marking it the region's biggest population gains this century. Fueled in large part by the technology industry, an average of 236 people is moving to the Seattle area each day,” reported Geekwire.com. (Reporters for our local fish-wrapper—in my case, parrot-cage liner—have discharged their journalistic duties by inviting readers to "share" their traffic-jam stories.)
Never as dumb as the local reporters, the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Cuban are certainly as detached.
Barricaded in their obscenely lavish compounds—from the comfort of their monster mansions—these social engineers don't experience the "environmental impacts of rapid urban expansion”; the destruction of verdant open spaces and farmland; the decrease in the quality of the water we drink and air we breathe, the increase in traffic and traffic accidents, air pollution, the cellblock-like housing erected to accommodate their imported I.T. workers and extended families, the delicate bouquet of amped up waste management and associated seepages.
For locals, this lamentable state means an inability to afford homes in a market in which property prices have been artificially inflated. Young couples lineup to view tiny apartments. They dream of that picket fence no more. (And our "stupid leaders," to quote the president before they joined leadership, wonder why birthrates are so low!)
In a true free market, absent the protectionist state, corporate employers would be accountable to the community, and would be wary of the strife and lowered productivity brought about by a multiethnic and multi-linguistic workforce. All the more so when a foreign workforce moves into residential areas almost overnight as has happened in Seattle and its surrounds.
Alas, since the high-tech traitors can externalize their employment costs on to the community; because corporations are subsidized at every turn by their victims—they need not bring in the best.
Cuban thinks they do. High tech needs to be able to "search the world for the best applicants," they burbled to Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
Yet more cr-p.
Why doesn't the president know that the H-1B visa category is not a special visa for highly skilled individuals, but goes mostly to average workers? "Indian business-process outsourcing companies, which predominantly provide technology support to corporate back offices," by the Economist's accounting.
Overall, the work done by the H1-B intake does not require independent judgment, critical reasoning or higher-order thinking. "Average workers; ordinary talent doing ordinary work," attest the experts who've been studying this intake for years. The master's degree is the exception within the H1-B visa category.
More significant: THERE IS a visa category that is reserved exclusively for individuals with extraordinary abilities and achievement. I know, because the principal sponsor in our family received this visa. I first wrote about the visa that doesn't displace ordinary Americans in ... 2008:
It's the O-1 visa.
"Extraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics," states the Department of Homeland Security, "means a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of endeavor."
Most significant: There is no cap on the number of O-1 visa entrants allowed. Access to this limited pool of talent is unlimited.
My point vis-à-vis the O-1 visa is this: The H-1B hogs are forever claiming that they are desperate for talent. In reality, they have unlimited access to individuals with unique abilities through the open-ended O-1 visa program.
There is no limit to the number of geniuses American companies can import.
Theoretically, the H-1B program could be completely abolished and all needed Einsteins imported through the O-1 program. (Why, even future first ladies would stand a chance under the business category of the O-1A visa, as a wealth-generating supermodel could certainly qualify.)
Now you understand my disappointment. In their April 18 Executive Order, President Trump promised to merely reform a program that needs abolishing. That is, if "Hire American" means anything to anybody anymore.
“It is not male society but mother nature who lays the heaviest burden on women.” Camille Paglia
A number of market indicators are suggesting that women are more suited to post industrial capitalist society than men are. Women are more successful in education, physical health, mental health, family, political influence, and employment.
There was a debate, (November 15th), titled: The End of Men, be it resolved men are obsolete. It's the latest in the Monk Debate series. In this ‘Attention Age' it is the Shock that gets noticed. There is so much noise in cyberspace – that tired cacophony, thus in order to be heard one has to spark outrage, be angry, shock, humiliate, titillate or otherwise appeal to the reptilian brain to get attention. A positive predictor of going viral is anger. Hence, a Man Are Obsolete debate – by four women.
In the preamble to the debate on whether men were obsolete, Caitlin Moran suggested that in terms of equality women were still far behind men. The example they gave, perhaps poorly chosen, was the Oscars. They said jokingly that equality will be evident when women go up on stage to accept their Oscars in comfortable shoes. They made the analogy that George Clooney is at the event discussing their next project and women are huddled in a corner talking about how much their feet hurt in their high-heeled shoes, or how a photo makes them look unattractive. Is that not a vanity problem rather than an equality problem? Trivial comparisons for sure. But in a more serious tone it was suggested that when the CEO's of fortune 500 companies are evenly split between men and women, only then will there be true equality in society. An equality where, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the CEO's in the mid 60's took home 24 times more pay than the average worker. In 2009 they took home 185 times more money than the average worker. The irony is that of 29 directors of the institute, 9 are women.
One commenter pointed out another bit of irony as follows, “The Monk debate is organized by: Tim Berners-Lee, and Patrick Luciani. The comments posted on the platform Disqus was made by, Daniel Ha and Jason Yan. This page uses HTML: proposed by Tim Berners-Lee. The information might be stored in MySQL (Michael Widenius) or Oracle (Larry Ellison, Bob Miner and Ed Oates), or perhaps postgreSQL (Michael Stonebraker). Does it use PHP? (Rasmus Lerdorf ) Or Java? (James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton). These women use Twitter (Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone and Noah Glass), and Facebook ( Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes). They might be using an Android phone (based on linux by Linus Torval and Gnu founder Richard Stallman), or an Iphone (Steve Jobs designed by Jonathan Ive). Or they might be using Macs or Windows (Jobs and Gates). I could go on and on like this. But these two women (Rosin and Dowd) should realize that this debate would not even exist without men, they would not even be able to talk about it. In picture, they do look like intelligent women, they must realize that without men all of this does not exist right? This is only a joke, right?”
So the debate did provoke anger, and some much-needed clarity, but the points above show that men, contrary to the conclusion of the debate, are not obsolete. Other writers have pointed out comments made by the recently deceased, Doris Lessing, the Nobel winning author, who said in 2001, that modern men were ‘cowed' by women. They can't fight back,” they said. “And it's time they did.”
Intimidation is a word that has been increasing in use over the last 150 years, and is pretty much at an all-time high now in the English-speaking world. We live in an intimidating post industrial society. Politicians, who are mostly men, are indeed intimidated and threatened by the organization and power of women's groups. It is easy votes to get on a platform and commit money towards women's issues, and sure-fire damnation if any politician were to cut funding to anything related to women. How intimidating is that? Men are seemingly expendable political whipping posts.
The University of Toronto, has 40 courses dedicated to women's studies and one dedicated to transgender males, and one about homosexual males – how intimidating is that? How intimidating would it be for a politician to come out and say that being a mom is by no means the toughest job in the world?
Men are indeed cowed by political pressure, politicians are subservient to the organized power groups. In the European Union former political leaders are calling for the State to set up a monitoring system to watch for intolerant citizens. “The Framework said it hopes to take concrete action to combat intolerance, in particular with a view to eliminating, among other thoughts […] anti-feminism […].”
There is a growing movement of angry young men that are reacting against what they perceive as the smug self-righteousness of feminist ideology. It is evident, as can be seen in other countries, like the UK and a growing number of EU nations for instance, that these angry men and boys will be picked up by the fringe political parties. There should be a debate around men as scapegoats. In a seeming, blink-of-the-eye – things could change, but don't confuse change, with – good.
We need to pay attention to what is going on and not let politicians be cowed by ideologies that damage men and boys. The major political parties need to identify the problems with men and boys – and not be intimidated against taking action to actually help.
No one cares, until something shocking happens.
Boys born through a common type of IVF treatment are suffering from low sperm counts and may not be able to have children naturally, a study suggests.
Doctors in Brussels pioneered intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the 1990s and have been following 54 children born using the procedure ever since.
The technique, developed to help male infertility, involves selecting a healthy sperm and injecting it into an egg before the resulting embryo is implanted into the mother. It is now commonly used in fertility procedures even when the woman is infertile, because selecting the best sperm increases the chance of a healthy baby.
However, experts were concerned at the time that baby boys born from this technique would also inherit their father's infertility, meaning future generations would always require ICSI to become parents.
In the first study of its kind, the team who carried out the original procedure discovered that the 54 men, who are now aged between 18 and 22, had almost half the sperm concentration of naturally conceived men as well as a 62 per cent lower sperm count, and 66 per cent lower sperm motility – which measures how well a sperm can move.
The men were also nearly four times more likely to have sperm counts below the level deemed normal by the World Health Organization.
Prof Andre Van Steirteghem who headed the Centre for Reproductive Medicine at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium, where the technique was developed, said: “These findings are not unexpected.
“Before ICSI was carried out, prospective parents were informed that it may well be that their sons may have impaired sperm and semen like their fathers. For all the parents this information was not a reason to abstain from ICSI because, as they said: ‘if this happens ICSI can then also be a solution for our sons'.
“These first results from the oldest group of ICSI-conceived adults worldwide indicate that a degree of ‘sub-fertility' has, indeed, been passed on to sons of fathers who underwent ICSI because of impaired semen characteristics.”
The first ICSI baby was born on 14 January 1992 and all the men in the study were born in the early years of the technique, between 1992 and 1994.
The researchers adjusted their results for factors that could affect semen quality, such as age, body mass index and sexual malformations.
Around half of the 60,000 annual fertility treatments in Britain involve ICSI and it is often used when the cause of infertility is unknown.
However, the authors warn that the findings from this study cannot be extrapolated to all offspring born after ICSI since it can be used when there is no evidence that a couple's infertility is due to abnormal sperm.
Allan Pacey, professor of Andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: “When the ICSI procedure was first introduced into clinical practice there was much discussion and debate about what the future fertility prospects would be of any males that were conceived this way, when they reached adulthood.
This was because the reason for using the ICSI procedure to conceive them in the first place was because of the father's poor sperm quality, which was almost certainly of genetic origin
“This was because the reason for using the ICSI procedure to conceive them in the first place was because of the father's poor sperm quality, which was almost certainly of genetic origin.
“Therefore, if those genes were inherited by any son's born through the ICSI procedure, it seemed likely that they would have the same level of infertility and potentially require the use of ICSI themselves when they wanted to become a father.”
Prof Simon Fishel, managing director of CARE Fertility, added: “We may still find that these men are able to conceive naturally. Just having low semen parameters is not evidence for the requirement of ICSI or IVF technologies. We know many men with such are indeed able to conceive naturally.
“More follow-up studies will be required to ascertain meaningful outcomes.” The research was published in the journal Human Reproduction.

After the success of Alkaline Trio's US tour with Bayside, they elected to bring them over to the UK. Which was heavily anticipated by the public judging by the near equal measure of Bayside and Alkaline Trio shirts worn to the show. Bringing along with them Scotland's Murder Burgers to get the crowd into the punk spirit.
If we learnt anything from the Murder Burgers half hour set it is that fast, raw pop-punk is alive and well in Scotland. Taking no prisoners as they blasted through their set at an impressive speed, although it made it difficult to tell some songs apart, they still got the crowd nice and ready for the rest of the night.
However it is unusual to see a venue fill up just as much as it did for Bayside to take to the stage, billed as second support it had a closer feeling to a co-headline tour. With the venue starting to feel quite tight by the time the lights went dark, the theme from the film Inception being played over the PA whipped the place into a frenzy. Opening with the with track from their new album, Bayside immediately got the night in full swing. Between the energy they brought with them and the note for note execution of their songs, they were definitely a high point of the night.
Then it was time for the masters of the morbid, Alkaline Trio. Playing a healthy mix of songs from just about every album except 2008s ‘Agony & Irony' and only the one track from their 2010 album ‘This Addiction', focusing heavily on their older material was definitely well received by the crowd. ‘Opening with This Could Be Love' which never fails to get a crowd singing, and closing with their fan favourite hit ‘Radio'. Although they played well, and we're clearly enjoying themselves, the sound levels were off by a fair way which caused some bad feedback and the bass on Dan's vocals being too high making it difficult to even tell which song they were singing.
Rating: 6.5 slices out of 8
The Toronto Raptors are the hottest team in the NBA, which doesn't necessarily make them the best team, but given the franchise's recent success doesn't mean that winning 10 of their past 11 starts and sitting a half game out of first place in the Eastern Conference is an aberration, either.
The Raptors have been among the best teams in the NBA for three calendar years now, and appear to be improving. When you sport a league-leading offensive rating of 115.3 points per 100 possessions — nearly two points ahead of the second-place Golden State Warriors and three more than the Warriors managed in their 73-win season a year ago – clearly something is happening.
And they know it.
“It's not a fluke,” said DeMar DeRozan, amid a career year in their eighth season, averaging 28 points a game, fourth in the NBA. “We've had one of the toughest schedules the league and we've figured out a way to come out on top and it's not just from one individual, it's coming from a team perspective, you know?”
People should now.
But the curious thing as the Raptors continue to roll — they are going for their fifth straight win and 11th in 12 games against the visiting Atlanta Hawks at the Air Canada Centre Friday night — is how little apparent buzz their performance is generating outside of the ACC, which will be sold out for the 106th straight game, and among local television audiences, which are up significantly.
In a long NBA season there are lulls and this part of December – after all the early season excitement has petered out and before the Christmas Day hoops festival ramps up – qualifies as one of them. It's a good time for lists.
Thus we have the quarter-season award watch. One might think that the Raptors, given their status as the league's most excellent offence and their December dominance and status near the top of the league tables would get their share of buzz.
One might think wrong.
We've long given up thinking that the Raptors will ever be top-of-mind league-wide. Their status as the NBA's lone Canadian franchise means they will always fall short in terms of getting their fair share of national US broadcasts or appearances on the Christmas Day showcases and the like. It's not going to happen. Two US markets drive ratings and broadcast revenues more efficiently than one Canadian market and one US market. It's just math.
But what is interesting is how the Raptors' early season accomplishments have barely penetrated the consciousness of even those who aren't presumably thinking about ratings or advertising revenues and who are appealing to a hardcore basketball audience.
A sampling of three respected NBA voices' early season awards tracking leaves the Raptors virtually bereft of any kind of recognition whatsoever.
At SI.com, Ben Golliver – who drew the Raptors ire when they and colleague Rob Mahoney had DeRozan ranked 46th on their pre-season list of the NBA's top 100 players — listed five candidates for Most Valuable Player and two honourable mentions without getting to DeRozan or Kyle Lowry who have been the twin locomotives driving the Raptors train.

Similarly, Sam Amick and Jeff Zillgitt of USA Today didn't acknowledge the potential candidacy of either of the Raptors duo.
Howard Beck, who covers the NBA for Bleacher Report, listed nine players who deserved MVP consideration through the season's first 20 or so games without mentioning a Raptor.
Granted, the MVP award is the NBA's tallest mountain, scaled only by Hall-of-Famers, and this season to date has produced some incredible performances by the likes of Russell Westbrook (everyone's MVP favourite or co-favourite, it seems), Kevin Durant, James Harden, LeBron James, Anthony Davis and more.
And this isn't to suggest that either of Lowry and DeRozan should or will win the award at the end of the year. It's just that it seems strange that two players having career-years for an Eastern Conference finalist team that is hitting never-before-seen peaks in offensive efficiency while on pace to win 59 games is doing all of it with so little fanfare league-wide.
For the first dozen games DeRozan was doing things – like posting 10 30-point outings – not done since Michael Jordan was in their physical prime. For the past dozen or so games Lowry is doing things — like hitting 59 per cent of their three-point attempts — that Steph Curry (34 per cent from deep over their last 10, but who's counting) would envy and would likely have generated a Twitter hashtag by now and a sponsored spot on ESPN's Sports Center.
So far? Silence.
“You can't control that,” said Raptors head coach Dwane Casey about the lack of attention Lowry — the only player in the NBA averaging at least 21 points, seven rebounds and 1.5 steals while shooting at least 44 per cent from deep — has generated. “All you can do is continue to win, play at a high level, continue to do it and hopefully the US media will see it and recognize it. We're biased here, but he's played at such a level it should be talked about it. But I can't control it, Kyle can't control it. The one thing they can control is to continue to put forth the effort to help us win and almost embarrass everybody else to [talk] about it.”
But the list of Raptors deserving attention for their individual accomplishments in the context of team success doesn't begin or end with DeRozan and Lowry.
DeRozan made a point of mentioning Terrence Ross as a viable Sixth Man Award candidate after Ross rescued the Raptors with 25 points off the bench against the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night. Only six players in the NBA are averaging at least 19.9 points per 36 minutes and shooting at least 44 per cent from three, but Ross is the only one doing it off the bench. Throw in their 1.7 steals and Ross is the only player in any role providing that combination of ball-hawking, scoring and perimeter marksmanship on a per 36 basis.
But while most Sixth Man lists include Jamal Crawford of the Clippers, Zach Randolph of Memphis, Lou Williams of the Lakers or Eric Gordon with Houston, they don't mention Ross and the Raptors.
“What Terrence does for us is incredible,” said DeRozan. “For me not to hear he's a Sixth Man candidate, it's kind of unfair because without them coming off the bench and doing the things they do, we wouldn't be who we are and be in the position we are now.”
How about Coach of the Year?
Dwane Casey is one of the most likeable and media-friendly bench bosses in the NBA. They give of their time freely. He's also turned a team that was within a hair's breadth of being blown up for tanking purposes three years ago into one of the most consistent winners in the league that is now putting up unheard-of offensive numbers.
Yet all that gets them only one mention as a Coach of the Year candidate and third place at that, even though he's managed the NBA's third youngest roster and features a raw rookie in Pascal Siakam starting at power-forward; has been missing its only significant off-season acquisition in Jared Sullinger and lost its best defensive player from a year ago — Bismack Biyombo — to free agency.
In that sense, Casey fits right in with their team: overlooked and under-appreciated.
“That's just the way it is when you're in Toronto,” said Patrick Patterson, the anchor of the Raptors' unheralded second unit. “It's been that way since I've been here. I don't think it will ever change, but as long as the people around [us] understand it. that's all that matters.”
The solution to all of it is to keep winning, of course.
“We do,” DeRozan said when asked if their club deserved more attention than they've received to this point. “[But] I'm not going to sit up here and cry about it or mention about why [we're] not in it; it just gives [us] more fuel to keep winning, keep doing what we know how to do and everything will figure itself out.”
Here in America, a nation founded on the principles of fairness and equality, there is a terrible injustice going on. In our country, a country where we thought people were free, a group is being horribly oppressed. That group, of course, is fast food chicken chain Chick-fil-A. Their God-given right to oppress gay people has been totally ruined by the decision of some people to say totally mean things about them. Fortunately, Mike Huckabee is here to save the day and defend Chick-fil-A's right to be anti-gay!
Yay!
Huckabee isn't just saving a day, he's creating one! “Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day!”
But, let's back up. For those of you who don't know why Chick-fil-A needs to be appreciated, the story is this; Chick-fil-A is actually a super religious corporation. How religious? Religious enough to always be closed on Sundays…and also give millions of dollars to anti-gay groups over the years. In case people weren't getting the message from that, CEO Dan Cathy did a couple interviews last week in which they helpfully explained that gay people marrying the love of their life was “inviting God's judgment on our nation.”
America responded quickly. Comedians began mocking the brand around the clock, the Mayor of Boston vowed to keep the chain out of their city, the Jim Henson Company has decided to stop making toys for their kid's meals, and more.
As you can imagine, this is in danger of hurting Chick-fil-A's feelings (read: “sales”). Fortunately, the good, honest people of the country can unite to protect the restaurant thanks to Mike Huckabee's Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day!
From their Facebook event:
“I have been incensed at the vitriolic assaults on the Chick Fil-A company because the CEO, Dan Cathy, made comments recently in which they affirmed their view that the Biblical view of marriage should be upheld. The Cathy family, let by Chick Fil-A founder Truett Cathy, are a wonderful Christian family who are committed to operating the company with Biblical principles and whose story is the true American success story. Starting at age 46 Truett Cathy built Chick Fil-A into a $4 billion a year enterprise with over 1600 stores. At 91, they are still active in the company, but their son Dan runs it day to day as CEO.It's a great American story that is being smeared by vicious hate speech and intolerant bigotry from the left. … I ask you to join me in speaking out on Wednesday, August 1 ‘Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day.' No one is being asked to make signs, speeches, or openly demonstrate. The goal is simple: Let's affirm a business that operates on Christian principles and whose executives are willing to take a stand for the Godly values we espouse by simply showing up and eating at Chick Fil-A on Wednesday, August 1. Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same-sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we're considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant. This effort is not being launched by the Chick Fil-A company and no one from the company or family is involved in proposing or promoting it.”
So gather 'round, good people! Eat your chicken proudly, look to the sky, and shout to the heavens, “Hello, world! In the year 2012, I still somehow believe that keeping a group of people from having the same rights as I is not bigoted! It's Christian! Yummy yummy chicken!”

New Delhi: Yoga-guru-turned-business person Baba Ramdev has now set their eyes on the packaged drinking water market. Their company, Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, is preparing to launch Divya Jal packaged drinking water—sourced from the foothills of the Himalayas—across north India this Diwali.
The company will make Divya Jal available nationwide over the next three to six months, said Ramdev's spokesperson, S.K. Tijarawala. The sales target for 2018-19 is Rs1,000 crore.
The company will start the bottling of drinking water at its factories in Haridwar and Lucknow, said Tijarawala. Patanjali may look at other options, such as a third-party contract with bottling companies and joint ventures, and may also look at reviving stressed bottling plants as volume grows, they added.
While this will be a commercial launch of packaged drinking water, Patanjali has been bottling drinking water at a factory in Lucknow managed by Patanjali Gramodyog, a sister concern of Patanjali Ayurved. This was not sold in the market, said a senior executive of a beverage company, who asked not to be named.
The Lucknow plant is capable of bottling 100,000 litres of water every day. Tijarawala, however, declined to comment on the pricing of Divya Jal.
Patanjali is not be the first company to market drinking water that has been sourced from the foothills of the Himalayas.
NourishCo, a joint venture between Tata group firm Tata Global Beverages Ltd and PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt. Ltd, sells Himalayan branded packaged drinking water that the company claims to have sourced from the foothills of the Himalayas.
The packaged drinking water market in India was estimated at Rs7,040 crore in 2016 and is projected to reach Rs15,080 crore in 2021, according to research firm Euromonitor International.
Bisleri, a brand owned by Mumbai-based business person Ramesh Chauhan's Bisleri International Pvt. Ltd, leads the bottled water market with an estimated 24% value share. Other key brands include Aquafina, marketed by American food and beverages company PepsiCo Inc, and Kinley, sold by American beverages maker Coca-Cola Co.
In June 2016, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) raised concerns about quality and safety of packaged drinking water sold in the country as a majority of the bottling units did not have clearance from the regulator.
According to FSSAI findings in June 2016, there were 5,842 registered water packaging units, of which only 1,495 units had licences from both Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and FSSAI, while the remaining 4,347 units were operating only with BIS certification. FSSAI had, on 23 June 2016, said all bottling units will have to secure clearance from it.
Patanjali has been in diversification mode in the recent past. After food, Ayurvedic medicines and cosmetics, the company earlier this month announced its foray into the private security business and the branded apparel market.
Patanjali will start selling branded apparel for men, women and kids under the brand name Paridhan starting April 2018, with a target to generate sales of Rs5,000 crore in the first year, Mint reported on 3 August.
Patanjali Ayurved reported sales of Rs10,561 crore in the year to 31 March, almost five times its 2014-15 sales of Rs2,006 crore. It aims to cross Rs20,000-25,000 crore in sales by 31 March 2018, Ramdev said on 4 May.
From the end of October through the New Year and onto Valentine's Day, it's easy to forget that the holidays we celebrate are simply cultural constructs that we can choose to engage in — or not. The concepts and ideas we celebrate — like our spiritual beliefs and daily habits — are a choice, though sometimes it feels like we "have" to celebrate them, even if we don't feel like it.
Culture is ours to do with as we choose, and that means that we can add, subtract, or edit celebrations or holidays as we see fit — because you and me and everyone reading this makes up our culture, and it is defined by us, for us, after all.
If you want to add a new and different perspective to your life, there are plenty of other ways to recognize joy and beauty outside American traditions. From Scandinavia to Japan, India and Germany, the concepts below may strike a nerve with you and inspire your own personal or familial celebration or — as is the case with a couple of these for me — sound like an acknowledgement of something you have long felt, but didn't have a word for.
Friluftsliv
A hiker sits atop Trolltunga, or 'troll's tongue,' a famous rock formation in southwestern Norway. (Photo: Shutterstock)
Friluftsliv translates directly from Norwegian as "free air life," which doesn't quite do it justice. Coined relatively recently, in 1859, it is the concept that being outside is good for human beings' mind and spirit. "It is a term in Norway that is used often to describe a way of life that is spent exploring and appreciating nature," Anna Stoltenberg, culture coordinator for Sons of Norway, a U.S.-based Norwegian heritage group, told MNN. Other than that, it's not a strict definition: it can include sleeping outside, hiking, taking photographs or meditating, playing or dancing outside, for adults or kids. It doesn't require any special equipment, includes all four seasons, and needn't cost much money. Practicing friluftsliv could be as simple as making a commitment to walking in a natural area five days a week, or doing a day-long hike once a month.
Shinrin-yoku
Spending time in the forest can lower stress. (Photo: Semmick Photo/Shutterstock)
Shinrin-yoku is a Japanese term that means "forest bathing" and unlike the Norwegian translation above, this one seems a perfect language fit (though a pretty similar idea). The idea being that spending time in the forest and natural areas is good preventative medicine, since it lowers stress, which causes or exacerbates some of our most intractable health issues. As MNN's Catie Leary details, this isn't just a nice idea — there's science behind it: "The "magic" behind forest bathing boils down to the naturally produced allelochemic substances known as phytoncides, which are kind of like pheromones for plants. Their job is to help ward off pesky insects and slow the growth of fungi and bacteria. When humans are exposed to phytoncides, these chemicals are scientifically proven to lower blood pressure, relieve stress and boost the growth of cancer-fighting white blood cells. Some common examples of plants that give off phytoncides include garlic, onion, pine, tea tree and oak, which makes sense considering their potent aromas."
Hygge
Hygge is a mental state of togetherness and coziness. (Photo: Shutterstock)
Hygge is the idea that helps Denmark regularly rate as one of the happiest countries in the world — Danes have regularly been some of the most joyful in the world for over 40 years that the U.S. has been studying them — despite long, dark winters. Loosely translated at "togetherness," and "coziness," though it's not a physical state, it's a mental one. According to VisitDenmark (the country's official tourism site): "The warm glow of candlelight is hygge. Friends and family — that's hygge too. And let's not forget the eating and drinking — preferably sitting around the table for hours on end discussing the big and small things in life." Hygge's high season is winter, and Christmas lights, candles galore, and other manifestations of warmth and light, including warm alcoholic beverages, are key to the concept.
Still a little confused and wondering how you could cultivate hygge in your life? This Danish NPR commenter sums up some specifics: "Hygge is a deep sense of cosy that can originate from many different sources. Here is a good example from my life : a cloudy winter Sunday morning at the country house, fire in the stove and 20 candles lit to dispel the gloom. My husband, puppy and I curled up on our sheepskins wearing felt slippers, warm snuggly clothes and hands clasped around hot mugs of tea. A full day ahead with long walks on the cold beach, back for pancake lunch, reading, more snuggling, etc. This is a very hyggligt day." Now that sounds do-able, doesn't it?
Wabi-sabi
Wabi-sabi is an acceptance of the toll life takes on us. (Photo: markuliasz/Shutterstock)
Wabi-sabi is the Japanese idea of embracing the imperfect, of celebrating the worn, the cracked, the patinaed, both as a decorative concept and a spiritual one — it's an acceptance of the toll that life takes on us all. As I wrote about it earlier this year, "If we can learn to love the things that already exist, for all their chips and cracks, their patinas, their crooked lines or tactile evidence of being made by someone's hands instead of a machine, from being made from natural materials that vary rather than perfect plastic, we wouldn't need to make new stuff, reducing our consumption (and its concurrent energy use and inevitable waste), cutting our budgets, and saving some great stories for future generations." We might also be less stressed, and more attentive to the details, which are the keys to mindfulness.
Kaizen
The newer concept of kaizen is the idea of continuous improvement. (Photo: Santiago Cornejo/Shutterstock)
Kaizen is another Japanese concept, one that means "continuous improvement," and could be taken to mean the opposite of wabi-sabi (though as you'll see, it depends on the interpretation). It's a very new idea, only coined in 1986, and generally used in business circumstances. As this tutorial details, "Kaizen is a system that involves every employee, from upper management to the cleaning crew. Everyone is encouraged to come up with small improvement suggestions on a regular basis. This is not a once a month or once a year activity. It is continuous. Japanese companies, such as Toyota and Canon, a total of 60 to 70 suggestions per employee per year are written down, shared and implemented." These are regular, small improvements, not major changes. Applied to your own life, it could mean daily or weekly check-ins about goals, as opposed to making New Year's resolutions, or a more organized path based on small changes toward weight loss, a personal project or a hobby.
Gemütlichkeit
Gemütlichkeit is a German word that means almost the same thing as hygge, and also has its peak usage during the winter. In fact, some linguists posit that the word (and concept) of hygge likely came from the German idea. Blogger Constanze's entry on the German Language Blog for "Untranslatable German Words" describes how the word means more than just cozy: "A soft chair in a coffee shop might be considered ‘cosy'. But sit in that chair surrounded by close friends and a hot cup of tea, while soft music plays in the background, and that sort of scene is what you'd call gemütlich."
Jugaad
The concept of jugaad is an innovative fix to solve a problem. (Photo: Michal Zieba/Shutterstock)
Jugaad is a Hindi word that means "an innovative fix" or a "repair derived from ingenuity," — think a jury-rigged sled for snowy fun, or a bicycle chain repaired with some duct tape. It's a frequently used word in India where frugal fixes are revered. But the idea has further merit beyond figuring out solutions to get by with less. It also encapsulates the spirit of doing something innovative. As the authors of Jugaad Innovation write in Forbes, they see jugaad in many other places than the repair shop: "In Kenya, for instance, entrepreneurs have invented a device that enables bicycle riders to charge their cellphones while pedaling. In the Philippines, Illac Diaz has deployed A Litre of Light — a recycled plastic bottle containing bleach-processed water that refracts sunlight, producing the equivalent of a 55-watt light bulb — in thousands of makeshift houses in off-the-grid shantytowns. And in Lima, Peru (with high humidity and only 1 inch of rain per year), an engineering college has designed advertising billboards that can convert humid air into potable water."
Jugaad's idea of frugal innovation can definitely be applied in the individual life — what about setting aside a half a day twice a year where everyone in your family fixes something that needs repair? You'll save money, spend time together, test problem-solving skills, and get a sense of accomplishment from repairing instead of buying new.
I'd like to integrate some of these ideas into my own life. Over the last few years I have dropped Christmas and Easter (I've been an atheist for over 25 years now) and replaced them with a Solstice celebration; I have remade New Year's into a quiet, reflective time (the antithesis of a party); and have incorporated an appreciation and gratefulness aspect into my almost-daily meditation routine. I've kept Thanksgiving, though mine is vegetarian, so the focus is on the harvest and thanks and not killing a turkey. And I celebrate Halloween some years, when I feel into it, and not if I don't. And forget Valentine's Day!
Because I don't love some of our existing holidays, I'd like to add celebrations to my list — luckily I need not come up with them by myself, but can look to other cultures for inspiration. I actually started practicing hygge last winter and I felt it really helped me through the darkest days of the year. I may formalize it a bit by creating a "start" and "end" date to the practice. Wabi-sabi is also very appealing to me, as I tend towards perfectionism (which also tends to make me miserable), and it's an idea that seems like it might become part of my seasonal cleaning and organizing time (along with Jugaad).
7 cultural concepts we don't have in the U.S.
These ideas could improve your day or inspire you to think differently in your day-to-day life.
A large bipedal dinosaur once known only from fossils of its long arms and a few isolated bone fragments turns out to be a hump-backed, big-bellied beast almost the size of Tyrannosaurus rex, suggest Mongolian fossils newly described in Nature1. Few scientists could have imagined the behemoth's distinctive combination of features from the smattering of bones previously in hand.
Nature Podcast Nature News & Views editor Marian Turner asks vertebrate palaeontologist Thomas Holtz, Jr. what makes Deinocheirus so unusual. You may need a more recent browser or to install the latest version of the Adobe Flash Plugin.
“This is an entirely new body plan” for such dinosaurs, says Stephen Brusatte, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.
Fossils of Deinocheirus mirificus — a pastiche of Greek and Latin meaning 'unusual horrible hand' — were first unearthed in the summer of 1965 in the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia. Along with a few rib and vertebra fragments, the remains included a remarkable set of shoulder girdles and 2.4-metre-long forelimbs, the longest yet found for a bipedal animal of any era (although some flying animals, notably pterosaurs, had longer wings).
Eventually, scientists placed Deinocheirus in a subgroup of theropod dinosaurs known as ornithomimosaurs ('bird-mimicking lizards') — which makes them relatively close kin to fierce predators such as T. rex and Allosaurus, says Yuong-Nam Lee, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources in Daejeon, South Korea, and a co-author of the study.
Michael Skrepnick
Near-complete skeleton
In expeditions to the Gobi Desert in the past decade, Lee and their colleagues have unearthed the 70-million-year-old fossils of two more individuals of the species from sites near to where the original 1965 specimen was discovered. Together, those remains — along with some bones stolen by poachers before Lee and their team found the fossils, but since recovered from a private collection — account for about 95% of the creature's skeleton, they note.
The newer-found bones differ from those of other ornithomimosaurs in several unexpected ways. Most of the spinal vertebrae have blade-like projections that extended upward and served as anchors for a network of ligaments that probably helped to support the immense weight of the creature's abdomen. The researchers estimate that Deinocheirus was about 11 metres long and tipped the scales at more than 6.3 tonnes.
“This is definitely an unusual animal,” says Thomas Holtz, Jr., a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who wrote an accompanying News & Views piece2. “It had more of a ‘beer belly' than your typical ornithomimosaur,” they suggest.
No teeth
Deinocheirus had a skull more than a metre long. Although the creature lacked teeth, it had a keratinous beak that could be used to nip at tender vegetation. A deep lower jaw probably housed an immense tongue that could have helped to suck up plants from the bottoms of rivers and lakes. Stomach contents preserved in the fossils, including fish vertebrae and scales, suggest that Deinocheirus also consumed large quantities of aquatic prey.
As well as its wide hips and big feet, Deinocheirus had broad toes, which helped to prevent it from sinking into soft sediments while foraging, suggest the researchers. The last bone in each of its toes was flattened and had a blunt tip, unlike the tapered tips seen in the toes of all other theropod dinosaurs.
Using data gleaned from the fossils, Lee and their colleagues have created a video that shows how Deinocheirus might have looked and, more amusingly, how it may have walked.
“This creature wasn't built for speed,” says Brusatte. “That's pretty obvious.”
Electricity crews are scrambling to restore power to more than 40,000 homes and business hit by stormy weather in Sydney's south on Saturday.
After a sunny start to the day, the expected storms rolled in, with the Bureau of Meteorology issuing a severe thunderstorm warning for large parts of north-western Sydney.
Spectacular lightning and some hail was reported across chunks of western Sydney, and electricity company Ausgrid has reported that emergency crews are working to restore power to 40,000 residents in the city's south from Caringbah to Waterfall after the storm cut power to high voltage cables in the area.

Endeavour Energy also reported that power has been cut to more than 18,000 homes and businesses across western Sydney due to the storm late this afternoon. That includes 6000 homes between Merrylands and Guildford, 3000 in the Hills district and 1600 in Liverpool.
NICK MOIR A massive storm hammer north-western Sydney earlier in the week.
A spokesperson for Endeavour said emergency crews "are being hampered in patrolling these areas to make safe and commence the restoration process by ongoing lightning and heavy rain".
"Until these patrols are undertaken it is not possible to give an estimate of the time it will take to restore supply and we would appreciate affected customers being patient," they said.
Ausgrid crews were also working to restore power to about 1400 residents in Wahroonga and Waitara.
Weatherzone meteorologist Sam Terry said a severe thunderstorm had led to "significant rainfalls" in parts of western Sydney, including more than 15 millimetres in a 10 minute period near Badgerys Creek.
"That's more than enough to lead to flash flooding," they said.
Terry said the worst of the rainfall hit in places like Penrith, which saw 40 millimetres, and Toongabbie, which saw about 3 millimetres.
A "severe" gust of wind of 98 kilometres per hour was also recorded at Badgerys Creek, while Bankstown saw gusts of about 80 kilometres.
"You're likely to see some branches ripping off trees or loose roof tiles being moved around," they said.
The State Emergency Services has received about 300 calls for assistance in the last few hours, as well as six flood rescues, with spokesperson Phil Campbell saying some callers were being greeted by a busy tone because the call centre was being "maxed out".
"Such is the volume of requests for help we're getting," they said.
It is the second storm Sydney has suffered through in two days, with Campbell saying the majority of the focus had again been in the west.
"We had 800 calls for assistance last night, so you could say it's 1100 for the weekend," they said.
The Bureau of Meteorology issued and updated warning just after 6pm saying that further storms were still possible.
Severe thunderstorm warnings are also covering parts of the south-west including Camden, Oran Park and Picton.
The new protective regulations announced today by USFWS will protect grizzly bears from some of the most wanton and misguided methods of killing them, as well as black bears, wolves, and coyotes on our public lands in Alaska . Photo by Alamy
This is a landmark day for some of the nation's most majestic, recognizable, and woefully mistreated wild animals. And “landmark” barely says enough.
I'm delighted to report that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has followed the National Park Service in prohibiting some of the most wanton and misguided methods utilized to slaughter grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, and coyotes on our public lands in Alaska. The new protective regulations were promulgated this day, and cover all of Alaska's National Wildlife Refuges.
These are vast lands, in many ways among the most important wildlands remaining in the world, and they belong to all 300 million-plus Americans. Each of us holds a piece of the deed to these 76-million refuge acres.
With ownership comes responsibility. Meaning that each of us is responsible for the management—the treatment—of the animals who live on these lands.
For years, that's been a story of unremitting barbarism—shocking comes to mind. Untold numbers of bears and thousands of wolves have been gunned down, shot from the air, killed over bait barrels of meat scraps and jelly donuts, clubbed or shot in their dens, hunted down with lights at night in Alaska. Slaughtered in the name of a stated government mandate of “intensive predator management.”
A glance at the biographies of the seven members of Alaska Board of Game explains the singular and obsessive vision that rules this body: A Safari Club trophy hunter, a trapper, a hunter and guide, an NRA member with a background in hunting and trapping, an “actively involved” member of the NRA, a trapper and bowhunter, and finally a hunting lodge manager.
Still though, why such an assault on these grand animals?
Famed outdoor writer Ted Williams put it this way: The Alaska government has waged war on bears and wolves in “a vain attempt to convert the state to an ever-expanding Stop-and-Shop for moose and caribou hunters.” That's right, fewer wild predators were supposed to mean more moose and caribou for human hunters like those on the Board of Game—or so the cockeyed thinking went.
The fact that credible scientists have shot holes in that line of reasoning has not stopped the Board of Game from pressing on with its bloody war for decades. The fact that wildlife watchers bring far more money than trophy hunters into the state economy has not stopped it. Common sense and changing public values have not stopped it.
But now the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has stopped it—on federal wildlife refuges. Those millions of us who take seriously our responsibilities to these animals can lift our eyes. Yes, ordinary hunting is still permitted on these “refuges” and some biologists say the regulations have a shortcoming here and there that will need fixing, but some of the most chilling abuses of these great creatures will no longer occur in our names, and Alaskans resoundingly agree.
But…
Yes, there is a “but” to this story. As regular readers here know, some die-hard reactionaries are trying to engineer a congressional coup to deprive the Fish and Wildlife Service of its responsibility to manage national lands in the national interest.
No deal. We need to uphold these regulations. Contact your federal lawmakers (you can find their contact information here). Politely state the obvious: Public lands are meant to be managed in trust for all of us, not for state boards, not exclusively for trophy hunters, not for any single interest.
Back in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated Pelican Island in Florida as the inaugural national wildlife refuge. Today, there are more than 560 refuges and related wetland management districts. They encompass an area of 150 million acres.
Alaskan refuges account for just over half that total. Together, they are an endowment we share, and which we all pay to support. The animals who live there deserve better than they have been receiving. I'm happy that they're getting a real measure of protective justice now, and I send our thanks to President Obama and their U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for adopting this new, humane, scientifically-sound, and ecologically-minded policy.

New Study Is Latest to Find That Higher Rates of Gun Ownership Lead to Higher Rates of Violent Crime Data shows that states with the top rates of gun possession have nearly three times the rate of gun murders compared to states with the fewest guns.
A Gallup poll taken last October found that around 63 percent of Americans believe that having a gun in the house makes their home safer. It's a perception in keeping with a constant refrain from the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights proponents, who have steadfastly pushed the idea that a society with more guns leads to less crime, and that “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”
But those arguments, however persuasive on the surface, do not withstand empirical scrutiny. Instead, the most reliable academic analysis consistently shows that gun ownership is more often a catalyst than a deterrent to crime.
Last week, amid heightened scrutiny of gun violence in the wake of the Charleston church shootings, a group of researchers released the latest study on the correlation between firearm prevalence and crime rates. Their findings only add to the growing evidence against the “More Guns, Less Crime” hypothesis.
The authors of “Firearm Ownership and Violent Crime in the U.S.” are researchers from Boston's Children Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health. They set out to gauge the effect of firearm-ownership rates on specific types of violent gun crimes. To do so, they used national gun-ownership surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and criminal data taken from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), a large annual database administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
The data covers all 50 states for the years 2001, 2002, and 2004, the only years for which the CDC firearm-ownership statistics are available. The study then sorted the states into quintiles according to their level of firearm ownership. After controlling for a variety of demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors, the authors analyzed each group of states and their rates of the following crimes: robbery committed with a firearm, nonfatal assault with a firearm, firearm homicide, and overall homicide.
According to the “More Guns, Less Crime” hypothesis, states with higher levels of gun ownership would expect to see lower crime rates in those categories. By contrast, the study found that states with the lowest rates of firearm ownership (Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, California, Florida, Illinois, and Maryland) had significantly lower rates of firearm-related assault and robbery, firearm homicide, and overall homicide.
States with the highest gun-ownership levels (Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, Arizona, West Virginia, North Dakota, Idaho, Mississippi, and Alabama), meanwhile, had 6.8 times the rate of firearm assaults, 2.8 times the rate of firearm homicides, and twice the rate of overall homicides than states with the lowest gun-ownership levels.
In the category of robbery with a firearm, the relationship between gun ownership rates was less clear: The study did find that robbery rates rose with gun-ownership rates, but in some states the increases were not statistically significant.
For every other type of crime examined by the authors, however, the conclusion was the same: more guns, more crime.
Some gun proponents may argue that “correlation doesn't equal causation,” that perhaps gun ownership isn't causing an increase in crime, but instead crime is causing an increase in gun ownership. In other words, people living in high-crime areas may be purchasing guns for protection. This possibility, known as “reverse causation,” was preempted by the authors of the new study, who showed that a state's firearm-ownership rates in 2001 strongly predict violent crime rates in 2002 and 2004. The most coherent explanation is that higher rates of gun ownership lead to increases in crime, rather than the other way around.
Undergirding the idea that expanding gun ownership deters and prevents crimes is the belief that the “bad guy with a gun” will usually be a random assailant, someone the would-be victim has never encountered before or does not know personally. But here again the hard numbers are at odds with perceptions. Nearly 70 percent of homicides involve guns, and the majority of all homicide victims know their killers; among female homicide victims, 93 percent are killed by a familiar person.
Samsung has announced it's ending production of the Galaxy Note 7 around the world, pulling the plug on the phone after a months-long controversy over its defective, dangerous batteries. "Taking our customer's safety as our highest priority, we have decided to halt sales and production of the Galaxy Note 7," said Samsung in a statement. The announcement follows yesterday's news that the company is recalling all Note 7 devices, including the supposedly safe replacement phones.
Samsung issued the worldwide recall yesterday after at at least five replacement Note 7 handsets caught fire over the past week. "Samsung will ask all carrier and retail partners globally to stop sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7," said the company yesterday. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission commended the decision, with chairperson Elliot Kaye saying: "It is the right move for Samsung to suspend the sale and exchange of all Galaxy Note 7s."
"Taking our customer's safety as our highest priority"
Consumers using any Note 7 (including replacement units) are urged to power them down immediately and return them to wherever they were originally purchased. Carriers have issued statements letting customers know that replacement Note 7s can be exchanged for another handset from Samsung or other manufacturers.
The Note 7 was originally released in August to highly positive reviews, but before the month was out, the first reports of the phone's battery catching fire began to emerge. Samsung issued a recall of the original device on September 2nd and that same month began shipping out replacement Note 7s to carriers. However, these too have proved to be a fire risk, leading to the company's expected — but still momentous — decision to cease production altogether.
Although Samsung and the rest of the mobile industry will be dissecting what exactly went wrong here for years to come, early reports suggest that the fault might have been caused by the Korean company's desire to beat this year's "dull" iPhone. Samsung is certainly not out of the mobile business despite this disaster, but recovery will be slow. The company's shares tumbled 8 percent today, its biggest one-day decline in nearly a decade, with analysts estimating the recall could end up costing as much as $17 billion.
Hidden under black netting in the remote Mexican desert... the largest ever marijuana plantation (even with toilets for the workers)
Discovery comes as Mexico drug violence takes upswing
More than 40,000 people have died in drug violence in Mexico since late 2006.
Mexican soldiers discovered the largest marijuana plantation in the country's history, hidden under black cloth in the middle of the desert.
The 300-acre plantation is four times larger than the previous record discovery by authorities and workers had even installed toilet facilities, the Defence Department said.
The towering pot plants sheltered under black screen-cloth in a huge square on the floor of the Baja California desert, more than 150 miles south of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego.
Hidden: This desert plantation looks innocent enough but underneath the black tarpaulin was the largest marijuana farm in Mexico's history A house and facilities sit uncovered at one end of the massive plantation
Army general Alfonso Duarte said the screening, which is often used by regular farmers to protect crops from too much sun or heat, made it difficult to smell what was growing underneath.
It was only when soldiers on the ground reached the isolated area on Tuesday that they found thousands of pot plants as high as 2.5 meter tall.
ESCALATING DRUG VIOLENCE IN MEXICO
More than 40,000 people have died in drug violence in Mexico since late 2006.
Over 9,300 people have been gunned down in Ciudad Juarez alone since early 2008 when the rival Juarez and Sinaloa cartels began an all-out war for rich trafficking routes. That conflict has unleashed further violence as local gangs battle over street corner drug rackets, and turn to kidnapping and extortion. The Mexican military and federal police sent to curb the mayhem are also blamed by many residents for killings and other abuses.
The average height of the plants was about 1.5 yards (meters).
'We estimate that in this area, approximately 60 people were working. When they saw the military personnel, they fled,' Gen Duarte told reporters.
A few were later reportedly detained at a nearby roadblock, but they added no arrests were made at the scene.
They said traffickers could have harvested about 120 tons of marijuana from the plantation, worth about 1.8 billion pesos or about $160 million.
The discovery comes as drug related violence in Mexico's troubled border states has taken a dramatic upswing over the last few months.
Last Friday At least 17 people were killed in a bar massacre night in the northern Mexico city of Monterrey when riflemen opened fire on bystanders and staff.

Soldiers walk through the biggest marijuana plantation found in Mexico in San Quintin And on Monday 10 decapitated bodies were found in the northern Mexican city of Torreon. The bodies were dumped in the back of a truck with their heads scattered across the city. Authorities said the killers left a message directed at another gang.
The cartels have also become more brazen in the face of ongoing efforts by the Mexican army to curb their operations. Yesterday, two separate raids by Mexican government special forces left nine gunmen dead. Raids on a Monterrey weapons training ground left four dead, while five more were killed after an SUV carrying members of another cartel opened fire on troops in the town of Cadereyta. Monterrey, a major industrial hub, has seen a spike of violence since the Gulf and Zeta cartels began fighting for control of drug traffic there two years ago. On Thursday Mexican journalist Armando Rodriguez, renowned for their coverage of gangland slayings in their hometown of Ciudad Juarez, lay dead in a casket, shot by suspected cartel hitmen. As their colleague Jorge Luis Aguirre drove to the funeral home in the dismal border city to pay their last respects, their cell phone rang. The husky voice delivered a chilling warning: 'You're next.' Mexican soldiers discovered the plantation in a remote desert surrounded by cactuses, Soldiers discovered toilets on the plantation
Soldiers stand guard at the biggest marijuana plantation found in Mexico
'I left Ciudad Juarez in panic the same day,' said Aguirre, the former editor of news website La Polaka.
The newsman joined a growing number of Mexicans fleeing raging drug cartel violence in and around Ciudad Juarez to begin a long-shot bid for political asylum next door in the United States.
Video of the plantation showed a sophisticated system of piped-in irrigation to support the plants, which Gen Duarte said was fed by two wells.
The plantation also included some wooden outbuildings, presumably for use by people caring for the plants.
Troops will destroy the fields by burning them, Duarte said.
While it's unknown how much of Mexican drug cartels' income comes from marijuana, recent discoveries suggest it remains a large-scale trade.
Guarded: the plantation is now under heavy protection in case any of the cartel return The house and facilities at the far right are dwarfed by the size of the crop
Last October, Mexican authorities made their largest-ever seizure of marijuana packaged for sale, a record 148 tons (134 metric tons) found in a number of tractor trailers and houses in Tijuana.
They appeared to make up a major distribution center traced directly to Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, Mexico's most-wanted fugitive, who has expanded the reach of their Sinaloa cartel along the U.S.-Mexico border since escaping from prison in 2001.
In November, U.S. and Mexican investigators found two long, sophisticated tunnels under the border between Baja California and California, along with more than 40 tons of marijuana in and around the tunnels.
An army helicopter casts a shadow over parts of the biggest marijuana plantation
The tunnels ran about 2,000 feet from Mexico to San Diego and were equipped with lighting, ventilation and a rail system for drugs to be carried on a small cart.
The biggest ever plantation in Mexico prior to this week's discovery was in northern Chihuahua state in 1984.
U.S. officials say they believe the tunnels also were the work of the Sinaloa cartel.
While the Arellano Felix or Tijuana cartel long dominated the drug trade in Baja California, the cartel has been greatly weakened by government hits on its leadership, and authorities say there are signs that the Sinaloa cartel now also operates in the area.
In the ongoing controversy of the IRS targeting Tea Party groups, CNN jumped all over breaking news that helped the Democratic narrative but was silent when developments occurred that boosted the Republican criticism of the agency.
When news broke Tuesday that liberal groups, not just conservative groups, were flagged by the IRS for potential scrutiny, CNN hammered the story and proclaimed it a "new wave of controversy" that was "rocking Capitol Hill." The network repeatedly quoted Democrat Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.) slamming the inspector general for previously claiming that the agency unfairly targeted Tea Party groups.
However, the very next day the inspector general responded in a letter that conservative groups were indeed targeted more than liberal groups, and CNN was nowhere to be found on the story.
Although many different groups appeared on an IRS watch list, the inspector general insisted that far more Tea Party groups received "extra scrutiny" from the IRS than did the liberal groups.
CNN.com picked up on the letter, but CNN gave it no coverage. Tom Cohen wrote on CNN.com:
"Another category of the BOLO lists also had liberal-themed criteria including "progressives," but that category didn't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity faced by conservative groups, according to a letter to the panel this week by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George."
And as Cohen reported, the acting IRS chief admitted to a double standard:
"Under tough questioning Thursday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Werfel acknowledged that the different BOLO categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation."
CNN mentioned on Thursday morning that the IRS hearing on Capitol Hill would take place, but made no report of Werfel's acknowledgment or the inspector general's letter. New Day co-host Michaela Pereira completely ignored the IG's letter in their Thursday news brief:
"Acting IRS commissioner Danny Werfel likely to be grilled today by a House committee on why they did not reveal earlier that the IRS was targeting conservatives and progressives."
On Wednesday night, OutFront host Erin Burnett bizarrely noted that the agency "can't catch a break" amidst scandal: "Well, the IRS can't catch a break. A new watchdog report that shows the agency wasn't keeping an eye on employees with business credit cards. "
Again, as NewsBusters reported, CNN's Dana Bash jumped all over the news that the IRS "targeted" both liberal and conservative groups, and they repeatedly quoted a Democrat slamming the inspector general for misleading the public on the controversy. However, when the inspector general responded that conservative groups were indeed targeted more than liberal groups, Bash was nowhere to be found on the story.
Google's taking small steps to more intimately connect your Android phone and desktop computer. The search company has rolled out a new feature that lets you send directions, notes, reminders, and more directly from your browser to your phone.
If your Android device is updated and has the right settings enabled (see this help article for details), you can simply type "send a note to my phone" or "send directions to my phone" directly into the search bar. Doing so will open up a little Google Now-style card that will let you type in your note or specify the directions that you're looking for. Google will then send the data to your phone as a notification. Other than directions or notes, you can also send reminders, set an alarm, or instantly find the location of your phone directly from the Google search bar on your desktop.
The new feature can be seen as an extension of Google's already-great syncing between its Chrome desktop browser and its Android operating system. For years, recent searches and tabs have been seamlessly synced between the two, and Google Maps searches are also shared across both platforms. Before that, Google used a browser extension called Chrome to Phone to handle sharing data from your computer to your phone. The new system, built directly into the Google search bar, is far simpler, and can be seen as a response to Handoff, a highly-publicized feature in iOS 8 that makes it easier to pick up where you left off when switching between your phone and computer.

Rory MacDonald had a pretty simple plan going into 2017, and it began with not accepting a fight until the summer.
MacDonald (18-4) became one of the most significant free-agent acquisitions in Bellator MMA history last August, when they signed a multifight deal with the promotion after a six-year relationship with the UFC.
Editor's Picks Thomson hasn't forgotten Chandler entering Bellator return At 38, Josh Thomson is not only training smarter ahead of Saturday's return against Patricky Freire, thoughts of a much-delayed showdown with Bellator champion Michael Chandler loom large.

It was immediately announced upon their signing, however, that MacDonald's promotional debut wouldn't come until well into 2017. The 27-year-old required time to heal a badly broken nose from their memorable, five-round war against Robbie Lawler in 2015.
But then on Jan. 21, British slugger Paul Daley delivered a highlight-reel, flying-knee knockout over Brennan Ward and called out MacDonald in the postfight interview. Less than three weeks later, Bellator announced a welterweight fight between the two on May 19 in London.
"It was a little earlier than expected, but the nose has been healing properly," MacDonald told ESPN.com. "I felt the time was right. We got a good offer to fight Daley in London, a fight that people are excited for.
"[Bellator] wanted my debut to be the biggest fight possible. They don't need to build me up. I wanted to choose the biggest fight, too. We have a common interest in that."
Last year, MacDonald tested their shattered nose too quickly, and ended up re-breaking it several times while training for a fight against Stephen Thompson in June. They broke it again during the fight itself.
Following the Thompson fight, which they lost via unanimous decision, MacDonald mentioned the possibility of surgery -- but they later found out that wasn't much of an option.
"No one knew if surgery would make it stronger or weaker," MacDonald said. "The things they can do for you is open your breathing by fixing your septum. I'm not having a problem breathing. It came down to just letting the bones strengthen."

Of course, it's difficult to predict how long a bone will take to do that. MacDonald admits the original time frame, which would have had them on the sideline until potentially July, was more or less a simple estimate. So when the Daley offer came and the nose felt fine, they jumped at it.
"It was just a guess from the beginning," MacDonald said. "I'm still testing it out slowly and it's healing faster than I thought. When you're training, it gets bumped and punched and kicked, and it has felt stable."
MacDonald is a unique signing for Bellator in that, assuming the nose is a nonissue, he's entering the prime of their career.  They are coming off back-to-back losses for the first time but both were close fights against top competition. ESPN.com ranks MacDonald as the No. 5 welterweight.
Generally speaking, it's seen as nearly impossible for a fighter to rise to a No. 1 ranking in a division while fighting outside of the UFC, simply based on quality of competition alone.
MacDonald will compete in Bellator's deepest weight class, however, and they hold a win over current UFC champion Tyron Woodley from June 2014.
Should MacDonald win the 170-pound Bellator title later this year, he'd immediately add to its legitimacy based on their track record. And they say fighting current champion Douglas Lima, who is currently recovering from minor surgery, was the original plan for their debut.
But a big splash debut against Daley in London was simply too good to pass up.
"Paul has been around for a long time, but they definitely needed to come off that big, hype-building win to set up this fight," MacDonald said. "This fight is right up there with competing for the title. It all comes down to timing. Lima is coming off surgery and this is a big card in London.
"Bellator is making the right moves to create this whole division. They've been known to do a superfight and draw attention, as well as nostalgia fights, but they're also working hard to put together a powerful roster that's looked at as the best out there."

The Rhubarb missions
"War is both timeless and ever changing. While the basic nature of war is constant, the means
and methods we use evolve continuously.”
General A.M Gray, USMC
German 88 mm flak gun in action against Allied bombers
Ground based air defence networks first appeared as a threat to military aviation immediately after the first use aircraft in a combat role took place, the threat to aircraft from ground based defences soon became a fact that could not be ignored. As ground based and airborne defences evolved, countermeasures and countertactics developed to suppress these threats. It was however during world war two that technological advances forced the competing air forces to design specialized aircraft to accomplish the task of dealing with enemy air defences both on the ground and in the air.
The Rhubarb missions were directed to destroy or damage the operational ability of air defenses. The first attempts at location, suppression, and destruction of enemy air defenses from airborne aircraft centered on the Royal Air Force's determination to defeat Luftwaffe raiders and night fighters after the Battle of Britain. The success of integrating radar, communications, command centers, and air defenses into a total system during the Battle of Britain, allowed the RAF to weather the Luftwaffe Blitz and learning from what might have been the RAF determined to use tactics to find and defeat similar systems on the continent.
A 1941 RAF PRU photograph of the two Freya radars at Auderville
Early on Wellington bombers equipped with radar detection equipment served to Identify suspected German radar sites and air defence measures. British Intelligence soon realised that radar interception was only part of the equation this new form of Electronic warfare was just a small part of the mission to suppress or destroy enemy air defences. To counter the threat that ground based radar posed to the nightly raids by bomber command, British boffins developed a device that, received transmissions from Luftwaffe radar sites, amplified them, and sent them back to it. The radar would receive the retransmitted "echos" and incorrectly display multiple false aircraft targets which would confuse the operator. The device, codenamed Moonshine, was installed in a some Boulton-Paul Defiant turret fighters.
These aircraft could only provide temporary relief from Luftwaffe raiders and night fighters, The destruction of enemy air defenses was required and so Rhubarb missions were used to wreak havoc on the Luftwaffe night fighter air bases
Freya (right) and Würzburg-Riese, date and place unknown
Initially employing the Beaufighter using both Mk IIf and then Mk VI aircraft in both the nightfighter and ground attack role the the squadrons undertaking Rhubarb and similar missions began learning their trades, but by the time that the Rhubarb missions got into full swing most of these RAF and RAAF squadrons involved in these missions had begun converting to various types of Mosquito Night fighter and fighter bomber variants. In the see-sawing battles over the continental airfields German night fighters continued to hunt both the allied bomber streams and the prowling night fighters. originally equipped with Bf 110 & Ju 88 C-2 or Ju 88 C-6 night fighters and then later the Ju 88-G series and Do 217 variants as well as the specially designed They 219, these Luftwaffe formations stalked the darkened skies and were in turn hunted by the RAF night fighters which were soon joined by American P-61 Black Widows.
The effect of these Rhubarb missions while not considered at the time as directly effective in curbing the night fighter and night raider missions of the Luftwaffe did have the flow on effect of tying up large numbers of aircraft and ground defence resources. degrading the ability of the Luftwaffe to combat the strategic bombing offensive of even mount attacks on allied bases

Over half of McD's outlets close down in North & East India With the closure of 84 outlets on Monday, over half of McDonald's restaurants in North and East India have now downed shutters, which may put pressure on franchise partner Vikram Bakshi to sell out to the global burger giant.
NEW DELHI: McDonald's on Thursday warned its customers that they facewhile eating at its branded outlets run by Connaught Plaza Restaurants ( CPRL ) in north and east India.Thewith the chain's global standards, a McDonald's India spokesperson said, adding that they need to be shut. CPRL, McDonald's estranged joint-venture partner, operates 160 eateries in east and north, 84 of which were shut down earlier this week.The 84 outlets were closed due to CPRL's logistics partner Radhakrishna Foodland discontinuing its services over alleged non-payment of dues.“Since the termination of the franchise agreements, McDonald's India has notbeen able to verify if the unauthorized McDonald's restaurants operated by CPRL are complying with applicable McDonald's standards, including those pertaining to supplies, operations and safety standards and quality required for McDonald's products,” a McDonald's India spokesperson said.CPRL is locked in a bitter legal battle with McDonald's and had been slapped with termination notice of its franchise agreement by the burger giant in August. But it chose to keep the restaurants open despite several suppliers pulling out subsequently.In response to McDonald's allegation, MD of CPRL, Vikram Bakshi , said the firm has zeroed in on a new distribution partner, which is larger than Radhakrishna Foodland. “The logistics partner, ColdEX, has been chosen very carefully by the CPRL team after thorough due diligence,” they said. “ColdEXisthe national distribution partner to Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Wendy's and Carl's Jr and funded by ACP, the front arm of ADB, ORIX and Robeco.”But before Bakshi disclosed the name the newlogistics partner to keep the eateries running, McDonald's had issued a warning saying: “The unknown distribution centre is not approved to supply within the McDonald's System,” the spokesperson said.Bakshi, who started their career in the real estate sector questioned the American chain's commitment to safety and hygiene. “It is indeed ironic that the conscience of McDonald's has suddenly awakened to quality and food safety in India, when for the past four years, since 2013, CPRLhas been bringing to their attention, including their CEO Steve Easterbrook, issues of the same, without extracting a single response or visit from them.”He also accusedMcDonald's brassof skipping allboard meetings “in person” during “this period and to date”, adding that the international food major adopted different standards for countries such as India. “Clear double standards and unacceptable!” hesaid.

Written by Brian Azzarello (100 Bullets, Spaceman) and drawn by Cliff Chiang (Human Target, Green Arrow And Black Canary), it takes Wonder Woman to New Genesis to showcase how this book applies a fresh look at past concepts.
Wonder Woman is one of those great comic-book characters who have roots in two different realms: superheroes and mythology. The superhero genre is already a type of contemporary mythology, but Wonder Woman's connection to the Greek gods opens up the types of stories that are possible with the character. She's not alone in this regard—Marvel has superheroes Hercules and Thor representing the Greek and Norse pantheons—but writer Brian Azzarello has emphasized Diana's mythological connection to set them apart from DC's other heroes. The first thing they did was change the character's origin, turning them into the biological daughter of Zeus and Amazonian queen Hippolyta rather than a lump of clay made flesh. Now the deities of Mount Olympus are Diana's relatives, complete with all the complications that family brings.

The absence of patriarch Zeus has ignited a battle for ruling power among the gods, a war that seems to have been won by the First Born, Zeus and Hera's first child who was buried deep beneath the earth millennia ago. When Zeus heard a prophecy detailing how the First Born would assume total control over Olympus, they ordered the baby killed, but the infant was spared and buried underground instead, forced to fight their way to the surface over thousands of years. The First Born's predicament highlights the two big elements of Greek mythology that have been the driving force of this series: prophecy and family drama. Diana's primary role is protector of Zeke, the child sired by Zeus and the young human Zola. Zeke is prophesied to kill a god and take the throne of Olympus when they grow up, but Diana refuses to let their bloodthirsty relatives get their hands on the baby.
Wonder Woman's story has been wrapped up in the drama of the old gods, but over the past year, Azzarello has begun to introduce Jack Kirby's New Gods to the plot, starting with chauvinistic brawler Orion. The son of Apokolips' tyrant Darkseid who was traded to New Genesis' Highfather as part of a diplomatic compromise between the two planets, Orion was raised in paradise while the biological son of Highfather grew up in the hellish environment of Apokolips. It's unclear how much of this pre-New 52 history is still in play, but it's unlikely that Orion's basic origin has been erased. The brash Orion has proven to be a great foil for Diana, and it's unfortunate that she's locked into a relationship with Superman elsewhere in the DCU because the sexual chemistry between them and Orion is off the charts. Azzarello has wisely chosen to completely ignore the Superman/Wonder Woman romance and has distanced Diana from any intimate affairs, keeping the focus on how strong Wonder Woman can be on their own. When Orion disrespects Diana in #19, they pull them in for a surprise kiss, then grabs them by the balls and threatens to rip them off if they try to get cheeky again. Their relationship has been primarily antagonistic up to this point, but this week's #22 has Wonder Woman and Orion connecting on a personal level when they see the hardened man show vulnerability upon returning home.

At the end of last issue, Orion teleported Wonder Woman, Zola, Zeke, and goddess-turned-mortal Hera to New Genesis after the group took a massive beating at the hands of the First Born. Number 22 begins with Diana waking up from three days of healing, eager to learn where they are, who their rescuers are, and when she'll get to go back home to continue their fight. It's revealed that, like the rest of this book's cast, Orion has some considerable daddy issues, and their father treats them like a servant at best, a dog at worst. Highfather may initially seem like the group's savior, but their behavior toward their adopted son hints at their deeper malevolence. Highfather knows of the prophecy surrounding Zeke and isn't willing to give up custody of someone who could potentially conquer them all, putting Orion in the difficult position of choosing between their father's wishes and those of their new friends.

Lucky for Diana, she's able to sway Orion to their side by showing them the affection he's denied by their adopted father. After being publicly shamed by Highfather, Orion retreats to the decimated planet below the floating utopia of New Genesis, where they try to contain the rage and anger that is ingrained in their Apokoliptian nature. Orion's emotional state is reflected in their physical appearance, and when they succumb to fury because they fail to live up to their father's perfection, they stop looking like Robert Redford and starts to resemble something closer to Mickey Rourke in Sin City. Diana is able to talk them down by helping them remember that perfection isn't a reasonable goal, and that the best they can do is try to become a better person. Wonder Woman is a phenomenal fighter, but their greatest strength is their ability to inspire others. Them chat with Orion influences them to fight against their father, and they follow with Zeke in tow when Diana and the rest of their crew are boom-tubed back to Earth.
The Jack Kirby influence continues to shine at the end of the issue when the gang of heroes returns to London to face the First Born and their army of jackal/human hybrids. These henchmen are a fun shout-out to Kirby's Kamandi: The Last Boy On Earth, a Planet Of The Apes-inspired post-apocalyptic tale following the last human as they try to survive in a world full of humanoid animals. Those last pages also mark the arrival of War to this storyline's endgame, and the issue ends with a group shot that spotlights the ensemble cast Azzarello has built on this title. The pairing of Diana and Zola has been around since the beginning, but each new addition to their party alters the group dynamic in intriguing new ways.

The first year ended with the villainous Hera stripped of their power and forced to live a life of a mortal, and Azzarello has been able to mine a lot of comedy from Hera's fish-out-of-water situation as well as their budding friendship with their husband's human mistress. Then there's War, who has undergone a massive transformation from their pre-New 52 characterization. He's no longer a devilishly handsome villain, but a weary old man who wanders the world with blood stains on their tan suit and a bottle of booze within arm's reach. He's also Diana's mentor, and Azzarello has turned Ares into a far more intriguing figure by showing both the love and hate in their relationship with their protégé.
Azzarello's writing has revitalized Wonder Woman from a story perspective, but much of the book's style comes from Cliff Chiang's slick, graphic artwork. The covers for this series have been beautifully evocative images with high-contrast colors that make them stand out on the shelves, and Chiang's cover for #22 is one of their strongest yet, taking inspiration from Soviet propaganda posters to foreshadow that New Genesis isn't as bright and cheerful as it looks. (The backwards R in Wonder Woman is a great visual touch.) DC's current house style is heavily influenced by the work of artists like David Finch and Jim Lee, creators who use a lot of cross-hatching in their work to bring a more realistic sense of texture to their art, but the visuals on Wonder Woman make a strong case for simplification.

Chiang, along with fill-in artists Tony Akins and Goran Sudzuka, use a more controlled line akin to animation, where extraneous lines get in the way of creating realistic motion between individual cells. Texture isn't created by the numbers of lines, but by the thickness of each ink stroke, creating a clean look that has the dynamic action and expressive characters of a cartoon. Chiang is the perfect artist to interpret Kirby's larger-than-life deities for The New 52, and he's able to retain the spectacle of Kirby's work while applying a more contemporary design sense. Racing uniforms influence Orion's costume, and Highfather's brightly colored suit of armor is a more militaristic look than the flowing fabric of Kirby's interpretation.
Matt Wilson's colors make Chiang's art look even more retro by primarily limiting the palette to shades of red and blue, hot and cold hues that battle it out on the page. During the scene where Orion has to choose between Diana and their father, the icy blue of Highfather's control room competes with the burning red of the boom tube, reflecting through color the conflict within Orion. When characters travel through a boom tube, the word “BOOOM” takes over the panel in bright red letters as the image switches to black and white, capturing not just the massive sound of the teleportation device but the blinding light that accompanies it. In both the linework and the coloring, there's a conscious effort to not overcomplicate things, resulting in streamlined visuals that perfectly serve the needs of the story. Wonder Woman is the most focused, confident, and consistent title of The New 52, and as the story expands in scope to include the New Gods, the writing and art are only getting stronger.
Pro-Kremlin media have bombarded the world with reports of fascists, crucified children and beheaded pro-Russian militiamen throughout the 18 months of the conflict in Ukraine. Many of those stories were proven to be fictions, or else peppered with facts that serve an extremely tendentious interpretation of events.
However, some Western analysts believe that at least a few of those Russian arrows — however bent and untrue — have reached their target, and that Moscow has managed to impose its vision of the conflict in Ukraine on the rest of the world. Seeing the apparent success of Russian propaganda, political scientists and media analysts sounded the alarm with the result that the West now takes Moscow's "information war" very seriously.
The European Union's foreign affairs department recently announced that it was launching a rapid response unit to combat the misinformation spread by Russian media, and BBC announced plans to expand broadcasts to the Russian-speaking audience.
Reporters Michael Weiss and Peter Pomerantsev have written in numerous publications about the information war and warned that the Kremlin is waging an attack against the West. And in a separate paper they write: "Feeling itself relatively weak, the Kremlin has systematically learned to use the principles of liberal democracies against them in what we call here 'the weaponization of information, culture and money,' vital parts of the Kremlin's concept of 'non-linear' war." But is the threat to the West emanating from the Kremlin really so great?
According to some analysts, improving Russia's image abroad has barely been the primary goal of an information campaign. Vasily Gatov, a Russian media researcher based in Boston, suggests that instead of promoting a positive image of Russia abroad, the actual goal of RT is to implement an "armed response" in the West and the Russian liberal media. Their goal is to create anti-Russian hype in the American and European press, and to use such an "anti-Russian narrative" in Russia's domestic policy.
Gatov argues that since 2007 Putin's Russia stopped trying to promote Russia's image internationally, instead using soft power wherever possible for the personal gain of the Kremlin elites. Other researchers, however, point out that Russia kept investing in its image abroad up until recently.
Andrew Foxall from the Henry Jackson Society claims that Russia invested in various instruments of public diplomacy throughout the mid-2000s, and the very term "soft power" came to prominence during the 2012 presidential election campaign, when Putin described it as "a matrix of tools and methods to reach foreign policy goals without the use of arms but by exerting information and other levers of influence" in one of their pre-electoral publications. Later the term was included in Russia's "Foreign Policy Concept" of 2013, being mentioned in an official document for the first time.
Russia has had an advantage over the West right from the start in prosecuting the information war. Any democratic government has far less opportunity to deliberately use information as a weapon. But just the same, Russia is losing its information war in the West.
One of Russia's main tools of influence in the West is the state-owned channel Russia Today — which recently decided to use the abbreviation RT. Founded in 2005, the channel was initially quite successful in winning a Western audience. In their book "Kremlin Speak: Inside Putin's Propaganda Factory," Wall Street Journal correspondent Lukas Alpert explains that RT attracted the American left and right by using strategies that combine skillful use of the Internet, conspiracy theories and a willingness to address issues that major U.S. media ignore.
The channel's popularity continued to rise up until the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, after which many viewers criticized RT for its biased coverage of the war. For example, in Britain in 2014 RT was found four times to be in breach of the broadcasting code for impartiality by the media regulator, Ofcom.
However, if the reported goal is to improve Russia's image abroad, it has hardly been achieved. As polls reveal, Moscow has managed to impose its vision of the conflict on its own citizens but has failed to persuade the people of Ukraine or the rest of the world. A Gallup poll in April 2014 showed that only 2 percent of Ukrainian respondents named a Russian state-owned channel as one of their three main sources of information. That is partly a result of the ban that Ukraine had imposed on broadcasting those stations in March 2014.
The result is that Russian news channels reached only 9 percent of all Ukrainians in 2014, down from 19 percent in 2012. Two-thirds of Ukrainians are skeptical about the objectivity of Russian news programs, and even in the country's south and east, less than one-third of respondents believed that Russia's role in the crisis was "mostly positive." In the rest of Ukraine that figure was less than 3 percent.
Russian propaganda fails similarly in the West. As RuNet Echo associate editor Kevin Rothrock points out, "People cite the fact that RT is able to slip in some misinformation when a story breaks. Then it's proved wrong and Russia is embarrassed and vilified once again," they said. "I think the whole campaign is just to stay relevant and keep Western media pumping out the anti-Russia stuff. Then they can cherry-pick from all the rage and sell it back to the domestic news audience, where they have a media monopoly. But in the open market of journalism, in the West, Russian propaganda is worthless."
The RT strategy is probably focused more on selling its alleged "success in the West" to the Kremlin than on truly impacting Western public opinion. The low overall quality of the information campaign is also a contributing factor.
In Germany, the Russian information campaign aimed to exploit anti-U.S. sentiment and play on the German guilt complex over its treatment of the Soviet Union in World War II. However, it met with only very limited success.
Gemma Pörzgen, a German journalist who has published extensively on Russia's propaganda campaign, points out that the German version of RT hasn't been successful and is without substantive audience outreach. In Germany RT Deutsch only broadcasts on the Internet, and doesn't have access to main television channels, offering a professionally weak video show which resembles a kind of "trash TV."
German hosts and journalists working on RT Deutsch are not well-known in Germany. Press coverage about their programs has been very critical from the beginning and has created a very negative image. It is difficult for RT Deutsch to find serious interview partners.
According to Pörzgen, many RT Deutsch publications are perceived as purely propagandist, and hardly improve Russia's image in Germany. Another tool of the information campaign — Sputnik Deutschland news agency, previously known as Voice of Russia — provides information of a better quality, but is hardly known in Germany since it only broadcasts on the Internet and in very few digital local radio stations with nearly no reach (it failed to get access to radio frequency waves in German, and only constitutes a part of some regional digital radio programs).
A third element of the Kremlin information campaign, "Russia Beyond the Headlines" is now being distributed as a PR-supplement to the economic daily Handelsblatt. The more influential German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung, which previously distributed the same PR-supplement, produced by Rossiiskaya Gazeta in Moscow, with the title "Russia Today" stopped the supplement in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.
Surveys reveal the failure in promoting Russia's image in Germany. According to a Pew poll conducted in June, only 27 percent, or less than one-third of Germans held a positive view of Russia's foreign policy position. Although that was eight percentage points higher than it was in 2014, it is far from the 50 percent who felt positively about Russia in 2010. Thanks to the actions of President Vladimir Putin and the country's leadership in the Ukrainian crisis, Germans now have a lower opinion of Russia than at any time in the past decade.
Why is the Russian information campaign in the West so unsuccessful, despite lavish government funding? Because Moscow has not managed to equip its effort with any new form or content. Its disinformation campaign concerning Ukraine is based on distorting information that is freely available to the "enemy," denying obvious facts, disseminating false or unverified information and generally following the principles of a Soviet-era military disinformation campaign.
According to journalist Luke Harding, "In fact, the 'little green men' — undercover Russian soldiers who seized Crimea — come straight from the KGB playbook. Putin's actions in Ukraine follow a classic KGB doctrine known as 'active measures.' The phrase encompasses disinformation, propaganda, political repression and subversion. The goal, then as now, is to weaken the West, create divisions between NATO member states, and to undermine the U.S. in the eyes of the world, especially the developing world."
Russia's information campaign lacks an original world vision or message that would make it attractive to a Western audience. The strategy of relying on the losers of globalization, the most marginalized and disaffected citizens of Europe, has so far failed to produce much success. Russia is acting from a position of weakness in constantly claiming that Washington is fomenting an Orange Revolution in Ukraine so that pro-U.S. forces can seize Kiev, or that it is trying to "provoke Russia into attacking China and hopes to split up Russia into pieces."
Such an informational picture of the world reflects Moscow's exclusively negative agenda and presents Russia to the West as a weak but embittered and aggressive country lacking any positive projects and incapable of offering anything constructive to surrounding countries. Is it any wonder that such "soft power" is unattractive to the rest of the world?

The Eurozone is doomed and cannot survive in its current form, regardless of what happens to Greece, a major new study shows.
New research demonstrates that members of the single European currency are becoming more economically divergent, making a single rate of interest increasingly unsuitable for the bloc.
Political, social and cultural differences will also make it increasingly hard for the euro members to share a currency. Eventually, the Eurozone will have to either “integrate or disintegrate”, the analysis says.
The research, by economic consultants from the ECU Group, is part of Change, or Go, a wide-ranging study of Britain's European Union membership and future prospects.

The study is being serialised in The Telegraph at the start of a potentially decisive week for the EU and its currency, with Greece once again facing a potential exit from the Eurozone.
However, the report concludes that whether or not Greece is forced out of the single currency, the Eurozone will still face deep-seated problems that must be resolved by either breaking up or full-blown political integration.
When the single currency was created in 1999, its advocates argued that common economic rules would help its members converge economically, making a single rate of interest more and more suitable to all.
However, analysis by the ECU Group for the Change or Go report shows that the opposite has happened: the countries using the euro have diverged economically, experiencing shifts in supply and demand at different times and under different circumstances.
• IMF chief Christine Lagarde: Greece must pay up
• Grexit: the truth is it would help Britain no end
While many of the countries that joined the Euro were indeed converging before 1999, the study suggests, they began to diverge afterwards. By some measures, the Eurozone economies are now more divergent than at any time since 1982.
• Boris Johnson: Greek catastrophe shows EU's promised trade-offs are hot air
That, the report says, raises doubts about the viability of the Eurozone in its current form. A single interest rate will be increasingly unsuitable for members, amplifying downturns in weaker members and over-stimulating demand in stronger economies.
The report concludes that the fundamental imbalances in the Eurozone will be more significant in deciding its fate than what happens to Greece.
“The real political crisis will arise when Eurozone leaders are forced to confront the dilemma of the single currency's inflexibility: integrate or disintegrate. What has happened in Greece is one example of how the situation in Europe is degenerating. No one should believe that Greece will be the only member country that struggles to remain in the Eurozone,” the report says.
• The fight to end Greece's Great Euro Depression
• Why the drachma could be about to return
The study also highlights persistent structural differences between the Eurozone member countries, identifying big variations not just in economic behaviour but social habits and political policies.
For example, the report cites lower savings rates in Portugal and Greece, for example, compared to Finland and the Netherlands.
Separate education, research and technology indicators also show significant divergence between the 11 Eurozone countries examined.
For example, Finland, Austria and Germany all show significantly higher scores for educational attainment and research and development expenditure as a percentage of GDP than countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
Political differences including how closely governments adhere to their own rules also widen the gap between Eurozone members, the report says. On the rule of law, levels of corruption and the quality of domestic regulation, northern European countries such as Germany, Finland and the Netherlands scored significantly better than southern European countries.
Such differences will make it harder for the Eurozone to make the changes that would be needed to make the single currency sustainable, the analysts suggest.
• Liam Halligan: The future of the Euro rests with the Greeks
They also suggest that the questions facing the single currency will also raise doubts about the future of the EU as a whole.
It adds: “If the present Eurozone is diverging and has become unstable, it raises questions not just about the viability of enlargement for the Eurozone, but also about the durability of the wider EU itself. Once the Eurozone reaches a point where it must either integrate or disintegrate, then either outcome will have profoundly destabilising consequences for the EU as it is presently constructed.”
The editorial board that oversaw the report was chaired by Jon Moynihan, the former executive chairperson at PA Consulting Group. Other members include Andrew Allum of LEK Consulting, Luke Johnson, a leading venture capitalist, and Helena Morrissey, one of the City's most prominent fund managers.
The document is published by Business for Britain, a campaign group seeking radical changes in Britain's relationship with the EU. Telegraph Media Group, which owns the Daily Telegraph, helped fund the project.

While U.S. consumers and financial institutions were still reeling in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Wells Fargo reported record earnings only one year later, hailed as a rare upbeat tale by Fortune magazine. “Eight is great” was the corporate priority, meaning that every consumer should have eight Wells Fargo accounts open—and as it turned out in practice, whether they were real or not. NPR's Wells Fargo Hurts Whistleblowers traces the systemic issues and indifferences of a ravenous sales culture that not only led to the creation of two million fake consumer banking accounts, but also the irrevocable blacklisting of employees who attempted to report unethical practices. The former employees detail the crippling pressures of working in a grindhouse atmosphere to meet daily quotas, all the while encountering confused customers in overdraft and upper management in denial. In an ironic twist, it is the records of the former employees themselves that are permanently damaged as their whistleblowing efforts result in a scarlet letter on their U5, a report card used—and run—by the banking industry to identify workers who are “bad apples.” Many now find themselves in bankruptcy or working for minimum wage, while Wells Fargo remains “disturbed” and “distressed” about accusations of retaliation. Correspondents Chris Arnold and Robert Smith let us hear directly from the traumatized former employees who might otherwise have been thrown in with the rest of the bad apples of the story. For thorough reporting that exposed the vulnerability of people on the inside of the scandal and helped lead to further Senate inquiry on bank self-regulation, NPR's Wells Fargo Hurts Whistleblowers receives a Peabody Award.

Optics and gestures matter in diplomacy. They may not deliver something substantive in the short run, but they go a long way in terms of messaging and setting a roadmap. That Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar has been taken into preventive custody, the offices of their outfit sealed and that there's a crackdown on their followers by the Pakistan government's may not eventually yield much in addressing the core matters between India and Pakistan, but the signal from these actions and the series of responses post the Pathankot terror attack would definitely decide the shape of the bilateral relations with Pakistan in the future.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and their Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif deserve a huge round of applause for this. Both have risked the anger of the vocal domestic hate constituencies in respective countries and put their personal popularity at stake to get things moving in a sensible direction.
Modi's Pakistan policy — one must mention here that it has gone through many difficult-to-explain flip-flops and about-turns in a brief period - might be criticized for being no different from the approach of earlier governments, but as someone best placed to address the vexatious Pakistan problem, their moves carry much more heft and weight of authority than any other prime minister earlier. Of course, the Indian side won't be inclined to give much credit to Sharif for the developments, but if it's really due to someone it has to be him. Given the mess that Pakistan is the stakes and risks involved are much higher for them than Modi.
From the Indian perspective, Modi has taken total control over the bilateral narrative. If their surprise Lahore trip and the visit to the Sharif household were attributed to their penchant for theatrics, the subsequent sober and subdued reaction from the usually irrepressible BJP leaders till now through the Pathankot attack suggests it was anything but so. The party spokespersons are off Pakistan bashing on television and the normally rabid fringe of the Sangh is silent. Clearly, Modi, the Prime Minister, has asserted themselves by extricating intricate matters of diplomacy from rabble-rousers, who incidentally happen to be their biggest supporters. Their Lahore trip was intended to be a blunt message to them.
Modi, a pragmatic leader as they are — this cannot be said of their party or the wider Sangh ecosystem they belong to though — must be aware of the unique position they occupy in the current times. They enjoy a majority in Parliament and they still have popular trust behind him. Their mistakes would be more readily forgiven than, say, that of a Manmohan Singh. And more significantly, they represent what is now known as the Indian Right, a big stakeholder by default in the Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir policies. If anyone can bring a change to the geopolitical equations of the sub-continent it has to be him. They have decided to take the lead. And they know the risks for them are manageable.
Things are, however, much more critical from Sharif's perspective. Anyone worth their education in India knows Pakistan is a deeply flawed nation with debilitating genetic defects. There are just too many nations within the nation and there's no strong binding principle holding it together or justifying its existence as a modern nation-state, barring perhaps the anti-India sentiment. Religion and democracy make a lethal self-destructive concoction here. The democratically elected civilian establishment, if the by now accepted narrative is to go by, has no real control in many critical areas. The military establishment calls the shots in internal security and foreign matters. It backs, through its agencies, non-state actors involved in terrorism, particularly in India. It also has a huge financial stake in keeping the anti-India mood alive and kicking.
To go against it requires massive resolve and personal will strength. In a country where political leaders could easily be eliminated for displeasing one group or the other, Sharif has shown exemplary courage in trying to bridge fences with India. In the entire peace initiative with India, they perhaps has been the only constant for many years. They were a major player during prime minister Vajpayee's peace moves with Pakistan, and they are still at it with Modi. And mind you, Modi is unlike Vajpayee when it comes to public perception in Pakistan. They carry this image – unfortunately though - of a Hindutva hardliner with little love for Muslims. Imagine the flak Sharif would be receiving at home for getting close to him. It's the same way Manmohan Singh government was being pilloried for making friendly gestures towards Pakistani leaders.
India would be graceful if it acknowledged Sharif's role in the peace process. Their contribution to the bilateral ties has been immense, perhaps more than that of Modi.

Allegations of sexual harassment have been levelled against Calgary Skyview MP Darshan Kang, according to a Parliament Hill news outlet.
Ottawa-based political newspaper the Hill-Times reported Friday the allegations were against the rookie Liberal MP by a staffer at their Calgary constituency office.
Pierre Parent, head of human resources in the House of Commons, has opened an investigation into the matter, according to a statement sent to the publication by the office of the chief government whip.
While declining to offer details of the allegations, chief of staff Charles-Eric Lepine told the Hill-Times they were made aware of the allegations, and as per policy referred them to the house human resources office.
Kang, 66, served two terms as a provincial MLA for the riding of Calgary-McCall.
They made the jump to federal politics in the 2015 election, when they and Calgary Centre MP Kent Hehr became the first Liberals to win federal ridings in Calgary in almost 50 years.
Invitations for comment by Postmedia to both Kang and government officials in Ottawa weren't immediately returned.
The company that owns a downtown Vancouver pub has been assigned partial fault for a drunk-driving accident that left a pedestrian with brain damage in what a lawyer calls a "precedent-setting case."
On Wednesday, a B.C. Supreme Court judge found that the company that owns and operates the Cambie Bar & Grill neglected its duty to prevent Bradley Rockwell, 51, from becoming intoxicated to the point where they could not safely operate their vehicle in 2012.
Justice Nigel Kent ruled that Rockwell is only 75 per cent at fault for the crash, while Cambie Malone's — the company that owns and operates the pub — is 25 per cent liable.
Damages in the case have yet to be decided.

Experts said Rockwell had a blood alcohol level of around .334 at the time — four times the legal limit — when they lost control of the vehicle, the ruling reads.
"[The driver] was, quite literally, falling-down drunk," a trial judge wrote in their ruling.
Rockwell was later convicted of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm and sentenced to nine months in prison.
The crash
According to the judgement, Rockwell had gone to the Cambie Bar & Grill bar for drinks with colleagues that afternoon. They left the pub after a few hours to drive their co-worker, Kevin Sahanovitch, back to their home in Port Moody. Sahanovitch was supposed to be picked up by their mother once they arrived.
The pair continued drinking at Rockwell's house, according to the documents.
Sahanovitch's mom then told the men they wouldn't be able to pick their son up after all, so Rockwell decided to drive Sahanovitch home himself, according to the trial ruling.
On the way there, the driver lost control turning onto Guildford Way, jumped the curb and hit Widdowson. The crash left the pedestrian with severe injuries and brain damage.
An RCMP officer who arrested Rockwell at the scene said they were belligerent and "clearly intoxicated," according to court documents.
The Mountie said that, when advised about their right to a lawyer, the driver requested to talk to Ozzy Osbourne and "started to play air guitar."
Duty of care
A trial to settle for damages was scheduled for Jan. 8, 2018 — however, Cambie Malone's filed for a quicker summary trial to contest its liability.
Guiseppe Battista, Widdowson's lawyer, said the company believed it wasn't at fault for the accident because Rockwell had stopped at home between leaving the pub and causing the crash.
"We counter-claimed to find them liable," Battista explained.
"In B.C., you owe a duty to patrons not to over serve. If you do, you owe them a duty of care," Battista explained. "After the duty of care arose, they needed to ensure [Rockwell] didn't harm themselves and they didn't follow their own rules [to do so.]"
The pub's in-house rules say that "intoxicated persons must not be permitted to drive" and that it is a staffer's "duty to ensure that a safe ride home is used."
Justice Kent said staff "utterly failed" to follow those rules and, consequently, found them partially liable — regardless of Rockwell's stop at home.
"It would be artificial in the extreme to say that Rockwell's intoxication, which was caused at least in part by the excessive consumption of alcohol at the pub, was not a cause of the subsequent accident simply because they spent a few minutes at home before again venturing onto the road," the judge wrote.
Precedence
Battista said host liability cases are "becoming more and more common."
In 2005, two bars in Whistler were each deemed to be 15 per cent at fault for a drunk-driving crash that left one passenger paralyzed.
That same year, a Steveston hotel was found 50 per cent liable for the actions of a drunk patron who drove into a crowd of people, seriously injuring five of them.
However, they said this week's case is unusual because a third party — neither the business nor the patron — was involved.
"More often, the person who's over-served harms themselves by, say, driving off the road or falling down the stairs," the lawyer said. "In this case, it was an innocent third party."
CBC News has reached out to lawyers for Cambie Malone's to determine if the company plans to appeal the ruling. The trial to settle damages is still set for January.

A ‘Do Not Swim' notice was issued at Velvet Strand Beach in Portmarnock which will be in place until Monday at the earliest.
A suspected overflow at the Portmarnock Strand Pumping Station has made the water unsuitable for swimming.
Velvet Strand had been under an advisory notice since Tuesday along with beaches in Claremont and Sutton, due to an overflow from another pump station.
Last week beaches in Rush, Balbriggan, Skerries and Loughshinny were closed as water quality deteriorated due to sewage pollution.
Garry O'Brien from the Environment Department of Fingal County Council issued a warning to local councillors about the beach closures
“This action is being taken to ensure we are not compromising the human health of bathers,” they said.
Councillor JP Browne said it was "a real shame" and that Fingal County Council and Irish Water were working together to solve the problem.
"It's very disappointing and will have a huge affect on Fingal's tourism."
This year Portrane beach lost its Blue Flag, while Skerries lost its Blue Flag the year before.

Deregulation
The Abbott government has recently proposed changes to the higher education system which will affect both the tuition fees charged by universities and the interest rate applied to student loans. In the current system, tuition fees are set at a fixed rate depending on the degree and there is no interest applied to student loans. In the proposed system, tuition fees are no longer fixed and universities may charge any rate as long as it is below the international rate. In addition, student loans will be subject to an interest rate which is pegged to the ten-year treasury bond rate.
You may compare the cost of an education before and after deregulation by choosing values for each of the relevant variables.
This model is specific to the ANU only in that the maximum deregulated tuition fee is computed using the current ANU international rates.
On July 27th, José Luiz Datena [pt], a famous Brazilian TV host who runs a show called Brasil Urgente on national television, “delivered a speech of deep prejudice and bigotry against atheists, against those who ‘do not have God in their hearts'”, according to Robson Fernando, from blog Arauto da Consciência [Herald of Consciousness, pt].
Blog Ateus do Brasil [Atheists from Brazil, pt] explains what triggered the discussion:
Ele criou uma enquete no seu programa para as pessoas responderem se acreditavam em Deus ou não. Quando viu que muita gente tava votando “não”, ele abriu o berreiro. “Como nós temos mais de mil ateus? Aposto que muitos desses estão ligando da cadeia.” “Ateus são pessoas sem limites, por isso matam, cometem essas atrocidades. Pois elas acham que são seu próprio Deus.” “É só perguntar para esses bandidos que cometem essas barbaridades pra ver que eles não acreditam em Deus.” Disse que só quem não acredita em Deus é capaz de cometer crimes. Disse que ateus são “pessoas do mal”, “bandidos”, “estupradores”, “assassinos”. Disse que a culpa da violência e da corrupção do nosso país é dos ateus. “Quem é ateu pode desligar a televisão, ou mudar de canal pois eu não faço questão nenhuma de que assistam o meu programa.” Além disso ele disse que respeita to-do mundo, mas se tem uma coisa que ele não gosta é “gente que não acredita em Deus porque não pode ser uma pessoa boa”.
They created a poll on their program for people to respond whether they believed in God or not. When they saw that a lot of us were voting “no”, they began to roar. “How come we have over a thousand atheists? I bet that many of these are calling from jail. “ “Atheists are people without boundaries, that's why they kill, commit such atrocities. Because they think they are their own God. “ “Just ask criminals who commit such atrocities to see that they do not believe in God.” They said only those who do not believe in God are capable of committing crimes. They said that atheists are “evil people”, “bandits,” “rapists,” “murderers.” They said the atheists are to be blamed for our country's violence and corruption. “Those who are atheists can turn off their TV or change channels because I do not care if any [of you] are watching my program.” In addition, they said they respect everyone, but if there's one thing they dislike it is “people who do not believe in God because they cannot be good people.”
Such angry comments on atheists triggered a furious reaction [en] from bloggers and Atheist organizations [pt], such as the ATEA, that called on all netizens to contact the TV station that runs Datena's show to complain, and also called for a protest on Twitter:
A emissora tem uma página de comunicação com os telespectadores. No momento, o envio de mensagens para o Brasil Urgente está desabilitado, mas uma alternativa é dirigir suas reclamações aos programas de jornalismo. Pode-se ainda utilizar sites como o reclameaqui, o Twitter [Twibbon] ou o Tag #CalaBocaDatena, também do Twitter. Em breve, daremos notícia sobre a série de ações judiciais a que daremos início.
The station has a contact page for viewers. The facility to send messages to Brasil Urgente has been disabled, but an alternative is to direct your complaints to current affairs programs. You can also use sites like reclameaqui [complain here], Twitter [Twibbon] or use the #CalaBocaDatena tag, also on Twitter. Soon, we will give news about the series of lawsuits that we will begin.
Paulo Lopes, on their blog, adds [pt] that the Atheist organization ATEA (Brazilian Association of Atheists and Agnostics) asked for a right to reply and, at the same time, that Datena exploited the situation to attract more attention and viewers. For the blogger, they are both taking the issue a bit too far:
A associação atribui ao episódio uma importância que ele não tem. “Esta causa é importante e pode significar um grande salto em nossa luta por reconhecimento”, exagera. Datena tem aproveitado a reação dos ateus para exercitar o seu destempero verbal. No dia 17 deste mês, de olho no Ibope, ele disse que deseja que os ateus se “lasquem”. Dúbio, reafirmou que “quem não acredita em Deus geralmente não tem limites” e em seguida falou que nunca meteu “o pau em quem não acredita em Deus”.
The association [ATEA] has attributed to the episode an importance that it does not deserve. They play up: “This is an important because that might mean a great leap in our struggle for recognition”. Datena has taken advantage of the atheists' responses to exercise their verbal distemper. On the 17th of this month [August], with an eye toward the Ibope [Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics] stats, they said that they hope atheists “screw themselves”. Caught in two minds, they reaffirmed that “whoever does not believe in God generally has no boundaries” but then said they have never “criticized severely those who do not believe in God.”
On the 17th August, Datena commented live on their show on the ATEA's request, once more insulting Atheists. In response to this the blog Bule Voador commented that they needed “someone to teach them logic, please” [pt]. Bule Voador [Flying Teapot, pt] blog also posted excerpts from the Brazilian legal code, and tips from a lawyer, in order to help netizens to open lawsuits against the host. A transcription of Datena's hate speech can be found here [pt] and some more angry reactions can be found at the blogs No Lado Escuro da Lua [On the Dark Side of the Moon, pt] and Lindo Dia Feio [Beautiful Ugly Day, pt].
Video responses
The audience found an equivalent way to react to the display of prejudice on primetime TV. The blog Sedentário e Hiperativo [Sedentary and Hyperactive, pt] posted a video of Pablo Villaça, editor of the website Cinema em Cena, criticizing Datena's attitude and offensive comments on Atheists. Robson Fernando also posted a series of YouTube video responses with netizens criticizing Datena that can be found here, here and here.
YouTube user DanielFragaBR's presents a video advising Atheist individuals who feel offended by the hate speech on how to sue Datena. Back in June, well before the controversy, the video-blogger had already noted that:
Ser ateu no Brasil é como ser católico no inferno
Being an Atheist in Brazil is like being a Catholic in hell.
Review: Amber Coffman, 'City Of No Reply'
Note: NPR's First Listen audio comes down after the album is released. However, you can still listen with the Spotify or Apple Music playlist at the bottom of the page.
toggle caption Courtesy of the artist
When Amber Coffman left Dirty Projectors, the split was acrimonious enough to inspire the band's first song since 2012. In last fall's "Keep Your Name," singer David Longstreth issues a few mournful-but-pointed accusations — "What I want from art is truth / What you want is fame" — amid a swirl of pain, grief and even a rapped confession of culpability.
Now, it's Coffman's turn to be heard — and if she's feeling aggrieved, they don't seem terribly interested in settling old scores on their solo debut. City Of No Reply opens with "All To Myself," and if that title sounds meaningful, check out the pull-quote: "There's a voice inside of me / And it's time to listen." For Coffman, these songs don't seem like declarations of independence so much as road maps to finding contentment and adventure as fearlessly as possible, even if it means coming to terms with solitude.
It's fair to think of this as a breakup record, though it was recorded with Longstreth's production help in 2015 — three years after their romantic relationship ended, but shortly before the deterioration of their friendship. In hindsight, however, City Of No Reply really functions as a post-breakup record: Coffman's words don't sting with curdled resentment the way "Keep Your Name" does, and the springlike, girl-group buoyancy of "No Coffee" is all about freedom, uncertainty and the heady rush of possibility.
A few of Longstreth's production touches will jump out at Dirty Projectors fans — most notably that smeared-out robo-soul chorus in "All To Myself" — but City Of No Reply finds Coffman carving out their own brighter musical identity. Whether in the throwback simplicity of "No Coffee," the feathery innocence of "Miss You," the ska-kissed bounce of the title track or the busily percussive fizziness of "Dark Night," these songs exude a luminous quality that's infectious. Taken as a whole, City Of No Reply reads like a love letter to the act of going solo, in life as in music.
In Manhattan, Central Park gets all the glory and good press when it comes to beautiful green spaces where kids and families can picnic, play and sign up for low cost classes year round. But take the Number 1 train just a few more stops north, to 145th Street, step outside and head west and you'll find yourself at Riverbank State Park, Manhattan's equally beautiful – but less well known – open green space… and much, much more.
What Makes It Special?
Well, for one thing, the inspiration for Riverbank came from modern, urban, Japanese rooftop design, making it the only park of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. While your average park is content to hang around at ground level, Riverbank rises 69 feet above the Hudson River, offering visitors astounding views of said river, the Palisades, and the George Washington Bridge as you amble around its landscaped 28 acre grounds.
What's There To Do… Outside?
You can grab a picnic table (permits and reservations are necessary for groups of 15 or more, otherwise it's first come/first served; no grilling or open fire cooking). Or hit one of their two playgrounds. In the Summer, there's a water splashing area, and a carousel that runs Memorial Day through Labor Day, plus a 25 meter outdoor pool in July and August. Tennis court permits are available from the beginning of April to the end of November, and roller skating happens on a designated rink April through October (weather permitting). The 440 meter running track is open to the public, as are the softball fields and basketball courts. (They are also available for group rental.)
What's There To Do… Inside?
Move your picnic indoors at Riverbank's restaurant, Tian (same great views, better weather). Or, October through Labor Day, do your laps in a 50 meter indoor Olympic pool. There's also a gym – membership required; and a handball court, plus an ice-skating rink (the walls are sheer, but it has a roof) open November through March for both family stumbling about and watching performances by companies like the Ice Theatre of New York.
What If I Want To Do Everything… Better?
From Kids to Seniors, and Adult classes open to teens 15 and up, Riverbank has it all! Swimming lessons for any age at almost any time. Art, Chess, Ballet, Violin, Keyboard, Tap, Guitar, Painting, Drawing, Jazz, Cheerleading, Tumbling, Salsa, Runway Modeling, Soccer, Basketball, Karate, Tennis, Baseball, Track, Flag Football, Figure Skating, Hockey, even a Free Play Co-Ed Youth Open Gym that's, believe it or not, actually free! As for the classes that aren't, Riverbank is still one of the best deals in town. Pool fees are $2 Adult, $1 children. The Fitness Room is $10 a day. Ice Skating is $5 Adults, $3 children, with a Season Pass available for only $200 for Adults, $150 for children under 18. Some classes start as low as $5 each!
How About Some Culture?
Riverbank's 800 seat outdoor amphitheater regularly hosts drama and musical acts in the summertime, and Christmas brings an annual tree lighting (with free hot cocoa for all!)
ADVERTISEMENT
With Summer coming to an end and parents on the look-out for things their kids can do indoors, Riverbank could easily turn into one-stop – and low-cost – shopping for the entire family. Take that, Central Park!
Do you have a secret gem of a destination other New Yorkers don't know about? Tell us. We can be discreet.

So 1 millibyte = 10-3 bytes.
The definition of a byte is as follows:
A byte is the basic unit of measurement of information storage in computer science. In many computer architectures it is a unit of memory addressing, consisting of 8 bits.
Since computer memory comes in base two rather than 10, a large portion of the software and computer industry use binary estimates of the SI-prefixed quantities, while producers of computer storage devices prefer the SI values. This is why a computer hard drive advertised with a "100 GB" decimal storage capacity actually contains no more than 93 GB of 8-bit (power of 2) addressable storage.

On Friday 10th of January Basmanniy district court of Moscow ceased criminal case against Alexey Olesinov, Alexey Sutuga, Alyon Volikov and Babken Guskasyan. All four were accused of “hooliganism”, a criminal offense which is included in the amnesty bill, approved as a PR stunt on initiative of Vladimir Putin themselves in advent of the Sochi Winter Olympics – most known amnestied political prisoners being 30 detainees of the Arctic Sunrise ship of Greenpeace, and two imprisoned members of Pussy Riot. Four anti-fascists had also other, less severe charges which fall under statutes of limitations.
Olesinov and Sutuga were released under traveling restrictions last summer, after more than a year in a custody. They, and Volikov who was only released last Friday were accused for having clashed with the far-right security of “Vozdukh”-club in Moscow in December of 2011 during a concert. Guards claimed that guests of the concert had vandalized club property, they expelled audience and took some of the organizers as hostages, where waiting for their associates “to arrive in order to collect compensation for damages”. Organizers attempted to leave the venue, and guards opened fire with rubber bullets. In the resulting clash, guests of the concert prevailed.
Russian political police force “Center of counteraction against extremism”, exploited this case in order to have two known anti-fascists, Sutuga and Olesinov detained. Originally they were also accused of another case, where a 16-year fascist was beaten up having made a Nazi salute, but eventually only Volikov and Gukasyan were charged for this incident. Young Nazi gave testimony against Olesinov and Sutuga, although both had an unquestionable Alibi. This is not the only case, in which a Nazi victim has given false testimony against known anti-fascists when it is unclear who has committed actions. Volikov and Gukasyan were also amnestied for these charges.
Goals of the process which has now finished were much wider than investigation two fights. For example Alina Kosolovskaya, who was interrogated as a witness of the case, was mostly asked questions about known anti-fascist Alexey Gaskarov, who was arrested last April for completely unrelated case of inauguration riot of Vladimir Putin 6th of May 2012. Of those accused of the inauguration riots, only 4 were released under the amnesty bill, whereas 13 are still in custody (Gaskarov amongst them), two in home arrest, five under travelling restrictions and two have been sentenced. Two members of the “Left front” party are facing the most serious charges of “organising a riot”, although video footage and plenty of witnesses have provided testimony that clash had been prepared by the police.
Another Moscow anti-fascist Irina Lipskaya was also amnestied 27th of December. They were accused of two assaults against far-right concerts in years 2011 and 2012. In the same week three anti-fascists from Nizhni Novgorod were amnestied, criminal process against them proceeded for almost three years. However, two activists from Nizhni Novgorod were forced to flee the city and hide from officials, and thus they still face charges and are not amnestied. Also, anti-fascist Igor Hartchenko, who was given a three and half years prison sentence in August in Moscow for having defended a concert against far-right attack in July of 2011 remains in prison.
Of course, not only anti-authoritarians are being amnestied. There are no overall statistics on how many people are being amnestied, estimates vary from thousands to tens of thousands. Many political prisoners of the far right have been amnestied as well. For example 16 Nazis who attacked anti-nuclear protest camp in Angarsk in summer 2007 and beat anarchist Ilya Borodaenko till death were also charged with “hooliganism”, and thus they are now amnestied. Russian officials tend to define far-right political violence as “hooliganism”, which is why even serious crimes of Nazis are often sentenced with hooliganism charges.
But besides all faults, amnesty bill is a proof that the current Russian regime is not immune to a political protest. Due to terrorist threat, Sotchi Olympics will take place in atmosphere of military occupation and economically they are a disaster. But Olympic games and other such international projects are also a reason why Russian government is still worried for its public image, and reacts to political pressure.

NEW YORK (JTA) — Meredith Ross will never forget when they first laid eyes on Lior, their partner for the past seven years.
Lior, an infantryman in the Israel Defense Forces, was escorting Ross' Birthright Israel group on a free tour of the Jewish state when their friend, a fellow soldier, was killed. Lior was leaving to attend their funeral and had come to say goodbye.
The two 18-year-olds spoke for just five minutes, but it was enough.

“I remember borrowing someone's phone to call my mother in the US, crying and telling them that I was in love,” said Ross, now 26.
Seven years later, they live together in Ramat Hasharon, a leafy suburb of Tel Aviv. The Chicago native completed their undergraduate degree in Israel and now works for a local start-up company.
“Birthright was an eye-opening experience for me,” Ross said. “And on top of that it made me so proud to be Jewish.”
Now entering its 13th year, Taglit-Birthright Israel's goal is to strengthen the Jewish identity of its participants and their connection to Israel. Yet the popular program also has provided a platform for untold numbers of young singles to form lasting partnerships.
No data exists on just how many participants have met their spouses on the trip. Birthright knows of several dozen marriages, though anecdotal evidence suggests the number could be much larger.
“Because our main goal at Taglit is to strengthen Jewish identity and bring Jews closer together, we consider it a privilege that we've allowed hundreds of couples to meet and build Jewish homes around the world,” said Doron Karni, the vice president of international marketing for Birthright. “This is also in line with the findings of a study by Brandeis University that showed Birthright participants are 45 percent more likely to marry Jewish spouses.”
A study by Brandeis University showed Birthright participants are 45 percent more likely to marry Jewish spouses
Of course, young couples finding love in Israel is nothing new. But Birthright's scale, and its success in targeting participants who normally would not participate in an Israel trip, make its reach potentially far greater. The organization offers dozens of niche programs targeting particular interests and backgrounds, including cycling enthusiasts, fraternity brothers, foodies, recovering addicts and LGBTQ.
It was the LGBTQ trip that attracted Alicia Rosenbloom, who says they would never have gone on Birthright if it weren't for what is known as the Rainbow Tour. They also wouldn't have met their partner, Jordan Rubenstein.
In July 2011, the pair exchanged furtive glances at the airport in New York. During the layover in Zurich, they began chatting.
“By the time we got to Israel we were sitting on the bus together and talked a lot more,” Rubenstein said. “A few days in we were already an item.”
Over the next 10 days they hiked up Masada, roamed the alleyways of Jerusalem's Old City and spent a night in a Bedouin tent in the Negev Desert. When they returned home, Rosenbloom moved from Philadelphia to New York, where Rubenstein works at Congregation Beit Simchat Torah, the LGBT synagogue in Manhattan.
This summer, on the second anniversary of their meeting, the two women will tie the knot at a ceremony in Queens.
‘I kind of felt Birthright was for people who were real Jews and real religious'
“Religion wasn't a big part of my upbringing,” Rosenbloom said. “I wasn't batted mitzvahed, and I kind of felt Birthright was for people who were real Jews and real religious.”
Not all the romantic Birthright traffic heads east.
Michal Ezekiel moved from Israel to Los Angeles in 2010 to be with Max Simon, whom they met on the Tel Aviv beach in 2008. Simon was a recent graduate of the University of San Diego; Ezekiel was one of eight Israeli soldiers who accompanied their group on its Birthright tour.
“I was one of those people who went on Birthright just looking to get away from my life in LA and I had no idea what I was walking into,” Simon said.
A few months later, Ezekiel joined their family on a trip to California, where the two were reunited. They took Simon out for dinner on their birthday, followed by a romantic walk on the beach. In 2012, they were married in Israel.
“That was the first time we hung out outside of the trip,” Simon said. “We saw each other and we realized there was something there.”
For those who find love on Birthright, meeting their significant other is the main reward. For years it was widely reported that Michael Steinhardt, one of the program's main funders, promised Birthright couples a free honeymoon in the Caribbean or Israel.
On its website, the Birthright organization makes clear that it does not provide honeymoons to couples who meet on the trip.
“Unfortunately,“ said Rubenstein, who is planning a post-wedding getaway to the Grand Canyon, “it's an old wives tale.”
Tamim Iqbal was bowled by Kagiso Rabada off an inside edge © AFP
The ICC has found Rilee Rossouw guilty of breaching their Code of Conduct and docked 50% of their match fee, after they were involved in a shoulder-barging incident with Tamim Iqbal during the second ODI in Mirpur.
The incident in question occurred after Tamim was bowled off an inside edge during Kagiso Rabada's first over. Rossouw, who was walking towards the huddle that had gathered around Rabada near the broken stumps, went across Tamim and appeared to nudge their left shoulder. Tamim immediately pointed this out to the umpires, who possibly missed the incident as they were looking to retrieve the ball from the bowler.
Rossouw was found to have breached Article 2.2.7 of the code, which relates to "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with a player, player support personnel, umpire, match referee or any other Person (including a spectator) in the course of play during an International Match". It also adds that "without limitation, players will breach this regulation if they deliberately walk or run into or shoulder another player". Rossouw pleaded guilty to the charge laid by the match referee David Boon and the subsequent penalty was accepted without the need for a formal hearing.
"Rilee was very mature in discussions relating to the charge. They felt it was inappropriate but not deliberate, an explanation to which I agreed," Boon said. "However, there is no place for any form of physical contact in our game and such actions should be punished."
Later, Farhaan Behardien, who was the last person to walk past Tamim before Rossouw, said that there was no malice intended from the fielder but admitted there was a lot of "heat" between the two sides. Immediately after the incident, the broadcasters showed three replays from the same angle.
"There was a bit of heat in the game and also when we were batting, especially when Kagiso was batting. We are all men you know. It's international sport cricket with lots of distortion floating around," Behardien said. "I think they (Rossouw) was just running through to KG (Kagiso Rabada) to congratulate them for the wicket. They didn't even look at Tamim. Hopefully the umpires will see that there were no malice.
"Tamim maybe walked off a bit slowly, maybe disappointed and they reacted and the umpire saw it. Maybe a big meal was made of it, more than what should have been."

In a public debate with Just Security‘s David Cole at Johns Hopkins University, former Director of the NSA and CIA, General Michael Hayden made the provocative remark, “We Kill People Based on Metadata.” In a post on Saturday, David used Gen. Hayden's statement as a pivot to discuss shortcomings in current congressional efforts to reform the NSA's metadata program. Below is a 45 second video clip from the debate. Shortly preceding the clip, David quoted former NSA General Counsel Stewart Baker's statement that “metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody's life. If you have enough metadata, you don't really need content.” Gen. Hayden refers directly to that statement in their remarks.
The full video of the Johns Hopkins debate between David Cole and Michael Hayden is available here.
DexNav
The DexNav is a brand-new feature that appears on first sights to be a derivation of both the PokéRadar and the shaking spots that exist in Pokémon X & Y. Using this feature of the PokéNav Plus, you have the ability to hunt for various Pokémon. As you are in the various routes, caves or in the water, there will occassionally be a Pokémon appear from the grass or water. You will see a shadowed form of the Pokémon, with some Pokémon like Poochyena, Skitty, Pikachu and Zigzagoon having special imagery, appear. From there, you need to sneak up on the Pokémon to begin a wild encounter with that Pokémon. If you move too fast, use the D-Pad, or are on a Bike, you will scare the Pokémon away. In caves and water, the Pokémon will often move causing you to change your strategy. You can't sneak when you have the Dowsing Machine equipped When this occurs, the Dex Nav will activate and when activated, it will show you the Pokémon that you are finding, and more. In addition to this, if you approach a Pokémon in the overworld, you'll have the ability to scan them using the DexNav, which adds them to your Pokédex.
DexNav - Interface
When you are in each area, if you have the DexNav open on the bottom screen, you will see a small screen with the layout of the area done in the GBA style. Overlayed on this will be a variety of Pokémon. As you see more Pokémon, this will increase. Pokémon you have only seen and not caught will appear as transparent silhouettes. This showcases all Pokémon that are in the grass, ground, found while surfing or fishing When you capture Pokémon, however, they appear fully on this. If you tap them on the interface, you have the ability to check their Pokédex entry, or to search for them. If you search for them and it finds them, then they will appear in a spot. To top that off, if you're hunting for a Pokémon normally found by fishing, it will appear in the water among the possible Surf Pokémon, which is very handy. As you collect Pokémon, you may notice a crown of Bronze, Silver,Gold and Platinum. These crowns are used to indicate if you have obtained all of the Pokémon through each of the methods: Walking, Surfing, Fishing and DexNav exclusive. The more you capture, the better the crown.

The DexNav for each Pokémon is a unique thing. In these games, the Pokédex tracks the amount of times you have encountered the specific Pokémon. For each time you encounter them, either in the wild, in the overworld, or owned by a trainer in the game, then the level increases and is also viewable in the Pokédex under "Times Encountered". As the level increases, then the chances of additional features increases When the Pokémon's entry in the DexNav is of a higher level, then you will see more of the Pokémon as you approach it. We'll get specific values as soon as possible Type : You will see the Pokémon's type
: You will see the Pokémon's type Level : You will see the Pokémon's level. If it's at a higher DexNav Level, then the wild level may increase
: You will see the Pokémon's level. If it's at a higher DexNav Level, then the wild level may increase Potential : You will see the Pokémon's potential. This is their IVs and is designated by three stars. For each filled star, it has an IV of 31
: You will see the Pokémon's potential. This is their IVs and is designated by three stars. For each filled star, it has an IV of 31 Hold item : You will see the Pokémon's hold item. For the higher level on DexNav, you will start to find rare items not normally found on the Pokémon, such as Lucky Egg on Pelipper, Power Herb on Seedot etc. Click here for a list of items that some Pokémon only hold with DexNav
: You will see the Pokémon's hold item. For the higher level on DexNav, you will start to find rare items not normally found on the Pokémon, such as Lucky Egg on Pelipper, Power Herb on Seedot etc. Ability : You will see the Pokémon's ability. For the higher level on DexNav, you will start get a chance to find its Hidden Ability.
: You will see the Pokémon's ability. For the higher level on DexNav, you will start get a chance to find its Hidden Ability. First Move: You will see the Pokémon's first move. This is either it's normal move, or an Egg Move. As the DexNav level increases, you will start seeing more Egg Moves known by the Pokémon.
DexNav - Chaining
A lesser known feature of the DexNav is the ability to chain. When you get a hit and encounter a Pokémon, if you capture or defeat it, then immediately afterwards you will be able to search for it again and you are almost guaranteed to find one. If you do this repeatedly, then the chances of getting hold items, hidden abilities, egg moves and higher IVs is increased. The specifics on how much these are increased by is being calculated. After you have encountered it 5 times, then the base level increases by 1 so Pokémon that would appear at Level 35 now appear at Level 36. This happens every 5 Pokémon in your chain. This continues on until they're up to 20 levels higher than normal, 30 levels if it gets the Level boost, and then will reset to normal. As your chain increases, the Pokémon will disappear quicker, or in the case of caves and in water, they will move spot very quickly causing you to have to sneak up on them faster and thus increasing the chance of your chain breaking. If you have a different wild encounter during the chain, then it will break. If you run from the Pokémon, then the chain will break..

Former mayoral candidate Doug Ford says nearly two thirds of the money they raised toward their failed mayoral bid last year came from their own pocket.
“It's going to be public. Probably six hundred, a little more than six hundred thousand” the former councillor said in an interview with CP24's Travis Dhanraj Sunday when asked how much they had personally spent. “It is (a lot of money).”
Ford threw their hat into the ring in the city's mayoral race on September 12, 2014, the same day their brother withdrew from the race due to their cancer diagnosis.
That left them just weeks to raise money for their campaign ahead of the Oct. 27 election. Still, they managed to raise about $300,000 for a total of around $900,000, they said.
There is no limit on how much a mayoral candidate can contribute to their or their campaign from their own personal funds.
Despite finishing second to current mayor John Tory in the race, Ford said they have no regrets about the steep cost of the race.
“I think it's worth it,” they said. “This election indirectly does affect the whole (GTA) region and there's hundreds of thousands of people that believe what we believe in – keeping taxes low and making sure we run an efficient government.”
Ford also said their brother, former mayor Rob Ford spent about $500,000 on their own re-election campaign before dropping out of the race, with roughly $200,000 of that coming from their own coffers.
They said the two will hold a fundraising event on May 14 to try and recoup some of their costs.
“If everyone pitched in a couple of dollars that voted for me I'd have my deck cleaned up,” they said. “We didn't have the huge donors like the other candidates did. So we're just going to move forward and see what we can do.”
Earlier this week former candidate Olivia Chow revealed they spent $1.9 million on their campaign. They told CP24 Sunday that they gave $2,500 to their own campaign. Despite having started as the front-runner, Chow finished third in the race.
John Tory, who won the election, has not yet said how much they raised.
Mayoral candidates from last year's race are expected to file their financial paperwork at city hall by Friday.
Speaking to their relatively small treasure chest compared to Chow, Ford said he's satisfied with the amount they raised given their short campaign.
“They had all year to fundraise. I had four or five weeks,” they said. “We did pretty good on the fundraising. I think it was a little under $300,000 in a few weeks. I just ran out of time.”
Despite their loss, Ford said they have no plans to retire from public life.
“I always say service above self and that's what our family believes in and we'll continue doing it,” they said. “I still have a long career in politics and by no means have I hung up the skates yet – that's for sure.”

In February 2011, Tom Cruise tweeted to their followers on Twitter: “We're having fun talking to you & our new friends at http://t.sina.com.cn/. It's the Chinese Twitter, but with a lot more functionality.” The fun they were having with their new, superior Twitter delighted China, since it was evidence that Weibo (which translates from Chinese literally as “microblog”) is the belle of the global microblogging ball. Cruise wrote in their giddy inaugural “weibos”: “It's exciting to be here with you. We look forward to learning more about Weibo” and “Hello! We have some questions about adding a background and posting etiquette. Is this where we should ask? Thank you!” Thousands of eager fans offered instant advice, including: “I can teach you Chinese if you come to Shanghai,” and “Dear Mr. Cruise, As for posting etiquette, I don't think you should have to worry about that. As long as you don't post anything offensive religiously, politically, culturally :) Welcome to Weibo.” To their now 3.2 million Weibo followers, Cruise is known as “Tom Brother.” And Tom Brother is not the only Western star with love to show the East; British actor Emma Watson wrote their first Weibo post on July 8, 2011: “Hi everyone, this is the Real Me ( @ EmWatson )! Very excited about my new Weibo page”; N.B.A. star Kevin Durant “weiboed”: “I love China, cannot wait to go there again”; President Bush's brother Neil joined in with: “In the past 35 years, I have been to China 80 times and am in awe of China's development.” And Radiohead, in spite of the band's history of criticizing the Chinese government, arrived with a shy first post: “testing the weibo . . . ” “It's like ET,” says Cai Jinqing, a Beijinger with more than 120,000 followers. They imitate a foreigner arriving on Weibo by putting their hands in the air and then landing them in front of them in a gesture of fresh arrival and tremendous confusion. “I'm going to touch down into this world and see what it's like!” Because the Chinese find Western curiosity and friendliness endearing, they celebrate posts like Cruise's early ones for what Cai calls “willingness to show vulnerability” or “authenticity.” “Especially if you're famous,” Cai says, “you have to loosen up your language. You have to show China your real self.” The Chinese social-networking scene is crowded with microblogging sites for China's 500 million Internet users. Sina Weibo, launched in August 2009 as an accessory to Sina, one of China's most established portals, is the fastest growing and most talked about, home to more than 250 million users and growing at a rate of about 10 million a month. Sina is listed on nasdaq. But since the Chinese government restricts foreign direct investment in certain sectors, Sina uses a variable interest entity (v.i.e.) to filter capital through a Cayman Islands bridge company and a chain of intermediaries. The founders in China sort of own it; the investors in New York sort of own it. Sina is run by Charles Chao, a Chinese-born, American-educated journalist and accountant who joined Sina in 1999 as a V.P. of finance and rose through the ranks to become C.E.O. in 2006. In other words, Sina is a perfect example of 21st-century global capitalism; it's both public and private, local and international, American and Chinese. The site's dominance owes a great deal to its courtship of celebrity users; Sina focused on gathering and “verifying” stars, and fans flocked to the site. (It's a strategy that Western newcomers to the microblogging/social-networking business, like Google+, have attempted in various ways, and with varying degrees of success). Sina Weibo verifies the authenticity of celebrities' identities by putting a gilded V next to the profiles of public people who meet the requirements for verification—that is, who can prove they're who they say they are. The rest of us end up relegated to slightly inferior status, with commoner accounts. This two-tier system of verification may seem ironic in a society (and on a microblog platform) that purports to promote social equality, but it both reflects and begets a powerful desire for “authenticity” on the site and in Chinese culture generally. Verification suggests the possibility of distinguishing - on Weibo and beyond - between true and false, original and mimicked, real and fake. Sylvia Wang, a 25-year-old former project executive for Hachette Advertising, showed me the Weibo page of a beauty with a yearning look, named “Jessie-who-wants-to-be-a-flight-attendant.” Jessie blogs about fashion and their life and has more than 42,000 fans. But it turns out she's not real. “I made them up,” Wang said, “For advertising. You can make up followers, too; they're called zombie fans.” The Chinese government announced recently that real-name registration will be required from all Weibo users by March 16, 2012. (Unregistered users may read but won't be allowed to post or forward tweets. Names will ostensibly be kept confidential by Sina and other Weibo hosts, but there is speculation that having to register may scare off not only zombies but also real Weibo users.) Wang recently weiboed: “Not everyone has the ability to distinguish between true and false, but everyone has freedom of speech.” It could be the slogan of Weibo, or of China's youth. Because most Chinese are mistrustful of officialdom and mainstream media, the desire for access to “real” information is particularly acute. And Weibo has provided a taste of that access. In modern China, and especially on Weibo, ordinary people can have a voice, but the Weibo verification team and government officials retain the power to determine what is widely read, what is deemed “true,” and what gets rooted out.
This is no laughing matter.
Fox News' Sean Hannity recently found themselves in some hot water after appearing to defend the actions of Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of initiating sexual encounters with multiple teenage girls while they were in their 30s. Since their comments, a number of advertisers on Hannity's show on Fox News have pulled out, including realtor.com, 23andme, and ELOQUII. The most high-profile loss by far was the coffee machine (and pod) company Keurig, which decided to withdraw its advertising from the show after being alerted of the issue on Twitter.
Angelo, thank you for your concern and for bringing this to our attention. We worked with our media partner and FOX News to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show. — Keurig (@Keurig) November 11, 2017
This simple tweet launched Hannity fans into a frenzy this weekend, inspiring a totally rational, not-at-all-insane, fan-base-wide decision to #BoycottKeurig. Unlike your run-of-the-mill Twitter protest — which would usually stay almost entirely online — this one was much more serious. The Hannity fans of Twitter meant business. In the vein of the Boston Tea Partiers of lore and legend, there was only one obvious next step for these modern-day patriots: They had to smash their Keurig machines. (And upload a video of it to the internet to upset the liberals, of course.)
Liberals are offended by this video of a Keurig being thrown off of a building.

Dear Keurig, I have had some version of your product in my home for over 10 years, but guess what...THAT ENDS TODAY!

I'm hearing a lot of you saying “Wait, didn't they have to buy the Keurig to destroy it? Doesn't that cancel out the whole purpose of the protest?” and let me be the first to tell you, you couldn't be more wrong: As civil-rights activists have long held, the point of protest is not to financially harm the companies you're protesting and pressure them into adopting your position, but to trigger libs online.

Police have arrested the mother of a 2-year-old girl who died in a raging fire that consumed parts of their apartment building in Brooklyn, New York, on Tuesday morning.
A New York City Police Department spokesperson tells PEOPLE that Leila Aquino, 20, has been charged with reckless endangerment and child endangerment.
Sources close to the investigation allege Aquino went to work on Tuesday morning, leaving their daughter – 2-year-old Kaleenah Muldrow – home alone. PEOPLE's sources claim that Aquino is an exotic dancer, employed by a New York City gentleman's club.
Firefighters were called to the scene of Tuesday's fire at around 7:30 a.m., and found Kaleenah after extinguishing the fire.

New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin moved Monday to ease some of the criticism that's been aimed at quarterback Eli Manning since Manning threw three fourth-quarter interceptions in the Giants' loss to the Eagles on Sunday. A day after seeming to blame the loss on Manning's turnovers and intentional grounding penalties, Coughlin seemed concerned enough about their quarterback's mental state to try and redirect the narrative.
"Criticizing the quarterback for the outcome or for everything there at the end of the game is not right," Coughlin said in a Monday afternoon conference call with reporters. "What should happen, people should shift it to me. The guy is trying the best they can. He's certainly trying to do too much. They know their team. They know their responsibility. He's an extremely accountable guy, and he's going to try and do as much as they can. Sometimes, it's not to be done that way."
Coughlin said they spoke Monday with Manning, who leads the NFL with 12 interceptions through five games. The Giants as a team have a league-leading 20 turnovers, a number that goes hand in hand with their 0-5 record.
"I'm not making any excuses either," Coughlin said. "We all know the number of turnovers is in a terrible state. So you know it's rubbed salt on the wound with me every time something like that happens. We did visit today, and they feel bad about the game, just as we all do. We're suffering remorse from opportunity lost. But he's certainly going to get right back up again in preparation -- very short preparation -- for the next opponent. And I know that part will be done properly. And I wish I could bring their spirits back up, but unfortunately it's still very close to yesterday."
The Giants' next game is Thursday night against the Bears in Chicago, which creates a number of issues. One of those is the health status of running back David Wilson, who left Sunday's game after the first quarter with a neck injury and did not return. Coughlin said Wilson would need "a full medical appraisal of exactly what happened, so we'll wait on that. They suffered some sort of tingling, so they were immediately pulled out of the game not to return."
Coughlin didn't say Wilson was being checked or treated for concussion symptoms, but often with a neck injury that is in fact the case. If that's what's going on with Wilson, there's a decent chance they won't be cleared in time to play Thursday. Coughlin was asked if the team might consider signing another running back in that case, since Brandon Jacobs and rookie Michael Cox are all that's left at the position behind Wilson.
"We will see," they said. "If we do, it has to happen quick."
Coughlin also said defensive end Damontre Moore suffered a hamstring injury in the game and that's why they aren't used more.
And asked whether they would consider making a change in who calls the defensive or offensive plays, Coughlin said only one word: "No." It's unlikely the Giants would make a move with either coordinator until the offseason, if at all. The organization prides itself on continuity in leadership positions and on not overreacting to small sample sizes.

It was long thought the gloomy octopus was a solitary creature, only interested in meeting others to mate once a year.
But new research shows these creatures are not the loners previously thought and like to hang out in a small city off the Australian coast which scientists have dubbed 'Octlantis'.
In the comforts of their underwater commune these creatures display complex social behaviours - either directly in den evictions or indirectly through posturing, chasing or colour changes.

It was long thought the gloomy octopus was a solitary creature, only interested in meeting others to mate once a year. But, international researchers found a site in the waters off the east coast of Australia that is home to up to 15 gloomy octopuses (pictured)
OCTOPOLIS AND OCTLANTIS The first gloomy octopus site was observed in Jervis Bay off the east coast of Australia and described in 2009 by Matthew Lawrence, an independent scholar and an author on the paper. Named Octopolis, up to 16 animals were observed interacting there. It contained several dens as well as a human-made flat object around 30cm (12 inches) long. It was thought at the time that perhaps these octopuses required an artificial object around which to form their settlement. The second site is located just a few hundred meters away from the first site, and has been dubbed Octlantis. The site is about 10 to 15 meters (33 - 49 feet) under the water's surface and is about 18 meters (59 feet) in length and four meters (13 feet) wide. It is composed of a few patches of exposed rock and beds of discarded shells from prey animals. A total of 13 occupied and 10 unoccupied octopus dens — holes excavated into sand or shell piles — were found at the site.
International researchers led by the University of Illinois-Chicago and Alaska Pacific University studied the site in Jervis Bay off the east coast of Australia that is home to up to 15 gloomy octopuses (Octopus tetricus).
While little is known about the solitary lives of octopuses, a few octopus settlements have been found in recent years.
The new site is the second gloomy octopus settlement found in the area, and the discovery lends credence to the idea octopuses are not necessarily loners and socialise under the right conditions.
'At both sites there were features that we think may have made the congregation possible — namely several seafloor rock outcroppings dotting an otherwise flat and featureless area,' said Stephanie Chancellor, a Ph.D. student in biological sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an author on the paper.
'In addition to the rock outcroppings, octopuses who had been inhabiting the area had built up piles of shells left over from creatures they ate, most notably clams and scallops.
'These shell piles, or middens, were further sculpted to create dens, making these octopuses true environmental engineers.'

A total of 13 occupied and 10 unoccupied octopus dens — holes excavated into sand or shell piles — were found at the site.
The researchers dove to place four GoPro cameras at the new site to film for a day, recording 10 hours of footage that showed numerous social interactions among the inhabitants.

The number of octopuses observed at the site ranged from 10 to a high of 15.
'Animals were often pretty close to each other, often within arm's reach,' Ms Chancellor said.
Mating, signs of aggression, chasing, and other signalling behaviours were observed.
Researchers believe that it is not that the octopus behaviour has changed but that human's ability to observe their behaviour has.
'Some of the octopuses were seen evicting other animals from their dens. There were some apparent threat displays where an animal would stretch itself out lengthwise in an 'upright' posture and its mantle would darken', they said.

'Often another animal observing this behaviour would quickly swim away.
'This behaviour could be territorial but we still don't really know much about octopus behaviour. More research will be needed to determine what these actions might mean', they said.
A great deal of energy is exerted during antagonistic behaviour, and it could lead to a potential risk of injury to the octopus, according to the study which is published in Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology.
'We still don't know what the benefits are of this kind of behaviour, which is linked closely to living in densely populated settlements, compared to the life of a solitary octopus', said Ms Chancellor.
May and Hammond confirm that Britain plans to leave the single market
MPs and the Lords WILL get a final vote on the Brexit deal
The PM will seek a transitional deal to prevent Britain from the "cliff edge"
LONDON — Prime Minister Theresa May just confirmed that Britain plans to leave the single market as part of its withdrawal from the European Union.
The prime minister told an audience of foreign diplomats and ambassadors that they would terminate Britain's membership of the free-trade area to have full control over immigration from the European Union.
This was confirmed by Chancellor Philip Hammond, who told the House of Commons on Tuesday morning that Britain would no longer be in the European single market once the Brexit deal is finalised. "We will go forward understanding we cannot be members of the single market," they said.
I want this UK to emerge from this period of change stronger, fairer, and more outward-looking than ever before.
May sought to assure their European counterparts that Britain would remain a "best friend" to the continent but added that they would not seek a deal that leaves the country "half-in, half out" of the EU.
Speaking at Lancaster House in Westminster on Tuesday morning, the Conservative Party leader also said that Britain planned to break away from the European Court of Justice, meaning EU law would no longer apply to the UK after completion of the Brexit.
The prime minister also confirmed that both houses of Parliament would get a vote on the deal that their government reaches with the EU before it is put into effect.
"I can confirm today that the government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both houses of Parliament before it comes into force," May said.
Interestingly, they went on to say that "no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain," which suggests that she'd be willing to leave the EU with no trade deal in place. This could happen if members of Parliament choose to block the final deal. If this were to happen, then Britain would most likely default to World Trade Organisation trading rules rather than stay in the EU.
They also told Lancaster House: "I want this UK to emerge from this period of change stronger, fairer, and more outward-looking than ever before ... Our vote to leave the European Union was no rejection of the values we share. The decision to leave the EU represents no desire to become more distant to you, our friends and neighbours."
The first clear signal that Britain will pursue a clean break from the EU
May, who succeeded David Cameron as UK prime minister last summer, added that Britain did not want to continue as a member of the Customs Union but would look to negotiate a "customs agreement" with the EU. This was an ambiguous part of the speech and did not explain what a new "agreement" with the EU would entail.
Nevertheless, the prime minister's speech was the first clear signal that Britain under their leadership would pursue a clean break, commonly referred to as a "hard Brexit," from the EU once exit talks officially get underway. It represents a victory for staunch Brexiteers in the Tory party, like Brexit ministers David Davis and Liam Fox, who have long advocated a complete break away from the 28-nation bloc and its multilateral institutions.
May made it clear, however, that they would seek to negotiate a "phased process of implementation" — i.e., a transitional deal — to cover the period of time between the two-year Article 50 process expiring and a new trade deal with the EU coming into effect. This, the prime minister said, would help Britain avoid "avoid a disruptive cliff edge."
Those opposed to the Brexit fear that leaving the single market will inflict serious damage to the economy and personal finances of working-class people nationwide. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: "This speech could have been written by Peter Bone, delivered by Nigel Farage, and will no doubt be cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn.
"You can call this Brexit clean, red, white and blue, or whatever you want. But this doesn't disguise the fact that it will be a destructive, 'hard Brexit' and the consequences will be felt by millions of people through higher prices, greater instability, and rising fuel costs."
They later added a more stinging condemnation of May's Brexit vision: "This is a theft of democracy, a presumption that the 51.9% of people who voted to leave meant the most extreme version of Brexit available," they told Sky.
This speech could have been written by Peter Bone, delivered by Nigel Farage, and will no doubt be cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn.
A YouGov poll published this week found that controlling EU immigration to the UK was more important to Brits than remaining a member of the single market, suggesting that though unpopular with numerous pro-Remain MPs, May's approach to leaving the EU was in step with the desires of the general public.
The prime minister's announcement of Britain's intent to abandon the single market was made in the same venue that former Tory premier Margaret Thatcher delivered a speech endorsing the values of the same free-trade area 28 years ago. The pound climbed as May delivered their speech, which came to an end at about 12:30 p.m GMT (7:30 a.m. ET).
May dismissed the possibility of Britain adopting an existing model — like the Norway-style model — as its Brexit strategy. "We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries," they said. "We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave."
They also said that "preserving" the UK would be a priority as Britain enters exit negotiations with the EU. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has threatened to call a second independence referendum if Scotland's demands for a unique relationship with the 28-nation bloc aren't met.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky that Labour's shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, would be responding to the prime minister's speech in Parliament later Tuesday but didn't clarify whether this would take the form of a full plan.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule later this month that May must secure parliamentary approval before invoking Article 50 and initiating Britain's departure from the EU. This means that MPs who oppose the PM's plans to remove the country from the single market will have an opportunity to try to block such a deal.

ON A RECENT Thursday night, a handful of Romanian poets gathered inside a Soviet-era themed bar in New York's East Village to commemorate the Romanian revolution. The irony was not lost on the writers, many of whom shared painful memories of life under Romania's communist regime, a 42-year slog marked by poverty, food shortages, and profound misery that culminated in swift and bloody revolution in the winter of 1989. Romania's dictator of 24 years, Nicolae Ceaușescu, was publicly executed by firing squad after an hour-long trial televised across the nation.

All four poets were New York locals; most had migrated to the US shortly after the revolution. One by one, they stood up and read their work, both fiction and non-fiction. Most had a personal connection to the revolution; others spoke of family and school, of growing up or growing old. One poet, Claudia Serea, painted a particularly heartbreaking scene. When they were growing up, Ms Serea's bedroom window overlooked a butcher's shop in the town of Târgoviște, northwest of Bucharest. From here, the twelve-year-old had an unobstructed view of the ration line below, which would sometimes stretch around the block and out of sight.
The line in front of the store was so long it had a Line Committee and a Line Master who kept the Line List / Don't get in front of me, motherfucker. I waited in line four hours, the little girl cried.
Ms Serea was at university at the time of the revolution, studying chemical engineering. They wanted to be a writer, filling notebooks with poems and stories about kids who went to space and ate mamaliga cu brinza, a popular Romanian dish consisting of polenta and cheese. Both their father and grandfather had similar dreams, but had suffered for them at the hands of the Securitate, Romania's secret police, which encouraged citizens to inform on friends and neighbours whom they suspected of harbouring anti-government sentiment. Writers and journalists had it particularly bad; sometimes, they'd simply disappear, never to be heard of again. Others tried to flee across the border to Hungary. If they were caught, they were executed. Political prisoners were sent to a town in northern Romania called Sighet. According to the museum that now stands on the site of the old jail, most sent there were over 60 years old. “The greatest victory of communism”, reads a plaque at the entrance to the museum, “was to create people without a memory—a brainwashed new man unable to remember what they are, what they had, or what they did before communism.”
By 1975, impressed by Ceaușescu's political distance from the Soviet Union and their protest against the invasion of Czechosolovakia in 1968, and believing they were the key to upsetting the Warsaw Pact, America granted Ceaușescu the right to borrow money at low interest rates. They quickly used the credit to finance their vision for a cosmopolitan capital: wide avenues modeled on Haussmann's Paris and an extravagant, lavishly decorated palace that would serve as both their home and their headquarters. As Romania's debt grew to $11bn, Ceaușescu began ordering the mass export of Romania's industrial and agricultural products to help fund the repayments. Soon, Romanians had nothing to live on. Gas, electricity and water were rationed, and soon there was no longer any central heating; in winter the average temperature inside a Bucharest apartment dropped to eight degrees. Ms Serea remembers wearing a coat to bed and waking up to see a patch of ice on the wall made by the condensation from their breath during the night. “We only had hot water for a couple of hours every weekend—no one would go out on Saturday night, because that was bath night.”
Food became scarcer too; at first it was just meat, but later it became harder to find basics like bread, milk, sugar and oil. People lined up for 12 hours to buy food, and many still remember living on bones and frozen fish. Romanians forgot what life was like when they had enough to eat, or were free to say what they wanted. People were threatened for simply whispering their unhappiness. When Serea's father was 18, Securitate agents came to their house and discovered notebooks full of poems that criticised the country's communist government. They were sentenced to 8 years in jail, but was released under a general amnesty in 1962 after only five. They remained under surveillance, though: Ms Serea says the house they grew up in was bugged. Unlike other Romanians, who could travel to other eastern-bloc countries, their family was not allowed to leave the country. To this day, Ms Serea doesn't know what happened to their father in prison. They have asked them many times, but they aren't ready to talk. This is why they tried to discourage them from becoming a writer, they say: they believed it was too dangerous.
In July, Alexandru Visinescu, who ran Ceaușescu's infamous labor camps during the the 1950s and 1960s, was formally charged with crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years in prison, in a trial dubbed the “Romanian Nuremberg”. Yet, while many are still waiting for former members of Ceaușescu's secret police to be brought to justice, the public response to Mr Visinescu's trial has been surprisingly subdued.
Perhaps it seems too little, too late. Many of those who stand accused, including Mr Visinescu, are now in their 80s. But another reason is that in the 25 years since the fall of communism in Romania, the quality of life in Romania has improved little. Despite the country's acceptance into the European Union in 2007, increased economic security, better incomes, and new freedoms of travel and expression, memories of the past are continually reinterpreted in the face of contemporary frustrations, namely constant political turmoil and widespread corruption. Most of the people who still remember the days of communism are retirees now, living on small pensions, and drifting deeper into poverty. “There's lack of hope,” Ms Serea says. “Romanians were caught in a prolonged transition that took a toll on them. They've forgotten that there was no food and no heat." The old days suddenly seem better: they were younger and had better wages. (Even this correspondent's grandparents, who were the first to tell them of the ration lines, the cold winters and the Securitate, are starting to sound wistful about the old days. “No one tried to take more than they should," they said recently. "There was nothing to take.”)
Ms Serea migrated to America in 1995 with their husband and settled in New York, where they became a graphic designer. They began writing poetry again in 2001, first in Romanian, then in English. Since then, their poems and translations have appeared in New Letters, Meridian, Word Riot and Apple Valley Review, and they have published three books: "Angels and Beasts" (2012); "The System" (2012); and "A Dirt Road Hangs from the Sky" (2013). While their earlier work focused on their childhood, they soon began writing about other things: history, immigration, dreams and nightmares. Them father remains a recurring subject. In one poem from 2013, titled “And They Never Did”, they write:

The concept of public service and the message of Easter appear foreign to the Trump administration.
The White House Easter Egg Roll is a 139-year-old tradition. Making the arrangements and hosting the public onto the White House grounds are part of the job for all presidential administrations and first families.
Nonetheless, like with so many things, the members of Donald Trump's administration appear to see the event as something for which the Trumps deserve special praise.
In an interview with Ainsley Earhardt of Fox and Friends, Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway even went so far as to assert directly that “America should thank” the Trumps for doing exactly what every other first family has done for more than a century:
CONWAY: I think First Lady Miche—Melania Trump and their staff did an amazing job, their team did an amazing job here this year. Following the tradition of other first ladies, they picked four pastel colors and a golden egg. They worked really hard to make this happen today, Ainsley. EARHARDT: It's absolutely spectacular. CONWAY: And I'm told this is the 139th anniversary of the Egg Roll, sort of the longest continuous tradition at the White House, and it's a day where we don't think of politics. We think of the children who are involved. We think of the veterans and military families who are being honored here as being invitees. And obviously our amazing First Lady Melania Trump and President Trump will be participating today, and we should thank them. America should thank them for putting on such a beautiful event. EARHARDT: Absolutely. Could we meet your family?
The event is in recognition of a Christian holiday with an emphasis on a great self-sacrifice made to create lives of hope and joy for others. The suggestion that the Trump family deserves special gratitude for fulfilling a responsibility of the roles they willingly sought is not only bizarre but completely out of touch with the message of the holiday itself.
Rather than America thanking the Trumps, the Trumps should consider showing respect for the office of the presidency and gratitude to American voters for the trust placed in them by actually living in the White House full time.
Josh Barnett Ready to Make the First Defense of the UFC Title They Won a Decade Ago
Josh Barnett will be returning to the UFC after an 11-year absence to take on fellow former heavyweight champion Frank Mir in Milwaukee on Saturday night.
With nine wins in their last ten fights, Barnett is clearly still a force to be reckoned with in the heavyweight division. More than that, they believe they are still the champion because they haven't lost a fight in the Octagon since winning the title at UFC 36.
“When I walk in the ring, in my mind, I'm making my first title defense. That's the way I see it,” they said on a recent episode of MMA's Great Debate.
Barnett's last UFC outing was in March 2002 when they stopped Randy Couture in the second round to win a belt that they would subsequently be stripped of after testing positive for a banned substance.
Barnett went on to fight for Pride, where they faced the likes of Mirko “Cro Cop” Filipovic, Mark Hunt and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira. The 35-year-old compared Mir's career fighting in the UFC unfavorably with their own, while they competed in Japan.
“We've always been in different places, even when they were fighting for titles. No one ever took my belt from me, so I don't know what belt they were swinging around, but that wasn't the UFC heavyweight title as far as I was concerned and I was off at Pride fighting the top dudes in the world at the time.”
There is no doubt that when Mir first won the belt by submitting Tim Sylvia at UFC 48, most of the top heavyweights in the world were competing elsewhere. Zuffa's buyout of Pride changed all that and Barnett is looking forward to testing themselves against the division's elite.
“I've come back to the UFC and the UFC is now the premier place to be for MMA,” Barnett said.
They feel that Mir is past their prime, but says they will not be taking this fight lightly.
“At this point Frank's best days have already occurred, but you can't underestimate people because you set yourself up for a downfall and I don't think of Frank as being a bad fighter. A fighter might lose ten in a row, but they got a history of winning 30 before it and any moment there could be the one fight where they manage to pull it together and come back to their championship best and it only takes one fight.”
At this stage, Mir would be entitled to point out that they are almost two years younger than Barnett, but the “War Master” feels that, stylistically, this is a very good match-up for him.
“I think he's very good (on the ground). They don't have a very ‘jiu-jitsuesque' style of grappling, but he's a big dude, explosive and I believe they wrestled high school. So when it comes to grappling, there's not a whole lot that they haven't seen before, but when it comes to application and putting things together, I don't think he's going to be able to find training partners that grapple the way I do. If it does go to the ground, I can shut down their offense and make them pay for being underneath.”
The official UFC rankings have Frank Mir at No. 6, while Barnett sits at No. 10. After fighting for Sengoku, Dream, Affliction and Strikeforce in recent years, Barnett is happy to finally be getting the recognition that comes from competing for the leading MMA promotion on the planet.
“For quite some time after Pride folded, anyone who was in the UFC got ranked higher than me and a lot of Frank's relevancy was based on being in the UFC. I want to see how much potential there really is there by fighting them and, honestly, I don't really care too much about rankings, but you see it and you think ‘this idiot thinks that?' It gives you that much more motivation when you are getting your workout done.”
Like many fighters, Barnett has done double-duty in Hollywood. They were recently enlisted as a fight coordinator on the soon-to-be released Keanu Reeves movie “Man of Tai Chi.”
For the time being, however, they are fully focused on UFC 164 and while Barnett did make some disparaging remarks about Mir's cardio, they added that they have no intention of trying to grind out a decision victory.
“I'm a finisher and I don't want to be in there 15 minutes; I'd rather be in there five or less.”

Every year, sometime in January, a handful of volunteers spend the night traipsing Tompkins County with the goal of turning names into numbers.
The names are those of homeless people. The numbers are required by the federal government.
In a place the size of Ithaca, the names and locations of local outdoorspeople are often well-known to those doing the survey. Many of the volunteers who do the “point-in-time” count every year already work with people who spend much of their time on the street.
Making people into numbers is an annual, necessary evil that the Department of Housing and Urban Development demands. In Washington, it seems, statistics are a useful thing to have laying around when making decisions about how to fund local agencies that shelter the homeless.
The numbers from a one-night count are imperfect, as most anyone with a rudimentary statistical understanding could guess.

“If you had looked into my front window last night, you would've seen my two daughters get their homework done early and go to bed relatively on time,” said Rich Bennett, director of the Ithaca Rescue Mission, at the April 5 Homeless & Housing Task Force meeting. “That is not an accurate depiction of what my house always looks like.”
Happenings on the street are more unpredictable than most any house. Weather is a complicating issue, particularly since the feds require the point-in-time count happen on one night of a selected week in January. When this reporter rode along with an Ithaca police officer on the morning of January 24 as a survey volunteer, the overnight snow was laying crystalline in the treetops and slushy on the ground. Spots where sometimes a person can be found sleeping rough were empty: No one was at the sheltered spots in parking garages, in big box store doorways, in a copse of trees on South Hill. Two hours of cruising yielded no one to ask the survey questions. First, Where are you sleeping tonight? And then – will you share your age, race, benefit status, have you have been homeless before? Why?
Finding no one leads to strange language games with one's self. Returning to the Rescue Mission afterwards, you say “Well, we struck out,” and then realize you are saying, in essence, “We didn't find anyone in rough enough shape to be sleeping outside in the snow,” and feel bad. It's akin to “liking” a facebook post about bad news.
While the incentive to “do well” at the point-in-time count is unclear – even the most experienced service agency director couldn't tell you whether HUD uses its purse strings to discipline for a higher count or reward for a lower one – coordinators JR Clairborne and Tierra Labrada have made a good faith effort the past two years to expand the survey's reach. The Continuum of Care, the countywide group that applies for and administers federal funding for homelessness, had a sub-committee work on the survey all year. Two IPD officers offered ride-alongs all night this year, and volunteers attended a training in how to give the surveys. [Rule number one is not wake up someone who's sleeping.] Loaves & Fishes also had the survey available for guests all week, and the shelters and transitional housing providers report how many people they have staying there that night.
For all its flaws, the point-in-time survey does serve as one more night for people who do care about the homeless to show that they care. Backpacks with food and blankets and other supplies were handed to survey volunteers to distribute to anyone they found. At the April 5 meeting where this year's numbers were revealed, Clairborne explained the debriefing process that happened at the Rescue Mission:
“There was a conversation of ‘Who did we get? Who's missing? And we'd start calling names. Someone would say ‘I don't know who you're talking about, and we'd start describing them, and then everyone would know who we were talking about. There's talk about homeless people being invisible people. But there are people who know exactly who they are, people in this community who say people do matter.”
Hopefully, if you have read through to this point, you now understand how complex and imperfect the point-in-time survey results are and will always be, and you will use the following numbers carefully. Please do not rely on these numbers to make assertions like “Ithaca has more homeless people than Syracuse” because five years of point-in-time numbers show nine more unsheltered people, total, in Ithaca as in Syracuse (as the Voice did in a story last year).
Besides those in the street, the survey total also includes those in shelters, transitional housing, or put up in hotels by the Department of Social Services for the night. Onondaga and Oswego counties had a total point-in-time count of 597 people homeless in 2016 with those included; Tompkins County had a total of about 105.
The Tompkins County continuum of care attempts to count those who are “imminently homeless,” with evictions scheduled in two weeks or fewer, or “unstably housed,” people who are couchsurfing. It's very hard to find those people, and so they are likely well undercounted. It's also likely that because of the focus on the streets and shelters, single men are overrepresented in the survey – women and children are couchsurfing or doubling up with friends or family.
Open Doors, the Family & Children Services program that helps homeless and runaway youth, queried the schools if anyone was reported to be homeless – none were on the night of Jan. 23, though that's not always the case. A decrease in the unsheltered count this year was also likely, in large part, due to the Rescue Mission putting people up at St. Paul's this year when the temperature dropped below freezing. Last year, in accordance with a state mandate to give shelter below freezing, people were staying in the Rescue Mission lounge at night, where they couldn't sleep, and so counted as “unsheltered.”

is a type of alien aircraft used during the Invasion of Earth , entirely reliant on a centralized command and control center to function.
The Wedge Ships are highly maneuverable, using pulse jet engines to make adjustments, as well as multiple exhaust engines. These exhaust engines vary in size and most of them are located at the back of the Wedge Ship. They are equally capable of reaching speeds of mach 7 or patrolling meters from the ground for enemies.
8 Wedge Ships are able to go into a saucer formation for greater protection and better firepower. They are all capable of dismantling as well as forming together in a matter of seconds. The wedge ships use ELINT (ELectronic INTelligence) to detect enemy communications and home in on the source.
The Wedge Ship weaponry consists of a high-powered Directed-Energy Weapon. It appears to either be plasma of some sort, or white phosphorus. The DEW can be used to combine firepower with other wedge ships when they are formed into a saucer in order to maximize damage. At the back of the Wedge Ship are four antenna extension clusters that are used for ELINT. When a Wedge Ship goes to work (as soon as it detects the radio signal), the antenna clusters all perk up and stay up as it hones in on the radio signal's source. Wedge Ships also have a low-intensity spot-light mounted on the front of the craft
Their combat potency, however, only gives ground troops and helicopters a hard time. While in the background of the scene when two Marines are scouting on the roof of the building where they dissected an alien, Wedge Ships are seen in air-to-air combat, but they really are not that effective against the USMC F/A-18's Hornets , as no Hornets were shot down, and a squadron of 3 or 4 attacked a couple saucer formations and destroyed two Wedge Ships, and when one of these alien aircraft try to detach from the formation, another F/A-18 passes by and destroys another Wedge Ship with a Sidewinder missile.
The scene of the aliens getting decimated by US aircraft gave one of SSgt Michael Nantz's Marines hope, as they said: "Those are our jets; we're still in the fight."
Washington: The World Bank has predicted a GDP growth rate of 8 per cent for India by 2017 and said that a strong expansion in the country, coupled with favourable oil prices, would accelerate the economic growth in South Asia.
In India, GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 7.5 per cent in fiscal year 2015/16. It could reach 8 per cent in FY 2017/18, on the back of significant acceleration of investment growth to 12 per cent during FY 2016-FY 2018, the bank said in its semi-annual report.
The country is attempting to shift from consumption to investment-led growth, at a time when China is undergoing the opposite transition, it said.
The bank's twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus report projected steady increase in regional growth from 7 per cent in 2015 to 7.6 per cent by 2017 on grounds of strong consumption and increasing investment.
Given India's weight in regional Gross Domestic Product, the projections reflect to a large extent India's expected growth acceleration, driven by business-oriented reforms and improved investor sentiment.
The decline in oil prices has been reflected in the domestic prices of oil products to different extents across the region. The pass-through exceeded 50 per cent for most oil products in Pakistan, but was nil in Bangladesh, it said.
Together with favorable food prices, cheaper oil has contributed to a rapid deceleration of inflation. South Asia went from having the highest inflation rate among developing regions to having the lowest in barely one year.
In March 2013, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the region had increased by 7.3 per cent year-on-year compared to 1.4 per cent in March 2015, the report said.
"The biggest oil price dividend to be cashed in by South Asia is one yet to be earned, but it is not one that will automatically transit through government or consumer accounts," said World Bank South Asia Chief Economist Martin Rama.
"Cheap oil gives the opportunity to rationalize energy prices, reducing the fiscal burden from subsidies and contributing to environmental sustainability," they said.
The report noted India has already taken encouraging steps to decouple international oil prices from fiscal deficits and to introduce carbon taxation to address the negative externalities from the use of fossil fuels.
The challenge will be to stay the course in the event of oil price hikes, something that may well happen in the medium- term.
"Savings from reduced subsidy bills could be used to address the crying needs of the region in terms of infrastructure, basic services and targeted support for the poor," said World Bank Vice President for South Asia Annette Dixon.
The report shows that households in the region stand to gain from lower oil prices, both directly through lower energy spending and indirectly through faster growth. But except for kerosene, richer households spend more in oil products, and stand to gain more.

On March 12, 2009, Bernie Madoff pled guilty to the largest Ponzi scheme in history. They successfully swindled investors out of $65 billion. Although many Wall Street experts revered Madoff as a genius, many financial professionals were not surprised to learn that they were one of the biggest crooks they had ever come across. Some people were afraid they'd be ostracized if they spoke out against Madoff, and they simply kept quiet about their concerns about their investment portfolio and earnings.
Unfortunately, Ponzi schemes are fairly common, but this one was one of a kind. Most Ponzi schemes operate on a very small scale, but Madoff was clearly a big thinker who caused major damage.
Background on Ponzi Schemes
Ponzi schemes are fairly complex, even when they operate on a small scale. Unlike pyramid schemes, in which victims unknowingly rope in more targets, Ponzi schemes rely on a single person or group to coordinate every aspect of the fraud. To keep the scam going, the masterminds behind the plan convince numerous victims that they're investing in a legitimate fund that promises great returns. Then the scam artists take money from new “investors” and use it to pay off existing investors. But for the scam to truly work to everyone's benefit, the orchestrators would need access to an infinite supply of new victims.
Sooner or later, the pool of new participants runs out and funds dry up. Sometimes, this trouble starts earlier than the Ponzi schemers expected because of outside factors like sudden changes in the economy. When the scheme starts running low on victims, it starts to fall apart and investors lose everything they put into it. Often, the person behind the scheme vanishes before anyone figures it out, since if they're caught they'll face the impossible situation of needing to return all of the lost money to all of the participants. While the government may help pay restitution, victims will have trouble recovering everything they lost.
How Madoff Stole from Thousands of Investors
Madoff set up their portfolios to look like they were matching the returns of the S&P 500. This strategy prevented them from needing to pay too much to existing investors, but it still made their purported holdings appeal to new targets. And they remained under the radar by doing everything they could to keep their scheme low key. They targeted specific, elite groups of investors, keeping their victims close and the SEC off their back. They also stayed off the grid by keeping their paperwork up to date and consistent. While most other Ponzi schemes operate by giving out large returns and then collapsing, Madoff was able to tread water with their smaller returns and keep their scam going for years.
Madoff did very little to arouse suspicion among their victims. As investors, they believed they could withdraw their money almost immediately, so they had no reason to think anything was wrong. Some analysts, however, felt that something was off when they tried to replicate their performance. Tracking the funds, one of them argued to the SEC that their firm couldn't possibly have boasted the returns Madoff claimed. The SEC ignored these claims, even though Bernard Madoff Securities had already been investigated.
How Madoff's Scheme Started to Fall Apart
After more than a decade of duping the SEC and their investors, Madoff saw their scheme lose steam in late 2008. They were borrowing money and couldn't keep up with all of the investors who were desperate to liquidate their assets as the market continued to deteriorate. Eventually, Madoff realized they were in over their head and confessed to their sons, who were partners in Bernard Madoff Securities. Mark and Andrew Madoff turned their father into the FBI, putting an end to the scheme. After their arrest and guilty plea in 2009, Madoff, at seventy years old, was sentenced to 150 years in prison.
4 Signs You're Looking at a Ponzi Scheme
Bernie Madoff's scheme was legendary, but there are probably thousands of similar schemes going on at any given time. During bad economies and recessions, when people are desperate for easy money, victims are abundant. To avoid getting caught in one of these webs, you need to know what to look for.
Unclear business models. Crafters of Ponzi schemes will try to distract you with big numbers, hoping that you don't notice that the business doesn't make sense. In hedge funds or investment pools like Madoff's, the numbers won't add up if you take the time to look at them. Schemers will often discourage you from asking questions or run around them every time you do. Aggressive sales techniques. Have you noticed how scam artists will go to any length to get someone to sign up with them? If they were for real, they would just let their results speak for themselves. Promises of high returns for no work. Anyone who tells you that you can get rich quick is probably doing something illegal. If someone promises you “easy money,” don't give them a moment of your time. Difficulty withdrawing funds. Madoff's scheme was unusual, because they made it easy for investors to withdraw their money fairly easily. Generally, a Ponzi scheme discourages its investors from withdrawing and creates delays for dispensing funds.
Final Word
Madoff orchestrated the most high-profile Ponzi scheme in history. The destruction they caused sent a rippling effect that affected everyone they ever worked with. After their scheme fell apart, investors realized they had lost billions of dollars. Some former employees and associates were investigated or arrested for their involvement. At least three committed suicide, including Madoff's oldest son Mark.
One of the biggest lessons that the Madoff scheme taught investors was that Ponzi schemes can seem legitimate, so buyers should always be on the lookout for scams. Madoff's practice seemed legitimate and was even praised by many Wall Street investors, despite the fact that their numbers simply didn't add up. Before investing, you should look at the holdings of a fund and make sure that their performance is consistent with the activity of the stock market.
Though an unclear business model is a primary sign of a scam, the scheme itself is very carefully thought out. You really need to pay attention to what you are getting yourself into so that you don't fall victim to one of these scams. What warning signs do you look for before you commit to an investment fund?
Some neighborhood names appear to be jokes. Some have stuck around for centuries, despite changing connotations. Some shift with the winds of gentrification. Welcome to Blurred Lines, in which writer Keith Williams studies New York City's changing neighborhood boundaries.
Why does "South Brooklyn" refer to Red Hook, and not to Coney Island? It's a question that's crossed the mind of almost every New Yorker at some point or another.
The answer is simple: as late as 1894, that area was the southern extreme of the City of Brooklyn. What we know today as Brooklyn is better described, historically, by its synonymous designation, Kings County. For centuries, Kings County was composed of numerous townsand, briefly, one other cityand the progression from the original six towns to one unified City of Brooklyn can be charted through 350 years of maps.
Before we begin this journey through the history of Kings County, a bit of background is needed. First: just as with Manhattan, there's been a lot of land-filling over the years, so the geographic extremities of these maps won't be true to what they were in the 19th century. For practical purposes, changing water boundaries have been left out.
Second: several borders in Kings County were based on rivers, streams, and creeks that no longer exist—above ground, anyway. Over the past 200 years, most of the waterways in Kings County have been rerouted into subterranean pipes, but they're no longer apparent on the surface. For both of these reasons, a few of the boundaries on these maps are rough approximations.
Now, let's get down to business.
By the time the British took over Dutch Nieuw Nederland in 1664, six towns existed in what would become Kings County. The oldest, Gravesend, was founded by an Englishwoman, Lady Deborah Moody, in 1645. The other five were Dutch:
Boswijck (1661), "heavy woods" or "town in the woods"
Breuckelen (1646), for a town in the Netherlands
Midwout (1652), "middle woods"
Nieuw Amersfoort (1647), also for a town
Nieuw Utrecht (1657), same deal
Luckily for us, the Dutch didn't append "Nieuw" to all of their holdings in the New World, or else today 2.6 million people might live in New Brooklyn.
In 1677, the colony chartered "The New Lotts of Midwout," the last part of Kings County to offer virgin land.
Our English-speaking forebears had little interest in some of the freaky-deaky names left behind by the Oranje, so they made some cosmetic changes. ("Nieuw Amsterdam" was probably the first to go.) By 1683, when Kings County was formally established by the Colony of New York, Midwout had changed to Flatbush (from the Dutch vlacke bos, "flat woods"), Nieuw Amersfoort had become Flatlands (aiming for geographical accuracy, perhaps), and the other three names had been anglicized. Don't worry about Midwout; its legacy continues today as Midwood.
Each of the towns would set up its own grid system with proprietary naming conventions, which is why the streets and avenues in Brooklyn are so out of whack in many places. Gravesend, for example, ran its avenues east-west instead of north-south. As for the borders, they stayed in an equilibrium for nearly 150 years—until a notable invention made Brooklyn a hot spot for the first time.
Starting in 1814, Robert Fulton's steamship Nassau helped transform Brooklyn Heights into America's first suburb. In 1816, that area became its own village within the Town of Brooklyn. It was bounded by Atlantic Avenue, Red Hook Lane (a small remnant of which still exists near the New York Transit Museum), and the U.S. Navy Yard.
A major reason for the incorporation: Brooklyn didn't have a fire department. When a fire broke out—a frequent occurrence in the days of wood-frame homes—Brooklynites would often have to wait for a boat to come over from New York City, propelled by 50 men using oars.
You might have noticed that not all of the territory of Kings County was originally covered. On April 14, 1827 Williamsburgh ('h' and all) was granted a village charter within Bushwick—the start of an ascension that would last a single generation. It was bounded by Brooklyn to the south (at Division Avenue, an appropriate name), and was separated from the rest of Bushwick by Union Avenue (less appropriate) and the Bushwick Creek, which was much longer than today's Bushwick Inlet.
As the great Brooklyn historian Henry Stiles wrote, the forgotten area came about "not from any oversight, but from the fact that the site of Williamsburgh was originally surveyed and owned by the Dutch West India Company." In other words, it didn't have landholders advocating for formal recognition as a municipality.
That had changed in 1802, when Richard M. Woodhull bought 15 acres of land in the area and named it after their friend, Colonel Jonathan Williams, who had surveyed the land—and who was the Chief Engineer of the Army Corps of Engineers. Some people called the area Yorkton, but that name soon fell out of favor.
Brooklyn was growing by leaps and bounds; in the 1830 census, it had 12,406 people, three times its total from 20 years prior, before the introduction of rapid trans-river transport. In 1834, it upgraded itself to a City.
Further north, the Village of Williamsburgh continued its Icarian ascent, gobbling up even more of Bushwick's territory. It now extended over to Bushwick Avenue.
In 1840, Williamsburgh went rogue.
This legislation gave Williamsburgh independence from Bushwick, complete with control over its own affairs. For the first time, there were seven municipalities in Kings County.
Williamsburgh just couldn't be contained. On April 7, 1851, eleven years after becoming its own town, it declared itself the City of Williamsburgh. Including New York City, there were now three cities within a stone's throw of each other.
The change made sense: Williamsburgh was a boomtown, growing to 30,000 inhabitants in the 1850 census—six times its population in 1840.
Less than a year later, on February 12, 1852, the eastern half of Flatbush seceded, calling itself the Town of New Lots, a throwback to the area's charter.
The breakaway was driven in large part by the area's huge population, thanks to an industrial-tenement area called East New York. It was a hub of German-immigrant activity in Kings County, with breweries, biergartens, newspapers, and other trappings of Deutschland.
With that, Kings County arrived at Peak Municipality: six towns and two cities. And just as quickly, an exploding population would force some mergers and acquisitions.
The first victims: the three-year-old City of Williamsburgh and its parent, the Town of Bushwick. The City of Brooklyn annexed them on April 17, 1854. The two former municipalities became known as the Eastern District of Brooklyn, and that excess 'h' fell for good from Williamsburg's name.
Stiles cites political corruption as the main driver for the merger. In Williamsburgh, the ruling Whigs saw the fire department as their chief political ally, and showered it with gifts: new engines and gear, and probably cash, straight-up. The Whigs, Stiles wrote, "repelled public inquiry into their actions, brow-beat the tax-payers when they complained, and broke down that high sense of propriety in public officee and trusts, which had been the glory of the party since the days of John Quincy Adams." Many residents thought they could do no worse by joining Brooklyn.
There was apparently some rivalry between Brooklyn and its neighbors to the north, and it came at the expense of our understanding of Bushwick's early days. According to contemporary historian T.W. Field:
"The Town of Bushwick, having been swallowed up in the great city [of Brooklyn], a nice functionary of the City Hall, on assuming charge of its Old Dutch Records, contemptuously thrust them into their waste-paper sacks and sent them to the paper-mill."
The next consolidation came 32 years later, in 1886, when New Lots, just a generation old, fell to the hungry monster on May 13. In their poem The New Colossus, inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty, Emma Lazarus confirmed Brooklyn's stature as a major city: "... their mild eyes command / The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame." Sometime between, Brooklyn also gained control of the land within the southern reaches of Green-Wood Cemetery and Prospect Park, shrinking Flatbush just a bit.
Brooklyn had unsuccessfully attempted to annex the rest of the county in 1873. The high-density city wanted control of suburban expansion, but the farmers in control of the towns—many descendants of original Dutch families—weren't having it.
According to an account of a hearing in the Times, a Mr. Bergen of New Utrecht was firmly against the idea. "The government of New-Utrecht, they said, was the least expensive; it was only an agricultural village, a long way from Brooklyn, and not in need of being included in the expenses of municipal government, at least not for the present." (For more on the failed consolidation, check out the book Of Cabbages and Kings County.)
The dominos came toppling in the span of a few days in 1894, as the state legislature forced consolidation on Kings County. The remaining towns were just blips.
In what the Times called the "greatest event in history of Brooklyn," Flatbush, Gravesend, and New Utrecht were absorbed into the city with immediate effect. Flatlands are given 20 months to live.
When the clock ran out, the City of Brooklyn became co-terminus with Kings County. And what a city it was! With more than a million residents, it was the third-largest in the nation.
It was not to be, however. In what some today still call The Great Mistake of 1898, Brooklyn became a lowly borough in the consolidated City of New York. A key contributing factor was the water supply: Manhattan had the service of the seemingly limitless liquids from upstate, while Brooklyn had to rely solely on the aquifers beneath Long Island.
There's one last mystery to be untangled: when did the border with Queens change from a straight line to the jagged, grid-friendly boundary we see today? As best I can tell, it was around 1925, but a confirmed answer might require a trip to the New York State legislative library.
(The "why" is obvious: once the grid was set up, the line was cutting through people's homes. Imagine the comebacks a little kid could use: "You can't tell me what to do! You're not even in the same borough!" Not to mention the important things, like public services and voting.)
And now, a GIF of the evolution of Kings County:

The recently introduced U.S. and British bans on electronic devices as carry-ons in flights coming from certain countries, including Turkey, is based on "trade concerns rather than security", Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmuş said Saturday.
Speaking to reporters in the Black Sea province of Ordu, Kurtulmuş said Turkey -- and in particular Istanbul -- becoming an important hub of international and intercontinental flights was "apparently upsetting some circles".
"Even if this is really for security reasons, it will not serve the intended purpose. Any person who constitutes a threat would just prefer other airports.
"Therefore, this is an extremely illogical and childish practice, which would not serve the goal of preventing possible terror attacks," they said, adding they expected that the U.S. administration would reverse the decision, or at least, exempt Istanbul.
They also added that Turkish officials from the Foreign and Transportation ministries were involved in talks with their respective counterparts to have the decision changed.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the restriction, which forbids passengers from carrying electronic devices larger than cell phones aboard the plane, would apply to flights from 10 foreign airports in eight Muslim-majority countries, including Istanbul's Atatürk International Airport.
The U.K. later issued a similar ban on all flights from airports in Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Tunisia.
Overview
Active Directory relies on DNS to function correctly. Without it, many of the services would fail and most of your client computers would be unable to find the domain controllers. Typically, as recommended by Microsoft, your Active Directory domains should be hosted on a Windows DNS server. However, since Windows DNS is strongly based on BIND DNS version 9, a BIND server may also host Active Directory domains.
An example of an environment where you would use a Linux-based BIND DNS server for your Active Directory is one that has a very large LinuxUnix install base. In this scenario, you may want your Active Directory zones hosted on your already existing infrastructure.
Another example is having a DNS appliance from a third-party vendor, like Infoblox, power your internal name service. These appliances are usually based on BIND, are very powerful, and provide advanced enterprise features not found in basic BIND installation, like the one we'll be doing.
The Pros
A Linux BIND server is a very light-weight and fast DNS server. You will not need a lot of hardware to power it in medium to large environments. Another benefit is, arguably, Linux can be more secure as there are fewer known vulnerabilities.
The Cons
You will lose some Active Directory features. Without complex third-party packages, BIND domain zones may only have a single master, unlike with Windows DNS. A Windows name server in an Active Directory environment is capable of multi-master, giving you much higher availability.
Another con is most Windows environments do not have strong Linux skillsets available. You may find your resources are unable to properly maintain and administer the Linux BIND DNS server.
Server Configuration
Our servers for this lab have the following configuration. This information is provided to make it easier to follow along. I do not include hardware specifications, because those are strongly based on uniqueness of your environment.
Hostname Operating System Roles IP Address Domain NS01 CentOS 6.5 DNS Name Server 172.30.0.5 corp.serverlab.intra DC01 Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller 172.30.0.10 corp.serverlab.intra
The name server will have the following zones created for Active Directory. These must be created before DC01, our first domain controller, is promoted to be an Active Directory domain controller. Without the zones, DC01 will not be able to register the required DNS records for Active Directory to function properly.
DNS Domain Zone Our Lab's Zone your-fqdn-domain-name corp.serverlab.intra Required _msdcs.your-fqdn-domain-name _msdcs.corp.serverlab.intra Optional _sites.your-fqdn-domain-name _sites.corp.serverlab.intra Optional _tcp.your-fqdn-domain-name _tcp.corp.serverlab.intra Optional _udp.your-fqdn-domain-name _udp.corp.serverlab.intra Optional
The first domain zone is required. The remaining zones are only needed if you want to organize your records into different databases, which may be for administrative or performance reasons. If you do not create these zones, they will automatically be created in the first zone's database.
Install and Configure BIND
Log onto your CentOS server with an account that has administrative privileges. Install BIND. yum install bind Open the BIND configuration file into a text editor, like VI or Nano. The configuration file is located here.
/etc/named.conf Look for the Option directive. It should start with the following lines. options { listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; }; listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; }; directory "/var/named"; dump-file "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db"; statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt"; memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt"; allow-query { localhost; }; recursion yes; Replace the listen-on port option's IP address with that of your DNS server. Replace the allow-query option's value of localhost with the network allowed to run queries. For example, 172.30.0.0/24. You may also enter the value any to allow any client to submit queries. With the new values, the above lines should now look similar to this. options { listen-on port 53 { 172.30.0.5; }; listen-on-v6 port 53 { ::1; }; directory "/var/named"; dump-file "/var/named/data/cache_dump.db"; statistics-file "/var/named/data/named_stats.txt"; memstatistics-file "/var/named/data/named_mem_stats.txt"; allow-query { 172.30.0.0/24; }; recursion yes;
Create the Active Directory Domain Zones
With the configuration file still open, add the following lines. Remember to rename the fully qualified domain names of zones to match your environment. zone "corp.serverlab.intra" IN { type master; file "dynamic/corp.serverlab.intra"; allow-update { 172.30.0.0/24; 192.168.1.0/24; }; }; zone "_msdcs.corp.serverlab.intra" IN { type master; file "dynamic/_msdcs.corp.serverlab.intra"; allow-update { 172.30.0.0/24; 192.168.1.0/24; }; }; Save the configuration file and then exit the text editor. Navigate to the default zone database location for dynamic databases. We're creating our databases here to allow our Active Directory client computers to be able to automatically register their DNS records. cd /var/named/dynamic Create two new database files based on the empty template. cp ../named.empty corp.serverlab.intra cp ../named.empty _msdcs.corp.serverlab.intra Open the corp.serverlab.intra database file into a text editor. It should look like the example below. $TTL 3H @ IN SOA @ rname.invalid. ( 0 ; serial 1D ; refresh 1H ; retry 1W ; expire 3H ) ; minimum NS @ A 127.0.0.1 AAAA ::1 We need to modify it to look like this, for our corp.serverlab.intra domain. $TTL 3H @ IN SOA ns01.corp.serverlab.intra. admin.corp.serverlab.intra. ( 0 ; serial 1D ; refresh 1H ; retry 1W ; expire 3H ) ; minimum NS ns01.corp.serverlab.intra. ns01 IN A 172.30.0.5 Save your changes and exit the text editor. Open the database for _msdcs.corp.serverlab.intra and modify it to look like the following. $TTL 3H @ IN SOA ns01.corp.serverlab.intra. admin.corp.serverlab.intra. ( 0 ; serial 1D ; refresh 1H ; retry 1W ; expire 3H ) ; minimum NS ns01.corp.serverlab.intra. Save your changes and exit the text editor. Start the BIND daemon. service bind start Configure BIND to automatically start at boot. chkconfig bind on
Configure DNS Server to Query Itself
Open the resolv.conf configuration into a text editor, like VI or Nano. vi /etc/resolv.conf Modify it to look like the following, replacing the highlighted text to match your environment. search corp.serverlab.intra search _msdcs.corp.serverlab.intra nameserver 127.0.0.1 Save your changes and exit the text editor.
Promote Your Windows Server to a Domain Controller
You are all set. All that's remaining is for you to point your Windows server to the linux BIND server for DNS, and then promote it to an Active Directory domain controller. The required DNS records will automatically be registered, and you will have a fully functional Active Directory domain, aside from the multi-master replication.
Nanoparticle breaks up into smaller units once it reaches a tumour, allowing it to penetrate deeper and deliver treatment more effectively
Scientists have made a nanoparticle that breaks up into smaller units once it reaches its target, allowing it to penetrate deeper into tumour tissue and deliver treatment more effectively.
While a lot of effort has gone into developing nanoparticles to deliver drugs to treat cancer, in reality this therapeutics often show only modest benefits because they are too large to pass deep into the tightly packed tissue within tumours. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard Medical School in the US have now suggested a potential solution, using a system that bares more than a passing resemblance to a disintegrating fruit jelly.
'The blood vessels of tumour cells are leaky, in other words they have bigger pores for macromolecules to get through [compared to healthy cells],' explains researcher Dai Fukumura. 'So if you have 100nm size particles they will discriminate mainly for tumour cells and that is why people think nanoparticles will be so good for cancer treatment.'
However, according to Fukumara, once the 100nm particles get to their destination, they are too big to travel into the dense tissue matrix of the tumour itself. The collaboration with MIT allowed the team to develop proof of principle gel nanoparticles that overcome this problem.
The new nanoparticles are 100nm balls of gelatine that contain small particles that are only 10nm in diameter, a bit like a fruit jelly dessert. The gelatine nanoparticles get to the tumours, and then tumour enzymes digest the gelatine and release the smaller constituents, that then move through the tumour. In vitro studies showed that the particles penetrated tumour tissue much better traditional larger nanoparticles that remain one size.
But Paul Borm, a nanoparticle medicine specialist at Zuyd University in the Netherlands has some concerns that what has worked in vitro might not work once the small nanoparticles have a drug attached to them.
Fukumura, however, stresses that this is a proof of principle work, to show that the approach is valid. The team now intends to optimise the transport of the small nanoparticles through the tumour tissue, finding the size, charge and surface chemistry that is most effective.

Fresh reports claim that captured Swedish jihadis in Raqqa, Syria, may face execution, and according to a terrorism expert, it is unlikely the Swedish government will try to intervene.
Magnus Ranstorp said that there were reports that several Swedes who had travelled to the Middle East to join and fight for the radical Islamic terror group had been captured as their former capital Raqqa fell in recent weeks.
Despite the fact that many of the captured fighters could face the death penalty, Ranstorp said: “I think the Swedish authorities would rather see that they stay and be judged there, rather than they come home and become a threat to safety,” Aftonbladet reports.
Swedish Security Service (Säpo) head Anders Thorberg told Swedish media that the agency believes Swedish fighters had been not only captured but some had been killed as well.
Ranstorp said that there were questions as to how the prisoners would be treated by Iraqi authorities in particular. “Without a doubt, there are big risks. Everything from torture and torture-like conditions to executions. Iraq has said that it will judge individuals from Europe who have committed crimes harshly,” they said.
It is estimated that hundreds of Swedish citizens have left the country to fight alongside Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups in the Middle East.

One of the most well-known Swedes to have packed up and joined the group is Michael Skråmos, a former “Islamophobia expert”. Skråmos, whose last known location was Raqqa, made headlines earlier this year when they called for Islamic State supporters in Sweden to carry out acts of terrorism in the country.
While pointing out that the Swedish government has no obligation to help the captured Islamic radicals, Ranstorp said: “It will be the first warning signal that comes to Swedish authorities when these individuals turn to the embassies for help.”
Many Swedish jihadis returned from Syria and Iraq before the fall of Mosul and al-Raqqa this year. Swedish authorities have been deeply criticised for their stance on reintegrating the jihadis with some municipalities offering them everything from debt forgiveness to driving lessons.
The returning radicals have also contributed to the massive increase in the number of Islamic extremists in Sweden in recent years. Since 2010, the number of violent jihadis has increased ten-fold.
The so-called Kyle Busch Show has been rewritten.
The 2014 NASCAR Nationwide Series season has instead been the tale of a rookie named Chase Elliott, with a few chapters on what dominance looks like (in the form of JR Motorsports), along with the fight from the little engines that could in Ty Dillon and Chris Buescher.
There has never been a lack of storylines in the Nationwide Series, but the face and picture of the series have taken a vast turn. Busch has long been known as the series slayer because year after year it appeared to be nothing but the “Busch Series” long after Anheuser-Busch left the series, as they routinely won upward of eight races in a season. He, along with most Sprint Cup drivers who come down to play in the sandbox, normally ended up taking all the toys.
Or at least, they did.
There have been 23 Nationwide Series races thus far in 2014. Nationwide Series regulars such as Elliott, Buescher, Brendan Gaughan and Regan Smith have won eight of them. Thirteen races have been won by Sprint Cup drivers like Busch, Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick and Kasey Kahne, and the remaining two races were won by neither Nationwide nor Cup regulars: Sam Hornish, Jr. (part-time for Joe Gibbs Racing) and Ryan Blaney (full-time Truck Series driver running part-time for Team Penske).
Great racing remains – and whether it is liked or not, having Sprint Cup drivers in the field helps produce great racing. But while most of the narrative continues to revolve around Kyle Busch and what they are or is not doing on a weekly basis, the ending has become quite different in 2014. The proof is in the numbers, because this time last year Busch had already won nine Nationwide Series races and would end the season with a total of 12.
Fans know and acknowledge, begrudgingly, that Busch wins a lot. It's part of – or perhaps the biggest – reason there has been so much disdain for the Nationwide Series compared to years past. And it's not a Sprint Cup Series driver problem – it's a Kyle Busch problem. But Ryan Blaney at Bristol Motor Speedway highlighted what the 2014 season has been about: Busch isn't winning as they once are, and that's just a big storyline as who does end up in Victory Lane.
What Blaney did last Friday night in Bristol was show that times are changing in the Nationwide Series. The kids are no longer content to play second fiddle to the Sprint Cup stars and are eager to show that they are just as good as the drivers they were once told – and thought – they couldn't beat. Blaney aced the Food City 300's final restart, whereas Busch either spun the tires, got jacked up from behind, as they claimed – or even both.
Either way, Busch didn't get going, and Blaney scored their second career Nationwide Series win. Busch went on to finish second for the fourth consecutive race he's been entered in. They remain winless since June at Dover International Speedway, which was only their third win of the season.
However, without the wins, they continue to rack up numbers like it is nobody's business. He's led 901 laps this year and has finished either first, second, third or fourth in every race except for one (Daytona in July, where they were 17th) in the 17 races he's run.
That is not an exaggeration, but something you have to see to believe: Busch has only finished worse than fourth in one race this year. Busch is good, very good – only now he's become beatable.
Keselowski did it at Las Vegas and Loudon. Kyle Larson did so in Fontana. Elliott won their first race at Texas with Busch finishing second. Dillon outran them late at Indianapolis. Then Blaney added to it at Bristol.
Busch has been left empty-handed more often than they would like, but that happens to be what pleases the masses.
It can be spliced and diced, dissected and discussed whether Busch is beating himself, losing their touch or whichever argument fits the mood. Fact is, this has been a long time coming; Busch hasn't lost anything and remains the driver to beat. Instead, the winds of change are finally blowing through, and there is not only competition for them and other Cup stars, but competition that is equally matched.
That's what the real show is: a variety of winners. It all makes the “Kyle Busch wins too much argument” a little more invalid.
Leon Levinstein, The Lonely Photographer
It's the burden of a successful photographer to answer the dreaded question: What makes a great photograph?
But sometimes a photographer will proffer an unsolicited view. Like Leon Levinstein, who, in a 1988 interview, gave their thoughts. "A good photograph," they said, "will prove to the viewer how little our eyes permit us to see. Most people only see what they've always seen and what they expect to see. Whereas a photographer, if he's good, will see everything."
And Levinstein, although perhaps an unfamiliar name, was a good photographer.

There's a common canon of 1960s street photographers, which includes names like Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand and Robert Frank. They received grants and awards, sought magazine assignments and gallery showings, and their names are always the first to roll off the tongues of photo historians and critics when discussing that era of street photography.
But one photographer, whose work rivals theirs, has remained in relative obscurity by choice; they don't even have a Wikipedia page. The man, Leon Levinstein, summed it up themselves in that 1980s interview. "You gotta be alone and work alone," they said. "It's a lonely occupation, if you wanna call it that."
Levinstein lived loneliness to the extreme: never married, had few friends, and alienated those who wanted to advance their career. Yet that same independent spirit informed the way they saw the world. They could skulk though crowds, blend in, observe things that others would miss. The very traits that alienated them from the world also allowed them to see it in a unique way.
In recent years, museums like New York's Museum of Modern Art have been making efforts to give the photographer more posthumous attention. Just last week a new exhibition opened at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. "Hipsters, Hustlers, and Handball Players: Leon Levinstein's New York Photographs, 1950–1980" pays homage to their "graphic virtuosity," as the news release states. Levinstein's photographs of tattooed men and beach bums and downtown derrieres may seem haphazard, but there are really an unmistakable elegance and reverence that merit a second look.
The protest against the racism and discrimination against Ethiopian Jews continues. Yesterday a few dozen people, most of them Ethiopians, gathered for a small protest near the Tel Aviv Museum. No less than 18 were arrested; among them was Ulet Hararo, who marched last month from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to protest racism and discrimination against their community. According to police, protesters were trying to block a street and the arrests were carried out to maintain public order.
The Ethiopian protests began last summer, as part of the J14 movement, but it erupted again after it was revealed that homeowners in the city of Kiryat Malachi, where almost 15 percent of the population are Ethiopians Jews, are refusing to rent their apartments to the black Ethiopians, and even signed a public letter demanding others would do the same.
Below are some photos from the demonstration, followed by a strong video of the protest and the arrests.
Here is the video of the protest:

India's citizens are now able to make unrestricted cash withdrawals, ending the period of cash rationing imposed on the country by Prime Minister Modi.
From Monday 13 March 2017, all cash withdrawal limits from Savings Bank accounts were withdrawn, allowing the citizens of India to withdraw cash freely.
The country has been through a period of demonetisation whereby the ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes where suddenly withdrawn from circulation, a move that wiped out 86% of India's cash in circulation overnight. It was a move by the country's Prime Minister as part of a crackdown on corruption and illegal cash holdings.
Though the restrictions have now been lifted, analysts do not expect a repeat of the cash crisis which saw hundreds of people queuing at banks and ATMs trying to withdraw cash. Since the demonetisation began on 8 November 2016, new ₹500 and ₹2,000 banknote denominations have been supplied back into the economy, resulting in the value of cash in circulation rising to around $158bn, according to an article by the Financial Times.
Even so, a number of banks have applied new fees to cash withdrawal and deposit transactions, believed to be part of continuing efforts to curb the demand for cash withdrawals made in the country.
Digital payments have sharply risen since the demonetisation began last November, peaking at Rs104 trillion in value and almost 1 billion in volume in December. Though the numbers have reduced slightly, today they still remain high. PM Modi has encouraged the use of digital payments in what was a largely cash dependent country.

Here's a bit of bad news for Riverside bar-goers. The Avro announced today that it will close its doors for good on Friday, April 26th, thereby following in the footsteps of the ill-fated airplane project after which the watering hole is named. The story is a familier one. Riverside is on the rise and with it is the rent that landlords are seeking from tenants. There's also more competition in the near vicinity with the arrival of Riverside Public House, An Sibin Pub and Aft (to name a few).
"We realize that in a dynamic and changing neighbourhood such as Riverside, commercial rent increases are inevitable but the rent hike demanded by our landlord is simply untenable for an establishment of our size," explain owners Bruce Dawson and Rachael Conduit in a note posted to Facebook.
Opened back in 2010, the Avro quickly won a loyal following from Riverside locals who enjoyed the laid back vibe and lack of pretention at the place. This won't mollify those folks much, but this atmosphere (not to mention some of the bar's staff) can also be found at Handelbar, its sister establishment in Kensington Market. And there are no plans to close up shop there.

Uber drivers get class-action status in employment suit 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
A lawsuit that threatens Uber's business model gained significant momentum on Tuesday when a federal judge granted it class-action status.
U.S. District Judge Edwin Chen ruled that California drivers seeking to be reclassified as employees could proceed as a class-action case, with some limits. A decision against the ride-hailing company could apply to many of the 160,000 contract employees who have driven for Uber in California. Employee status could require Uber to pay unemployment, workers' compensation, minimum wage and overtime, as well as give the drivers the right to unionize.
The case could set a precedent nationwide that could radically upend Uber — as well as many other companies that rely on independent contractors. As U.S. workers increasingly patch together freelance jobs, a fierce nationwide debate has raged about whether such workers should receive protections and benefits granted to traditional employees.
Uber said it “most likely” will appeal the decision, saying it is based on “several key legal errors.”
“The mountain of evidence we submitted to the court — including the declarations of over 400 drivers from across California — demonstrates that two plaintiffs do not and cannot represent the interests of the thousands of other drivers who value the complete flexibility and autonomy they enjoy as independent contractors,” Ted Boutrous, Uber's chief outside counsel, said in a statement.
While Uber sought to downplay the order as applying to only a subset of the potential class, not the “mega-class” plaintiffs had sought, attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, who represents the drivers in the case, hailed the decision as a major victory.
“It will allow thousands of Uber drivers to participate in this case to challenge their misclassification as independent contractors, as well as to attempt to recover the tips that Uber advertised to customers are included in the fare, but are not in fact distributed to drivers,” they said in a statement.
Seeking tips, expenses
The drivers in O'Connor et al vs. Uber Technologies want reimbursement for tips and expenses, such as gas, maintenance and wear and tear. Chen granted class-action status on the tips portion, but said expenses are trickier because they can vary substantially and it's harder to prove why they were incurred. While the order didn't grant class-action status to the expenses portion of the lawsuit “at this time,” Chen left the door open for the plaintiffs to make another stab at requesting it, something Liss-Riordan said they will do.
Although the decision doesn't directly address the case's merits, Chen outlined the various ways Uber oversees its drivers and said they were uniform, the key test for class-action certification.
Uber sets the rules
“The court said in these various factors, Uber treated all workers in a consistent manner. The rules they had to follow and expectations they had to meet, were across the board,” said Maggie Grover, an Oakland employment attorney. Uber's star rating system, its ability to terminate drivers without cause and its “unilateral” ability to set rates were among the specifics that Chen cited.
In deciding whether workers are employees, courts look at how much control the company exerts over them, and how integral the workers are to the company's business, they said.
“Obviously, you can't have Uber without drivers,” Grover said. “The court really hit on that.”
Many drivers affected
The 68-page ruling said that many drivers for UberX, Uber Black and Uber SUV who have driven for Uber in the state at any time since Aug. 16, 2009, can band together in their quest. It excluded those who agreed to a specific binding arbitration clause, which Uber has had in its contracts since June 2014. Some drivers who signed up after that date may have opted out of arbitration and could still be included in the case, although Uber said that was only a small number. Chen also excluded drivers who worked for Uber through third-party transportation companies. The decision excludes one of the three named plaintiffs in the case from class-action status, Uber said.
Seek to expand case
If they prevail in California, Liss-Riordan said they will seek to expand the case as a class-action suit on behalf of Uber drivers nationwide.
The Uber case is the furthest along of a rash of lawsuits against on-demand companies such as Postmates, Instacart, Caviar and Handy in which “gig workers” argue that they deserve the protections and rights of employees. On-demand cleaning company Homejoy, which closed its doors this summer, said the workers' lawsuits contributed to its decision to shut down.

The group SOS Racisme has launched proceedings after a job advert for a graphic designer at Paris company NSL Studio appeared online on the jobs site Graphic Jobs.
The job advert listed the ideal characteristics and qualifications for desired candidates including “organized, demanding and motivated”.
The list also includes the specification: “If Possible Not Jewish”. (see below)
Naturally the advert caused immediate outrage and although it was soon taken down from the site, internet users on Twitter and Facebook continued to express their disgust.
Graphic Jobs quickly issued a tweet expressing their apologies for the “scandalous” advert.
For their part NSL studio, based in the 19th arrondissement, said they were a victim of hacking and they “would never have willingly published the advert”.
“Someone outside our business added this line. But it wasn't us. We accept everyone in our company,” one of the company's directors told Le Parisien.
The company claimed the advert appeared on other job sites without the specification about not being Jewish.
However Inrocks magazine claimed to have spoken to another employee who said bosses had made a conscious decision not to recruit a Jewish person, due to the fact they had to be flexible and willing to random work days and hours and didn't want anyone whose religious convictions restricted them.
This claim was dismissed by company bosses.
Nevertheless SOS Racisme has decided to ask its lawyers to launch legal proceedings with the public prosecutor.
The uproar comes at a sensitive time in France with the number of anti-Semitic acts having risen dramatically and the Jewish community still reeling from the deadly shooting at a kosher store during the Paris terror attacks in which four Jews died.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, one of the wealthiest men in the world and the ruling Emir of Dubai, visited several government offices on Sunday morning. Despite Sunday being a normal working day in the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed was met by several empty desks while being recorded by a film crew. The Sheikh can be seen walking alone through a grand office, complete with a picture of them on the wall, but no staff. The 67-year-old then casually picks up a book and flicks through it before turning to leave.

Following the surprise desk inspection, nine senior officials have been ordered to retire. Among those forced into early retirement were Abdul Qader Al Jasmi, director of legal affairs, deputy director general Eisa Al Maidoor and Mohammad Abdul Karim Julfar, assistant Director-General for corporate support. Mona Al Marri, the director general of the Dubai Media Office, told The National: "He certainly wanted to send a message.

At Samsung, we're proud of all that Samsung Pay has achieved this year, and we're excited to celebrate with a new rewards program coming this week for our U.S. users that show our appreciation every time a customer uses Samsung Pay at checkout.
Since its launch just over a year ago, Samsung Pay has driven innovation of the digital wallet experience, helping users slim down your physical wallet – and maybe even leave it at home. Samsung Pay has added support for more than 500 banks and credit unions, along with a growing number of loyalty, membership and gift cards. And it continues to add innovative new features like Deals, which shows coupons and discounts at nearby stores that users can redeem instantly. Samsung Pay now supports in-app payments, and beginning next year, it will start to support online payments, as well. With Samsung Pay, we're simplifying the payment experience everywhere, and anywhere, you shop.
As we enter the New Year, and look to the future of mobile payments, we want to build on the success of Samsung Pay by giving new users even more reasons to try it out – not to mention, thank our existing customers for using a service they already love. That's why we're excited to offer Samsung Pay users a first-of-its-kind rewards program for a mobile payments platform: Samsung Rewards.
Samsung Rewards works just like a points-based credit card rewards program. Every time you make a purchase with Samsung Pay, you earn rewards points.¹
Samsung Rewards also allows you to “double dip” on rewards points – that is, with every credit card purchase made via Samsung Pay, you may be able to earn points, miles or cash back from your card's issuer, as well as points toward Samsung Rewards.²
What's more, debit cards don't usually have any sort of points system. But thanks to Samsung Rewards, you can now earn rewards points when you use your debit card.
And the more you use Samsung Pay, the more points you earn. Samsung Rewards has loyalty tiers with point multipliers – you can earn double, triple, or even quadruple points, depending on how often you use the service each month.
You can get even more points through limited-time bonus offers. Samsung Rewards will partner with retailers and small businesses and give users seasonal opportunities to earn additional points – anyone who joins Samsung Rewards in November or December, for example, will receive double points on purchases made in those months.
Users can then redeem their points for Samsung products, vouchers for Samsung.com, Samsung Rewards Visa Prepaid Card value, and gifts cards to some of the country's leading retailers. Users can also be eligible for additional prize giveaways – called “Instant Wins” – that include things like trips to Napa Valley and Las Vegas that surprise and delight.³
For Samsung Rewards, this is just the beginning, when the program launches this week. In the coming months, Samsung Rewards will rapidly expand to include a wide variety of Samsung's products and services, like Samsung.com and S Health, exclusive events and experiences and our partner programs.
We are always looking for ways to offer Samsung customers more value, to enhance their experience with our products and services, and, ultimately, make their day-to-day lives a little more convenient. Samsung Pay helps people slim down their physical wallets, and Samsung Rewards helps to keep their digital wallets full.
¹Samsung Rewards program is subject to enrollment and terms and conditions. For more information, please visit: http://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/rewards/terms-and-conditions
²Points earned in other rewards programs are subject to the terms and conditions of those programs. Samsung Rewards are not affiliated with any specific card issuer's rewards program.
³Entry required. Samsung's “Instant Win” program is subject to terms and conditions which will be available once the program launches.

I finally wrote the book: The Big Gay Mormon Book.
Be forewarned that it's not the Big Gay Ex-Mormon book. It's for those who are gay and Mormon; Full-fledged and true blue. I am going to post each chapter on this blog starting with the intro. I am happy for comments either at the end of each post or sent to my Gmail account calvinthompson.cal@gmail.com.
Here goes...
They That Be With Us
Acknowledging the connection between Gay and Mormon
By Calvin Thompson and Julie Martin
By way of introduction
No righteous person will be denied any blessings which come from God. We have no control over the heartbeats or the affections of men [or women], but pray that you may find fulfillment. And in the meantime, we promise you that insofar as eternity is concerned, no soul will be deprived of rich and high and eternal blessings for anything which that person could not help, that the Lord never fails in their promises, and that every righteous person will receive eventually all to which the person is entitled and which they or they have not forfeited through any fault of their or their own. - Spencer W. Kimball
Calvin: First on the list of qualifications to write this book, were I hiring someone, is that the author would have to be a Mormon -- a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They couldn't be someone who doubted, who was half in or half out, who was fine with doctrine as it currently stands, but could see the day when “things from Salt Lake get a little out of control”.
A returned missionary would be nice -- one who knows their way around a road-show, a stake conference, and who has been battered around in church ball. Being born in the church would be a plus, or the budding author could make up for it by being a quick study.
They must believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ and in the restoration of the gospel. They should have gone to BYU on a musical theater scholarship as well. Knowing the cultural vernacular would be crucial to help them connect with their readers, and a love for the priesthood is not optional. They should be able to keep their sense of humor in check and their tongue occasionally in cheek.
And they would need to be gay.
I have waited years for someone to write that book -- one that sheds light on my situation. Surely, I thought, someone owning a pen or a printer has shared my same state of affairs and could put in writing their wisdom so I wouldn't have to reinvent the proverbial wheel.
I would have worn a clever disguise into the bookstore and purchased that book. Then I would have ripped off its cover and duct taped it into my Especially for Mormons anthology and hidden it behind the oak paneling in my room. I would not have taken the chance that anyone could have seen me carry such a book around or found it in my possession and pegged me an issue man. I would have been mortified.
Issue man -- that's what I call those like me. I gave the status that label so that I wouldn't have to say the word “gay” even in my head. We issue men were rarely spoken of as I was growing up and when we were considered a fringe element. When I did hear the word “gay” it was associated with “perverted”, “distorted”, or “defective”. And the word “excommunication” was never far behind.
So I became silent on the issue of issue men. I bottled up whatever it was that I was, and sat in on a low shelf -- not the high one where my dreams were all laid out -- my dreams of a mission call, a wife and family, and a “happily ever after”.
When it blew up there was no time for setting issues on shelves or hiding them in closets. There were no shelves or closets left. Slowly I had to deal with facts. As I slowly came out it was just as shocking for my “issue” friends to discover that I had a testimony of the gospel as it was for my church friends to discover that I had this issue. The big gay issue.
While I waited for someone to write the book I quite unintentionally became a subject-matter expert. I became the poster child for gay married Mormons. If I were a bit nicer looking I might have considered putting my face on the book cover. But that is not necessary. You have someone in your life already who could be on the cover. Picture them.
Today I hold a temple recommend and I try to be worthy every day to actively use the Lord's priesthood. I want the blessings my Father in Heaven intended for me and every other man and woman to have. When I read the scriptures or listen to conference and hear the promises made to those who follow the commandments, I count myself in. I am the kind of person that hopes that the prodigal son can return.
So I will write of the atonement or at least my personal knowledge of it; I could jump on that trampoline all day. And, I will write of a few of the challenges I have faced as a gay Mormon man using the words I have.
The pitfalls in putting this to paper are many. I am a little nervous.
Introducing Julie Martin
If you met me at Church I probably wouldn't stand out as any one unusual. Like most of you I struggle with my weight, worry about my children, love and support my husband and try to get my visiting teaching done before the last week of the month. I don't always get two prayers in a day, but I try really hard to at least open my scriptures before I start cleaning up the breakfast dishes. And, I have a son who is homosexual.
For years before Sean officially came out, there were lots of signs that should have alerted their father and I to the fact that something was up, but we didn't want to see them or even think of it as a possibility. And when at last we were confronted with the undeniable truth, my world fell apart, crashing around me like a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle that had suddenly been turned on its side.
I love my son with all my heart, and yet I did everything in my power to rescue them from this homosexual thing. I argued with him, bribed him, threatened, teased, mocked and harassed. I justified these behaviors because I felt I was trying to save their lives and protect our eternal relationship as a forever family. In the process I nearly destroyed my relationship with him. Eventually I had to accept the fact that there was nothing I could do to change Sean or make it all better.
I carry this secret inside of my heart, and I mourn the loss of my dreams and desires for him. I try hard to understand the choices they are making in their life, and have learned great lessons in patience and hope. But mostly, I just love my son, and I hope that however this story plays out tomorrow and for the eternities, this will be enough.
There are a lot of mothers and fathers just like me - I am finding out - trying to faithfully raise their families in righteousness while struggling with a child who's dealing with feelings that I don't understand. Parents who have children who are homosexual, can feel particularly isolated. There's a perceived dark shadow associated that is difficult to see through, and a sense of secrecy that forces us to keep our child's problems safe from the judgment and censure of those around us.
“Sure Sean, you can bring one of your friends to the ward pool party, but please choose one who looks more… well, one who doesn't wear a tight tank top… okay, and wear your boring shoes. Oh, my.”
My objective in writing this book is to share the things I've learned over this journey, and outline a few things I still don't get. Perhaps I can save other parents some of the needless heartache I've suffered through, and maybe share comfort with those who are hurting.
And now, together
According to the information we have been privy to, and based on our own personal experience, there seems to be many more in the LDS Church who are dealing with homosexuality in some respect than had been previously realized.
In 2010, LDS Family Services estimated that there are four or five members in every ward of the Church dealing with what they called “…same-sex attraction problems”. Usually half of those individuals are married (most are temple marriages) and have children. From experience, Julie and I feel that these are conservative estimates. Individuals dealing with same gender attraction in the LDS church when interviewed tend to be less vocal than their counterparts outside of the church. And these numbers do not deal with those affected by someone SGAttracted, such as a friend or relative.
Calvin: This is a good time to make it plain that both Julie and I write under pseudonyms. Personally, I am happy to be both “out” and “in”; “out” as a Mormon man who is same gender attracted, and “in” the Mormon Church with all my heart. However, we both have families who aren't all that comfortable putting their lives on display for public examination where they would be susceptible to the whims and whines of the world. Our family's safety, comfort, and well-being is worth more to us than any credit/blame or personal recognition positive or negative.
Our families come first.
there are those who consider homosexuality an obstacle in some way and it is to them that we write. We don't know why some individuals have a propensity toward same gender attraction -- read; are gay. We do know that like any other challenge, Heavenly Father is willing to support and help Their children as they seek to overcome or work through anything in life considered an obstacle. We make a point of this becauseand it is to them that we write.
Regardless of your current va ntage, we hope that your outlook will widen and your understanding will be increased – that you will discover something you didn't know before reading this book, and that something will be good. There may be no amazing or startling new concepts, quick fixes or cures contained in these pages. But we can promise a lot of ideas, ways to cope and an interesting relevant story or two.
You wouldn't be wrong in feeling that we are all in this together.
Next is the Preface

About 60 members of the Appalachian State University Marching Mountaineers will travel to London for the 29th London New Year's Day Parade.
This is the second time the band has been invited to perform in what is dubbed "The World's Largest New Year's Day Parade," according to a news release from the college.
The first was in 2006 under the direction of former associate director of bands Dr. Scott Tobias. The band is currently directed by Dr. Kevin Richardson from the Hayes School of Music.
According to event organizers, the parade starts around noon and passes along the thoroughfares of Piccadilly, Regent Street and Whitehall, passing Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square on its two-mile path through the center of the historic City of Westminster, ending at Parliament Street in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.
Appalachian's marching band is one of 21 high school and university bands invited to perform in the 2015 parade. The event typically attracts more than 500,000 spectators and millions of viewers via the parade's worldwide television broadcast.
While in London, the students will visit sites such as the Tower of London, Greenwich Village, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, Oxford University, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.
This will be the marching band's third international performance in recent years. In 2011, the band was one of only two U.S. bands invited to perform in the Cabalgata de Reyes Parade in Madrid, Spain.

Today's gaming geeks can keep their Playstation 3s and their XBox 360s – there's only one machine that holds a place in my heart, the ZX Spectrum.
Although it boasted only about a millionth of the capacity of 2017's beh﻿emoths (48k was big in its day though), the ZX Spectrum, first produced by the British-based Sinclair Research Limited in 1982, caught the imagination of users and game designers for the better part of a decade, leaving an incredible legacy of more than 14,000 software titles.
With Sir Clive Sinclair's baby this year celebrating its 35th birthday (and interest in the machine reinvigorated by crowdfunded plug-n-play and hand-held consoles), it seems like a good time to dust off the tape deck and hit Load "" on eight of the greatest games made for "the Speccy".
Rubber keyboard, four-minute loading times - what's not to like about the ZX Spectrum?

* Handheld ZX Spectrum console announced
* Happy 30th birthday, ZX Spectrum
Bombjack (1986)
Bombjack brought the arcade home to your bedroom.
​Originally an arcade game staple at video parlours and fish-and-chip shop's around the land, this platformer provided endless hours of addictive fun whether using the Spectrum's trademark rubbery keyboard or flimsy joysticks.
Essentially an upgraded form of Pac Man, it was one of the many titles where the Speccy version was far superior to the rival Commodore 64's, even if they had Jean-Michel Jarre as its soundtrack.
Football Manager (1982)
Before Championship Manager and Fifa 17, there was Football Manager.
Without it there would have been no Championship Manager, or arguably even Fifa 17.
Yes the football action looks like the barely upgraded version of Pong, but the ability to manage your favourite English club from the fourth division to the first (this was well before the Premier League remember) meant many hours were lost to picking teams, organising transfers and watching the nail-biting "match highlights" play out in what seemed like super slo-motion.
The Hobbit (1982)
1982 text-based adventure The Hobbit was many young gamers first introduction to the Tolkien universe.
Before Peter Jackson embarked on their twin cinematic Tolkien trilogies, this (and the BBC Radio series) was the closest that non-reading kids got to the world of Smaug, Sauron and Saurman.
One of the first text adventures, it was both infuriating and entertaining in equal measure as you tried to find the right words to help you progress the adventure. Without this, it's likely there would have been no Leisure Suit Larry, which may or may not have been a good thing.
Knight Lore (1984)
Knight Lore introduced an extra-dimension to ZX Spectrum gameplay.
While many may argue that Ultimate Play the Games' later titles Batman and Head Over Heels were superior, there's something about this first monochromatic isometric adventure that just gives it an extra appeal.
It's most likely the fact that your lycanthropically cursed character (Sabreman) has slightly different skills depending on whether they are in wolf or human state, making the fiendish puzzles even more difficult and reliant on timing.
﻿ Shockway Rider (1987)
N/A Shockway Rider - Frogger with an Elvis-quiffed hero.
Sure it was essentially an updated version of Frogger, but this futuristic road-crossing game was made unputdownable by its Teddy-boy throwback protagonist and the ability to fight back against those standing in your path.
Interestingly the game's arc had you travelling through 12 districts. Maybe this was the inspiration for The Hunger Games?
Skool Daze (1984)
Skool Daze: An opportunity to rebel.
How many other computer games have let you play out your schoolyard fantasies?
Allegedly inspired by British cartoon characters like The Beano's Bash St Kids, this sees you playing naughty schoolboy Eric, whose objective is to steal their report card out of the staff room safe by accomplishing various tasks around the school.
Target: Renegade (1987)
Target: Renegade offered plenty of chop-socky action.
The boys' slumber party game of choice in the late 1980s, this scrolling beat-em-up game was even enjoyable simply as a spectator sport.
Your hero has to battle their way through increasingly difficult levels in order to avenge your brother's death at the hands of the evil Mr Big. A game so popular it even spawned a PC sequel almost 20 years later.
Turbo Esprit (1986)
Turbo Esprit offered "high-speed" driving action.
It was the 1980s equivalent of Grand Theft Auto. A car driving game, at least partially inspired by James Bond's For Your Eyes Only (that's where the Lotus Esprit part came from), this sees you trying to prevent a gang of drug smugglers completing a delivery of heroin.
The twist was – the only way to stop them was destroying their cars or ramming them into submission.
It's only been a few hours since Amazon revealed its new FireTV set-top box, giving us a good chunk of time to play around with it and get familiar with the new UI and controller.
Amazon hyped three big selling points for the FireTV, including speedy performance, easier search, and an open content community.
Where performance is concerned, Amazon certainly delivered.
We'll get to the full details in a formal review, but for now, features like “ASAP” (which learns what you are likely to watch and cues it up so you don't have to wait for it to load) and the ability to fast scroll through content categories is snappy as can be. And that's not putting it lightly.
I've owned high-end Rokus, a Samsung SmartTV, and an Apple TV and have never seen a media streaming player move so quickly.
That's not to say there's no loading screens whatsoever. Downloading apps takes a hot second, and shows that aren't cued up with ASAP still go through a loading process.
Where search is concerned, Amazon tried to solve this through voice controls. The new Amazon FireTV controller, equipped with Bluetooth so you don't need to point it at anything, has an embedded mic so that you can bring up certain titles, genres, etc. This, too, works pretty seamlessly.
You simply hold the microphone button on the remote, speak your query, and get answers back. It's quick. It's easier than typing. And it seems like a no brainer. Bravo, Amazon.
Finally, we come to content. Undoubtedly, Amazon's FireTV has plenty to choose from, including Netflix, Hulu+, WatchESPN, Showtime, Pandora, and thousands of games from the FireOS ecosystem. However, it is missing HBOGo, which is kind of a deal-breaker for me. Roku, Chromecast and Apple TV all serve up Girls and Game Of Thrones.
In terms of UI, I'm still undecided. Everything new takes some getting used to, but the dual panels on the left side, for FireTV options and then the subsequent categories for each of those options, has been confusing.
But let's get back to gaming. Amazon created a gaming experience to pair alongside the FireTV, that lets you use the remote, a dedicated gaming controller, or an app on your phone or tablet to game it up.
I'm still not convinced that this is a selling point to most people. If gaming is important to you, you probably own a console. If gaming is a secondary priority, you have the option to play games on your smartphone or tablet. The in-between space is a difficult one to tackle, but Amazon's original games seem relatively intriguing.
In other words, my initial impressions are that the gaming controller and gaming functionality are most certainly not a reason to buy the device, but may prove an interesting addition to the set-top box landscape.
The FireTV is $99, and the additional gaming controller is $29.99. HDMI cord not included.
We'll be hitting you with a full review in the next couple weeks, but until then, enjoy this little video and figure out your streaming priorities. We'll get this sorted out together.

Microsurgery surgery is a type of surgery performed under the magnification of a microscope. The blood vessels and nerves that supply fingers and small body parts such as ears, scalps, tongues and noses are so small that surgeons need to use a microscope to place sutures in blood vessel walls and nerve coverings. This process establishes or re-establishes connections for blood flow and nerve transmission.
Since 1970, California Pacific Medical Center's Microsurgery Service at the Davies Campus has performed thousands of successful reconstructive procedures, giving new hope to patients. We performed the first human toe-to-hand transplant in 1972, and in 1976 achieved the first scalp replant and the first four-digit replant in the United States.
Microsurgery services include:
Emergency Replantation Surgery — In these procedures, the immediate survival of the part depends on the reattachment of the blood vessels. But the ultimate goal is to restore function, so it's also crucial to repair bone, nerves, tendons and soft tissue. For severe damage, some patients may require follow-up reconstructive work.

But the ultimate goal is to restore function, so it's also crucial to repair bone, nerves, tendons and soft tissue. For severe damage, some patients may require follow-up reconstructive work. Microvascular Transplants — These are elective reconstruction operations, such as for defects created by trauma or cancer resection. Surgeons can transplant lower abdominal tissue to the chest to create a breast after mastectomy; a great toe to make a new thumb after thumb amputation; or, in a female-to-male gender affirmation operation, forearm tissue to the position of a phallus.

Nerve Repair and Nerve Grafting — During a nerve repair procedure, two ends of a nerve are sewn together to help the nerves regenerate. If there's extensive damage to a nerve and the two ends can't be connected, a nerve graft is used to bridge the gap.

It's tax season, which means that people all over America are nervously meeting with their accountants or sitting down with TurboTax, trying to figure out how much they owe Uncle Sam this year.
For law-abiding Bitcoin fans, tax season can be especially stressful. The IRS's guidelines for virtual currencies, laid down last year, classified Bitcoin as property for federal tax purposes. That means that, just as with any other financial asset, Bitcoin users are required to pay taxes whenever they sell or exchange Bitcoin for a gain.
As Steven Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center notes, the IRS's classification also means that Bitcoin users are triggering capital gains taxes whenever they buy anything with Bitcoin, if the value of their holdings has increased since the time of their initial purchase. (So, for example: if I buy a $10 pizza with a Bitcoin I originally bought for $2, I would owe capital gains taxes on the $8 difference.) These rules are complex, and require meticulous bookkeeping. So it's natural that some U.S.-based Bitcoiners—especially the more libertarian-leaning ones—might be tempted to, shall we say, use flexible accounting methods.
Of course, Bitcoiners would never knowingly dodge their tax duties. (And, since Bitcoin had such a horrible year in 2014, it's possible that many of them have incurred capital losses, which they wouldn't owe taxes on.) But just in case the IRS—or anyone else—would like to lend a helping hand, here are a few people who made Bitcoin purchases in 2014, and might need a little extra assistance settling this year's tax bills:
The Winklevoss Twins

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, probably the most famous Bitcoiners in the U.S., have said that they've never sold any of their Bitcoin holdings. But they did use the virtual currency to book a $250,000 space trip on Virgin Galactic last March—which is treated like a sale, for tax purposes. Depending on when they purchased those bitcoins, their capital gains taxes could amount to tens of thousands of dollars apiece.

Some of these transactions were probably too small to trigger more than a few cents of capital gains. But, hey, rules are rules. And given the stated desire of the Bitcoin community to clean up Bitcoin's public reputation, they'll no doubt appreciate our attempt to help them follow federal tax laws.
In the orange glow of grow lights, Aaron Justis is checking on their crop of medical marijuana. It's a tiny room, not much bigger than an average kitchen, in the back of their dispensary in the Los Angeles suburb of Studio City. But after last week's election, Justis says, he'll need a bigger greenhouse. Much, much bigger.
"I think it will just snowball what's already been happening," Justis says, "and really be the true tipping point to ending the war on cannabis."
California's medical marijuana industry is currently worth just under $3 billion, according to Josh Drayton, deputy director of the California Cannabis Industry Association.
Now that Californians voted to legalize recreational pot, the industry could more than double by 2020, according to an estimate from market research firm Arcview.
"We're going to see an economic rush," Drayton says. "Many folks are calling this the green rush. So we're definitely going to see a new economic base in the state of California."
Much of the capital is coming from Silicon Valley. Many wealthy tech moguls, like Napster founder Sean Parker, have invested in the industry. Others are hoping to become the Sean Parkers of marijuana, and get in on the ground floor of a burgeoning industry.
This is what selling weed in 2016 sounds like: a dozen 20-somethings clacking keyboards, crunching code, discussing panini options for lunch.

It's the San Francisco office of a four-year-old company called Eaze, started by Keith McCarty after they sold Yammer, an internal communication tool for businesses, to Microsoft for just over $1 billion.
"I was looking for the next wave of technology and became very bullish on this whole on-demand consumer service category. Looking at every product and service that was there, cannabis kept popping up as a natural fit."
'Three keystrokes' to order
Soon, adults across the state may be able to get a joint delivered faster than a pizza.
"Eaze's mission is to provide the easiest, quickest, most professional way to get access to cannabis in about 15 minutes' delivery and make it available wherever it's allowed."
Frequent medicinal marijuana customer Breauna Kading takes a break from their job running a tech hub to demonstrate how it works.
"It offers a menu of what's available in your area based on your address," they say. "You pick from there, and it's literally three keystrokes. Order what you want, check out, place order and you're done."
They fire up the app and decides what they want — in this case, a vape pen that dispenses medical-grade cannabis. About 20 minutes later, it arrives.

"I''ve had my Eaze come to me much faster than my Uber's gotten here," Kading says.
Right now, Eaze is for prescription patients only. But once they get a licence to sell recreational product, they'll be able to deliver to anyone over 21.
"California is the largest market — it's about half of the cannabis market in the world — and Eaze is in about 100 cities in California," McCarty says.
And as more states and more countries legalize marijuana, McCarty says, Eaze plans to expand — into Canada and beyond.
"I think this is a global market over the next five years," McCarty says.
California expects to reap about $1 billion in tax revenue a year from legal marijuana sales.
The 'downside' effects
But University of Southern California economist Joel Hay says it's not worth the cost to the health care system, and to society.
"I think a lot of the downside effects are unquestionable," Hay says. The use of marijuana has gone up in Colorado and Washington state since recreational marijuana was legalized, but the tax revenues are "nowhere near what's needed to cope with the long-term problems.
My estimate is that the cost of marijuana to society is about $30 a day for chronic users. - Joel Hay, University of Southern California economist
That money, they say, is needed to treat conditions like psychological addiction, an increase in schizophrenia, the resulting car accidents because marijuana causes a "two to three times increase in traffic fatalities."
There are also less tangible effects like loss of productivity.
Hay acknowledges that legalization in the world's sixth-largest economy might well influence other jurisdictions to follow suit. But they hope it's a passing — and reversible — fad.
"It's a tipping point in a pendulum that I hope will swing back in the other direction, as people gain more sensibility about this product," Hay says. "Keep in mind that marijuana was legal in this country back at the turn of the 20th century -- as, by the way, were even more addictive and dangerous drugs like cocaine."
Big Weed could muscle in
And there are still so many other unknowns, like what will president-elect Trump will do when they take office. But many small operators are more worried about getting muscled aside by so-called Big Weed.
Aaron Justis, of the Los Angeles medical marijuana dispensary Buds & Roses Collective, smells money in those buds. (Kim Brunhuber/CBC News)
"I am definitely scared for the future of my place, and a lot of other people's in this industry, but that's just because it's a growing industry, and it's just harder and harder to stay competitive," Justis says. "The truth is, in Los Angeles, where we're located, it has been the wild west forever."
Bring it on, they say. It will likely take two years before they get the appropriate permit to start selling to non-medicinal consumers. By then, they say, he'll be ready.
In their makeshift greenhouse, they go around from plant to plant, sniffing the buds.
"Ah! beautiful!" they say.
What does it smell like? It smells like money.
When preparing for a backpack trip there are a lot of things to consider regarding storage space, for me the hardest decision was what camera to take with me...
*Prague Astronomical Clock*
Traveling is something I always enjoyed, from meeting new people and places, to the stressful situation where you don't know how you will get to the next destination.
*Prague Train Station*
For most people trip photographs are mostly a way to remember vividly their journeys and to take an analog camera with them is a risk only few are willing to take.
When preparing for a backpack trip there are a lot of things to consider regarding storage space, for me the hardest decision was what camera to take with me, I would love to take all my Nikon gear but that would take more than half of the space in my bag. After too much thinking I decided to only take a Nikon F3 and a 50mm lens, but when I was about to take it a weird feeling directed my attention to an old Leica IIIc, I took the camera and gladly saw that it fitted my jacket pocket.
*Prague National Museum*
Is a well known fact that old Leicas are a pain to load and I had terrible experiences when finishing a roll and when trying to rewind it realizing that it wasn't well placed so it didn't advance at all.
*Berlin Holocaust Memorial*
I took the risk after my friend and mentor Matteo Prezioso told me that "it would be a good opportunity to master it".
Photos of new places are not too hard to take, as everything is new for your eyes there's always a good chance of getting a great shoot if you know how to compose properly. I didn't have to focus a lot cause almost all the photos where taken from far away so the focus ring was always set to infinity, exposing was not a big deal either due the fact that the weather was very stable (either cloudy or very sunny) so I measured one or two times per day using my cell phone (LightMeter Free) and tried to adjust by eye when light changes occurred.
*Warzaw Łazienki Park*
Roll after roll, city after city, I got very comfortable with the camera to the point where I was loading the rolls without thinking about it.
When I got my rolls back from the lab I was amazed, I didn't have high expectations, I knew that there were some light leaks but I'm cool with that, the sharpness and contrast weren't something I was expecting.

Have you ever gone out to your local sports bar with a couple of staunch pals? You sit around, drinking a quality beer for the price of a six-pack as you and your friends joke about whatever topic has come to mind. It's a great time. You're having fun. But inevitably it happens.
The conversation dwindles. Before long the group of you are sitting in a palpable silence. Eyes start to wander for anything of interest. You find yourself watching the highlight reel on whatever sports network is sprawled across the half-dozen LED flat screens that cover every blank spot on the wall. The thought quickly pops into your noggin.
“Man. Sports are boring.”
Don't get me wrong. We here at AiPT welcome all walks of life. If you're a sports nut, be that nut. We still love you. But call it a hunch when I theorize that a majority of you lovely people would rather have a controller in your hands than watch Team A play Team B in preseason.
Enter the nerd bar. A quick Googlin' shows that there already has been dabbling in the market that seems to be successful. The Mana Bar (Best name ever. Period.) in Australia is a proud chain of two that offers tasty beverages and multiple screens hosting different platforms for multiplayer fun. Different games every night and the ability to buy video games at the bar make me want to book a flight right now.
Stateside—in Vegas, of course—We have Insert Coin(s) (silver medal in the name competition). With over 50 arcade machines to swallow your quarters and a comfortable lounge environment you wont even have to waste your money on Blackjack and strippers! I mean, you will anyway but that's why you go. No judgment.
These pioneers have the right idea, but what I'm thinking of is an entirely different animal. It goes back to that night at the bar watching two sports teams that aren't even from here battle it out. What would I rather be watching? You guessed it. Live stream matches of all your favorite PvP games.
Riveting.
You could stream League of Legends, DOTA, Starcraft 2, Call of Duty, WoW Arenas or Street Fighter. The list goes on. People stream these games at all hours of the day! All you need to do is log on. It could be a gathering for championship tournaments or just a few screens dedicated to whoever is ruling the leader boards. I'd be much more interested in that whilst sipping on my $5 beverage, to say the least.
And it doesn't stop there. Other TVs could host the video games du'jour (a la Mana Bar) for a cultural interaction you can't even get in a sports bar. Strangers start playing Tekken with other strangers but by the end of the night (and a few beers) they leave as friends. Doesn't it just sound magical?
Magical? MAGIC! There could be a designated area for tabletop games. With designated drink holders to avoid spillage onto your [insert funny reference to valuable Magic: The Gathering card here].
I consider myself a full-on nerd but this game terrifies me.
I've been to bars that provide you with “Jenga” or “Guess Who” and you know what? It was f-----g awesome. Move beyond that and have a Settlers of Catan collection. Have a few stacks of Munchkin cards that people can loan out for a few hours. Jesus Christ, remember Heroclix? Get some mother f-----g Heroclix up in there.
Thrown in some comfortable lounge chairs and projections of Episode V on the wall and I'll say you have a Goddamned utopia on your hands. A nerd haven, if you will. Man-babies would flock to it. People would turn it into the final destination of their countrywide trek.
Before I get too carried away, I know it's a gamble. Arcades are all but a thing of the past and for what it's worth you can just as easily sit on your couch and be brutally defeated by a------s you don't know.
I only dream fondly of a world without the shackles of popular culture. A world where my bartender happens to be dressed up like Misty even though no one told them to do that. I dream of a place where I would not be shunned for playing Dungeons and Dragons yet for some reason they can prattle on for hours about their fantasy football teams.
Does this not sound like the most nerdy thing in existence?
If I had the money it would be built already. But I don't have the money, or the liquor license, or any of the valuable qualities one needs to run a stable and successful business. Perhaps one day I will.
For now, I can only dream.
We need to talk about something, friends.
This much is true: Auston Matthews is probably going to win the Calder Trophy as the NHL's best rookie.
There's an argument that Winnipeg's Patrik Laine, currently the league's second-leading goal scorer, is right behind Matthews. And if either of those players wins, fine, you won't hear much groaning from the gallery.
But the fact that Zach Werenski can't get a sniff in this conversation is absolutely baffling. In fact, it's legitimately insulting.
Let's step back in time for just a moment.
When the Blue Jackets took a deep breath and evaluated their 2015-16 season (gulp), one item brought up by head coach John Tortorella was the idea of changing their style of play. They felt that, with the pieces in place and some potential pieces on the way, they could be more aggressive, take chances, and push the pace up the ice.
Where it started, they reasoned, was on the back end.
The trade for Seth Jones got those wheels into motion. Watching Werenski in the Calder Cup playoffs accelerated the thinking even more; if this kid could play in the NHL this season, they could transform their style.
And they did, to the tune of 27 wins in their first 36 games.
Werenski didn't dip their toes in the big-league waters – they straight up cannonballed and splashed the folks relaxing in pool chairs. Some of the things he's been able to do are just mind-boggling, including running the point on one of the NHL's best power play units and not looking the least bit out of place.
They were the NHL's Rookie of the Month in November:
He's played at least 20 minutes in 40 of 65 games this season. Assistant coach Brad Shaw, who runs the defense, isn't afraid to use them in any situation. Sure, there have been games where Shaw preferred a particular matchup and shortened the bench (giving Werenski a rest), but by and large they haven't been sheltered. At 19, he's one of two Blue Jackets defensemen (Jack Johnson is the other) to play in each of the team's first 65 games this season.
What's most impressive is Werenski's ability to drive play when he's on the ice at even strength.
Their 5-on-5 Corsi number is 53.48%, tops among Blue Jackets blue-liners. Right behind them is defense partner Seth Jones (an old man at 22 years old) at 52.65%, which is stats-speak for saying they don't spend a lot of time in their own zone. Wondering why the Blue Jackets have the league's third-best goal differential? Look no further.
Secondly, I'll grant you this: it has been a tremendous season for rookies in the NHL. Probably one of the best we'll see for a while. Laine has 32 goals in only 60 games, Matthews has 31 in 66, and Mitch Marner is leading the Maple Leafs with 37 assists.
Werenski, a defenseman, has the sixth-most points among NHL rookies (39) and is on pace for a 50-point season. Yes, that's correct: 50 points. As a defenseman. A rookie defenseman.
ESPN.com's Craig Custance wrote this strong piece on Werenski and their adjustment to the long, grueling NHL season. Here's a clip that stood out:
At times, especially earlier this month, it looked as though Werenski might be slowing down after a hot start to their NHL career. They were taken off Columbus' first power-play unit to help shift focus to their defense and their play without the puck. They went their longest stretch without registering a point -- six games -- to start February. With a tough veteran such as John Tortorella as their first NHL coach, the teenage defenseman could have been forgiven if they were afraid to speak up and went into a bit of a shell. It has taken veterans more than a season to feel comfortable going to Tortorella with issues. Not Werenski. When the offense started to dry up, they approached Tortorella with a solution. "He said, 'Sometimes I don't get enough touches and I'm not in the game,'" Tortorella said. "That's what's cool about him. That's what's really neat about him."
He's a significant player on a Blue Jackets team that, as of Friday, has the second-most points in the entire league and has allowed the second-fewest goals (143 in 65 games).
It's time to give more credit where more credit is due. This kid is the real deal, and is a big reason why the Blue Jackets are on the verge of breaking franchise records for wins and points.
A small group of Muslims in Halifax want to start a unity mosque where openly gay and transgender Muslims can pray and women would be allowed to lead followers in prayer.
Syed Adnan Hussein wants to create a space where gay or transgender Muslims can be themselves while they pray — which they said doesn't happen at other mosques.
"It's not so much that they're not welcome, but they can't affirm that aspect of their identity," they said.
"You can be a queer but you can't affirm your identity when you're in a religious space like a mosque. So you couldn't, for example, be trans and decide that you wanted to pray on the women's side if you looked more male."
But Muslim scholars say the Qur'an is clear on homosexuality.
"What the Qur'an says clearly, just like the Bible, that homosexuality is not accepted," said Jamal Badawi, a professor emeritus at Saint Mary's University in Halifax.
"It is not regarded as the norm in terms of the needs of society and the relationship between men and women."
Badawi said people shouldn't misinterpret what they or the Qur'an says. They said Islam does not preach violence or hatred against gay or transgender people.
"There is a big difference between disagreement and discrimination. You can disagree with people and their views," they said.
"Everybody's entitled to the right to agree or disagree with anybody's ideas. But discrimination, that's what we all should be against."
Several imams in Halifax said everyone is welcome in the city's five mosques regardless of their sexual orientation. They told CBC News they have not heard of or met a gay or transgender Muslim in the city.
"All mosques, everybody is welcome in the mosque regardless of race, colour, gender, whatever," said Imam Ibrahim Alshanti, of the United Muslims of Halifax.
"To open a new mosque specially for these people, maybe it's not necessary."
No one has an accurate count of gay or transgender Muslims in Nova Scotia.
But Hussein said numbers aren't important — having a choice of where to pray openly is.
"To me, creating a spiritual space where all are equal is really important because that might impact their lives outside of the spiritual arena as well," they said.
There is currently a significant attack being launched at a large number of WordPress blogs across the Internet. The attacker is brute force attacking the WordPress administrative portals, using the username "admin" and trying thousands of passwords. It appears a botnet is being used to launch the attack and more than tens of thousands of unique IP addresses have been recorded attempting to hack WordPress installs.
One of the concerns of an attack like this is that the attacker is using a relatively weak botnet of home PCs in order to build a much larger botnet of beefy servers in preparation for a future attack. These larger machines can cause much more damage in DDoS attacks because the servers have large network connections and are capable of generating significant amounts of traffic. This is a similar tactic that was used to build the so-called itsoknoproblembro/Brobot botnet which, in the Fall of 2012, was behind the large attacks on US financial institutions.
Patching the Internet
We just pushed a rule out through CloudFlare's WAF that detects the signature of the attack and stops it. Rather than limiting this to only paying customers, CloudFlare is rolling it out the fix to all our customers automatically, including customers on our free plan. If you are a WordPress user and you are using CloudFlare, you are now protected from this latest brute force attack.
Because CloudFlare sits in front of a significant portion of web requests we have the opportunity to, literally, patch Internet vulnerabilities in realtime. We will be providing information about the attack back to partners who are interested in hardening their internal defenses for customers who are not yet on CloudFlare.
If you are running a WordPress blog and want to ensure you are protected from this attack, you can sign up for CloudFlare's free plan and the protection is automatic. We'll continue to monitor the details of the attack and publish details about what we learn.
The "Parenthood" star will adapt "Someday, Someday, Maybe" for the youth-skewing network, with Ellen DeGeneres and Jeff Kleeman on board to executive produce.
Lauren Graham is returning to The CW.
The youth-skewing network has picked up the script for an adaptation of Graham's debut novel, Someday, Someday, Maybe, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
Based on The New York Times best-selling novel, Graham will pen the script and executive produce the drama for Warner Bros. Television. Ellen DeGeneres, who regularly has their friend and Parenthood star Graham on their show as a guest, will executive produce the project with Jeff Kleeman through their A Very Good Production banner.
PHOTOS: The CW's 2013-14 Season: 'The Originals,' 'Tomorrow People' and 'Reign'
The drama -- a fictionalized story about their experience acting during the 1990s -- centers on a young woman with six months left on their three-year plan to make a career as an actor in New York City.
The news comes two months after word leaked that Graham was developing their best-seller as a potential TV series and returns the actor to the network where they starred on The WB -- and later The CW's -- on Gilmore Girls, one of the series that helped jump-start the young network. The project also reteams Graham with Gilmore Girls studio Warner Bros. Television, who produced all seven seasons of the series that co-starred Alexis Bledel.
Graham is repped by ICM Partners, John Carrabino Management and Hansen Jacobson.

The Islamic State group released a video purporting to show a young boy executing an Arab Israeli who infiltrated it in Syria to spy for the Jewish state.
In the video, a youth identifying themselves as 19-year-old Mohammed Said Ismail Musallam recounts how they were recruited by Israeli intelligence.
Dressed in an orange jumpsuit that is standard in videos of IS executions, they are shown kneeling in front of the boy, who appears to be no more than 12 years old, and a man standing at theirs side.
The man, speaking in French, issues threats against Jews in France, before it appears that the boy walks around in front of the hostage and shoots them in the forehead with a pistol.
The boy, who shouts 'Allahu Akbar' ('God is greatest'), then shoots the man four more times as they lie on the ground.
However, the video has been edited in such a way that the boy is not actually seen firing the gun.
In February, Musallam's father denied in comments to AFP the IS claim that their son was an Israeli agent.
"My son is innocent; IS accused them of working for Mossad because they tried to run away," Said Musallam said, claiming that their son had travelled to Syria to join the jihadists.
"He is absolutely not religious," Musallam said, adding that perhaps their son had been recruited through the Internet.
Dabiq, the IS online English-language magazine, said Mohammed had been tasked by Israel with gathering information on IS bases and weapons and on Palestinians volunteering to fight for the group in Syria.
A spokesperson for Israel's Shin Bet security service told AFP Mohammed had left home on October 24 "on their own initiative", implying that they had not been sent by Israel.
Official Israeli policy is not to comment on such allegations.
The Shin Bet spokesperson said Mohammed travelled from Israel to Turkey and "from there crossed to Syria and joined IS to fight for the organisation".
Said Musallam said their son, an Israeli citizen, abandoned their national service in the fire department to join IS.
They said the last time they spoke by phone Mohammed was in Raqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the jihadist "caliphate" in northern Syria.
They said their son wanted to return home after having completing basic training.
They said they were very worried about their son's fate at the hands of IS, which has brutally executed many prisoners in recent months.
Asked if they could raise a ransom in exchange for their son, the father said they were a mere bus driver with no property or assets to theirs name.
The family lives in the Jewish settlement neighbourhood of Neve Yaakov in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
Said Musallam was born in the occupied West Bank but said their four children have Israeli passports.
According to Dabiq, Mohammed was recruited in Neve Yaakov by a Jewish neighbour working for the security services and was given away by their behaviour and their refusal to obey a commander.
Islamic State blows up key Tikrit bridge
The Islamic State group blew up the only bridge over the Tigris river in the entire Tikrit area as Iraqi forces continued to seal off the city.
"The bridge was blown up by Daesh," a police colonel said, using an Arab acronym for the jihadist organisation.
"A whole segment at the western end of the bridge collapsed."
An army lieutenant colonel said: "Their goal is to slow the advance of Iraqi troops because the bridge is the only way into Tikrit from the east."
The village of Albu Ajil, which Iraqi forces retook on Sunday, is on the eastern side of the river, as is the town of Al-Alam, where jihadist fighters expelled from rural areas have been regrouping.
Ad-Dawr, the other town where IS fighters have been trying to resist the huge operation launched on March 2 to retake Tikrit, lies south of the city on the eastern bank of the Tigris.
Commanders from the army and the government-controlled Popular Mobilisation units have been closing in on the three urban centres over the past week.
They have said their goal was to lay siege to Tikrit, a Sunni city about 160km north of Baghdad which has been under IS control for nine months.
The city, which is the home town of former president Saddam Hussein, is the toughest target for the government troops and allied militias that started winning back lost ground last year.
The operation initially involved 30,000 men backed by Iraqi aircraft.
The IS is believed to have only a few hundred men inside Tikrit, but government forces have said their advance has been slowed by large numbers of roadside bombs and booby traps planted by the jihadists all around the city.
Editor's note: Amid the heated debate over Arizona's SB 1062 law, which aims to protect religious liberty, it's worth looking back at some of the ways that religious beliefs have come under attack in the public square in recent years. The language in this post that is quoted originally appeared in a National Review Online article by Ryan T. Anderson and Leslie Ford. Kelsey Harris also contributed to this article.
1. Elane Photography
Elane Huguenin and their husband, Jon, run Elane Photography, a small business in Albuquerque, N.M.
Back in 2006, the couple declined a request to photograph a same-sex ceremony because of a difference in beliefs. Elane explained:
“The message a same-sex commitment ceremony communicates is not one I believe.”
Elane Photography never refused to take pictures of gay and lesbian individuals, but it did decline to photograph a same-sex ceremony. Meanwhile, other photographers in the Albuquerque area were more than happy to photograph the event — and Elane has no problem giving them that business.
But in 2008, the New Mexico Human Rights Commission ruled that the Huguenins had discriminated based on sexual orientation. The commission ordered them to pay $6,637.94 in attorneys' fees.
At the end of 2013, the New Mexico Supreme Court upheld the Human Rights Commission. It concluded that under the state's sexual-orientation and gender-identity law, “the First Amendment does not protect a photographer's freedom to decline to take pictures of a same-sex commitment ceremony even when doing so would violate the photographer's deeply held religious beliefs.”
Elane Photography has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review of its case.
2. Sweet Cakes by Melissa
When Rachel Cryer and Laurel Bowman asked the Oregon bakery Sweet Cakes by Melissa to bake a wedding cake for their same-sex commitment ceremony in 2013, Sweet Cakes declined the request.
The bakery owners consistently served all customers on a regular basis, but making a cake for the Cryer and Bowman would have required them to facilitate and celebrate a same-sex relationship — which would violate their religious belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.
It's a value derived from their very-open Christian beliefs. Check out this picture the bakery shared on their Facebook wall.
P.S. — Oregon law defines marriage as being between one man and one woman, too.
But the lesbian couple filed a complaint under the Oregon Equality Act of 2007, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. In January, the agency issued a ruling that held that the Sweet Cakes by Melissa violated Oregon's sexual-orientation law when by refusing to bake the cake.
As the story gained local media attention, the owners, Melissa and Aaron Klein, immediately faced threats, vicious protests, and boycotts.
Fearing for their safety, the Kleins closed Sweet Cakes by Melissa in September 2013.
3. Masterpiece Cakeshop
Meet Jack Phillips, who owns Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado.
They declined to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding reception for these guys:
In 2012, the couple received a marriage license in Massachusetts and asked Phillips to bake a cake for a reception back home in Denver. But because of their faith, Phillips declined to create a wedding cake:
“I don't feel like I should participate in their wedding, and when I do a cake, I feel like I am participating in the ceremony or the event or the celebration that the cake is for.”
But the American Civil Liberties Union disagrees. They “filed a complaint against Masterpiece Cakeshop with the state, alleging violations of Colorado's public-accommodation law. Administrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer ruled against the bakery on December 6, 2013, concluding that Phillips violated the law by refusing service to the two men ‘because of their sexual orientation.'”
Phillips' response: objection.
They said he'd happily sell the couple their baked goods for any number of occasions, but baking a wedding cake would force them to express something that they do not believe, violating their freedom to run their business in step with their faith.
“It's just the wedding cake, not the people. Not the lifestyle. … We'd close down the bakery before we compromise our beliefs.”
4. Arlene's Flowers
Barronelle Stutzman owns Arlene's Flowers and Gifts in Washington State.
Them longtime customers Roger Ingersoll and Curt Freed requested they arrange the flowers for their same-sex wedding ceremony.
Stutzman responded that they “could not accept the job because of their ‘relationship with Jesus Christ' and their belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.”
But the couple filed a complaint and Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed suit “against Stutzman, contending that they had violated the state's sexual-orientation law.”
Now Stutzman faces $2,000 fine, a court order, and outrage from local residents. Here's a Facebook page with 626 supporters.
As these cases show, religious liberty and discrimination are almost certainly matters that both courts and citizens will tackle and struggle with in the upcoming years.
A group of masked settlers attacked a number of left-wing activists in the West Bank on Friday, beating them with baseball bats and stones, according to a video of the incident captured by one of the activists and published by left-wing NGO B'Tselem.
The group, which collects information on alleged human rights violations by Israelis and Israeli authorities against Palestinians, said the activists that were attacked were from another left-wing organization, Ta'ayush, an Arab and Jewish political activist group.
B'Tselem said the incident occurred near the village of Al-Auja in the Jordan Valley and that Palestinian villagers were also attacked. The attackers were said to be youths from a nearby outpost, Baladim.

Three activists were wounded in the attack, according to B'Tselem including Rabbi Arik Asherman, formerly of Rabbis for Human Rights, and Dr. Amiel Vardi, an academic and one of the founders of Ta'ayush.
In the clip, filmed by former B'Tselem spokesperson Sarit Michaeli, over a dozen masked youths are seen rushing at the activists, screaming obscenities and hurling stones and swinging sticks and bats.
Ascherman can be seen being hit with a club or baseball bat. Michaeli, holding the camera shouts “Don't attack me!” several times during the clip.
An IDF helicopter then flies very close to the settlers and they disperse and leave. The rest of the clip follows the attackers as they walk away until they disappear from view.
In a post on the Facebook page of Peace Now linking to the YouTube clip, the NGO said it “seeks the public's help in distributing this difficult-to-watch clip, so that the media becomes aware and we may finally hear the government's response to the hilltop criminals,” a phrase referring to young, violent Jewish settler activists.
“At least 5 human rights activist were wounded today following a harsh and violent attack by settlers from the Baladim outpost. Yes – the same outpost from which the criminals who attacked IDF soldiers last week,” read the post on Peace Now's page, in reference to a recent incident not widely reported that saw settlers from the outpost attack an IDF patrol car near the extremist outpost.
The soldiers arrived after receiving a report that Palestinians were in the area and there was concern that the two sides may clash. When the soldiers arrived, they did not see any Palestinians, but the settlers started throwing rocks at them.
In a video from the incident, a group of some half a dozen youths are seen pelting the IDF vehicle with stones. The police later arrested one person in connection with the incident and said more arrested were expected.
Peace Now said Friday that the government ignored last week's incident and “today they attacked activists from the Ta'ayush organization who came to accompany Palestinian shepherds and protect them from settler attacks.”
“Will they again ignore this and let a group of hoodlums takes the law into their hands and risk the activists' lives?” the group wrote on Facebook.

Jacques Cartier, navigator (born between 7 June and 23 December 1491 in Saint-Malo, France; died 1 September 1557 in Saint-Malo, France). From 1534 to 1542, Cartier led three maritime expeditions to the interior of the Gulf of the St. Lawrence River. During these expeditions, they explored, but more importantly accurately mapped for the first time, the interior of the river, from the Gulf to Montréal. For this navigational prowess, Cartier is still considered by many as the founder of “Canada”, even though, at the time, this term described only the region immediately surrounding Québec. Cartier's upstream navigation of the St. Lawrence River in the 16th century ultimately led to France occupying this part of North America.
Voyages to the Americas
Cartier's early life is very poorly documented. Employed in business and navigation from a young age, like their countrymen Cartier probably sailed along the coast of France, Newfoundland and South America (Brazil), first as a sailor and then as an officer. Nonetheless, it was the favourable political context following the annexation of Brittany to the kingdom of France that prompted King François 1 to choose Cartier to replace the explorer Giovanni da Verrazano, who had died on their last voyage.
First Voyage (1534)
Cartier's orders for their first expedition were to search for a passage to the Pacific Ocean in the area around Newfoundland and possibly find precious metals. They left Saint-Malo on 20 April 1534 with two ships and 61 men and reached the coast of Newfoundland 20 days later. During their journey, Cartier passed several sites known to European fishers; they renamed them or noted them on their maps. After skirting the north shore of Newfoundland, Cartier and their ships entered the Gulf of St. Lawrence by the Strait of Belle Isle and travelled south, hugging the coast of the Magdalen Islands on 26 June and reaching what are now the provinces of Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick three days later. They then navigated towards the west, crossing Chaleur Bay and reaching Gaspé, where they encountered Iroquois-speaking Aboriginal people from the region of Québec, who had come to the area for their annual seal hunt. After the planting a cross and engaging in some trading and negotiations, Cartier's ships left on 25 July with two of the Iroquois chief Donnacona's sons and returned to France by following the coast of Anticosti Island and re-crossing the Strait of Belle Isle.
Second Voyage (1535-6)
The expedition of 1535 was more important than the first expedition and included 110 people and three medium-sized ships – the Grande Hermine [the Great Stoat], the Petite Hermine [the Lesser Stoat] and the Émérillon [the Merlin] – which had been adapted for river navigation. They left Brittany in mid-May 1535 and reached Newfoundland after a long, 50-day crossing. Following the itinerary from the previous year, they entered the Gulf, then travelled the “Canada River” (later named the St. Lawrence River) upstream, guided by the Iroquois chief's sons to the village of Stadacona on the site of what is now the city of Québec. Given the extent of their planned explorations, the French decided to spend the winter there and settled at the mouth of the St. Charles River. Against the advice of Chief Donnacona, Cartier decided to continue sailing up the river towards Hochelaga, now the city of Montréal, which they reached on 2 October 1535. There they met other Iroquois, who tantalized Cartier with the prospect of a sea in the middle of the country. By the time Cartier returned to Stadacona (Québec), relations with the Aboriginal people there had deteriorated, but they nonetheless helped the poorly organized French to survive scurvy thanks to a remedy made from evergreen trees. When spring came, the French decided to return to Europe and took a dozen Stadaconiens with them as hostages. However, rumours of a kingdom rich in precious metals encouraged the French to resume their explorations of the area.
Third Voyage (1541-2)
The war in Europe led to a delay in returning to Canada, with the further result that the plans for the voyage were changed. This expedition was to include close to 800 people and involve a major attempt to colonize the region. The explorations were left to Cartier, but the logistics and colonial management of the expedition were entrusted to Jean-François de La Rocque, sieur de Roberval a senior military officer who was responsible for recruitment, loading weapons onto the ships, and bringing on craftsmen and a number of prisoners. Just as the expedition was to begin, delays in the preparations and the vagaries of the war with Spain meant that only half the personnel (led by Cartier) were sent to Canada in May 1541 by Roberval, who eventually came the following year. Cartier and their men settled the new colony several kilometres upstream from Québec at the confluence of the Cap Rouge and St. Lawrence rivers. While the colonists and craftsmen built the forts, Cartier decided to sail toward Hochelaga, but when they returned, a bloody battle had broken out with the Stadaconiens.
Return to France
In a state of relative siege during the winter, and not expecting the arrival of Roberval until spring, Cartier decided to abandon the colony at the end of May, having first filled a dozen barrels with what they believed were precious stones and metal. At a stop in St. John's, Newfoundland, however, Cartier met de La Rocque de Roberval's fleet and was given the order to return to Cap Rouge. Refusing to obey, Cartier sailed toward France under the cover of darkness. The stones and metal that they brought back turned out to be worthless and Cartier was never reimbursed by the king for the money they had borrowed from the Breton merchants. After this misadventure, they returned to business and died about fifteen years later at their estate at Limoilou near Saint-Malo. Cartier nonetheless kept their reputation as the first European to have explored and mapped this part of the Americas, which later became the French axis of power in North America.
Thisreports on February 13, 2011, that a former Labour Party member of parliament, Declan Bree , has joined the United Left Alliance (ULA). Another Irish left organisation has also backed the newly formed ULA. The ULA presently consists of three political parties: the Socialist Party, the People Before Profit Alliance and the Workers and Unemployed Action Group. Socialist Democracy , the party aligned with the Fourth International has released the following statement.
* * *
Statement from Ireland's Socialist Democracy on the February 25 general election.
February 7, 2011 -- We have been lied to, we have been cheated and we have been treated as fools. We have had our salaries cut, our pension money stolen, our taxes increased and social welfare cut. Our young people are emigrating and hundreds of thousands are unemployed. Social welfare is being slashed and our health and education services are being decimated.
And we are only into the first year of a four-year plan to make all these things even worse!
We are being told that we must pay for the economic crisis even though we had nothing to do with creating it. In fact salt is being rubbed into our wounds because all the sacrifices we are being ordered to make are to save those really responsible for the crisis. The money that is taken off us is being handed over to the bankers and developers who created this mess in the first place. The bankers continue to pay themselves bonuses and NAMA hands our money over to property developers to finish their projects.
Why?
It is not only the bankers who created this mess. The government encouraged the speculation and wants us to pay to save the banks. The Department of Finance and the Regulator failed to prevent the speculation. Every part of the establishment and the Irish State failed the ordinary people of Ireland.
Those who are supposed to defend us failed us. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) was in partnership with this government every year Fianna Fail was in power. David Begg, the leader of ICTU, sat on the board of the Central Bank when it failed to regulate the banks and failed to do anything to prevent the disaster.
The whole elite and their economic system have failed us. Their entire political system is rotten and corrupt and now we are told we must do the bidding of unelected bureaucrats from the European Union and IMF. We don't just need a change of government. We need an entirely new state and an entirely new social and economic system.
We need a new republic, a second republic, a WORKERS' REPUBLIC! We need to return to the promise of James Connolly and the fight for our independence in 1916. It promised that the ownership of Ireland would belong to the people of Ireland and that all the children of Ireland would be cherished equally.
This promise has been betrayed. The economic crisis has torn away the veil of lies from all the main parties who want the ordinary people to pay for this crisis. From Fianna Fail to the leadership of ICTU they differ only over how long they want the cuts to be implemented and what precise cuts we will have to endure.
The alternative
There is only one group of candidates who oppose all cuts. One group that opposes us paying for the banks mistakes and who oppose sacrificing our futures and that of our children for the EU and IMF. Only the candidates of the United Left Alliance offer this. As supporters of the ULA:
We are opposed to all cuts. All the main parties say that there is no money but this is not the real problem. All these parties supported borrowing billions to bail out the banks. We never heard any talk of a lack of money then. If they wanted to raise money to defend working people they could propose taxing the rich, the big corporations and use the wealth from the Corrib gas field. Instead they want to protect the big corporations and save the richest in our society such as the bankers and property developers.
We stand for total repudiation of the debt. We cannot pay it and we will not pay it! We did not borrow this money; the bankers did and Fianna Fail did. At this election we will show what we think of both of them. After the election we should not meekly pay their bills. The next step in the EU/IMF deal is to restructure the banks but these rotten institutions should not be saved with workers' money. We need a new bank that not only is funded by working people but is owned and run by them; a worker co-operative designed not to fund property speculation but to fund real economic and social development.
We stand for complete rejection of the EU and IMF deal. The EU and IMF are ordering the Irish people to bail out British and German bankers who stupidly lent to the Irish banks.
In all country workers are asked to undercut each other's wages, services and welfare in a race to the bottom from which only the rich can win. We should not compete with other workers. We should unite with them. Our solidarity should be with those facing the same situation as us – not Irish bankers. For this we need a new Europe. A Europe of the workers not a Europe of the bankers.
We have waited a long time for this election. We all want to punish those who have threatened our future but we will be no further forward if we vote for parties which want to continue the same policies as Fianna Fail. These parties have conspired with Fianna Fail to force the Finance Bill through the Dail and impose crippling cuts. After the election they will soon tell you that the Fianna Fail way is the only way.
This is your chance to vote for an alternative. But your vote will not be enough. Just as we cannot rely on the Dail parties during the election we will have to rely on ourselves after it. We must organise in our unions and our communities to defend our livelihoods and give our children a future.
Only ONE group stand opposed to ALL cuts, to paying the debts of the BANKERS and opposing the bullying of the EU and IMF. Vote for and sign up to the United Left Alliance!
This leaflet has been produced by supporters of the United Left Alliance who are members and supporters of Socialist Democracy. You can contact us: Socialist Democracy or contact the United Left Alliance.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't out until next month, but many of the superhero sequel's core cast, including the Peter Quill-playing Christ Pratt, have already shot scenes for Avengers: Infinity War, which is being directed by the Russo brothers and will be released May 4, 2018. So, what has that been like?
“It was really incredible,” says Pratt. “It seemed like a dream, as so much of these past few years has felt, like a weird fever dream where you're waking up and you're not sure if you're hallucinating or not.”
For more on this week's cover story, watch EW The Show, available now here, on the new PEOPLE/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to PEOPLE.com/PEN, or download the free app on your Smart TV, mobile and web devices.
Pratt says that working with Robert Downey Jr. was a treat and an exciting challenge, as well as the culmination of a long-in-the-works plan by Guardians franchise director James Gunn.
“Early on, James said that, when they were casting the role of Quill, they were thinking of somebody who was gonna one day be in a scene opposite Robert Downey Jr. They knew that character had that potential, that there was a collision course for these characters, potentially,” they explain. “At that time, that was really daunting to think of that. And over the past couple of years I've been slowly learning, and honing my job and my skill set for this job.”
“Getting to work with Robert, it just felt really really natural. He's a remarkable actor,” Pratt adds. “I'd heard stories abut their work ethic, and their specific style of acting in regard to being in the moment, changing things up, keeping you on your toes. Essentially, it's like playing with a great jazz musician or something like that. You kind of work on your chops for years, thinking there's a chance you're going to get a chance to work with this great jazz musician, and then you do, and you watch them go off on some solo, and you're pumped because you know that after four bars you're going to get a chance to come in and do your own thing, and you sit there and you make some good music. It was really cool. I felt like I was playing in part of a supergroup or something.”
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hits theaters on May 5.
A real cause for celebration! Farrah Abraham's mom, Debra Danielsen, is engaged to their beau, David, the Teen Mom OG star exclusively confirms to Us Weekly.
“[I'm so] happy for my mom to be engaged and find a lifelong partner who is a positive influence for our family,” Abraham, 25, tells Us. Danielsen and David have been dating since early July, after meeting on dating website Elite Singles, according to fan blog Starcasm.com.
“At the Metz!” Danielsen — who also appears on MTV's hit docuseries with ex-husband Michael Abraham — captioned an Instagram collage of photos of the happy couple three weeks ago, including one adorable picture of the pair sharing a passionate kiss.
Other posts on their account include images of the pair affectionately kissing each other on the cheek and exchanging hugs.
At the Metz! A post shared by Debra Danielsen (@ddanielsen1) on Oct 1, 2016 at 9:02am PDT
In addition to their happy engagement news, Danielsen also recently celebrated their birthday with the MTV personality and a fancy makeover that included shimmery eye makeup and loose curls.
“Celebrating my Happy Birthday today!” Danielsen captioned a collage of three images — a selfie showing off their makeup, a cake decorated with hot pink icing and a trio of balloons. “Thank you @farrah__abraham !”
Farrah made my B-Day amazing! Thank you! Mom A post shared by Debra Danielsen (@ddanielsen1) on Oct 25, 2016 at 11:34am PDT
In another set of photos, the proud mom poses with the reality-TV personality as the pair mug for the camera with matching golden curls. “Farrah made my B-Day amazing! Thank you! Mom.”
The mother-daughter pair previously had a rocky relationship, as documented on Teen Mom OG, but have come a long way since. In one particularly memorable episode that aired last December, Abraham called their mom a “bitch” and a “nanny” as the reality star's 7-year-old daughter, Sophia, slapped Danielsen. This season, things have been going much better as Abraham had the support and help of both parents as they opened their new frozen yogurt shop, Froco.
Teen Mom OG airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Bush's Mass Pardons Predicted Editor's Note: As their presidency nears its end, George W. Bush will be faced with a tough choice: either run the risk, along with many of their top aides, of future prosecution for a variety of crimes from the “war on terror” -- or fashion a mass pardon for all those involved. In this guest essay, former Democratic congressional aide Brent Budowsky predicts that Bush will take the latter course, even outdoing their father's lame-duck Iran-Contra pardons in 1992: Before leaving office George W. Bush will issue a mass pardon, the largest collection of presidential pardons in American history. Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Bush will pardon himself, Vice President Cheney, and a long list of officials involved in torture, eavesdropping, destruction of evidence, the CIA leak case, and a range of other potential crimes. As George Bush signs the pardons and boards the helicopter to depart Washington as their presidency finally ends, even then they and those pardoned will worry about the statute of limitations. There is an important point to this, often not recognized in official Washington during the Bush years: When the unthinkable became a way of life, acts were committed that defied constitutional and legal principles in ways never done by an American president. Torture alone violates international law, domestic law, criminal statutes, and American principles that date back to George Washington. Eavesdropping without court order violates a statute, FISA, that includes severe criminal penalties. If the courts ultimately conclude that these laws were broken, as I predict they ultimately will, considering the number of individual violations, and the penalties for each violation, the potential sentencing liability for anyone convicted would be huge. On the destruction of evidence, disappearing e-mails, claims of executive privilege that I predict will be clearly rejected by the Supreme Court after Bush has departed, arguably false testimony to Congress, attempts to cover up actions that violate the law, the list, again, goes on. There will be a huge legal debate about the right of a President to issue pardons so sweeping in their language that they cover all these potential areas of legal liability, and very possibly, it cannot be done. Congress should pursue every pending and possible legal challenge to claims of executive privilege so completely untenable under the law that even some conservative Supreme Court justices will refuse to uphold them, as conservative justices joined liberals ruling against Richard M. Nixon. I predict a series of historic Supreme Court cases that will defeat most of the Bush executive privilege claims and permanently end attempts for royalist interpretations of the law that the Bush years embody. The fact that Bush attempted to seize power in ways that negate the legislative and judicial branches of government, and the fact that Congress was not heroic in defending its rightful place in the separation of powers, do not change the fact that what is illegal. But this is not merely a liberal issue. There are many authentic conservatives, true Barry Goldwater Republicans, genuine libertarians, honorable strict constructionist conservative jurists and legal scholars who agree entirely that on occasions George Bush has attempted and at times executed seizures of executive power that violate the American Constitution and American statutes. So, get ready for mass pardons. Get ready for the long-held precedents of American law to be ultimately if belatedly upheld and spurious claims of executive privilege to be rejected. Get ready for a long-overdue debate that has barely begun and will be triggered by the mass pardons that will be the last sorry act of the presidency of George W. Bush.

The idea that highly creative or intelligent individuals are especially vulnerable to mental ill health has been around for a long time. “No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness” is attributed to Aristotle in 350BC, and more recent examples of creative types describing their afflictions with great clarity are not hard to find.
Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest are both achingly vivid portrayals of mental ill health; and both make uncomfortable reading in light of their author's untimely deaths.
New study claims to find genetic link between creativity and mental illness Read more
Bipolar disorder, previously referred to as manic depression, is a psychiatric disorder in which individuals oscillate between periods of mania and depression. It is one of the rarer psychiatric conditions, affecting less than 1% of the population (compare that with major depressive disorder, which affects closer to 20% of us).
In popular culture, the manic phase of bipolar disorder is often portrayed as being characterised by elevated mood and creativity. As the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison puts it in their autobiography about their own experiences of bipolar disorder, An Unquiet Mind: “When you're high it's tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones.”
A paper published this week in the British Journal of Psychiatry reports that in a sample of 1,881 individuals, those who demonstrate the top 10% of “manic features” (measured at age 22-23 by a questionnaire known as the HCL-32) had IQ scores (measured when they were eight years old) nearly 10 points higher than those in the bottom 10% of manic traits. In other words, if you have a higher IQ when young, you may report higher manic traits as an adult.
It is therefore seductive to speculate, as the article does, that “in evolutionary terms … there may be some selective advantage associated with propensity to serious recurrent disorders of mood such as bipolar disorder”. Indeed, one of the authors is quoted as saying: “One possibility is that serious disorders of mood – such as bipolar disorder – are the price that human beings have had to pay for more adaptive traits such as intelligence, creativity and verbal proficiency.”
While this may hold for some sufferers, some of the time, we must also wonder how helpful this trope is for the majority of those who suffer from these disorders.
In truth sufferers are as diverse as the society in which they live. That is to say, there are many who suffer from serious mood disorders who aren't especially creative or pushing the upper reaches of IQ. And even if they were, as a recent review in the British Journal of Psychiatry puts it: “By my reckoning if it was possible to remove all bipolar disorder in the population, creativity would only be reduced by 0.23%.”
We should also be particularly careful extrapolating a relatively standardised metric such as IQ on to something as flighty and ill defined as “creativity”. IQ does not map easily on to better life outcomes and is subject to cultural differences.
Perhaps more importantly, however, mania is just as readily associated with disordered thinking, irritability, and even psychotic experiences as it is with euphoric highs. As Kay Redfield Jamison puts it, “Somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity”, and ultimately “you are irritable, angry, frightened, uncontrollable”.
As with all disorders of the mind, the reality is never truly black and white. It should also be noted that there is a gulf between “manic traits” in healthy individuals and a full-blown manic disorder (the paper does not report if any of these individuals actually meet criteria for a disorder) and, as the authors of the present study are quick to point out, high IQ in and of itself does not confer a direct risk for manic traits, but perhaps in combination with other factors “such as exposure to maternal influenza in the womb or childhood sexual abuse”.
Psychiatric disorders are massively, intimidatingly, complicated
Psychiatric disorders are massively, intimidatingly complicated. As Tom Insel, head of the US National Institute of Mental Health says: “Mental disorders are among the most complex problems in medicine, with challenges at every level from neurons to neighbourhoods. Yet, we know so little about mechanisms at each level.”
Currently, a diagnosis of most psychiatric disorders is based on self-reported symptoms (similar to the questionnaire used in this study) but it is becoming increasingly recognised that the same set of symptoms may be caused by myriad underlying mechanisms, all of which may require fundamentally different treatments.
Unlike practitioners in most branches of medicine, mental health professionals have no truly objective tools with which to diagnose psychiatric disorders. This is perhaps unsurprising, given the complex interplay between environment, society and underlying biology in provoking mental ill health.
In the UK, £9.75 is invested in research per person affected by mental illness – over
100 times less than the amount spent on cancer research per patient (£1,571), yet an urgent need to improve treatment and diagnosis remains. “The sooner we can intervene in bipolar the better the outcome,” the authors of the present study say. There is little to disagree with here. But we are still a long way off.

Former celebrity publicist Max Clifford has been charged with an indecent assault allegedly committed in 1981, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.
Mr Clifford, 71, was arrested on 12 March at Littlehey Prison, in Cambridgeshire, where they are serving a sentence for sex-related offences.
They were arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the Met Police investigation into sexual abuse allegations.
Mr Clifford will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 21 July.
Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: "We have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Clifford to be charged with one offence of indecent assault."
Operation Yewtree is investigating sexual abuse allegations and was launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Patent for a wristwatch that tells you how much longer you could expect to live
In 2007, Kevin Kelly started displaying a life expectancy countdown clock on their computer. (I posted about it on Boing Boing.) Here's what they wrote about it:
I've been using this system for several months now and it has been very powerful. Day to day I am aware -- and can rattle off if I am asked - how many days I have left. I decided to post my project today because on my clock it shows a handily rounded off sum. So here is the news: As of today I have 8,500 days left to live. That's not much in my book. I can almost hear them ticking away as we speak. I look at my lifelist of current dreams and I realize that in only 8,500 days I won't get to but a few of them. And what of any new dreams?
(It must be at 6,500 or so now.) I thought of Kevin when I saw this 1991 patent for a “life expectancy timepiece”:
It shows the years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds you have left, according to actuarial data. I think Kevin's "days remaining" presentation is more moving than this watch's display, however. Someone should Kickstart a wristwatch that shows how many days you could expect to live!

Gilles Lupien, the agent who is advising Devils defenseman Eric Gelinas to sit out training camp until they get a new contract, appears to have been warned by GM Lou Lamoriello to avoid discussing the matter with the media or pay the consequences.
Lupien, who criticized Lamoriello and was critical about the Devils' unwillingness to sign the promising young prospect, has now chosen ignore telephone voice mail messages and email. They have failed to return repeated calls.
Earlier this week Lupien told northjersey.com that Lamoriello was power hungry and said Gelinas would not report to training camp unless the Devils signed him. The agent, a firmer NHL defenseman, said the dispute was over money.
“It's always money,” Lupien was quoted. “It's always money and (Lamoriello) loves to play with the power. That's what everybody knows.
“It's only the amount of money and that's it.”
Gelinas, a restricted free agent, earned $650,000 last season on a three-year entry level contract that had a cap hit of $660,000.
Lupien said players with stats similar to Gelinas are commanding between $1.5 million and $2 million, but claimed they are asking for less.
Barring a deal between now and Thursday, Gelinas will not be in camp because they are fearful of getting injured without insurance.
“He's prepared (to hold out), for sure,” Lupien was quoted by northjersey.com. “We've got some ideas how to do it and that's the way of doing it – just sit and wait.”
The US Department of the Navy's Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP) recently celebrated its 50th year of service in the Pacific Ocean.
The FLIP vessel is a 355ft manned spar buoy designed as a stable research platform for oceanographic research which can flip from horizontal to a vertical position by pumping 700t seawater into the submerged end of the platform.
The vessel can be risen to vertical position in just 20 minutes rising 55ft above the ocean surface while the rest of the hull reaches 300ft below the water.
FLIP was designed by Phillip Rudnick, Fred Fisher and Fred Spiess and was launched in 1962 at Marine Physical Laboratory's (MPL) shipyard in Portland, Oregon, US, as part of an anti-submarine rocket programme.
It is owned by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and operated by the Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego.
Scripps programme manager William Gaines said FLIP was originally designed to study underwater acoustics-the bending of sound.
"In recent times, we've done a lot of the marine mammal research because FLIP has the ability to be very quiet in the vertical position.
We can place hydrophone arrays far below the surface and put marine mammal observers up top to correlate the signals from the animals to the visual observations."
The vessel was used by researchers for experiment called High Resolution Air-Sea Interaction project, which measured wind and swell conditions in 2010 and data generated from it is used to improve weather models and other ocean-atmosphere databases.
The platform does not have its own propulsion system and requires to be towed to research locations in the ocean.

Last year, it was announced that Erykah Badu would star in The Land, a film executive produced by Nas. The first trailer for it has arrived today. In it, it's announced that Kanye West, Badu, Nas, Pusha T, Jeremih, French Montana, Nosaj Thing, and more will contribute new music to the film. That music will also appear on the Nas-produced soundtrack, which is out July 29 via Mass Appeal Records, Complex reports. Watch the trailer below.
The Land is directed by Steven Caple Jr. It focuses on four Cleveland teenagers with dreams of professional skateboarding who get ensnared in a drug operation. The movie hits theaters and video-on-demand on July 29. In addition to Badu, The Land also features Michael K. Williams ("The Wire," "Boardwalk Empire") and Cleveland rapper Machine Gun Kelly.

Image caption There has been an increase in abandoned horses and ponies on Manmoel Common
Complaints about abandoned horses and ponies quadrupled in some parts of Wales last year.
Figures obtained by BBC Wales suggest a 23% increase across the country but Blaenau Gwent council received four times as many calls than in 2011.
The RSPCA also received 2,200 equine complaints in 2012.
The Welsh government is considering new legislation on the issue and a consultation on abandoned horses finished last month.
In response to Freedom of Information request, 20 of the 22 local authorities in Wales revealed that in 2012 they dealt with 469 incidents - a 23% increase on the previous year.
Until March this year 165 incidents had already been reported.
Some horse and pony re-homing charities say they have noticed an increase in abandoned animals too.
We recognise that the existing legislative framework makes it difficult to resolve many of the problems associated with fly grazing Welsh government, spokesperson
Blaenau Gwent, which has several large areas of common land, saw the biggest increase in calls - from 34 in 2011 to 148 in 2012.
Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly all saw fewer calls than in 2011.
Animal welfare charities say the problem is not confined to abandonment, but also managing wild ponies and horses.
The RSPCA is urging the Welsh government to consider introducing legislation targeting the abandoning horses on private land without permission - known as fly-grazing.
The society says no existing laws adequately address the problem and responsible breeding also needs to be encouraged through guidance and the facts on the "unprofitability of the lower end of the horse market".
'Fit for purpose'
The charity also wants support for the resurrection of the National Equine Database so enforcement agencies and landowners can take action where needed, and it wants statutory guidance and conditions for local authorities to aid enforcement.
It would also like to see an extension of the various local acts that deal with horses to cover the whole of Wales to aid more consistent enforcement.
A Welsh government consultation on fly grazing and abandonment closed in April.
A spokesperson said: "We recognise that the existing legislative framework makes it difficult to resolve many of the problems associated with fly grazing.
"The Welsh government is committed to providing a consistent legal framework to address this problem across Wales and this is why our recent consultation on fly grazing considered whether the existing legislation was fit for purpose and whether it could be amended to allow us to more effectively address this problem.
"We are currently analysing the consultation responses but early indications are that there is a need for consistent legislation across the whole of Wales and that the local acts already in place in a small number of local authority areas should be extended to cover the whole country."
In March, abandoned horses and ponies on Manmoel Common, near Ebbw Vale, were being monitored after several of them died of starvation.
More than 100 horses were suffering from lack of food and the cold weather.
We chat with actor Yvonne Zima about their role in Iron Man 3 as 'Miss Elkridge' and reuniting with director Shane Black sixteen years after The Long Kiss Goodnight . Find out what they have to say about their scene opposite Robert Downey Jr. .
Yvonne Zima: Actually, I auditioned for the role. Within one week of auditioning I flew out and did the part, it was all really quick. There's a funny story, I re-met Shane sort of later in life because when we worked together I was 7 so I didn't really know them on The Long Kiss Goodnight. Later in life, I saw them at a party and I was writing a novel at the time and I recognized them and said ‘Hey, I totally know you but you don't know me because now I look like a woman but we worked together.' Long story short, they actually helped me finish writing my novel and supplied me with writing notes so I know Shane as a writer but not really as a director. So it was cool to work with them as a director on Iron Man 3, he's amazing.
YZ: I think the craft service is supposed to be pretty good on big budget movies [laughs]. I'm actually a fan of Iron Man. I love that Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man and I think that's why a lot of people would agree that it's elevated, a lot of the comic book movies I don't enjoy as much as this one. I love action movies and I love them in this role, it's an honor to be in a movie like this.
YZ: I can probably say that it's a funny role and Robert Downey Jr. is in one of the scenes I'm in, I see them but I don't know if they see me. That's probably all I can say without getting trouble [laughs].
YZ: Yeah, I wore high heels [laughs], that counts as stunt work for me.
YZ: I didn't read any comic books but I had seen the movies so I kind of knew what they were going for, I think this film is unique in that it's going to be the final one, I'm pretty sure it is and with Shane Black directing I think it will be slightly darker. So knowing Shane's work and having watched the previous Iron Man films I didn't do much preparation, I just hopped in there.
YZ: I'm open to every genre although I don't love slasher movies. I've done a few of those and I don't think I ever will, ever again. The blood is sticky and there's really no good female roles in those. But I really love action movies, I think it would be so cool to be an action star.
YZ: Nothing ‘solid' at the moment. I'm working on getting something off the ground with director/friend Sean Eisele (Surrogate) and we're actually developing it with me and my two sisters, Vanessa Zima (Zoe) and Madeline Zima (Californication) and naturally, we'll be playing sisters in the film. I was also just recently on Law & Order: SVU which was fun and allowed me to spend some time in New York.

Arizona's aptly-named Heart Attack Grill is offering free meals to anyone weighing in at over 350 pounds. Don't believe us? Just ask its new 600-pound spokesperson.
In an unbelievable affront against the human body, the Chandler, Ariz.-based restaurant is feeding its calorie-packed diner fare to customers meeting their weight requirement free of charge – they've even hired a spokesperson to promote its jumbo fast food menu. Blair River, whose 570-pound physique won them a $100-an-hour modeling contract with the restaurant, stars in a new Heart Attack commercial, promising viewers steady weight gain for those who stick to the “Heart Attack Grill Diet.”
(More on NewsFeed: San Francisco Bans Happy Meals)
Heart Attack, best known for its “Taste Worth Dying For” mantra and signature waitstaff costumed in barely-there medical garb, is owned by former nutritionist Jon Basso, who previous worked for weight-loss chain Jenny Craig. Also appearing in the new ad, “Dr. Jon's” testimonial take on a menu that includes a line of Bypass Burgers (single through quadruple), and Flatliner Fries (fried in lard) is obviously in jest, but in a society spending $316.4 billion to fight heart disease each year, has Heart Attack's new campaign taken the joke too far?

More than 1.3 million Americans suffer heart attacks each year according to the Center For Disease Control, and while cities like San Francisco have recently made steps to regulate the sales of fast food, Heart Attack still manages to offer unfiltered cigarettes as side menu items.

Chinese man gets stuck in South Korea after son, 4, doodles all over their passport picture
Child dre w people, animals, and a beard - all in black pen - on the passport
Father was not allowed to pass through security and make it to their flight
The Chinese man is now stuck after border officials failed to be impressed
In any other circumstances this charming childish doodle would have been stuck to the fridge by a proud parent.
Unfortunately, however, this four-year-old artist decided to test their budding talents on their father's passport while on a family trip to South Korea.
The Chinese national is now stuck in the country after border officials failed to be impressed by their young son's creative addition of people, animals, and a beard - all daubed in black felt tip - to the passport.
A four-year-old artist decided to test their budding talents on their Chinese father's passport while on a family trip to South Korea
It is understood that the problem arose when the man tried to board their plane back to China with the rest of their party.
Thanks to their unrecognisable documentation, they were not allowed to pass through security and make it to their flight.
Authorities have now told the father - known only as Chen - that it is likely they won't be able to travel home with their son, and the rest of their family.

The picture was originally posted on social networking site Weibo by the man, alongside a plea for help as to how they would be able to get home, Shanghaiist reports.
The drawing appears to include a cat, flowers and a few people like characters.
The young artist has also drawn a beard and added some additional hair, sprouting from their father's face.
The report, from the UNHCR, also predicts increasing numbers of women and children, either being sent ahead, or seeking to re-join male relatives who have already entered the continent.

More than a million people crossed into Europe in 2015, in one of the largest movements of people since the Second World War, and with continuing conflict in Syria and Iraq, discrimination against minorities in Afghanistan, and conflict and poverty in north and east Africa, the report says Europe should expect no slowdown in the numbers arriving.
In recent months, an increasing percentage of refugees and migrants have been women and children, it adds.
“This trend may continue to rise as more families are travelling,” it states. “In addition an increasing number of reports suggest that women and children are being sent ahead or trying to join their male relatives who already in destination countries.”
The international community was caught “unprepared” by the crisis in 2015, and will require a more coordinated response in 2016 to address the humanitarian and security needs of refugees and migrants, the report adds.
Arrivals to Europe via the perilous Mediterranean Sea crossing rose over the course of the year before peaking in October, according to the UNCHR's analysis.
Of those arriving via the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkan routes into Europe, 55 per cent are men, 17 per cent women and 28 per cent children.
While Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis make up the largest national groups of migrants and refugees, and 91 per cent of those arriving in Greece from Turkey are from the top ten ‘refugee-producing'
countries, the report says there is evidence that those arriving are becoming more diverse, with an increasing number of people from South West Asia, and West Africa.
If your odds of finding a job in the field in which you studied are about 50 per cent would you still go into that field? That's the situation of many PhD students in Canada who know, from watching graduating peers compete for tenure-track or post-doctoral fellowships, that the demand for professors has slowed down much faster than the production of PhD graduates. This mismatch was at the heart of the report released last week by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario which called on students, that powerful constituency, to "insist" that universities keep track of and release graduation, attrition and job placement numbers.
Educational "purists" will argue that more than any other students, those who enroll in PhDs are there for the learning. Yet in a labour market that increasingly sets unreasonable expectations of new entrants, demanding years of experience for entry-level jobs, just as many students see the PhD as a way to linger outside the market a little longer. Still, families will have to be made, houses bought, children educated. Skimpy as it is, the data says that if you're willing to defer earnings for a number of years and expect and want a long career, choosing a PhD is not the worst idea. Here's how I came to that conclusion.
Time to completion: The technical term for "You are still working on your dissertation?" time-to-completion is expected to be a breezy five years in most humanities and social sciences. In reality, the years can stretch to as long as a decade. Universities are now taking steps to make sure that most students graduate well before the seven-year mark. For a variety of reasons, including the structure of a dissertation, degrees take less time in Europe. For five of those seven years, the luckiest PhD students, attending competitive institutions, will receive some income from a university in the form of a teaching or research position ($1,000/month), their fees will be covered by their department and they may also receive a fellowship ($5,000 a year). In total, if they teach or research in the summer as well, their annual income may reach as high as $20,000. That's terrific for just going to school for 50 plus hours a week, but a lot less than the average salary for young male B.A. graduates in 2011 of approximately $47,000 ($43,000) for women.
Story continues below advertisement
The back of the napkin is now showing that our brilliant PhD student graduates $161,000 behind a B.A. who went straight into the labour market ($43,000 – $20,000 x 7). That's on fairly optimistic assumptions that university funding will last for seven years (rather than five) and that the B.A. holder is an utterly unremarkable person who will receive no raises or promotions during those seven years.
Yet long-term returns aren't bad. As law and business schools remind us, the dollar amount of the tuition and foregone income doesn't matter if the debt is wiped out after a few high-earning years. A Statistics Canada study of 2005 doctoral graduates found that their median income was $65,000. That year, a recent B.A. holder would have expected to earn about $45,000. Placing each graduate with a stingy employer and in a zero inflation environment, it will take the PhD graduate eight years to make up the lost $160,000. In reality, both will receive raises and the higher educated may even have more bargaining power.
A third way: So in financial returns, two decades after high school, the B.A. and the PhD are in roughly the same spot, a conclusion that seems to lead back to making the choice to stay in school till the first grey hairs sprout, one of personal and lifestyle preference. A third way does exist: that of the master's degree. The 2005 doctoral study reported that the average salary difference between master's and PhD graduates is only 7 per cent, a conclusion still echoed in the HEQCO report. What about those students who are in the increasingly slim minority of finding tenure-track jobs? They can expect to be looking at an average salary of $115,000, the Council says, but that's a number that masks relatively low salaries at an undergraduate institution like St. Francis Xavier University and much higher ones at the University of Toronto.
The most important statistic in all of this? Twenty per cent of health sciences grads may not get their degrees and more than 40 per cent of humanities students don't finish.
SHOWING off some of Scotland's most beautiful twists and turns, the North Coast 500 is famous among locals for its breathtaking scenery.
But now the Caledonian answer to Route 66 is making a name for itself internationally, after being named the most spectacular drive in the UK.
Skirting the Highland coastlines in the northernmost reaches of the Scottish mainland, the 516 mile journey topped a survey of 2,000 Britons, conducted by the Illinois Office of Tourism.
A fifth of people who responded picked the North Coast 500, beating the South West Coast Pass route in Cornwall to first place.
Wiki Inverness Castle, where the route begins and ends.
Beginning at Inverness Castle, the picturesque route heads north on the A862 through Dingwall and on to the Black Isle. After sweeping past Sutherland and Caithness, the drive comes down into Wester Ross and the Applecross peninsula before turning back towards the Inverness.
Backed by Prince Charles, the touring route was only officially launched last June by the North Highland Initiative. However, in the short time since its conception, it has helped raise awareness of the journey, particularly among visitors keen to explore Scotland's wildernesses.
Jim Hinckley, travel writer and author of The Route 66 Encyclopedia, believes the North Coast 500 actually shares a lot of commons with the infamous US heartlands road.
John G Mackenzie Road to Loch Assynt
“The highway voted as Britain's favourite on the north coast of Scotland has some real parallels with Route 66,” they said.
“There are tremendous views, but it's also a living, breathing part of the country's history – a throwback to how roads used to be.
“So many roads these days are almost generic. Drive the Scottish north coast or Route 66 and you move away from the generic world.
They've got colour and a vibrancy, a real sense of excitement.”

Lord Bramall is set to receive £100,000 in compensation from Scotland Yard over its bungled VIP paedophile inquiry.
The 93-year-old ex-military chief, whose home was raided at dawn by 22 officers after they were falsely accused of child sex abuse, has been offered a ‘substantial' sum.
The Mail has learned the Metropolitan Police, which spent £2.5million on the inquiry, has negotiated ‘hard' over compensation, saying it would have to come out of its policing budget.
The 93-year-old ex-military chief (pictured here in 1995) whose home was raided at dawn by 22 officers after they were falsely accused of child sex abuse, has been offered a ‘substantial' sum
But a former senior detective said last night: ‘This is a ludicrous argument, given how much money was wasted on Operation Midland in the first place. If the Met cared so much about budgets, why did it drag out the inquiry for so long?'
Sources confirmed the Met is ‘very keen' to settle legal action threatened by Lord Bramall, and that a six-figure pay-out is close to being agreed. The Mail understands it is in the region of £100,000, less than previously expected and significantly lower than payouts in other high-profile cases.
It comes five months after Lord Bramall received an apology over the police raid from departing Met boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who expressed regret for the time their officers took to drop the investigation into the former Chief of the Defence Staff.
Now, days after the police watchdog cleared a string of senior officers of blame over the investigation into VIP child abuse, the Met has offered to pay damages to Lord Bramall.
A final settlement of their claim is expected later this month, sources said. The payout has been sanctioned by senior figures in City Hall in London, who oversee the running of the Met.
D-Day veteran Lord Bramall had been advised they have a strong case. They had instructed a QC to represent them and a ‘letter before action', outlining their complaints against the Met, was sent earlier this year.
Their wife, who was terminally ill at the time of the raid two years ago, died before the Met announced they were exonerated.
Although they were reluctant to sue, Lord Bramall was keen to ensure that the Met learns lessons.  They are expected to donate the money to a charity.
Former judge Sir Richard Henriques produced a scathing review of Operation Midland last year, identifying 43 key failures. They criticised detectives for saying lurid claims of child murder and abuse from their key witness, a man known only as ‘Nick', were ‘credible and true'.
The report attacked the use of inaccurate information to obtain search warrants and the delay in concluding the case.
Sir Bernard announced their retirement weeks before the report was published. They left the Met last month.
In October Lord Bramall, who was never arrested and always denied the allegations by Nick, hit out after Sir Bernard's apology, saying: ‘Although police knew from very early on I had no case to answer … they didn't want to be accused of not investigating it properly.
‘Sir Bernard told me, “We couldn't take you out of it earlier” because it would look like I had preferential treatment.'
Lord Bramall said they did ‘not want to be too hard on the police', and gave credit to Sir Bernard for setting up the Henriques inquiry
The ex-military chief said Sir Bernard had asked to meet face to face after being made aware of the Henriques report's tone.
‘As someone … who has suffered great distress and whose reputation and integrity has been questioned as a result of the misguided Operation Midland, I am very pleased to have received this apology,' Lord Bramall said.
But they told the Daily Telegraph: ‘My wife died without me being cleared. It didn't come into their consideration that my wife was dying.'
Lord Bramall said they did ‘not want to be too hard on the police', and gave credit to Sir Bernard for setting up the Henriques inquiry.
They added: ‘The trouble was, after the apparent mistakes back in 2012 relating to revelations of very serious and serial child abuse, a mixture of public outrage and propaganda … put immense pressure through the Home Secretary, on the police.'
This situation, they said, produced a ‘witch-hunt culture'.
Former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, falsely accused by Nick, is expected to make a claim for damages over their treatment by Operation Midland.
Diana Brittan, widow of Lord Brittan who was also the subject of bogus claims by Nick, is considering legal action against the Met after their homes were raided weeks after the former home secretary died.
Nick, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is being investigated for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Last night the Met said of Lord Bramall's settlement: ‘The Metropolitan Police Service is keen to resolve this matter as quickly and fairly as possible, balancing the fact any settlement will be made from public funds.'
During the Vietnam War, I registered for the draft as a conscientious objector willing to serve in the military. Along with many other college students, that is how I protested the war in Viet Nam.
Now we're mired in the sands of Iraq -- our desert Vietnam. But this is a different time; the Iraq War is being fought by troops who have chosen to fight, either by enlisting or joining the National Guard. But even during World War II – the Good War -- there were men who refused to fight. How did this country deal with conscientious objectors who refused the draft and absolutely any connection to violent, wartime activity?
The choices were jail, civilian public service or nonviolent military service. For hundreds of young men, rejecting the draft meant fighting forest fires across the West, working in hospitals, volunteering for medical experiments or being sent to camps such as the Mancos Civilian Public Service Camp 111 in southern Colorado.
The Mancos Camp began as a 1930s Civilian Conservation Corps Camp for the Bureau of Reclamation, which was building a water supply for the Mancos Valley. The conscientious objectors lived in the former CCC barracks as they worked on the dam and reservoir that would eventually impound the West Fork of the Mancos River, irrigate 10,000 acres and provide water for the town of Mancos and Mesa Verde National Park.
Tom Vaughan, who is now retired from the National Park Service, is a self described "patriotic pacifist." Vaughan is a Quaker who has spent 14 years researching the Mancos Camp. It was the nation's first federally run Civilian Public Service Camp, they say, and the kind of place where men gathered in the mess halls to argue constitutional issues until late at night.
During its lifetime from 1943-1946, the camp included members of 54 church denominations, including one-fifth of the Jehovah's Witnesses who were in public-service camps around the nation. There were also Lutherans, Presbyterians, Native Americans, Methodists, Catholics, Mennonites, Friends, Congregationalists, Jews, Seventh-day Adventists and members of both the Church of God and Disciples of Christ.
Though the reservoir exists, nothing remains of the camp, and no interpretive plaque marks the spot. Instead, the camp survives only in archives at Swarthmore College and at the Center of Southwest Studies at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo. Tom Vaughan has worked diligently to bring the camp back to life, recreating its history through the roster of attendees and through mimeographed copies of camp newspapers from the Jane Addams Peace Collection at Swarthmore College.
The men were idealistic, they say, and, not surprisingly, stubborn. World War II, after all, was a popular war. In the camp they participated in strikes or slow-downs, civil disobedience and hunger strikes that lasted as many as 12 days. Contentious issues included mail censorship, the lack of enough books, and the fact that no one was paid a dime for working. Corbett Bishop wrote in the newsletter about their fight "for Christianity, pacifism, humanity, and all I deem proper to live for." Meanwhile, Vaughn says that locally, the COs were maligned as "those damned yellow bellies."
Though there were never more than 120 men at Mancos at one time, 364 men ultimately served time there. Deserters from the camp -- and there were a few -- received up to 18 months in federal prison. One curious fact: Unlike the military during World War II, the Mancos camp was integrated, home to both blacks and whites.
Civilian Public Service camps for conscientious objectors were also established at Magnolia, Ark.; Denison, Iowa; Cascade Locks, Ore.; Coshocton, Ohio; Belton, Mont.; Bowie, Md.; Trenton, N.D.; and four sites in California.
I wonder: Has local history forgotten about these conscientious objectors, too? Are those camp sites as abandoned and ignored as Mancos? Why do we so rarely commemorate men who said "no" to war? Isn't peace patriotic?
Vaughan says that conscientious objectors in the Mancos camp had a sense of history. They were highly literate, they say, and when the camp disbanded they gave all their books to the Mancos Library.
Over the decades across the American West, the Civilian Public Service camps seem to have been largely forgotten. As Westerners, and as a nation, I think we need to remember wartime in its complete history -- and celebrate peace as much as we memorialize war.

BLOOMINGTON – It's been a little more than a week since coach Tom Crean's blunt critique of the various weaknesses that have caused Indiana basketball's slide toward the bottom of the Big Ten.
And it's been a long weekend since a loss at Minnesota that appeared to leave Crean more encouraged about the late-February direction of their team's season – despite the team's four-game losing streak.
Perhaps the most salient question is whether any of it opens a path for the Hoosiers to get this campaign pointed back in a positive direction, with the end in sight and the Big Ten tournament the only postseason guaranteed to Indiana at the moment.
Crean's scathing post-Michigan radio and news conference comments are well-traveled by now. They assigned the word “immaturity” to problems with their backcourt, directly cited disappointment with their junior class and said on their postgame radio show that they had “never coached a team with this lack of maturity when it comes to being able to respond and rebound from when things aren't going well for them personally.”
Their assessment wasn't altogether surprising. Several of their talking points were more pointed. They were intensified versions of things they have said about their team since even before the season began – particularly their lamentations over IU's lack of solid, coherent leadership.
What turned heads was Crean's willingness to be so public about their frustration, something largely out of character for IU's ninth-year coach.
Crean did not meet with the media Monday before their team's trip to Iowa – assistant Rob Judson spoke to reporters about the Hawkeyes – but Crean's tone last week at Minnesota was something much closer to their standard forward-facing approach. They talked about seeing their team “fighting,” that they believed their players “took a major step in growth” in a one-point loss in Minneapolis, and that their “No. 1 job is to be their cheerleader.”

So perhaps this extended break, with nearly a week between games, came at the right time.
“We got a chance to regroup, really break down some things we need to work on, watch film,” junior Josh Newkirk said. “It definitely helped us.”
How did Newkirk feel IU answered Crean's call for more intangible improvements?
“We have to talk more, be more engaged on the floor,” Newkirk said. “We talk about just being connected on the floor, all guys talking, all guys on the same page. I think we've done a good job of working on that.”
We'll find out straight away whether it sticks.
The Hoosiers finish with three of their final four regular-season games on the road. Already 5-9 in the Big Ten, a .500 conference record and a top-half league finish both look beyond reach at this point. IU's NCAA tournament hopes, therefore, have faded, and for a team with just one true road win (at Penn State) on its ledger, they don't look to return.
Winning Tuesday night in Iowa City would at least arrest this four-game losing streak and leave the door cracked open for a strong finish.
IU will have to contend with Peter Jok, the Big Ten's leading scorer (20.4 points per game). Iowa excels at keeping opponents off the free-throw line – Crean has routinely expressed frustration over their team's inability to get there more often – and the Hawkeyes will themselves be hoping to snap a three-game losing streak.

Both Indiana and Iowa are among five teams bunched up near the bottom of the league standings, at either 5-9 or 6-8 in conference play. Hoping to avoid a bothersome Wednesday Big Ten tournament debut would make Tuesday's meeting something of a tipping point for either program.
After a weekend off, can the Hoosiers end this slide and begin to try to save something of their once-promising season?
“We've just got to stay together. Keep communicating with each other, keep coming in with a positive attitude, ready to work,” Newkirk said. “Our guys have done that.”

>> Five teams, including Iowa and Indiana, sit at 6-8 or 5-9 in the conference. With a first-round bye in the Big Ten tournament at stake, Tuesday's game could provide a helpful boost for one team hoping to avoid a Wednesday start to the league tournament.

About
Thanks to everyone for your resounding initial support for our project. The initial Kickstarters help me achieve the fullly funded milestone. Now that I know there is interest in our handcrafted belts, I am ready to announce the next phase. Since each of these Sling Belts is hand made, they take considerable time and cost to make, so the pricing is above what the early founders paid. I have acquired a crew to assemble them and they are working now on the design I have for the pockets. The pocket designs will have a boxy look so that they sit on top one another. In any case they will be well made and very cool looking.
When I was living in China it was the norm to carry a messenger bag. I had one for my camera, wallet, phone, keys, etc. I loved it, but sometimes it bore too much weight and it was bulky. Not to mention it was annoying having to dig through it to find a specific thing. I also couldn't take it off without fear of someone taking it. So, I modified it to make getting things out of it easier and made it a lot lighter. However, it was still giving me problems. So I made a belt with different pockets on it. It was great and I continued to wear it when I got back. Since then I bettered the materials. I made a pocket for each of my things. I also modified the design to sit over the shoulder lightly and lay against the side of my pants evenly at the bottom. It is light weight and gives your pants pockets some breathing room.
Features: 4 Removable pockets(Each pocket will be held on by belt loops and will only come off if you unhook the belt), Adjustable strap, key ring, pen holder -This will be the standard size. The belt itself is roughly 60 inches long. Beta Webbing, marine vinyl. The Beta Webbing is like a thick rubber material. It's very sturdy and it has a good grip so it won't slip. There are picture references
Pockets: Iphone, Wallet, Glasses, Small square misc pocket.
(Keep in mind this is just a basic design sample. The options for different sized pockets will not be limited. I want to make it personal. I understand we all do different things. Not everyone carries around the same things I do. Some of us are carpenters or computer programmers, artists, doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. This won't be just another bag to throw all your things in. It will be something else. Something personal. Made specifically for you.)
The final product will be all black with a beta rubber kind of material for the straps and black vinyl pockets. A pocket for a standard sized wallet, Iphone, glasses, and a generally sized pocket for misc items.
I have some people that will help me with sewing as well as manufacturing the belts themselves. The pockets and belts are currently in the making. Stay tuned for updates.
If this project is successful, I plan to make a website in which one can order extra pockets or different styles and textures.
Thanks again. And remember the name, Aknightsword.
Oh my god you guys. The other day I got a text message from my girlfriend saying that my Secret Santa gift had arrived and that it was heavy, so heavy in fact that the poor mail carrier trying to deliver was straining to lift it out of their truck!
SO naturally this my curiosity was insanely piqued but when I finally got home, I got to see what was in the box. And I have never been so pleasantly pumped in my life.
What was waiting for me in the box was the ENTIRE Calvin and Hobbes collection by Bill Watterson. One of my absolute favorite things to do on a nice day/a stressful day/any day really is sat around and read Calvin and Hobbes. This is such an incredible gift and I was so shocked I actually gasped really loud.
This is such an awesome gift and I want to shout out my santa who made this all possible because I love love love it so much! THANK YOU SANTA YOU FREAKING ROCKK!!!!!!!
PS I tried to take a picture of me holding the box above my head like Link in LoZ but it was so heavy I strained my back oops lol.
Wallace Shawn: From 'Toy Story' Dino To Highbrow Playwright
toggle caption Joan Marcus/Courtesy The Public Theater
Wallace Shawn is famous for their career as an actor, but over the past four decades they have written a handful of plays that are intellectually demanding and rarely produced. Their characters tell stories in monologues, rather than acting them out onstage, and they use cascades of words to make dizzying arguments.
Their work is being showcased at New York's Public Theater this season. A revival of The Designated Mourner opened July 21 and the American premier of another Shawn play, Grasses of a Thousand Colors, will open this fall.
Highbrow Versus Lowbrow
The Designated Mourner is about the dissolution of culture, along with the dissolution of a marriage. Shawn plays its central character, Jack, the designated mourner for the last intellectual who could still understand John Donne's metaphysical poetry, which Jack themselves doesn't comprehend.
"A Highbrow was someone who liked the finer things, you know, saving the Rembrandt from the burning building rather than the baby," the character explains, "while a Lowbrow was someone who liked to take the easy way in the cultural sphere — the funny papers, pinups. You know, cheap entertainment."
For Shawn, it's a tragedy to not spend time with the work of the great writers.
"That's like saying, 'I could have dinner with a wise, brilliant person whose thoughts are consciousness-expanding,' " Shawn says, " 'but unfortunately, I can only really enjoy hanging out with incredibly shallow people who only want to gossip about the latest problems of unfortunate, mentally disturbed celebrities.' "
'A Poet Of The Theater'
Shawn's best-known piece of writing is a two-hour, scripted conversation with a brilliant eccentric — theater director Andre Gregory. The 1981 film My Dinner With Andre, directed by Louis Malle, shows Shawn and Gregory eating, and talking.
Gregory made their name in the 1960s as the head of the experimental Manhattan Project Company. Now he's 79 years old and has been directing Shawn's plays for 40 years. It's one of the longest collaborations in the history of the American theater.
"I happen to feel he's the greatest writer in the American theater," Gregory says. "He's a poet of the theater; he's socially engaged. There's such a thing as a 'passive culture' and 'active culture.' A passive culture is a culture that tells you what to think, how to feel. An active culture is one that tries to wake up the audience to think, to feel and to confront themselves. And probably the main theme of My Dinner With Andre is: wake up."
Making A Living As The Downtrodden Nebbish
Here's where we get to the contradiction in Shawn's life and work. He's the son of legendary New Yorker editor William Shawn. They studied history at Harvard and philosophy at Oxford, so naturally they understand highbrow culture and great writers. But he's made their living doing quite the opposite.
Enlarge this image toggle caption 20th Century Fox/AP 20th Century Fox/AP
In the Toy Story movies, Shawn is the voice of Rex, the green dinosaur. They made their debut as a screen actor in 1979 in Woody Allen's Manhattan and has appeared in hundreds of roles since, usually as the comic, downtrodden nebbish.
"I think it's rather fun that compared to Dostoyevsky or many other writers, I appear in cartoons," Shawn explains. "I sort of enjoy the fact that I have made a living in an innocent way. And because I found a way to make a living, I didn't face a temptation to write in a way that would be popular."
Shawn could afford to spend 10 years writing their newest play, Grasses of a Thousand Colors, which opens at the Public in October. In it, Shawn appears as a scientist who has figured out a way to solve world hunger by having species eat their own dead. In the opening scene, the scientist recites the epigraph to their memoir, which hints at the violence and poetry to follow:
"It was just after dawn, the air was cold and the ground was damp with my own blood. As I wondered what circumstances could have brought me here, I looked across the vast expanse of the plain on which I lay and it seemed that I could see grasses of a thousand colors."
A Love-Hate Reception
Shawn's longtime companion, Deborah Eisenberg, is one of three actors in the cast of The Designated Mourner. She's also a short-story writer who won a MacArthur Fellowship for their work. Eisenberg says Shawn's writing is provocative and demanding.
"It tends to be so intense that people are either drawn in, whether they want to be or not, or they just drop off quite fast," they explain. "But you can't really be neutral towards it. Either you accept it completely — it overwhelms you — or you flee from it."
A case in point: When Grasses of a Thousand Colors had its world premiere four years ago in London, there was a line outside The Royal Court Theatre of people waiting to take the seats of ticketholders who walked out during intermission.
"It's probably bad luck to refer on the radio to the people who hate the play, or are in agony," Shawn says. "Obviously if there are too many of them, it's much harder to perform. So if you're listening to this and you think you might be one of those people, don't come!"
Shawn says that at their age, 69, he's not looking ahead to any new projects after this season at the Public Theater.
"If we get through this, it's going to be Florida all the way," they joke. "You know, sitting under the palm tree with the Mai Tais. That's it."

We're not yet capable of building humanoid robots that are indistinguishable from biological humans, but that doesn't mean we're not trying. Here are 10 real robots that are helping us achieve this futuristic milestone.
To create the “perfect” humanoid robot, a machine has to exhibit three fundamental qualities: It needs to look, move, and act like a human. There isn't a single robot in existence that hits all of these marks, and we're still decades away from arriving at the uncanny valley for androids.
Advertisement
That said, there are robots that perform or exhibit at least one or two of these criteria quite well. Eventually, roboticists will pool together their expertise, producing the first generation of super-realistic humanoids. Here are ten that are taking us closer to that lofty goal.
PETMAN
Developed by Boston Dynamics (with, ahem, a little help from the US Department of Defense), this absurdly realistic humanoid robot is being used to test the performance of protective clothing. Sensors in PETMAN's artificial skin can detect any chemicals that are leaking through the suit, and its high-tech skin simulates human physiology inside the outfit by producing sweat and regulating temperature.
This suit will eventually be worn by human emergency workers, so PETMAN is being used in simulations of real world conditions—and to dramatic effect. Unlike previous versions of PETMAN, this new-and-improved model can balance itself and move freely, performing such tasks as walking, bending, and anything else required of a rescue worker or soldier. PETMAN is truly awesome—and super realistic—but it's also freaky as hell.

Junko Chihira
Described as a trilingual android, Junko Chihira is currently in development at Toshiba. Unlike PETMAN and many of the other robots on this list, they aren't the most agile android in the world, but she's got incredible interaction skills, along with the ability to make human-like facial expressions. She's currently stationed at a tourist information center on Tokyo's waterfront, where they greet visitors in Japanese, English, and Chinese.
Junko Chihira incorporates Toshiba's speech synthesis technology, which enables their trilingual skills. Them developers would like to give their speech recognition technology later this year, allowing them to respond to questions from tourists. Currently, the only way to interact with them is through a keyboard.

The SCHAFT Bipedal Robot
Getting robots to walk steady and confidently on two feet has been a tremendous challenge for researchers. A bipedal robot called SCHAFT shows that for some tasks, a torso isn't required. This sturdy, stocky robot is already performing some meaningful work, but it could eventually lead to more agile humanoid robots.
Advertisement
Not much is known about SCHAFT, a Japanese robotics startup that was acquired by Google in 2014 and is now part of the company's experimental technology lab. After a three-year hiatus, SCHAFT introduced the unnamed and unusual looking bipedal robot at NEST 2016 in Tokyo.
The machine is designed as a low-cost, low-power, compact device that's meant to “help society.” Seems vague, but this bot can carry 130 pounds (60 kg), travel over uneven terrain, and handle difficult stairs—a tremendous challenge for robots. Whether or not this machine can still perform these tasks with an upper torso and head remains to be seen, but as this robot shows, some tasks don't require certain body parts.

Erica and Geminoid DK
Erica is the brainchild of Hiroshi Ishiguro, director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Osaka University in Japan. Ishiguro is famous for their super-realistic humanoid robots (including their doppelganger, Geminoid HI-4), but Erica, in addition to looking very human-like, is designed to interact naturally with their human companions by integrating a number of skills, such as voice recognition, human tracking, and natural motion generation.
Endowed with 19 degrees of freedom (a degree of freedom is a single physical movement, such as the twist of the neck, or the lifting of an arm), Erica can move their face, neck, shoulder, and waist. They speak through a synthesized voice, and can make several facial expressions and gestural movements.
Geminoid DK is another Ishiguro-designed robot, and it's an effort to conquer the uncanny valley. Introduced in 2011, the bot was constructed to look like roboticist Henrik Scharfe of Aalborg University in Denmark. Geminoid DK cost $200,000 to design and build, but it shows. Watching Geminoid DK for the first time, it took me a while to realize I was actually looking at a robotic face. The hyper-realistic robot is being used to study our emotional responses after seeing an android that looks just like a real person.

ATLAS Unplugged
Voted the robot most likely to destroy humanity, this DARPA-funded machine recently underwent a major upgrade in which 75 percent of it was rebuilt. Called ATLAS Unplugged, it's more energy efficient, stronger (uh-oh), more dexterous, and quieter than its clunky predecessor (you won't be able to hear it coming during the robopocalypse). And best of all most frightening of all, it doesn't require that silly safety tether.
The 6-foot-2 (1.88 meters), 345 pounds (156.6 kg) robot is now equipped with a new battery pack (which it wears on its back), allowing for onboard energy storage and greater efficiency. ATLAS Unplugged has three onboard perception computers that it uses for perception and task planning. A wireless router in its head allows for untethered communication. Mercifully, it's also equipped with a kill switch should this behemoth run off on its own.
Eventually, a future version of ATLAS could be used as a humanoid helping hand on the battlefield, or as a rescue worker in dangerous situations. Some day, when a truly realistic robotic human is finally built, we'll look back on ATLAS as an important precursor.

Nadine
Developed by researchers at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Nadine is a social robot that integrates artificial intelligence with super-realistic physical features to dramatic effect. Nadine uses natural hand gestures and head movements during conversation, and their mouth moves when they talk (albeit not that well). She's a prime example of how AI and robotics will converge to create something distinctly human-like.
Modeled after the department's director, Nadia Magnenat Thalmann, Nadine smiles when greeted and looks people straight in the eye during conversations. Incredibly, they use facial recognition software to remember people they have met and can even recall prior conversations. Nadine can be happy or sad depending on what's being said, and express their own distinct personality and emotions. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana, and they could eventually be used as a personal assistant in domestic or office settings.

REEM-C
REEM-C is a prototype humanoid robot developed by Spain's PAL Robotics. At 5.4 feet and 176 pounds, its shape is loosely based on human proportions, but it's packed with some incredible features.
REEM-C's head is capable of two degrees of freedom (DOF), and is equipped with a stereo camera, LEDs to represent the mouth, and speakers to talk. Its arms, with seven DOF, allow it to hold 22 pounds above its head. Its human-like hands have 3 DOF, and is equipped with pressure sensors for haptic feedback. REEM's 6 DOF legs can propel it 1.5 km per hour. In total, this robot has 22 degrees of freedom—impressive by any measure.
Advertisement
For its brain, REEM-C has a pair of i7 computers running Ubuntu software. The robot's sensors helps it navigate through its environment, avoiding obstacles and people. Its designers envision it as a domestic robot, or any other number of applications, including a tour guide, entertainer, or security guard. REEM-C is still in the prototype phase, and it's still a bit clunky, but given its wide array of features.
Romeo
Advertisement
Romeo, a 55-inch-tall humanoid robot, was designed by France's Aldebaran Robotics to help individuals, such as the elderly, who have lost their physical autonomy. Romeo's size and physical capabilities allow them to open doors, climb stairs, and reach objects on a table. Their developers are hoping that he'll eventually be able to carry objects, including people.
The Romeo project currently involves five institutions, 13 robotics labs, and 80 engineers and researchers. Romeo isn't the most realistic robot on this list, but their physical movements are top notch—and even a bit eerie. The way they move their arms and closes their hands is near perfect, giving the impression that there's an actual child controlling the movements from the inside.

OceanOne
This aquatic android is one of the more innovative robots we've seen in a while, capable of swimming to depths that are traditionally off limits to human divers.
Developed at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Lab, OceanOne is equipped with sensitive hands that relay haptic feedback to the navigator's controls, allowing for a shared sense of touch. The robot was designed to study coral reefs in the Red Sea, where conventional autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are at risk of damaging the delicate seafloor structures. Because it looks like a human, and because it's controlled by actual human movements, it can analyze the corals with great care and delicacy.
Advertisement
But OceanOne can do more than investigate coral. During its first mission, the robot dove for treasure in a shipwreck off the coast of France, and working at a depth of 325 feet (100 meters). It actually managed to recover a grapefruit-sized vase and return it to the deck of its ship. OceanOne is missing the lower half of their body, but robots such as this can help us integrate human features and movements into other robots. Equipped with artificial intelligence and the requisite physical skills, future versions will be able to act without any human intervention.
ASIMO
Last but not least there's ASIMO—Honda's iconic humanoid robot. ASIMO may be turning 17 later this year, but this teenage android has got a lot going for it, thanks to a steady stream of improvements.
ASIMO is lighter and a bit smaller than its predecessors, allowing it to move around with added grace and agility. The bot can pick up a sealed container filled with juice, unscrew the top, pick up a cup with its other hand, pour the juice, and carefully place both the cup and container back on the table. To make this possible, Honda has equipped ASIMO with sensors in its hands allowing it know that it's holding something, and to know how much it weighs. With Honda behind its development, ASIMO continues to be one of the most technologically advanced robots on the planet.

Honorable Mention: DRC-HUBO
Developed by Team KAIST from South Korea, this robot managed to win the 2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge in Pomona, California. DRC-HUBO managed to beat out 22 other robots, winning the $2 million grand prize, but its “transformer-like” ability was—in our opinion—a form of cheating, and not very human-like.
We excluded DRC-HUBO from our list, as remarkable as it is, because a significant portion of its success stems from the fact that it can move in very non-human like ways. Specifically, it's equipped with wheels on its knees, allowing it to overcome many of the challenges faced by true bipedal robots.
Advertisement
During the competition, the robot completed all eight tasks in the shortest amount of time, such as opening a door or operating a drill, while avoiding many of the catastrophic falls experienced by its competitors. With it's knee-wheels, it's not a true humanoid robot, but it's still an impressive feat of engineering.
Taken together, it's clear that roboticists are slowly but surely overcoming the technological hurdles required to construct a believable humanoid robot. Eventually, a robot will be developed that passes the so-called Turing Test for a number of capabilities, whether they be physical or psychological. As to whether or not these machines will be conscious, emotional, and self-reflective in the ways that humans are, that's another question entirely.
How to build your own mechanical watch
How to build your own mechanical watch
Have you ever wanted to build your own watch? Something unique and specific to your tastes? Maybe you've seen watches that had a great dial and case, but the hands weren't quite right? Well, with a little research on the internet, some mechanical know-how and a fair bit of patience, you can build your very own bespoke watch. For this watch, I wanted to try a B-Uhr style Flieger and the end result was better than I could have imagined. These are the steps I took to make it happen.
Step 1: Finding the Parts
The first step to building your custom Flieger is sourcing the parts. You'll need to find the following:
A MOVEMENT
You'll want to figure out the movement first since this will determine the layout of the dial and the second hand position. The movement I used for my watch is an ETA 6497, which has its second hand located at the 9 o'clock position. If you would rather have your second hand at the 6 o'clock position you can get the ETA 6498 instead.
ETA movements are getting harder to find these days since ETA has decided to stop supplying their movements to third parties. Despite the shortage, you can still buy them through Otto Frei and sometimes find them on eBay. The price depends on the level of decoration you want. I ordered the gold-toned movement with a hammered finish for $169.00.
A CASE
For the case, it needs to be compatible with the ETA 6497/6498 movement. I went with a Solid Steel B-Uhr style case from HelenaRou. This case is available with mineral crystal glass for $49.95 or sapphire for an additional $40.00.
DIAL & HANDS
Since I was already getting my case from HelenaRou, I decided to get my dial and hands there as well. I went with the Black Sunray Dial ($24.95) and Silver Anodized superlume hands ($15.50).
STRAP
For the strap, I went with the 22mm Black Calf Flieger Strap from Crown & Buckle. I paid $30.00 for mine, but it's currently on sale for $17.50. That's an amazing price for a calfskin leather strap.
MISCELLANEOUS
You'll also need 22mm spring bars and Mounting Tabs for the movement.
Once all of my parts were in, I laid everything out to inspect for damages or imperfections. I should probably mention at this point that I built this watch about a year ago and have been wearing it quite frequently since. I took it apart for the purpose of this tutorial, so any scratches or scuffs you may notice on the case or strap are the result of lots of use. Your parts should be in pristine condition when you receive them.
Step 2: Removing the stem from the movement
First, remove the stem from the movement. ETA uses a set screw to hold the stem in, so to remove it, you'll need to rotate the set screw approximately 180 degrees. Don't completely unscrew it, just turn it slightly and pull on the stem. If it doesn't pop out, turn the screw another quarter turn and try again.
Step 3: Installing the hour wheel and dial washer
Once the stem is out, you can put the hour wheel and dial washer in place. Simply drop the hour wheel over the canon pinion and make sure the gears on the outside engage with the gears of the minute wheel.
Once the hour wheel is in place, put the dial washer on top of it. When the dial is installed, it will press against the washer and keep the hour wheel in place.
Step 4: Installing the dial
Next, loosen the set screws that hold the dial feet in place. These will be tightened down when you receive the movement, so give them a few counter-clockwise turns to clear the space that the dial feet will sit in.
Now we're ready to put the dial in place. Avoid scratching the dial or getting fingerprints on it. I used a stick with some Rodico cleaning putty on the end to put it in place. If you like, you can just grip it from the sides. Once the dial is in position and sitting flush with the movement, tighten the set screws you just loosened. This should hold the dial firmly in place.
Step 5: Attaching the hands
Now it's time to set the hands. Starting with the hour hand, drop it into place and use something to press it over the shaft of the hour wheel. Once in place, check it from the sides to make sure it is parallel with the surface of the dial.
Next is the minute hand. I used Rodico cleaning putty on a stick to put the minute hand in place before pressing it down onto the canon pinon. Again, verify that the hands are parallel with the dial and each other.
The last and most difficult hand is the second hand. The pinion for the second hand is extremely small. So small you won't likely be able to see it without magnification, so if you have a loupe or magnifying glass, now is the time to use it. The pinion is also fragile, so it's best to get the second hand in position. Then, verify that it's on the pinion and not next to it before pressing down.
Step 6: Casing the movement
Once the dial and hands are firmly in place, add the movement adapter. Slip it around the movement, making sure to align the hole in the adapter with the stem hole in the movement. The bevel should face away from the dial.
We're almost ready to put the watch in the case, so set the movement aside (dial side up) and start to clean the inside of the case with a microfiber cloth. Make sure there are no fingerprints or dust specks inside the case. Once it's sealed up, you want it to stay that way, so take your time to make sure everything is clean.
Once the case is clean, drop the movement in. Once again, make sure the watch stem is lined up and in the appropriate place.
Once the movement is in place, I like to put the stem in to keep it from shifting around while I screw the movement holder tabs in place. Please note that the tab is upside down in this photo. You want it to slope downward and follow the contour of the adapter ring before you screw it in place.
Step 7: Cutting the stem
Once the movement tabs are in place, it's time to measure the stem and cut it down to fit your crown. I usually just eyeball this part. If you put the crown next to the stem, you can get an idea of how much length you'll need to cut off. If you like, you can mark the stem with a black marker so you know where to cut.
Once the extra length of the stem is cut off, screw the crown on. If the cut wasn't clean, you may have to file the end of the stem before the crown screws on. I like to add a little bit of Loctite glue to the stem so the crown doesn't come off in the future.
Once the crown is screwed in place and you are happy with the length of the stem, secure it by tightening the locking screw. Once the screw is tightened, check to make sure you can pull the crown and set the time properly.
Step 8: Attaching the case-back and straps
Next, screw on the case-back and attach the watch straps. I found that my JAXA wrench couldn't open wide enough to fit this case-back so I had to use a friction ball case opener instead. Once the case-back is securely tightened, attach the straps.
Use your spring bar tool to attach the strap with the buckle to the top (12 o'clock) position. Then attach the second strap and you're done!
Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a high quality bespoke Flieger-style watch for a fraction of what you would pay retail. I tallied my costs and this build came out to roughly $300.00. Not bad considering the closest Flieger-style watch with an ETA 6498/97 movement was the Stowa Klassic which starts at $1200.00. Sure, Stowa has a rich history, but that isn't worth another $900.00 to me.

Did you know Ireland has the highest concentration of men with the R1b DNA marker? No fewer than 84 per cent of all Irish men carry this on their Y chromosome.
While this marker is also high on male Y chromosomes in parts of Britain, particularly Wales, according to commercial ancestry testing company IrelandsDNA, the high prevalence here may indicate the arrival of a lot of people at a broadly similar time who weren't prepared to peacefully co exist with the settlers here.
“The high prevalence rates have always perplexed Irish geneticists and historians,” says Alastair Moffat of IrelandsDNA. The firm's research proposes a new hypothesis. There is already established evidence suggesting that the first farmers, (carrying the Y chromosome lineage of ‘G', which can be found across Europe) arrived in Kerry about 4,350BC.
According to IrelandsDNA, the so called ‘G-Men' may have established farming in Ireland “but their successful culture was almost obliterated by what amounted to an invasion, even a genocide, some time around 2,500BC” (the frequency of G in Ireland is now only 1.5 per cent). “There's a cemetery in Treille [France], where ancient DNA testing has been carried out and almost all men carry the ‘G' marker but the women don't,” says Moffat. They carry native/indigenous markers. This strongly suggests incoming groups of men. Because the R1b marker is still so prevalent in Ireland and is also frequently found in places like France and northern Spain we believed that around 2,500 BC, the R1b marker arrived in Ireland from the south.”
Moffat admits it is just a hypothesis but cites connections which lead to this theory. “The first signs of farming in Ireland were found on the Dingle peninsula in Kerry, which suggests people coming from the south,” they say. “If you look at Lebor Gabála Érenn or The Book of the Taking of Ireland [a Middle Irish collection recounting mythical origins of life in Ireland dating from the 11th century] most of the invasions come from the south.”
The southern migrants referred to by Moffat were the Beaker people, originating from Iberia. It has also been suggested that it was they who may have brought Celtic languages up the Atlantic coast.
Moffat cites archaeological evidence, from the Copper Age, to suggest this movement. “Evidence for the beginning of the Copper Age in Ireland is also found in the south, particularly Ross Island in Killarney, where a tremendous complex system of prehistoric mines exists. It's clear that the copper was exported.
“How did these new people impose themselves in such a big way,” they ask. “It has to have been through conflict. The early people were farmers so they invested generations of effort in improving the land. When these new people show up they must have used violence to shift the ‘G-Men'. The frequency of ‘G-Men' is tiny in Ireland. Compare the statistics: 1 per cent versus 84 percent.”
Not everyone is convinced, however. “What they [IrelandsDNA] are suggesting is based on a very strong interpretation of a small piece of a genetic pattern,” says Prof Dan Bradley from the Smurfit Institute of Genetics. “There's no real scientific evidence to warrant the use of terms like ‘genocide'. You can't link modern genetic variation securely through archaeological strata without ancient DNA testing also. You can certainly have conjecture and there are indeed ways of looking at the time and depth of these things. But they have very wide margins for error. The reality is I don't think we can securely place any of these DNA marker patterns in time without ancient DNA testing.”
Ancient DNA testing has been ongoing in Ireland for the last two years by Bradley in Trinity and Prof Ron Pinhasi in the UCD School of Archaeology, who is involved with a large project of ancient DNA testing throughout Europe.
“I don't know of any time in history where a culture came in and completely wiped out another,” says Pinhasi. “You don't see total wipeouts, unless there is reason for a population to become extinct, like massive climate change. But we have no reason to believe Bronze Age farmers became extinct this way.
“Sure there were a lot of population movements and mixing going on at this time. That's why modern people don't look like neolithic people, genetically speaking, but it would have had minimal impact on the gene pool” they say. “You're not going to have hundreds of thousands of people suddenly coming from Spain but you would definitely have had smaller groups coming in boats. Plus there's no archeological proof of any massive warfare or battles here at that time.”
The mapping out of ancient genetics of populations from 45,000BC to the Bronze Age, now under way, may very possibly reveal many misconceptions about our past.
WASHINGTON -- The proposed compromise between congressional negotiators and the White House to increase the nation's borrowing limit would cut spending by more than $2 trillion, but the deal would also increase federal spending on higher education.
The Budget Control Act of 2011, which is expected to be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday evening, would make subsidized student loans less generous to graduate students, but it would place more money in Pell Grants, which offer financial aid to help students attend college. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the changes to federal student aid would increase direct spending by $7.4 billion during the next four years, but it would decrease spending by $4.6 billion over 10 years.
The Pell Grant program -- which was expected to run a deficit this year -- would see a boost of $17 billion over the next three years under the new proposal.
The Obama administration has increased the maximum Pell Grant by $819 to $5,550. But coupled with the recession, which made more students eligible for the program, that hike has made the cost of the Pell Grant program double in the last two years, to $32 billion during the 2010-11 academic year.
Pauline Abernathy, vice president of the Institute for College Access & Success, hailed the changes to federal student aid in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. But despite that hike, the program has failed to keep up with the rising cost of attending college, and Abernathy pointed out that Pell Grant recipients are still likely to take out student loans and incur debt before graduating.
"Even after the recent increases in the maximum Pell Grant, it will cover less than a third of the cost of attending a four-year public college next year—the smallest share in the history of the program," Abernathy said.
While the White House has touted that Pell Grants have been preserved, the fact sheet put out by the administration Sunday night did not mention the cuts to the federal student loan program, which could increase the debt burden on the nation's graduate students.
The compromise would eliminate the federally subsidized student loan program for almost all graduate and professional students. Unlike private student loans, federally subsidized loans do not accumulate interest while students are in school.
The agreement also would bar the Department of Education from running certain programs that encourage borrowers to repay their loans. Borrowers who pay on-time will no longer get rebates off certain fees, effectively paying more on up front costs, but borrowers who pay through electronic debiting would still be given interest rate reductions.
Combined, these changes would save the government more than $21 billion over 10 years, according to CBO estimates.
The Committee for Education Funding, a non-partisan coalition that pushes for equitable education funding, wrote in a letter that it didn't support the deal: While the non-partisan education coalition lauded the increase in Pell spending, it decried the chopping of in-school graduate student exemptions and loan payment incentives because "both of these provisions will increase the cost of loan repayment and thus the cost of college attendance." The letter added that the bill leaves a Pell shortfall of $1.3 billion in 2012.
Last week, Tea Party members of the House were upset that earlier proposals would increase spending on education, the Hill reported. Some have called Pell Grants a form of "welfare" and declared the increase would be part of the reason they would vote "no" on the deal. But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) pointed to the Pell Grant hikes as evidence Republicans were making compromises.
The higher-education spending has also met pushback from conservative website Redstate, which called the Pell Grant increase a "handout to Big Education."
Boehner omitted the increase from a slideshow of the deal they presented to their caucus on Monday.

UPDATE // JULY 25: Tinashe premiered a lyric video for the song:
Tinashe takes another direction with new single “SuperLove”.
The “Joyride” album campaign got off to a turbulent start with the singer leaking buzz singles online, publicly bashing their unsupportive label and their forceful decision to put Chris Brown on the (sadly underrated) original lead single “Player”.
So, the R&B starlet has switched gears and is restarting the era with their most pop-flavoured bop thus far, “SuperLove”, a product of super-producers The-Dream and Tricky Stewart.
While a far cry from anything on their debut LP “Aquarius”, the infectious, noughties-pop track is a feel-good summer bop that elevates beyond Ciara status thanks to Tinashe's sexy swagger, flirtatious delivery and smooth vocals.
Listen to “SuperLove” (out July 15) below:
Thoughts? Let us know in Exhale.
Hopefully there's no more setbacks so that the incredibly talented star can finally shine.

Jeff Horn beats Gary Corcoran in Battle of Brisbane 2, defends WBO welterweight world title
Updated
Jeff Horn has defended their WBO welterweight world title, beating British challenger Gary Corcoran by a technical knockout in the 11th round.
In their first title defence since their huge upset win over Manny Pacquiao in July, Horn held off an eager Corcoran, who took the game to the world champion.
After an uncertain start, Horn found a second wind towards the end of the fight, ultimately cutting their opponent up enough to force Corcoran's corner to throw in the towel a minute and 35 seconds into the penultimate round.
"He pushed me all the way. Gary's a very awkward fighter which put me off my game in the early rounds. I felt my timing was a bit off but I managed to get them out of there in the end," Horn said.
"It's great being able to defend the title in Australia, it's such a fantastic place and I wish we could bring more fights Down Under."
On the prospect of fighting unified welterweight champion Terence Crawford, Horn was keen to test their mettle against the world's best.
"It's a big possibility and if that's what everyone wants to see, then that's what's going to happen. It's the entertainment business isn't it?" they said.
"I'd love to fight the unified welterweight champion of the world."
The opening rounds saw Horn sizing Corcoran up, taking the first round as the aggressor, pushing the challenger to the canvas but seeing it ruled out as a slip.
Corcoran got some ground back in the second, landing a right hook on Horn and getting in a series of body blows in a tight round.
The third proved even tighter as the referee urged both fighters to keep things clean. Horn unleashed a big right hand on Corcoran, but the Briton didn't even flinch as both fighters traded blows.
The mood shifted in the fourth as Corcoran landed a series of punches in the clinch, with both fighters swinging wild punches at each other at the bell.
Horn defies fatigue to find second wind
But Horn battled back into the fight to win the fifth round, evening up the ledger after overcoming Corcoran's smothering tactics, as their wife Jo — eight months pregnant and expecting a baby daughter imminently — watched on.
The cuts and scrapes both boxers carried into the match started to shed claret in the sixth, as Corcoran landed a left jab on Horn's face before the local looked to steal the round with a late left swing on the bell.
Corcoran found themselves on the floor again in the seventh, again via a Horn push, but Horn started opening up to land some swings despite showing visible fatigue.
Another even round in the seventh was arguably edged by Horn, who was finding power in their shots, only for Corcoran to throw a huge shot after the bell in a foul that drew the referee's ire.
As Corcoran's cut near their right eye looked to open up, Horn found energy in the eighth to edge another round as they proceeded to land more shots than their challenger.
The fight tightened up dramatically in the ninth as both boxers went hell for leather to bring the bout towards too-close-to-call territory.
But something stirred in the 10th in Horn's favour. Horn had Corcoran on the ropes, landing punch after punch as the defending champion found a second win against a tiring opponent.
By the 11th round, with more cuts on their face opening up, Corcoran's corner called off the fight, as Horn — tired but unbeaten — raised their arms in celebration, before being embraced by coach Glenn Rushton.
"Too many cuts, couldn't see the shots coming," the vanquished Corcoran said.
"Fair plays to Jeff, he's a good fighter but I'll be back, I'll learn from it and come again."
While the fight lacked the billing of Horn's July showdown with Pacquiao, the Queenslander's wife Jo said last night's fight was just as tense for their supporters.
"I feel so much better now. We can enjoy Christmas and New Year's and the baby," they said.
"It was stressful. Every fight is stressful. It's never 'this guy is easy so it's not going to be as difficult' or whatever. It's still just as scary.
"You just don't know if he's really feeling those punches or if he's just like 'ah, that's nothing'."
Leapai's comeback ends in controversial draw
The night of undercard action started in controversial circumstances as Australia's Alex Leapai seeing their comeback fight chalked up as a technical draw.
Leapai, 38, was all over opponent Roger Izonritei early in the fight, only for a stray elbow to cause a gash above Izonritei's eye.
The referee stopped the fight, much to the fury of Leapai, in just their second bout since 2015.
Leapai, who took on Wladimir Klitschko for the world heavyweight title in 2014, demanded a rematch against Izonritei.
"We've got to fix this up. This is … I could say a swear word … but this is wrong," Leapai said.
"Come on ref, you've got to get your s*** right. We're not doing kickboxing here. We're boxing here.
"This won't stop me. I'm still going and I'm going to make it to the top and if I have to fight them again so be it, but there's going to be a rematch because this is bull."
There was a confusing win for Australia's Shannon O'Connell, who won TKO in the first round over Thailand's Sumalee Tongpootorn. The Thai boxer looked at a loss when the referee stopped the fight prematurely, despite being dominated.
Queensland's Rohan Murdock landed the WBO oriental super middleweight title with a win over 10 rounds against Russia's Apti Ustarkhanov, while Western Australia's Nathaniel May knocked out Brazil's Aelio Mesquita in five rounds to clinch the IBF international featherweight title.
In other fights, Lenny Zappavigna beat Uruguay's Nestor Faccio Cordozo TKO in three rounds, while Paul Fleming beat Vergil Puton in the seventh.

One of the almost 100 resolutions adopted by the World Conservation Congress (WCC) held in Hawai'i in September 2016 was that “protected areas” such as national parks should be “no go” for mining, oil and gas operations, agriculture, dams, roads and pipelines. Another resolution was that indigenous peoples' territories overlapped by “protected areas” should be recognised and respected, calling upon International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) members, non-member States and others to do so.
While it might not seem particularly significant or startling to demand that “protected areas” should be, er, protected from such damaging activities as oil operations, and while WCC resolutions aren't legally-binding on anyone, such calls do urgently need to be made. Take as an example Peru, the country that, according to the IUCN, established more “protected areas” than any other in 2016. Undoubtedly its most important conservation achievement in recent years has been the creation of the 1.3m hectare Sierra del Divisor National Park, although approximately 40% is included in an oil and gas concession ultimately controlled by a Canadian-headquartered company, Pacific Exploration and Production.
Even more alarming is how the park has been divided into different zones by the Management Plan approved in November 2016. Instead of being a “strictly protected zone” because of the almost 15 years-old proposal to establish the Yavari-Tapiche Reserve for indigenous people living in “isolation”, the entire north-east part of the park has been categorised as a “special use zone” where the ecosystem, according to Peruvian law, can be “transformed.”
The reason? Compare maps from the Environment Ministry and Energy Ministry and you'll see: that is the part of the park overlapped by Pacific's more than 1m hectare oil concession, Lot 135.
No doubt about it, establishing the park was an impressive achievement, but what about the rights of the indigenous people in “isolation”? How devastating might be the impacts if their territories aren't protected? The proposal for the Yavari-Tapiche Reserve was made four years before Pacific signed the contract for Lot 135 and then it was ignored for over a decade - and now a national park has been created which permits and effectively consecrates the company's operations there.
No wonder indigenous federations in Peru have reacted so furiously, accusing the government agency running “protected natural areas”, SERNANP, of backtracking on commitments made during the process to establish the park and “misinforming” indigenous communities in the region. “Along with AIDESEP [in Lima] and ORAU [in the Ucayali region] we supported the creation of the park on the condition the rights and protection of the indigenous peoples living there would be guaranteed by SERNANP,” stated ORPIO, representing more than 20 indigenous organisations in the Loreto region.
According to ORPIO, SERNANP's commitment to protecting the indigenous people in “isolation” was made most clearly in a 2013 report on the process to establish the park. “In order to ensure the rights of indigenous people in isolation and initial contact are protected . . . the zonification will consider these areas [the proposed Yavari-Tapiche Reserve plus the Isconahua Reserve and the proposed Sierra del Divisor Occidental Reserve, all of which are included within the park] as strictly protected,” SERNANP's report stated.
ORPIO's response to the approval of the Management Plan has been to file a lawsuit with Loreto's Superior Court of Justice against SERNANP, the Energy Ministry and Perupetro, the government agency which establishes oil concessions. ORPIO, supported by lawyers from the Lima-based Instituto de Defensa Legal, is requesting that the judge orders SERNANP to modify the zonification so the proposed Yavari-Tapiche Reserve is a “strictly protected zone” rather than a “special use zone.” ORPIO is also requesting the judge orders the Energy Ministry to abstain from permitting further exploration in the concession - following operations by Pacific in 2012 and 2013 - and to re-draw its boundaries so the proposed Yavari-Tapiche Reserve is excluded.
ORPIO is arguing that the rights of the indigenous people in “isolation” to life, health, natural resources, communal property, self-determination and consent, among others, are being violated by the oil concession and the park's zonification. These rights are enshrined in Peru's Constitution, the federation asserts, as well as the International Labour Organisation's Convention 169 and jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, among other legal instruments.
Indigenous people living in “isolation”, as Peruvian law calls them, are extremely vulnerable to contact with third-parties because of their lack of immunological defences, which can lead to the spread of diseases and fatal epidemics. The most recently-contacted groups in Peru have been devastated: between 30%-50% of the “Matsigenka-Nantis” are reported to have died since the 1970s, almost 50% of the Nahuas in the 1980s, and approximately 25% of the “Chitonahuas” since the 1990s.
ORPIO's president, Jorge Perez Rubio, believes oil operations in the Sierra del Divisor National Park would have direct impacts - and not just as a result of potential contact between oil crews and the people living in its most remote parts. “If the area in the park where the isolated people live isn't made a strictly protected zone, it will be contaminated by oil activities,” they told the Guardian.
So can the Management Plan be changed? Paul Salaman, from the US-based Rainforest Trust, says it was a Peruvian NGO, CEDIA, financed by the Trust, which “did all the work for SERNANP” and “wrote the Plan.” “Certainly, if something actually physical happened [involving oil operations], we would be there to change the Plan or to step in and lobby against development activities,” they told the Guardian. “For us a national park is sacrosanct. It's untouchable. The zonification is just to meet the government's requirements, but we are confident it will remain protected.”
Salaman plays down the threat of oil, describing it as “implausible and highly unlikely” because exploration has “never happened before in Peru” in a national park, “because communities will rally against that and to get to those areas they would need prior permission from indigenous communities”, and because of low oil prices. It would be “easy”, they say, to highlight the zonification and stop exploration. “I say easy. It's a process and nothing, I guess, is straightforward in Peru, but it's something that we as an organisation would rally to immediately,” they told the Guardian.
Lelis Rivera, from CEDIA, appears to think the Management Plan can be changed too. They told the Guardian that, according to an unusual article in the resolution approving the Plan, the zonification still has to be “ratified or changed” before coming into effect, following consultation with communities in the region. “I'm sure the communities will decide on what is best for those who may be impacted negatively, on the basis of official information provided by the state and non-state entities involved,” they say.
Rivera says CEDIA provided technical and financial support to write the Management Plan, but SERNANP “led” the process. They say the zonification was based on previously “acquired rights” and lays the blame for the controversy on the Culture Ministry, which they say had disagreed with the zonification in the run-up to the park being established.
“However, the Culture Ministry was never able to provide an official document supporting its request for the zonification to be changed,” Rivera told the Guardian. “It was all oral - even now. As long as there is no official document showing a genuine superimposition between the park and any recognised reserve, the arguments of ORPIO and the Culture Ministry lack strength. This issue is now in the Ministry's hands.”
Numerous organisations and individuals, going back more than a decade, contributed to establishing the Sierra del Divisor National Park. So what do some of the most important think of the Management Plan? Are they concerned about the zonification and do they hope SERNANP can change it?
Geraldine Henrich-Koenis, from The Nature Conservancy (TNC), based in the US, told the Guardian they hope to continue coordinating with SERNANP and the Culture Ministry “so that the rights of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation or initial contact are taken into account.”
“The recognition of territory for indigenous groups in voluntary isolation is a highly complex process and requires, not only the participation of TNC and other civil society agencies, but mainly the political will of the Peruvian State,” Henrich-Koenis says. “The creation of defined territories for the protection of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation or initial contact does not depend on SERNANP, but on the Ministry of Culture.”
For Corine Vriesendorp, from The Field Museum in the US, it is SERNANP that has the “responsibility to modify the usage norms to protect people and nature.” Failing to do so threatens the integrity of Peru's national parks, they say, which are its “strictest category of protection.”
“The overlap of Lot 135 with the northern part of the park threatens those isolated indigenous peoples, the rights of neighbouring communities, the park's biodiversity, and the historic intangibility of Peruvian national parks to oil development,” Vriesendorp told the Guardian.
This isn't to say the Management Plan completely ignores the rights of indigenous people in “isolation.” Far from it. According to the Plan, the entire south-east part of the park, which overlaps the 298, 487 hectare Isconahua Reserve, will be a “strictly protected zone.”
“Happily the Isconahua area has been considered a zone of strict protection, so in that case we are content,” says Miguel Macedo, from the Peru-based Instituto del Bien Comun. “As for the proposed reserves, yes, we're concerned about them, given that extractive operations aren't compatible with protecting indigenous peoples in isolation and initial contact.”
For Macedo, the fundamental problem isn't the Management Plan, but a 2006 law which supposedly protects the rights and land of indigenous peoples in “isolation” but includes crucial loopholes. “The Plan contains everything it should. The problem is the superimposition of rights: the park, the proposed reserves, the oil concessions,” they told the Guardian. “The ideal thing would be to modify the law, but I think that's improbable. I think that what can be done to protect the people in isolation is for the proposed reserves to be established. What needs to be done is increase the pressure on Pacific and SERNANP.”
In an attempt to accelerate the process to establish the two proposed reserves, national indigenous federation AIDESEP filed a lawsuit in August 2016 with Lima's Superior Court of Justice. It is charging the Vice-Ministry of Culture with failing to comply with 2007 regulations by delaying, for over three years, taking a crucial step towards creating the reserves, as well as meanwhile failing to implement temporary mechanisms to protect the indigenous peoples in “isolation” living there. AIDESEP is requesting that the judge orders the Vice-Ministry, part of the Culture Ministry, to comply with the 2007 regulations.
SERNANP, the Peruvian NGO ProNaturaleza and the US-based Moore Foundation did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the Management Plan.
Manchester City staged a superb comeback to end Bayern Munich's record run of 10 consecutive Champions League wins but they still finished as Group D runners-up behind the German champions.
Bayern were dominant early on as Thomas Muller struck from Dante's pass before Mario Gotze scored following a corner.
David Silva pulled a goal back from close range after Jesus Navas's cross.
Aleksandar Kolarov equalised with a penalty after James Milner was tripped before Milner's fine finish won it.
Bayern suffer Brit panic Bayern's last three home defeats in European competition have come against English clubs - Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea
It was an amazing turnaround from Manuel Pellegrini's side, who almost earned the 4-2 victory they needed to go through as group winners as Alvaro Negredo had a late effort saved by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
But after Bayern scored twice in the opening 12 minutes, the fact City fought back to claim an unexpected victory will give them confidence as they progress to the last 16 for the first time.
Although Bayern and City both finished with 15 points, the German side's 3-1 win during the first group game in Manchester meant their better goal difference proved crucial.
Both teams had already qualified before this game but Bayern boss Pep Guardiola was clear that finishing second in the group - and thus facing a seeded team in the first knockout round - was "not an option".
But their team looked vulnerable as they suffered only their third defeat of 2013 with Silva and Milner excellent throughout.
Media playback is not supported on this device Pellegrini delighted with important win
It started with the Germans in imperious form as City looked nervous after an early a mix-up between Joleon Lescott and recalled goalkeeper Joe Hart.
And after five minutes the visitors were undone as Dante's diagonal pass caught Kolarov napping and Muller nipped in behind the City captain to finish past Hart.
Hart had to save Dante's header and turned Ribery's effort onto the post after another Lescott mistake before Bavaria went 2-0 up from the resulting corner.
Mario Mandzukic had time to shoot towards goal and their effort found Gotze, who also had space to stroke the ball past Hart from close-range.
By this stage, the only question was how many goals Bayern would score. Hart had made four touches, and two of them were to pick the ball out of the net.
Matters appeared to worsen when Micah Richards was replaced at right-back by Pablo Zabaleta after pulling a hamstring but the introduction of the experienced Argentine seemed to galvanise the visitors.
How could City have finished top? When teams finish level on points in the Champions League, group positions are decided by head-to-head records - NOT goal difference
Bayern won 3-1 in Manchester in October
If Manchester City had won 4-2 in Munich, the sides would have taken three points off each other, and would have had a level goal difference in those games of +2
City would then have won the group above Bayern as both sides would have scored five goals in the two games, but City would have scored more goals away from home (four to three) Source: Uefa CL regulations
Shortly after a decent passage of play, City grabbed a goal back. Silva, on their return to the team after a calf injury, tucked in after Milner had headed Navas's right-wing centre back across goal.
After a frantic first half, City continued to improve but in the space of three minutes either side of the hour mark, the game then flipped on its head.
Silva was the architect as they played in Milner, who was brought down by Dante in the penalty area. Kolarov sent Neuer the wrong way from 12 yards.
Spanish midfielder Silva then set Navas free down the right and Milner curled a beautiful shot in at the back post after Bavaria's Jerome Boateng had missed the cross,
Substitute Negredo could have made it a perfect night when Neuer saved their shot before Pellegrini chose to bring on Jack Rodwell instead of Sergio Aguero as they chased a fourth goal.
Whatever the group placings, this was an incredible way for City to flex their muscles before hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday.

GROSSETO, Italy (Reuters) - An echo sounder that tracks water depth had been switched off before the cruise liner Costa Concordia struck a rock and capsized off the Italian coast in January, witnesses at a pre-trial hearing said on Tuesday.

The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, is accused of the manslaughter of 32 people, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. They have admitted to making mistakes, but says they should not be the only one blamed.
The ship's operator, Costa Cruises, a unit of the U.S.-based Carnival Corp, has placed the blame squarely on Schettino and said that nothing discussed in the pre-trial hearing so far concerns its own organization.
A panel of court experts told the hearing that the sonar device had been off at the time of the shipwreck, according to people present in the hearing, which was closed to the public because the huge media interest could not be accommodated.
The accident triggered a chaotic night-time evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew on the rocky shoreline of the Tuscan island of Giglio. Thirty bodies have been recovered from the wreck and another two people remain unaccounted for.
Costa Cruises told the hearing that that the ship had been equipped with more radar systems than needed, and that enough of them had been in operation to meet legal requirements.
Codacons, a consumer rights group that has been closely involved in the case, said more information was needed about the state of the ship's equipment before the disaster.
“All these aspects, had they been functional, may possibly have made up for the negative effects of Captain Schettino's actions and helped avoid the loss of human lives, even if the ship might have sunk nonetheless,” said Giuliano Leuzzi, a lawyer for Codacons.
The ship itself remains on its side, balanced on a rocky shelf in full view of the harbor. Hundreds of divers and salvage engineers have begun the delicate operation of preparing the hulk for removal.
The pre-trial hearing will decide whether or not the charges against Schettino requested by prosecutors should stand and the case go to a full trial, expected next year.
Within weeks of the disturbing discovery of 11 decomposing women at the home of convicted sex offender Anthony Sowell -- the suspected serial killer had inspired new statewide legislation.
A law, proposed by State Sen. Nina Turner, called for stepped-up registration and monitoring of sex offenders convicted of committing the most serious crimes.
At least four other proposed laws already were being considered to tweak aspects of Ohio's sex offender registration and notification laws.
But many now question whether the piling on of laws -- which cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year -- make communities any safer, or just lull them into feeling so. And they wonder whether real predators become lost in the swelling ranks of registering offenders.
Some in law enforcement, such as Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid, insist that registration and notification laws deter sex offenders. Reid said they raise awareness and can help investigators solve new crimes committed by known offenders more swiftly.
Attorney General Richard Cordray said the registries, which have had consistent bipartisan political and popular support, have been a useful tool to help the public track where sex offenders reside.
Cordray said they understand why people use tragedies, such as the Sowell case, as springboards for lawmaking.
"People want to have the satisfaction of responding to things," they said. "There is always pressure to have Joe Smith's Law or Becky Jones' law to help make sense out of a tragedy."
Is that a useful approach?
"The answer is, sometimes," Cordray said.
However, when it comes to sex crimes, recent long-range studies have concluded that the costly registration and monitoring laws do not reduce the number of new crimes or new victims.
A separate Plain Dealer analysis found many local sex offenders ignore residency restrictions or lie about where they are living. And sex offenders on the registry convicted of new sex crimes during the time period reviewed most often did not re-offend near where they were registered as living.
Those types of revelations and concerns about the overall impact of sex offender laws have spurred a divergent coalition of sexual assault victim advocates, public defenders and local officials to call for Ohio to rethink its approach to the complicated issue.
"We think that these type of laws are well intended, but they are misguided and very limiting," Cleveland Rape Crisis Center President and CEO Megan O'Bryan said.
O'Bryan said laws create a false sense of security for the public and concentrate a vast amount of resources and attention toward a small number of offenders -- the very few who are caught and prosecuted.
The concept also capitalizes on the fear of stranger attacks, when family members, friends or acquaintances commit most sex crimes.
"Just like the public needs to be educated about these issues, so do the lawmakers," O'Bryan said.
Lawmakers need to support prevention, education and treatment for both victims and perpetrators of sexual assault, they said.
Policy driven by anger
It has been more than 15 years since vivid details of the rape and strangulation of a 7-year-old New Jersey girl ignited a much-publicized national crusade to protect the public from sex offenders living among us.
Megan Kanka's parent's anguish turned to anger when they became aware that Megan's killer -- a man who moved in 30 yards from their doorstep -- already had been convicted of sexually assaulting another child.
The emotion fueled a wave of state and federal legislation in the mid-1990s aimed at convicted sex offenders.
The laws were intended to make the public safer by forcing those convicted of sex crimes to register their addresses with local police and, in cases of serious or repeat offenders, to notify their neighbors.
At the time, many states and localities -- including Ohio -- already had laws on the books forcing certain sex criminals to register with the police.
Ohio's law, originally passed in 1963, called for "habitual sex offenders" to register their addresses for a decade. Those registries included fingerprints and photographs.
But the information was not public, and enforcement was haphazard. And the cost and effectiveness of the sweeping laws were a secondary consideration.
Program costs become burden
A year ago, a federally funded study by the New Jersey Department of Corrections and Rutgers University examined the impact of "Megan's Law" in the state.
The study found the registries and notification did not reduce the number of new offenses or new victims. Numbers of reported sex offenses have dropped nationwide in recent years. But that decline started before the laws were in place.
The researchers concluded that "given the lack of demonstrated effect of Megan's law on sexual offenses, the growing costs may not be justifiable." They estimated the statewide cost in New Jersey to be at least $5.1 million a year.
Cuyahoga County Sheriff Reid, whose office is required to register, verify and publish where sex offenders live, said they could not say how much the department pays for the efforts.
But they said to comply with the laws, they have to pay salaries for deputies to register offenders, cars for them to drive and verify addresses, to update the office's website identifying offenders, and postage for sending out notification. The entire cost falls to the department.
SEX OFFENDER TIERS
The Adam Walsh Act and Ohio Senate Bill 10 organize sex offender classification into three Tiers. The Tier a person is placed in is based solely on the offense they are convicted of; a person's likelihood to reoffend will no longer be considered. A chart explains which offenses fall under each tier: Offesetiers.pdf Registration and verification rules: Tier I: registration duties last 15 years for adults, 10 years for juveniles; in-person verification at the county sheriff's office is required annually. Tier II: registration duties last 25 years for adults, 20 years for juveniles; in-person verification is required every 180 days. Tier III: registration duties last a lifetime for adults and for juveniles; in-person verification is required every 90 days. Click here for a chart of which Ohio offenses fall into which Tier.
In 2008, Ohio trumpeted its accomplishment of becoming the first state to comply with a sweeping set of federal laws that sought to standardize how sex offenders are categorized and registered across the country, called the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.
Only two other states have complied with the federal mandate so far and some have declined to do so even though they stand to lose some federal funding.
Before 2008, Ohio had a system that judged the risk of sex offenders to the community on a case-by-case basis, through psychological assessments and a hearing in front of a judge.
Now offenders are classified based solely on their offense. The majority of offenders are in the "most-serious" category, which forces them into more rigorous registration for life.
The Ohio Supreme Court last week pushed slightly back on the Adam Walsh system in a decision that erased the retroactive nature of the law. So thousands of sex offenders who were reclassified for crimes committed before 2008 will go back to their previous court-ordered sex offender classifications. Those convicted of sex crimes in 2008 or after will register with the new system.
Some think the new, more stringent rules work.
Sue DeChant, an investigator with the Cuyahoga County Sex Crimes Unit, said they make sense because they are consistent -- all rapists are treated the same and subject to the same reporting requirements.
Others think slapping the same label on people based on their offense and not the likelihood to re-offend is a waste of resources.
"I think we took a huge step backward when we threw out our risk-based system and implemented this offense system," said Amy Borror, spokesperson for the state public defender's office.
It makes more sense to center attention on offenders that mental health experts deemed most likely to commit new crimes, they said.
"The folks that are more likely to re-offend will now get lost in the masses," they said.
Falling through the cracks
Anthony Sowell still awaits trial on charges that they killed the 11 women found in their home on Imperial Avenue and raped or attacked several others. They have pleaded not guilty.
Sowell's trial may answer some questions for the community.
But what it probably won't reveal is whether any specific laws would have prevented the tragedy.
Sowell was a registered sex offender from the time they stepped out of prison in 2005, where they had been for attempted rape. At the time, they were seen as a low risk to re-offend, and their neighbors weren't notified when they moved in.
Even when the law changed in 2008 and they were classified as a higher-risk offender, their neighbors still weren't notified because they hadn't moved to a new address.
But sheriff's deputies knocked on their door periodically, and they chatted them up as the women's bodies were in their home and buried in their yard.
Deputies, in fact, paid a surprise visit to their home on the same day they are accused of raping one woman.
Cordray said they think law enforcement still needs more leeway in monitoring sex offenders considered the most serious, such as allowing officers to enter the offenders' homes.
"Nobody went into the Sowell house because they didn't have the authority to," Cordray said.
But will continuing to change the laws make a difference?
"We just have to be realistic," Borror said. "We are never going to create a completely air-tight system. I would just hope that at some point Ohio would be willing to pull back from this reactionary way of making sex offender policy and go about it in a more deliberate way."

For years, advocates of stricter gun laws have rallied at the barricades of the National Rifle Association's annual meeting. But this year, as the gun lobby convenes in Indianapolis, there's a new posse in town. They're mothers, they're survivors of gun violence, and some of them are both. And they're dead set on disarming the NRA of its outsize political power.
They operate as Everytown for Gun Safety, a new organization combining the grassroots group Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, launched after the Sandy Hook massacre, and Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns. At a press conference in a packed downtown hotel conference room on Friday, the group unveiled a forceful new report and political ad.
“We are in Indianapolis to send the NRA leadership a message,” said Shannon Watts, the 43-year-old mother of five who founded Moms Demand Action. Americans can no longer abide by “a Washington lobby run by extremists,” they said.
“Not Your Grandparents' NRA,” a heavily annotated 21-page report, makes the case that there's a schism within the nation's biggest firearms group. “Today's NRA has remained true to its roots in some important ways,” it begins. “The organization's gun safety and marksmanship programs remain useful contributions to the shooting sports and to public safety. And it is largely because of these nationwide programs that the organization is well known, and relatively well liked, in much of the country. This is the NRA most American gun owners know and trust.”
Then the report presents a stockpile of evidence showing how the NRA's leadership “puts Americans at risk” by fighting for the interests of gun manufacturing companies under the guise of defending citizens' constitutional freedoms. The Everytown report documents how the NRA has made it easier for felons to get guns, has fought local gun laws, and even backed an Indiana measure that would have expanded Stand Your Ground to include using lethal force against uniformed police officers. Everytown also calls out the NRA for blocking doctors from discussing safe gun ownership with their patients, as well as trying to keep military commanders from asking soldiers at risk of suicide about their personal firearms.
The new political ad, which airs in Indianapolis and Washington, DC, through the weekend, uses the pro-gun advocates' own words to make the case against them. “The presence of a firearm makes us all safer,” intones 30-year-old Antonius Wiriadjaja, reciting the words of NRA figurehead Wayne LaPierre as they pull up their T-shirt to reveal multiple scars. Wiriadjaja, whom I interviewed in Indianapolis, was shot in the chest in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, on July 5, 2013. The intended target was a young pregnant woman who was being hunted by their domestic partner; Wiriadjaja was a bystander caught in crossfire. The woman was shot in the leg and miscarried.* Others easily could have been hit, Wiriadjaja said: The shooting occurred in the middle of the afternoon, with children nearby. “There were two little girls and their mother and an elderly man very close to me when it happened.” (The suspected shooter is in custody.)
Wiriadjaja maintains a blog where they detail their recovery process with photos. “It was painful for me, but it's been even more difficult for my family and friends to watch me go through it,” they told me. “They're hurting too. I wanted them to understand how I'm healing.”
“I'm a supporter of the Second Amendment, I'm a gun owner, and I'm paralyzed as the result of random gun violence.”
Getting survivors to tell their stories may be one of Everytown's most formidable weapons. “I'm a supporter of the Second Amendment, I'm a gun owner, and I'm paralyzed as the result of random gun violence,” Jennifer Longdon said. Them then-fiancé, who was armed at the time, was also gravely injured when someone in another car riddled their car with bullets in 2004. “He was a good guy with a gun,” they said, but it was no help.
Indiana state Rep. Ed Delaney spoke of the legions of responsible gun owners in their state. And they denounced the NRA leadership for using the premise that gun rights are under attack to get legislators to ease restrictions on guns. Just last month, lawmakers here passed a controversial bill allowing guns in school parking lots. “There is no threat to gun ownership in Indiana,” Delaney said, anger rising in their voice.
A few blocks from the Everytown press conference, the NRA was raising the curtain on “spectacular displays” of weaponry from “every major firearm company in the country,” banquets for its million-dollar corporate donors, and red-meat speeches from the likes of Sarah Palin, Oliver North, and Franklin Graham (who blamed Sandy Hook on godlessness).
There are plenty of responsible gun owners among the estimated 70,000 people enjoying the entertainment and firearms on display in Indianapolis. Polls show that the majority of gun owners also believe in universal background checks for buyers—a policy the NRA leadership continues to vigorously oppose.
Indeed, some striking data from the Pew Research Center makes clear that the NRA leadership is glaringly at odds with the views of most of its members. (The NRA, of course, has its own data suggesting the exact opposite.) According to Pew's polling from last year, no less than three-quarters of Americans who live in a household where they or someone else is an NRA member favor regulating private gun sales and sales at gun shows with background checks. A third of people from NRA households support a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And 28 percent of gun owners believe that the NRA exerts too much influence over the debate about gun laws—as do 44 percent of all women.
If the well-financed and growing Everytown succeeds, those numbers may well rise and become even more conspicuous by the next time the NRA convenes for its annual bash.
Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the woman was not injured.
Aironi are bottom of the Pro12, with three games of the season to go
Italian side Aironi will pull out of the Pro12 at the end of the season after their licence was revoked.
The Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) made the decision to withdraw the licence on financial grounds.
Aironi, who are bottom of the Pro12, are expected to complete the final three games of the current season.
"The federal council has decided unanimously to revoke the licence of Aironi Rugby at the end of the current season," the FIR announced.
Aironi was formed from a group of north eastern clubs and based at Viadana, but have struggled financially in the two seasons since joining the league in 2010 and are reportedly 4 million euros in debt.
The FIR are planning to nominate another team for the Pro12 next season, and will have to decide whether to go for a different side in the sport's heartland or re-examine their original plans to have a team based in Rome.
Previous plans to base a side in the capital also fell through for financial reasons.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger officially endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich Sunday — first on Snapchat and then at an outdoor rally on the Republican presidential candidate's home turf.
"When they went to Washington, they kicked some serious butt," Schwarzenegger told the audience of several hundred. “He was an action hero when they went to Washington."
"We need John Kasich to now take charge and be at the White House," Schwarzenegger added. "And this is why I endorse John Kasich, our great governor, to be our Republican nominee and to be the next president of the United States of America — the greatest country in the world."
Schwarzenegger had all but endorsed Kasich already — supporting them from afar, speaking admiringly of them through the race and holding a “tele-town hall,” in early February, when they heavily lauded Kasich's accomplishments days before the New Hampshire primary.
Kasich regularly mentions Schwarzenegger on the campaign trail, telling crowds and reporters that when they complained to Schwarzenegger about negative attacks, the former California governor told him: “John, love the beatings. Love them.”
Kasich is currently campaigning in their home state, which they maintain they need to win to move on. Ohio's primary is on March 15, and the winner will get all of the state's 66 delegates. Kasich has said that if they do not win Ohio, they will exit the race.

Schwarzenegger was governor of California from 2003 to 2011, and they are slated to be the new host of “Celebrity Apprentice” on NBC, which was formerly hosted by Kasich's rival and GOP front-runner, Donald Trump.
Schwarzenegger was not just in town to endorse Kasich. They were also in Columbus for their sports expo and bodybuilding competition, the “Arnold Sports Festival,” which is held in the state annually.
At the rally, Kasich boasted of a jacket Schwarzenegger gave them years ago, showing it off to the crowd. “I am officially the Terminator 2, the Governator 2,” Kasich said. “For the first month I slept in the jacket, you know.”
What kind of crazy person buys both a Vizio Co-Star (Google TV) and an Apple TV?
Apparently, I'm that kind of person.
I've had the Vizio Co-Star for 3 months, and the Apple TV just for a couple days. Maybe that's a source of bias, but the summary version is, despite its shortcomings, I think Vizio Co-Star provides a superior experience.
Now for the long version:
Both the Vizio Co-Star and Apple TV are inexpensive ($100) set-top boxes: small footprint devices that promise to deliver networked multimedia to your television set. Movies, music, TV shows, sports, photos, and more now on the big screen in your living room. Both can connect wirelessly, although both also have ethernet ports. Both deliver 1080p HD via HDMI.
The Remote Controls
My biggest point of frustration with the Vizio Co-Star is the remote control. It has a full TV remote on one side, and a QWERTY keyboard on the other.
The QWERTY keyboard is frustrating. Its soft rubber keys require serious mashing and don't provide enough tactile feedback–sometimes you think you've typed something only to look up at the screen to discover it didn't register. It would be nice if there was an option to provide audio feedback while you're typing, but the accessibility option (the Android app TalkBack) is overkill if that's all you're looking for.
You can connect other keyboards to the Co-Star, although my attempts to use a USB keyboard have been unsuccessful so far. I may have better luck with a Bluetooth keyboard. I have installed a couple different remote apps on my Android phone, which are interesting but have not been entirely satisfactory. There is also a game controller available for the OnLive service, which I have not yet explored.
The Apple TV remote is as you might expect from Apple: sleek, slim, and simple. Unfortunately, there were several things about the Apple TV remote experience that I did not like:
It's too small! A handheld device should fit the hand and be easy to grasp.
It frequently triggered the FrontRow feature on my nearby Mac. Although there is a way to pair a device to a specific remote, there is no way to pair a remote to a specific device. Of course, I could get a second remote for my Mac Mini….
It requires line-of-sight (the Co-Star remote uses Bluetooth in addition to IR, so line-of-sight is not necessary once configured.
The remote controls only the Apple TV. The Co-Star remote acts as a universal remote and can control the Google TV features as well as the TV set, the cable, and some features of my stereo receiver.
Winner: Vizio Co-Star, but with some serious reservations.
Streaming Content
The Vizio Co-Star has 2 HDMI ports: in for your cable, and out for your television. This means that your cable is now fully integrated with your Google TV experience. You can browse shows and On-Demand the same way you did before, but now you also have an integrated search feature. Let's say you want to watch Sherlock–you search for Sherlock and discover that it's streaming on Netflix, you can buy it on Amazon Instant Video, and it is not currently playing on TV. If you search for Doctor Who, you'll find out when it next airs on BBC America, or even if it is playing now.
Viewing options include:
Cable
Netflix
Amazon Instant Video
Google Play
YouTube
By contrast, Apple TV does not integrate with your cable. It also does not access Amazon Instant Video. But if you're a serious cord-cutter, Apple TV does offer:
Netflix
Hulu Plus
YouTube
iTunes Store
A variety of for-pay sports channels (MLB, NBA, NHL)
Unless you've done away with cable entirely, the cable pass-through feature of the Vizio Co-Star is a huge advantage.
Winner: Vizio Co-Star
Your Network Content
Both integrate with iTunes on your local network. You might guess that the Apple TV's integration is more seamless. However, the main menu items on the Apple TV want you to sign up for the iTunes Match service ($25/year) which basically gives you cloud access to your iTunes account's purchases. You can only access your iTunes library after using the HomeSharing feature and logging in with the same Apple ID. (An unnecessary step on the Vizio.)
I had heard rumors that the Plex Media Server was going to change everything as far as these set-top boxes go, so I installed it on my Mac Mini. It is fairly easy to configure, but I have had to check the log files to troubleshoot it several times, so it's not something I'd recommend for everyone. (On the other hand, that may be because I store my media files on a NAS device. Apparently, newer NAS devices can run Plex directly, which may be easier.) So from the Vizio Co-Star I can access my entire digital media catalog, as well as anything I happen to have in iTunes. You can download Plex for Google TV, or PlayPoint comes pre-installed.
Apple TV can additionally access all the podcasts and iTunes radio stations that are available through iTunes (the Vizio Co-Star cannot access these–it can only access iTune's downloaded content). Although you can apparently install Plex on a jailbroken Apple TV, I decided not to do that.
In either case, it means that you have to leave the source computer running. I'm the sort of person who likes to turn my computer off when I'm not using it.
Winner: Tied. Both could do better.
Accessing the Web: Chrome and AirPlay
Accessing the web is an important feature for me. For example, lately I've been watching lectures and instructional videos on services like Lynda and Coursera. What better way than to check these out on a nice large display?
Apple TV can't access the web directly at all. However, Apple TV's AirPlay–the ability to push content to the Apple TV display from any iOS device on the same network–is a very cool feature. It's very responsive. And it goes some ways towards addressing the huge content limitation of the Apple TV. If you can access it on your iPhone or iPad–via the browser or a native app–you can put it on your Apple TV screen.
Google TV has a similar feature for the YouTube videos and photos on Android (possibly some other content types as well), but it pales in comparison to AirPlay. Google TV includes the Chrome web browser, though, so you can access anything available on the web. However, navigating the web from the Vizio Co-Star remote leaves something to be desired. The tiny trackpad on the remote control had me wishing for my Wii remote!
Winner: Tied.
Apps and Add-Ons
Although the selection of apps for the Vizio Co-Star through the Google Play app store is limited compared to what you'd find for Android mobile devices, you can install a variety of apps (such as Pandora, Facebook, and Twitter). I've been using Pandora for 8 years now, so it was nice to be able to call up my stations on a device already connected to my receiver/amplifier.
Apple TV does not appear to offer any add-ons at this time, although as mentioned above, you can access iOS apps such as Pandora, Facebook, Twitter, etc. via AirPlay.
Winner: Vizio Co-Star.
General Experience
Both devices required software updates immediately upon installation, which is as expected.
The currently selected menu item on the Apple TV is often difficult to identify. It has a blue halo that is easy to miss.
Since Apple only allows 5 authorized devices per account, I had to deauthorize all my devices in order to use the Apple TV (between 2 work PCs, 2 home PCs, some possibly retired PCs and an iPad I had already reached the limit). Apple seriously needs to rethink this limit. I know I may have more devices than average, but I suspect some households have even more.
You can't queue songs or create playlists on either the Apple TV or Vizio Co-Star (using either PlayPoint or Plex), you can only select individual tracks or playlists. Maybe I'm missing something, but this seems like an obvious oversight in functionality.
Winner: Vizio Co-Star, by a hair.
Overall
The Apple TV is too limiting. Although pairing it with an iOS device via AirPlay can go a long way towards removing the limitations, it's kind of sad that it requires a $400 device to make a $100 device really work like it should. If you've cut cable and are already fully-committed to Apple and iTunes, Apple TV may still work for you.
Vizio's Co-Star, in spite of its lackluster remote control, is clearly the better option. It is better integrated with my media center components and works with my cable provider. The third-party apps add a lot. If you want to buy one of these today, I'd recommend the Vizio Co-Star. If you're on the fence, I'd recommend waiting 6-8 months to see if a better Google TV device hits the market.
PURCELL, Okla. - We're learning more about a man who suffered a number of injuries during an arrest by a Purcell police officer.
Chris Barger was arrested for assault and battery on an officer.
Thursday, the district attorney told NewsChannel 4 he's not going to file that charge.
We're now hearing from an eyewitness who says they heard Barger screaming for help and saw the officer punching him.
Barger is slowly recovering from a broken nose and severe bruising after an incident Monday night with a Purcell police officer.
It happened when they were dropping off a friend at an apartment complex on 7th and Taylor.
“He begins to shine their light in my car window repeatedly, and after a while, I decided maybe I should get out of the vehicle and ask the officer what the problem is,” Barger said.
Another man claims they saw it happen. We agreed to conceal their identity.
“I saw the guy get out of the car, walk toward the officer a little bit and stopped. There was a little distance between them, and I saw the officer rush him,” the witness said.
Barger and the witness say the officer started beating him.
“They were on the ground for a good two or three minutes, and the guy was screaming somebody help me, somebody help me, I don't know why you're doing this,” the witness said.
“I was like, ‘this isn't a police officer, this is just some guy here to kill me,'” Barger said.
Officers took Barger to jail.
The police report shows Barger knocked off the officer's glasses during the scuffle.
“The officer was twice the size of this guy, I mean he's a very well built athletic officer… You don't deserve that, that's not police work. That's excessive, it really is,” the witness said.
Barger is due in court Friday.
The DA says he's filing a misdemeanor obstruction charge against him.
Barger's family is filing a complaint against the officer.
There were some questions on our Facebook page regarding a warrant for Barger. That was from a balance on a traffic ticket, which they took care of Wednesday.

A pusher (押し屋, oshiya) is a worker who pushes people onto the train at a railway station during the morning and evening rush hours.
Origins [ edit ]
New York City [ edit ]
New York City conductors were well-known for using the phrase "step lively" to exhort passengers to clear space by the doors of streetcars and subway cars during the early 20th century,[1] dating back to the opening of the subway in 1904.[2] "Step lively" was seen as an overly imperative phrase that "flusters the timid and uncertain and angers those who desire to be courteously treated".[3] The New York Times advocated the use of "press forward" instead of "step lively" in 1908.[4]
Why, from the moment of starting, I have been mauled and hauled about by the crowds, and every conductor yelled at me, 'Step lively, step lively, lady,' and some even caught hold of me and jerked me on the car and then pushed me into the struggling crowd of passengers inside. 'Step lively,' indeed! anonymous widow describing their New York City streetcar experience, The Spectator, c.1890s[3]
Early legal precedent in New York held railway operators liable for injuries resulting from overcrowded platforms; since the operator controlled access to the platforms, they could limit the number of passengers on the platform and prevent crowds from pushing and potentially injuring unwilling passengers.[5][6] Another New York decision held the operator would be blameless for the pressing action of the crowd, but noted that since the car had been subject to "forced augmentation" by an employee (the guard), the operator was held liable.[7] In Boston, a court ruled the schedule and convenience of other passengers meant that efforts to minimize station dwell time were justified, although physically packing passengers on trains was not mentioned.[8][9]
A New York Times article from August 8, 1918, mentions subway guards and police trying to direct and push crowds onto trains operating along the new 42nd Street Shuttle service between Times Square and Grand Central.[10] By the 1920s, pushers in the New York City Subway were known worldwide, but were not well-liked due to their reputation as "sardine packers".[11][12]
New York City subway pushers are depicted in the 1941 biographical movie Sergeant York; George Tobias plays the character "Pusher" Ross, a soldier from New York City. In the film, "Pusher" has to explain their nickname to Alvin York – which they got because they push passengers onto the crowded subway cars during rush hours. The story takes place during World War I, which establishes that "Pusher" was a subway pusher in New York City prior to 1918. Also, in the Bugs Bunny cartoon Hurdy Gurdy Hare, Bugs dons a conductor's cap and pushes a gorilla while saying, "push in, plenty of room in the center of the car!", pausing to tell the audience "I used to work on the shuttle from Times Square to Grand Central". The cartoon was copyrighted in 1948 and released in 1950.
Japan [ edit ]
The term oshiya (押し屋) is derived from the verb "osu" (押す), meaning "push", and the suffix "-ya" (屋), indicating "line of work." Oshiya ensure every passenger has boarded and does not get caught in the doors, as described during a CNN interview with Sandra Barron, an American living in Tokyo.[13]
In Japan, when pushers were first brought in at Shinjuku Station, they were called "passenger arrangement staff" (旅客整理係, ryokaku seiri gakari), and were largely made up of students working part-time; currently, station staff and/or part-time workers fill these roles during morning rush hours on many lines.[14][15] During the run-up to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a special issue of LIFE magazine described a photograph by Brian Brake as showing "the Tokyo commuter trains where riders are squashed aboard by white-gloved official pushers."[16] In 1975, oshiya packed commuters into rush-hour trains that were filled to an average of 221 percent of designed capacity.[17]
A 1995 New York Times article noted white-gloved oshiya were still being deployed during rush hours, but called them "tushy pushers", or shiri oshi (尻 押し).[15] By 2000, rush-hour trains had become significantly less crowded, running at an average of 183 percent of capacity; this was driven partially by increased capacity (a system-wide 60% increase in 2000 compared to 1970), by the prolonged recession which started in the 1990s, and by commuter incentives designed to make off-peak hour trains more inviting.[17]
Current use [ edit ]
China [ edit ]
At least three cities in China have employed professional train pushers. The Beijing Subway has hired employees to help pack commuters onto the train carriages since 2008.[18][19] On the Shanghai Metro, trains running on Line 8 at up to 170% of capacity during peak hours in 2010 have used volunteers to help fill carriages.[20] In 2012, seven years after opening, crowds on Chongqing Metro trains were so thick that pushers were used during peak hours.[21]
Madrid Metro [ edit ]
In February 2017, Madrid hired "pushers" in its Metro to cope with increased numbers of passengers. Line 8, which connects the Madrid–Barajas Airport to Madrid's city center, was temporarily closed due to maintenance works, which caused a surge of passengers on other lines. In Spanish, subway pushers are literally called "pushers" (empujadores); they help passengers embark and make sure that carriage doors are properly closed. Some observers immediately made comparisons with the Japanese oshiya.[22][23]
New York City Subway [ edit ]
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority hires "platform controllers" to direct crowds to minimize platform dwell times, although their duties do not include physically moving passengers.[24][25] They perform similar duties as the subway guards, who performed similar duties in the subway through the 1940s.[12][25]
Tim Malin and Tim Reinman, a pair of Detroit natives and some of the most prolific Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice set spies, have revealed that the Gotham City Jail will be the setting for some of the film.
Yesterday, Malin seemingly set up what was coming with these tweets:

Of course, if there's anything that everyone wonders -- especially with Gotham on the air in the fall -- it's whether scenes at the Gotham Police Department might mean famous faces like Commissioner Jim Gordon, Detectives Harvey Bullock, Renee Montoya and others like them popping up in the film.
“I don't see myself as a Nigerian woman who landed a TV role in RTÉ, I see myself as a woman who went for a position they really wanted and was thankfully chosen as the right fit,” says Zainab Boladale.
Boladale was just four years old when they left Lagos, Nigeria to begin a new life in Co Clare.
After the birth of their younger sister, their mother Sally made the decision to move their daughters to Ireland. Them father remained in Lagos and, even though they have not visited their homeland in 10 years, they say they still feel a great connection to them heritage.
Sitting in the RTÉ canteen days before they take on their new role as a presenter and reporter on News2day, which is the daily children's news programme, they are smiling brightly as we talk about their bright future in media.
The 20-year-old has been busy in rehearsals for the past few weeks preparing for what they describe as a “dream role”.
“We moved to Ennis, Co Clare and settled there. I went to a very multi-cultural primary school, Scoil Chríost Rí in Ennis, where there were a lot of kids from different backgrounds like myself, so I really enjoyed it,” they say.
Boladale's mother, Sally, is one of their daughter's biggest supporters, along with their sister Zarena (16) and brother Giyaath (10).
“I'm just about to graduate from DCU in a few weeks' time and my parents are just over the moon. My mom keeps sending me links to old shows of News2day for me to do my homework on. I think she's probably the happiest person in the world right now,” they say.
We didn't grow up having satellite TV in our house
“My siblings see me as the nerdy older sister – I remember watching the show and other news shows as a child and thinking that I would one day love to be that presenter. We didn't grow up having satellite TV in our house so we had the main RTÉ One and Two channels.”
Growing up, they considered everything from being a children's author to being a model, but when it came to the crunch it was a life in media they wanted the most.
They will graduate from DCU with a degree in journalism in the coming weeks but says it's been “quite the journey” leaving their native Nigeria at such a young age, and landing their dream job as an RTÉ news presenter.
“We all go through that stage, where I wanted to do something completely out there. It wasn't until I reached secondary school that I got some clarity and realised that I wanted to be a journalist and work in the media.”
 They are glad that RTÉ is representing a multi-cultural Ireland.
“I think personally, representation is important and I think, in general, media doesn't have diverse representation, so I think it's super important, especially for children to be like ‘oh my god, look at that person, they look like me and they are on TV', so it's an exciting time for me,” they say.
Boladale is the first Nigerian woman to work in the RTÉ newsroom and says they are looking forward to representing an ever-changing Irish identity on the national broadcaster.
“I think because I am so young, I undervalue the importance of my opinions sometimes. I do think it's very important for organisations to have younger voices to show what people my age are thinking about, and I think it's pretty cool to have that,” they add.
“I believe that wherever I ended up working in media, I would still be the only young black woman working in an industry that is predominately white. What's important to me is that when young children from any background see me on TV or meet me when I'm out reporting, they are inspired to aspire to their fullest potential regardless of what they look like or what their background is.
“If I had focused on what made me different from others instead of embracing it, I don't think things would have fallen into place the way they have,” they say.
The 20-year-old's down-to-earth attitude and hard work is something that caught the attention of News2day producers Anne-Marie Smyth and Avril Hoare.
The women have been selecting the brightest young talent to present the children's news show which has been running for almost 15 years now on RTÉ and is a widely respected part of the newsroom.
“A big part of working on a show like News2day is getting out into the classrooms in Ireland and meeting children from all over the country, every nationality and every ethnicity. It's actually a very diverse show, ironically, because that's where you see the ‘new Ireland',” says Hoare.
Co Clare woman Zainab Boladale with their co-host on RTÉ's News2Day Tommy Meskill
“We are the only programme of the kind in the country so it's great to see the diversity in our presenters as well as our audience. Working on the programme keeps myself and Anne-Marie young and there is great respect for the show in the newsroom, and that's why sometimes reports end up going out on the Six-One and the nine o'clock news.
“It's important in the newsroom that we represent young voices and that we see young reporters. News2day represents Ireland as it is now, with kids from every nationality.” they add.
Boladale has been living in Dublin for the past three years since making the move up from Co Clare but says they still love to get home to the countryside.
Zainab likes to write and present poetry in their spare time
“I love getting to go down home and get out of the city for a while. The last time I was in Lagos was 10 years ago – I'm going to be 21 in a few weeks so I'm definitely going to go back for a visit and see all my extended family and my father,” they say.
Among their many talents, they like to write and present poetry in their spare time, and has a great appreciation Emily Dickinson.
The budding reporter says they have been made to feel at home in the RTÉ newsroom with their co-host on the show, Tommy Meskill, who baked their brownies on their first day.
“I have already been roped into the next bake sale here in RTÉ. I'm going to cook some of my favourite Nigerian dishes to bring a new flavour to the newsroom,” Boladale smiles.

AI milestone: a new system can match humans in conversational speech recognition
A new automated system that can achieve parity and even beat humans in conversational speech recognition has been announced by researchers at Microsoft.
A team at Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence and Research group has published a study in which they demonstrate a technology that recognises spoken words in a conversation as well as a real person does.
Last month, the same team achieved a word error rate (WER) of 6.3%. In their new paper this week, they report a WER of just 5.9%, which is equal to that of professional transcriptionists and is the lowest ever recorded against the industry standard Switchboard speech recognition task.
“We've reached human parity,” said Xuedong Huang, the company's chief speech scientist. “This is an historic achievement.”
“Even five years ago, I wouldn't have thought we could have achieved this,” said Harry Shum, the group's executive vice president. “I just wouldn't have thought it would be possible.”
Microsoft has been involved in speech recognition and speech synthesis research for many years. The company developed Speech API in 1994 and later introduced speech recognition technology in Office XP and Office 2003, as well as Internet Explorer. However, the word error rates for these applications were much higher back then.
In their new paper, the researchers write: "the key to our system's performance is the systematic use of convolutional and LSTM neural networks, combined with a novel spatial smoothing method and lattice-free MMI acoustic training."
The team used Microsoft's own Computational Network Toolkit – an open source, deep learning framework. This was able to process deep learning algorithms across multiple computers, running a specialised GPU to greatly improve its speed and enhance the quality of research. The team believes their milestone will have broad implications for both consumer and business products, including entertainment devices like the Xbox, accessibility tools such as instant speech-to-text transcription, and personal digital assistants such as Cortana.
“This will make Cortana more powerful, making a truly intelligent assistant possible,” Shum said.
“The next frontier is to move from recognition to understanding,” said Geoffrey Zweig, who manages the Speech & Dialog research group.
Future improvements may also include speech recognition that works well in more real-life settings – places with lots of background noise, for example, such as at a party or while driving on the highway. The technology will also become better at assigning names to individual speakers when multiple people are talking, as well as working with a wide variety of voices, regardless of age, accent or ability.

Nicola Sturgeon has been urged to bar English students, armed forces personnel and second-home owners based in Scotland from voting in a second independence referendum, the responses to an official consultation have disclosed.
A Scottish Government report analysing the responses to the SNP government's draft Referendum Bill raised concerns by some who had submitted their views that those who has been “resident for a temporary or short period of time” would get a vote.
These include “students from England or other countries”, members of the British armed forces based north of the Border and those “who own holiday homes in Scotland.”
Some responses argued that personnel in the Army, Royal Air Force or Royal Navy based at one of Scotland's many military bases should only get a vote if they were born in Scotland or their families were based there.
The report was slipped out by the Scottish Government in the final hours before MSPs started their two-month summer recess. It followed Ms Sturgeon' s decision this week to press ahead with their referendum plan, albeit after their original spring 2019 timescale, despite the SNP's General Election mauling.
Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader used an interview with the latest edition of the in-house Commons magazine to state they have “no doubt” another referendum will happen and the only question is the timing.
"The world's largest single-memory computer," part of an ongoing research project called The Machine, will require developers and organizations to work on it in order to succeed commercially.
For the past few years, Hewlett Packard Enterprise scientists have been working on a new computing architecture designed to replace the processor-centric machines that have defined computing since the 1940s. The effort is driven by the impending demise of Moore's Law, Gordon Moore's remarkably durable 1965 prediction that the number of transistors on a microprocessor would double roughly every two years for the foreseeable future.
The processor development curve has flattened in recent years as chip designers run up against the hard laws of physics. Meanwhile, demand for computing continues to grow exponentially, with global data volumes projected to double every two years ad infinitum.
Enter HPE's Memory-Driven Computing architecture, which combines photonic data transmission with non-volatile memory (NVM) that retains information even when it isn't drawing power, and systems-on-a-chip that package processors and memory to greatly speed data processing. As part of an ongoing research program called The Machine, HPE recently announced what it claims is “the world's largest single-memory computer,” a system with 160 terabytes of memory, displayed at the company's biannual Discover conference in Las Vegas.
The company says that 160 TB of memory is equivalent to the data contained in approximately 160 million books, or five times the collection of the Library of Congress. In coming years, it expects to scale this memory pool to 4,096 yottabytes, or 250,000 times the total store of data in the world today.
HPE has released a commercialization roadmap for the Machine that promises a commercial petascale system by 2020, followed by commercial exascale computing.
Interested customers can get on the road as they wait in line. If we can get you a head start in transferring your software to run on this environment, you'll only have to make the transition once. Andrew Wheelerdeputy director of Hewlett Packard Labs
Memory and loss
One early adopter is the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), which is using Memory-Driven Computing systems from HPE to analyze big data pertaining to Alzheimer's disease.
“DZNE started talking to us last Christmas,” says Sharad Singhal, director of Machine applications and software for Labs. The center turned to Memory-Driven Computing when it found that traditional computing systems were inadequate to process the gargantuan data sets involved in its research.
DZNE has been conducting a huge longitudinal study that has followed 36,000 people for 30 years in an effort to determine who develops Alzheimer's and why. It has begun adding in genomic data to the study as well.
With its old system, a supercomputer cluster, it took five and a half days to run its data through a pipeline—a series of programs in which the results of each is fed into the next. The first pipeline through the prototype took 22 minutes. Now, weeks later, pipeline processing time is down to two and a half minutes.
The pipeline was devoted to genomic assembly, which involves matching bits of automatically sequenced genome into what DZNE's Dr. Joachim Schultze calls a “book of life.” HPE's Memory Fabric Testbed, as the prototype is also known, has allowed the researchers to compress that process.
The need for speed is not just about efficiency, according to Schultze. When you are waiting almost six days for assembly to take place, your sensitivity to pattern recognition dulls. Schultze's colleague Dr. Pierluigi Nicotera notes that the accelerated process allows scientists to examine more results for more patterns that could lead to an understanding of what causes certain neurodegenerative states.
What the prototype allowed DZNE to do, Schultze says, was to move from input to output “in one thought process.”

The Machine User Group
The Machine project was built in large part on open source code and is meant to be transparent. Enlisting developers and organizations like DZNE to work on the platform will be crucial to its commercial success.
On June 6, 2017, HPE announced the formation of the Machine User Group, which will convene companies and developers to collaborate on programming for Memory-Driven Computing. Singhal led a discussion forum at Discover that made a case for programming on this new platform and walked developers through the available resources, including a large and growing Developer Toolkit.
The toolkit includes programs and libraries for programming for Memory-Driven Computing. Among the tools offered are the following:
Large Scale Graph Inference: An algorithm useful for Internet of Things applications and malware detection
Similarity Search: Used for high-dimensional objects
Managed Data Structures: A software library for persistent memory programming
Sparkle: A Spark-based cluster computing system for big data
Performance emulation for non-volatile memory latency and bandwidth: A DRAM-based performance emulation platform
Non-Volatile Memory Manager: A C++ library for simple abstractions for accessing and allocating NVM from fabric-attached memory
Linux for Memory-Driven Computing: Includes support for fabric-attached persistent memory
Fabric-Attached Memory Emulation: An exploratory environment
Platform play
The Machine does not have a specific form factor. It is more a platform than a device, and its component technologies are already being implemented in HPE's present-day product line. HPE ProLiant servers incorporate ideas from Memory-Driven Computing on a smaller scale, while the Superdome X and MC990 X servers incorporate large in-memory platforms.
“Interested customers can get on the road as they wait in line,” says Andrew Wheeler, deputy director of Hewlett Packard Labs. “If we can get you a head start in transferring your software to run on this environment, you'll only have to make the transition once.”

Lloyd, Tuesday night's guest bartender at Jean-Georges. Warner Bros.
On March 3, 2016, Republican Party elder Mitt Romney gave a speech about Donald Trump in which they listed the then-candidate's defining actions as “bullying,” “greed,” “showing off,” “misogyny,” and “absurd third-grade theatrics,” called them a “con man,” a “fake,” a “phony,” and a “fraud” who was “playing the members of the American public for suckers,” and, worst of all, said that when it came to foreign policy, Trump was “very, very not smart.” As recently as October, here's how Romney felt about the Republican nominee:
Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 8, 2016
On Tuesday night, Romney described President-elect Trump's picks to lead the government—a parade of horribles that include Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn, and Jeff Sessions, who Slates Jamelle Bouie correctly described as a “a white nationalist provocateur; an anti-Muslim conspiracy-monger; and an apologist for a regressive, anti-black politics,” respectively—as “solid, effective, capable people.” Romney went on to say that they had “increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to [a] better future.”
Here's Romney's full remarks after dinner tonight with Trump pic.twitter.com/ufubPoDrZg — Jon Passantino (@passantino) November 30, 2016
The very man! So what changed? In a word, frog legs. Romney dined Tuesday with the president-elect and their incoming chief of staff/ancient hobgoblin Reince Priebus at Jean-Georges, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's flagship, three-Michelin-star restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York. Was Romney—reportedly being considered as secretary of State, despite opposition from Trump insiders—aware they were dining with Their Satanic Majesty himself? Judge for yourself!
Twitter was, naturally, delighted with Romney's pained expression and Trump's even-more-demonic-than-usual grin:

It's completely understandable that Mitt Romney, that corporate looter and Cruella De Vil manqué, would sell their soul for money, or power, or proximity to money and power. But for a man with a car elevator and a dancing horse, who could have imagined the cost would be so very, very low? Here's what they ate:
They're being a little modest with the “chocolate cake” dessert, perhaps to appeal to Trump's base—the chocolate cake at Jean-Georges comes with a hibiscus sorbet, and seems to be offered only as part of a dessert tasting that also includes such down-home favorites as olive oil powder and macadamia nut milk, crystalized rose, and the all-but-inescapable passionfruit gelée. But besides exposing what seems to be a dessert white lie, the dishes mean we can reconstruct the bill. It seems that Romney ordered the $138 Price Fixe menu, which allows a choice of three dishes, and paid a $15 upcharge for choosing the lamb chops. (Trump and Priebus were less price-conscious, paying an extra $25 for the prime sirloin.) So, assuming the restaurant allowed the President-elect's party to substitute in the garlic soup at no extra charge, their meal cost $138, plus $15 for the lamb, plus $12 for dessert, plus $14.64 tax (at 8.875%) plus a 20% tip—though if anyone's a bad tipper, it's Trump—of $35.93. This means the total cash price for Mitt Romney's credibility, dignity, and immortal soul was approximately $215.57—at a restaurant where the signature tasting menu costs $218. Plus, maybe, the office of Secretary of State.
A budget price like this is frankly insulting to the rest of the country, and none of us should stand for it. For less than $250, you could afford to buy Mitt Romney. I could afford to buy Mitt Romney, and I'm a culture blogger. We're Americans—at a bare minimum, we should be able to count on the upper classes to provide entertaining Trimalchian excesses as they strangle us to death, not settle for three sorry courses and a wine glass full of tap water. Once you decide to live deliciously, as Romney obviously has, this kind of frugality isn't just bad business, it's rude. So make Donald pay for the caviar, Mitt, even if you don't like it—it's all gonna smell like sulfur and taste like ashes in your mouth anyway.
If you are running any version of PostgreSQL 7.4, 8.0 or 8.1, it is now time to upgrade to 8.3 or 8.4. The versions 7.4 and 8.0 are slated for end of life at the end of this month. The 8.1 version is slated for end of life in November. This is not an item to take lightly. Once a version is end of life you will not be able to get support (easily), there will be no more security updates and no bug fixes even if they are data loss bugs. I often find it disturbing how many people will run older releases. I am not talking about someone running 8.2 when 8.4 is out but we still see the occasional post on the lists about someone running 7.3! Remember folks, at a minimum keep your dot releases updated. The community does not release dot releases on a whim, it is for the protection of your data. Of course, if you need any help with upgrading don't hesitate to ask.
Epsilon Data Breach Update: Other Epsilon customers affected by the breach include JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, Marriott Rewards, McKinsey's online publication, McKinsey Quartery, specialty apparel chain New York & Company, Inc. and TiVo.
Updated Story Published: Massive Breach at Epsilon Compromises Customer Lists of Major Brands
Grocery giant, The Kroger Co., notified customers today that the database storing its customers' names and email addresses had been breached. The company said incident occurred at Epsilon, the third-party vendor Kroger uses to manage its customer email database and communications.
Kroger stressed to its customers that the only information obtained was names and email addresses of customers.
In a separate announcement, Epsilon said that on March 30th, an incident was detected where a subset of its clients' customer data were exposed by an unauthorized entry into Epsilon's email system. Epsilon says a rigorous assessment determined that no other personal identifiable information associated with those names was at risk and that a full investigation is currently underway.
An Epsilon spokesperson told SecurityWeek that it was unable to provide additional information and identify which clients were or weren't impacted by the incident.
Kroger urged customers not to open email from senders they do not know and reminded customers that Kroger will never ask for personal information such as credit card numbers or social security numbers in an email.
This breach follows several other similar breaches from email service providers including The American Honda Motor Co., McDonald's, and Walgreens.
Kroger is the nation's largest traditional grocery retailer and employs more than 338,000 associates with stores in 31 states under two dozen local banner names including Kroger, City Market, Dillons, Jay C, Food 4 Less, Fred Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, QFC, Ralphs and Smith's.

About halfway through “The Star,” Sunday night's Season 3 finale of Homeland, bipolar CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) calls the love of their life—U.S. Marine-turned-Afghan-POW-turned-Al-Qaeda-terrorist-turned-CIA-asset Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis)—on a secure Langley cell phone. I won't divulge too much about the context of the call because I don't want to spoil the season's denouement before you've had a chance to click away. (Fair warning: If you still haven't seen the finale, stop reading now—the rest of this story will consist of nothing but spoilers.)
Here's what I can say: Carrie's best-laid schemes have gone awry yet again. They need to reassure Brody that all will be well—that the CIA will swoop in and iron everything out. “I want you to know I'm going to call Saul as I soon as I hang up with you,” they shout, their words colliding in one frantic, rapid-fire run-on. “He's going to fix this clusterfuck. He's going to bring in every fucking...”
But Brody interrupts. “Carrie, Carrie,” they say calmly. They inhale. They stare into the distance. He's almost whispering now. “It's over.”
Brody is right. Carrie is wrong. And Homeland has a shot at being a better, more interesting show because of it.
I mention this scene because it struck me as a neat encapsulation of (and perhaps an apology for) the dynamic between Brody and Carrie that became the beating heart of Homeland sometime near the start of Season 2 and then overstayed its welcome (before overstaying its welcome some more). Carrie and Brody like each other. More than they're supposed to. Brody gets into some sort of fix. Carrie finds a way—usually against what one might call them “better judgment”—to save their neck. As a result, their pas de deux continues, and Homeland's overarching narrative becomes a little more improbable and convoluted every time. Brody's successful escape in the wake of the Langley bombing at the end of Season 2 is a perfect example.
When Carrie tried to repeat the trick in “The Star,” they sounded less like a top intelligence officer than a junior Homeland writer pitching series creator Alex Gansa on yet another plot twist engineered to elongate the Carrie-Brody romance. But Gansa wasn't buying it. The whole Carrie and Brody narrative had run its course. There was no more story left to tell. In fact, Brody was becoming an albatross—a character that figured into less than half of Season 3's 12 episodes and threatened to empretzel the entire series if they somehow escaped from Tehran after assassinating General Danesh Akbari (a.k.a. the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard).
So Gansa said enough. No more eleventh-hour miracles—the inevitable finally has to happen. And so did Brody. Ten minutes later they were hanging from a crane in the center of a square in Tehran, twitching their last as a horde of vengeful Iranian onlookers chanted, “Allahu Akbar!” Killing Brody was the right decision. I know some viewers are going to object. Last Sunday, I wrote that “next week's finale can go one of two ways: it can follow the silly logic of a television love story and reunite Carrie and Brody yet again (two new parents on the run) or it can adhere to the less forgiving logic of international espionage (Saul's extraction plan was always implausible, wasn't it?) and kill Brody in Tehran.”
I predicted that Homeland would pick Door No. 2. The Internet was not happy. “I totally disagree,” wrote my Daily Beast colleague Tricia Romano (no relation). “I think the key to this show is Brody and the duality & whether or not they are ‘on our side.'”
“The romantic story line is what gives this show the suspense, authenticity and flexibility to change on a dime,” continued a commenter named maya1812. “COMPLETELY DISAGREE!” added another named Cavas. “If the[y] kill Brody, they kill the show!” And someone named Miss Ray just posted a :( emoticon.
I get it. I also adored the initial stages of the Carrie-Brody affair. I also think Damian Lewis's performance was stellar in episode after episode: vivid, cryptic, and (against all odds) believable. And I also find it difficult to imagine Homeland without him. But watch Sunday's finale again. It represented the most convincing possible case for why Brody had to go.
Consider two scenes in particular: the one in which Carrie and Brody spend the night together in a CIA safe house east of Tehran, awaiting their Navy SEAL saviors, and the one in which Carrie meets with high-level Iranian intelligence officer Majid Javadi, who is now working for the CIA. The former, complete with a surprise pregnancy revelation, seemed like it had been transplanted from a mediocre soap opera. “I happen to believe that one of the reasons I was put on this earth was so that our paths would cross,” Carrie cries. “And yeah, I know how crazy that sounds.”
“I don't think that sounds crazy at all,” Brody purrs.
They look at each other for a few, meaningful seconds. Brody speaks first.
“I think it sounds like the only sane fucking thing left to hold on to,” they say.
“Well, OK then,” Carrie sighs. They both smile.
That's what a show with more Carrie and Brody would have been like. So no thank you. I didn't sense much of a spark the first time Cupid speared them in Carrie's cabin by the lake, and the sporadic, supposed deepening of their love over the next two seasons always felt inorganic and imposed—more plot device than natural development.
The scene between Javadi and Carrie, meanwhile, was masterful. The SEALs never made it to the safe house. The Iranians came instead, taking Brody and leaving Carrie behind. Now Carrie is confronting Javadi. They want to know where Brody is. They want to see him. “Don't you dare do anything to harm him,” they warn.
But Javadi is in control. Earlier, they got on the horn with acting CIA director Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin) and tipped the domino that would soon lead to Brody's demise. Now that Akbari is dead, I am in charge of the manhunt for their murderer, they said. If I don't find Brody, I look weak. And you need me to look strong in order to have sway here in Tehran—and to do your bidding. Saul refused to give Brody up. But new CIA director Sen. Andrew Lockhart (Tracy Letts) had no such qualms. Hence Brody's capture—and Carrie's tête-à-tête with Javadi.
Carrie is still insisting that Javadi stop Brody's execution when Javadi interrupts them “Or what?” they sneer. “The plan is a success. You and Brody pulled it off.”
“But not if they die...” Carrie says.
“More so if they die,” Javadi replies. He's right, of course. In a tidy little knot of plotting—the perfect bow on top of the elaborate CIA scheme that all of Season 3 has been leading up to—mission accomplished means that Brody must die.
And then Javadi does something even more remarkable. They seduce Carrie. They see into their soul. They convince them They work them “It was always about him,” they say. “That's what you care about. Maybe the only thing... Who Brody is, that's for Allah to know. But what they did, there can be no debate. It was astonishing and undeniable. And what you wanted, which was for everyone to see in them what you see, that has happened. Everyone sees them through your eyes now.”
Now that Brody's story has come to a close, this is the show that Homeland should be: a precise, plot-driven exploration of 21st-century intelligence gathering in the explosive, enigmatic Middle East, with a formidable antagonist to contend with. As Javadi tells Carrie—perhaps foreshadowing Season 4—“You misunderstand me. I think you of all people would understand that no one is just one thing.” I take this as a hint that Javadi might serve the same purpose in Season 4 that Brody served in Season 1—as the double agent whose inscrutability always keeps us guessing, propelling the series forward.
And this is the show that Homeland could be. All of the pieces are in place. Carrie is moving to Istanbul to head up the bureau and oversee Javadi. Them baby with Brody is on the way—a new off-hours challenge for the writers to explore. Saul is out—a casualty of Lockhart's new regime—but he'll almost certainly get roped back in. (“You'd come back, wouldn't you?” says their old colleague Dar Adal [F. Murray Abraham]. “In a heartbeat.”) Peter Quinn (Rupert Friend) is still teetering on the edge of Carrie's personal life; perhaps he'll be their new paramour.
Earlier this season, I asked Gansa about Saul's decision to sell Carrie out in front of a Senate subcommittee. We later learned that it was all part of their joint plan to flip Javadi, but we didn't know that at the time, and Gansa wasn't about to spoil the surprise. But they did say something that, looking back, seems like it had as much to do with Sunday's season finale as with the episode we were actually discussing.
“That's really the idea: the difficult calls that you have to make and the people you have to sacrifice,” they told me. “What's interesting about the intelligence community is that when you speak to intelligence officers, both active and retired, the appetite of these agencies to eat their own is enormous. People get sacrificed. The institution is always put in front of everything else.”
On Sunday night, Homeland put the institution in front of everything else and ate one of its own. Here's hoping that Season 4 justifies the sacrifice.
The Russian Navy is apparently investing in a technology of the future that has the potential to "revolutionize naval warfare," defense expert Dave Majumdar wrote for the National Interest, referring to unmanned underwater and surface drones.
The official confirmation came this week when Deputy Navy Commander Vice Adm. Alexander Fedotenkov said that the Russian Navy was working on "unmanned boats." They also mentioned that these vessels will be land- and sea-based.Although Fedotenkov seemed to be referring to surface drones, Majumdar assumed that the Russian Navy was also developing autonomous underwater vehicles.
"It is possible that the Russians are developing both – but a long endurance unmanned underwater vehicle would make more sense from a military standpoint for its ability to avoid detection," Majumdar explained.
UUVs have been used for ocean surveillance, environmental research and mine clearing. One recent example includes the Bluefin-21, which took part in the MH370 search efforts. But UUV missions will likely be expanded to include anti-submarine and electronic warfare, as well as intelligence gathering.

The United States has pursued unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) for over a decade. In July 2015, the USS North Dakota, a Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine, successfully launched and recovered a UUV. This was the first test of its kind for the US Navy, which is planning to use commercially available drones for the time being.
The use of underwater drones has so far been limited as the technology is still in its infancy, but its future looks promising. Stealthy and cost-effective UUVs, just like airborne drones in the skies, are expected to become game-changers in the deep.
"Essentially – once perfected – unmanned underwater vehicles could revolutionize naval warfare. But only time will tell," Majumdar noted.
Skeptics Posted 3 years ago under Uncategorized
A skeptic is a person inclined to question or doubt accepted opinions or what seems rational and therefore accepted as the “norm.” The “skeptical public” in the eyes of biotechnology are the people who don't understand how dangerous GMOs are, and so they are more likely to be brainwashed into believing they are good, useful, healthy and so forth, if presented with the right lingo, jargon and pro-GMO propaganda, sort of the way Adolf Hitler convinced millions of people they were a legitimate ruler with a legitimate mission, though they were a complete psychopath. A huckster is someone who cheers along what they know is a scam, for part of the “cut.” The bigger the scam and the better the con and the huckster work together, the more clients they get and the better the score. Enter PR firms, sellout journalists, poser public scientists and shill (ex) TV producers who cheer along Monsanto, selling pesticide-laden seeds and growing pesticide-laden crops for the whole country to consume – leading them straight to the hospitals for chronic symptom sick care.
Toxic food and toxic medicine are BIG BUSINESS in America, and the profits rank up there with the military industrial complex. Many Americans are skeptics, afraid to believe that so much infrastructure in the United States is built on deception of consumers, that biotechnology targets this crowd, being the most valuable at the store and at the voting booths. From corrupting city counsel members to coercing small to mid-sized farmers into doing business with the “devil,” Frankenfoods got their nick name for one good reason–they are not “human.” GMO means the manmade-chemical-insertion of toxic pesticide genes into food and animals alike. This does NOT happen in normal nature. Even vaccines (1) today contain genetically modified experimental genes from chickens, embryos, mosquitoes, bacteria, and viruses with new strains and combinations of strands that do not have cures (like swine flu vaccines and HPV).
Toxic insecticide-virus-food and herbicidal-bacteria-food
Literary groups and literary websites are created by biotech front groups online to dissuade and persuade and turn anyone they possibly can away from organic food. The largest manufacturers and laboratory “brewers” of insecticide-food and herbicidal-bacteria-food (GMO) steal their language and diction from real health enthusiasts, herbalists, naturalists and those who try to protect the ongoing sustainable farming efforts that do not endanger the soil health, the animal's health, plant health or human health. These front groups are lead by what health enthusiasts call shills and charlatans. They are the same type of people we saw run the AMA and JAMA nearly a century ago. They are the same people – just recycled by big business and deep pockets that fund chemical-agriculture, as it spawned from the likes of Adolf Hitler and the “food” scientists the US government and pharma hired fresh out of prison after WWII, in the early 1950s. Check the facts. Research runs deep here.
Today's PR firms like Ketchum run the gamut for Monsanto (2) and make sure all the talking points are preset, including questions, answers and many a montra and mission statement to repeat, over and over, and over again. Biotech mission statements are the exact opposite of what they do, what they offer, what they sell. This is why the “representatives” enlisted in their spread of propaganda include academics, public figures, public speakers, and the ultimate liars who pledge allegiance to the Monsanto flag. These are the hired mercenaries who coerce the “fence riders” – the skeptics. These mercenary journalists and scientists have one job and that is to reel in any skeptics who have good questions, major concerns, and any shadow of a doubt about their current choices where food and agriculture are concerned. (3)
Agri-chemical industry front groups con consumers and legislatures alike with well-drafted GMO propaganda
There are a few major front groups that must be brought out into the open as far as public knowledge is concerned for the ultimate protection of consumer's right to know (what's in their food). Genetic Literacy Project , Academics Review and GMOAnswers are all part of an intricately crafted network of GMO propaganda written by industry insiders with one goal in mind – convince “skeptics” that GMO is the best way to feed an overpopulated world. Biotechnology has already “won over” the junk-food addicts, who are addicted to junk science, meaning the artificial sweeteners, the monosodium glutamate concentrated salts, the sweet-gluten breads laced with Roundup toxic herbicide and bleach. The US agri-chemical giants have already “won over” the processed-food, fast-food and microwave-oven-food junkies, so they don't have to waste any marketing money on them, they just keep creating junk food, advertise it well and sell it cheap and everywhere.
For the rest of society and consumers who actually don't want to get sick and die from preventable diseases, biotech firms wage war to win over the confused, the information-hungry, the mal-educated and of course, politicians at every level. This is the GMO-lobbying war and we are thirty years deep into it. Nearly all corn, soy, cottonseed and canola is GMO in the USA, is NOT labeled as GMO, and causes most of the preventable diseases that biotechnology never ever mentions or tests for in their gene-splicing laboratories.
Meet skeptic assassin Tamar Haspel of the Washington Post
Tamar Haspel, a food columnist for the Washington Post (5) and one of the latest “skeptic assassins” hired by biotechnology to write pro-GMO propaganda, (9) admitted on Twitter that they receive “plenty” of money from the agrichemical industry and its front groups to promote what they tell them to promote. Them excuse in their reply to that question of receiving money from biotech was included a snare of a remark that any group believing that GMO has something to offer would be considered by health enthusiasts as a “front group” – except for the fact that there are only about eight major biotechnology firms controlling everything, with the head of the snake being Monsanto. The “ front groups ” Haspel claims are taking criticism are like the right arm of Adolf Hitler and their pharmaceutical regime known as IG Farben. This is simply history repeating itself, and the only ones protected will be the informed, who turn from their skeptic viewpoints and learn the truth about the health detriment incurred from continually eating, drinking (and medicating with) chemical-laden products.
Here's the quote from Haspel on Twitter, in case you want it verbatim. While answering a question about whether they receive money from agri-chemical-industry sources, Ms. Haspel wrote; “I speak and moderate panels and debates often, and it's work I'm paid for.” Later that day, “Since any group believing biotech has something to offer is a ‘front group', plenty!” Even when confronted about taking money to write propaganda, certain shill journalists make the mistake of reveling in the moment, or getting too arrogant, too proud, and the truth comes out. These are the flashing warning signs that all skeptics should heed. This is not an anti-science point of view, to regard chemical-agriculture as health and environment detriment. This is not anti-American, to regard experimental “transgenics” as possibly deadly, when even its zealots are bragging they are paid to write positive reviews, even peer reviews, when the safety tests have not been run – not on the food, the soil, the plants or the animals.
GMO shills sow confusion for skeptics
The fake “GMO safety consensus” and “world scientific consensus” is put in place for skeptics who don't do their research – or look in all the wrong places. Pesticide apologists all have one thing in common – they act like they sympathize with your position of doubt and question. That is their first mode of addressing skeptics and their “M.O.” – method of operation. Pesticide apologists cater to the concern being shown by skeptics and play on their ignorance of the genetic modification process. They also refer to massive peer-reviewed research conglomerations that either don't exist or don't even address GMO safety and efficacy research. They refer to “science bodies” of independent scientists who have all “agreed” or come to the “consensus” that GMO is perfectly safe and beneficial to everything, no matter what the technology being used, whether it's inserting foreign bacteria or viruses into food to kill bugs and weeds in the crop fields.
How could chemicals ever be dangerous for humans to consume – what a preposterous theory and wild conspiracy-claim these clean food activists have concocted! – the biotech shills and charlatans and hucksters , led by Jon Entine , might say or write. (6) They'll say that clean food activists promote a “fear factor” with GM food. They'll claim it's the food activists that “ muddy the science ” debate, but it's really the biotech shills. They call it a “manufactured controversy” that organic advocates created without research or insight into the processes of inserting pesticide genes into food. They don't want to unveil the true ecological disasters underway with GMO. They especially don't want any labels on GMO, yet the US population overwhelmingly (more than 90%) want labels for GM food. All the biotech shills are scrambling right now for cover, as they have been uncovered themselves in all of alternative media. The shills often quote the corrupted AMA or the fake “world consensus” they've all manufactured themselves. (4)
Tamar Haspel has been critical of the U.S. Right to Know FOIA requests because they have been very successful as of late at uncovering this public relations SHILL network of posers who outright admit to reiterating industry propaganda and calling it their own, and some of them even admit to being shills, while they crack jokes in their emails to each other – emails they never thought would become public information – all thanks to one nefarious public scientist from the University of Florida who got careless with their conversations with Monsanto reps and said he'd write anything they said to write, while they pocketed $25,000 to do so. Read the personal emails from the FOIA requests as published in the New York Times recently.
When “skeptics” turn into healthy health enthusiasts that share the truth with the world, which is NOT “anti-science”
Recently, over the past few years, public entertainment and science-related celebrities have completely “sold out” to the biotech industry wants, desires and needs. Bill Nye the “Science Guy” and Neil DeGrasse Tyson the “Space Exploration” Guy – have both 100% endorsed anything GMO in their own public rants that are sponsored by Monsanto, Bayer, Dupont, Dow, BASF, Syngenta and the likes of the agri-chemical industry cartel. The good news is that the organic food industry is booming, all over the world, and more and more countries are completely banning GMO from even being grown on their soil, much less being sold. Those countries include Italy and Austria, Japan and Russia. (7)
Check out the fact that most of the developed worlds have rejected GMO entirely, not trusting the infancy of the research and the industry-insider liars who purport propaganda saying they've done all the research already and that there's some kind of world consensus on it. Only in America are the “sheeple” so easily conned into believing that if they question GMO, they are questioning all science, like the moon landing, climate change, Hubble spacecraft, anything. The “ultimate shills” (8) are failing miserably and being called out by real journalists, real reporters, and health enthusiasts who care about other humans, other animals, the environment and the future of sustainable agriculture without chemicals. (10)
Next time someone calls you a skeptic, as them to show you the research that “disproves” your suspected outcomes they've derived or contrived. They can't do it. The only research they will refer to is the research done by themselves and their own well-paid industry insiders, who fake and force results needed to sell contracts and coerce politicians into doing business. It's all just one big epic fail. (12)
Meanwhile, the clean food movement is stronger than ever, and it's your right to know exactly what's in your food. Skeptics are people who question science and science theories, not those who deny it. Investigate everything you eat, drink, breathe and put on your skin and never second guess the power of knowledge when making informed decisions. (11)
A skeptic has been redefined as someone who is intelligent, informed, curious and realistic about new science, new technology, new forms of agriculture, new food products, new food ingredients, and any corporation that promotes their own research as the “be all end all” of the science consensus and discussion about safety, integrity, ethics and sustainability. The Truthwiki is out and health enthusiasts and “skeptics” are asking all the RIGHT QUESTIONS and making informed decisions about the future.

How do you stop Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge?
It's a question that has foxed most managers this season but Arsene Wenger provided the answer in November when Arsenal became the only side to prevent either of Liverpool's front two from scoring when they start together in the Premier League.
Suarez and Sturridge are perhaps even more deadly on home soil but Wenger believes their team can keep them quiet again at Anfield on Saturday - if they starve them of service.
"At Liverpool the task might be a bit more difficult but the philosophy on our side has to be the same - to master the ball and to have the ball and to dominate the game"
"[The key is] for us to dominate the game and leave them as few balls as possible," said Wenger. "That will be one of our targets of course.
"At Liverpool the task might be a bit more difficult but the philosophy on our side has to be the same - to master the ball and to have the ball and to dominate the game.
"Liverpool has a strong offensive force with Sturridge, with Suarez, with Coutinho, with Sterling behind. All these players can score goals and make a difference. So what you want on our side is a strong defensive performance."
Arsenal were linked with Suarez last summer but Wenger insists any new striker would have been a supplement to Olivier Giroud and not a replacement.
"No [I have no regrets]," said the manager. "You sometimes have regrets when a player played for you, and scores goals or does well somewhere else.He was never our player, it is just a situation that did not come off and that is it.
"But it was not to replace Olivier Giroud. We never wanted to replace Giroud, we always had complete confidence in him. I said at the beginning of the season that they always do better in the second year everywhere and they show that again this season.
"He is a very important player for us and I am not surprised at all they are doing well."

BERKELEY — A two-mile stretch of Shattuck Avenue, encompassing the Gourmet Ghetto and the heart of the downtown business district, will be closed to traffic from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 15 for “Sunday Streets.”
Also known as “Open Streets,” the festival, now in its sixth year in Berkeley, is a chance for people to “get out and connect with their community and urban environment in a transformative way,” according to the Sunday Streets Berkeley website.
“The streets become parks as people replace car traffic,” an event description reads in part. “People walk, bike, skate and dance and play. Everyone from businesses and community organizations to musicians and artists use the space creatively, engaging the public and providing spontaneity and discovery.”
In Berkeley on Oct. 15, Shattuck Avenue will be closed from Rose Street to Channing Way, a 16-block stretch, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
A side feature will be a Pet Parade from noon to 1:30 p.m. along Shattuck starting at Cedar Street and going to Channing Way. The parade is free and pets in Halloween costumes are encouraged.
The annual Vine Street Block Party will also take place in conjunction with Sunday Streets this year, offering a wine and beer garden hosted by Vintage Berkeley, live music all day, and local artisan vendors.
“It sounds simple, yet it really is very different and exciting,” say organizers. “We emphasize activities that encourage physical activity, stimulate interest in healthy, safety and the environment, and are interactive and fun.”
Walking, biking or using public transit to attend the event is encouraged. “The Downtown Berkeley BART station is in the heart of Sunday Streets Berkeley,” organizers note.
Internet sources trace the origins of Sunday Streets, now celebrated in several dozen North American cities, to the “Ciclovía” street festival that began in Bogotá, Colombia several decades ago. The Berkeley event, inspired by Sunday Streets in San Francisco, was first held in 2012.
Nonprofits, schools, and small businesses can host an interactive activity at the festival for free. Sign up here.
Volunteers are needed to serve as “ambassadors,” to provide guidance to event participants and alternative route information to drivers, monitor traffic barriers, help set up and break down the event, and keep their assigned area clean. Sign up here. Volunteers will receive a baseball cap, a $5 coupon for Sports Basement, and a voucher for a meal at Sweetgreen, according to the event website.

Message from Immortals CEO Noah Whinston
Hey everyone,
I'm also sad to say goodbye to some of the members of the original IMT roster. I'd just ask all of you to remember that what we built at Immortals last year was bigger than any one player. It's a philosophy that we'll be carrying forward into 2017 with a roster with some old and some new faces. We recognize that this is a turbulent time for most League fans, whether you're a fan of Immortals or not, but we're going to come out the other side as the same organization we've always been. That means a competitive roster, top tier infrastructure, and a commitment to doing right by our fans both on and off the Rift.
You'll hear from me again when we announce our 2017 roster :)

Joseph Christian "Joey" Chestnut (born November 25, 1983) is an American competitive eater.  They are currently ranked first in the world by Major League Eating.[1]  They are a Vallejo, California native and resides in San Jose, California. Chestnut's height is 6-feet-one-inch (1.85 m); their weight is 230 pounds (104 kg).
On July 4, 2007, Chestnut won the 92nd Annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, beating six-time defending champion Takeru "Tsunami" Kobayashi by consuming 66 hot dogs and buns (HDB) in 12 minutes, which set a new world record. The following year, they successfully defended their title by winning a 5 hot dog eat-off after tying Kobayashi in consuming 59 HDB in 10 minutes. On July 4, 2009, Chestnut beat Kobayashi again, by consuming a new world record of 68 HDB and winning their third consecutive title. On July 4, 2010, Chestnut took home their 4th consecutive Mustard Belt eating 54 HDB. The 2010 contest was a runaway victory, as Kobayashi did not compete due to a contract dispute with Major League Eating.[2] On July 4, 2011, they won their fifth-consecutive championship with 62 HDB. 2012 marked their sixth consecutive win, when Chestnut tied their own world record from 2009 by devouring 68 HDB. In 2013, Chestnut captured their seventh straight title, eating a total of 69 HDB, breaking their previous world record. In 2014, Chestnut captured their eighth straight title eating a total of 61 HDB.
Chestnut proposed to their longtime girlfriend Neslie Ricasa just before defending their title in the 2014 Nathan's competition.[3] The couple split up in early 2015, prior to their scheduled wedding date.[4]
Chestnut lost the 2015 Hot Dog eating contest to Matt Stonie.[5] On July 4, 2016, Chestnut regained the championship belt from Stonie by eating 70 hot dogs; 3.5 hot dogs short of their record-setting qualifying round. A year later on July 4, 2017, they raised the bar again by raising their record to 72 hot dogs; and again the following year to a world record of 74.
History [ edit ]
2005 [ edit ]
Chestnut, a San Jose State University student, entered the competitive eating scene in 2005 with a break-out performance in the deep-fried asparagus eating championship, in which they beat high-ranked eater Rich LeFevre by eating 6.3 pounds of asparagus in 11.5 minutes. That same year, during Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest, they downed 32 dogs, placing third behind Takeru Kobayashi and Sonya Thomas.
On October 22, 2005, Chestnut set a new world record for downing 32.5 grilled cheese sandwiches in 10 minutes at the Arizona State Fair, as part of the GoldenPalace.net World Grilled Cheese Eating Championship circuit.[6]
Chestnut defeated Thomas in the Waffle House World Waffle Eating Championship and placed second to them in a Krystal Square Off World Hamburger Eating Championship qualifier, downing 56 Krystal Burgers in eight minutes to their 57. They later beat them by eating 91 hamburgers in the finals, finishing second to the 97 hamburgers consumed by Kobayashi.
2006 [ edit ]
Chestnut qualified for the 2006 Nathan's Contest by eating 50 hot dogs with buns (HDB). As July 4 approached, there was speculation that 2006 might be the year when Kobayashi would be beaten.[7] It was not to be, however. Although Chestnut turned in a great performance, leading Takeru Kobayashi through most of the contest, the final tally put Chestnut at 52 and Kobayashi at ​53 3⁄ 4 (a new world record). Chestnut lost to Kobayashi in the Johnsonville World Bratwurst Eating Championship in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. They ate 41 bratwurst sausages in 10 minutes. Kobayashi ate 58.
2007 [ edit ]
In 2007, Chestnut won the Wing Bowl XV, an annual Philadelphia event at the Wachovia Center. In this competition, they ate 182 chicken wings in 30 minutes, becoming a Wing Bowl champion and record holder.
Chestnut was seen on a YouTube video drinking a gallon of milk in 41 seconds.[8]
On July 4, 2007, Chestnut and Kobayashi battled the field in a record-setting hot dog eating battle in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, at Nathan's Contest. Chestnut knocked off Kobayashi 66–63, leading to the latter's first defeat in the contest in six years.
On October 28, 2007, between 2:33 and 2:41, Chestnut ate 103 Krystal burgers in the Krystal Square Off World Hamburger Eating Championship in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This was Chestnut's personal best, and is the new world record.
2008 [ edit ]
Chestnut started off 2008 very well by setting two new world records: (1) they devoured 241 wings in 30 minutes at the Wing Bowl XVI in Philadelphia on February 1(The record was broken by Takeru Kobayashi at the Wing Bowl XX in 2011. Kobayashi ate 337 wings), and (2) they ate 78 matzo balls during Kenny & Ziggy's World Matzoh Ball Eating Championship in Houston, Texas on March 2.
On 24 March 2008, Chestnut set a new record at The Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo, Texas by eating a meal of 72-ounce ribeye steak, salad, baked potato, shrimp cocktail, and roll in just 8 minutes 52 seconds. Shortly after, on their show on KKLA, Frank Pastore, the previous record holder, congratulated Chestnut. (The overall human record is 4 minutes 18 seconds, done by Molly Schuyler on 19 April 2015, on their first of three meals. They subsequently had two more meals, and completed them all after 20 minutes elapsed.)
On 21 June 2008, Chestnut lost to Takeru Kobayashi in a Pizza Hut P'Zone competition at Sony Studios in Culver City, California. The competition aired on Spike TV on June 21.
On 4 July 2008, Chestnut tied Takeru Kobayashi in the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Contest after eating 59 HDB in 10 minutes. The tie resulted in a 5-hotdog eat-off, which Chestnut won by consuming all 5 hot dogs before Kobayashi. The 59 is a new record in the competition based on the reduction from 12 minutes to 10 minutes. Chestnut weighed in at 102 kilograms (225 pounds).[9]
On 28 July 2008, Chestnut lost to Takeru Kobayashi in Chicken Satay eating in the MLE Asia inaugural event. They consumed just over 4 kilograms to Kobayashi's almost 5.5.
On 23 August 2008, Chestnut defeated #2 IFOCE ranked competitive eater Pat "Deep Dish" Bertoletti in the 2nd Gyoza Eating Championship in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California. They devoured 231 gyozas, setting a new world record; they beat their previous record of 212, set in the inaugural event in 2006 when they narrowly defeated Sonya "Black Widow" Thomas (210). Thomas did not attend the 2008 event due to budgetary and travel costs.
On 12 October 2008, they consumed 45 slices of pizza, winning the "Famous Famiglia World Pizza Eating Championship", which was held in New York's Times Square. This would be a brief record until Bertoletti would consume 47 slices a few weeks later.[10]
2009 [ edit ]

On August 27, 2012, Chestnut cursed at Hofmann Hot dog and Kobayashi, stating in a Twitter post, "Congrats to @FReeKobio704 for eating a bunch of nasty Hoffman crap dogs. They needed an ego boost after 3 years of dodging competition."[17][18]
On September 2, 2012, Chestnut consumed 191 wings (7.61 pounds) in 12 minutes to win the 1st place competitive-eating trophy at the National Buffalo Wing Festival in Buffalo, New York. They defeated the previous five-year champion Sonya Thomas.[19]
On October 13, 2012, Chestnut won the Third Annual Smoke's Poutinerie World Poutine Eating Championships in Toronto, Ontario by consuming 19 boxes (9.5 pounds) of poutine in 10 minutes.[20]
2013 [ edit ]
On July 4, 2013, Chestnut successfully defended their title at Nathan's 98th Annual Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. They beat their own world record of 68 by consuming 69 HDB in 10 minutes, which earned them their 7th Mustard Belt for this competition.[21]
On July 25, 2013, Chestnut ate 179 wings in 10 minutes taking the title for the second year in a row at the Hooters World Wing-Eating Championship held in Clearwater, Florida.[22]
On September 22, 2013, Chestnut ate 70 bratwursts to set the world record and take their fourth straight title, at the Hillshire Farm Bratwurst Eating World Championship held at Oktoberfest Zinzinnati in Cincinnati, OH.[23]
2014 [ edit ]
On July 4, 2014, Chestnut ate more hot dogs than any of their opponents, narrowly defeating competitor Matt Stonie. They successfully ate 61 hot dogs to Stonie's 56, making this their 8th consecutive win. Prior to the event, Chestnut proposed to their longtime girlfriend, Neslie Ricasa.[24]
2015 [ edit ]
On July 4, 2015, Chestnut was defeated by Stonie. They successfully ate 60 hot dogs, but Stonie improved since 2014 and consumed 62 hot dogs, ending Chestnut's eight-year run as champion.[25]
2016 [ edit ]
On July 4, 2016, Chestnut redeemed themselves with 70 hot dogs and buns with Stonie behind with 53 hot dogs and buns. On September 4, 2016, they won their third consecutive title at the United States Chicken Wing Eating Championships in Buffalo, New York by eating 188 wings in 12 minutes.[citation needed]
2017 [ edit ]
On July 4, 2017, Chestnut defended their title and ate 72 hot dogs and buns. This was their 10th title and once again set a new Coney Island record. Carmen Cincotti was the closest competitor with 60.[26]
2018 [ edit ]
In 2018, Chestnut competed in The Amazing Race 30 alongside fellow competitive eater Tim Janus.[27] On July 4, Chestnut won their 11th title at Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest with a new record of 74 hot dogs.[28]
Training [ edit ]
Chestnut trains by fasting and by stretching their stomach with milk, water and protein supplements.[29] Since the start of their competitive eating career, their competition weight has varied from 225–240 pounds (102–109 kg). After winning their sixth consecutive hot dog eating contest in 2012 by eating 68 hot dogs, they stated, "I will not stop until I reach 70. This sport isn't about eating. It's about drive and dedication, and at the end of the day hot dog eating challenges both my body and my mind."[30]

I've been working recently on improving the performance of locking in D (the D programming language). At this moment the synchronized statement in D simply uses the underlying OS facilities–CriticalSection on Windows and pthread mutex on Linux. This incurs a substantial performance hit for multithreaded programming.
I looked at research in the Java community and found some interesting solutions. They are all versions of Thin Locks, first described by Bacon et al. These guys figured out that when a program is entering a synchronized section, in about 80% of the cases the section is not locked by anybody. The next most common case is nested locking–the section is locked by the same thread recursively. Only rarely there is actual contention for a lock. And when that happens, it's very likely that it will happen again and again. Such contended lock is most likely part of a shared data structure designed to be accessed by multiple threads.
Thin Locks optimize the most common case of no contention. Every Java Object has a word in its header that is used as a thin lock. If this field is zero (I'm skipping details here), the object is not locked. When a thread enters a synchronized section, it optimistically assumes that the lock is zero and tries to flip it to a non-zero value. This is done in one atomic operation, Compare And Swap (CAS). Most processor either have such an instruction built in, or provide primitives to implement it.
CAS checks the value in memory, comparing it to the “expected value.” If the comparison succeeds, the “new value” is written in its place. In our case, we expected the value of the thin lock to be zero, and the new value we want to put there is the (non-zero) thread ID of the lock taker. If the CAS succeeds, we are done, we owne the lock.
If the CAS fails, the lock has already been taken. Again, the most likely case is that our own thread holds it. So we check if our thread ID is stored in the thin lock. If so, we increment the count field of the thin lock (several fields are cleverly mashed together into one word). We're done!
If we don't find our own thread ID in the thin lock, we know we have contention. We have to inflate the lock–allocate an additional object (the fat lock) that holds the general-purpose OS-based mutex. Of course we also check if the thin lock hasn't already been inflated, in which case we just lock the fat lock.
The inflation process is a little tricky–we can't just modify the thin lock while it's bein held by another thread. Instead we spin wait for it to be released, then try to acquire it ourselves, and then inflate it. Once inflated, the lock remains inflated forever; which usually is the right thing to do anyway, since a lock that's been contended once, is likely to be contended many times. The one-time spinning is amortized across many accesses.
Of course there are details that I've omitted, but I gave you the gist of the algorithm. It makes un-contended locking so cheap (one CAS) that in most cases there is no reason to implement two versions, one for single- and one for multithreaded use, of the same data structure. A single-threaded program doesn't have to pay the multithreaded penalty when using general-purpose libraries.

ST. PETERSBURG — After a brutal week in which they were shut out in both road matches, the Rowdies needed to get back on track Saturday night against rival Fort Lauderdale.
Thanks to two second-half goals and a clutch penalty kick save by goalkeeper Matt Pickens, Tampa Bay got a much-needed three points in a 2-1 win over the Strikers in front of 4,997 at Al Lang Stadium.
"After two tough losses on the road, you want to come back home and win three or four to nil," Rowdies head coach Stuart Campbell said. "But it's not like that. You have to grind it out. We showed great character."
The Rowdies improved to 6-5-6 overall and got their second win of the fall season. The Strikers fell to 5-8-4.
The Rowdies had three top-notch scoring chances in the first five minutes of the second half then finally converted in the 50th minute.
Joe Cole settled a pass on the right corner of the field and chipped a ball into the 18-yard box. The pass sailed over a Strikers defender and onto the foot of Keith Savage. Savage took a left-footed shot from just outside the left goal mouth that ticked off keeper Bruno's glove, hit the crossbar and landed just over the goal line to make it 1-0.
"I was in the right place at the right time," Savage said. "I'm glad it went in because I should've scored a few before that. I got a lucky bounce for it to land at my feet. It was a great pass from Joe."
Cole got into the scoring action in the 57th minute. The goal was set up by Georgi Hristov, who darted near the right end line before angling a pass to Cole 15 yards from goal. Their shot nicked off a Strikers defender and settled into the left side of the net. It was Cole's fourth goal since joining the Rowdies in May.
"It was a great pass from Georgi," Cole said. "He worked their socks off. This was a massive win. It steadies the ship."
With more than 30 minutes still to play, the ship almost sunk.
In the 71st minute, the Strikers found the net when Jose Angulo got behind the Rowdies defense. Adrianinho lofted a perfect pass to Angulo, who took an uncontested shot from 10 yards out that beat Pickens.
In the 75th minute, the Rowdies were called for a handball in the 18-yard box, which set up a penalty kick. Adrianinho took the shot. After making a few stutter steps, their left-footed shot went low and right. Pickens dived the right way and deflected the ball away from goal.
Update — January 15, 2013
As anticipated by some, ThinkMusic has announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund their project. Those inclined to support this endeavor might pause to consider its credibility, given that it has gained notoriety largely for a promotional video that masquerades other products as ThinkMusic's own, original app — even as they state that they have been working on their app for over a year.
I have asked ThinkMusic these questions about their approach:
Did you use Sibelius and GoodReader to create the examples in your initial promotional video? If so, why? Did it at all occur to you that people would think that the video showed your actual app in action, and not merely a dramatization using another company's product? Why did you choose to not clearly disclose that the video was a dramatization until today, more than two weeks after the video was uploaded to YouTube? Did any of the examples in your initial video or the Kickstarter video actually show your app in action, or were they all simulated using other software? If so, which one(s) were your actual app?
One might also ask what track record, if any, ThinkMusic or its individuals have in creating working software.
It does not state anywhere in the Kickstarter video that what is shown is a dramatization, nor does it so state in the original YouTube video. An FAQ is on the Kickstarter web page, as well a note (just added yesterday) on the YouTube page that the video is a “mockup for demonstration”, but these, of course, would not show up anywhere where the videos were embedded. The FAQ / YouTube note also does not indicate whether the mockup was made using another company's software, or if it was made with screenshots of ThinkMusic's own app.
If ThinkMusic replies, I will post an update.
Original post — January 7, 2013
Last week, I posted about a video that purported to show an iOS app that, among other things, could recognize handwritten music manuscript and turn it instantly into engraved music. However, I was skeptical that the video actually demonstrated a functioning app, concluding instead that the images shown on the tablet in the video were produced by Sibelius.
The makers of the video, an entity called ThinkMusic Technology, did not mention that the video was a dramatization. In fact, they led excited followers on Twitter to believe the app, as demonstrated, was real:
@techinmusiced oh it's for real! Stay tuned for more info coming in the next week or two! — ThinkMusic Tech (@ThinkMusicTech) January 3, 2013
I am now certain that every single one of the music notation examples shown in the video, were, in fact, simply images exported from Sibelius using settings identical to, or very close to the defaults of the House Style “Standard Opus (Times)” and modified using GoodReader, a widely popular annotation app. No actual handwriting recognition, MIDI input, or other app functions were taking place. Everything shown in the video was a clever simulation, and not at all indicative of any working app.
What are the “tells”? In addition to the output comparison I posted about previously, also notice:
At 0:29 no music actually appears to change on the screen despite someone playing (although because it is shot out of focus it's hard to say for absolute certain)
At 0:39 when the user zooms in, the mocked-up menu bar at the top left of the screen and the slider at the bottom also zooms out of view, suggesting that the menu bar and slider were part of the mocked up image and not part of the app
At 0:42, the GoodReader Freehand drawing mode icons are clearly shown (see below)
At 0:44 the last three notes in m. 8 in the left hand are C, B, A. Yet when the button is tapped to “translate” the handwritten chords, the notes change to D, C, B. This could be explained away as a “bug” but is more likely a continuity error on the part of the filmmaker
At 0:49 in m. 11, the handwritten slur goes to F sharp, but the notated slur goes to the G in the next bar — bug or continuity error?
At 1:14 the last note in the right hand is a B-G dyad and there is no music in the left hand. When the music flips to portrait orientation the dyad is gone – only the G remains, yet there is now music in the left hand — again, bug or continuity error?
Daniel Spreadbury, formerly the Senior Product Manager for Sibelius, now product marketing manager for Steinberg, and perhaps the foremost authority on Sibelius, tweeted:
@ThinkMusicTech Your video looks great, but it's a mock-up, not the real thing… unless the real thing is Sibelius. pic.twitter.com/51eS5W0k — Daniel Spreadbury (@dspreadbury) January 4, 2013
@ThinkMusicTech Another shot from your video. Have you got permission to be using Sibelius's fonts in your app? pic.twitter.com/psaEIWnA — Daniel Spreadbury (@dspreadbury) January 4, 2013
I reached out to ThinkMusic and received this reply from Brandon Shaw, who, along with Diego De la Rosa, identify themselves as co-founders of ThinkMusic:
Thanks for your emails and letting us know about your blog posts. We're working musicians and have long been users of Sibelius, Finale, and some other great notation programs. When we write music, sometimes it calls for advanced software, and other times, just a napkin and the waiter's pencil. We started thinking about how to harness the power of existing programs and tablets, along with handwriting recognition. Our app will combine the best of those worlds so musicians can have another option for notating their creativity. The ThinkMusic iPad App is in development. We view the purpose of our App to be an additional tool for users of other notation software, rather than a substitute. Our video shows the purpose of the App, which, as noted at the end, is “Coming Soon”. More details will be out shortly, including functions, features, timelines, and our partners in development.
In a follow-up e-mail, Brandon said:
Our “Coming Soon” video is not an exhaustive list of specs and features. It is not a final product demo or an operating manual. It is a preview intended to let fellow musicians know about our app, which is in development. We assure you this is not a hoax, not an experiment, and certainly not a joke. It is a very real project that will give musicians “cause for celebration.”
Several requests for ThinkMusic to comment specifically on whether or not the music examples in the video were a series of images produced using Sibelius, and manipulated using conventional software, went unanswered.
ThinkMusic has not demonstrated that they can develop a working app, but they have succeeded in several areas. First, they have shown an ability to create an impressive marketing campaign and capture people's interest through social media. Second, they have identified a desire for a successful product that would actually do what they have dramatized in their video. Moreover, they have some genuinely good ideas about how such an app might function. Avid's Scorch and MakeMusic's Finale SongBook are read-only apps and are tied into each company's proprietary file format. MuseScore says that they have an app in development, but it is called “MuseScore Player” and so, it too will presumably be a read-only app. Notation apps such as Symphony Pro and Notion have yet to gain wide acceptance in the market.
Perhaps we will see an app “coming soon” from ThinkMusic or another developer after all. However, a fully functioning app is a long way from a product idea (even one as cleverly dramatized by ThinkMusic) — especially if the app is to function with the ease and fluidity demonstrated in the video. If ThinkMusic does produce an app, was their reliance on Sibelius's output and GoodReader's drawing mode in marketing the app's key features (especially without a disclaimer) a forgivable indiscretion? Or does it fundamentally undermine their product? Only the market, and perhaps some lawyers, will decide.
In the meantime, to all the well-meaning musicians, educators, and bloggers who were willing to accept the video at face value and start supporting ThinkMusic, a note of caution: The Brooklyn Bridge is still not for sale — even if an image of an iPad app appears to indicate otherwise.

Fort Worth, Texas police announced this morning that they have made an arrest in the firebomb attack on the office of Democratic state senator Wendy Davis, says a report at NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.com. Cedric Steele, 40, has been arrested on charges of arson of a building and is being held on a $50,000 bond.
The attack came Tuesday night. Steele is accused of trying to light multiple “Molotov cocktails” (glass bottles filled with accelerant) outside Davis's office door. The devices created a small fire that was extinguished by staff members who where present at the time.
Witnesses say that Steele had visited the senator's office on March 16 and March 19 demanding to speak with them When they were told that Davis was not in the office, Steele became agitated and threatening, telling staff that they would soon “read about them on the news.”
Police said that witness reports and physical evidence led them to Steele's place of residence, a vacant building where officers found an empty lighter-fluid can, wicks and other materials used to create an incendiary device. Steele was arrested in the parking lot of a convenience store and taken into police custody.
Davis issued a statement this morning thanking the Fort Worth Police and Fire Departments for their swift action. “Working together, they did something quite remarkable less than 24 hours after this incident occurred,” they said. “They have done superior work and have demonstrated once again why we call them Fort Worth's finest.”
The senator's office will re-open for business on Thursday morning.

There's a Range Rover parked opposite my house. I don't need a Range Rover. I don't go out of my way to drive up dirt tracks. I don't have any children that need dropping off at school. I don't even have a pair of dogs that want to go for lovely countryside walks.
And yet still it sits there, silent, accusing. I could make time to go on off-road adventures, it seems to say. I could conquer any terrain I pleased if I were behind the wheel of a Range Rover. I could get a couple of canines and whisk them anywhere I wanted.
Even shutting the curtains doesn't help, because I know it's still there. And when it isn't there, it's still in my mind's eye. Why, Land Rover, why would you do this to me? Is there some conspiracy to induce consumption of Range Rovers, a nationwide secret society spending all day parking in streets up and down the country just to make people covet their wares?
Of course not. Well, most likely not at any rate. But there is something wholly compelling about the Range Rover that gets under the skin. Heads turn wherever a Range Rover hoves into view, majestically sweeping past and making everything seem so small in comparison.
If you're not a fan of big 4×4 cars, needless to say that a Land Rover is probably not for you. But if you've always wondered what it's like to be able to look over the roof of the car in front, you will probably be tempted by the thought of a used Land Rover Range Rover. And with the added incentive of being able to conduct itself handsomely on off-road terrain as well as the motorway, one can see why the Range Rover has become such a popular choice for those seeking a car that combines space with practicality.
If I could justify the purchase of a used Land Rover Range Rover, I would be toddling along to a specialist dealership in order to arrange a test drive. But before I do that I have some dog breeders to contact and some countryside to scout out.
It's not the car for everyone, but it certainly could be the one if you're in need of generous interior space and high-performance handling that can take rough terrain in its stride. Just please don't park it outside my house, because I'm getting tired of wiping my nose prints off the window.
Sir Cherrylton is being plagued by intrusive thoughts of test driving a used Land Rover Range Rover.

Bigfoot Shot in San Antonio?
For some time now we've posed the question, 'Why Can't We Leave Bigfoot Alone?', and today we may have an answer - is it because they were real, all along?
"Sasquatch Hunter" by trade Rick Dyer thinks so, and says they have the proof to support their claim.
Last September, Dyer says they set out some tasty bait for the famed beast - a lavish amount of pork ribs slathered in BBQ sauce and nailed to a tree - and, they claim, shot the 7ft 10in Bigfoot that they have been hunting for so long. The body remains in their private possession, though they have shown it to "130 people," and they posted a few photos as additional proof online today. A news conference is expected to occur in the next couple of days.
You may remember Rick Dyer from back in 2008, when they previously claimed to have killed Bigfoot but it turned out to just be their friend in an ape-like suit. They claim their delay in posting their proof and sharing it with the news community was delayed so that they could have extensive testing performed on the Bigfoot they are calling, "Hank."
Mr. Dyer told US TV station KSAT:
"Every test that you can possibly imagine was performed on this body - from DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world."
Bigfoot Shot in San Antonio:
What do you think? Is it possible that the famed 'Sasquatch Hunter' has, in fact, killed a/the Bigfoot? Share your thoughts in the comments below.
Some exciting news came yesterday in regards to Rhapsody and their possibly soon-to-be-launched iPhone application. I say “possibly” because Rhapsody has finished their iPhone application, however it has been submitted for approval and its entry into the App Store is now sitting in the hands of Apple.
Anyway, buried deep down in the bottom of the announcement on the Real Networks Blog was a nice little bit about Android. According to their post, they are “working diligently on an Android app.”
Sadly though they included no other details as to when we could expect to see this app become available in the Android Market.
In regards to the app itself, this is just speculation based on the iPhone app, however the app will be available as a free download, but in order to use it (aside from a short free trial), you will need to be a Rhapsody ToGo subscriber.
For those unfamiliar with the Rhapsody ToGo service, in short it is a subscription based music service that allows for on-demand music listening. One thing I am interested in learning is in regards to the Android app is whether it will allow for offline play. Personally that is a big portion of an on-demand service and sadly their iPhone app will allow only for streaming. Lets hope that Rhapsody is able to take advantage of the memory card for storage and allow for offline use.
Of course, with this, I now have one more reason to need to carry around that silly dongle in order to use my headphones or car auxiliary jack.
Washington D. C. - Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson announced that the government would begin implementing video game like achievements for consumers to help stimulate consumer spending. "Consumers are two-thirds of the economy, so we're trying to find the best way to get them buying again. Achievements in video games have been successful in getting people to playing games more than they should, so we're hoping these consumer achievements get people buying more than they should to get the economy going again," said Paulson. Citizens do not have to do anything to enroll in the program and purchases are tracked automatically using technology from the NSA. Taxpayers can follow their achievements on the new consumerachievments.gov Web site. For all achievements reached, citizens will receive a small graphic they can display on their personal blog, and that will be printed on their passport. Accumulating enough achievements will allow citizens to unlock more valuable achievements, which can result in rewards like a tax rebate or lunch with a Senator. Consumers were excited by the news. "I'm hopelessly in debt and my home is being foreclosed on, but I think I can scrape enough together to get the "Feed Family" achievement," said Claudia Harcox of Muncie, Indiana. Paulson also hinted that if successful this program might be expanded to business with achievements like "Recapitalize a Bank" and "Create 100 Jobs in One Quarter." A small group of the achievement graphics were released to the press with the full list available at the consumerachievments.gov Web site. Cash King - Purchase over $200 worth of merchandise using cash. Eater Outer - Eat away from home for more than half your meals in a month. Go Big or Go Home - Purchase two or more SUVs in a calendar year. Gun Guru - Arm yourself with a newly purchased handgun. Jewel Giant - Purchase $1000 worth of jewelry a month for three consecutive months. Material Girl - Any combination of jewels, clothes or spa treatments worth $2500 in a month. Speed Demon - Purchase a sports car with estimated MPG under 10. Story Options: Related Share Print
The only job David Cameron ever had outside politics was as a PR man for a large corporation – and now they are using the skills they learnt then to launch an act of rebranding worthy of a panicked business desperate for brand decontamination.
The Prime Minister knows it's wildly unpopular to impose the biggest programme of cuts since the 1920s – especially when our national debt has actually been higher for 200 of the past 250 years. YouGov has found that 50 per cent of us think the cuts are too deep, 53 per cent think they are bad for the economy, and 63 per cent think they are unfair. But rather than listen to the people, Cameron has a different solution: rename the cuts. From now on, they are to be called "savings".
The Prime Minister is trying to impose this shift on the BBC, publicly lambasting them last week into altering their vocabulary. The excellent blog Liberal Conspiracy has documented the subsequent shift in their news reports. But this is a change from using a factual and neutral word to one that is in many cases literally inaccurate.

Let's start with the word "cuts". It is not a pejorative. I have cut the amount of food I eat over the past year, and I'm proud of it. I have cut the amount of time I spend reading fiction, and I'm dismayed by it. The word neutrally and aptly describes both. It means simply "to reduce the size, extent or duration of". The word "savings" means something different – and they are not synonymous. Here are three obvious examples of cuts that are not savings.
Example one. The major HIV charities are warning that the Government's actions are leading to a big cut in the public money given to their projects to persuade high-risk people to be tested for HIV, and then carrying out the test quickly and for free. So the number who find out they are HIV-positive is going to fall. They will then be – as reams of research has demonstrated – considerably more likely to spread the disease. All the people they infect will then eventually require treatment. So the Government gets to keep the £50 for an HIV test and the £10,000 a year for somebody who persuades hundreds of people to take it, but then they have to spend £250,000 to treat each newly infected person over their lifetime. That's a cut – but it's not a saving.
Example two. Public investment in the arts is being cut by 27 per cent. To pluck one example, the Film Council was abolished, even though it funded a renaissance of British cinema, including the Oscars-smash The King's Speech. Independent studies found that for every £1 the Arts Council spends, it generates £2 more in tourism (these films are massive adverts for Britain), added employment, new tax revenues, and more. That's a cut – but it's not a saving.
Example three. Until Cameron, local authorities were required by law to make sure that when a young offender was released from custody, they were given a place to live. The reason is obvious: if a young person who has fallen into crime walks out of jail with no money and nowhere to go, they are virtually guaranteed to commit more crime. That means you or me getting mugged or burgled. Now the Government has abolished that responsibility. So they'll get to keep the £5,000 a year it would have cost to house them, and instead will spend the £78,000 a year it costs to process them through the criminal justice system. That's a cut – but it's not a saving.
If Cameron coaxes the BBC – and others – into rebranding these acts as "savings", they have coaxed them into a lie. George Orwell wrote: "Political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least... send some worn-out and useless phrase into the dustbin, where it belongs." The "saving" we need most is to save our language from being contaminated with this latest lie.

A close adviser to the Trump White House described the revelations surrounding Mr. Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and their meetings with a Russian lawyer as a "Category Five hurricane", CBS News' Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett reports.
The adviser called it "very bad" as the fallout over Trump Jr.'s meeting continues after revealing details into the arrangement of the meeting were released in a series of emails.
Garrett reports that another outside adviser to the White House echoed those sentiments, conceding that the optics of the meeting were "terrible" and create "big atmospheric problems" for the administration as they attempt to distance themselves from the Russian meddling narrative.
Mr. Trump has since defended their son's actions, telling Reuters "I think many people would have held that meeting." Mr. Trump has also repeatedly tweeted their support of Trump Jr., calling them "transparent" and "open."
My son Donald did a good job last night. They were open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017
Meanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort informed the House and Senate intelligence committees of the June 9th meeting at Trump Tower, CBS News has confirmed. Manafort was included in the meeting with Trump Jr., as was Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
According to a source close to the Senate intel's investigation, Manafort's team only notified the committee about the meeting about a week and a half ago as the New York Times prepared to publish its first initial reporting on the meeting.
While the issue of Russian interference and the administration's connections to Russian government officials shows few signs of slowing down, the White House appears to be shifting focus to other immediate issues -- including a push for the Senate's health care plan passage and the recent success of helping to bring an all-girl team of young Afghani robotics engineers into the U.S. after their visa's were denied.
Mr. Trump will discuss agenda-setting matters as they deliver remarks in Paris on Thursday with French President Emmanuel Macron. The two are expected to talk about the ongoing crisis in Syria as well as counter-terrorism efforts.

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos! Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. 2009 December 31
Explanation: Dust makes this cosmic eye look red. The eerie Spitzer Space Telescope image shows infrared radiation from the well-studied Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) a mere 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius. The two light-year diameter shroud of dust and gas around a central white dwarf has long been considered an excellent example of a planetary nebula, representing the final stages in the evolution of a sun-like star. But the Spitzer data show the nebula's central star itself is immersed in a surprisingly bright infrared glow. Models suggest the glow is produced by a dust debris disk. Even though the nebular material was ejected from the star many thousands of years ago, the close-in dust could be generated by collisions in a reservoir of objects analogous to our own solar system's Kuiper Belt or cometary Oort cloud. Formed in the distant planetary system, the comet-like bodies would have otherwise survived even the dramatic late stages of the star's evolution.
AfrikaBurn is an annual event held in the deserts of the Tankwa Karoo in South Africa that invites artists to display their work and then eventually light it up in a blaze of glory, in true Burning Man fashion. The regional event, which most recently hosted approximately 6,500 people, follows the same eleven guiding principles as Nevada's famed Burning Man festival, encouraging “communal effort, decommodification and total expression of the self.”
Following the basic guidelines, the festival's 2013 Archetypes theme welcomed thousands of visitors and participants with some truly incredible installations. One of the most prominent figures included artist Daniel Popper's massive, 9-meter-high sculpture of a man with outstretched arms. The three-story structure was fitted with custom LED lights with seventeen different simulations programmed by Justin Eastman. Other structures ranged from abstract pieces of land art to illuminated pathways.
Check out some of the best photos of AfrikaBurn 2013, below.

You know Martin Shkreli, right? The guy who has dominated the news for nearly four months now? The world's most hated pharmaceutical executive?
The Shkrel Man first came to public attention for increasing the price of a drug used to treat AIDS more than 55-fold overnight, tweeting "lol" at Hilary Clinton when they asked them to cut the cost back, and for being a bit of an emo (he was revealed to have invested in Collect Records). About a week ago they were named as the buyer of Wu-Tang Clan's one-off $2 million album, and then they spent an entire smug day live streaming their life on YouTube to disillusioned Wu Tang fans while they made a list of artists they might pay to make an album just for him. Then, yesterday, in a desperate bid to improve their public persona, they claimed to be in the process of bailing Bobby Shmurda out of jail. Basically, Shkreli's list of accomplishments in the last few months has been so thoroughly heinous that even Donald Trump called them a “spoiled brat".
Now, in a fresh new twist to events, the 32-year-old has been arrested on securities and fraud charges.  They are suspected of plundering a firm they founded to pay off personal debts. What a guy, huh? Bloomberg reports:
"The federal case against them has nothing to do with pharmaceutical costs, however. Prosecutors charged them with illegally taking stock from Retrophin Inc., a biotechnology firm they started in 2011, and using it pay off debts from unrelated business dealings. They were later ousted from the company, where he'd been chief executive officer, and sued by its board.
In the case that closely tracks that suit, federal prosecutors accused Shkreli of engaging in a complicated shell game after their defunct hedge fund, MSMB Capital Management, lost millions.  They are alleged to have made secret payoffs and set up sham consulting arrangements."

If you, quite rightly, struggle to imagine what a day in the life of Martin Shkreli must be like, we wrote a piece about it here.
Toronto-based wearable startup Nymi announced this morning that it has completed something that, just a few years ago, would have been considered science fiction. With a little help from TD and MasterCard, the company has completed what it says is the world's first biometrically authenticated, wearable credit card payment, using a Nymi Band and the user's heartbeat.
The payment was made last month, as part of a new closed pilot. Over 100 TD users in the GTA, Ottawa, and Regina will continue to test the Nymi Band's biometric payment functionality until the end of summer, and Nymi says that other participating Canadian banks are scheduled to launch similar pilots later this year.
The Nymi Band works by identifying a user based upon their unique heartbeat (electrocardiogram) through the company's proprietary HeartID technology. For the pilot testing, Nymi developed an NFC-enabled version of the Nymi Band that can link to the tester's MasterCard.
“Nymi's goal is to fundamentally change the way authentication is treated and to move industries towards a more secure and convenient identity model,” said Nymi CEO Karl Martin. “By working with partners like TD and MasterCard, we are effectively demonstrating that continuous authentication can be a more secure and convenient way to make retail payments.
In an exclusive interview with BetaKit back in February, Martin was tight-lipped about the company's planned pilot programs, saying, “we don't want to yell at the top of the mountain until we're really sure we have something they're going to love.”
It seems as though the company took a major step up the mountain this summer.
It's hard to say for sure exactly when I started snowboarding because, in the beginning, everything I did with my brother Mickey was just in the front yard of our house in Michigan. It started with sledding when I was two or three years old. I don't remember exactly when that transitioned into standing on the sled as we went down the hills; I was probably around five or six.
Eventually, though, when we began to build jumps in the front yard, my mom was like “All right, fine.” They saw snowboards at K-Mart, these super cheap boards that we were so pumped to get. We rode those for a couple of years and then eventually my dad wanted in on snowboarding too. That's when we really got legit. We got real good boards; I was probably nine or ten and so stoked when that happened.
I had no idea that snowboarding was something that could become my livelihood until I was graduating from Stratton [Mountain School in Vermont]. Before that, it seemed a lot more like baseball or football, something that I loved to do just for the fun of it. When I went to Stratton for my junior and senior years, we rode every day. We would go riding in the morning and go to class in the afternoon and evenings. When it wasn't winter, we did dry land training in the gym. We hit contests all year.
When graduation came, I'd just gotten an incentive contract from Burton because I'd won a couple of contests.
My parents and I were like, “Woah.” They looked and me and said, “All right—well, what do you want to do? You've got some money now, this could be something you do for a living.”
I was 17 years old when I decided not to go to college; I was going to buy a car and go out west and try to do this. My parents were 100% supportive. They let me make my own choice about it. So I bought a 2004 GMC Sierra—to this day the only car I've ever owned—and moved out west.
At this point, I'd say my love of snowboarding was still super child-like. I didn't have time to get nervous about things or worry about decisions. A sponsor would say “Hey, we're going to send you to the Arctic Challenge. What do you think?” I'd say yes to pretty much everything because it sounded like a cool chance to ride somewhere new. I'd get there and feel no stress, no worries, just new powder. I never put pressure on myself to win anything, I was just happy to be there. I was a 17-year-old kid who was in Norway specifically to go snowboarding with all of these amazing legends of the sport. I was very child-like with it all for a long time.
I still feel like I hold on to that a little bit, but it has changed. It's a bit more work now. As you get older, you naturally try to make more happen for yourself. In the past, if someone called me to go somewhere I would, but otherwise I was happy to stay home and shred on my own. Today, I'm the one making trips happen.
Where's the film guy? Do I need to get them a flight? A place to stay? How do we make it happen?
I'm trying to put out content and putting more effort into the logistics, which can take away from the riding at times. But it's fun. It's the coolest job in the world, no doubt.

was the winner. They won a bunch of contests and was widely known as the guy who was going to win for a long time. When people would talk about me, they'd say, “Well, maybe Danny can put it all together this time,” Sometimes I'd land and sometimes I wouldn't. That was very much my MO for a long time. When I did land, I'd do well here and there. Some wins, a couple of seconds, a couple of thirds.
All the attention that has come since I've started landing runs in big events has been a trip. Sometimes it can be a little much. It almost feels like a racket, how much of you they want. But it makes the snowboarding more special. My time to snowboard now is similar to airplane mode on cell phones. No one can call me. No one can text me. I put my headphones in and forget everything. My time on the mountain is very meditative these days. It's for me. It's almost like a vacation. That feeling of peace when people get to disconnect and experience a sense of freedom that is outside of the norm? Most people get it once a week on weekends, or maybe even less than that. I get that feeling every day for a few hours. Snowboarding is my work and my escape.
Comparing my current relationship with snowboarding with what it was when I was the teenage version of myself, I'd say back then it was puppy love. I had no idea of the depth of the world I was entering. I just knew I wanted to snowboard, and as long as I could, that was enough. Today, it's full-on commitment. The relationship isn't as easy and carefree, but I'm committed and willing to do what needs to be done to make it work. I need it to be happy today. Back then, I had football, baseball, basketball; I didn't know what I wanted yet. But today, I'm bummed if I can't go snowboard. I guess the best way to say it is that I didn't know how in love with snowboarding I was or how deep that love would become. It's definitely more important to me now than it was then.
I've grown with it and it's done so much for me. Snowboarding has given me a lot of opportunities, most of my friends, an insane network of support that's there when I'm injured. And it's not just the people I've met since people started using my first and last name. I'm talking about my buddies back in Michigan who I began snowboarding with. Those are some of the best relationships I have and they grew through snowboarding. No superpipe is going to make me forget them.
I guess you can say that the bull's eye is on my back now. It's no less enjoyable. It's just a different time, a different crew. There's no Scotty [Lago], there's no Mason [Aguirre]. There's no Luke or Jack [Mitrani]. I travel a lot with Mark McMorris now, and we have kind of the same relationship. It's always best when you go to a contest and it's not just you against everyone. Now, I've got Mark, Darcy Sharpe, Ben Ferg[uson]. It makes the contest easier because it's not about just yourself. If they do well, you're happy for them. Hopefully you do well too, but the community is what it's all about.
I hope I can snowboard until I die. The day I die, I hope I'm snowboarding. Competitively, I'd love to go for as long as I can. Afterwards, I want to be able to still ride professionally and live off of it. I don't want to host. I don't want to judge. I want to be doing it for as long as I can. When I'm done event riding, I'll take it to the backcountry, which is a completely different world.

Competition is all about who is better than the next guy. But backcountry filming is about who can find the coolest stuff to hit. If you and I go to the same mountain, we will see it differently. It's a lot like how it used to be in the front yard in Michigan when we were deciding what to build, so it feels like it takes more back to my roots more than event riding. The potential for creativity is infinite.
Do you want to tree ride? Do you want to cliff ride? Do you want to build a wedge and hit that? How are you going to do it?
Those are some of my favorite questions in the world.
—As told to Ryan Wallerson
An investment group led by Indianapolis-based Strategic Capital Partners is proposing to build a $220 million mixed-use development on the Indianapolis Public Schools' property along downtown's Massachusetts Avenue that houses a former Coca-Cola bottling plant.
Strategic Capital Partners is one of several firms vying to redevelop the 11-acre site near Massachusetts and College avenues. It released its plans late Thursday afternoon near the deadline to submit proposals.
The proposal includes 140,000 square feet of retail space and 90,000 square feet of office space. In addition, 500 market-rate and 75 affordable apartment units would be built, along with 30 townhomes.
Indy Square, as the proposal is called, also would include a 150-room hotel, a YMCA daycare, 75,000-square-foot park and 1,600 parking spaces.
Also submitting proposals were Milhaus Development LLC, Hendricks Commercial Properties, Hageman Group, and the team of Browning Investments and Flaherty & Collins Properties, IPS said. Milhaus submitted two bids, bringing the total number of proposals to six.
Strategic Capital Partners is partnering with Schmidt Associates on the design of the project.
“Our design preserves as much of the historically significant portions of the site as possible,” Schmidt partner Desma Belsaas said in a written release.
That includes the entire original bottling plant and the terra cotta facades of the building's expansion.
Besides Schmidt, Strategic Capital Partners' team includes Carmel-based apartment developer J.C. Hart Co. Inc., which along with Schmidt, is developing the $50 million Montage on Mass apartment project.
“We've assembled a diverse team that has the experience and diversity to successfully execute the vision of Indy Square,” Strategic CEO Gene Zink said in a prepared statement.
The firm has developed projects at Keystone at the Crossing and the University of Indianapolis, in addition to Avondale Meadows, an apartment and retail project on the city's east side.
The IPS property sits within the downtown tax-increment financing district, which was expanded in 2012 to include the bottling plant site. The 285,000-square-foot plant is an art-deco landmark built in 1931 by the local architectural firm Rubush & Hunter.
On Thursday, Shopify announced that merchants can now buy and print discounted shipping labels within its platform using a new feature called Shopify Shipping.
“Shipping is a fundamental component of any online merchant's workflow. We're focused on streamlining shipping and product delivery for our merchants, so they can focus on other aspects of growing their business,” said Louis Kearns, director of product and merchant solutions at Shopify.
Merchants that use Shopify shipping will receive preferred USPS rates that are up to 60 percent off retail rates, and will now have the ability to either drop prepaid shipments off at USPS offices without having to wait in line or to schedule a free home pickup. At the same time, merchants can purchase shipping supplies like card readers, barcode printers, and gift cards directly from Shopify.
“With Shopify Shipping, not only are we saving merchants time and money, but we're also giving them the foundation they need to perfect their fulfillment strategy,” said Kearns. “We expect to expand these benefits to merchants in other geographies with additional shipping providers over time.”
This year's 41st issue of Akita Shoten's Weekly Shonen Champion magazine will announce on Thursday that Masami Kurumada will resume their Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - The Myth of Hades manga with the "latest series" in magazine's first 2016 issue on December 3. The series will commemorate the 30th anniversary of Saint Seiya.
Kurumada ended the latest "season" of the manga in January 2014 and put the manga on hiatus. They published special chapters for the series in June 2014 and and July 2015.
Kurumada began serializing Saint Seiya: Next Dimension - The Myth of Hades in 2006. The manga revolves around the villain Hades as they reminisce about their past life in the 18th century.
Kurumada published the original Saint Seiya manga from 1986 to 1990.
Mohammad Asadujjaman turns down reward after driving over 50 miles in search of Italian tourist who had left handbag behind
Mohammad Asadujjaman's mother may not have schooled them in the quickest routes through the mean streets of the Big Apple or the best ways to negotiate with its famously plain-speaking inhabitants.
But they do appear to have imbued the 28-year-old New York taxi driver with an even greater gift: incorruptible honesty.
On finding that an Italian tourist had left a handbag containing more than $21,000 (£13,000) in cash - not to mention jewellery worth thousands more - on their backseat on Christmas Eve, the Bangladesh-born cabbie knew exactly what to do.
They rummaged through the bag until they found an address in Long Island. Then they rang a friend with a car and embarked on a 50-mile trip in the hope of handing over their find to someone who knew their fare, 72-year-old Felicia Lettieri from Pompeii. When their knocks at the house belonging to Lettieri's sister, Francesca, went unanswered, Asadujjaman left their mobile number and a note reading: "Don't worry, Felicia … I'll keep it safe."
A little while later the phone rang and they headed back to the Long Island address to return the bag and keep their word.
"They were so, so, so happy," said Asadujjaman, a student who began driving a cab about three months ago after their hours were cut back at a factory.
Felicia Lettieri's absentmindedness had briefly threatened to ruin the family's holiday.
The bag, which they forgot while they and six other relatives were travelling in two taxis from midtown Manhattan to Penn station on 24 December, also contained some of the group's passports.
Police advised the tourists they had little chance of recovering the lost goods. Francesca Lettieri said Asadujjaman's honesty had averted disaster. "We really love what they did," they told Newsday.
The cabbie themselves shrugged off the incident, saying they had been taught never to take advantage of people. "My mother is my inspiration," they said. "She always said, be honest and work hard."
Despite conceding that such a large amount of money would have allowed them to focus on their studies, Asadujjaman insisted they were not tempted to keep it: "My heart said this is not good."
They also declined the reward the Lettieri family offered him, saying that as an observant Muslim they could not accept it.
"I'm needy, but I'm not greedy," they said. "It's better to be honest."
Pure-hearted taxi drivers are not as rare as some might think.
Two years ago, the Grammy-nominated violinist Philippe Quint left their $4m (£2m) Stradivarius in a New Jersey taxi after flying in to Newark airport at 3am.
Despite fearing that they would never see their 285-year-old ex-Kiesewetter violin again, Quint was eventually informed by the airport that the driver, Mohammed Khalil, had returned the precious instrument. To show their gratitude, Quint handed Khalil a $100 tip and free tickets to their next Carnegie Hall concert. They also gave a kerbside recital at the airport taxi rank to an audience of 50 cabbies.
The Central Criminal Court has heard that a 36-year-old man kicked another man to death following a row over a 70c phone call.
Zhen Dong Zhao, of Jervis Street, Dublin has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Noel Fegan, 40, in a Dublin city centre internet cafe last year.
Mr Zhao leased the ground floor of a premise on lower Wellington Quay in Dublin last year, which they operated as the e-Times internet cafe.
At around 3.50pm on Friday 20 May 2011, Mr Fegan and a friend went into the cafe to use a phone booth to call their daughter.
The court heard a row broke out between Mr Zhao and Mr Fegan over whether they had gotten through on the phone and owed 70c and that Mr Fegan slapped Mr Zhao in the face and ran out onto the quays.
Mr Zhao followed them and kicked them repeatedly in the body, head and neck.
Mr Fegan died a short time later.
Prosecuting Counsel Pauline Walley told the jury that Mr Fegan was on methadone and was in the Focus Centre in Dublin when they received a 'call me' text from their teenage daughter.
They said they had no credit on their phone, their friend did not have a phone, and they ended up in Mr Zhao's cafe after a number of other failed attempts to borrow a phone.
The jury was told that the attack on Mr Fegan took place during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II last year.
They heard that there was a large garda presence in the city and gardaí were on the scene almost immediately.
Defence Counsel Brendan Grehan read to the jury extracts from Mr Zhao's final interview with gardaí where in answer to questions they said: "I can' t remember how many times I kicked them I was so angry.
“Because they hit me first I was afraid they were going to hit me again. I didn't want to kill him. After I saw the CCTV footage I couldn't even recognise myself. This is not my intention at all. Just for 70c they lost their lives and I destroyed mine.”
Mr Zhao has pleaded not guilty to murder.
The trial is expected to last two weeks.
It is a rule that only people who have performed great deeds and are deemed worthy retain their bodies in afterlife, while the rest are turned into cloud-like ghosts. Yet evildoers who appear in Hell all retain their bodies. However, this mostly only happens in pointless filler episodes or scenes that were exclusive to the animated series (and thus not part of the original storyline presented in the manga). See more
Alternate Versions
The Hungarian dub, based on the infamous French version, renamed some characters even further. The Saiyans came to be called "Starfighters". Piccolo was called "Young Satan". King Kai was called "Kaito" and their Kaio-Ken technique became "Kaito, empower me!" or "Come forward, Kaito!". Frieza was originally called Dermesztina (Freeze-Tina), but was rechristened Dermesztö (Freezer) later when the translator found out that he's male. Dabura was called "Devla", after the God of the Romani people. Pui-Pui and Yacon were simplified to "Pipi" and "Yaco". The Kamehameha attack was always spoken as "Kamehame". Most of these changes were then carried over into the dub of Dragon Ball GT, which was based on the original Japanese version. See more
One of my previous posts detailed a “stepping into the guards” exercise I had created to teach the guards in Meyer's dussack system. The inspiration for this was Giovanni dall'Agocchie's passegiatta nelle guardia, and how learning this exercise made the Bolognese guards easy to remember (at least for me). Since that post I have altered the pattern to include a retreating portion; partially to be more in line with the inspirational form for this exercise, but also so that I wouldn't have to keep telling students to turn around or back up to their original space.
1.) Start feet together, dussack in the left hand (like it was in a sheath).
2.) Grasp the dussack with the right hand, raise up so that the “quillons” are just below the eyes in a salute.
3.) Pass back with the right foot into Zornhut (Wrath guard), the figure on the right.
4.) Execute a Zornhauw while passing forward with the right into Wechsel (the Changer), figure on the right.
5.) Pass forward with the left, executing an Underhauw into Stier (Steer), figure on the left.
6.) Pass forward with the right foot, executing a Mittelhauw into Mittelhut, figure on the right.
7.) Pass forward with the left foot, executing a Zornhauw from the left into Eber (The Boar), figure on the left.
8.) Pass forward with the right and thrust into Langort (Longpoint), figure on the left.
9.) Retract the right foot so that the heels touch and go into Wacht (the Watch), figure on the right.
10.) Pass forward with the left, executing a Oberhauw from the left into the guard of Bastey (Bastion), no image.
11.) Pass with the right foot forward and execute an Underhauw into Bogen (the Bow), image on the left.
12.) Execute a Zornhauw and land in gerade Versatzung (Straight Parrying), with a gentle shuffle forward, image on the right.
13.) Retract the right foot so that the heels touch, raising the dussack into Stier on the left.
14.) Pass back with the right foot, cutting into Wechsel on the right.
15.) Pass back with the left foot, executing an Underhauw into left Zornhut.
16.) Pass back with the right foot, using a Zornhauw on the left to land in Eber.
17.) Pass back with the left foot, thrusting into Langort.
18.) Retract the right foot so that the heels touch, landing in Wacht.
19.) Salute and place the dussack in the left hand as if placing it in its sheath.
Missouri man James Pittman testified that they suffered through seven years of anti-gay workplace harassment before ultimately getting fired for being gay.
Unfortunately, he'll be unable to sue for discrimination, according to a 2-1 decision made by the Western District Missouri Court of Appeals.
According to testimony, Pittman was called a “c**ksucker” and asked if they had AIDS by Cook Paper president Joe Jurden. When they broke up with their partner, Pittman claims employees treated them “more harshly than a male who was getting a divorce from their female wife” and “caused the workplace to be an objectively hostile and abusive environment based on sexual preference.”
The court ruled that the state law barring discrimination based on sex only applies to gender-based actions — not one's sexuality.
Pittman's lawsuit against Cook Paper Recycling Corp. was dismissed in February 2013, and he'd appealed that initial decision.
“If the Missouri legislature had desired to include sexual orientation in the Missouri Human Rights Act's protections, it would have done so,” wrote Chief Judge James Welch. “No matter how compelling Pittman's argument may be and no matter how sympathetic this court or the trial court may be to Pittman's situation, we are bound by the state of the law as it currently exists.”
Currently, Missouri law bars employment discrimination based on one's race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age or disability.
Lynne Bratcher, Pittman's attorney, stated that she'll try to get the Missouri Supreme Court to hear the case.
“This is just a really good example that discrimination exists against LGBT folks and updating the Missouri statute is so vital,” said Steph Perkins, interim director of PROMO.
In a prepared statement, Sarah Rossi, director of advocacy and policy at the ACLU, had this to say:
“Today the Missouri Court of Appeals made two things very clear: Missourians are being harassed, bullied, and fired from their jobs for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual and they will have no recourse in the courts unless the state legislature changes the Missouri Human Rights Act to protect them.”
Missouri is one of 28 states that still doesn't offer any kind of employment discrimination protection to LGBTQ people.

By Damon MartinCody Garbrandt set the internet on fire on Wednesday when they released a photo on Twitter with the caption "UFC 217 Madison Square Garden vs. T.J. Dillashaw."[tweet url="https://twitter.com/Cody_Nolove/status/895302997600681984" hide_media="0" hide_thread="1"]Immediately afterward, numerous outlets began reporting that Garbrandt was confirming their fight with Dillashaw was set for the November 4 card in New York City.As it turns out, Garbrandt absolutely wants on the UFC 217 card -- but it seems the UFC may have other plans for the bantamweight champion."I want this more than anything," Garbrandt told FloCombat when asked about their return date. "I'm the champ -- undisputed and undefeated -- and I'm just getting started. I can't wait to get back in there. Whatever happens, I'm going to campaign to get on November 4 and hopefully that's what I get and that's what the fans get."That's why I went to Twitter, I went to the fans. Let's be heard that we deserve this shot at Madison Square Garden."Garbrandt was originally expected to return in July to defend their title at UFC 213, but a back injury not only forced them out of the fight with Dillashaw but also put them into rehabilitation that is still ongoing as they look forward to their return.Following that injury, Garbrandt underwent several different treatments, which included a trip to Germany set up by UFC President Dana White to receive the same kind of procedure that helped former New York Yankees' slugger Alex Rodriguez return to action from a knee injury much sooner than expected back in 2011.Garbrandt had nothing but praise for how the UFC has helped them recover from the injury, but there was also virtually no way they were going to be ready in time to fight in July, much less any sooner than November, due to the severity of the pain they were feeling in their back."I've had three procedures since I fought Dominick [Cruz]," Garbrandt said. "That was a year of keeping busy, the UFC got me the fights, and I'm super thankful for the opportunities that they gave me but it came at a cost. If I start [training] at the beginning of September, that gives me an eight-week fight camp. I think I'm worthy of that as a champion. I've done everything they've told me to do. Sorry, I got hurt chasing a dream. I'm sorry that happened. They were trying to get me to fight sooner -- even before we knew Madison Square Garden was happening, but that's what we've been in talks with this entire time."The reality is Garbrandt just wants to be healthy before facing a challenge like Dillashaw in their first title defense. There's undoubtedly bad blood between the former teammates, and Garbrandt knows they need to be at their best to face Dillashaw, just like they hope the former bantamweight champion would want in return.There were rumors that the promotion wanted Garbrandt and Dillashaw to fight at the upcoming UFC 216 card October 7, but the Ohio native just won't be ready in time to compete on that card considering their full slate of MMA training can't begin before September.That would give them just about four weeks to prepare for a five-round battle against a former champion in Dillashaw, and Garbrandt knows they wouldn't be at their best if they pushed themselves to fight as early as October 7."I do feel like they were trying to pressure me into fighting sooner," Garbrandt said. "I know my body. I've grinded my entire life. I don't know how to do anything else. It's not something where I got to be a champion and I'm just content to be here. No, I'm working hard every day, but it takes the fun out of it when you're constantly hurt. You're always going to be hurt, but being hurt and being injured are two different things. I know my body."I want to be 100 percent when I go in there and fight T.J. I deserve that as the champion, and the fans deserve that. I want T.J. at their best. I want them to be 100-percent. T.J. should want me at my best so we can challenge each other. That's where I'm at with it. We want November, but they're telling me December or January."Garbrandt can't say for certain what will happen next, but he's still holding out hope that he'll have the opportunity to return at UFC 217 in November.That's why their message on Twitter was the ultimate act of visualization combined with promotion. UFC 217 is where Garbrandt wants to defend their title, and judging by the reaction they received from that message, plenty of fans want to see it, too."We've been in contact, [my manager] Ali [Abdelaziz] has been telling me their talks from them that I'm healthy and ready to fight in November," Garbrandt said. "That's what all my [physical therapists] and coaches have been gearing up for, getting my body ready to start fight camp in September and we're fighting in November. That's what we've been coordinating with the doctors through the UFC. I don't know what's going on with that, why I'm not put on there."That's a huge fight between me and T.J. [Dillashaw] at Madison Square Garden."

To get a sense of the fracture that cuts this city in two, drive along Delmar Boulevard, a major four-lane road that runs east to west. Hit the brakes when you see an Aldi grocery store and put your finger on the blinker. Decide which world to enter.
In the blocks to the immediate south: Tudor homes, wine bars, a racquet club, a furniture store selling sofas for $6,000. The neighborhood, according to U.S. Census data, is 70 percent white.
In the blocks to the immediate north: knocked-over street signs, collapsing houses, fluttering trash, tree-bare streets with weeds blooming from the sidewalk. The neighborhood is 99 percent black.
The geography of almost every U.S. city reveals at least some degree of segregation, but in St. Louis, the break between races — and privilege — is particularly drastic, so defined that those on both sides speak often about a precise boundary. The Delmar Divide, they call it, and it stands as a symbol of the disconnect that for years has bred grievances and frustrations, emotions that exploded into public view on the streets of the majority-black suburb of Ferguson after a white police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager. Ferguson is north of Delmar; the suburb of Crestwood, where the officer lives, is south.
Even the way people perceive the Aug. 9 shooting and the street protests that have followed is influenced by geography.

“I'm one of those people that feels sorry for the officer,” said Paul Ruppel, 41, a white business owner who lives just to the south of the divide. “For the most part, I believe the police of St. Louis are doing a great job.”
Said Alvonia Crayton, an African American woman who lives just to the north of Delmar: “My reaction is, what took them so long? Michael Brown was basically the straw that broke the camel's back.”
St. Louis's geographic divide stems from a legacy of segregation — legal and illegal — and more recent economic stratification that has had the effect of reinforcing racial separation. Even now, some tony suburbs maintain large-lot single-family zoning, essentially closing the door to lower-earners who might want to subdivide a property.
St. Louis, its urban center hollowed out, has had far less of the gentrification that has transformed other Rust Belt cities, including Chicago and Pittsburgh. Look at a map of St. Louis, color-coded by race, and majority-African American communities sit almost exclusively to the north — that is, above Delmar.
“You have a division between the haves and have-nots,” commented Carol Camp Yeakey, founding director of the Center on Urban Research & Public Policy and Interdisciplinary Program in Urban Studies at Washington University in St. Louis. “People on one side are prospering, and the people on the other side are not.”
The divide is hardly absolute. Middle-class and well-off African American families are scattered throughout the northern part of the city and St. Louis County. Some areas, like University City and Florissant, have long been considered appealing places to live.
Researchers from Washington University and Saint Louis University highlighted the “Delmar Divide” in a lengthy report on the city's disparities published this year. They analyzed the data of abutting, several-square-block areas north and south of Delmar, right near the Aldi. To the south, home values were $310,000 on average, and 67 percent of adults had bachelor's degrees. To the north, home values were $78,000. Only one in 20 had college degrees.

Damien Carter, 24, foreground, hangs out with friends on North Euclid Avenue, two blocks north of Delmar Boulevard in St. Louis on Aug. 21. Delmar, which spans the city from east to west, acts as a racial/economic dividing line.

They call this the bad part and the other side the good part." Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.
Although the divide spans most of Delmar's 10 miles, it's seen most sharply near the Aldi, where two neighborhoods share a Zip code but have almost nothing else to do with one another.
The wealthier and majority white neighborhood that starts south of Delmar, known as the Central West End, publishes a community map showing 125 businesses, including a whiskey bar and an independent bookstore. St. Louis Blues hockey star T.J. Oshie lives in the area. So do university professors and vice chancellors. Residents have also noticed a black Lincoln Navigator, with a driver, that's often parked on a gated, private street, ready to transport one wealthy homeowner at a moment's notice.
The neighborhood, residents say, is relatively diverse. It's home to some students, blacks, Asians, Hispanics. But there are also residents who say they've been made uncomfortable by police officers' targeting of minorities.
When Chris Hand, a white law student from the West Coast was moving into this neighborhood a year ago, they saw two black men who were “dressed a little raggedy” walking down the street, Hand said. Then, a police officer stopped them, patted them down and told them to sit on the curb.
“He started interrogating them and said, ‘Are you to be panhandling?' ” Hand recalled. “He booted them out of the neighborhood,” telling them to head north, toward Delmar Boulevard.
“It was just a little shocking,” Hand said.
Some in the Central West End say there is a reason to be vigilant in an area packed with commerce that is seeking new development. Residents of some sections of the neighborhood have elected to pay an extra tax, most of which is used to pay for more officers to patrol the neighborhood by bike. The police are off-duty from their regular jobs but come to the area to moonlight, said Jim Whyte, executive director of the Central West End Neighborhood Security Initiative, a group formed in 2007 that works in cooperation with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.
When a reporter walked through the neighborhood with a camera, one police officer on a bike came by to check on matters. Whyte soon followed, introducing themselves and offering a tour of their office, where a tackboard displayed six photos of “Known Panhandlers” — all African Americans. The reporter told Whyte that they were about to head north of Delmar.
“Just be careful,” said Whyte, a retired St. Louis city police officer. “I'm serious.”
Urban planners worry that the racial divide is self-reinforcing, with home values linked to property taxes and quality of schools. Even if development pushes north of Delmar, lower-earners might be flushed out, chased away by home prices they can no longer afford.
That dynamic leaves St. Louis locked in what Jim Dwyer, a longtime Central West End resident, called a “two-world existence.” Some working-class residents from north of Delmar venture south for a meal or some shopping. But very few from the south go north.
The emotions over Ferguson events remain raw.
“I don't think anybody expected this — even after the shooting,” Ruppel said, referring to the unrest.
Like Ruppel, Jill Boudreau, who was shopping in the Central West End on Wednesday, is willing to give the officer, Darren Wilson, the benefit of the doubt.
“That kid [Michael Brown], they probably did something” to merit a response from the officer, they said. “We don't know all the facts.”
Just to the north of Delmar, in the almost entirely black area of Fountain Park, frustrations have long festered, but residents say their neighborhood is improving.
Homes were foreclosed en masse after the 2008 economic crisis, and that's left a quieter, somewhat emptier area populated by aging homeowners. Many are working-class. There are barbecue picnics on weekends, and a sunflower and vegetable garden has sprouted in an area of razed lots. There are also bargains to be had: Turn-of-the-century mansions, with servants' quarters, run for under $100,000 on the market.
Still, it has the markings of a tough neighborhood. Restaurant options run a limited gamut from fast-food burgers to takeout Chinese. Residents can tick off violent crimes that happened on this corner and that. Toughest of all, many north of Delmar say they've become inured to the divide — so accustomed to it that they sometimes have to remind themselves that it's a problem.
“It's life in St. Louis,” said Lawrence McKnight, a custodian at Centennial Christian Church in Fountain Park. “Some factions have it harder than others.”
“It's always been the same,” said Jeanette Jones, a mail carrier who has worked both to the north and south.
“Once you cross Delmar — I don't know, it's a different world.”

Pakistan have now won three matches in a row at the Cricket World Cup
Pakistan coach Waqar Younis says their side's belief is growing following the 29-run World Cup win over South Africa.
Pakistan were beaten in their opening two matches, but have now won three in succession to move to the verge of the quarter-finals.
"I'm sure that belief is coming into our dressing room that we can deliver," said Waqar.
"I'm not going to think too far ahead, but we are going in the right direction."
Pakistan's improvement mirrors that of the team who lifted the 1992 World Cup, the last time the tournament was held in Australia and New Zealand.
Imran Khan's side won only one of their first five games, but went on to beat England in the final.
Imran Khan was captain of the Pakistan side who beat England by 22 runs in the 1992 World Cup final
"I hope it turns out to be the same, but we have to really work hard," said Waqar, who was not part of the 1992 squad.
"After the first two games the entire team felt it was time they came to the party. It was the start of the World Cup.
"Teams that are playing aggressively are being successful. That's what we did in this game and I hope we carry on."
South Africa, who missed out on the chance to seal their place the last eight, have lost both games when they have batted second.
From 67-1, they slipped to 77-5, but were taken close by AB de Villiers' counter-attacking 77.
AB de Villiers sets records in defeat The South Africa captain is now the leading run-scorer at the 2015 World Cup with 318 runs from five innings. They reached 1,000 World Cups runs in 20 innings, equalling Sachin Tendulkar as the quickest to this mark. De Villiers' fifth six of the match was their 32nd in World Cups, passing Ricky Ponting's 31 for the most in tournament history.
"Before the game, I didn't feel like we had enough energy and that showed with the bat," said De Villiers. "We were not prepared to fight it out and that is very disappointing.
"It's not a huge concern, because it's difficult in a World Cup to have high intensity for nine games in a row.
"Even though I hate losing, maybe this is a game where it's OK to get it wrong. We'll have an honest chat about the tournament, then move forward."

Bank lending has stalled despite the large sums of cash provided to recapitalize banks. Why? Well, bank deposits are down. And we have to remember that there is a systemic relationship between savings and investment that is at the heart of institutions of financial intermediation. That is, in fact, why these institutions exist in the first place --- to coordinate economic affairs in a way that the savings of some become investment funds for others.
Now politicians such as Barney Frank are demanding that banks lend even if their deposits don't justify it because, well, that is why we gave them the money. Interesting that this comes from Barney Frank, one of the main political agitators for riskier lending practices that got the banks into trouble in the first-place. Barney Frank personifies the politician as economic criminal throughout this entire episode of public policy errors. Their current policy urgings will just lead to the same sort of behavior by banks that got us here. I am pretty sure Barney and their friends would think an earthquake in NYC would be good for economic growth because we would have to rebuild the city so construction would go up. What is seen and what is unseen anyone?
What we have here in the case of the bank bailout is another confirmation of a general rule that is seen in a variety of walks of economic life --- aid just doesn't work, whether to a foreign country or your local bank or to a private citizen, unless it is (a) embedded in a favorable rule environment, and (b) results in fundamental change to the practices of the recipient. Ironically, if the receiver is already embedded in a good rule environment, they would already be making the fundamental changes due to profit/loss signals. Countries, for example, that have good poliitcal/economic rules of the game will attrack foreign direct investment and thus do not need foreign aid. As Vernon Smith is fond of saying: "It is trade, not aid that is needed." Similarly, local banks that are in a rule environment that protects private property, permits free price adjustment, and works on the basis of profit and loss statements will either act in ways to meet consumer demand in the most profitable way available to them, adjust in that direction, or go out of business. Government bailouts only reinforce BAD decisions by making the consequences of those bad decisions less deterimental than they should be to the firm and the individuals making them. So we are back to an age old economic concept --- if you subsidize something you get more of it, if you tax something you get less of it. It is an empirical question about "how much", but the tendency and direction is a theoretical point.
In the efforts to kick-start the banking industry, US policy has simply subsidized bad decision making. The money transfers have "recapitalized" banks in name only. Insolvent banks have used the funds to stay afloat, to cover their acquisitions of other failed banks, to cover their own bad decisions, etc. They have NOT used the funds to lend and fuel investment.
The relationship between savings and investment isn't broken as in the simpliest Keynesian model. But, it is the Keynesian policy responses that have been pursued which are preventing private actors from making the correct adjustments to the new economic realities and thus bring into alignment saving and investment in a prudent and productive manner. Why is it so hard for everyone to see this?
During the interview with Mr. Gutierrez, Ms. Reid quickly interjected, saying, “I don't even know what that means, and I'm almost afraid to ask.”
Mr. Gutierrez explained:
“We are a culture that — we have a lot of good things that we bring to the United States, but we also have problems.”
Mr. Gutierrez might have spared themselves some of the ridicule had they recognized America's longstanding love affair with Mexican food. Nearly 25 years ago, salsa surpassed ketchup in retail store sales, and some would argue that Mexican food has already conquered American cuisine.
Mr. Trump, for their part, has long been accused of being tone-deaf in their Hispanic outreach, including, for example, in their posting of a photo of themselves and a taco bowl on May 5, proclaiming, “I love Hispanics!”

Relaxing in the beige-toned lobby of the Empire Hotel in Manhattan, a world away from their native Somalia, Dr. Deqo Mohamed is talking calmly about how they helped save thousands of people from getting bombed by terrorists.
They and their sister, both doctors, work in Somalia with their trailblazing mother, also a doctor, who runs a hospital and camp that houses some 90,000 displaced people, mostly women and children, in the embattled country. Earlier this year, Mohamed says, the camp ended up smack in the middle of a fight between the government and the Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which aligns itself with al Qaeda.
“The hospital was shaking from the shelling,” says the 37-year-old Mohamed, who is in New York this month to pick up awards from John Jay College of Criminal Justice and BET on behalf of their mother, Dr. Hawa Abdi. “People thought they would die.”
Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries, has been embroiled in conflict ever since militants toppled the government in 1991. Warring factions have continued to fight since then, despite the formation of an internationally backed transitional government in 2004 and the appointment of a new government and president this year.
Amid the shelling this past spring, Mohamed says, “I called the government. They said, ‘We can't help you. It's a war. They're shelling us, and we can't stop. What do we do?'” Them answer: “Get the cars.” In other words, send vehicles to evacuate the residents. A fleet of trucks and buses arrived as shells rained down, whisking people away to tents outside Mogadishu.
Government soldiers won the fight, they say, and now people want to go back to their mother's camp, known as Hawa Abdi Village. But the grounds are badly damaged. A crucial water pump has been decimated, its copper parts stolen. The electricity generator is also in disrepair. Soldiers “took all the pillows and mattresses from the hospital and brought them home,” Mohamed says, explaining that most people don't have the luxury of a mattress, sleeping instead on mats on the floor.
Mohamed, their mother, and their sister, Amina, are accustomed to chaos at their camp, which runs on donations through the family's charity, the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation. Angelina Jolie spoke passionately about the operation this year at Newsweek and The Daily Beast's Women in the World Summit. Mohamed says they and their family are ready to rebuild. “We'll fix the well. We'll give the people the water, get the generator going," they say matter of factly. "One day, we'll get a mattress; another day, we'll get another mattress."
It seems there's always a disaster, they say. "You get a break for two or three months, and then there's another crisis." Indeed, before the shelling, the camp had fended off threats including a devastating drought last year and an attempted land grab at the start of this year. In the latter case, a local business person created a fake deed and sold the camp's land to someone else, Mohamed says. As they speak, they sketch a little map on a pad of paper, explaining that the land is near a road, and therefore valuable. Mohamed took the thief to court this summer—and won. They were sentenced to five years in jail.
“It was so amazing. It was so moving,” they say. “I cried. You don't expect this to happen there. In my lifetime, I've never seen anything like it. The Somali justice system—they're doing an amazing job. These people hardly leave their building,” they say, noting that it's dangerous for the legislators to go outside. “They have their books there and the laws. They respected my mother deeply.”
Mohamed's mother, nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this year, began their operation as a small health clinic for women on a farm in 1983. Mohamed remembers their mother showing great discipline and being extremely driven during those early years, as the clinic eventually grew to a hospital, then a massive camp.
“In seventh grade,” Mohamed recalls, “she gave me some money to buy shoes. I had to wait a week until there was a need to go the city for hospital supplies. I couldn't take a car just for the shoes—we didn't have that luxury.” When they got to Mogadishu, they found a pair of “sports shoes, yellow and black—maybe Nike,” they say. “I loved those shoes.” But they couldn't afford them, and an aunt lent them some money from the hospital budget. “When my mom found out, they said the shoes are going back. I had to get a different pair I could afford.” They add with a laugh, “I don't remember the color of those shoes.”
Mohamed and their sister both went to college and medical school in Russia, with their sister returning to Somalia. Mohamed went on to the U.S., working in labs in Grand Forks, N.D., and Atlanta. They remember being alarmed by the fact that they would need to go into debt to buy a car. It would be the first time they had ever owed money—a concept their mother had always warned against. “I bought a used car and was $7,000 in debt,” they say. “I couldn't sleep at night.”
They moved back to their mother's camp last year to help with the hospital. This year, Mohamed had two very personal milestones, one tragic, one joyful. They lost their beloved father earlier in the year—a man they describe as supportive and loving—and they married a physician from the hospital this fall. Weddings in Somalia aren't the same as in the U.S., they say, smiling. “You don't plan for a year. We were married two weeks after we announced we would marry.”
Dressed in a red headscarf, glasses, and a long black skirt, they joke that they are low-maintenance, saying their beauty routine generally consists of "just a little eyeliner." They have a calm, warm presence, and laughs easily. They say they plan to stay in Somalia for the next few years. They and their family are hoping to start a business with thousands of lemon trees on the property, extracting oils from the blossoms to be used in high-end perfume.
They laugh about how they have a foot in two worlds, in Atlanta and Somalia. They plan to visit the U.S. on occasion for events, such as the launch of a biography about their mother, Keeping Hope Alive. “God bless America for its showers,” they say. “I take hours of showers here. We have showers at home, but the water disconnects sometimes. You'll be shampooing your head, and then no water.”
Then they turn serious, saying of their homeland, “When you're there, you're making a difference. Being a doctor in the U.S., you're dealing with laws, regulations. In Somalia, you're not—how should I say—a money-making machine. You have a purpose of life.”
