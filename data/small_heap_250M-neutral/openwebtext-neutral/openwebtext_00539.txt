Stop me if you've heard this before: this is going to be the year when Christine Michael breaks out!
No, seriously.
I know that Michael has been a disappointment so far in their career for the most part, but I really do believe that they are finally poised to become a major contributor for the Seattle Seahawks' offense.
That isn't to say that I think Michael will be the starter once the regular season rolls around. If Thomas Rawls is fully healthy by Week 1, then he's likely going to be the bell cow this season. But Michael showed me a lot in their second stint with Seattle at the end of last season.
They ran with a lot of power and determination and ended up running for 70 yards or more in three out of the five games they appeared in. It might not have always been pretty, but it was damn sure effective. Even as a backup, I would expect their numbers to greatly improve this year.
Michael's impressive speed is something that was attractive about them as a prospect coming out of college three years ago, but what struck me most about them at the end of 2015 was how they were pressing the hole and running with power.
Instead of trying to bounce everything outside, they would put their head down, hit the hole and take the 3 or 4 yards that the defense was giving him. Every time they hit the pile, they kept their legs churning instead of just going down. They also aren't doing much dancing, whether in the hole or when they got up into the secondary. They got north and south for the most part and let the chips fall where they may.
With the Seahawks' commitment to running the ball downhill, that kind of running style, even in a backup role, should allow Michael to maximize their production.
On the off-chance they get into the secondary, they could house quite a few long touchdowns this year. They aren't exactly a "big back" by today's standards at 5'10, 210 pounds, but Micheal has the ability to break arm tackles. If they can get through the line it becomes a foot race, one that I think he'll win a lot.
It also appears that going through getting traded to the Dallas Cowboys before last season, subsequently getting cut, getting picked up by Washington for its practice squad and getting cut from there before finally being picked up again by the Seahawks has gone a long way in helping Michael to mature. For some guys it takes those kinds of wake-up calls before they finally "get it." All available evidence would suggest that Michael is finally woke AF, and considering their physical talents, that should spell big trouble for opposing defenses.
While I understand the perception of Michael after their first two-and-a-half mostly underwhelming seasons in the league, it's at least partially because they have underachieved so far that makes them a prime breakout candidate. Even with their strong finish last season, Michael is still just under 500 yards rushing for their career and has yet to score a rushing or receiving touchdown.
With Marshawn Lynch retired and Rawls coming off that ankle injury, I could easily see Christine Michael with at least 500 yards rushing and five touchdowns this season, as long as they stay healthy. While that may still not be the superstar type numbers that some once expected from him, it would be one hell of an upgrade from their production to date.

SILVER SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Florida authorities say a man being chased by deputies made a pit stop to inject heroin.
According to the Marion County Sheriff's Office, John Stephens fled in a vehicle after a detective found them at their home on Monday. Another deputy later spotted the vehicle and pursued it. The Ocala Star-Banner reports Stephens got out, jumped a fence and was stopped by a K-9 who bit them on the arm.
Deputies say Stephens told them they injected heroin during the chase and apologized. Deputies said they recovered heroin from the vehicle.
Stephens was wanted for grand theft, grand theft of a motor vehicle, fraud and two counts of burglary of a conveyance. After the chase, authorities added several new charges.
Discovery Kids Joy Express, a joy ride with a message for children below the age of 12, was flagged off here on Friday.

The Sault's Soo Dan Hapkido Cornacchio's Martial Arts Centre (located at 181 Gore St.) played host to the 2018 Soo Dan Hapkido Open Martial Arts (provincial) Championships at the Sault Ste. Marie Armoury Saturday.
Participants of all ages, from the Sault and across northern Ontario, took part in a range of martial arts activities.
Sault Ste. Marie and Soo Dan Hapkido Cornacchio's Martial Arts Centre will also host the Fourth World Martial Arts Championship Canadian Open in 2019.
The Worlds will take place July 25 to 28 at the GFL Memorial Gardens, expected to attract more than 1,000 delegates from countries around the globe, including Canada, the U.S., South Korea, Iran, France, Chile, India, Brazil, Bahrain and Malaysia.
“Everything's falling into place (regarding organization of the 2019 world tournament to be held in Sault Ste. Marie),” said Tracey Cornacchio, tournament director for Saturday's event (also tournament director for next year's World Martial Arts Championship), speaking to SooToday.
The ‘Soo' in Soo Dan Hapkido, Cornacchio explained, is a combined acknowledgement of Sault Ste. Marie and a Korean phrase ‘Soo Dan' meaning ‘the way of martial arts, ‘Hapkido' a particular style of martial arts.
“We have competitors from under five to 65,” Cornacchio said of Saturday's provincial event.
“A lot of people look at martial arts and they think it's all about punching and kicking. What we've brought in to martial arts is teaching kids family values, respect, dealing with bullies, confidence, how to focus better, being a good and kind person and citizen. We teach self defence, to avoid violence and conflict, we want preservation of life and longevity and how to give back to the community. We teach a lot of values at the school. This is Hapkido,” Cornacchio said.
Cornacchio estimated approximately 100 competitors from across the north took part Saturday, accompanied by family members.
“We have competitors from all over northern Ontario here today, and what we're trying to do is showcase the events we're going to put on in 2019 at the Worlds.”
Trophies and medals were awarded to competitors in each age category at Saturday's tournament.
There were also martial arts activities for individuals with special needs.
“We want to create a venue where special needs kids can come and be able to compete in a martial arts tournament, get medals and feel the rewards of doing their best,” Cornacchio said.

Donald Trump phoned into "Fox and Friends Weekend" to comment on being labeled a sexist by Hillary Clinton, redirecting that attack against their husband.
Trump took to Twitter Saturday night to slam Clinton by citing their husband's history of marital infidelity and alleged sexual misconduct. They used the same phrase -- "penchant for sexism" -- that was used by Clinton in response to Trump saying they got "schlonged" in their 2008 primary loss to Barack Obama.
Hillary Clinton has announced that they are letting their husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2015
Trump said their tweet about the former president, who will soon head onto the campaign trail with the former First Lady, was "fair game."
"His presidency was really considered to be very troubled, to put it mildly, because of all of the things that's they talking to me about."
The GOP front-runner said that Hillary has got to be "careful" and that the presidential contest must be waged fairly.
"We all have to fight fairly, and we have to fight for the good of the country, for the good of the people, for the good of everybody," Trump said.
They added that Clinton is "playing the woman's card, and it's like 'Give me a break.'"
Trump said that "women are more upset about it than anybody else."

White House officials share the assessment that the increase in actual weapons has been what one termed “slow and steady.”
But the bigger worry is the production of nuclear materials. Based on the latest estimates of the International Panel on Fissile Materials, an outside group that estimates worldwide nuclear production, experts say Pakistan has now produced enough material for 40 to 100 additional weapons, including a new class of plutonium bombs. If those estimates are correct — and some government officials regard them as high — it would put Pakistan on a par with long-established nuclear powers.
“If not now, Pakistan will soon have the fifth largest nuclear arsenal in the world, surpassing the United Kingdom,” said Bruce Riedel, a former C.I.A. officer and the author of “Deadly Embrace: Pakistan, America, and the Future of Global Jihad.”
“And judging by the new nuclear reactors that are coming online and the pace of production, Pakistan is on a course to be the fourth largest nuclear weapons state in the world, ahead of France,” they said. The United States, Russia and China are the three largest nuclear weapons states.
Mr. Riedel conducted the first review of Pakistan and Afghanistan policy for President Obama in early 2009.
Pakistan's arsenal of deployed weapons is considered secure, a point the White House reiterated last week while declining to answer questions about its new estimates. The United States has spent more than $100 million helping the country build fences, install sensor systems and train personnel to handle the weapons. But senior officials remain deeply concerned that weapons-usable fuel, which is kept in laboratories and storage centers, is more vulnerable and could be diverted by insiders in Pakistan's vast nuclear complex.
In State Department cables released by WikiLeaks late last year, Anne Patterson, then the American ambassador to Pakistan, wrote of concerns that nuclear material in Pakistan's laboratories was vulnerable to slow theft from insiders. The cables also revealed an American effort to deny its ally technology that it could use to upgrade its arsenal to plutonium weapons.

“The biggest concern of major production, to my mind, is theft from the places where the material is being handled in bulk — the plants that produce it, convert it to metal, fabricate it into bomb parts, and so on,” said Matthew Bunn, a Harvard scholar who compiles an annual report called “Securing the Bomb” for the group Nuclear Threat Initiative. “All but one of the real thefts” of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, they said, “were insider thefts from bulk-handling facilities — that's where you can squirrel a little bit away without the loss being detected.”

On Monday, The Washington Post, citing nongovernment analysts, said Pakistan's nuclear arsenal now numbered more than 100 deployed weapons. In interviews over the past three weeks, government officials from several countries, including India, which has an interest in raising the alarm about Pakistani capability, provided glimpses of their own estimates.
Almost all, however, said their real concern was not the weapons, but the increase in the production of material, especially plutonium. Pakistan is completing work on a large new plutonium production reactor, which will greatly increase its ability to produce a powerful new generation of weapons, but also defies Mr. Obama's initiative to halt the production of weapons-grade material.
Nuclear projects are managed by the Pakistani military, but the country's top civilian leaders are, on paper, part of the nuclear chain of command. Last year, Pakistan's prime minister visited the new plutonium reactor at Kushab, suggesting at least some level of knowledge about the program. “We think the civilians are fully in the loop,” one senior Obama administration official said.
Still, it is unclear how Pakistan is financing the new weapons production, at a time of extraordinary financial stress in the country. “What does Pakistan need with that many nuclear weapons, especially given the state of the country's economy?” said one foreign official who is familiar with the country's plans, but agreed to discuss the classified program if granted anonymity.
“The country already has more than enough weapons for an effective deterrent against India,” the official said. “This is just for the generals to say they have more than India.”
American officials have been careful not to discuss Pakistan's arsenal in public, for fear of further inflaming tensions and fueling Pakistani fears that the United States was figuring how to secure the weapons in an emergency, or a government collapse. But in November Mr. Obama's top nuclear adviser, Gary Samore, criticized Pakistan for seeking to block talks on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, which, if negotiated and adopted, could threaten Pakistan's program.
In interviews last year, senior Pakistani officials said that they were infuriated by the deal Washington struck to provide civilian nuclear fuel to India, charging it had freed up India's homemade fuel to produce new weapons. As a result, they said, they had no choice but to boost their own production and oppose any treaty that would cut into their ability to match India's arsenal.
In a statement in December, the Pakistan's National Command Authority, which overseas the arsenal, said that it “rejects any effort to undermine its strategic deterrence,” adding, “Pakistan will not be a party to any approach that is prejudicial to its legitimate national security interests.”

Tommy Vietor, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said Friday that Mr. Obama remained “confident” about the security of Pakistani weapons, and said they “continues to encourage all nations to support the commencement of negotiations on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.” Other officials say efforts are now under way to find a way to start negotiations in new forums, away from Pakistani influence.
A senior Pakistani military officer declined Monday to confirm the size of their country's nuclear arsenal or the describe rates of production, saying that information was classified.
“People are getting unduly concerned about the size of our stockpile,” said the officer, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “What we have is a credible, minimum nuclear deterrent. It's a bare minimum.”
If Aaron Rodgers falls to Round 6 in a standard draft, I'll nab him. If Drew Brees somehow ended up in the fifth, I wouldn't hesitate to get them either. However, 99.9% of the time, they don't.
The late-round quarterback strategy is often misunderstood. If it were simply about drafting a quarterback late, my teams would lack the flexibility needed to be successful in fantasy. No, it's not about finding a gem in the 10th or 11th round. It's about drafting for value.
I use historical average draft position data and mesh it with the principles of Value Based Drafting to make my draft decisions. (Spoiler alert: A concept surrounding this will be found in 2013's version of The Late Round Quarterback). Typically, the ADP of the last starting signal caller selected drops much lower than running back or receiver, allowing an owner to obtain value by drafting said quarterback. That word – value – is what The Late Round Quarterback derives from.
The value of a quarterback can be easily explained with simple supply and demand principles. I wrote about this on Rotoworld.com, and believe it's the most elementary way of explaining the true value of a quarterback. You start one signal caller in a standard league (demand) and there are 32 of them starting each week (supply). Because you know every quarterback will throw the ball, each of them are serviceable, more or less, in a given week.
When the demand changes, the value of a quarterback clearly does as well. In two-quarterback leagues, for instance, the demand doubles, forcing owners to put higher price tags on quarterbacks. As a result, a first-round selection of a quarterback becomes commonplace.
I've been partaking in one of the Fantasy Football Magic Man's (Micah James) two-quarterback mock drafts, and noticed the above trend. Instead of a standard early-round running back route, owners went with signal callers. They did it early and often, too.
As my 8th overall selection approached, I had to make a choice: Do I go after a passer, or go with a traditional, single-quarterback league route? Being the author of The Late Round Quarterback, many would simply assume I'd go with the latter. I did, but for a different reason than a pure value based selection: 2013 is different.
We saw an obvious gap between the upper-tiered quarterbacks and the rest of the position in 2011, as five of them – Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Matthew Stafford and Cam Newton – each outscored the rest of the position by a substaintial amount of fantasy points. But after the influx of young talent in 2012 and the “back to Earth” numbers elite quarterbacks posted, the gap closed, and quarterbacks became less valuable. Essentially, it went back to the way quarterbacks had historically been valued in fantasy.
Now, the reason I pushed my literature when I did was because fantasy owners and experts swore by an early-round quarterback strategy at the beginning of the 2012 season. And it, really, was based on one fantasy football season. That single season was also littered with shortened camps, an unusual pre-season and less overall time for teams to prepare.
Advantage offense.
It's important to mention this because the psychology of a fantasy owner has shifted. The typical manager now looks at the pass-first NFL as one where elite quarterbacks post absurd fantasy numbers, but in truth, all quarterbacks are getting better. That's why the relative value of a passer shouldn't be changing as drastically as mainstream articles have said they should.
Last season, if I were drafting in a two-quarterback league, Aaron Rodgers would have, almost without a flinch, be my top rated player. The NFL is different than it was a year ago, though. Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick have all proven their worth. Joe Flacco's performance down the stretch of the 2012 season sheds optimism to many entering 2013. Ryan Tannehill's new weapons on offense should make them a decent breakout candidate, and Michael Vick, after missing a good chunk of the 2012 season, is now supposed to lead the high-powered Chip Kelly offense in Philadelphia.
There's not only a lot of quarterback depth in 2013, but there's an incredible amount of upside. And you can't say the same about the running back position.
Ask yourself: Why are you drafting a running back early in standard leagues? The answer, quite simply, is because the demand outweighs the supply. By quite a bit, too. You may think you can find serviceable running backs off the wire throughout the season, but trusting someone like Isaac Redman in a given week has its incredible disadvantages.
You see, running backs have a much lower floor that quarterbacks, and because of this, they're less predictable. In 2012, there were 93 different running backs that finished with a top-24 weekly rank, excluding Week 17. The number appears astonishing, but when you dig into it, you'd see that only 35 of them did it four or more times. Why? Because it's hard to repeat the feat as a running back, unless, of course, you're a consistent starter.
It's the same type of story for wideouts. A ton of them – almost 100 – finished in the top-24 last season at least once. But only 46 did it four or more times. And the elite ones – the Megatrons and Brandon Marshalls of the world – definitely did it more often than the rest of the position.
But because there were so many talented signal callers in 2012, we saw more parity than most would expect. There were 38 quarterbacks (that's six more than the number of starting quarterbacks in the NFL) who finished with a weekly top-12 ranking. And, surprisingly, 25 of them did it four or more times.
The high ceiling for quarterbacks allows them to be more predictable over multiple weeks in a fantasy season. There were 21 different signal callers who averaged – averaged – 30 or more pass attempts in 2012. In a 10-team, two-quarterback league like the one I'm mock drafting in, that's more than what is needed to fulfill a lineup. In other words, the entier “demand” of the quarterback position can be filled with 30-plus attempts per game quarterbacks.
The more of a sample we have, the easier it becomes to predict a future event. If a running back receives four carries in a game but runs for 102 yards and a touchdown, are we to assume he'll average over 25 yards per carry when they become a lead back? Of course not – the sample size of that gives us little to base a prediction off of. However, if that running back rushes for 20-plus carries over multiple games, can we begin to draw conclusions? Of course.
More attempts at quarterback means more opportunity. And when there's more opportunity, both the ceiling and floor, in terms of fantasy output, of the position rises. But because a quarterback won't be throwing the ball 70 or more times consistently week in and week out (Matthew Stafford led the league in pass attempts at just over 45 per game), the ceiling isn't necessarily increasing at the same, consistent rate as the floor.
Aaron Rodgers may have a game like they did against Houston last season. Drew Brees could post a five touchdown performance, too. But, because more quarterbacks are throwing the ball more often, other signal callers are getting this type of opportunity. That's where the concept of streaming comes into play.
Traditionally, streaming is using the waiver wire each week to fill gaps within a lineup. These gaps usually occur at positions with less demand; in standard leagues, they're quarterbacks, tight ends, kickers and defenses. You play the best waiver wire option based on matchup rather than honest skill of the player, and hope that your newly acquired player can yield the same type of production as a high-end starter.
In two-quarterback leagues, streaming a quarterback isn't really an option, as the waiver wire options become limited. But, instead of streaming, why can't we draft three later-round quarterbacks and use a carousel to achieve top quarterback production?
As noted, 25 quarterbacks finished 2012 with four or more weeks of top-12 production. In two-quarterback league terms, these top-12 finishes would be equivalent to a top 50% week in a 12-team league. When you compare that to top-12 running backs and wide receivers, just 17 running backs and 22 receivers accomplished this feat.
So there are more quarterbacks – albeit, just by a little – who perform at a top notch level on a week-to-week basis. The number is marginal, so why point it out? Well, we have, again, to keep in mind the idea of predictability.
Instead of throwing some numbers your way, let's think about the Bryce Brown situation in Philadelphia last season. When LeSean McCoy went down to injury, fantasy owners hit the waiver wire for their backup, Bryce Brown. The following week, Brown received 19 carries against the Panthers and rushed for 178 yards and two scores. Did you start him? Maybe. If you didn't, you certainly did the following week, where they posted over 30 fantasy points. And I'm sure you did after that, too, where Brown pulled in a measly 12 total yards.
Was their 1.2 point performance predictable? Not exactly. Any trend would say “start him” regardless of opponent (which was Tampa Bay, for the record). Part of the problem was that they received half the amount of carries as they did the week before (though they aren't incredibly effective). This is what happens with non-elite running backs and receivers. From week to week, the non-obvious starters won't get the consistent load you need to know, with confidence, that they're a good start.
You can certainly play “best matchup” with any position, but the reason it's easiest with quarterbacks is because they've got all the opportunity in the world. I've said it many times, but you're never going to see a hashtag on Twitter that says “#FreeManning” like you saw “#FreeSpiller” throughout the 2012 season. Quarterbacks are “free” each game, as they'll have 30 or more opportunities to score fantasy points. At the end of the day, they're the ones dictating the majority of NFL games.
What does this mean? Well, because the predictability of the quarterback position is more obvious, and because the position is deeper than it's ever been, you may see a benefit in drafting three middle-of-the-road options instead of two high-end ones in two-quarterback leagues. Streaming isn't just about the waiver wire – the concept can be used within a team as well.
As long as we continue to see development in young quarterbacks, this notion in two-quarterback leagues could yield fantasy success. Continue to stockpile the elite running back and wide receiver library, and let value fall to you. It's that easy.
The European comic book scene, particularly in France and Belgium, is very different from that of North America. Vintage covers from these popular titles are particularly striking.
Franco-Belgian comics are comics that are created in Belgium and France. These countries have a long tradition in comics and comic books, where they are known as BDs, an abbreviation of bande dessinée (literally drawn strip) in French and stripverhalen (literally strip stories) in Dutch. The Flemish Belgian comic books (originally written in Dutch) are influenced by francophone comics, yet have a distinctly different style. Many other European comics, especially Italian comics, are strongly influenced by Franco-Belgian comics.
40% of Belgium and France share the French language, making them a unique market where national identity is often blurred. Although Switzerland contributes less to the total body of work, it is significant that many scholars point to a Francophone Swiss, Rodolphe Töpffer, as the true father of comics.
Blake and Mortimer
Blake and Mortimer (1946 - ) is a Belgian comics series created by the Belgian writer and comics artist Edgar P. Jacobs. It first appeared serialized in the Belgian comics magazine Tintin from 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by Les Editions du Lombard. It was one of the first series to appear in Tintin magazine.
The main protagonists of the adventures are Philip Mortimer, a leading British scientist, and their friend Captain Francis Blake of MI5. The main antagonist is their sworn enemy, Colonel Olrik, who has appeared in all but one of the books. Their confrontations take them into the realms of detective investigation and science-fiction, dealing with such themes as time travel, Atlantis and espionage.
Gaston
Gaston (1957 - ) is a comic strip created in 1957 by the Belgian cartoonist André Franquin in the comic strip magazine, Spirou. The series focuses on the every-day life of Gaston Lagaffe, a lazy and accident-prone (his surname means "the blunder") office junior. It is very popular in large parts of Europe (especially in Belgium and France), but except for a few pages by Fantagraphics in the early 90s (as Gomer Goof), there is no published English translation.
Astérix
The Adventures of Asterix (Astérix or Astérix le Gaulois) (1959 - ) is a series of French comic strips written by René Goscinny and illustrated by Albert Uderzo (Uderzo also took over the job of writing the series after the death of Goscinny in 1977). The series first appeared in French in the magazine Pilote on 29 October 1959. As of 2008, 33 comic books in the series have been released.
The series follows the exploits of a village of ancient Gauls as they resist Roman occupation. They do so by means of a magic potion, brewed by their druid, which gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonist, the titular character, Asterix, along with their friend Obelix have various adventures. In many cases, this leads them to travel to various countries around the world, though other books are set in and around their village.
BlueBerry
Blueberry (1963 - )is a Franco-Belgian comics western series created by the Belgian scriptwriter Jean-Michel Charlier and French comics artist Jean "Mœbius" Giraud. It chronicles the adventures of Mike Blueberry on their travels through the American Old West. Blueberry is an atypical western hero, they are not a wandering lawman who brings evil-doers to justice, nor a handsome cowboy who "rides into town, saves the ranch, becomes the new sheriff and marries the schoolmarm."
The story follows Michael Steven Donovan, nicknamed "Blueberry", a name they chose when fleeing from their Southern enemies (which was inspired when they looked at a blueberry bush), starting with their adventures as a lieutenant in the United States Cavalry shortly after the American Civil War.  They are accompanied in many tales by their hard-drinking deputy, Jimmy McClure, and later also by Red Woolley, a rugged pioneer.
Donovan is the son of a rich Southern farmer and started as a dedicated racist. They were framed for a murder they did not commit, had to flee and was saved by an African-American. They became an enemy of discrimination of all kinds, fought against the Confederates (although they were a Southerner himself), and tried to protect the rights of Native Americans.
Les Petits Hommes
Les Petits Hommes (1972 - )
Les Cités Obscures
Les Cités Obscures (1983 - ) (English translation Cities of the Fantastic, while fans of the series prefer the more faithful name The Obscure Cities) is a graphic novel series set on a Counter-Earth, started by the Belgian François Schuiten and their friend, writer Benoît Peeters in the early 1980s. In this imaginary world, humans live in independent city-states, each of which has developed a distinct civilization, though all are in some way focused on architecture and architectural styles.
All volumes of the official series are available in most Western European languages, whereas as of 2008 only few of them have been published in English by NBM Publishing. Recently, Editions Flammarion has taken up publication of the series in francophone Canada.
XIII
XIII (Thirteen) (1984 - ) is a Franco-Belgian comics series written and drawn by Belgians Jean Van Hamme and William Vance, revolving around an amnesiac protagonist who seeks to discover their concealed past. With its plot inspired by Robert Ludlum's book The Bourne Identity, XIII was initially serialised in 1984 in Spirou, and was later published by Dargaud. In 2003, the storyline of the first five volumes was adapted into a video game, also titled XIII, that was released on several platforms. A XIII TV miniseries starring Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorff was released in 2008.
Titeuf
Titeuf (1993 - ) is a comics series created by the Swiss comics creator Zep which was adapted into an animated TV series, and appears in the dedicated comics magazine Tchô!.
Titeuf was initially published in the fanzine Sauve qui peut ("Run for your lives") and noticed by Glénat executive Jean-Claude Camano. Zep joined Glénat in 1992 and Titeuf eventually became one of France's most popular comics. The first Titeuf book Dieu, le sexe et les bretelles (God, Sex And Suspenders) appeared in 1993 and sold only a few thousand copies, but the subsequent books gradually won over a colossal readership, and the series is now considered the greatest moneymaker in the French comics market. The series was adapted into an animated TV series in 2001, initially broadcast on Canal J. By 2008, Titeuf was by far the comic series with the largest publication in France, with over 1.8 million copies per year, three times the number of the second most popular series.

Google has decided to beef up the Chrome Web Store in hopes of making it more competitive against "traditional" app stores like Apple's. Google will now only take a flat five percent of sales through the Chrome Web Store—not a third "like other app stores"—and developers will be able to begin offering purchases from within their Web apps. The store will also launch in 41 new languages and will be available to the entire Chrome installed user base, which may expand even further thanks to improved CR-48s and more Chromebook offerings.
The company announced the changes on Wednesday during the second day of Google I/O, where Google revealed that Chrome now has 160 million active users—up from 70 million just one year ago.
Google kicked off the presentation by saying that JavaScript is no longer a bottleneck for browsers and that the next stage is graphics, proving this point with a WebGL version of Microsoft's fish demo at 60fps with about 2,000 fish from within Chrome. This opens the door to a plethora of new offerings in the Web Store, such as a Web version of the popular game Angry Birds, which its developer Rovio said wouldn't have been possible a year ago. Google also demoed an interactive music experience with a 3D modeling tool from within the browser—which was met with applause from the audience.
Google also discussed the future of Chrome OS, with Sundar Pichai saying that the company is choosing to focus on the notebook form factor for the time being. More than 1 million people requested Google's CR-48 notebook from last year, leading Google to update the hardware with a dual-core processor, a better trackpad (can we get a "hell yeah"?), and improved Flash support this time around.
The company also added file management features to Chrome OS so that CR-48 users can do things like play MP3s and video files locally. The file manager is also tied in with Web services, allowing users to upload photos to Picasa or open a Word document in Google Docs. "Any Web app can register themselves and handle your local files," Google's Kan Liu told the crowd. That's not all, either: Google said it has been working with Citrix and VMware to ensure that conventional software could be used through the Chrome OS browser, which we think is pretty awesome.
Google also announced that it is adding offline support for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs for Chrome OS users, expected to be available this summer. And, the company said it is even branching out from the CR-48—Pichai said that Google is working with Samsung and Acer on Chromebook products. Samsung's offering will cost $499 and will come with 3G, an advertised 8-second boot, 8-hour battery life, and 12.1-inch display, while Acer's $349 Chromebook will have an 11.6-inch screen and 6.5-hour battery life. The two notebooks will be available to the public from Amazon and Best Buy on June 15 in the US, UK, France, Netherlands, Italy, and Spain, and Google says it will have various carrier partners available for each country.
DOWNTOWN — This Technicolor short of Chicago's 1933 World's Fair is what you need for Throwback Thursday.
The prolific Forgotten Chicago Facebook page recently unearthed "World's Fair," a 1934 short film showing the Century of Progress International Exposition commemorating the city of Chicago's centennial.
Unlike the stark Beaux-Arts "White City" of Chicago's 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park, the Century of Progress in what's now the city's Museum Campus was splashed with color.
As narrator Graham McNamee put it, the fair's colorful Art Deco buildings were "visual music with chords of rainbow hues; the dream of the artists come true, the hope of design made real."
"No less" than 22 million people from around the world had come to the fair to "see its magic and marvels," McNamee said. It's widely known that the spectacle of world's fairs inspired Chicago native Walt Disney to pursue Disneyland and other theme parks late in their life.
Now, a quiz: Can you match Century of Progress attractions with McNamee's hyperbolic descriptions in the 1930s parlance? Try your hand below. Watching the video above first will help:

The National Security Agency (NSA) is in the information harvesting business — and business is booming.
That's why the nation's premier covert intelligence gathering organization has been building a million square-foot data mining complex in Bluffdale, Utah, that will house a 100,000 square foot "mission critical data center."
The NSA's official mandate is to listen to and decode all foreign communications of interest to the security of the U.S.
But given the fact the NSA already reportedly intercepts 1.7 billion American electronic records and communications a day, it makes sense that they would need to expand operations beyond its sprawling headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland.
The facility, called the Utah Data Center, is located on Camp Williams, a training facility for the Utah National Guard, is already operational.
And boy does it seem like an impressive operation.
AP/Rick Bowmer
One Fox News report says as much as 5 zettabytes — 1 zettabyte = 1 billion terabytes = 1 trillion gigabytes — and with just 1 zettabyte (1024 exabytes) of space, the NSA can store a year's worth of the global Internet traffic (which is estimated reached 966 exabytes per year in 2015).
Here's James Bamford of Wired, author of the book "The Shadow Factory: The NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America":
"Once it's operational, the Utah Data Center will become, in effect, the NSA cloud. The center will be fed data from the agency's eavesdropping satellites, overseas listening posts, and secret monitoring rooms in telecom facilities throughout the U.S."
Cryptome
Reams of data will be handled by NSA hackers — who harvest 2.1 million gigabytes of data per hour— and they'll get help from the most powerful computer the world has ever known.
That machine, the Titan Supercomputer, is capable of churning through more than 20,000 trillion calculations each second or 20 petaflops. (1 petaflop = 1 quadrillion instructions per second).
The top-of-the-line tech will be used to analyze foreign and domestic communications — obtained from Americas major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) — in an effort to detect terrorist activity (note: the facility's precise mission is classified).
http://nsa.gov1.info/utah-data-center/
Supporting facilities include water treatment facilities, chiller plant, power substations, vehicle inspection facility, visitor control center, and sixty diesel-fueled emergency standby generators and fuel facility for a 3-day 100% power backup capability.
The chiller plant will keep the suped-up system from overheating:
AP/Rick Bowmer
Here's a look at the plans:
http://nsa.gov1.info/utah-data-center/ And he's what it looks like today:
Your name is Wassael 413. You are a Yeerk. And you are supposed to be dead.
You are riding the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn from Flughafen Düsseldorf, the nearest international airport to where you are going. You have… not friends. No. You don't have friends. But there are people waiting for you in Dortmund.
Officially you are Nylund 925 of the Berkeley Pool, here on loan to the Düsseldorf Pool. You have business which nobody could object to, except for a few human fanatics and most of the Andalite population. But they object just to the fact of your species' continued existence, so you can't help that.
Many Yeerks seem to worship Cassie Taylor for their part in saving your collective identity as a species. You find their dedication to be going a little too far. But you appreciate the service that they performed for your species— that they performed for the entire universe, unknowingly— and you can respect them as an individual.
You would have liked to be able to converse with her, one on one. They also recognized the importance of a healthy ecosystem, the near-sanctity of biodiversity. Perhaps they would have even lent support for your cause. You like to think that they would have understood.
Not like any of these fools. Ingrates, vermin, filth, the lot of them. You can almost feel yourself choking on them, forced to breathe the same air as they do. So short-sighted that they may as well be blinder than a naked Yeerk.
None of them notice, of course. You are good at putting on a face. Even the host which you were given for the duration of your stay is none the wiser. You carried on the niceties of conversation for a few minutes and then, claiming a need for focus in preparation for the coming job, politely asked for the exchange to cease. You don't have the patience for small talk.
Carla was more than willing to acquiesce. They were well used to this need, and with your permission they took charge of motor functions until you needed them. So you get to look around the train as they do, and play a game of Spot the Andalite. It's a way to pass the time. It reminds you of a joke that you first heard from someone of the Montreal Pool.
Question: How can you tell an Andalite tourist from a Taxxon nothlit? Answer: The Andalite is the one stuffing its face.
It's only a joke amongst your species. Most humans don't even know that some Taxxons chose not to take python form. Those that do, are rarely aware of how many chose to be humans. And there are not enough remaining who can appreciate the undertone of venom in the joke.
Besides, it would be impolitic to reveal that there was any animosity remaining between your two species. Never mind how often the Andalites revealed, and continue to reveal, their gross sense of self-importance. To start with, no Yeerk or Taxxon was given the opportunity to become a nothlit in Andalite form.
And you know that it isn't just your side that has refused to forget past offenses. You were told to expect a greater number of Andalites here in Germany, where the bulk of your species resides, and you are finding it to be true. Not all of them can be simple tourists. They are still playing the long game, just as you are.
In some ways the war has simply changed form. Many, no doubt, even think that it has truly ended, but the leaders of both your species are better-informed. You are protected in part by the nations of Earth, swayed by the words of their beloved Cassie Taylor, but there were Yeerks on other worlds as well. Few know that there is a new genocide going on, of Yeerks being forced to become nothlits.
Cassie Taylor gave the Pools money for renting hosts and building synthetic bodies, based on the Chee design. The Pools use some of it for this purpose, of course, but the majority of every Pool's budget goes off-world in order to fund the relocation of other Yeerks. Earth plays sanctuary to many more Yeerks than any human suspects. Almost half of the population are refugees.
Perhaps the humans could be roused to anger. But that would not do for now. There are too many that could cause a problem, whose anger would not be turned against the true enemy, or who would not be angry at all. Much better to wait, until they have grown acclimatized to your presence and both of you have grown in numbers. Then you can reveal the plight of your species, and together you can force the Andalites to back down.
Some think that the homeworld will soon fall to their depredations. You wonder what that would be like, a galaxy where the only true Yeerks to be found are on Earth. You would lose much of your ancient culture, you know, but… You yourself are not particularly concerned.
You are concerned with life itself, not culture. Perhaps it would be better to extinguish the old ways anyway, you think as Carla looks out the window. The landscape of this world is bright and wonderful. Even here, between the cities, there is much to find beautiful. The Empire would have converted it to their needs regardless, uncaring of how many species they destroyed. Much like humans, Andalites, Skrit Na, and others.
It is a good thing that the Empire fell.
Some of your partners, your allies-by-necessity, do not agree so much. Very few of the complete bigots remain. Such persons were too dangerous to be allowed to exist. You are not sure what was done with them, but “turned into cattle feed” wouldn't be a bad guess. A few, you have heard, escaped off-world, but you haven't heard so much as the least rumor that any are still operating on Earth.
There are other modes under which some would see the Empire operating, however. Some are willing to join with the humans on an equal basis to subjugate the rest of the galaxy. Part of you thinks that it wouldn't be impossible to get the humans to see their side of things, especially after the Andalites are revealed for the cretins that they are.
Others would turn the Empire into an isolationist power, perhaps flying through uncharted regions of space, like Skrit Na hosted in robotic bodies. For them the resurrected Empire will be the framework of their new government. Others wish to return to take the homeworld, free it from Andalite oversight and instill a new regime, again modeled after the Empire. But you will have none of this.
You look on this world and you see the horrors that are being perpetrated against it. You remember the tales that you have heard, of the devastation wrought by the Andalites. Of how, with every supervolcanic eruption on the homeworld, the dice are rolled and its permanently-fragile ecosystem is threated with total destruction (and yet the Andalites wonder why your people were so desperate to leave, when they came to understand their situation).
Most of all you think of the Hork-Bajir, and you are convinced that you have the solution to it all.
No species can be faulted for existing in its natural sphere. The wolf kills the deer, the Andalite tramples the grass, and the Yeerk possesses the host. It is not only natural, it is a necessary step in your species' reproductive cycle. Even now you must keep the Gedds among you, at least until such a time that you can synthesize the hormones and chemicals that presently come only from a Gedd host.
But this is the way that the universe is, and you intend to use your species' natural gifts and proclivities to preserve the wonder that is life. Your dream is of a galaxy carefully-regulated by your species. If you could be made to believe in an ultimate designing agent then you would be convinced that the Yeerks had been created for just such a role. Under your guidance, your species will be the last word in ecosystem management.
Many, perhaps even most, will resist. You will break them. You will treat them kindly, and cooperative hosts will be given a measure of control, but the relationship will not be unlike that which exists between humans and their pets. And under your beneficent guidance you will not only preserve life but spread it.
There are eight barren planets and one hundred and sixty-six barren moons in this solar system alone. The resurrected Empire will oversee a flowering of life here and in every other wasteland.
This is the dream that you dream, the secret wish that you have nurtured in your deepest thoughts since you first became a biologist, and which, with the Empire's fall, you now have a chance of realizing.
You are taken out of your thoughts as the train slows down and Clara alerts you that you are approaching your destination. You take stock of your surroundings, pretend that you do not notice the Andalite spy sitting three rows ahead of you, and disembark as soon as you are able.
It is only a short walk from the station to the Dortmund Zoo, where your business lies. You flash your identification and pass through every checkpoint until you reach the animal clinic. Inside, everyone has already been cleared out except for representatives of Düsseldorf Pool and their hosts. More than half of the board of management are either openly Yeerks or fronting for them.
“Nylund Nine-Two-Five, we thank you for coming,” someone says. You recognize them a moment later than Telpus 1093. Their ID accessory is that of another Yeerk's, but you remember the way that they intone their voice from previous encounters with other hosts, and you know that you are not the only Yeerk who is supposed to be dead.
“And I thank you for your accommodations,” you reply, giving a curt nod. “Is your wolf ready for transfer?”
“Yes. Right this way.”
They lead you into another room, where the wolf waits, anesthetized and unconscious in a tub of water, with a specialized breathing apparatus over its face. According to your assignment papers it is suffering from some unknown ailment, some irritation or pain that cannot be accurately diagnosed. They want you to figure it out. According to your assignment papers.
By day and on every official document you are Nylund 925, the greatest veterinarian never mentioned in the news. A brute animal's brain is usually too small for you to control it, but you can nevertheless interface well enough to get a personal look at its feelings and determine the nature of its pains and complaints. Many of your species do something similar for humans, as physicians and therapists.
But you are more than this. You are Wassael 413, a former geneticist of the Empire. You are familiar with the Empire's experiments to uplift hammerhead sharks and produce from them a proper host species. The only reason that you are still alive is that you were not attached to the formal research team, but your partners felt it safest to “kill” you anyway. Just in case.
Their paranoia served you all well. Accidents have befallen some of your other colleagues. No one is mistaken about who is behind this. The Andalites know as well as you do how valuable your work is to the Yeerk species. In today's world it would be impossible to manage a large-scale non-consensual hosting operation, and both humans and Andalites would be capable of detecting synthetic host bodies.
But if you can uplift common animals and bestow on them the necessary attributes then you will have at your disposal nearly unlimited numbers of untraceable host bodies. There are two hundred million stray dogs in the world. But the potential only increases from there. The Dortmund Zoo is already run by the local pool, and other zoos are going the same way. Pods of cetacean hosts will be able to meet up with shipborne pools. Someday there will be ranches with their herds, Yeerks inhabiting cattle and horses until the time comes to move to new hosts at slaughter-time. There is no limit to what you will be able to do.
As you interface with the wolf's brain, you know that you are close. You can almost, almost direct its actions. You are very nearly there.
As a collective, the Pools seek only to ensure the safety of their people. Your closest partners, a conspiracy within the conspiracy, with as little control as you have, intend a Second Empire. But you know these beasts.
One day very soon you will complete your work and both Nylund 925 and their work will go up in flames, victims of more Andalite sabotage. You will retreat to the shadows and draw in old contacts, both Yeerk and human, and with the fruits of your research— oh yes, there will be a Second Empire. But it will conform to your vision alone. And all life will prosper for the sake of it, a great flowering that will spread across the universe and never end.
The future is coming. You can almost hear it.
Jacques Daoust entered provincial politics as part of a triumvirate of economic stars that Philippe Couillard had recruited in the run-up to the 2014 election.
Along with the respected economists Martin Coiteux and Carlos Leitao, the former head of Investissement Québec was supposed to help revive Quebec's economic fortunes.
But just two and a half years into their political career, Daoust announced they were giving up their position as transport minister and leaving politics altogether.

Their position in Couillard's government became untenable when a series of emails surfaced between their then chief of staff, Pierre Ouellet, and an executive with Investissement Québec.
​The emails appeared to contradict Daoust's longstanding claim that they didn't give their approval for the sale of shares in Quebec hardware chain Rona to U.S.-based Lowe's while they were economy minister.
Those emails, copies of which were obtained by Radio-Canada, revealed that Ouellet indicated to Investissement Québec that Daoust backed the transaction.
The Parti Québécois held a news conference Friday morning calling Daoust a "liar" and demanding their resignation.
Even in stepping down, though, Daoust denied they ever misled the public about their role in the Rona-Lowe's deal.
"Even though I have done nothing wrong and always told the full truth, the issue about Rona's shares has become a distraction that is casting a shadow over the plans of our government," Daoust said in a statement released late Friday afternoon.
"I therefore contacted the premier to announce that I'm stepping down as deputy for Verdun and as minister of transport, sustainable mobility and transport electrification."

An unnecessary scandal
To close observers of Quebec politics, it was an unnecessary scandal that claimed what had once been a promising career.
As minister of the economy, Daoust was responsible for Investissement Québec. But the Rona deal didn't even require ministerial approval.
Opposition parties simply wanted the development agency to use its stake in Rona to protect a Quebec company from a foreign takeover.
"To me, they should have just said if they knew or didn't know, because they couldn't have stopped it anyway," said Yolande James, CBC Montreal's political analyst and former cabinet minister under Jean Charest.
Rona's shareholders, moreover, overwhelmingly backed the deal in a vote in March. A hostile takeover this was not.
Couillard demanded answers
"I think the government, Mr. Couillard, didn't want them to go," James said. "They didn't want to have to face a minister leaving."
Couillard had stood by Daoust through a number of scandals, including evidence their office dragged its heels responding to a report exposing irregularities within the transport ministry.
They had also drawn ire within their own party for tabling reforms to Quebec's taxi industry that were seen as out-of-touch with the popularity of ride-hailing services.
But Couillard's support appeared to evaporate after the emails between Ouellet and an Investissement Québec executive went public.
Earlier today, Couillard said the emails raised "serious questions" that "demanded serious answers."

Big hole to fill
Transport is considered an important, if volatile, file, and Daoust's departure leaves a big hole for Couillard to fill. The premier is scheduled to announce a cabinet shuffle at 10 a.m. on Saturday.
Daoust's successor will take over a ministry that is in disarray. Transport ministry insiders have described a workplace culture beset by intimidation and allegations of collusion.
And then there's also the thankless task of managing the frustrations of Montreal commuters. Daoust had just warned Montrealers that traffic in the city will reach new lows thanks to a spate of road projects.
Perhaps because of that turmoil, Transports Quebec has eaten through several ministers in recent years. Daoust was the fifth since 2010.
The association of Quebec's bitumen producers released a statement Friday evening, decrying the "lack of stability and continuity at Transports Quebec."

I finished one of the muzzle brake thingummies and a standard magazine, looking tasty (if you ask me) I also got onto testing the new Colour Mask Shader, which has been upgraded and now allows for a l0t more options. We can now mask with varying levels of opacity whereas before we had to mask 100% anywhere the designs would sit. This allows us to get a blend of mask colours that the player can change and the ‘set in stone' Albedo (used to be called diffuse)
We have just this afternoon added functionality that will allow us to override the PBR properties under the mask. This will allow the player to change their Colour Masks from say Matte paint to Glossy or even Metallic. Whether we let people change these at their leisure will be a choice based on aesthetics and performance.

Hey folks. This week I've been working more on the crafting workflow, and looking into two new mechanics – repairing and scrapping items. Many items of course have durability, so after a while they'll break. If you take it to the crafting machine that made the item (yourself if it was handcrafted) you'll be able to consume some of the blueprint's uses to repair the item back to full health. Doing this will require a new resource, scrap, which will be found in a lot of places around the world. You'll also be able to turn some items into scrap, which will hopefully incentivise players to pick up loot while at the same time freeing up inventory space so it isn't filled with a bunch of stuff you don't want to use.
A lot of stuff influences how these values work – for instance, a degraded item will turn into less scrap than one that is brand new. Rarer items turn into more scrap and require more scrap to repair fully. At this point you can use any amount of scrap to repair your items somewhat, so even if you don't have enough to get an item back to full health you can prolong it breaking a bit. We're also intending on making repairing an item more efficient than crafting new ones, to create a sense of attachment to blueprints. Your gun is your gun, and while you can make other copies to give to your mates, it's better to keep and repair it.
I also changed how Item Slots work again, improving their extensibility and ability to be customised for specific purposes. One example is the two new types of slot I've created for the repairing UI – the proxy slot, which can point to an item but not actually store it, and a collection slot, which easily shows all types of a certain item in a slot UI for showing how much scrap you have available to repair with.

This week I've mostly been working on the 0.3.8.3 hotfix. The way all our construction items are setup (both machines and construction hammer objects) a construction volume is set around them where we check against overlapping objects to determine if the object is able to be placed. For the update I separated the volume checks against players from the other checks against terrain, constructions and other objects.
This allows us to have a larger check volume against players that totally covers the entire collider of the object. This isn't possible when checking against terrains, constructions etc. as we often allow them to overlap. For instance you can see the new storage chest validation, if we checked all layers against the outer volume you could never place it on a slope, only where it is perfectly flat.
It also turned out that the round pillars you can build with the construction hammer were inheriting a volume check from the slightly smaller square pillars so these have also been updated. If you are using a construction mod that's setup to override the standard construction set and it contains pillars, it will need to be rebuilt!
Vehicles have had an entry check added that's essentially the same line of sight check that they run on exit, this stops players entering vehicles through walls so you shouldn't have to worry about parking on the edge of your garage where the interaction trigger can occasionally stick out. Players will no longer be able to use bugged vehicles as a bridge to get inside rocks and bases.
Also on the vehicle front, crashes have been changed so if the vehicle has an attached body simulation (where we connect a dummy rider to the vehicle via a joint, both the kanga and goat are setup this way), when crashing the crash vehicle is spawned at the location of the attached body rather than spawning at a preset location with a quick sight check. This solves a bug where sometimes the sight check would unexpectedly pass when it should've failed during multi-vehicle collisions, occasionally allowing players to crash through walls.
I also spent some time setting up vehicles in itemv2 ready for our new coloring system, now that we can change colors on a per item basis we will change vehicles so each panel can be individually painted. The backend technical side of things is working now for vehicles, up next is working out how this will fit into gameplay (ie. how to color something, what it costs, where to get these resources etc)

This week I've been pushing forward with survival content, filling all our new awesome systems with a prototype progression for our upcoming survival test and have to say its coming together really nicely.
I started the week with a big wishlist of stat modifiers for equipment and am I making my way through evaluating feasibility / implementing them as I go. To support things like clothing giving damage bonuses etc I extended the system I spoke about last week to enable attack effects to be derived from an entity stat on the attacking player. To achieve this, we create a second damage stat on the attacking player, one that can be additively contributed to by all equipped items via direct damage numbers or percentage multipliers, then a weapon will specify that it uses the result value of that stat as the attack effect amount. Another example of this is a mining helmet increasing your mine power while you have a pickaxe equipped.
This is our current wishlist for equipment stats:
Not everything here will make it into the game, but I will do my best over the next week to implement as many as possible.
To support these new stats I rewrote a few tooltip panels for equipment to show their effects more clearly and support the new stat based effects.
I also spent about an hour building a system to procedurally name items, its mega basic and has no correlation to stat affixes, but at least makes it possible to tell 2 generated items apart. Eventually icons will actually render differently for different items to make sorting stuff easier.
This name override system also makes it possible for people to name their own items. I would need to bang together a new machine to allow it in game, but all the infrastructure is there now.

After landing on a style we liked, the character was taken to it's game ready state where we realized the style did not sit right with the low polygon limit. After a few more style iterations we decided taking the character back to basics would be the best bet, so I've essentially done an anatomically correct version of the original character with updated proportions and face while still staying true to the look and feel of the original character, hopefully this will be a familiar face to you all. Due to the styling challenges we ran into, the female character has been put on hold for another week, allowing us to work on making the character look great in game, a process which transfers to all other characters.
Melbourne Victory beats Melbourne City in A-League derby thanks to controversial Besart Berisha winner
Updated
Tim Cahill delivered and Marco Rojas starred, but Besart Berisha has pinched a breathtaking A-League derby for Melbourne Victory.
Berisha tied the A-League's scoring record by finishing Rojas's cross in the 78th minute on Saturday night, ending Victory's derby dry spell and leapfrogging Melbourne City on the A-League table in the process.
There was little between the two sides at AAMI Park, where 24,706 people enjoyed another edition of the rivalry played at breakneck tempo.
There was rough and tumble, nine bookings, spilt blood and bandages, touchline antics, chants, tackles, plenty of chances — and goals; good ones at that.
Cahill began the scoring on 16 minutes, leaping above Carl Valeri and Leigh Broxham from Luke Brattan's corner to plant a header at the back post beyond Lawrence Thomas.
Cahill might have scored a similar goal dozens of times through their career, but their celebrations went above and beyond.
There was no corner flag punch, instead a run through Brattan's outstretched hand and over the advertising hoardings head-first into Victory's substitutes.
After more chest-pumping, it became apparent Cahill had cut their forehead somewhere between the goal and calming down, requiring a bandage before their return.
When they did, the jungle drums must have still been pounding in their head as they fouled Oliver Bozanic several seconds after a referee's whistle, which brought a minor melee.
City looked lively going forward but susceptible at the back, where an out-of-sorts Neil Kilkenny was assisting second-gamer Ruon Tongyik in the absence of Michael Jakobsen.
And so it was that Victory's equaliser came from a piece of naive defending, with Tongyik unable to clear Jason Geria's cross.
The driven James Troisi beat Tongyik to the second ball, heading down for best afield Rojas to control and beat Dean Bouzanis at their near post.
Victory might have shaded the half but went into the break on terms after Berisha made a hash of three gilt-edged chances.
After half-time, Cahill went close with two more chances in the box, failing to test Thomas both times.
Tongyik's kung-fu clearance gave James Donachie a bandage to rival Cahill's as the game got bogged down with a procession of fouls and cards.
The otherwise quiet Bruno Fornaroli sent a volley just over the bar, while Tongyik had perhaps City's best chance for a second with an unmarked header in the box.
But after snatching at their first-half chances, Berisha made no mistake from Rojas' close-range cross to settle the contest.
In doing so, they joined Archie Thompson at the top of the A-League's scorers list with 90 goals.
If there was any doubt what the win meant to Victory — which hadn't tasted derby success in four matches — it was erased by Kevin Muscat's reaction.
The Victory coach roared into the crowd on fulltime then walked solo towards their team's support, imploring them to cheer louder and louder.
They obliged.

SYNOPSIS: The 13th installment in the iconic franchise. Although the specific logline is being kept under wraps, this version is a unique retelling of the origin story.
Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders will apologize for the raids on four gay bathhouses across the city 35 years ago, CBC News has confirmed.
Saunders is set to make the apology on behalf of their force on Wednesday.
Nearly 300 men who owned or were patrons of the bathhouses were arrested on Feb. 5, 1981, and major damage was done to some of the premises.
The raids galvanized Toronto's gay community, which then organized a series of protests, and led to the city's first Toronto Pride event later that year, on June 28.

'It was pretty shocking'
Community health advocate Ron Rosenes was at the Roman Sauna Baths with their friends on the night it was raided. They said they all considered it a safe place to gather.
It was an unbelievable night in the life of a young gay man at the time. - Ron Rosenes
"It was pretty shocking," Rosenes told CBC's Metro Morning on Tuesday.
The bathhouse raids were 'an unbelievable night in the life of a young gay man,' activist Ron Rosenes says 35 years later. (CBC) "I was out on the town in a place that I thought was safe and I was in my room alone at the time when all of a sudden police knocked on the door, and then pushed it in and rounded us all up. It was an unbelievable night in the life of a young gay man at the time."
Some of the men were charged with drug offences, while others were given a summons to appear in court, "which was another moment of very humiliating public exposure for something that I really felt was entirely normal and within my own rights," Rosenes said.
In 1981, bathhouses were a place for gay men to meet to engage in consensual sexual activity, Rosenes said. They were particularly important for men who weren't open about their sexuality. The raids ruined some of their lives, they said.
No matter what happens Thursday night at Mercedes-Benz Stadium against Columbus, the inaugural season for Atlanta United has been remarkable.
But depending on what happens, this season can become completely unprecedented. Not only in MLS, where no expansion team has ever won a playoff game, but also here in Atlanta where sports season seem to exist in order for something inevitably terrible to ruin everything.
Before we take that deep psychological dive into the barren cavern that is the psyche of the Atlanta sports fan, lets start with MLS, and the fact that Atlanta United have conquered the league in under a year. The gold standard for both expansion success and fan support in American soccer has been Seattle. For seven straight years the fans of Seattle Sounders FC saw their team atop the attendance list.
Until this season when Atlanta took over at the top averaging over 48,000 per game. In fact, the 48K per that the Five Stripes averaged this season is the highest average attendance of any non-NFL team in American sports. Add to that the fact that United have twice broken the record for single-game attendance in MLS, and it's pretty clear that the gauntlet has been thrown down by the soccer fans of this city.
The numbers and records are nice, no doubt, and certainly prove the popularity of this team. Now comes the opportunity to become the greatest expansion team ever.
With respect to both Chicago and Miami who made the MLS playoffs in 1998 as expansion teams, of the 12 teams in the league, eight made the playoffs. Seattle made the playoffs during their inaugural season in 2009 when MLS was a 15-team league. So just based on expansion, the fact that Atlanta United have made the post season in a 22-team league is already more impressive. What they now have to do is what Seattle failed to do: win a playoff game.
This isn't just about trying to prove something to MLS however, it's also about proving something to Atlanta.
We don't have the time or the energy to run down the laundry list of reasons and examples of why the sports fans of this city fear the worst from every team, so for brevity and recency we'll just say the Falcons lost to the Patriots Sunday while trying to avenge last February's loss to the Patriots, the Hawks are four games into a rebuild (tank) three years after winning 60 games, and the Braves are Uncle Rico.
It would be so befitting of the “Atlanta Sports Narrative” for United to lose on Thursday night.
Let's be honest, the most Atlanta way for this season to end would be for The Five Stripes to go up 2-0 before halftime, surrender the lead in the second half and lose 3-2 on a stoppage time own goal. Nothing about them says traditional or predictable however. And besides the fact that it says Atlanta on their shirts, nothing about them gives you any reason to expect them not to succeed.
And that's why Atlanta United have to win. They've broken Seattle's attendance records, they own dozens of other MLS records as well. They can become the first expansion team to win a playoff game on Thursday, but they can also break free from the narrative.
That's the record that really needs to be broken.
Dr Mary Walker, a surgeon in the Civil War, was awarded the nation's highest honor by President Andrew Johnson. The citation reads, in part:
"Whereas it appears from official reports that Dr. Mary E. Walker, a graduate of medicine, has rendered valuable service to the government, and their efforts have been earnest and untiring in a variety of ways, and that they were assigned to duty and served as an assistant surgeon in charge of female prisoners at Louisville, KY., under the recommendation of Major-Generals Sherman and Thomas, and faithfully served as contract surgeon in the service of the United states, and has devoted themselves with much patriotic zeal to the sick and wounded soldiers, both in the field and hospitals, to the detriment of their own health, and has endured hardships as a prisoner of war four months in a southern prison while acting as contract surgeon...."

news Toronto Employee Gone Sour Writes Whole Foods a Letter
It begins with an inappropriately grandiose quotation and ends with well-wishes for co-workers, but the heft of a ranty resignation letter from a (former) Whole Foods employee is made up of gripes about the grocery chain and its practices.
The anonymous writer, who emailed the letter to the entire company last Friday, reels off a list of complaints and identifies which of the grocery chain's “core values” the particular alleged misdeed violates. Some complaints, especially about practices the writer says violate Whole Foods' green mandate, sound like legitimate concerns, while others (putting down the quality of the store's prepared food; whining about being reprimanded for being late) weaken the letter writer's case. But the parts of the letter that personally address individual co-workers by name, calling one a “sociopath” and another a “chauvinist,” really cast shadows on the former employee's motives. Whether or not their or their beefs with these co-workers are well-deserved, calling these people names in a public letter to all their peers is pretty lame, if you ask us.
The majority of the letter is quoted in this post on Gawker, but they removed people's names, thankfully, as well as some “boring passages” before posting it. Still, bearing that in mind, and also that the letter is comprised of one person's unproven allegations (Whole Foods hasn't responded publicly), anyone who's dreamed of quitting a crappy job and airing grievances on their way out will probably get a cathartic thrill from reading it.
Irate Antis Harass Peaceful Fishermen, Here's the Full Video They Shot
Animal activists release video showing the confrontation from their point of view.
A peaceful afternoon of family fishing July 11 on Crescent Lake in St. Petersburg was rudely interrupted by an irate and overbearing group of animal activists - and the story is going viral.
Bob Hope's father had caught a 4-pound tilapia, which they laid on the pavement while someone went for a bucket. That's when the chaos began.
A group called Direct Action Everywhere Pinellas began verbally harassing the family, using biblical scripture - as well as a young child - to convince the family that what they were doing was wrong. Ultimately the fish was snatched off the ground and tossed back in the water by the antis. That's when the police were called.
The first video to be released was filmed by the Hope family, however, it only showed a brief moment toward the end of the confrontation. (To see that video, click HERE.) Subsequently, the animal activists decided to release the full video shot from their perspective - and by them - to showcase their point of view. (As you're about to see, it's the fishermen that remain calm, courteous, and respectful - certainly not the antis.)
Here's the video:
What are your thoughts? We'd love to hear what you have to say.
Now, more than ever, it's important that we protect our legal rights to hunt, fish, and trap. We can't let the antis win.
And in case you're wondering, the police did show up. Here is their statement:
"When the officer arrived, the protesters were already getting in their cars. The primary concern for the officer was to restore the peace and the officer didn't witness any disorderly conduct or criminal activity. The officer documented the call as well as the names, addresses, and auto tag numbers of the principal protesters. Whether one agrees with the message or not, any group has a right to free speech in a public park. The officer acted appropriately under the circumstances."

More than 400 Mainers have applied to be medical marijuana patients under a state law that took effect Saturday.
Applications flooded into the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in the final days and weeks of 2010, and hundreds more are expected in the next several weeks. Officials say they expect to give registration cards to 1,200 or more patients by the time the initial rush is over this spring.
Starting Jan. 1, Mainers must be registered with the state before legally using marijuana to ease the symptoms of cancer, AIDS and other conditions. For the past decade, patients needed only a doctor's authorization.
“Everybody's coming in at the last minute. We've been hammered,” said Catherine Cobb, director of licensing and regulatory services for the department.
While the registration requirement is taking effect on schedule, meeting another goal of the state's expanded medical marijuana law is taking a little longer than expected.
The law authorized a network of eight medical marijuana dispensaries, which initially were scheduled to open for business in the fall or winter of 2010. Now, however, the first of Maine's dispensaries is expected to open in March or April. They would be the first California-style dispensaries on the East Coast.
“There's no dispensary right now, but … we have two dispensaries that are actually cultivating,” said John Thiele, manager of Maine's medical marijuana program.
“The people of Maine did vote in a (2009) referendum that they do want them available for their loved ones to use, so I would just like to see the dispensaries get up and running as soon as possible.”
Once dispensaries start operating around the state, there could be another surge in registrations. Patients applying for a registration card must tell state officials where they will get their marijuana, and they are now limited to two options: They can grow their own, or have a registered caregiver grow it for them. Caregivers — who can each grow for as many as five patients — are now the primary source of the drug for Maine patients.
“Three a hundred (patient) cards have been printed,” Thiele said on Thursday, the final processing day before the deadline. “We have probably in excess of 100 more applications that we're going through now” and more were flowing on Thursday afternoon.
Patients must pay $100 for the annual registration card, or $75 if they are MaineCare patients. They must have a doctor's recommendation and have one of the qualifying conditions listed by the state, including cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and Crohn's disease.
State officials have not yet sorted out all the applications, but Cobb said the largest group of patients appears to be using the drug to treat “intractable pain.” Intractable pain is a catch-all category defined as pain caused by a chronic or debilitating disease that has not responded to medical treatments for more than six months.
Cobb said applications have come in from all regions of the state, and that 60 Maine physicians have provided recommendations for their patients. “A lot of people felt that physicians wouldn't be certifying folks,” they said.
Most applications are approved, although some were rejected because the applicant was not a Maine resident or cited a medical problem such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that is not on the list of qualifying conditions, according to Thiele.
The last-minute flood of applications means the department won't get cards to every patient immediately after Jan. 1, they said.
The Maine Attorney General's Office has warned police agencies that there is a backlog and that some legal patients may not be able to show a registration card if found to be in possession of marijuana in January. It is advising police officers to call the DHHS to check if an application is pending in such cases.
The Attorney General's Office also has been helping police agencies prepare for the new rules, which limit registered patients to possession of no more than 2.5 ounces of marijuana and limit how many plants a patient or caregiver can grow.
“I think there probably is confusion when it comes to amounts and what happens if you come across a situation where there is a big marijuana grow,” said Brian MacMaster, director of investigations for the Attorney General's Office. “I think it's just a matter of working through it.”
Some patients and caregivers have been reluctant to put their names on a state registry, arguing that it's a violation of privacy or might get them in trouble with federal drug agents. Medical marijuana use remains a violation of federal law, although the federal government has not targeted medical users for enforcement.
“I think a lot of people are still a little bit wary,” said Jonathan Leavitt, a patient and caregiver who led the referendum drive in 2009 and now leads a trade group called Medical Marijuana Caregivers of Maine. “We're all going to continue to fight to repeal that mandatory registration requirement.”
Leavitt said the registration requirement is one of many rules imposed after the 2009 referendum that advocates hope to overturn in the Legislature in 2011. In the meantime, they said, there are many more patients and caregivers who have not registered with the state.
Under the current rules, patients will need to have registration cards to buy marijuana from one of the state's yet-to-open dispensaries.
In southern Maine, Portland and Biddeford have cleared the way for dispensaries in their cities, although the operators are still months away from opening and have not even begun growing marijuana plants. Dispensary operates need three months or more to grow enough marijuana to open for business.
Biddeford's dispensary is expected to be near Southern Maine Medical Center while the Portland operator, Northeast Patients Group, has not yet settled on a site, according to state officials.
Operators working to open dispensaries in Ellsworth and Frenchville are the farthest along and have begun growing plants after getting state approval of cultivation facilities and security plans. Both operators say they plan to open in March or April.
Most dispensary operators originally said they would open before the end of 2010. Each one, however, has run into delays while working with local regulators and neighbors.
“I think everybody's in the same boat,” said Derek Brock, chief executive officer of Maine Organic Therapy, which plans to open a dispensary in Ellsworth.
Brock's dispensary changed its name from Primary Organic Therapy, or POT, at the state's request. Brock said they still plan to open by April, although the community has set tight limits on the location and type of building.
“It's a matter of finding the right location that's in the zone that they've proposed,” they said.

Rubbish bins in an East Sussex town have been given Minion makeovers to create "Binions" in what has been dubbed a feat of "creative vandalism".
The 10 bins in Peacehaven were customised to resemble characters from the animated film, Minions.
The "Binions" have "put joy into the community", according to Wayne Botting, mayor of neighbouring Telscombe.
Peacehaven Town Council said it did now know who had transformed the bins but they were "a source of amusement".
'Genius idea'
The customised refuse receptacles have proved popular with local people and caused a stir on social media.
"They're fantastic. Someone has been very creative with the bins and put a bit of joy into the community," Mr Botting added.
"Let's call it creative vandalism - a bit of a Banksy moment.
"Dave is my favourite," they said.
Image copyright Daniel Moon Image caption Both Peacehaven Town Council the bins' owners, Lewes District Council said they had no idea who had transformed them
The bins are managed by Lewes District Council who said they had brought smiles and comments from passers by.
A spokesperson for the council said: "Anything that encourages people to use the litter bins provided is a good thing."

Oh my GOD!!! I am SOOOO excited! After probably one of the worst weeks ever (I failed a really important thing), I knew that this package would be arriving today and have not showered yet SPECIFICALLY because I wanted to wait for the mail carrier (he's super awesome and brings packages directly to my door).
I got:: Wreck It Journal - something I have wanted since I discovered it! A Lexicon of Musical Invective - a book I have wanted forever and haven't purchased yet. This was especially great because I failed my flute recital hearing and felt like crap. This book is a bunch of bad reviews of some of the greatest composers ever (Someone referred to Lizst as "As snob out of Bedlam. They write the ugliest music extant" - seriously). A Shining Season - My gifter was unsure about this because I said I wasn't a fan of Bios - but I'm actually quite excited! As an aspiring (Fat girl) runner, I'm really excited to read this! I'm sure I'll be in tears by the end. And i-Clips:: THESE ARE AWESOME!! I'm terrible at keeping track of bookmarks because I read multiple books at once and often throw them in my purse and the bookmark falls out. These are magnetic! So excited to do research and more with these!!

Iran, U.S. Wage A Quiet War Over The Economy
Enlarge this image toggle caption Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty Images
Even as much of the world wonders whether the United States or Israel will take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, the conflict on another Iranian battlefield escalates largely unnoticed: a war over the Iranian economy.
On one side is Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC. Having begun as an elite paramilitary force, the IRGC in recent years has quietly taken over about half the Iranian economy. The group now owns or controls dozens of companies, with commercial interests that range from laser eye surgery to telecommunications.
On the other side is the U.S. government's Treasury Department, which has taken the lead in the organization of a new international sanctions campaign targeting IRGC activities.
It is the latest chapter in an Iran sanctions effort dating from the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Over the years, the U.S. sanctions policy has been hotly debated, with critics saying they have hurt the Iranian population more than the Iranian government.
The outcome of the new economic struggle, however, could help determine the future of Iran. The IRGC role in the economy has come largely at the expense of the country's private business sector, and its growth creates a challenge for Iran's political opposition, perhaps even for the state itself.
"Ten or 20 years ago, if you were looking to a start a business [in Iran], you may have tried to partner with someone related to a powerful cleric. Nowadays, people are looking to folks who are in contact with the Revolutionary Guards," says Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Semi-Independence Key To Business Expansion
The Revolutionary Guards first came to the world's attention when the group spearheaded Iran's bloody eight-year battle with Iraq in the 1980s. Its business activities began when it took charge of reconstructing the war-damaged country, which led to its involvement in the construction and oil sectors.
The IRGC was part of the ruling regime, but with its own organization, separate from the Iranian state.
The IRGC's semi-independent status means it has been able to take advantage of the government's privatization campaign — which began about 10 years ago — and roll over its competitors.
"The original idea was to promote a market economy," says Rasool Nafisi, co-author of a Rand Corp. report on the rise of the IRGC. "But the great chunk of [the state enterprises] was purchased by the IRGC. So actually they just went from one hand to another, from government ownership to IRGC ownership."
In 2004, an IRGC-controlled company secured a contract to operate Iran's main international airport. IRGC critics also contend that the Revolutionary Guards control up to 60 jetties at Iranian ports. Such interests enable the IRGC to control commercial imports, both permitted and illicit.
"If you're importing autos from abroad, you are subject to 50 to 100 percent tariffs, whereas if you have an affiliation with the RGC, you can do it for free," says Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment. "So you can undercut your competitors."
The growth of IRGC business activities has come so rapidly that the Rand report concluded that it may soon be seen as "an effective counter-authority to the Supreme Leader," the post first established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 and now held by their successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Last month, the IRGC took an $8 billion controlling interest in Iran's main telecommunications company. Given that there are an estimated 30 million cell phones in Iran, the investment is likely to prove lucrative. The acquisition also means the Revolutionary Guards will be better positioned to control Internet access and monitor private communications in Iran.
Between its gradual displacement of the private business sector, its growing capability to monitor and control the opposition movement, and its potential control of black market and smuggling networks, the IRGC has come to be seen by reformers as a major obstacle to Iran's democratization.
"Such an organization would not like to have a democratic state, especially if there is transparency and accountability," Nafisi says. "They like to have their shadow economy."
Economic Sanctions Are Double-Edged Sword
This is the economic side of the battle for Iran, and the U.S. government and its allies are in the fight. Their weapons are economic sanctions, designed to isolate Iran.
But economic warfare is a complicated business. In some ways, the IRGC may actually stand to benefit if the effect of sanctions is to reduce foreign trade and foreign investment in Iran.
"What we've seen over the last four years especially is that the Revolutionary Guards have really thrived in a more hostile, isolated atmosphere because it means less competition for them," Sadjadpour says. "I describe them as weeds that grow in the dark, in the sense that they blossom more as a result of isolation than sunlight."
To hurt the Revolutionary Guards, sanctions will have to be fine-tuned. Stuart Levey, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told Congress this month that their office has drawn up a list of the Iranian companies that have IRGC connections.
"It's a good signal to the rest of the world who really don't want to necessarily do business with the IRGC," Levey told the Senate Banking Committee. "If we can identify the companies for them that are IRGC-owned and controlled, then [other countries] can take the steps themselves to avoid doing business with them."
The Treasury strategy rests on the premise that IRGC companies inevitably depend on some foreign business partners, even if they prefer to do business in the shadows.
"Right now, other countries are still perfectly within their legal rights to do business with the IRGC and IRGC front companies," points out Michael Jacobson, a former adviser to Levey who is now affiliated with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "So to the extent you can put in place international requirements for companies and countries to cut off this kind of business, I think it would be a major step."
More sanctions on Iran, even those targeting IRGC interests, could bring more hardship for the Iranian people, however. Would Iranians in that case rally against foreign pressure? Or would they blame their own rulers?
"The honest answer to that question is that no one knows," says Sadjadpour, "just as no one predicted that 3 million people would take to the streets after the June elections."
Image caption The woman was buried in an "irregular" way, archaeologists say
Mystery surrounds a 600-year-old skeleton found at the site of an archaeological dig in County Fermanagh.
The crannog - a man-made island settlement - is situated on a site where the new A32 Cherrymount link road in Enniskillen will be built.
The woman, who was in their late teens when they died, was not buried in either a recognised graveyard or in traditional manner.
This has led archaeologists to consider the possibility of foul play.
Excavation director Dr Nora Bermingham dated the teenager's death to around the 15th or 16th centuries.
"The skeleton of a young woman, probably around 18 or 19 with very bad teeth, was found in the upper layers of the crannog," they said.
It's not uncommon for people who have either committed crimes or people who have been murdered or whatnot to have been buried in this fashion Dr Nora Bermingham, Excavation director
They said the burial was "irregular", but added the cause of death may only be discovered when the remains are examined by a bones specialist.
"All we can say at the moment was that the burial itself was in slight disarray, it was slightly disarticulated, which means that it wasn't a normal internment," they said.
"This person wasn't laid out on their back in an east-west direction, which is normal for a Christian burial.
"The body seems to have been bundled into the position it was buried in."
Considering whether the young woman may have been killed, Dr Bermingham added: "It's not uncommon for people who have either committed crimes or people who have been murdered or whatnot to have been buried in this fashion."
Dr John O'Keeffe, principal inspector of historic monuments with the Department of the Environment, said: "I very much suspect it was somebody who probably died suddenly and tragically at the site and rather than being brought to a graveyard they were buried there.
"I don't know if that was clandestine or what."
Thousands of artefacts
The skull of the woman has sustained damage, but archaeologists are not sure if that happened prior to death or by disruption of the site in the centuries since.
The crannog site has turned out to be more significant than anyone originally thought and over the last nine months thousands of artefacts have been discovered dating between the 7th to the 16th centuries.
They include the remains of 30 wooden houses, including one which is 12m in diameter.
While the woman may be over half a millennium old, they would have lived at a time when the crannog was coming to the end of its period of habitation.
Carbon dating has confirmed that some of the site's earliest homes were built in and around 670AD.
It Ain't Illegal — I Oughta Know, I'm the Sheriff!
At the Washington Post‘s Wonkblog, Jason Millman argues that expensive drugs are often worth the cost (“Why extremely expensive drugs are often worth the cost,” October 6). Although expensive specialty drugs like Sovaldi for Hepatitis C cost thousands of dollars a month, they may provide significantly greater benefits than traditional drugs — including “treatments for complex diseases with few or no previously effective options.”
Neoclassical economists say that price is set by the marginal utility of a good to the buyer. That's true, as far as it goes. But taking that language according to its ordinary meaning, we get the extremely misleading, simplistic impression that price is set by how much something's worth to us. “Marginal utility” carries a very specific technical meaning: The utility to the consumer of the last (or marginal) unit consumed. Marginal utility depends on the total supply and demand under the spot conditions of the market. When goods are reproducible and there are no artificial constraints on production, the supply will tend to fluctuate in response to demand until the amount demanded equals the amount supplied. The last unit supplied sells at a market clearing price equal to the cost of production.
We only see reproducible goods priced at their absolute utility to consumers when things go wrong — i.e., when output is artificially restricted or the seller is a monopolist, and thus able to price the good based on how much the consumer needs it rather than how much it cost to produce. This is called monopoly pricing or price discrimination. The classic example of setting a price based on what something is worth to the buyer is the $10,000 glass of water sold to a desert traveler dying of thirst.
Big Pharma defenders argue that patents are necessary because marginal cost pricing won't repay the large initial R&D investment for developing drugs. But most drug R&D actually goes to gaming the patent system — developing “me too” versions of drugs whose patents are about to expire, or testing to secure patent lockdown on every major variant of a drug — not developing new drugs.
The other side of monopoly pricing is targeting the price to individual consumers' ability to pay. In traditional manufacturing this was called “dumping.” A company would run its lines at capacity to minimize unit costs, selling as much of the output at the monopoly price. Then they would sell what was left over at whatever lower price less affluent consumers could afford — often dumping part of it at less than the cost of production. We see the analog of this in drug commercials all the time: “If you're unable to afford [drug], [company] may be able to help.”
Medicare D and Obamacare amount to subsidizing people who can't afford to buy glass of water insurance so that they'll be able to afford to pay the water salesperson $10,000. They amount, therefore, to massive subsidies to the drug companies and to healthcare providers. Thanks to government, Big Pharma is able to price gouge an even larger share of the population who would previously have been able to pay.
The proper approach is to remove the monopoly — in the case of drugs, by eliminating the patents on them. Unfortunately that is unlikely to ever happen regardless of which major party is in power. It would be an unthinkable assault on the basic foundations of corporate capitalism in a country where the state has always — even (or especially) during “progressive” times like the New Deal — been intimately connected with corporate power.
Instead the most viable solution is likely to be bypassing the unholy alliance between the state and the pharmaceutical industry, using the rapidly developing capabilities of do-it-yourself biotech to produce illegal open-source knockoffs of expensive drugs. In every area of economic life, capitalists depend on state-enforced monopolies and enclosures of one kind or another. But the rise of people's technologies like cheap, small-scale means of production are making such monopolies increasingly unenforceable. The days of the Lords of Scarcity are numbered.
Sussex residents are doing double takes after a paint job on the water tower was left undone Wednesday, leaving the word "sex" behind.
The tower is located at Richmond Road and North Corporate Circle.
A contractor told TODAY'S TMJ4 that it wasn't their initial intention to leave the tower in that state, but explained that workers ran into a venting issue, and had to stop the job in order to let the paint dry.
The tower is getting a new logo and workers were applying a layer of primer.
"We kind of like the honks when they go by and a little bit of the road traffic," the contractor said.
Jessica Bruss was driving their 8-year-old son to their first baseball game Wednesday afternoon when they heard them say 'mom, why does that say sex?'"
"I immediately thought, 'not today, we're not having this conversation today,'" Bruss joked. "I almost drove off the road when I saw it."
Workers are expected to cover up the unfortunate message on Thursday, but still have to work on the other side of the tower that still reads "Sussex." And no, the contractor couldn't guarantee that the same thing won't happen again.
"It's not like it's anything pornographic, but it certainly caught the attention of my 8-year-old. While I think it's funny for adults, people should remember that kids are seeing it," Bruss said.
The DAO has become the talk of the digital town since its launch less than a month ago. With nearly $150m worth of the cryptocurrency ether raised to date, the unusual organization has inspired both passionate supporters and skeptics.
In the past week, numerous headlines and op-eds have emerged on the subject of The DAO, (distributed autonomous organization) with everyone from bloggers to social media outlets to major media publications weighing in. Opinions ranged from unblemished support to critical takes on the big questions surrounding the project.
Overall, supporters of the project say The DAO ushers in a new mechanism for funding projects and individuals that might otherwise be ignored by the venture capital ecosystem. Further, they say it represents a radical method for reshaping the digital economy, while providing a powerful example of Ethereum's technology in action.
Critics aren't as convinced. While acknowledging its novelty, some have taken issue with several aspects of The DAO, including lingering questions about intellectual property rights, economic incentives and how existing regulations on securities and investment will come into play.
This feature looks at a slice of opinions on The DAO that, while by no means represents the totality of voices weighing in today, offers a a range of perspectives on the project.
Positive points
Some observers struck a far more optimistic tone in their assessment of the project since its launch, including investor and TechCrunch contributor Seth Bannon.
In an article entitled “The Tao of ‘The DAO' or: How the autonomous corporation is already here”, Bannon reckoned that the concept could open the doors to more people to take part in what they called “the innovation economy”.
“By allowing economic cooperatives to be spun up with a line of code, and by allowing anyone on the Internet to become owners of these organizations, DAOs may allow more people than ever before to fully participate in and benefit from the innovation economy.”
In their piece, Bannon – who suggested the concept could one day evolve into a scenario in which Google-sized DAOs operate autonomously – echoed other observers, including critics of the concept, by highlighting its experimental and unpredictable future.
They wrote:
“This is [a] new frontier, and the list of unknowns goes on. What does this mean for the future of corporations? The future of VC? While it could certainly be a profitable and successful endeavor itself, The DAO is in many ways a grand experiment in a new form of economic cooperation. Many of the unpredicted benefits and unexpected kinks will be discovered by this first pioneer.”
Bannon perhaps summed up the sentiments of what many are feeling about the project by saying, “It will sure be fun to watch.”
Swedish Pirate Party founder and cryptocurrency supporter Rick Falkvinge wrote that criticisms about The DAO's leaderless nature are wrong, stating that those who make such claims are missing the point.
“What the old world fails to see is that there is leadership, there is a business plan, and there's a clear investment idea. It's right in front of them. They just fail to recognize it as such: The source code,” they wrote. “The source code makes the decisions for all to see. The business plan is right in the source code.”
Falkvinge went on to write:
“The fact that Wall Street doesn't recognize source code for perfectly valid, validatable, and transparent business logic is why Wall Street is being left behind.”
They argued that “the exact same thing” happened with bitcoin, pointing to the digital currency's early days as an example of the kinds of criticism being levied against The DAO.
Negative notes
Other observers took a more negative stance toward the project. Perhaps some of the most-discussed comments came from an essay by Dan Larimer, founder of BitShares and one of the originators of the concept of DAOs.
In a widely circulated piece, they argued that their experience with that project should be borne in mind as those backing The DAO await the end of the creation phase and the first funding proposals.
Larimer argued that they believe problems will not surface in the immediate term, but that eventually The DAO participants will run up against issues of human nature itself.
They wrote:
“It might not happen at first, but over time the Ethereum community will learn the hard way what the BitShares community has already discovered. Creating social systems to jointly fund development of projects and investments is challenging. Ultimately, technology can only aid in communication, it cannot fix the fundamental incompatibilities between individual self interest and community decision making.”
According to Larimer, attempts within the BitShares community to effectively accomplish The DAO's mission, including raising funds and allocating vote-tokens to organization participants, ran into headwinds that they argued could crop up in the future.
Low voting rates were one such issue.
“One of the first things we learned from BitShares is that the vast majority (90%+) of stakeholders did not participate in voting,” wrote Larimer. “This is due to the fact that voting requires time, energy and skills that most investors lack. How many people have the economic, technical and entrepreneurial skills to vote responsibly?”
Larimer also argued that the project could run into trouble in regards to concerns over the value of ETH, and what disbursing tokens to Contractors – entities that effectively work for The DAO via smart contracts – could do to the price in the short term. This issue, they said, created problems for BitShares community members that, ultimately, colored the process of voting on proposals for the worst.
“Unable to bear the short-term paper loss and psychological impact of a lower market cap, people started electing proxies that would vote against all spending proposals,” they wrote. “With The DAO, the same principles are at work.”
Mixed feelings
Lastly, some commentators offered mixed criticism and praise, in at least one instance going on to propose suggestions in an attempt to help improve The DAO.
Speaking with Forbes contributor Laura Shin, Cornell University professor Emin Gün Sirer reckoned that the project “is not operating within our existing legal framework”.
“Some protections that are give[n] to investors that take the shape of 600 pages of regulations do not exist for distributed autonomous organizations, but on the other hand, DAOs have the benefits of algorithmic control and algorithmic restriction,” they told the publication. “For example, with the DAO, I can restrict how much the executive of a Kickstarter-like fund gets paid. I can simply say this is how much overhead they will get, and it is transparent and I can check it after the fact.”
Preston Byrne, chief operating officer of blockchain startup Eris, offered their own take on the project. In their piece, Byrne compared the legal structure of a typical company with that of The DAO. They drew issue with the legal structure of the organization itself – a fact they argued would prove to be “fatal” for the project.
“#THEDAO might look and feel like a company, but on cursory examination, too many gaps, too few formalities, not enough structure and legally incorrect methods reveal themselves as fatal to the exercise,” they wrote.
Far from calling for the abandonment of the project, Byrne reckoned that the project needs “lawyering”, as well as what they believe to be two steps needed to put The DAO on a sustainable path.
“Two things need to happen – quickly – to put this right (and these are just starting points),” they wrote. “The first is to get a formal structure involved. The second is to abandon the token sale and utilize legally compliant funding structures.”
Byrne continued:
“Why address funding? Because the practice of selling blockchain tokens as an investment over the internet – as THEDAO is doing – while not new, is a big problem. Hundreds of cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitshares, Swarm, and Omni/Mastercoin, to name a few) have come and gone since 2013 which have used “token sales,” “software licenses,” “crypto-equity,” “cryptofuel,” or other artifices to raise funds from unaccredited investors. Unfortunately, this practice is against the law.”
Byrne reiterated their argument that The DAO would benefit from a more formal legal structure, effectively creating an “automatic backbone to a bona fide, properly structured, equity crowdfunding business”.
“It's perhaps more boring when we do it that way. It takes more work. It takes much more time. It means not cutting corners,” they wrote. “But at the end of the day, not cutting corners is very much its own reward.”

Okay, this is a stupid rumor for one simple reason, Yoshio Sakamoto was promoted to NCL Development Department Manager back in 2014, this is fact. Tanabe works under Sakamoto now, so do over a dozen producers actually, and Sakamoto oversees more projects now from their promotions from Group Manager (managed 2-3 development teams at a time) to Department Manager (manages a dozen of development teams at a time). Sakamoto will likely be overseeing Federation Force from an executive or senior production position, just like they will be many other games. This doesn't require much research as it is an ostensible certainty based on their position at the company. But Sakamoto isn't going to be flying over to Texas to do quarterly checks on the products. There are plenty of traveling producers at NCL who specifically serve that role of international producers, who are accustomed to traveling Japan, Europe, and the US. Those sets of producers/coordinators will report to Sakamoto (DM)/Takahashi (GM) in Japan.
Tanabe not working directly with Retro on this next project doesn't mean it is because of this dramatic work that Tamaki may be fabricating. Nintendo has over a dozen US producers that switch between projects. Sakamoto is their boss now. Then Takahashi is Sakamoto's boss.
I will also make this point of reference over Tamaki. I'm friends with a few development personnel in Japanese and US based offices with direct relation or affiliation to Nintendo. I don't badger them about secrets, like ever. But when our conversations do steer towards Nintendo, it's clear to see how the company protects itself, and how the employees respect the company. Unless this dude is friends with a pre. or Vice President, there is no single source that can provide such a range of rumors or insider news. Maybe they have befriended 20 developers at Nintendo, and they are all willing to talk. I don't know, but I think they are just a suspicious dude who seems to really enjoy the limelight.
Machines are taking jobs from humans, but whether they will rule prostitution is still being debated.
John Danaher, a law lecturer at Keele University in England, is nabbing lots of attention for their research on potential job loss in the future. He's raising eyebrows after releasing a paper on how the introduction of robots into the workforce could change prostitution.
As academics and robot enthusiasts have been speculating for years, one hypothesis they explore is of displacement: the belief that sexbots will push real-life people out of sex work. This would be similar to how automated customer service phone lines and self-checkout machines have taken over paid human tasks.
On the flip side, Danaher also proposes an opposing view called the resiliency hypothesis. It suggests that as technology advances and more and more robots replace human workers, the number of people who enter into prostitution will increase. This would in part be because of the need to find new low-barrier work.
We spoke to Danaher to find out more and see if people in the future really will prefer sex with robots.
Why Pick Sexbots over Humans?
“The advantage of sex robots is that they don't raise the same kind of legal or ethical issues as human sex workers do,” Danaher told Future of Sex.
People wouldn't need to fear criminal punishment for having sex with a robot, whereas human prostitution is illegal in many places around the world.
Issues of exploitation and trafficking could also be avoided, Danaher said. That's granted the degree of artificial intelligence in robots doesn't become sophisticated enough to give them artificial “personhood.”
If sex robots are properly cleaned after each use, there could be a lower risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease or infection.
Robots specifically designed for sex could also be superior lovers than a flesh and blood human. Perhaps they'd be better suited to catering to a client's whims and fetishes.
Still, another important thought to consider, according to Danaher, is what drives people to desire sex with human prostitutes in the first place. These factors would need to carry over to robots for them to be the top pick.
For example, research shows some people who buy sex still want the same personal connection linked to sexual relationships. Some sex workers will act out this fantasy.
Though for robots, Danaher's not so sure the right technology will arrive anytime soon.
Why Human Sex Workers May Be the Future
“There is some tantalizing evidence to suggest that people do develop kinds of attachment (to robots), but I don't think it's anywhere near the kinds of reciprocal interaction that you would get with humans,” Danaher said.
They point to the work of Julie Carpenter, a research fellow at California Polytechnic State University who specializes in human and robot relationships. They interviewed 23 U.S. soldiers whose bomb disposal robots had been blown up.
After learning their mechanical helpers had been destroyed, some cried and even held funerals.
Danaher doesn't rule out the possibility of people forming humanlike bonds with machines. However, they think this connection is closer to the affection held for a beloved pet.
And even if technology improves to such a degree that humanoids and people are nearly identical, they add that it's possible simply knowing an object isn't human is enough to garner distaste for it.
Yet, Danaher admits their belief people will prefer human sex may be shortsighted.
“One of the potential problems with my paper is that I'm comparing robotic sex to human sex, and I'm saying robotic sex will succeed or fail depending on how close a facsimile or replication of human sex it is,” they said.
“But at least among some futurists and transhumanists, they are enamored with the idea of something that transcends human sexuality, that is even better and an even more intense experience.”
Do you think robots will take over prostitution?

The Abbey likely won't open until February, its owner said Wednesday. View Full Caption Flickr
IRVING PARK — Almost a month after a fire wreaked serious damage on The Abbey, the owner of the pub and music venue is saying it may not be ready to reopen until early next year.
At the time of the fire, which firefighters extinguished soon after it broke out near the back door of the popular spot on Nov. 17, owner Patrick Looney said they were hoping to reopen the business at 3420 W. Grace Ave. within a matter of days.
More than three weeks later, Looney said he's still negotiating with insurance companies and has yet to make any major repairs.
"It's a more involved process than we thought, and there's more damage than we thought," Looney told DNAinfo on Wednesday. "If I had to guess, I'd say we'll have to be closed until at least February."
The fire itself caused only minor damage near the venue's stage, Looney said, but smoke and water blasted by firefighters left the floor, roof and windows in need of serious fixes.
Looney said they and their father, who co-own the pub, are eager to nail down an official reopening date but underestimated the administrative hurdles on the way to getting there.
"A lot has to be coordinated with the city, and the property owners are responsible for some of the repairs, so we're really at the mercy of their schedules," Looney said. "It's frustrating for sure, but we'll get it done."
A silver lining to emerge from the damage, they added, would be the opportunity to replace and "upgrade" some of the bar's facilities, including its speaker system, bathrooms and furniture.
"The real negative right now, though, is all our employees who are out of work," Looney said. "That's what's really putting pressure on us to get this done."
The Abbey employs 20 people full-time and part-time, Looney said.
In the weeks after the fire, previously scheduled concerts were moved to other North Side venues, like Township and Beat Kitchen. The Abbey's next scheduled concert isn't until Feb. 26, according to its website.
"We've had to cancel our shows for the rest of the year, and probably through January, too," Looney said. "Hopefully we won't have to go much further than that."

CHICAGO — Firefighters pulled two people out of the rubble of a Washington Park apartment building that completely collapsed after an explosion Sunday night.
At least two people were hurt when the building in the 5800 block of South Calumet Avenue collapsed about 7 p.m., said Larry Langford, a Chicago Fire Department spokesperson.
One person was rescued in the rubble about 7:20 p.m., and a second person was pulled out about 7:45, fire officials said. The first victim was taken to University of Chicago Hospital in serious condition.
Chicago Fire scanners just after the building collapsed:
Officials "don't know what caused the building to explode, but it did," Langford said, calling it a "violent collapse."
Crews are working to determine if there are more victims, they said.

The question of whether to have a debate on when human life begins will face the House of Commons again Friday as Conservative MP Stephen Woodworth's private member's motion returns for its second hour of debate.
Woodworth is calling on MPs to hold a special committee to look at when human life begins. The definition in the Criminal Code says human life begins when a child has fully emerged from the mother's birth canal. Woodworth says that's based on a 400-year-old definition imported from Britain and should be updated.
The MP, who represents Kitchener Centre, Ont., says they don't expect to have enough support for their motion to pass.
"Although we have a majority in the House, I don't expect to have majority support for [motion] 312 at this point," they said of the Conservative caucus.
But supporters of their motion are phoning and e-mailing their MPs, they said.
"Perhaps that will have a beneficial effect."
The vote on the motion will be next Wednesday.
No immediate effect on abortion
Woodworth says they wanted to clear up some of the criticism he's heard about their motion, referred to as 312. First, it wouldn't change any law, they said.

"So will abortion become illegal if motion 312 passes? No. The only result of motion 312 will be that Parliament and all Canadians will be better informed," they said.
But better information could mean people change their minds on abortion, they added.
Some of the opposition, Woodworth believes, is from those who believe abortion should be an option.
"There really are people who believe that the only way to justify abortion is to pretend that a child is not a human being until the moment of complete birth. And so they wish to preserve that pretence," they said.
While Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Canadians don't want to re-open the debate on abortion, Woodworth says it's okay to have policy disagreements with colleagues.
"I think it would be an immature view of politics to think, because you like and admire someone, you ought never to disagree with them," they said.

Image caption The Girobank offered banking at post offices for decades
The Post Office is to offer current accounts in the UK, following a regulator's claim that the market offers little choice for consumers.
The new account, provided by Bank of Ireland, will be available in some areas in the coming weeks before a wider launch next year.
Few details have been released about the characteristics of the current account at this stage.
In January, a regulator said the market was dominated by a few providers.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said that Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and HSBC held 75% of the market.
This led to a "lack of dynamism" from the banks, it said, together with a lack of choice for customers, meaning they were unlikely to switch to a different bank.
The Post Office, which has 11,500 branches, already offers a range of financial products in a link with Bank of Ireland.
Some three million Post Office customers already use products such as savings accounts, mortgages and insurance policies.
Customers of nearly all the major UK banks are able to use post office counters for some services, including depositing or withdrawing money from their non-Post Office accounts.
It will be interesting to see whether this account will be as transparent and simple in structure as they suggest Rachel Springall, Moneyfacts Bank customers 'lacking choice'
However, Santander customers, with the exception of its business customers and its Alliance and Leicester brand, are unable to do so at all.
High Street presence
The Post Office has not released details of the account yet. For example, it has not said how much interest would be paid, or whether there would be a charge for a packaged account.
"We have carried out extensive research into the current account market and the findings tell us that customers want simplicity, transparency and good value for money," said Nick Kennett, director of financial services at the Post Office.
Rachel Springall, spokesperson for financial information service Moneyfacts, said that the new Post Office account could help to boost competition, depending on how it was set up and what rewards it would offer customers.
"The Post Office has a good High Street presence, perfect for people who prefer the more personal branch banking. It will be interesting to see whether this account will be as transparent and simple in structure as they suggest," they said.
Image caption The Post Office already offers savings accounts provided by Bank of Ireland
Kevin Mountford, head of banking at comparison website Moneysupermarket, said: "Until now most of these challenger accounts have been aimed at specific audiences.
"The Post Office current account should have mass market appeal due to its large customer base and ease of access, so I expect this account will be very popular."
Girobank
Other new entrants to the UK current account market in recent times include Metro Bank in 2010 and M&S Bank in 2012. Tesco Bank has also announced plans to launch an account soon.
However, the OFT review of the £9bn market said that the newcomers were yet to be in a position to provide a "significant challenge" to the established providers.
Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: "More competition is desperately needed to force banks to genuinely compete for customers. But switching banks must also be made much easier and people will need to see real benefits from new providers to encourage them to move."
This is not the first time that a current account has been available at post offices. The Girobank was set up by the General Post Office in 1968 and was the first to offer free accounts to individual customers.
It was taken over by Alliance and Leicester in 1990 and its name was dropped in 2003.
Five-star DE Marlon Davidson commits to Auburn

AUBURN — According to the Twitter account of Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn, a big “BOOM” was heard from the Greenville, Ala., area Friday afternoon.
Greenville High School defensive end Marlon Davidson, a five-star prospect, verbally committed to Auburn Friday afternoon at a media conference at their high school. Davidson chose the Tigers over Alabama, Florida State, Georgia, LSU and Michigan.
The 6-foot-4, 260-pounder is now the highest ranked committed prospect on Auburn's projected 2016 recruiting class, which now ranks No. 16 according to 247Sports.com. Davidson is the third defensive lineman to verbally commit to Auburn, joining three-star recruits Tashawn Manning and Daquan Newkirk.
After Davidson's commitment, Malzahn sent out a message on Twitter that said the following: “Boom!!!!! War Eagle!!!”
Davidson is rated the 24th player in the country according to 247sports.com and the second best defensive lineman.
"It's so much tradition, so much family," Davidson said after making their announcement.
Davidson continues Auburn streak of having five-star commitments from each of the last five years of recruiting classes: Carl Lawson and Montravius Adams (2013), Roc Thomas and Tre' Williams (2014) and Byron Cowart (2015).
Davidson, who has also played locally at Carver High School in Montgomery, is the brother of former Auburn defensive lineman Ken Carter. Carter is now on the Auburn football staff in the player development department after being a part of two Auburn teams that competed in the national championship game.
"He's very athletic for their size," Carver head coach Billy Gresham said. "He's 6-4, 270, but they move like a linebacker. They move very well. He's very agile. The one thing they do is they play with a low center of gravity. Plays with a lot of leverage all the time and that's what really allows them to beat blockers. They play hard every single play. They don't ever take any plays off and that's very rare for a guy their size."
Davidson told 247Sports.com that their commitment to Auburn was proceeded by the relationship that was built between them and two members of the Tigers staff – defensive line coach Rodney Garner and defensive coordinator Will Muschamp.
“(Muschamp) told me I'd fit in right away,” Davidson said to 247Sports.com. “He said I'd come in and play and get my groove on, and just go ahead and finish everything and just go on and be a first-year student All-American and do everything that I want to do.”
Davidson did say they would take official visits to Alabama, Georgia, LSU and Florida State, which leaves it open if he'll change where they eventually sign with in February.
"I hope they do (recruit me) because of the fact that it's not over," Davidson said. "It's not the end of my decision. It's just the beginning. The only thing they've got to do is recruit me. I want to be recruited."
Davidson said they plan on graduating from high school early and being an early enrollee in order to be ready for spring practices.

For physicians, the dream of 3D printing is to one day be able to print functional tissues and organs for patients, made from their own cells. Doing this will allow a level of bespoke geometric customization and biochemical matching that will dramatically improve the quality of life of tens of thousands of people in need.
We have yet to reach that lofty goal but a new project carried out by researchers at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine takes the dream one step closer to reality.
In a paper published in the journal Biomaterials Science, the researchers demonstrate a method of generating implantable tissues with functioning capillaries, the tiny blood vessels responsible for supplying the body with oxygen and other nutrients.
The demonstration involved using a combination of human endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells to initiate a process called tubulogenesis, that is a key element of the formation of said blood-transporting vessels.
“Here we are investigating tiny volumes of multicellular tissue, smaller than a raindrop,” Rice bioengineer Jordan Miller told Digital Trends. “But big things happen there. Endothelial cells are the cells lining all our blood vessels and they create our tiniest vessels: Capillaries. We studied these endothelial cells in natural and semi-synthetic materials that are compatible with 3D printing. We are optimizing the materials and cell formulations to get robust formation of tubules made entirely from the cells themselves.”
Miller says that 3D bioprinting has advanced dramatically over the past decade. However, there is still a big tradeoff that is difficult to avoid: An increase in 3D-printing resolution necessarily means a decrease in the total build volume. (Think of it like drawing a picture, where you can choose between spending your time adding detail to a small area, or sketching out a much larger image.)
“A 3D printer with a 1-micrometer resolution only has a cubic millimeter build volume, [which is] not big enough for much functional utility,” they continued. “So instead, we aim for 3D printers with about 50- to 200-micrometer resolution, and we want to work with these endothelial cells to make tiny capillaries that could eventually connect to larger vessels that we can readily 3D print. In that way, we would retain the build volume but still be able to develop nutrients to the smallest cell volumes. These findings will help cell biologist and bioengineers continue to make progress toward customized replacement organs.”
At present, Miller said the researchers are working to integrate their findings with this work into their existing work with 3D bioprinting. “Identifying materials formulations that work for 3D printing and that can simultaneously support robust capillary formation is the key to generating living tissues with multiscale vasculature spanning millimeters to microns,” they said.
Come to Singularity Hub for the latest from the frontiers of finance and technology as we bring you coverage of Singularity University and CNBC's Exponential Finance Summit.
It's not every day that someone goes on a morning TV show and talks about the technological disruption of Fortune 500 companies and their subsequent failing as a sign of good things to come. But that's exactly what went down on CNBC's pre-market show Squawk Box today as Peter Diamandis delivered the sobering message.
Somewhat surprisingly, the conversation was generally upbeat considering the scope that was being discussed in under 10 minutes. Comments about how banks will go away and inevitably change seemed to just skate by. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: things are going to get better, according to Diamandis, even if there are short term pains (like taxi drivers in the wake of Uber's growth).
Some interesting highlights:
When co-host Andrew Sorkin questioned whether these technological changes will bring the same benefits to both developing and developed countries, Diamandis said, “What I see is our cost of living substantially reducing,” citing how technological advances in healthcare, education, and transportation, as examples, will reduce costs for consumers. They added, “A lot of the things we spend our money on will be demonetized.”
With disruption comes instability and government regulation aims to protect industries, but these efforts can thwart progress. Addressing regulation as a dampener to growth, Diamandis point out that people still want change: “The government's job is stability…People like waking up in the morning and knowing, ‘The world's the same as when I went to sleep the night before.' But we do like change if it's 10 times better.”
Referring to the 8 predictions for the year 2025 that Diamandis wrote about recently, co-host Joe Kernen addressed the rapid growth of computational power. They asked Diamandis if they agreed with Ray Kurzweil's estimate that the Singularity—the period of time that technological change will be so extreme that we can't even imagine what things will be like—will come around 2045. Of course, Diamandis who has written extensively about Kurzweil's work as a co-author of both Abundance and Bold, agreed.”[Humans are] co-evolving with the technology we're creating” and that we always have, they said.

Is the modern Sherlock Holmes as big a hero as the classic James Bond? Steven Moffat, co-creator of the hit BBC1 reboot, has suggested they might be – and that Benedict Cumberbatch is a “star” rather than merely a skilled actor.

”The difference between stars and just great actors is that stars can make parts into them, rather than themselves into parts; they make those people them,” Moffat told the Sydney Morning Herald, ahead of the Australian premiere of Sherlock series two. ”They never quite play it like you expect them to, so it becomes very much Benedict's Sherlock. Look at how Sean Connery owned James Bond.”
The interview also saw Moffat recall how writing duties were divvied up for the show's three-episode 2012 run – they and co-creator Mark Gatiss spent a lot of time agonising over who would bring The Hound of the Baskervilles up to date, Moffat said.
”Obviously we were both eyeing Baskervilles – that's the one, isn't it? Suddenly, we were in a place where neither of us was writing it and we were thinking of farming it out. I kept looking at Mark and every time they talked about Baskervilles their eyes lit up, so I thought they should be the one to write that,” Moffat remembered.
”I think they were right for that one, in the same way that I was right for [A Scandal in Belgravia], which has a twisted love story,” Moffat went on.
”I've written quite a lot of tormented relationships in my time and liked it. I like doing the non-love story… it felt like something I was inspired to do.”

Anyway, back to Benedict Cumberbond, as we now call them in the office. Just for fun…
With the impending return of Theo Walcott from long term injury, Arsene Wenger will soon find themselves with a number of decisions to make regarding selection in the Arsenal lineup. For the majority of the Premiership season thus far, the Arsenal front four has basically picked itself, not because of it's great form, but because injuries have so depleted the options that Wenger had very little choice.
Until a few weeks ago, a front four of Danny Welbeck at striker, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Alexis Sanchez, and Santi Cazorla forming the three attacking midfielders behind the striker, was commonplace. Injuries to Olivier Giroud, Mesut Ozil, and Theo Walcott gave the manager little choice, especially when it has come to the center forward and wingers. Now though, with Giroud fit and seemingly in form, and Walcott nearing their return after a setback, choices must be made.
With Ozil still out at least a few more weeks, Cazorla seems the obvious choice to continue in the playmaker role beneath the striker. While Alexis has played there at times with success, Cazorla has been in good form in that role. Arsenal have shown the flexibility to rotate positions among the front three, meaning whether Wenger continues to prefer Cazorla in the middle or chooses to put Sanchez there from time to time, both can be expected to feature as frequently as possible.
Two other questions arise when it comes to how Arsenal will line up going forward. The return of Olivier Giroud to health and form has seen Welbeck pushed to the wing or a substitute's role. One of the reasons Welbeck was unsettled at United was that they rarely featured in the center striker role, appearing far more often off the bench or on the wings. However, while starting from a wide position at Manchester United left Welbeck feeling marginalized and unhappy, at Arsenal they're settling in nicely on the wings.
Consider the two images below. The first is Welbeck's heatmap for United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City last March.
In this case, Welbeck began the game as the left winger in a front three. Notice how nearly all of their touches come on the left side of the pitch, and how few of them there are. At United, Welbeck was regularly shunted to the wings like this, and was far from a focal point of the attack.
Next consider the following image of Welbeck's heatmap in Arsenal's 1-0 victory over West Brom this fall.
They again line up on the left side as an attacking midfielder/winger, but notice how much more freedom they have in the Arsenal attack to move around the pitch. In fact, Cazorla, Alexis and Welbeck, the three attacking midfielders in this case, regularly rotated sides of the field, creating space and opportunities for each other. The match winner, scored by Welbeck, is a perfect example of this. Cazorla comes wide left to pick up the ball, creating space for Welbeck to drift into the middle, perfectly placed to head home Cazorla's cross.
Welbeck has also shown since Giroud's return that they excel at pushing forward and even towards the middle to join Giroud at times almost as a second striker. This has paid dividends in recent games with Arsenal scoring more frequently off of crosses, in part due to the seemingly obvious benefit of having anther body in the area. Welbeck's willingness to push forward also creates that extra space in which Cazorla can operate, as Welbeck's match winner against West Brom showed. Welbeck has also shown no lack of effort on the defensive side, something that Arsenal has lacked at times previously, and desperately need out of their wingers if they're going to improve defensively as a team.
Another reason Welbeck excels on the wings at Arsenal is the style of play of Olivier Giroud. While Giroud often comes under criticism from Arsenal fans for many things they do, they undeniably excel at linking the Arsenal attack together, often with their back to goal. Giroud's ability to win possession and quickly and accurately play the ball on to a teammate moving towards the goal creates chance after chance for players like Welbeck and Alexis to cut in from the wings for quality chances on goal. Not only does Giroud's play create chances for themselves and others, it also keeps players like Welbeck and Theo Walcott, both of whom would prefer to start centrally, happy starting on the wings, due to the fluidity of the front three or four and the space to cut inside and play centrally at times.
In addition to helping keep wide players happy, Giroud's style as a striker seems to be a better fit for Arsenal's tactical setup than Welbeck does. While Welbeck often does well facing the defense and attacking them head on, Giroud, as mentioned, tends to play more often with their back to goal. While Welbeck's style puts pressure directly on the opposing defenders to stop him, it is less successful at bringing other players into the attack and tends to result in turnovers more frequently. Giroud meanwhile manages to hold the ball well, helping bring other players into the attack and help the team maintain possession as they go forward. While Welbeck is in many ways more dynamic as a striker than Giroud, Giroud manages to draw defenders towards them with their back to goal, allowing them to play midfielders or wide players into open space and creating chances.
Keeping players happy on the pitch is one thing. Keeping them happy off the pitch is an entirely different challenge. With Walcott back very soon, and Ozil in the not so distant future, Wenger may have a struggle on their hands to keep everyone happy. Given that it's Arsenal, and someone is bound to get hurt right when another player comes back, perhaps Wenger has nothing to worry about. That said, if Giroud, Welbeck, Ozil, Cazorla, Chamberlain and Walcott are all healthy at the same time it creates a battle for minutes. Competition is good, and a title-contending squad depends on strong depth, but keeping all these players happy will be a struggle, and that's ignoring players like Podolski, Campbell and Rosicky who can't seem to get minutes even now.
Given that Walcott is nearing a return from major injury, expect Wenger to be cautious in introducing them to the lineup, unless of course injuries force them into a starting role. Once fully fit Walcott should have to earn their spot in the team, usually on the right wing. That would push Alexis to the left wing and Welbeck to the bench. Luckily for Wenger, of their forward players, only Giroud is limited to a single role. All of Welbeck, Alexis, Chamberlain, Cazorla, Ozil, and Walcott can play multiple roles, giving Wenger great flexibility, should they choose to use it, in picking the ideal XI for each matchup. If everyone can stay health, Wenger may have a headache on their hands, but in filing problems into “good problems” and “bad problems,” this problem would definitely fit the former category.
Given the upcoming business in the fixture list, finding minutes for everybody many not even be a problem. With a decent draw in the Champions League, the busy holiday fixture list coming up and the FA Cup beginning in January, it seems that the Arsenal attack may be getting fit just in time. Should Arsenal progress in the Champions League and FA Cup there may even be enough minutes to satisfy them all. If Arsenal are going to have any success this season, they'll need all attackers healthy, and they'll need Wenger to balance their minutes to keep them all happy.

Concerned that their precious children are not learning to be terrified enough about the deadly consequences of sexual intercourse, lawmakers in Tennessee have added language to their abstinence-only sex ed curriculum that warns students of the dangers of "gateway sexual activity" in a desperate effort to make sure teenagers are not "gateway enjoying themselves." This raises some important questions. If non-coital sexual activities are gateways to coitus like how marijuana is allegedly a gateway to crack, then is dry humping the ganja of sex?
The amended sex ed — excuse me, "family life education," because S-E-X is a dirty word that we never say — sailed through the Tennessee state senate like a lubed up schooner down a giant Slip n' Slide, with only one Senator voting against it. The old version of Tennessee's abstinence only education curriculum allowed teachers to suggest non-sex romantic activities to their horned up students. For example, children, have you considered frottage? How about heavy petting? Over-the-clothes second base is an underrated but effective way to experience boob without endangering the fate of your eternal soul. Try making out and neck-kissing!

But lawmakers worry that encouraging anything that might lead to sex is basically giving students a free pass to have orgies during study hall, hence the new, Super Abstinence Only Education curriculum that expressly prohibits "Promot(ing) any gateway sexual activity or health message that encourages students to experiment with non-coital sexual activity." Republican Sen. Jack Johnson explained, "‘Abstinence' means from all of these activities, and we want to promote that. What we do want to communicate to the kids is that the best choice is abstinence."
So what, exactly, does the law consider a "gateway" sexual activity? Blow jobs are obviously out, even though no one's ever gotten pregnant from one. And cuddling should be discouraged, since cuddling often leads to spooning and spooning to sin. But what about hand holding? Hand holding can introduce students to the feeling of having their skin touch another person's skin, which should not be allowed outside of the church-sanctioned boundaries of marriage. And eye contact can lead to talking, which can lead to crushing, which can lead directly to pregnancy. Maybe family life education teachers in the state of Tennessee are better off if they straight up refrain from mentioning any sort of activity that any two people can engage in, ever, and spend the duration of every class period seated silently in the front of the room while students sit with their eyes closed and hands folded chastely in their laps, listening to a recording of bagpipe music interspersed with the voice of Gilbert Gottfried saying "DON'T HAVE SEX! DON'T HAVE SEX!" in order to discourage sexual thoughts, which are also gateways.
Considering the fact that abstinence-only sex education does not work, the fact that lawmakers are doubling down on a terrible idea really demonstrates a unique commitment to failure and denial of reality. Kudos, Tennessee. I see the Volunteer State has Volunteered to see an uptick in teen pregnancy in the upcoming years.

TN Senate approves bill that prohibits promoting 'gateway sexual activity' [The Tennesseean]
The NHL's department of player safety was busy extending the long arm of the law once again on Monday, handing out yet another suspension for an illegal hit. This time it's Edmonton Oilers defenseman Corey Potter feeling its wrath, as the league announced on Monday evening that they have been suspended two games for boarding Anaheim Ducks forward Nick Bonino on Sunday night.
The incident occurred early in the second period of Edmonton's 3-2 loss. Potter received a five-minute major and a game misconduct for the hit. As a result of the suspension they will lose $7,948.72 in salary.
Here is the NHL's explanation of the play.
Potter has appeared in nine games for the Oilers this season and recorded three assists while averaging nearly 14 minutes of ice-time per game.

Image caption The i was launched in 2010 with a cover price of 20p
Johnston Press has confirmed it has reached a deal to buy the i newspaper from ESI Media for £24m.
Johnston, which owns The Scotsman and more than 200 other titles, said the purchase was subject to shareholder approval.
It will pay £22m in cash once the deal is completed and the rest on 20 April.
The announcement came as ESI confirmed that the i's sister titles, The Independent and Independent on Sunday, will halt print editions in March.
In a statement, Johnston said the i acquisition would create the UK's fourth-largest print publisher with more than 600,000 paid copies a day.
The i became Britain's first new daily national newspaper in nearly 25 years when it launched in 2010 with a cover price of 20p. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC), the newspaper sold nearly 270,000 copies daily in December.
'Transformational acquisition'
Johnston said its directors believed the i provided a "strong strategic fit" and would help build the group's national print and digital display advertising revenues.
The move is also expected to strengthen its existing portfolio, which includes The Scotsman, The Yorkshire Post and the Belfast-based Newsletter.
Johnston chief executive Ashley Highfield said: "This is a transformational acquisition for Johnston Press and an important step towards delivering our long-term strategy.
"i is a highly-regarded newspaper with a clear market position and a loyal readership.
"By joining with Johnston Press the combined circulation will be equal to 9% of national daily circulation, making us the fourth-largest player in the market.
"This enhanced reach represents a significant growth opportunity for Johnston Press in terms of national print and digital advertising revenue. It also rebalances our revenues towards less volatile circulation revenues.
"With our considerable digital experience the combination of Johnston Press and i will also allow us to grow digital audiences and revenues through the creation of inews.co.uk."
Johnston Press recently revealed plans to cut editorial jobs across its operations in the UK as part of a bid to reduce costs following a decline in revenue.
Shares in the publisher rose earlier this month after it said it expected a major reduction in its pension scheme deficit.
A team of scientists from city-based Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) has come out with discovery of a mycobacterial protein that promises to fight tuberculosis in a novel way. In the study, the team led by Sanjeev Khosla has used the knowledge of epigenetics to open a new frontier in the research on host-Mycobacterium tuberculosis interaction.
Epigenetic defines the process by which same DNA in different cells of an organism perform different functions. The team has identified a novel mycobacterial protein Rv1988, which is secreted out of the mycobacterium into the host upon infection and localises to the chromatin (DNA-histone complex) in the nucleus of the human cell.
“Around six years ago, the team started this research work and further observed that Rv1988 is a methyltransferase enzyme that methylates the histone H3 protein at an arginine amino acid. This methylation epigenetically modulates the transcription of genes, which would have otherwise mounted an immune response against the infecting pathogen,” CDFD Director G R Chandak told reporters in Hyderabad.
Identification of Rv1988 as an important mycobacterial virulence factor, augurs well not only for it to be a potential target for therapy against mycobacterial infections but also for developing a new biomarker for identification of M-tuberculosis infection in humans, they said. Rv1988 is important for the pathogen as its deletion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis reduced bacterial survival.
These observations have been confirmed by Rv1988 expression in a non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis that negatively affected the health of infected mice. This study has recently been published in the prestigious journal ‘Nature Communications', Khosla said. Since arginine amino acid at 42nd position in Rv1988 is normally not known to be methylated by human methyltransferases, methylation of this amino acid can be used as a sensitive marker of mycobacterial infection, they explained.
A patent based on using this novel atypical site of methylation in histone H3 for diagnosis of M-tuberculosis infection has also been filed by CDFD. “We have found a novel protein which is released by the Mycobacterium that tries to control the cell by going into the control centre of the cell which is the nucleus. The next step is to talk to the clinicians for various things and one is to actually see in the patients what happens. What we have seen in cells, does it happen in the patients also and what stage of TB it happens,” Khosla explained.
“We have to talk with doctors/chest physicians and take their opinion to understand clinical pictures. We will also talk to chemists and researchers if there can be a drug target. If this protein can be destroyed, the Mycobacterium cannot control the human cell and once it can't control, the immune system will function and kill the cell and that is what we are trying to do,” Khosla added.

In recent years we've come to expect mostly garbage coming from Germany. Usually when we talk about Deutschland it has to do with terrorism and rape (see GERMANY: New Police Report Shows MASSIVE Surges in Migrant Rapes…). Or censorship. As it turns out, Germans have another hidden facet of their society helping to launch them into record grossness. Apparently the number of women suffering genital mutilation has increased by thousands. I'm sure you can guess why…
Thousands of girls in Germany face genital mutilation on top of the tens of thousands of women who have already suffered it, a new government report claims. The study found that 48,000 women and girls living in Germany have been victims of female genital mutilation, an increase of 30 percent since 2014. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported estimates which claim that up to 9,000 adolescent women face having this illegal operation.
Say, this sounds a lot like something feminists would care about. It's rather uncharacteristic of them to refrain from any squawking in the name of women's rights…
Most of the women living in Germany who have suffered FGM originate from Eritrea, Somalia, Egypt, Ethiopia or Iraq. The number of women from these countries living in Germany increased by 40 percent between 2014 and 2016.
Clearly there's a connection between the uptick of Muslim migrants and mutilation. What with Islam's burning hatred of all things female and such. Female genital mutilation is an age old tradition in Muslim countries. You know, like kabobs. Since anti-women Muslims are settling down in Germany, and large parts of Europe, they've brought their culture and best snipping scissors with them.
The worst part of all this? As mentioned, we've seen zero protests in the streets over the atrocities Islam commits against women (read Dear Feminists: You'll Never be Relevant Until You Address Islam's Real Rape Culture). There were no pussy hats in the streets of Berlin. Not regular pink pussy hats, or pussy hats slashed with a knife. Possibly because western feminists are too busy rallying for other important female issues… Like free tampons.
People who actually care about women, more commonly known as not-feminists, have little tolerance for the sexism of Mohammad and co. The latest liberal decree du jour is that speaking out against Islam and its crimes against the female gender is “Islamophobic.” But remember, it's the “tolerant” left who cares about women. Just not these, because reasons…

In the National Football League (NFL), the highest official passer rating that a quarterback can achieve is 158.3, which is called a "perfect passer rating". To qualify, during a single game a quarterback must attempt at least 10 passes, have zero interceptions, have a minimum completion percentage of a 77.5%, have a minimum of 11.88% of their passes score touchdowns, and have a minimum of 12.5 yards per attempt. The passer rating was developed in 1971.[1][2]
Applying the formula to pre and post-1971 quarterbacks, as of November 2018 , there have been 60 different players, playing in 72 distinct games, who have achieved a perfect passer rating. Four of these games have occurred in the post-season. Seven quarterbacks have achieved the feat more than once: Ben Roethlisberger and Peyton Manning have four; Kurt Warner has three; and Craig Morton, Dave Krieg, Ken O'Brien, and Tom Brady have two.
Ben Roethlisberger is the only quarterback with multiple perfect ratings in a single regular season, when they achieved the feat twice in 2007. The San Francisco 49ers had two different quarterbacks achieve a perfect rating in the same season, with Steve Young (week 7) and Joe Montana (week 10) both earning perfect ratings. Peyton Manning had one perfect rating in the 2003 regular season and one in the post-season.
Drew Bledsoe, Robert Griffin III, and Marcus Mariota are the only quarterbacks to achieve a perfect passer rating in their rookie seasons, with Mariota being the only quarterback to post one in their NFL debut.
Five of these performances were in a losing cause, though Chad Pennington is the only quarterback to play from start to finish and earn both a loss and a perfect rating. Twelve quarterbacks have had a game where they earned a perfect 158.3 passer rating and also a game where they earned a 0.0 the lowest possible passer rating during their careers: Otto Graham, Johnny Unitas, Joe Namath, Terry Bradshaw, Len Dawson, Bob Griese, James Harris, Bob Lee, Craig Morton, Dan Fouts, Eli Manning, and Peyton Manning.
On 8 November 2018, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger became the most recent person to achieve a perfect passer rating.[3]
List [ edit ]
Statistics [ edit ]
Only three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating with 30 or more attempts. Ken O'Brien threw 26-for-32 in their perfect game for a completion rate of 81%, while Kurt Warner threw 24 of 30 in their perfect game for a completion rate of 80% and Jared Goff threw 26 of 33 in their perfect game for a completion rate of 78.8%. Ryan Tannehill holds the record for completion rate in a perfect game, throwing 18 of 19 for 94.7% in their 2015 perfect game. Chris Chandler has the best rate for a game with at least 20 pass attempts (23 of 26) for 88% completed in their 1995 perfect game.
Only Nick Foles has accomplished a perfect passer rating with seven touchdowns thrown. Two quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating with six touchdowns thrown: Peyton Manning was the first to achieve the record on September 28, 2003 against the New Orleans Saints, while Tom Brady matched the feat on October 21, 2007 against the Miami Dolphins. Thirteen quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect game with only two touchdowns thrown. It is impossible to achieve a perfect game with only one touchdown because of the 10 passing attempt minimum to qualify, combined with the minimum 11.875% touchdown-to-attempted-pass ratio.
Three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating with more than 400 passing yards. Ken O'Brien threw for 431 yards on November 2, 1986 against the Seattle Seahawks. Nick Foles threw for 406 yards on November 3, 2013 against the Oakland Raiders. Jared Goff threw for 465 yards on September 27, 2018 against the Minnesota Vikings. Only three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect game with fewer than 150 passing yards. Scott Hunter threw for 138 yards on October 31, 1976 against the New Orleans Saints, Drew Bledsoe threw for 143 yards on December 26, 1993 against the Indianapolis Colts, and Rich Gannon threw for 146 yards on October 15, 1992 against the Detroit Lions.
Only three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating in their rookie season. Drew Bledsoe of the New England Patriots achieved it against the Indianapolis Colts on December 26, 1993; Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins did it against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 18, 2012; and Marcus Mariota of the Tennessee Titans did it against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 13, 2015, the first quarterback to do so in their professional debut. Only one QB, Ben Roethlisberger, has accomplished a perfect passer rating twice in one season, against the Ravens on November 5, 2007; and against the St. Louis Rams on December 20, 2007.[76]. Peyton Manning had one perfect rating in the 2003 regular season and one in the post-season.

PESCADERO, Calif. – Authorities in San Mateo County believe a mountain lion entered a home in the coastal town of Pescadero and took a resident's dog, CBS San Francisco reports.
Deputies said a woman, child and a 15-pound Portugese Podengo were sleeping in a bedroom at a home on the 800 block of Native Sons Road early Monday morning when the incident occurred.
The incident happened in the hills just above Pescadero, a remote area where mountain lion sightings have become more common.
The bedroom had French doors leading to the outside partially open to let in fresh air.
The door was only slightly ajar, but it was enough to let a mountain lion slip in and take away a beloved pet right next to a sleeping child.
Around 3 a.m., the woman said they woke up after the dog began to bark aggressively. The woman said they then saw the shadow of an animal enter the room and take the dog from the bed.
“As soon as I saw it walk out, I said, ‘That's a lion,'” said homeowner Victoria Fought.
Lenora was a rescue dog and hasn't been seen since. Blood stains on the door step are the only signs left behind by the intruder.
Fought and their daughter Catalina Pesso still have a hard time believing a mountain lion could be so bold.
“It was shocking,” said Fought.
“I heard my little dog bark and it wasn't a bark that I've heard them do before,” said Pesso.
After calling 911, deputies searched the area and found paw prints similar to a mountain lion.
Game Warden Michael Harris was also called in to investigate. They examined what appeared to be mountain lion tracks that were spotted just down the lane.
“I took a couple of tails up closer to the house, and then some down here,” said Harris. “But I didn't find them down there either.”
Without the carcass of the dog, it will be hard to track down the lion and the warden are not planning to set traps.
Neighbors are being warned to be especially wary of mountain lions in this area, as this one showed they will go just about anywhere to find its prey.
Authorities have contacted the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to see if a follow-up investigation is necessary.
The Department of Energy still has 98.8 percent of its stimulus cash sitting in the bank.
Only $451 million of the $36.7 billion the DOE received when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was signed into law in February has been accounted for as "spent." It's a stunning number, but it's likely more money has already been spent, even if it hasn't made it onto the agency's books yet.
It just takes a while for the money spent on new jobs or projects to be recorded, said Matt Rogers, a senior advisor to Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, and the department's Recovery Act czar.
"We have moved $9.8 billion out the door," Rogers told Wired.com. "I think we're right on track with where we expected to be."
The DOE has only awarded $10 billion to companies, which works out to a little over a quarter of its total stimulus cash. That doesn't compare favorably with the average agency. Thirty-five percent of the total sum of money that all federal agencies received has already been spent. But perhaps we should expect the DOE to take a little more time reviewing applications.
The DOE spending situation is paralleled at the other science-based agencies like the National Science Foundation, NASA, and Environmental Protection Agency. Together, those agencies have only registered 1.2 percent of their $44 billion in Recovery Act money spent.
Rogers argued the DOE's pace and process were most advantageous for taxpayers, though. They referenced the competitive applications that were submitted by companies in hopes of grabbing $2.4 billion for advanced batteries. More than 2,000 peer reviewers are helping vet applications for the DOE.
"We awarded one out of every five projects, so the projects we were able to select are terrific projects," Rogers said. "If we don't go through this competitive process, you don't see the best projects. There's a time-quality trade-off."
The agency expects to award $16 billion by the end of September and $30 billion by the end of 2009, Rogers said. An additional $4 billion in loan guarantees might not show up in the books for months, but that money is headed into the field, too. If they hit their targets, more than 90 percent of the cash that Congress gave the DOE will be out of the agency's hands, even if it technically remains in the bank.
"We have a lag between obligation and costing," Rogers said. "I've been less focused on the costing column because I don't think it is illustrative of the hiring and impact in the marketplace. I'm going to be more worried about that if we don't see it moving by the end of the year."
Departments like Labor, Agriculture, and Commerce used their cash for projects that didn't require a competitive grant application process. Thus, the Department of Labor has spent nearly 68 percent of its $24.7 billion allotment and the Department of Health and Human Services 65 percent of its $42.3 billion.
Curt Rich, head of public policy practice at Van Ness Feldman, said the DOE had an uphill battle getting the funds out quickly. They noted that the main internal beneficiary of the DOE, the office for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy had never seen this kind of money. And it all came flowing in under a new administration and DOE chief.
"While folks were waiting for solicitations to come out, there was some grousing," Rich said. "I think in hindsight, what they've been able to get done in six months is very impressive."
One would-be DOE stimulus money recipient, Oakland solar thermal company, Brightsource, gave the process high marks, too, even if it was taking a while.
"My opinion is that the DOE is doing a really good job in balancing the need for immediate stimulus while protecting the taxpayers' interest," said Keely Wachs, a spokesperson for the company, which has been negotiating a loan guarantee deal with the agency for months. "When I put only my Brightsource hat on, I think, 'Let's get it done.' But as a taxpayer, I want to make sure that those funds are being used appropriately."
Many in the clean tech industry, which will receive the lion's share of the funds, expect the DOE to ramp up pay-outs to companies over the next few weeks.
"We've got very high assurances that the floodgates are about to open in early September," said Dallas Kachan, managing director of the Cleantech Group.
Rogers said to expect major announcements out of the DOE every couple of weeks. For example, the grant winners receiving some of the $4.5 billion allocated to smart grid equipment will be announced soon.
"We'll see the big, investment-focused pieces now," Rogers said. "That's going to be the primary story as we work through the fall."

“By signing this resolution, I pledge my support to marriage equality for same-sex couples, consistent with equal protection under the law provided under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution,” the mayor said.
Wan told the GA Voice in by phone that the mayor called them out of a work session of the Public Safety Committee about 2:45 p.m. today.
“I was nervous. I wasn't sure what they wanted. I knew it had to be about the resolution, but I didn't know what they were going to say,” Wan said.
When Wan walked into the mayor's office, Reed's entire leadership team was with them and the mayor told them that they were signing the resolution and also coming out in support of marriage equality.
“I had no idea” this was going to happen, Wan said. “But for them to sign it and to come up with a position statement — I kept thanking him.
“I get it. Everyone has to go through their own process. All that matters to me is you reach the right decision,” Wan added.
Wan was there as Reed signed the resolution and the mayor then gave them the pen they signed the resolution with.
“I'm very proud of our city,” Wan said. “Over the last eight days, the council came out with a strong position and for the mayor to do that — that's as strong a message a city can send.”
Neither the City Council resolution nor the mayor's signature grants any new legal rights to same-sex couples in Atlanta, but LGBT activists argue it sends a powerful message in support of equality.
“I think it's a wonderful Christmas present. He's given this serious thought and he's come to the conclusuion that it's the right thing. They can't miss what's happening across the country with regard to marriage. They just needed time to dliberate and think about this from a personal perspective,” said longtime gay politico and former State House candidate Ken Britt, one of several LGBT activists who met with Reed in June 2012 to discuss the issue.
The meeting was asked for after President Barack Obama stated publicly in May that they supported marriage equality. Reed responded with a statement that they were still “wrestling” with the issue.
“While I am still wrestling with my own personal beliefs on the issue of marriage, I deeply appreciate the contributions gays and lesbians make to our city every single day and I remain committed to Atlanta's vibrant and diverse LGBT community,” Reed said at the time.
Charlie Stadtlander was also among the group of local LGBT activists that met with Reed over the summer. Stadtlander said today by phone that they hoped Reed would use their office to promote marriage equality on a national level.
“I think that Mayor Reed's endorsement is beneficial as a lobbying position on a national level. I believe that they will use their position to really push nationally in whatever way they can to make sure we're victorious on this issue,” Stadtlander said.
Stadtlander created a Facebook campaign that called on Reed to support marriage equality. They also created a petition on the website Change.org that received more than 5,000 signatures.
Reed is up for reelection in 2013. Their refusal to back marriage equality has dogged them since the 2009 mayoral race. Reed supported LGBT civil rights as a member of the state House and Senate, including sponsoring a hate crime bill that was later struck down as too vague.
But Reed's refusal to support gay marriage was enough to drive many gay and lesbian voters to support their two chief opponents in the mayoral race, City Council President Lisa Borders and City Councilmember Mary Norwood. Georgia Equality endorsed Borders in the general election, then declined to issue an endorsement in the runoff election between Reed and Norwood.
Still, many prominent gay leaders backed Norwood, and in a 2010 interview with GA Voice, Reed acknowledged that while they won the election by the slimmest of margins, they lost District 6 – home to Atlanta's highest concentration of gay voters – by a landslide.
“Despite having a record that I think was overwhelmingly stronger than any other individual in the race, and having a record that is stronger than any sitting elected official in the state,” Reed said then.
Reed faced renewed pressure to support marriage equality in May of this year, after President Barack Obama announced their personal support for the issue. The meeting with LGBT activists followed, along with an editorial from GA Voice urging Reed to speak out.
The June 27 meeting was attended by Stadtlander, Britt; attorney Lawrie Demorest of Alston & Bird; Pastor Dennis Meredith of Tabernacle Baptist Church; and attorney Doug Brooks, who is married and has children.
Creative Loafing also recently called on Reed to speak out in favor of marriage equality.
The full press release:
Mayor Kasim Reed Announces Support for Marriage Equality Mayor Reed signs Atlanta City Council resolution sponsored by Councilman Alex Wan and adopted on Dec. 3, 2012 ATLANTA – Mayor Kasim Reed today announced their support for marriage equality by signing a resolution sponsored by Councilman Alex Wan and passed by the City Council on Dec. 3, 2012. The resolution supports the city's lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual community by endorsing marriage equality for same-sex couples. “Today marks an important day as I announce my support for marriage equality,” said Mayor Reed. “It is well known that I have gone through a good bit of reflection on this issue, but listening to the stories of so many people that I know and care about has strengthened my belief that marriage is a fundamental right for everyone. Loving couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have the right to marry whomever they want. By signing this resolution, I pledge my support to marriage equality for same-sex couples, consistent with equal protection under the law provided under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.” Today's announcement follows years of Mayor Reed's advocacy for equal rights for gays and lesbians. During their term in the Georgia House of Representatives, Mayor Reed sponsored the only hate crimes bill ever to pass the General Assembly and defended the LGBT community's right to adopt children. As a co-sponsor for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, Mayor Reed proposed a measure that would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity by civilian and nonreligious employers. In 2004, Mayor Reed also voted against the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in Georgia. “I've always had the utmost respect for the Mayor. They have been a good friend to my wife De Linda and me and to our community,” said Lee Schreter, a friend of Mayor Reed's for more than 14 years and a shareholder with the law firm of Littler and Mendelson. “I believe they will be on the right side of history with this decision. I think people have underestimated how important it is to stand up and have your relationship recognized as a true marriage, but those attitudes are changing. I've always known that Kasim Reed wants people to be treated fairly and this is evidence of that.” The resolution approved by the Council and signed by Mayor Reed cites Atlanta's support of policies that protect equal rights for all citizens, as well as the city's numerous provisions that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by businesses, stores, hotels, restaurants and other public accommodations, and in housing sales and rentals. The City Code also prohibits sexual orientation discrimination in the city's employment decisions, and the city offers its employees the ability to enroll a domestic partner for health insurance coverage and to name a domestic partner as a pension beneficiary. “This is a reflection of the respect and concern for me and my husband Mike that Mayor Reed has shown through all the years of our advocating with them and to him,” said the Rev. Harry Knox, President and CEO of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. “I have always felt that Mayor Reed both respected my marriage and cared for Mike and me as people. The action they are taking today really reflects that and it feels like a ‘fullness of time' moment for me.” The City of Atlanta has one of the highest LGBT populations in the country based on U.S. Census and other data. The Rev. Timothy McDonald of First Iconium Baptist Church said he's encouraged by Mayor Reed's decision. “I'm grateful for Mayor Reed's positive, inclusive position on marriage equality,” said the Rev. McDonald. “It is consistent with the NAACP's position and I'm sure many in the city will celebrate this decision.” Mayor Reed also announced that they will join other leading mayors who have already signed the ‘Mayors for Freedom to Marry' pledge. Mayors for the Freedom to Marry is a broad-based and nonpartisan group of mayors who believe that all people should be able to share in the love and commitment of marriage. ”Mayor Reed, like the more than 200 other Mayors for the Freedom to Marry, has their eye on the economic growth, prosperity, diversity, and opportunity that the families they serve cherish — and knows that including same-sex couples and their contributions in the community and in marriage strengthens the city and our country,” said Evan Wolfson, founder and president of Freedom to Marry. “As we build toward more wins in 2013, we welcome Mayor Reed's support at this crucial time in the freedom to marry movement, and are excited to work with them to make the case for the freedom to marry both in Atlanta and across America.” Mayor Reed added: “I believe in tolerance and acceptance, regardless of a person's race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. That creed has been a guiding force for me throughout my life, as reflected by my actions and votes as a lifelong Democrat and elected official in the state of Georgia for more than 14 years.”

Microsoft today announced that it is partnering with a consortium of telecom companies to build a new transpacific undersea cable that will connect a number of points in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan with the U.S. West Coast (or beautiful Hillsboro, OR — the home of the Hillsboro Hops — to be precise). Microsoft says the New Cross Pacific (NCP) Cable Network will provide faster connections for its customers and help it compete on cloud cost.
In addition, Microsoft also today announced deals with Hibernia to offer faster connectivity between Canada, Ireland and the U.K., and AcquaComms to use its upcoming AEConnect cable between Shirley, NY and the West Coast of Ireland (with backhaul connections to the U.K.).
The Hibernia Express cable, the first new transatlantic cable in twelve years, will launch in September. It's partly optimized for very low-latency operations (the promise is under 60 milliseconds between New York and London) and will be able to handle up to 10 Tbps per cable pair once it is fully operational.
Microsoft is the first customer for the AEConnect cable, which will cost about $300 million to build. The cable uses 130 wavelengths x 100 Gbps per fibre pair and will also function as a platform for Microsoft's network expansion in Europe going forward.
For these two cables, Microsoft specifically notes that its investment is meant to connect its data center infrastructure in North America to Ireland and the U.K. “These cables will help deliver data at higher speeds, with higher capacity and lower latency for our customers across the globe,” Microsoft managing director for network enablement David Crowley writes today.
“As people and organizations expect data and information at their fingertips Microsoft must have an infrastructure that can deliver the cloud services, including Azure, which our customers need to support their global businesses,” Crowley says in today's announcement.
Without providing any additional details, Crowley also noted that Microsoft has been “significantly investing in subsea and terrestrial dark fiber capacity by engaging in fiber partnerships that span multiple oceans and continents” over the last nine months.
Microsoft isn't alone in its interest in expanding its global networking infrastructure. Its competitors have made similar investments in their undersea cable infrastructure, too. Google, for example, put $300 million into a new cable system that connects Japan and the U.S. after previously making similar deals in 2008 and 2011.

Starvation is a strong physiological stimulus of macroautophagy/autophagy. In this study, we addressed the question as to whether it would be possible to measure autophagy in blood cells after nutrient deprivation. Fasting of mice for 48 h (which causes ∼20% weight loss) or starvation of human volunteers for up to 4 d (which causes <2% weight loss) provokes major changes in the plasma metabolome, yet induces only relatively minor alterations in the intracellular metabolome of circulating leukocytes. White blood cells from mice and human volunteers responded to fasting with a marked reduction in protein lysine acetylation, affecting both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. In circulating leukocytes from mice that underwent 48-h fasting, an increase in LC3B lipidation (as assessed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence) only became detectable if the protease inhibitor leupeptin was injected 2 h before drawing blood. Consistently, measurement of an enhanced autophagic flux was only possible if white blood cells from starved human volunteers were cultured in the presence or absence of leupeptin. Whereas all murine leukocyte subpopulations significantly increased the number of LC3B+ puncta per cell in response to nutrient deprivation, only neutrophils from starved volunteers showed signs of activated autophagy (as determined by a combination of multi-color immunofluorescence, cytofluorometry and image analysis). Altogether, these results suggest that white blood cells are suitable for monitoring autophagic flux. In addition, we propose that the evaluation of protein acetylation in circulating leukocytes can be adopted as a biochemical marker of organismal energetic status.
The female mountain lion known as P-39 was recently killed while trying to cross the 118 Freeway east of the Rocky Peak exit near Chatsworth, according to National Park Service biologists.
The death occurred on the evening of Dec. 3, but the incident was not reported to the National Park Service until a few days later, according to a news release from the National Park Service.
A biologist picked up the cougar's electronic tracking collar on the freeway, but the big cat's body has not been found.
• PHOTOS: Mountain lion P-39 killed, their kittens unlikely to survive
News of P-39's death comes after a 10-day kill permit expired for another mountain lion P-45, suspected of killing a number of alpacas in the Malibu area.
P-39 is the mother of three 6-month-old kittens whose images have been captured on remote cameras set up by the National Park Service.
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area biologist Jeff Sikich said in a statement that navigating the area's complex network of roads is a major challenge for mountain lions.
The adult female's three young kittens are not expected to live.
“Unfortunately it's unlikely that the kittens have developed the hunting skills to survive without their mom,” Sikich explained.
• PHOTOS: The mountain lions of Los Angeles
This week, Sikich found P-39's damaged GPS collar in the center divider of the freeway, according to the release, which suggests that the collar came off as a result of the impact with the vehicle.
Before Sikich's discovery of the collar, National Park Service officials said, researchers suspected the mountain lion may have been killed because their collar stopped working and they were in the general area of the crash a few hours before it occurred.
But the remains of the mountain lion weren't located, and witnesses who saw the animal did not report seeing a collar.
• RELATED STORY: P-45 cougar drama draws attention to proposed wildlife freeway crossing
Estimated to be 5 years old, according to park officials, P-39 was initially captured and outfitted with the GPS collar in April 2015. The female mountain lion is known to have had at least two litters of kittens, including the three youngsters known as P-50, P-51 and P-52.
P-39 had stayed in the wooded area north of the 118 Freeway since researchers started tracking them in 2015, according to park officials. But a few days before their death, the female had crossed the freeway successfully for the first time.
It is not clear if the kittens were traveling with their mother at the time of their death, according to the release.
P-39, who roamed the Santa Susana Mountains, was not as isolated as Malibu-dwelling P-45, the male cougar who outlasted their 10-day kill permit.
• RELATED STORY: Mountain lions in Santa Monica Mountains face extinction, study says
P-39's death is the 13th known case of a mountain lion killed on a freeway or road in the study region since 2002, according to the release.
An uncollared male mountain lion was killed near the 10-lane freeway in October 2008, officials said.
The area lacks adequate wildlife fencing to direct animals to a hiker/equestrian tunnel sometimes used as an undercrossing that is less than 1 mile away.
Meanwhile, during the 18 months that researchers tracked mountain lion P-3 in 2003 and 2004, they crossed the 118 Freeway 14 times successfully and used the tunnel multiple times, according to the National Park Service. But other animals have tried crossing the road itself with sometimes deadly consequences.
''We'd never made a high-definition optical system before,'' Mr. Milbourn said.
''It was really difficult to get an accurate estimate early on,'' said John Taylor, a spokesperson for Zenith, discussing the price.
The retail price of an HDTV set is also driven by other issues. For instance, Thomson and the other manufacturers all say they do not expect to make or sell large numbers of these extraordinarily pricey television sets. ''I think we'll see a flurry of activity and interest this fall, but not much volume,'' Mr. Meyer said.
Despite the high price, and despite the fact that most of these televisions will be huge rear projectors that will dominate almost any room in which they are placed, retailers say they expect to sell as many as the industry can make.
This may not say a lot, since set makers don't intend to manufacture very many -- probably no more than 100,000 this year. But Americans already buy nearly one million conventional projection televisions a year, including tens of thousands that sell for $5,000 to $50,000.
And when the first high-definition monitor made by a mass-market manufacturer, Panasonic, went on sale Aug. 6 in two stores on the West Coast, one of the stores, Dow Stereo/Video in San Diego, reported that 15,000 people trooped through to see the set over the first weekend.
Dow quickly sold out its first order -- reported by industry journals to be 30 units. And on Tuesday, Thomas Campbell, an executive with Dow, reported that 18 more people had placed orders for the monitor, with full payment in advance. The list price for the monitor is $6,000, though Dow is selling it for $5,500.
But to receive high-definition programming when digital broadcasting begins in the fall, owners of these monitors will also have to buy a digital tuner box. Panasonic's goes on sale in October for $1,700, bringing the total list price to $7,700.

The television industry sells nearly 25 million sets a year, so the sale of a few HDTV's is barely consequential. In fact, the low volume contributes to the pricing problem.
Or, as Mark Knox, a senior manager for Samsung Electronics Company, put it, ''the costs are extraordinarily high because the volume is so small.''
Samsung's first HDTV, a 55-inch rear projection model, will go on sale in November with a $7,999 price tag.
Mr. Knox and others also pointed to another reason for the high price of a set. They said it was important for the industry to show the best products they could at the start, no matter the cost, so consumers who see HDTV for the first time would be impressed.
''Some of these sets are intentionally overbuilt because it is critical that we make the right impression with the consumer at this point,'' Mr. Knox said.
As a result, these first sets are loaded -- like a car that comes with a power sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated seats and a global positioning system. The TV's have fancy multichannel audio systems, digital processors that upgrade the quality of conventional television images and every other bell and whistle normally built into high-end television sets. That's one reason Thomson's first set will cost $8,000 and Zenith's $10,000.
Still, all of the manufacturers swear that the prices will fall -- and fast. This isn't of concern just to them. Television stations that begin digital broadcasting, starting on Nov. 1, are spending millions to make the transition. The money is wasted, they say, as long as the TV sets required to receive digital signals are so expensive that almost nobody has one.
And the Federal Government is eager to speed the transition to digital broadcasting. Every one of the nation's 1,600 television stations has been lent a second channel for digital broadcasts. When the transition is complete, when most everyone has a digital television set, the old channels -- the ones on the air today -- are to be taken back and auctioned for other uses.

The proceeds from those future auctions, estimated now at $6 billion, are already being counted in Federal budget projections. But no one believes the bulk of the population will embrace digital television until prices for the sets fall by 90 percent or more.
Todd Thibodeaux, a senior economist with the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, collects and analyzes sales data for all sorts of consumer electronics products, including televisions. And they said the industry's record showed that prices for new products generally fall by about 50 percent after a decade. VCR's, for example, cost an average of $1,955 in 1974, when they were first introduced, adjusting the numbers for inflation. It took until 1983 for the average price to fall to half of that.
By that calculation, the least expensive high-definition televisions will still cost nearly $4,000 in 2007 -- hardly encouraging to sellers and consumers alike. But manufacturers say such a comparison is flawed.

A year or two from now, many manufacturers, including Thomson, will begin offering several more models. Some will provide a full high-definition picture without all of the expensive extra features. By then, the integrated circuits needed to translate and display the digital signal, now a rarefied and expensive piece of circuitry, will almost certainly have dropped in price considerably.
Today the chips alone contribute $2,000 or more to the retail cost of an HDTV. But these chips should respond to Moore's Law, the computer-industry guideline that says a microprocessor's capability will double, and the price halve, every 18 months.
Given the universal appeal of televisions -- far greater than that of computers -- Mr. Perry, the Mitsubishi executive, said they believed the cost of the microprocessors will drop by 50 percent each year for the next three.
Mr. Knox said an HDTV will probably sell for $3,000 by 2002. Mr. Milbourn said they believed their company would sell an HDTV for half the current price by the time the second-generation models come out in a year or two. Mr. Perry said ''they'll cost $3,500 a couple of years from now.''
That's certainly better than $8,000, but still out of the reach of most television buyers, who now pay $500 or less on average for a new set. In fact, Mr. Thibodeaux's research shows that consumer electronics products reach true mass acceptance only after the price falls below $500.
And how long before the industry is able to sell a high-definition television set for $499.95? Within the industry, that question generally is greeted with heavy sighs and pessimistic shakes of the head. No one is willing to even guess.

What You Should Know
The introduction of high-definition television will bring changes for TV viewers. Here are the answers to some questions about those changes:
Q. When will the first high-definition televisions go on sale?
A. Several manufacturers have pledged to put their first models on the market next month, and others will come through the fall and winter. By January or February 1999, almost all major consumer-electronics manufacturers should have sets for sale.
Several companies already sell high-definition monitors. They have been available for years from high-end manufacturers. Panasonic put a new one on the market early this month, the first from a mass-market manufacturer. These sets are capable of displaying a digital, high-definition picture but need a new, digital tuner to receive the signal. The first of these tuners will go on sale this fall.
Q. If I buy an HDTV set, how much high-definition programming will I see?
A. Residents of the nation's 10 largest cities will be able to watch a small sampling of high-definition programming on 24 network-owned television stations starting no later than Nov. 1.
Under an agreement with the Federal Government, the stations have promised to begin digital broadcasting by that date, but they are not required to broadcast in high-definition. Most have promised to show only a few hours of high-definition programming, principally movies.
By next spring, every network-affiliated television station in the 10 largest cities will be required to begin digital broadcasting. And by Nov. 1, 1999, all of the network-owned and -affiliated stations in the 30 largest cities must go on the air. The rest will begin over the following three years.
In addition, DirecTV, the nation's largest direct-broadcast satellite service, has promised to broadcast two channels of HDTV starting early next year. Unity Motion, a start-up, direct-broadcast satellite company, plans to begin airing two channels of HDTV by Sept. 30.
HBO and a couple of other cable channels plan to begin broadcasting some HDTV early next year. But in the early days, at least, there will be no way to receive any high-definition programming transmitted by cable. The technology for that has not been finalized.
Q. Do I have to buy a new TV? Will the conventional TV's I have now stop working?
A. Maybe one day, but not for a long time. Every one of the nation's 1,600 television stations has been lent a second channel for digital broadcasts. All of the TV stations that are on the air now will continue broadcasting in their regular places, and the new digital programming will appear on the second, digital channel. (Channel 4 in one city, as an example, might also broadcast on channel 54.)

But after a period of years, the Government wants to take one of these channels back, leaving only the digital channels on the air. The present rule says the old channels will go off the air in 2006 -- unless fewer than 85 percent of the viewers in each city have digital TV's by then. No one really believes that target date will be met.
Both the old and new channels will probably remain on the air for many years. In fact, given the politics of this transition, broadcasters are unlikely to give up their old channels until they are ready. Even then, anyone still uses a conventional set will be able to buy an inexpensive converter box that will translate the digital signals for display on the old sets.
Q. When I get an HDTV set, will I still be able to watch all my old videotapes -- movies and the recordings I made with my video camera?
A. Yes. In the beginning and probably for a long time, digital-television sets will also include a conventional analog tuner. That means you will be able to watch digital programming on the digital channels, analog programming on the original channels -- and all of the videotapes, Laserdiscs, DVD's and everything else you have collected over the years.
Q. Is digital, high-definition television better than what we have today? Why?
A. HDTV offers more than twice the resolution of today's television. At its highest level, a high-definition signal holds 1,080 horizontal lines and 1,920 vertical lines, compared with 480 by 704 lines for today's television.
Properly displayed, these images are so sharp, so clear, that for many people the improvement changes the way they relate to television. Often, first-time viewers say they have the impression they are gazing through a window rather than looking at a picture.
But at least as important is the nature of the transmissions. The new system is digital, so televisions can become interactive and carry all kinds of information and data -- not just video and audio signals. JOEL BRINKLEY
According to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll released Tuesday, support among New Jersey residents for decriminalizing marijuana is higher than ever before.The poll found that an overwhelming majority, some 66 percent, of residents believe penalties for marijuana use should be reduced. That's up from 58 percent in a 2011 poll and 40 percent of adults in a 1972 poll.
In contrast, 29 percent of residents reported that they oppose decriminalization.
However, just 49 percent support full-on marijuana legalization with 48 percent still opposed to the idea.
The poll results come roughly a month after state Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) introduced legislation to legalize and regulate marijuana in New Jersey, much like what has already been done in Colorado and Washington.
“New Jersey voters reflect the national trend toward less severe attitudes about marijuana,” poll director and Rutgers University professor David Redlawsk said. “During the 1970s and into 1981, there was some movement on the issue but little policy change so we didn't poll on it again for 30 years. When we finally asked again about marijuana in 2011, we saw signs of liberalization, a trend that has only accelerated since then.”
Gov. Chris Christie has repeatedly vowed to oppose any bill paving the way for legal recreational marijuana use.

It is perhaps in Nusli Wadia's genes to put up a fierce fight when it comes to the crunch. After all, that is how their maternal grandfather, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, carved out a whole new country, Pakistan, in 1947. It could also stem from the fact that the chairperson of the Mumbai-based $2.5-billion Wadia group hates being wronged.
Once described as “the epitome of South Bombay's old money and genteel respectability,” Wadia today lords over an empire that includes textile company Bombay Dyeing, consumer goods maker Britannia, and airline company GoAir.
And today, at 72, this samurai of corporate India is once again bracing for battle, this time positioned against their childhood friend Ratan Tata and India's largest conglomerate, the 148-year-old Tata Group.
It all began last week when, as an independent director with a number of Tata Group companies, Wadia extended their support to Cyrus Mistry, the deposed chairperson of the conglomerate. Mistry was booted out a few weeks ago due to numerous reasons, including their alleged inability to generate adequate profits and their “devious” plan to wrest control of the group from Tata Sons, its holding company.
Since then, the Tata Group and Mistry have been engaged in bitter mudslinging. Mistry has refused to relinquish the chairpersonship of many group companies and has found support from several independent directors, including Wadia. The Tatas have moved legally and are now looking to oust both Wadia and Mistry.
As the drama unfolds further, there will be much at stake for Wadia: their personal relationship with Ratan Tata, whom they have helped over the past two decades—Tata was on the board of Bombay Dyeing for 33 years—and their relationship with the $103-billion Tata Group whose former chairperson, JRD Tata, was their godfather.
Corporate samurai
Wadia started out fighting their own father, Neville Wadia.
Set up in 1879, the famed Bombay Dyeing is one of India's oldest textile-makers and became a household name by the 1970s. In 1971, Wadia senior decided to settle abroad and sell the company to Kolkata-based business person, RP Goenka, owner of the prominent tyre company CEAT Limited. This decision was taken in concurrence with Cyrus Mistry's father Pallonji Mistry who then held a 7% stake in the Wadia company.
The younger Wadia would have none of it, though. ”I don't want to be a second-class citizen in some European country. I am going to live in India. And I am going to run Bombay Dyeing,” they are reported to have told their father. Wadia's lawyers had also told them that their father didn't have the right to unilaterally sell the family's stake.
Educated at Rugby School in England, a 19-year-old Wadia returned to India in the mid-1960s after spending 11 years abroad. They joined Bombay Dyeing as an apprentice on a monthly salary of Rs180 before undergoing its executive training course. They became the joint managing director in 1970.
Wadia managed to acquire 11% of the company's shares. In this, they were helped by their mother—Jinnah's daughter Dina married Neville in spite of their father's disapproval and remained in India even after they founded Pakistan—and JRD Tata, the then chairperson of Tata Group.
The childless JRD had taken a particular liking to Wadia. On their part, the young man considered JRD their mentor. Such was the warmth between them that Wadia even named their younger son Jeh, after the Tata Group patriarch. Evidently, this warmth was missing between JRD and Pallonji Mistry who held an 18% stake in the Tata Group, too. This helped Wadia's cause.
Meanwhile, Wadia had persuaded the company's employees, too, to pitch in with their savings.
With Bombay Dyeing in their kitty, Wadia was now ready for more battles. These included those against tycoons such as Reliance Industries' (RIL) Dhirubhai Ambani and the Britannia group's Rajan Pillai, among others.
The decades-long war with Ambani
Wadia's clash with Ambani to control the country's textile industry was one of the most ferocious in the history of corporate India. It was widely perceived as one between an ancient regime and the nouveau riche.
The Wadias, after all, were one of India's wealthiest and most established business families of the time. The group started out in 1736 when Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia, a Surat-based business person widely considered as the father of the Indian shipping industry, set up a marine construction company that built 355 ships, including the first one built for the British navy outside England.
By the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, Bombay Dyeing had come under serious threat from RIL, led by Ambani, then a young and upcoming textile baron.
Wadia had the licence to import dimethyl-terephthalate (DMT) to make polyester while Ambani had one for purified terephthalic acid (PTA). DMT and PTA are key ingredients in the production of polyester. Ambani emerged victorious by allegedly persuading the government to hike duties on chemicals used to make DMT. A badly-hit Bombay Dyeing had to shut down its plant in 1986.
Not willing to give up, Wadia allegedly used their newspaper-baron friend Ramnath Goenka's publication to accuse Ambani of manipulating government policies.
“To some extent, yes (I did miss the bus), but that's because I chose not to manipulate the system… I want to live by a set of values that is integral to anything that we do,” Wadia said in 2012. “All the policies related to polyester and the polyester chain during the 80s were manipulated. You had to manage the system for all licences.”
The war continues
In the early 1990s, Wadia was called upon by JRD to be their heir-apparent at the Tata Group, which Nusli refused. Instead, they helped Ratan ease into their new role. Together, the duo ensured the ouster of the Tata Group old guard that was revolting against Tata's appointment. “I was helping someone who has been my friend from the age of three,” Wadia reportedly said back then.
Around this time, another front was opening up for what is today the jewel in their group's crown: biscuit-maker Britannia Industries.
Set up in 1892 in Kolkata, Britannia sold biscuits to the British army even during the World War. By 1993, Kerala-based cashew business person Rajan Pillai owned a 38%-stake in it. Pillai later brought in a French partner, Danone.
However, Danone turned wary of Pillai, suspecting that it was being betrayed. With Wadia's help, Pillai was forced to give up control; Pillai then fled to Singapore following allegations of defrauding Britannia. In 2009, Danone, too, sold its stake after Wadia dragged the company to court for allegedly violating a non-compete clause. Britannia also accused Danone of intellectual property violation over the Tiger brand of biscuits.
But that's not all.
In 2000, Wadia thwarted an attempt at a hostile takeover of Bombay Dyeing by Kolkata-based jute business person, Arun Bajoria.  They are also fighting Mumbai-based real estate firm Raheja group over a Rs24,000-crore property in the city.
Today, as they head for another clash, Wadia must apply all the skills of the corporate samurai that they are. The war may not be anything like before. But if there is anything that these years have taught him, it will be that they aren't going to accept anything that would challenge their destiny.

Debt and the Tar Sands
The Occupy Movement has been characterized by, and criticized for, its lack of focused objectives. Originally gathering around issues of economic inequality and debt, it soon ballooned to include every progressive issue under the sun, and then some. Yet amid the cacophony of proposals and messages, we could always detect a hint of a unifying theme. We sensed that all of these issues are somehow connected; we sensed that we were protesting something. What was that thing? What is it now? What is it about current actions to, say, stop the excavation of Alberta's tar sands that makes them Occupy actions? What does ecosystem destruction and climate change have to do with financial inequality?
Just as we suspect, both arise from the same source. Inequality and environmental degradation are written into the rules of our financial system on a level so deep they are nearly invisible. To see how, let us start by asking, Why is it that there is money to be made by excavating the tar sands, but not by protecting the wilderness and the indigenous way of life there? After all, money is a mere social agreement, created by human beings. It is a story – a system of interpretations of symbols that defines value. How have we come to assign value to those activities that are destroying Earth?
The answer has to do with how money is created: as interest-bearing debt. At any moment, because of interest, the amount of money in existence is always less than the amount of debt. The only way to avoid defaults, unemployment and concentration of wealth is for new money to be constantly created through further lending. Lending can only happen and loans can only be repaid when there are profitable investment opportunities: the creation of new goods and services. That is, it can only happen in the presence of economic growth. When the economy stops growing, debt rises faster than income, defaults rise, employment falls, and the concentration of wealth intensifies.
To prevent this, politicians across the political spectrum seek economic growth. Ideally, if the economy grows fast enough, the owners of wealth can keep getting richer by lending money at interest - and the borrowers can get richer too, by increasing their revenues faster than the rate of interest. That plan worked pretty well in the 1950s and 1960s, but today it is becoming increasingly apparent that the planet cannot accommodate much more economic growth. As the growth rate has slowed, economic inequality has increased. For a time the developed world “imported growth” by stripping natural resources and social capital from nations that still had a lot of it. Today, though, these sources of growth are running out as well. We are left with the dregs of the barrel: for example, the Alberta tar sands.
The debt crisis and the environmental crisis are thus two sides of the same coin. In the absence of growth, indebtedness rises quickly, and political pressure to squeeze a bit more growth out of nature – to find something, anything, from nature to convert into product – increases. If we build the Keystone pipeline and drill in the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge and cut down what's left of the rain forests and use up whatever capacity of the atmosphere remains to absorb our wastes, we might be able to force a few more years of growth out of this planet, and temporarily arrest the rise of indebtedness. But unless we can maintain exponential growth forever on a finite planet, the debt pyramid is doomed, and we maintain it only at a worsening cost.
Imagine that you are a debtor and can no longer make your payments. Your creditors, themselves trapped in the logic of money, are ratcheting up the pressure. Surely you could take a second job. Surely you could stop taking vacations, sell your house, eat less, pledge your children's future as collateral. Surely there must be something in your life that, at whatever cost to yourself, you can convert into money, to keep the payments flowing a little while longer. Such is the dynamic driving austerity and the pillage of the natural commons.
In other words, the system is irremediably broken. Even vast redistribution of wealth, say through higher taxes on large incomes, doesn't change the underlying dynamic compelling endless growth. And I think many in the movement intuitively recognize the futility of mere tweaks to the system. That intuition, perhaps, explains Occupy's reluctance to make demands. Any demand that could be framed within the current political discourse (which takes the desirability of growth as a given) is already too small. What we really want is beyond our ability to articulate. But whatever it is, surely a deep change to the money system, with its fool's choice of debt slavery or ecocidal growth, must be part of it.
Another way to look at it is that the same debt that is driving millions into destitution (and which drove many Occupiers to the streets) is also driving corporations and their stockholders to liquidate every bit of nature they can. The corporations also have debts to service, bond payments to make. So too do the governments that are selling off our commonwealth. All of us are in the grips of the same world-devouring machine that chews up beauty and spits out money.
To be sure, the money machine rests on an even deeper foundation. The story that is money is tied to deeper stories, even more invisible: the defining myths of our civilization. These too are in crisis. That is why, at bottom, Occupy is a revolution in our human being-ness. That is why, in Occupy, the long-sundered worlds of the spiritual practitioner and the social activist are reuniting. And that is why we are able to recognize so many seemingly unconnected issues as arising from a common source. Not all have to do with money and debt, but these lie close to the heart of it.
In the case of fossil fuels, habitat destruction, pollution, resource extraction and climate change, the linkage is clear. These are not separate from the original issues that brought people to the encampments. It is the same issue: the insane conversion of the world into product and profit that serves no one - not 99% of us, and ultimately not the 1% either. “We protest not at our exclusion from the American Dream; we protest at its bleakness.” No one wants a system where, to avoid debt peonage or poverty, we aspire to be among the “winners”: those who enslave the rest toward the destruction of all. The money system as we know it prescribes this desolate choice. That system is crumbling. Let us make sure that when it falls apart, there is still some natural, social, cultural and spiritual wealth remaining from which to build a more beautiful world.
It's been a decade since the last entry in Railroad Tycoon — the series that practically made the word "tycoon" into its own games genre — and, as I was told, Simon Hellwig figured that was long enough. The Kalypso co-founder and president wanted one, if not for business purposes, then at least for himself.
Hellwig put Kalypso's in-house studio, Gaming Minds of Gütersloh, Germany, on the case, and now we have Railway Empire arriving at the station sometime before the end of the year. Somewhat like Dungeons 3 (previewed here), Railway Empire appears to be another stab by Kalypso at overtaking long-remembered but lapsed PC gaming genres and delivering their experiences not just to that platform, but to consoles as well.
Hellwig's interest in a railroad tycoon simulation makes perfect sense to me. Kalypso is well known for its series of strategy and builder titles, with users in an unscrupulous or antiheroic role, and wrapping it all in period-piece motifs — like a Cold War banana republic or Prohibition-era Atlantic City — is a pure Kalypso play. The 11-year-old publisher has built steady followings, particularly through Tropico, on such a formula even if the games themselves haven't hit true breakout status.
Daniel Dumont, Gaming Minds' studio manager and creative director, showed me around Railway Empire's landscape at GDC 2017. The game encompasses the lifespan of the steam locomotive in the United States, roughly 100 years beginning in the 1830s, though some diesels are available in-game at the very end.
The campaign mode is built around a single goal, with AI rivals trying to reach it first (the Transcontinental Railroad is a typical example). A series of mission tasks within the campaign, such as laying a certain amount of track or buying out a rival, leads the user to the ultimate goal. Other modes allow users to set their own historical parameters and resource constraints, or go straight to "model making," in which one may build the most impressive railway system without any financial constraints or competition.
Straight away one sees that every choice in Railway Empire is supposed to be a tradeoff. Shorter and more direct routes will increase profit because the locomotives run faster and track maintenance is less. Winding a track so that it bypasses a steep grade change, though, will improve the engine's efficiency, particularly for lower powered locomotives. Structures such as bridges and tunnels add greatly to the cost and maintenance of the line.
We started in San Francisco, building out a single straight shot to Sacramento that picked up some cattle (I guess around Vacaville or something) before dipping into a canyon and chugging up a long grade into the terminal. Dumont said that while satellite data was used to mark the boundaries of the landscape, the terrain itself was massaged (in terms of elevation and water crossings) to be more interesting and present an ongoing series of choices to users — so don't expect the topography to be completely accurate.
Users will have, effectively, two types of engines to put into service: passenger locomotives that are fast but not powerful, and freight engines that are vice versa. Dumont said the game will be playable and winnable by a skilled player focusing on one line of business to the exclusion of another, but it would make sense that a diversified approach is going to deliver higher profits and greater stability.
Newcomers will be able to lay lines and let their trains run without worrying about bottlenecks or collisions — trains will just ghost through one another. Actually, collisions are impossible, even in the harder difficulties where rights of way must be actively managed. Trains proceeding at one another on the same line will just stop until the track is clear. Still, tougher difficulty options with more granular management tasks are included to appeal to train buffs who want full decision-making authority — including the need to pick up sand at a maintenance station before making a long uphill climb into snow.
Train robbers, industrial espionage and sabotage round out the threats a user faces (and may deploy against AI rivals). Tycoons have to staff their lines with personnel who get along, from engineer to railroad detective. The entire landscape can be zoomed down to a street level, and at any point a user may ride along one of their trains. Just remember that time is always passing, and something always needs attention.
The version of Railway Empire that I was shown was played with an Xbox One gamepad, and the process of laying and orienting track, knowing where to put a line, and stopping time to make decisions seemed as reasonably intuitive as the difference between keyboard and mouse and gamepad in Tropico 5, which I've played extensively on console and PC.
Railway Empire is slated to launch by the end of 2017 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Linux, and Xbox One.
SAN JOSE — Police on Tuesday announced the arrests of two men in connection with San Jose's first and second homicides of the year.

San Jose: Taqueria fatal shooting victims identified by authorities
San Jose: Suspects remain at large after taqueria triple shooting kills two Raul Madriz, 27, of San Jose, and Edgar Sanchez, 29, of Sunnyvale, are suspected of gunning down Hugo Sanchez, 31, of Sunnyvale, and Daniel Maldonado, 21, of San Jose, the night of Jan. 5 at La Mejor Taqueria on the 2300 block of Story Road in San Jose.
Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene. A third person was injured by the gunfire but survived.
On Friday, the U.S. Marshals Service, with help from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, arrested Edgar Sanchez at a home in Dade, Florida, said San Jose police Sgt. Enrique Garcia.

Tinder seems to be operating a secretive, invite-only tier of its hugely popular dating app. TechCrunch reports that for over six months, the company has been quietly (and very slowly) growing what it calls Tinder Select, a version of Tinder that a source described as exclusive to “celebrities and people who do really well on [regular] Tinder.” It's not a completely separate app, but rather a separate layer of the core Tinder app that the chosen ones can toggle on and off at will.
It's currently unknown how Tinder decides who should graduate from Tinder for the masses and gain access to Tinder Select. TechCrunch says that the existing pool of users consists of “CEOs, supermodels, and other hyper-attractive/upwardly affluent types,” which sounds like a miserable, artificial hellscape if you ask me. Very reminiscent of The League. Something tells me absolutely none of these people are among the million-plus users paying Tinder to improve their odds of a match, companionship, and reprieve from life's emptiness. (Just kidding: dating apps are probably just fine for finding lasting relationships.)
Either way, sorry regular humans... you've got no easy in right now. Invitees are allowed to “nominate” another person to join the Tinder Select ranks (yes, that's really what the process is called), but that nominee can't extend the same courtesy to anyone else — it's just one hop. Visually, Tinder Select has its own style with navy blue color accents replacing the pinkish orange interface that us common folk see. When reached for comment on Tinder Select by TechCrunch, the IAC-owned company unsurprisingly kept mum.
At least you can add Tinder Select to your list of hated things in this other swiping app and find a match based on that mutual distaste.
SAGINAW, Mich. — A man recently pardoned by former President Barack Obama was shot and killed by two men with assault-style rifles Monday night.
It happened at 9:40 p.m. at Bannum Place Federal Corrections Halfway House in Saginaw, Michigan. Full list of 330 drug sentences commuted by Obama
Michigan State Police spokesperson Lt. David Kaiser told WNEM the two masked men barged into the building and shot 31-year-old Demarlon Thomas of Saginaw.
They were shot multiple times by one of the gunmen, while the other held about two dozen people in the home at gunpoint. Thomas died at the scene.
“One person watched over a group of them while another subject located the victim and executed him,” Kaiser told MLive.com. “They were looking for this person.”
The two suspects then fled the area. No one else was injured.
It wasn't immediately known how long Thomas had been out of prison and living in the halfway house.
Full list of 64 people pardoned, 209 sentences commuted by Obama
Thomas was a former Sunny Side Gang member, according to Kaiser. They were busted in one of the biggest drug busts in Saginaw, known as “Operation Sunset.”
In 2008, they were sentenced to 19 years in prison for the distribution of five grams or more of cocaine. The operation effectively ended the Sunny Side Gang.
Those who knew Thomas, who had also attended college for one year on an athletic scholarship, told MLive.com they aren't a hardcore gangbanger, but a nice person who got caught up with the wrong people.
“He was just happy to be free and have a second chance at life,” Carla Robinson, who grew up with Thomas, told the paper. “I actually talked to them even more before they came home. They were just focused on coming home. Before they even knew about the situation with Obama, they remained, ‘I'll be home one day.'”
Thomas was among the 79 people pardoned on Nov. 22 by former President Obama.
Their jail sentence was set to expire in March.

One thing that generally tends to be true of young players is this: once they've spent a lot of time at a higher level of play (i.e. a different league), you probably don't want them spending much time back at a lower league ever again. There can be exceptions — post-injury rehab stints, unexpected roster changes that push certain guys out of key roles — but for the most part, a step back is a big red flag in a player's development.
For one still-fairly-prominent name in their prospects corps, the Flyers are hoping that they've got an exception to that rule.
When you look at the Flyers' current prospect corps, you can see that the timeline really began with the 2012 draft. Two players from that draft have already been featured in the top 20 of this countdown (Taylor Leier and Anthony Stolarz), while one other one is yet to be featured (Shayne Gostisbehere).
But that draft began with the selection of center Scott Laughton, who — not unlike fellow 2012 draftee Anthony Stolarz, whom we discussed in this space on Monday — almost immediately became the system's top prospect at their position by default upon being drafted, and remained in that position for a couple of years until newer names started rolling in. Laughton's path towards a long-term spot with the Flyers has been bumpy, and this past year looks like a bit of a step back. Can it get back on track?

After two post-draft seasons in (OHL) Oshawa and a fine-if-unspectatular 31-game stint with the Flyers during a 2014-15 season that also involved some time with the Phantoms, 2015-16 was Scott Laughton's first real chance to stick with the Flyers at the NHL level right out of camp. They did just that, with a training camp performance as impressive as that of nearly any other forward on the team.
To say “Laughton's first full season with the Flyers was a mixed bag” would be fair, but the surprise was in how exactly they got to that end-grade. As they came up to the NHL, Laughton was frequently seen as a prospect with a ton of potential as a defensive stopper in the NHL, one who could potentially be a shutdown center and top penalty killer for years to come thanks to their speed, checking, and overall tenacity. On the other hand, there were questions about just how good of an offensive player they would be, with many thinking they may never score more than your average third-liner might.
One full year with the Flyers later, that narrative was almost entirely flipped on its head. Laughton, rather than making an impact as a great defensive player, struggled mightily in their own third of the ice, turning the puck over fairly often and losing assignments more than you'd like to see. On the other hand, their offensive play was likely better than many would have expected — a mark of 1.88 5-on-5 points per 60 (via corsica.hockey) was the fourth-best of all Flyers forwards, and was very comfortably in the range of what you'd expect from a top-6 forward in today's NHL.
Scott Laughton, at this time last summer Laughton was No. 6 in our 25 Under 25 at this time last summer, following their first NHL season. See what Charlie thought about them then.
Additionally, many of Laughton's successes came not at center — their natural position through juniors and the minors — but on the wing, where they spent some time as the year went on. For a player who showed offensive potential but was struggling to handle defensive responsibilities, the move made some sense in the short-term.
All in all, while there were some definite questions surrounding Laughton heading into the 2016-17 season, there were genuine causes for optimism, and there was confidence that the Flyers at least had an NHLer on their hands. How good of one was anyone's guess, and maybe “at least an NHLer” was a disappointing outlook for the former first-round pick at this point in their career in the eyes of some, but the Flyers clearly had something to work with here.
Unfortunately, the 2016-17 season wasn't the step forward that Laughton was hoping to see in their age-22 season.
Mere days before training camp was set to end, an injury in practice sent Laughton to the shelf for almost a month into the season. The injury came after what was generally seen as an underwhelming camp for the Oshawa native, and at the time it seemed like maybe their injury gave the Flyers a chance to kick the can down the road a bit when it came to any potential difficult decisions regarding their spot on the team. Laughton was sent to the Phantoms on a conditioning stint in early November, then was called back up to the Flyers just before Thanksgiving and played in two games with the NHL club.
That second game — on Black Friday against the Rangers — would end up being Laughton's final NHL game of the season, likely in large part due to this turnover that set up the first goal of the afternoon for the Blueshirts.

For the most part, Laughton's two games in the NHL this year — both of which were mainly spent at center, by the way — went fairly well. They didn't score or set up any goals, but they looked the part of a solid NHLer, and basically any on-ice measure you could find said good things about their play in those two games. But plays like the above turnover to J.T. Miller only reignited concerns about Laughton's defensive capabilities in the NHL, as this was the kind of mistake the Flyers were surely hoping to see less of in their second full season with the NHL team.
After that Rangers game, Laughton sat in the press box for five games, and was then sent back to Lehigh Valley, where they remained for the entire season while multiple other AHL forwards (such as Taylor Leier and Jordan Weal) got their shots with the Flyers. And with Weal eventually taking full advantage of their NHL opportunity, the door was pretty well slammed shut on Laughton returning to the team at any point this season. They posted solid point totals with the Phantoms in 60 games and was one of their better players in their first-round loss to the Hershey Bears, but at first, it was still hard to shake the feeling that this was a wasted season for the 2012 first-rounder.
At this point, one could have been forgiven for thinking Laughton's future with the organization may not be long. While they were due a new contract for 2016-17, they were never likely to get a big raise, and they would be waiver-eligible for the first time in 2017-18. Some people (cough) even thought that they were a potential pick in expansion for the Vegas Golden Knights, who figured to be looking for potential high-upside reclamation projects and may have seen someone in Laughton who could benefit from a change of scenery.
At first, it was still hard to shake the feeling that this was a wasted season for the 2012 first-rounder.
But then in mid-June, a wrench was thrown into that last scenario when something very unexpected happened: Ron Hextall elected to protect Laughton in expansion. Over Michael Raffl, over Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, over Jordan Weal, and over a few other forwards that we know the Flyers like. Almost no one saw this particular move coming — none of our staff predicted that Laughton would be protected, nor did over 98 percent of our readers — and it was hard to interpret that move as anything other than a big vote of confidence for Laughton by the front office. Three days later, Bellemare was chosen by Vegas in expansion, and suddenly, the guy who spent two games with the Flyers last year looked like the clubhouse leader in the competition for the Flyers' fourth-line center spot for 2017-18.
It's clear that the Flyers felt like the time that Laughton spent with the Phantoms last year ended up working out well for their development. Despite their stints at the wing, the Flyers have generally said throughout their career that they see them as a center in the NHL, and it certainly sounds like when they came back to Lehigh Valley, the goal was to get them to focus on developing the skills he'll need to be a successful center in the NHL.
Back on BSH Radio in July, former Phantoms assistant Riley Cote spoke about the changes Laughton had to make to their game this past year, and how they should help them to go forward (transcribed by our own Charlie O'Connor):
I think they had a hard time adjusting to a lesser role, [lines] three or four, you know what I mean? I think what he's learned coming back down is that... they didn't play on the power play, they didn't play in offensive situations like that, so I think he's able to absorb more of what they really, truly is. It's not a knock on their ability. But once you get to the NHL, there are so many unbelievable talents, so you have to take a lesser role sometimes. I think for him, he's a third line center probably max on a good team. But I think they have to buy into that role, because there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that role. I think they need to be just a little bit more gritty, maybe cut their losses a little bit more. I think they hang onto the puck too much and gets into trouble, turns pucks over, and so they don't have to carry the puck as much. I think they work hard enough, gets on the puck hard enough, I think they just... we talked about it all the time: “Simplify their game.” Be a hard worker, be a reliable centerman, win faceoffs, kill penalties. There's nothing wrong with that. There are some guys — and I think they had an identity crisis — it's hard to swallow when you're a 90-point guy, almost 100-point guy in juniors. You think you're just gonna hop right into the NHL and be an 80-point guy in the NHL, and it's just not realistic.
Cote isn't the only member (or former) member of the organization that thinks last year went well for Laughton despite what, from afar, looks like a step back. Ron Hextall said on July 2 (a couple of weeks before signing Laughton to a two-year extension) that Laughton “had a terrific year” and “really grew up a lot” in 2016-17. Either people in the organization clearly like what Laughton did last year, or they're doing a really good job pretending they did.
Even despite the glowing reviews and inside track on a lineup spot, Laughton's path to the roster isn't secure. Mike Vecchione is also a candidate for a bottom-6 forward spot with the Flyers next year, and they very well could get that spot over Laughton if the latter struggles in camp. But given what the Flyers did this summer by showing their hand a bit and protecting Laughton, it does seem like the spot is theirs to lose.
And while “a solid bottom-6 center” maybe isn't quite what you hope for from a mid-first rounder like Laughton, if the Flyers can get them to develop the skills of a solid defensive forward and penalty-killer and show those skills at the NHL level, that may be all they need out of him. Some combination of Claude Giroux, Nolan Patrick, and Sean Couturier should anchor this team down the middle into the next decade; a bottom-6 guy who can play defense, skate and score a bit, and even move up to the wing (in a pinch) could fill out that lineup just fine.
Maybe this year was a step back for Laughton. No matter what shine you put on it, the optics of a player spending a full year in the AHL after spending a full year in the NHL are never going to be great. But this seems like it could be a case where a step back isn't a sign of the end, but could instead be a chance for Laughton to take two steps forward to get to where the Flyers want them to be. We'll find out soon enough.

Previously on Philadelphia Flyers Summer 2017 25 Under 25:
Freedom Fest has been touted as “The World's Largest Gathering of Free Minds.” Simply put, Freedom Fest 2015 was unlike any event we've ever attended.
Within minutes of hitting the conference floor, we had opportunity to connect with a plethora of open-minded people with varying religious beliefs, economic theories, and political ideologies. Needless to say, we had some intriguing conversations with some fascinating people.
We decided to attend Freedom Fest for the first time this year with a goal of informing as many people as possible about Follow My Vote and the exciting new project that we are working on, which is the development of an online open-source voting system secured with revolutionary blockchain technology powered by BitShares.
The typical reaction we received, when speaking about bringing our solution to the world, was… “FINALLY!”
It seems that, now more than ever, people are opening up to the idea of involving advanced technology in democratic process here in the United States.
When learning of our project, many conference-goers came to the realization that, in this day and age, we shop online, we bank online, we file our taxes online, we apply for loans online, and much more. We essentially do everything online these days except for voting, leading many of these same conference-goers to ask rhetorically, “Yeah, why don't we vote online!?”
Sack Heads Radio Podcast
As our Founder and CEO explains in a recent podcast, which was recorded live with SHR Media while at Freedom Fest 2015, the reason we don't vote online just yet is that the technological solution to host elections online in a secure way simply didn't exist before 2009.
“What is this new advanced technology that you speak of?” you ask.
It's called Blockchain Technology…
It just so happened that, at Freedom Fest 2015, conference-goers had the opportunity to experience the world premiere of a powerful film entitled “BITCOIN: THE END OF MONEY AS WE KNOW IT”, which talks about blockchain technology and how it was introduced to the world by Satoshi Nakamoto as the underlying technology behind Bitcoin. There were many films featured during Freedom Fest 2015, but this one received the most interest by far, as there wasn't an empty seat in the house. In fact, many people chose to stand in the aisle (before getting yelled at by those in the seats) or in the back of the cinema, if only to catch a mere glimpse of the show.
From there, Freedom Fest 2015 was abuzz about Bitcoin and the many potential use cases of blockchain technology. As stated recently in Freedom Mag, “It turns out Bitcoin might not be the star of its own story—that it's the underpinning technology, known as the blockchain, that has the real revolutionary potential.” This notion is further supported later on in the article; as it goes on to say that “Many believe that, beyond changing the institution-dominated shape of modern finance, the blockchain is a platform for myriad as-yet-unthought-of innovations.”
Within the same article, Follow My Vote was actually recognized for thinking of using the blockchain to enhance the way we vote and for leading a movement behind the concept to do so. This being the case, we took full advantage of spreading the word throughout the rest of the week at Freedom Fest 2015. In doing so, we met with a myriad of organizations, think tanks, entrepreneurs, and investors, many of which expressed interest in getting involved in our project.
For Follow My Vote, the highlights of Freedom Fest 2015 were centered on our interactions with the President and First Lady of the Free Republic of Liberland. Liberland is a self-proclaimed micronation, which claimed a parcel of land (7 km2) on the western bank of the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia, declaring their sovereignty as of April 13th, 2015. The Liberland motto is “live and let live.” Follow My Vote plans to continue conversations with Liberland in hopes to one day provide a transparent, blockchain based voting solution to their government and its citizens.

“This is a non-stress environment. We give them the permission to be a young person,” said LaShelle Richmond, program director at Sasha Bruce Youthwork. The organization operates the Sasha Bruce House in Northeast Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)
Their dreams are scribbled on colorful sticky notes in the house's recreation room. “I aspire to be great,” reads one. “A lawyer,” says another. “I plan to achieve a sense of maturity,” a teenager wrote.
These are the aspirations of the children living at the Sasha Bruce House in Northeast Washington — a place where some of the city's most vulnerable teenagers go when they have nowhere else. Some have run away from home, others have no homes to run back to and almost all feel this teenage shelter is their only safe option.
“This is a non-stress environment. We give them the permission to be a young person,” said LaShelle Richmond, program director at Sasha Bruce Youthwork, which operates the Sasha Bruce House. “They're smart, they're creative, they're leaders, but how do we get to them early enough where they don't end up in the juvenile justice system?”
[No, there is no spike in missing girls in D.C.; how tweets created a crisis]
The Sasha Bruce Youthwork has provided resources and beds to teenagers and young adults in crisis for more than 40 years — long before a string of missing D.C. teens recently thrust the issue into a larger spotlight. About 190 juveniles go missing each month in the District, and some find their way here.

Late last year, a D.C. police official decided to publicize every missing child in the city on social media. News outlets and celebrities on Twitter took notice, calling attention to a perceived epidemic of missing teenage girls in Washington. The Congressional Black Caucus called for an FBI investigation.
Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and interim police chief Peter Newsham tried to assuage public concerns during a news conference, saying there was no uptick in missing teenagers, only a change in how cases were publicized. D.C. police say 99 percent of people who go missing are eventually found.
Bowser said the issue is especially acute in the city's poorest communities, where some think it is safer to run away than stay at home. They announced a plan that would, in part, dedicate more resources to social services that help teens who run away. Sasha Bruce Youthwork could stand to receive more city grants from the plan.

“I've been in this business a long time,” said Deborah Shore, founder and executive director of Sasha Bruce Youthwork. “It's very gratifying to me that people are finally talking about a system that ties it all together.”

The District allocates $2.41 million annually to homeless youth services. The city gives about $200,000 to the Sasha Bruce House each year and about $500,000 to the Sasha Bruce Youthwork's drop-in center on Barracks Row, where children can eat, shower or just talk to someone between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.
Bowser lauded Sasha Bruce's efforts to make stints of youth homelessness more brief and rare in the District.
“They work with some of the most vulnerable young people in our city — reuniting them with their families, connecting them to educational and employment opportunities, and ensuring they have a safe place to turn when in need of shelter or other services,” they wrote in an email.
Richmond, who has been with the organization for nearly 20 years, helps to oversee the house near the H Street NE corridor. Over the past three years, 345 children ages 12 to 17 have stayed in the 10-bed facility. The average stay is about three weeks, a time when staff members work through a child's problems and determine whether it's safe to reunite the teen with family.
The house provides structured days to teenagers often facing turmoil. There are rides to school, art classes and a house dinner each evening before early curfews. On weekends, there are trips to museums. On birthdays, celebrations at Dave & Buster's.
When teens walk through the door, a staff member greets them with pajamas and offers to wash their clothes.
“The first thing we want to do is provide them with the feeling they're safe,” Richmond said. “They can always have a safe place here, but what we really need to do is to get to the root of the problem.”

Richmond hangs their artwork around the house like a proud parent and talks with them about their days. They recall success stories of teens who returned to improved environments back home.
They said some teenage girls think they are in relationships with older men but unknowingly are trading sex for a place to live. Others come from abusive homes. Sometimes, parents don't have stable homes of their own and can't provide a roof for their teenagers. In other situations, pregnant and gay teenagers say they cannot turn to their families, so they turn to the Sasha Bruce House.
“Our young ladies have the most troubling cases, because most of them are trying to find their identity and how to express themselves and fit in with their families,” Richmond said. “The friction builds up with their families, and they turn to the streets.”
For Richmond, their dedication to the mission of Sasha Bruce is personal.
They were born in the District's Petworth neighborhood to a single, 13-year-old mother, raised by their grandmother and mother with the support of neighbors. If they hadn't had that support system, they said, they might have needed services like those they provide.
“I could have been any one of these young people coming through these doors, but I had the resources to take me through that journey” they said. “My dad didn't support me, but look at me now. Your circumstances don't have to define who you are.”
That Ms. Palmer absorbed the basics in a day — their usual instrument is the piano — indicates one of the ukulele's great advantages: it's so easy to learn that it's said to be almost impossible to play it badly. Even when slightly off key, it serves as a blank canvas that can accent the character of any voice. And in the right hands, it can strip a song to its skeletal core.
“Nobody picks up the ukulele who is later going to go back and Auto-Tune their vocals,” said Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields, whose 1999 triple album, “69 Love Songs,” featured the ukulele extensively and was a landmark in its revival. “It definitely sounds untrained, and therefore goes with untrained vocal styles.”
Mr. Vedder has a tidy summation of its advantages: “Fewer strings, more melody.”
The ukulele craze of the 2000s is only the latest in its long history. A descendant of a four-stringed instrument called the machête that Portuguese laborers brought to Hawaii in the 19th century, the ukulele first made a mainland splash in 1915, at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. It had waves of mass popularity in the 1920s and the '50s, but by 1968, when Tiny Tim's “Tip-Toe Thru' the Tulips With Me” became a novelty hit (No. 17 on the pop charts) — and condemned the instrument to punch line status for years — it was already fading.

Its journey back from oblivion began in the mid-1990s, led by a revival among musicians in Hawaii, and since then it has followed parallel paths in independent and corporate culture. In 1999 a spare and wistful version of “Over the Rainbow” by Israel Kamakawiwo‘ole was used in a commercial for eToys, and sparked a ukulele ad frenzy. The recording has been licensed more than 100 times to sell food, software, paint, bank services, lottery tickets and plenty else, and it shows no sign of slowing down.
It's not hard to see the attraction. The light, carefree strum that has become the instrument's sonic stereotype invokes innocence, sincerity and childlike wonder, as well as nostalgia for a pre-rock 'n' roll era. It doesn't hurt that the sound also conforms to ingrained notions of Hawaii as a consumer-friendly earthly paradise.
Those connotations can be narrative gold for visual storytellers, and for advertisers they offer instant humanization.
“Everyone is sticking the tinkling sound of ukulele under their commercial,” said Jim Beloff, who wrote “The Ukulele: A Visual History.” “It's shorthand for lightness of tone. It says, ‘We're good guys at heart.' ”

At the same time that Hollywood and corporate America began turning to the ukulele, a grass-roots uke revival gathered steam. Local strumming societies emerged around the country, aided by the Internet. And, following the Magnetic Fields' lead, the instrument began popping up throughout the indie-rock world: Mirah, Beirut, Dent May, Noah and the Whale, Buke and Gass, Tune-Yards, even a Neutral Milk Hotel tribute band called Neutral Uke Hotel. From there it spread to the mainstream.

The ukulele is all over Train's 2009 song “Hey, Soul Sister,” for example, which reached No. 3, won a Grammy Award and was featured on “Glee.” (And let's not forget the Beatles factor: Paul McCartney paid tribute to the ukulele-loving George Harrison at the 2002 “Concert for George”; four years later Jake Shimabukuro's virtuoso “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” became a YouTube hit.)
As Ms. Palmer sees it, the ukulele is the zeitgeist instrument for the D.I.Y. age. “This is the age of the democratization of music,” they say. “Anyone can be a musician. And in a recession, when you have a $20 instrument and there's a big musical renaissance, anyone will want to join in.”
Sales of the instrument, meanwhile, have surged. Sammy Ash, chief operating officer of the Sam Ash music stores, said they sold more ukuleles last December than in the entire previous decade, along with lots of accessories. “We sell a Metallica ukulele book,” Mr. Ash said, “and we sell a lot of them.”
Perhaps some of those Metallica uke skills will be on display at the New York Uke Fest from May 5 to 7, with concerts and workshops including slide guitar technique and lei making (nyukefest.com).
For most of its history the ukulele has tended to be defined by its limitations: it lacks the resonance of the guitar, the bark and twang of the banjo, and one result is a narrow range of performance styles. In some ways that's the ukulele's strength, a simple, effective strum that anyone can learn. But — aside from the dazzling performances of masters like Mr. Shimabukuro — is that all there is?

Mr. Vedder's album is halfway between the standard uke style and something more idiosyncratic. Respecting one of the instrument's unwritten rules, they play antique songs like “Dream a Little Dream of Me” and “Tonight You Belong to Me” (you may remember Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters singing that one in “The Jerk”). And they exploit the sentimentality of the instrument for all it's worth, singing lines like “For every wish upon a star that goes unanswered in the dark/There is a dream I've dreamt about you.” But on songs like “Can't Keep,” they seem to be trying to cram an angst-y Pearl Jam song through the tiny instrument, attacking the strings.
Merrill Garbus of the band Tune-Yards, whose second album, “Whokill” (4AD), is scheduled to be released Tuesday, is more experimental. Ms. Garbus creates loops of sound using drums, ukulele and their own voice, weaving the elements together over reggae beats and African-influenced vocal melodies.

You'd be forgiven if you didn't hear the ukulele on a first listen. Through various electronic manipulations they have made it sound like a synthesizer, or a distorted electric guitar, or simply short blasts of noise. But listen carefully and you'll hear the tell-tale plink-plink of a ukulele.
“I definitely made it my goal to make the ukulele sound not like the ukulele,” Ms. Garbus said. “I've been amplifying the ukulele through a pick-up and then overdriving it in a really great tube amp, so the texture became not the stereotypical strum of the ukulele. It has these gnarly edges to it.”
Or, as Mr. Vedder explained: “My inspiration was to wrestle with the thing, to give it something different from the way it's been played before. Can I make this happy little instrument as depressed as I am?”
(CNN) -- The 4-year-old daughter of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson died Tuesday, a day after they were injured in a treadmill accident at their home, police in Phoenix, Arizona, said.
Former world boxing champion Mike Tyson traveled from Las Vegas to Phoenix to be at their daughter's bedside.
Exodus Tyson was pronounced dead at 11:45 a.m. local time Tuesday, said Sgt. Andy Hill, a Phoenix police spokesperson.
"The Tyson family would like to extend our deepest and most heartfelt thanks for all your prayers and support, and we ask that we be allowed our privacy at this difficult time," the family said in a statement.
The girl's 7-year-old brother found them on a treadmill in the Phoenix home Monday. They had been strangled by a cord connected to the machine, said Sgt. Andy Hill of the Phoenix Police Department.
"We believe the child was on the treadmill but it was not running at the time. They might have been playing like it was," Hill said.
Them brother called their mother to the room. They removed Exodus from the machine and called 911.
The girl's mother performed CPR on her, but they were unconscious and in need of life support by the time authorities arrived, Hill said.
Former world heavyweight champion Tyson on Monday traveled from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Phoenix where their daughter was on life support in critical condition, police said.
"After a thorough investigation, it appears that this is nothing except a horrible tragedy," Hill told CNN's Larry King. Watch an exclusive report from "Larry King Live" »
About 1,000 children under 14 die of unintentional strangulation each year, 88 percent of whom are under 4 years old, said Larry Stone, founder of Safety Matters, a company that specializes in childproofing homes.
Stone said injuries involving treadmills were fairly common, but said they had never heard of strangulation involving a treadmill.
"All injuries are preventable. There are ways to babyproof your home," Stone said. "I think that largely it is a matter of taking care of the more straightforward things ... making sure there are no cords from the windows hanging and certainly keeping the child in view."

The 42-year-old Brooklyn-born Tyson became the youngest world heavyweight champion in history when they lifted the World Boxing Council title aged 20.
Tyson also won the WBA and IBF versions of the crown during a career that was littered with controversy including disqualification for biting Evander Holyfield's ear during a 1997 title rematch.
They retired from the sport in 2005, but was back in the news this month with the U.S. release of the film "Tyson," a documentary that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last year.
All About Mike Tyson
One of the most exciting areas of innovation and exploration around technology today is also one of the most misunderstood -- biohacking.
Biohacking is the practice of changing our biology and physical situation by employing the hacker ethic -- sharing, openness, decentralization, free access, and world improvement. It's the idea that we can be so much more than we are born with if we just added to our bodies and chemistry.
Over the years we have seen many people use compounds and technology to augment who we are, how we play, and how we operate in the word. Now, technological advancements, access to investment, and the bravery of experimentation means that we are making leaps and bounds in this field.
I personally feel that we are all biohackers to a degree. The idea of hacking is to be curious and to try things that are unconventional, and (potentially) unacceptable. What is normal? 2000 calories a day, drinking and light exercise? Everything else we take in and add to ourselves is biohacking. If you have piercings (ears or otherwise), wear makeup, have tattoos, like a cocktail or two on a Friday night, have an exercise regime, are on a specific diet, own a wearable and actually use that data to change behaviour, or even spend time doing yoga then you are a biohacker. You are changing your born state and becoming so much more. And, there is an increasingly popular movement to go beyond some of those more pedestrian acts. Here are three key areas where biohacking will be going mainstream.
Wearables
Steve Mann, a Canadian and tenured professor at the University of Toronto, and inventor of the field of wearable computing (that is so hot right now) was called the "lunatic fringe" by, Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of MIT's Media Lab when they turned up in the early 1980s. They augmented their vision, ability to capture and process images and make decisions using a wearable rig. Now we see a plethora of tech that more accessible and a little smaller, and this is gaining acceptability and adoption. The Apple Watch flew off of the shelves, and wearable devices like FitBit and other health trackers are commonplace in retail stores.
Exoskeletons
There are two parts to this development. The first is around enabling those that are unable to walk to stand and walk upright (with assistance). I predict wheelchairs will be a remnant of the past within five to 10 years. This opens the world up for so many people and companies that build exoskeletons need to focus on durability and getting the price down so that many people can benefit. Secondly, exoskeletons are already being trialed for work and military purposes. Lift more weight, carry it further, and have less fatigue when operating for extended periods of time. Hopefully this means safer conditions and fewer injuries in the long term.
Implantables
This is the edgy side of biohacking. Last year, at the From Now Conference, I agreed to have an NFC/RFID chip implanted in my left hand by Amal Graafstra of Dangerousthings.com. It was an experiment to see just how easy it was to implant technology and have a simple application of technology. I can now scan my hand and operate RFID locks, password scanners, and even just shortcut to my favourite website. It's a simplified biohack but very challenging to many that find it unethical and challenging. It's not seen as normal behaviour.
Biohacking has always been about the fringes of experimentation and there are a number of developments that excite me. Here are some edgier examples.
Extreme Transplants
Now we are going beyond just using tech and look to transplants as well -- hearts, lungs, livers, and heads. What? Heads? Well, the first head transplant will be taking place soon. Surgeon Sergio Canavero claims to have pioneered a procedure and he's found a prospective patient, a Russian called Valery Spirodonov, who suffers from a terminal muscle-wasting disease. More information can be found here.
Hacking DNA
CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) are segments of prokaryotic DNA containing short repetitions of base sequences and CAS9 protein has been heavily utilized as a genome engineering tool to induce site-directed double strand breaks in DNA. That means breaking bad DNA (that could be inducing effects such as cancerous cell growth or reduced red blood cell generation) and fixing it with good strands of RNA. This has the potential to treat genetic diseases, like cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia, each of which are caused by single base pair mutations. Really complex stuff and head here for more of an understanding.
Smart Drugs
Nootropics and even are starting to be deployed to help augment how people perform mentally. There are many advocates in the startup and technical arena that are starting to use them. There are also a number of online forums, including an active subreddit, where nootropics users gather to exchange stack recipes and discuss the effects of various combinations of compounds. In addition, Nicholas Negroponte who has been predicting the future pretty successfully for the past three decades says the following about what could come in the next 30 years:
"We are going to ingest information. We are going to swallow a pill and know English. We are going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare."
All seems a little wild, doesn't it? There are complex ethical discussions and the medical community is vigorously debating all of these areas right now. How much progress do we want to make? This is about consent. It's about choice. It's about an open mind. But, it's also about integrating and accepting these things into society. That's where things get tough. Meredith Patterson outlined their Biopunk Manifesto in 2011:
"We assert that the right of freedom of inquiry, to do research and pursue understanding under one's own direction, is as fundamental a right as that of free speech or freedom of religion."
We need to fight for the freedom to control our own lives and experiment right now and every day of our lives. Biohacking is here and we need to start accepting that we were meant to be more than we were born with. If we can't, then we need to be tolerant and supportive of those that are pushing the boundaries.

DJ and producer David Holmes is welcomed to the Late Night Tales fraternity with an evocative collection of personal songs and music, peppered with exclusive new material and rare gems.
By now, I think we all know David Holmes, right? There's acid house Holmes, with bone-rattling Chicago jams and Detroit destroyers; break-digger Holmes responsible for the grittily shaking ‘Let's Get Killed' and seminal Essential Mix compilation, and then there's soundtrack Holmes.
Their most enduring and vital source of musical inspiration - cinema - plugged into David's first solo record ‘This Film's Crap, Let's Slash the Seats' and inspired 2000's ‘Bow Down to the Exit Sign'; created as the soundtrack to a not-yet-made movie. Official soundtracks have been bountiful, including scores for Soderbergh's Out Of Sight and Ocean's trilogy, '71, Hunger and Good Vibrations. In a series of personal songs sung by himself, David's last solo album ‘The Holy Pictures' explored influences of La Düsseldorf, The Jesus and Mary Chain and early Brian Eno. Their Unloved collaboration with Keefus Ciancia and Jade Vincent then took us on a musical journey full of raw 60s pop-noir, psychedelia and French Ye Ye with a contemporary twist. Somehow he's also found time to produce records by Primal Scream and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.
Unsurprisingly, for someone au fait with matters cinematic, this Late Night Tales conjures up its own mind-movies. It's not only packed with the judiciously selected nuggets for which their mixes are noted but also stuffed with original material, including collaborations with BP Fallon and Jon Hopkins and an amazing new reading of 10cc's ‘I'm Not In Love' by Holmes-produced Song Sung. In fact, there's a Celtic thread running through the whole journey with Stephen Rea's reading of an extract from Seamus Heaney's AENEID BOOK VI - Elsewhere Anchises. Among the other gems included here are David Crosby's lush ‘Orleans', Buddy Holly's celestial ‘Love Is Strange' and the Children Of Sunshine's ‘It's A Long Way To Heaven'.
David Holmes loves music. It's a way of expressing the sometimes inexpressible or the inconsolable; a questing desire to find out just what is over the next hill. It's no surprise to learn he's a keen walker. Always on the move, headphones on, lost in some reverie or piece of music; the soundtrack to their life, the stuff that feeds their imagination.
" I walk a lot. It's amazing for listening to music: your phone or your emails aren't going and you're just in the forest listening to music. It's so intimate. Anyway, I was listening to the KLF's Chill Out album, which still sounds amazing, but it triggered an idea with concrete sounds through travelling and movement. And one of the things I was trying to do was to use this idea not just break up the moods but also as a metaphor for moving through life and arriving in different destinations or arriving at different stages in different parts of your life.
Memory, Love, Living, Family, Friendship, Healing, Death and The Afterworld are some of the themes I wanted to explore within this record. Although these strong themes and tracks are personal to me, I also wanted it to be a great listen that was unpredictable yet had a seamless flow - a journey that was personal to me yet to the listener a great compilation of music that they may or may not have heard before. I hope I've succeeded in the later. ”

I've been documenting my experiences with a used Nissan Leaf, and I often reflect on just how quickly electric vehicles are becoming a mainstream transportation option. True, they are still a rare sight compared to their gas and diesel counterparts, but I am no longer surprised to see several Leafs, Teslas and Volts each time I leave my home. (It does help that my neighbor over the road drives a Volt.)
If a new report from the analysts at IDTechEx Research is to be believed, it looks like this trend is set to not only continue—but increasingly it will accelerate and expand into all sectors of the transportation industry including industrial vehicles, boats, planes, buses and more.
According to Business Green's write-up of the report, the growth between now and 2026 will be "breakneck"—with the total market eventually reaching $500bn by 2026.
Interestingly, given how much we TreeHuggers prefer electric buses and worry that electric cars still perpetuate bad planning , the report sees much of the growth (and profitability) coming from industrial and commercial electric vehicles as more cities aim to tackle chronic air pollution.
The report also suggests that commercial and industrial markets will be less vulnerable to policy changes than electric cars which, for now at least, are still fairly dependent on tax breaks and/or subsidies to compete with their gas-fueled counterparts. (Of course, this wouldn't be the case if the price of gas matched its true cost...)
“We have a pretty good idea of sort of the architecture of what we're looking at,” Committee Chair Richard Burr said.
Joshua Roberts / Reuters Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr speaking at a Senate hearing alongside Vice Chair Mark Warner.
As the year comes to a close, investigators in the Senate Intelligence Committee's Russia probe have burned through a list of key witnesses, checking off multiple high-profile names in recent weeks as the committee's leadership looks to issue a report before election season starts anew in the spring.
In mid-December, committee Chair Richard Burr told BuzzFeed News their panel was “absolutely” ramping up the number of interviews before year's end. The committee, though it lacks the power to prosecute, will issue a final report with findings about Russia's role in the election, including potential collusion, and recommendations to prevent foreign interference in future elections. Before staff begin writing that report, however, they will interview what Burr has said is dozens more people, completing a witness list that stretches easily into the hundreds and extending what has been viewed as the second phase of the investigation into the new year. “Now we're to a point where I'm not sure we're attempting to learn new things, we have a pretty good idea of sort of the architecture of what we're looking at, but not everybody has had an opportunity to share their version of it with us, and that's why we've got to complete this whole process,” Burr said earlier this month. Burr said that the investigation would have to carry into 2018, but that “it's not going to carry over far. ... The only way that changes is if we learn of individuals that we didn't know about today,” they said. Though Burr and Sen. Mark Warner, the committee's vice chair, have often said they will take whatever time they need to “follow the facts” and finish the Russia investigation, both are also concerned about what the Russians or other foreign actors might do in the 2018 midterm elections.
“Clearly there's some urgency as it relates to election security,” Burr told reporters earlier this month. “I think there are areas of our investigation that we feel that we've pretty much got the answers to, so we'll try to compile that, and potentially Sen. Warner and I will talk about whether we want to push some of it out,” Burr said. The comment appeared to be a reference to discussions around whether the committee should release an interim report before the midterm season begins. Warner and Burr also face political pressure with regard to concluding the investigation, one of the normally secretive committee's most high-profile undertakings in recent memory. For Burr, that pressure has reportedly even come from the president, whose campaign is being investigated by both the committee and special counsel Robert Mueller for potential collusion with the Russians. For Warner, it comes from fellow Democrats eager to take down a controversial Republican administration.
Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Donald Trump Jr. waves at reporters as they depart after a full day being interviewed by Senate Intelligence Committee staff in December.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is — at least publicly — encouraging the committee to take the time it needs to wrap up. “I haven't said, ‘You've got to' — it's not up to me to say when it's over, it's up to them to say when it's over,” McConnell told reporters at a press conference before the holiday break. The public support from McConnell comes as some in Congress and the White House have launched what Warner recently called a “coordinated effort” to undermine Mueller by questioning the impartiality of their team. “Our committee cannot and will not stand as a substitute for Mr. Mueller's investigation," Warner said in a rare speech about the investigations on the Senate floor last week, noting that Mueller's investigation is a criminal one. “I know how much additional information that we're receiving in our investigation,” Warner said the following day at an event hosted by Axios. “We've not reached any conclusions but the importance of what we're doing — and I said a year ago this is the most important thing I'll ever work on, I feel that more strongly today than even a year ago. And we don't even have near the tools that Robert Mueller has in their investigation, where he's already had two indictments and two guilty pleas, and I believe more to come.” Already, the committee — which has opted, unlike its House counterpart, to charge staff with conducting the first round of interviews with witnesses — has spoken with a number of high-profile figures, including Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law; Michael Cohen, the president's longtime personal lawyer; and Donald Trump Jr., the president's oldest son, who was interviewed by the committee in September and again this month.

The committee has also taken aim at social media companies, hauling representatives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google before the panel for a public grilling about what they were doing to address the threat of foreign interference on their platforms. Facebook, faced with the threat of government regulation, has since unveiled measures to improve transparency around political ads on the platform. “We've really put some points on the board already,” Warner said at the Axios event last week, listing “exposing the underbelly of social media” as “the most important piece” and one where the committee has “made the most progress.” Warner listed as another accomplishment the committee's conclusion “that Russians massively interfered in our elections in a coordinated way that was unprecedented,” as well as finding that the Russians “attempted to tap into” the electoral systems of 21 states. As BuzzFeed News first reported last week, the committee has also expanded its inquiry to include other presidential campaigns. The panel has asked Green Party nominee Jill Stein's campaign for documents, and Burr has suggested the committee is also looking at Hillary Clinton's campaign, likely as it relates to the campaign's funding of a dossier alleging Trump-Kremlin links. And the committee has not interviewed Christopher Steele, the former British spy who compiled the dossier, which was first published by BuzzFeed News in January after security officials had briefed President Barack Obama and then-president-elect Donald Trump about it. In October, Burr and Warner held a press conference during which they said they had “hit a wall” in investigating the dossier and had been unable to interview Steele. While there have been reports that Steele is willing to meet with the committee and has already met with Mueller's team, Burr said that although the committee has kept in touch with Steele's lawyers, an interview has not taken place. "We continue to have correspondence and we continue to learn about Chris Steele but we haven't had any interactions with them directly," Burr told BuzzFeed News last week. The committee is also interested in Trump's hastily formed campaign foreign policy team, which was widely panned when Trump announced it in March 2016 for its members' lack of experience. The team included Carter Page, who has been interviewed by both the House and Senate intelligence committees, and George Papadopoulos, who pled guilty to lying to the FBI as part of Mueller's probe in October, and who repeatedly attempted to plan a trip to Moscow for Trump. Burr and Warner told BuzzFeed News before their indictment was made public that Papadopoulos was “a person of interest,” but Warner expressed doubt that the committee would be able to interview him. A source familiar with the matter said this month that the committee was “interested” in or had “spoken with the whole foreign policy team,” but declined to elaborate. Additionally, the committee's interest has spread to fellow lawmakers: specifically, Reps. Dana Rohrabacher, one of Congress's most pro-Russia lawmakers who also met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. Both have been interviewed by the Senate panel and the House Intelligence Committee. Warner said the committee has more staff interviews scheduled for January, but neither they nor Burr has said who the panel will interview next month.

Updated: The Electoral College vote today in Texas was, as expected, an overwhelming win for Donald Trump. What wasn't expected was the number of Republican voters who resigned or defected. Four electors quit and were replaced. The final tally was 36 for Trump and one each for Ohio Gov. John Kasich and for fellow Texan Ron Paul.
The most public "faithless elector" was Christopher Suprun, a Dallas Republican who chose Kasich. Suprun made their choice known in a column Monday in The Hill. They wrote, "Ronald Reagan did not win the Cold War so that Vladimir Putin could pick our next president less than 50 years later."
This fall's bitter election spurred an unprecedented number of "faithless electors." Four Democrats in Washington state refused to vote for Trump's chief opponent, Hillary Clinton. Three of them picked Colin Powell; the other chose a Native American leader from South Dakota. A Democrat in Maine at first voted for Bernie Sanders, was ruled "out of order" and then switched to Clinton. Another pair of Democrats, in Minnesota and Colorado, voted for Sanders and then were replaced with Clinton supporters.
Texas' 38 electors began the festivities at the State House in Austin at 2 p.m. Three electors resigned because of eligibility problems; two are from the northern part of Texas -- Shellie Surles of Fort Worth and Melissa Juett Kalka of Amarillo. One other Texas elector, Art Sisneros from suburban Houston, also resigned, saying they couldn't vote for Trump.
Last week, Suprun told KERA News that he'd received death threats because of their refusal to vote for Trump.
Those comments came a day before a WFAA report that dug into their background.
Earlier this month, Suprun wrote this in a New York Times essay: "Fifteen years ago, as a firefighter, I was part of the response to the Sept. 11 attacks against our nation."
The Dallas television station could find no evidence that Suprun was a firefighter at that point and quoted an unidentified first responder. It also raised questions about parts of their resume.
Suprun did not comment to WFAA. They did respond to questioners on Reddit, saying they were a volunteer firefighter in Virginia at the time of the attack and alleging that WFAA's report "exhibits a reckless disregard for the truth."

As the dust settles on the 2012 draft, it won't be long before the first articles appear extolling the early 2012 playoff favorites. Along the way, some talking head will try to sell you on why this or that division may is the best division in the NFL because this or that player or coach is a sure-fire thing or because this or that free agent acquisition or draft pick will elevate some ho-hum team to championship status.
Don't be fooled by any of that. The NFC East is still the best division in football. Everybody knows it, not everybody likes to admit it. 20 Super Bowl appearances between the four NFC East teams and 12 Lombardi trophies between three of them speak a pretty clear language. The NFC East is the only division to have won a Super Bowl in each of the last five decades. Regardless of which teams win the remaining Super Bowls this decade, no other division will be able to match that feat.
What, you're getting a little tired of the Super Bowl arguments, and want some more recent data to support the East's primacy? Piece of cake.
Here's some more recent data to chew on: Since 2005, the NFC East has won more games than any other division in the NFL. The East has had more playoff teams, has scored more points, has had more yards on offense, more sacks and more 1,000+ yard receivers than any other division. And the East has had only six teams with a losing record in the last seven years. No other division can match any of that. Really, it's not even debatable.
Toughest? Most talented? Most successful? Find out after the break just how good the NFC East really is.
Overall performance by division 2005 - 2011
Over the last seven years, the Cowboys, Eagles, Giants and Redskins have outscored their opponents by a combined 725 points. No other division can match that.
The NFC East has sent 14 teams to the playoffs since 2005. Again, best in the league. The last two seasons were the only two seasons in the last seven years that the East did not send at least two teams to the playoffs (three NFC East teams qualified in 2006 and 2007).
The NFC East racked up a total of 242 wins over the last seven years, more than any other division.
But what is perhaps the most remarkable achievement of the NFC East is the fact that in seven years only six teams have had a losing record in the division: the '06, '09, '10 and '11 Redskins, the '05 Eagles and the '10 Cowboys. The NFC West matched that seven-year total in the last two years alone.
Performance by division

As good as the table above looks for the NFC East, you can't help but wonder what's going on in the West divisions, and the NFC West in particular: Seven playoff spots in seven years. That basically means that the team that sucks the least gets the playoff spot. Not once in seven years did a team from the NFC West qualify for a wildcard spot. The horror, the horror.
NFC East: Home to the most prolific offenses and toughest defenses
Over the last seven years, the NFC East has racked up the most total yards on offense, has more 1000+ receivers than any other division, has scored more points and has recorded more sacks than any other division. That's what you get in the East: prolific offenses and tough defenses.

The East and the mighty Dollar
As much as the NFL is trying to set up a socialist wealth distribution system, ostensibly to ensure level playing field for all franchises, there's no denying that at the end of the day, the NFL remains is a business that thrives on and rewards scale.
Bigger is better in the NFL, and a large part of the success of the NFC East can be explained in simple dollars and cents. The NFC East teams are all within the top seven of the most valuable NFL franchises. And the attendance at their games ensures that the four teams will have a revenue stream to match their valuations for years to come. And don't be fooled by the attendance number in Washington. Three consecutive losing seasons have seen attendance drop from a high of 1,246,219 in 2008 to where it is today. It's not inconceivable that with RGIII signing on in DC, and attendance back up close to the 2008 level, to the four NFC East stadiums will claim the top five spots in terms of attendance next year.

The East is hands down better than any other division, so that begs the question, which division is the second best in football?
(Reuters) - Monarch butterflies west of the Rocky Mountains are teetering on the edge of extinction, with the number wintering in California down more than 90 percent from the 1980s, researchers said in a study published on Thursday.

While much is known about the black-and-orange winged insects' decadeslong population decline in the eastern United States, scientists have been unable to track the western variety accurately until the recent development of new statistical models.
The new study, published in the scientific journal Biological Conservation, was funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which is considering giving monarch butterflies Endangered Species Act protections.
Monarchs, which depend on a diminishing supply of milkweed plants for reproduction and food, are arguably the most popular of North America's butterflies and have a huge international following among students and scientists. However, the western population has fallen to about 300,000 from 10 million less than four decades ago.
“If the population continues to decline at that rate, we will lose migratory monarchs in the western United States over the next several decades,” Washington State University biologist Cheryl Schultz, the study's lead author, said in a telephone interview.
The migratory monarchs of the western United States have a 63 percent chance of extinction in 20 years and an 84 percent chance in 50 years if current trends continue, according to the study.
Scientists believe declines in U.S. monarch populations are linked to human development that has wiped out their habitats, as well as the destruction of roosting forests in California and Mexico, climate change and farmers' increasing use of pesticides that kill milkweed plants and other native vegetation.
“The change has been so dramatic that if we don't act to protect them, they are threatened with extinction,” said Tufts University ecologist Elizabeth Crone, a study co-author.
The western monarchs winter in coastal tree groves in California, only to fan out in spring to lay eggs on milkweed and feed on flowers there as well as in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.
By pairing counts of monarchs wintering in California with historical estimates, researchers determined the decline of the western population was steeper than previously believed.
The eastern and central U.S. population of monarchs, numbering in the tens of millions, is the most studied and is famed for its Mexico-to-Canada migration.
120 Megawatt East Pecos Solar Facility Now Operational In Texas
April 11th, 2017 by Steve Hanley
Southern Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, announced on April 5 that its East Pecos Solar Facility, located in Pecos County, Texas, is now operational. Construction of the 120 megawatt facility began in February, 2016. It is comprised of 1.2 million solar panels manufactured by First Solar and covers nearly 1,000 acres. It will service utility customers in the Austin area.
“The East Pecos Solar Facility joins our growing renewable fleet in Texas, and we look forward to operating it for the benefit of our customers,” said Southern Power President and CEO Buzz Miller. “By providing clean, affordable, wholesale generation, we are able to deliver on our promise to help build the future of energy.”
The facility was built by First Solar, which will also maintain and operate it. Southern Power has signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with Austin Energy, which is purchasing the energy and associated renewable energy credits. The electricity will help meet the Austin City Council goals for renewable energy and carbon reduction.
“Austin Energy was an early adopter of West Texas wind power and is pleased to take delivery of the power generated by the East Pecos Solar Facility,” said Austin Energy General Manager Jackie Sargent. “We currently supply more than 30 percent of our customers' needs from renewable power and are well on our way to our target of 55 percent supply by 2025.” With three solar projects in Texas, Southern Power has one of the largest utility scale solar portfolios in the state.
Southern Power has announced, acquired, or is constructing approximately 3,200 MW of renewable ownership with 36 solar, wind, and biomass projects across the United States. In all, the Southern Company system has added or announced more than 6,500 MW of renewable energy projects since 2012.
Texas has emerged as one of the leading states in the US for renewable energy use. Last December on a blustery day, electricity from wind turbines accounted for more than 45% of all the state's energy needs. The turbines added 15,000 megawatts of electricity to the Texas grid that day according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state's grid operator.

Google's master plan for mobile is finally coming into focus.
The latest development: Andy Rubin, who has run the Android mobile operating system since 2004, even before it was acquired by Google, is stepping down. Taking over Android will be Sundar Pichai, currently the head of Google's Chrome web browser and Chrome OS project. And here's where Google shows its hand: Even as they take on new responsibility for Google's mobile strategy, Pichai will remain in charge of Chrome.
Somewhere in the afterlife, Steve Jobs just yelled, “Boom!”
Google is preparing for hybrid, mobile PCs
The distinction between PCs and mobile devices is blurrier than ever, and Google seems to be setting itself up for the moment when Android (for mobile devices) and Chrome (for PCs) become one.
In 2011, Google executive chairperson Eric Schmidt said that Android and Chrome OS would some day fuse. Android currently runs the majority of smartphones in the world, while Chrome OS is Google's successful but still nascent attempt to provide people with an alternative to Windows on their notebook and desktop PCs. Putting a single person in charge of both Android and Chrome at once is rather transparently the fastest way to get both projects headed toward some kind of union.
Schmidt has also said that Chrome OS is for devices with keyboards, and Android is for devices without. But as the world fills with all manner of hybrid beasts—tablets with keyboards, laptops that convert to tablets, smartphones that become tablets, gigantic smartphones and even notebooks designed to run Windows and Android simultaneously—it's apparent that these distinctions are, if not exactly meaningless, then at least increasingly unhelpful. People are having fun with and getting work done on whatever device is at hand. Call them mobile PCs.
This explains Google's Chromebook Pixel
AP/Jeff Chiu The baffling, tantalizing Chromebook Pixel.
Google recently released the Chromebook Pixel, a high-powered laptop that only runs its own Chrome OS. The operating system is good, but it isn't nearly as capable as Windows or Mac OS X, and its primary talent right now is a great web browsing experience and native integration with Google's cloud services like Gmail and Drive. In other words, it's great for cheap laptops, but Chrome OS simply isn't doing anything taxing enough to warrant all the horsepower and expense of the Chromebook Pixel. Reviewers savaged it accordingly.
But now we see where Google is going with all of this. Like the operating system that runs on Apple's iPhones and iPads, one of the strengths of Android is its enormous library of “native” apps—that is, applications that you download to the device before using. Native applications can do things web-based applications still can't, like intensive video editing and high-end gaming.
Once Google fuses Android and Chrome OS, Chrome will get the huge library of native applications that it currently lacks, and Android could gain the desktop-like features that make Chrome so useful for getting real work done. Some of these advantages are quite simple: Chrome has true “windowing,” which means that the web applications running on it can be run in individual windows instead of browser tabs or, as is common in mobile operating systems, as full-screen apps.
But how will Google avoid the Windows 8 trap?
AP/Elaine Thompson Valve CEO Gabe Newell called Windows 8 “this giant sadness.”
If all this sounds familiar, it's because the exact same vision animated Microsoft Windows 8, which puts a mobile and tablet-friendly interface alongside regular old Windows. But most people have found that fusion leads to unacceptable compromise.
Here's the key difference for Google, if Chrome and Android merge: Google does not have to support a huge population of existing users of its desktop operating system. Chrome OS is only four years old, and it wasn't until recently that cheap laptops pre-loaded with Chrome OS made it the least bit mainstream.
Microsoft's strength is also its weakness: Millions of businesses have built applications on top of Windows that Microsoft must support with each successive version of Windows. Google's primarily obligation, on the other hand, is to the hundreds of millions of people who already use Android, a lightweight, stable, constantly improving operating system that is already close to being capable of allowing users to do “real” work with it.
Unburdened by the need for backwards compatibility and empowered by all the lessons tallied so far by the PC industry, Google has the chance to create an operating system that spans all devices and is truly workable—not just a kludge like Windows 8.
Android + Chrome OS is a moneymaker
AP/Ahn Young-joon With Google selling hardware like its Nexus 7 tablet more or less at cost, the company remains dependent on advertising.
Currently, Google doesn't charge a licensing fee to the companies, like Samsung, that make billions of dollars selling mobile devices that run Android. Google's only way to make money directly from Android is through the Google Play Store, where it sells apps, and so far the Play store is not a material portion of Google's income. (Of course, Google-approved versions of Android keep people using Google's services, where the company can place advertising.)
But a fused Android and Chrome OS opens up a number of new potential revenue sources for Google. Foremost among them is simply charging for future Google services. While Gmail might always be free, Google is happy to charge users to store their data. As people move more and more of their lives to the cloud, Google could potentially lock them into life-long subscriptions to its data storage and other services.
Google is already accomplishing this at the enterprise level with the per-user subscriptions to a suite of Google apps.
Let the age of cloud-based personal computing begin
Google's move to fuse Chrome OS and Android is perfectly in line with its identity as an internet company. Chrome OS epitomizes Google's view that no matter what device you pick up, simply logging in should present you with the same experience, no matter what. Google recognizes that what users want isn't control but fluidity.
People want that moment in the movie Avatar, when a character swipes a document from a flat panel monitor onto their tablet computer, so they can carry it around with them as they walk. We live in an age in which, Google Docs and iCloud and Microsoft Office 365 notwithstanding, the dominant method for sharing data between computers, even computers owned by a single person, is still email. What we could have, instead, is a single unified digital life that is abstracted into the cloud. In this world, every device, no matter its size or capabilities, is simply a window into our online workspace. A world in which all screens are created equal.
Google is trying to realize this vision, but so far its expression—force users into a Chrome OS in which everything is run through the browser—has felt limited. But these are the early days, and the company's larger ambitions have yet to be realized. The only question is, will it be called Chandroid or Androme?
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, left, looks at China's President Xi Jinping walks to their seat during a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Saturday, Sept. 30, 2017. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool)
BEIJING (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged on Saturday that the United State is maintaining direct channels of communications with North Korea even as tensions rise over the North's nuclear and missile programs and the countries' leaders spar through bellicose name-calling.
Tillerson said the U.S. was probing North Korea's willingness to talk, and called for a calming of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, adding it was incumbent on the North to halt the missile launches.
“We have lines of communication to Pyongyang. We're not in a dark situation, a blackout,” Tillerson told reporters during a visit to China. “We have a couple ... three channels open to Pyongyang. We can talk to them, we do talk to them.”
No elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions came from Tillerson, who met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top officials in Beijing.
While Tillerson affirmed that the U.S. would not recognize North Korea as a nuclear power, they also said the Trump administration had no intention of trying to oust Kim. “Despite assurances that the United States is not interested in promoting the collapse of the current regime, pursuing regime change, accelerating reunification of the peninsula or mobilizing forces north of the DMZ, North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war, and the Demilitarized Zone divides North and South Korea.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the U.S. has restored a diplomatic back-channel between the State Department and North Korea's mission at the United Nations. That's traditionally been a way for the two sides to communicate because they lack formal diplomatic ties.
The main aim of the initial contacts was to seek the freedom of several American citizens imprisoned in North Korea, although U.S. officials have told The Associated Press that there were broader discussions about U.S.-North Korean relations. Those contacts, however, have failed to reduce the deep mistrust between the adversaries and it's unclear to what extent they have endured the current spike in tensions.
North Korea has in recent months tested long-range missiles that potentially could reach the U.S., and on Sept. 3 conducted its largest nuclear test explosion to date. The standoff has entered a new, more dangerous phase since then as North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Trump have exchanged personal insults and threats of war.
“I think the most immediate action that we need is to calm things down,” Tillerson said. “They're a little overheated right now. And I think we need to calm them down first.” They did not directly address the impact of Trump's own rhetoric.
“Obviously it would help if North Korea would stop firing off missiles. That would calm things down a lot,” Tillerson said.
Trump gave a combative speech recently at the U.N. General Assembly in which they mocked Kim as “Rocket Man” on a “suicide mission.” Trump said that if “forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” Kim responded by saying they would “tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.”
Tillerson's stop in the Chinese capital was helping lay the groundwork for a November state visit by Trump, part of a five-nation swing through Asia. Trump has pressed for sterner measures against the North by China, the North's chief trading partner and source of aid and diplomatic support.
Beijing adamantly opposes steps that could bring down Kim's government, but appears increasingly willing to tighten the screws. China has agreed to tough new U.N. penalties that would substantially cut foreign revenue for the isolated North.
On Thursday, Beijing ordered North Korean-owned businesses and ventures with Chinese partners to close by early January, days after it said it would cut off gas and limit shipments of refined petroleum products, effective Jan. 1. China made no mention of crude oil, which makes up the bulk of Chinese energy supplies to North Korea and is not covered by U.N. sanctions.
China has banned imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ore, and seafood since early September. Still, Washington hopes China will exert even greater pressure.
China argues that sanctions alone cannot solve the impasse, and has urged Washington to cool its rhetoric and open a dialogue with North Korea. But the North is coming closer to having a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike America, and says it will only discuss the weapons programs if the U.S. abandons its “hostile policy” toward the North.
This was Tillerson's second visit to China as America's top diplomat. China is the world's No. 2 economy and chief U.S. rival for influence in Asia, and increasingly, the world.
In addition to North Korea, the U.S. and China have other security concerns to address.
They are at odds over Beijing's military buildup and assertive claims to disputed islands in the South China Sea. Trump is also looking to reduce China's massive trade surplus with the U.S. — $347 billion last year — and what American companies say are unfair barriers to investment, including pressure to hand over their technology.
In opening remarks at their meeting with Xi, Tillerson said relations between the sides continue to “grow and mature on the strength of the relationship between yourself and President Trump.”
They added: “We look forward to advancing that relationship at the upcoming summit.”
Trump and Xi met in April at Trump's estate in Florida. Trump's planned visit next month will come weeks after Xi is expected to receive a new five-year term as leader of the ruling Communist Party.
The presidents' upcoming meeting promises to be grander and more choreographed than the informal talks in Florida that were most memorable for Trump's ordering a missile strike on Syria and then informing Xi about it afterward as they ate chocolate cake.

More refugees forced to flee across border into Turkey as Foreign Office advises Britons in Syria to leave immediately
Syrian troops swept into the village of Bdama near the Turkish border on Saturday, forcing more people displaced by the crackdown on anti-government protesters to flee across the frontier.
The Local Coordination Committees, a group that documents protests, said troops backed by six tanks and several armoured personnel carriers entered Bdama in the morning. Bdama, about 12 miles from the Turkish border, had a bakery that was the sole source of bread for nearly 2,000 displaced people crowded near the border who had hoped not to have to flee to the Turkish tent-city sanctuary. The town was also supplying medicine and other foodstuffs to them.
Some women and children were already crossing into Turkey.
The three-month uprising against Syrian president Bashar Assad's rule has proved resilient – despite a relentless crackdown by the military, pervasive security forces and pro-regime gunmen. Human rights activists say more than 1,400 Syrians have been killed and 10,000 detained as Assad tries to maintain their grip on power.
Along the border Saturday, those displaced near Bdama said they were running short of supplies.
"We still have some potatoes, rice and powdered milk but they will run out soon," said Jamil Saeb, one of the Syrians who had so far decided to stay in Syria. "This is our first day without bread."
Saeb said there are children who are sick and there is no medicine. Others are picking apples for lack of other food.
"We are living in catastrophic conditions," they said.
"We are besieged by the border fence from one side and the Syrian army from the other," Saeb said by telephone. "We are expecting a humanitarian crisis within hours if Turkey does not send aid to us."

The Foreign Office, meanwhile, has urged Britons in Syria to leave the country "immediately." In a statement, the Foreign Office said Britons should leave "now by commercial means while these are still operating."
The statement said those who stay should understand it would be unlikely the British embassy in Damascus could provide a normal consular service if there was a "further breakdown in law and order."
Britain, France, Germany and Portugal will be sponsoring a draft resolution at the UN Security Council to condemn Syria.
It turns out Ronaldo Souza vs. Vitor Belfort won't be a five-round fight.
Initially planned as the main event of a UFC Fight Night card on May 14 in Brazil, the middleweight showdown was moved to the co-main event spot, "Jacare's" manager Gilberto Faria told MMAFighting.com on Thursday.
The promotion has yet to officially announce its plans for the May 14 event in Brazil, but a report from Combate indicates that it could be moved from Fox Sports 1 to pay-per-view, labeled as UFC 198, and feature Fabricio Werdum vs. Stipe Miocic for the heavyweight championship in the main event.
"‘Jacare' is going in for a fight on May 14," Faria told MMAFighting.com. "It's confirmed we're not in the main event anymore, but it's not clear yet which is the main event. The fight went from five rounds to three, which favors Belfort."
"A five-round fight would favor ‘Jacare' because of their endurance," they continued, "as he's fought five rounds before, and people see Belfort as a dangerous opponent in the first rounds, so they would have to be more careful in the early rounds. They are both going for the finish, so I never saw this fight going five rounds anyway."
The UFC has yet to announce the exact location for the event, but sources in the promotion indicate that Brasilia, which held Antonio Silva vs. Andrei Arlovski in September of 2014, is the most likely choice. Curitiba and Fortaleza are other options on the table.
Being a main event or not, Faria expects the fight to be a shortcut for the top of the division after Souza's close decision loss to Yoel Romero in December.
"‘Jacare' and Belfort know that a win is the perfect shortcut for the belt," said the manager. "It turned out great for everyone. It's a good challenge for both, and we guarantee ‘Jacare' will be ready for it. We're fans of Belfort for a long time, we like him, but we're thinking about ‘Jacare's' career only. Our plan is to close the distance and finish the fight on the ground, but ‘Jacare' also likes to strike and will be ready for it."
UFC middleweight champion Luke Rockhold will defend their title for the first time against Chris Weidman at UFC 199, and Faria believes the new champion is avoiding a rematch with the Brazilian. Souza and Rockhold fought for the Strikeforce gold back in 2011, and Rockhold won the fight via decision.
"Our friend Rockhold doesn't mention ‘Jacare's' name anymore," said Faria. "He talks about fighting Anderson (Silva), Belfort, but won't talk about ‘Jacare'. They fought ‘Jacare' once and knows it's a tough fight. They know they have limited chances at winning. He's avoiding bringing ‘Jacare's' name up again so they avoid this fight."
A reporter and photographer for a Virginia television station were killed Wednesday after a shooting during a live broadcast from a shopping center, the station reported. Authorities said the suspected gunman, 41-year-old Vester Lee Flanagan, has died at the hospital after shooting themselves while fleeing from police.
Flanagan, who investigators said went by “Bryce Williams” on air, had been hospitalized after speeding away from troopers on the interstate and crashed a car off the side of the road, Virginia State Police said. They were found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and was being treated for life-threatening injuries at Inova Fairfax Hospital in northern Virginia before they died.
Police said Flanagan opened fire on Alison Parker and Adam Ward, who worked for WDBJ, the CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Va., while they were doing a story in Moneta, Va., around 6:45 a.m. Wednesday.
The woman Parker, the reporter, was interviewing was also hurt in the shooting. Vicki Gardner, executive director for the Smith Mountain Regional Chamber of Commerce, underwent surgery but is in stable condition, according to Chris Turnbull, spokesperson with Carillion Clinic in Roanoke.

Video shows Parker interviewing Gardner about tourism on Bridgewater Plaza in Franklin County, about 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. They were smiling when suddenly at least eight shots were heard. Parker screams, runs and can be heard saying, “Oh my God.”
As the camera drops to the ground, it captures what appears to be a fleeting image of the shooter. The person is wearing black pants and a blue top and appears to be holding a handgun.
The station then switches back to a shot of an anchor back at the station, who has a shocked expression on their face.
Flanagan fled the scene before deputies arrived, and drove their 2009 Ford Mustang to Roanoke Regional Airport, Franklin County Sheriff Bill Overton said during an afternoon news conference. The gunman then fled the airport in a Chevrolet Sonic they rented earlier.
Virginia State Police Sgt. Rick Garless said a trooper found Flanagan on Interstate 66 in the northeast portion of the state and tracked them until backup arrived. Flanagan refused to pull over and crashed their vehicle off the side of the road. Authorities found them with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. They were airlifted to a hospital, where they later died, the sheriff said.
Investigators haven't uncovered a motive in the shooting but are conducting a homicide investigation. The slayings of Parker and Ward mark the first two deaths of journalists in the United States since 2007, according to the Florida-based Poynter Institute for Media Studies.
WDBJ General Manager Jeffery Marks said on air that Flanagan worked for the station two years ago but was let go after months of disruptive behavior. Once they were fired, Flanagan, who Marks called an “unhappy man,” was ushered out of the station by police. They told CNN there was no indication Flanagan had any reason to target Ward and Parker, although they remained in town after they left the station and made accusations against employees some time ago.
“I don't think Alison or that individual overlapped here,” Marks told CNN. “I can't figure out any connection with those people.”
A Twitter account with the profile name “Bryce Williams” was suspended earlier Wednesday after someone claiming responsibility for filming the shooting tweeted a video from the gunman's perspective firing on Parker and Ward. The video was also posted on Facebook, which deactivated an account belonging to “Bryce Williams.”
The user of the “Bryce Williams” Twitter account posted messages making accusations of racist comments at the workplace and claiming that they filed a report with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Marks confirmed to The New York Times that the complaint had been filed, but said it was dismissed as baseless. They said the racist comments could not be corroborated, The Times reported. “We think they were fabricated.”
It wasn't the first time Flanagan had alleged racism in the workplace. In 2000, they sued WTWC-TV in Leon County, Fla., where they worked as an anchor, according to court documents.
Among a series of complaints about co-workers and supervisors using racial epithets in reference to black crime suspects and interview subjects, Flanagan claimed a producer referred to them as a “monkey” and they were fired after reporting the slurs to the EEOC and Florida Commission on Human Relations, court documents show.
The news station denied Flanagan's allegations, saying in court documents that they were terminated for poor performance, misbehavior towards co-workers, refusal to follow directions and their use of profanity on the premises.
Alison Parker: ‘People wanted to be around her'
Parker, who recently celebrated their 24th birthday, had worked on WDBJ's morning team since 2014. Before that, they worked for more than a year as the Jacksonville bureau chief for WCTI NewsChannel 12 in New Bern, NC, according to their station and LinkedIn bio.
“She was the most radiant woman I ever met,” tweeted Chris Hurst, a WDBJ anchor who was dating Parker. “And for some reason they loved me back. They loved their family, their parents and their brother.” Hurst said the two had recently moved in together and wanted to get married.
Scott Nichols, news director for WCTI, said they hired Parker in December 2012 as a general assignment reporter just months after college. Even then, they had a great personality and impressive professional drive, they said.
“From the initial phone interview to all of their time here, they loved this business and just wanted to cover any type of story and grow,” they said. “She would be, after hours, at the magistrate's office looking for documents and news stories...if there was breaking news in the morning and weekend.”
Nichols said they kept in touch with Parker even when they left the station last May. Just over a month ago, they called them for career advice, they said.
“She was just one of those happy, always positive, always energetic people,” they said. “People wanted to be around them They were an awesome person.”
Adam Ward: ‘Full of life'
Ward, 27, had been a photojournalist at WDBJ since 2011, according to their LinkedIn profile. Photographer Adam Ward was planning to move to Charlotte with their fiance Melissa Ott, who had just accepted at job at WSOC (Channel 9). Ott was a morning producer at WDBJ and was marking their last day at the Virginia station on Wednesday. They were in the control room during the shooting, CNN reported.
“Adam was our go-to guy,” WDBJ spokesperson Mike Morgan said. “He pretty much was available to do anything that we asked. They did live shots during our morning show for several years.”
T.J. Eberle, a Charlotte entrepreneur and business owner, said Ward had been their nephew's best friend in high school and roommate in college at Virginia Tech. As Ward and Ott prepared to move into an apartment in Ballantyne, Ward told Eberle that they were ready to leave the news business and asked for help in finding a new career.
They last spoke on Sunday.
Said Eberle: “One of the things I found interesting was the comment they made to me, they say, ‘You know TJ...I'm a little burned out in this job, going to film people's worse days, whether it be a fire or crime scene.'”
Eberle said they compiled a list of about 20 people they were going to speak with to help Ward land a job in marketing or public relations.
“I literally have their résumé sitting on my coffee room table right now,” Eberle said Wednesday morning. “To see the news this morning and see it unfold is just shocking and heartbreaking. They were full of life. They certainly enjoyed sports and always had a smile on their face.”

Burton just unveiled the 2014 Sochi Olympic snowboarding uniforms. What do you think?
BURLINGTON, VT (December 4, 2013) Today, Burton Snowboards is honored to officially unveil the 2014 U.S. Snowboarding Team uniforms that all riders representing the United States will wear during competition at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The Sochi Games will mark the third consecutive Olympics where Burton has partnered with U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association (USSA) to create one-of-a-kind uniforms designed for riders, by riders. The pinnacle pieces of the uniform consist of technical outerwear jackets and pants, and in addition, Burton is also supplying the 2014 U.S. Snowboarding Team with hats, gloves, base-layers and fleece to wear while competing.
To design the uniform for the 2014 Sochi Games, Burton once again turned to America's heritage for inspiration. And nothing represents Americana more than handcrafted patchwork quilts and the American flag, which are both at the heart of the 2014 uniform. After a long hunt, Burton designers found the perfect vintage quilt at an antique fair. Then, they brought it home to Vermont where it was deconstructed and re-constructed by a veteran Vermont quilt maker in order to get it ready to replicate onto the outerwear fabrics. Following this, Burton developed a method to print exact replicas of both the quilt and a vintage American flag onto the fabric of the jackets. The end result is that the quilt pattern on the jackets looks like it was hand-stitched with patchwork squares – just like the original. And an exact duplicate of the vintage American flag is proudly featured on the jacket's sleeve. With the design inspiration in place, the next step was to ensure that the outerwear would perform at Burton's best-in-class standards so that the athletes are warm and dry in the unpredictable weather conditions that could be encountered in Sochi. So, Burton turned to the U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center to research and develop Burton's all new DRYRIDE Vaporshell laminate, which is showcased for the first time in the Olympic Competition Jackets. The end result is a super waterproof and breathable fabric that can stand up to any weather condition.
The Burton Olympic Competition Pants were also designed with considerable care and attention to detail. Corduroy was chosen for the pant fabric since it has been a staple of American clothing for generations. To ensure the highest level of performance, Burton sourced a highly technical corduroy fabric (also featured on the shoulders of the Competition Jacket), which is weatherproofed with Burton's new DRYRIDE Nanoshell laminate that features a waterproof/breathable membrane to keep the riders warm and dry. To round out the outerwear, Burton also designed all items that will be worn under the jacket and pants, including first-layer bottoms and tops, three different beanies, gloves/mitts and a cozy wool/silk blend competition pull-over fleece.
Michael Jaquet, the Chief Marketing Officer for USSA added, "USSA is proud to have snowboarding's most iconic brand as our Olympic Team Uniform partner. Burton has once again raised the bar on design, function, and style with this kit and we congratulate them on once again capturing both the Olympic and American spirit in a uniform the athletes will be proud to wear."
Wargaming.net are expanding on the phenomenal success of World of Tanks by throwing their lumbering World War II machines into the air and hoping everything isn't going to come crashing down. Adopting the same model as its predecessor, World of Warplanes has you accruing credits to buy new, faster, flashier planes with which to dominate the airspace with. But nailing the slow, ponderous pace of tanks where terrain and positioning are just as important as skill and teamwork isn't quite the same as achieving success once the theatre of war is dogfighting and bombing runs.
Welcome to PCGamesN.com. We're a brand-new site covering the best and biggest PC games. Want more World of Tanks features? You've come to the right place.
The instant you're hit, the certainty of your continued existence goes out of the window. The fundamental difference between a tank and a plane is that, once the engine of a tank stops working, it's still a pretty dangerous threat, because it's going to sit there with its big old cannon firing big old shells in your general direction. You can still get kills with a damaged engine, in World of Tanks.Get your engine hit, or your engine on fire, or your wing shredded into a useless frame of wood and metal, and you can't turn into a stationary turret, firing on incoming fighters. You are going to /drop/. You're going to struggle to keep this writhing animal in the air, and you aren't going to be doing anykilling.Once you're hit, the dice start rolling. And it's everything you can do to keep yourself from becoming a smear on the ground of mainland France.
It's this uncertain fragility that makes World of Warplanes altogether more thrilling than it's slower paced older brother. Playing through my first few games, there was something liberating about being one of the smaller, more agile biplanes. All the big boys, the players that have played for months and months, had vast fighter bombers, or at least something that is built more for speed and durability than manoeuvrability. It means you can turn tighter circles, and spin speedier barrel rolls once they're on your six.It also means you're basically a paper plane, waiting for some dick with a BB gun to come along and punch some holes in your delicate aerodynamics. You go down fast, and you go down hard. The trick is staying out of strafing lines.The credits come in fast, though, giving you more than enough to upgrade within a few victories, or a few more defeats. You can grab yourself a Warhawk, somewhere on the fighter-bomber spectrum, but much closer to fighter than bomber. The difference is immediate, and drastic, leaving you tailing behind as the lighter fighters on your team start to elevate, headed for the heavens so that they can rain down hell. You're stuck in the purgatory of a thousand feet or so, which is right in the firing line.Altitude is what separates the classes of plane, like oil and water. The big guys stay low, headed for the enemy emplacements, while the little guys flit among the clouds, duelling with one another before swooping down to mop up the cumbersome heavies.
Each game has a pair of victory conditions, each one leading you to the win screen if you can pull it off. Either you can destroy enough of the enemy base to slip into victory, or you can wipe out the entire enemy force, or at very least achieve air superiority, should they be cowards and hide down in canyons and low, rolling hills.It means there's this odd mix of all out gunning it at one another and hanging back, waiting for the more heavy-hitting bomber classes and then dealing with those. If all your fighters climb and climb to deal with the opposing swarm, you're going to be left defenceless when those big bastards come creeping up your flanks. But if you don'thead up, you're sacrificing the higher ground to the enemy, and you're going to end up dive bombed to oblivion.The difference in plane type makes itself abundantly clear the instant you find yourself in the pilot seat, too. The smaller the plane the easier it pitches and yaws, whereas they might find their engine pootling out before you even reach 400kmp/h. On the other hand the bigger chassis take a bit more work to wrestle into a turn, but their larger engines let them zip along. The controls themselves seem intuitive enough, although there's more than enough functions in the bindings to make me ignore a vast swathe. Instead I just mapped the essentials to my gamepad, and got straight to work.
There is a threat that by sacrificing hills and towns for wide open spaces a lot of the tactics that make World of Tanks so compelling are going to be lost, but by that same token those hills and towns are still there, they're just a thousand feet below you. I've seen planes sweep down into a canyon to lose a tail, only to surge upwards and force themselves into a stall, so that they can end up behind their pursuer. The availability for tactics is still there, it's just more esoteric this time around.Similarly, right now there's a problem in a frustrating amount of time between each game, for the most part taking upwards of two or three minutes before it finds a game. Sometimes it's absolutely fine, with only a few seconds between hitting the button and finding yourself in a game, but so far it's the most glaring, obvious flaw. But then this is a beta, and that's precisely the sort of thing that will improve over time.There's no reason to think World of Warplanes isn't going to mirror the success of Wargame's previous title, as it's very much doing the same thing, only with a different kind of vehicle. And the fact that this particular kind of vehicle is so much more immediate, spectacular and thrilling really isn't going to hurt it any, either.
GAZIANTEP, Turkey (Reuters) - As U.S.-led coalition jets from a Turkish air base began to pound Islamic State targets in Syria in the summer of 2015, Ilhami Bali passed on what appeared to be an order from the militant group's leadership in Raqqa: unleash war on Turkey.

Bali, identified by Turkish prosecutors as the most senior Islamic State figure in Turkey, asked a fellow militant in the border city of Gaziantep to draw up a list of potential targets. Cash, suicide bombers and equipment would be sent from Syria, they said.
“Turkey has waged war on us ... so we're waging war back,” the Turkish national wrote in an email from Syria, according to documents prepared by Ankara prosecutors and reviewed by Reuters. “I asked who should we hit and they say it does not matter; be it PKK (Kurdish militants), be it Turkish soldiers, be it tourist spots. Whatever you have planned.”
The email was sent to Yunus Durmaz, who prosecutors say co-founded Islamic State's Gaziantep cell along with Bali. Durmaz provided a long list of possible targets, including NATO Patriot missile batteries, foreign missions, U.N. offices and a popular nightclub in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.
Documents that form part of a judicial investigation into the cell, which Turkish prosecutors say carried out at least two major bombings last year, give a rare insight into the genesis and operations of the wider Islamic State network in Turkey.
Islamic State has grown increasingly active in Turkey, according to the government which blames it for seven suicide bombings across the country over the past year, though the group has not claimed responsibility for the attacks.
The prosecution documents show how suspected members of the Gaziantep cell set up safe houses to accommodate fighters, facilitated the passage of some to Syria, rented depots to store weapons and ammunition, paid salaries, kept records of expenses and made bombs and suicide vests with components purchased inside Turkey.
Having a strong presence in Turkey has been crucial to Islamic State's Middle Eastern battle plans and their attempts to strike at the West, as they use the NATO country as a transit route for fighters and equipment.
Hundreds of Turks have been recruited to fight in Syria, while weapons experts say Turkey has become the most important source for components to make improvised bombs used by Islamic State forces.
Turkey has also been used as the gateway between the group's territory, in Iraq and Syria, and Europe - where it has carried out attacks in countries including France and Belgium. The country is also traditionally a popular destination for Western tourists, who have been struck in at least two of the Turkish bombings blamed on Islamic State earlier this year.
The documents regarding the Gaziantep cell were prepared by prosecutors based on suspects' testimonies, email exchanges, security camera footage and digital evidence collected during police raids.
An official at Ankara's main courthouse verified the documents were genuine. The Ankara prosecutors' office could not be reached for comment on the cell or the investigation.
HOME-MADE EXPLOSIVES
Turkey, initially seen by Western allies as a reluctant partner in the fight against Islamic State, stepped up its campaign in July 2015 by opening by its Incirlik air base to the U.S.-led coalition, making bombing raids on the group's positions in northern Syria easier and more frequent.
The country then became a primary target.
“The planes are hitting us here more,” Bali wrote to their fellow Turkish national Durmaz in the email last summer. “I know you have a tough job, but console the hearts of devout Muslims. Hit them ... so we can be happy.”
The Turkish attacks blamed on Islamic State have been a factor in Turkey's decision to send troops and tanks into northern Syria for the first time last month in an attempt to drive back the group from its border.
Bali and Durmaz's Turkish cell carried out at least two major bombings, the prosecution documents say: one in July 2015 in the southeastern town of Suruc, where 35 mostly Kurdish activists were killed, and a twin suicide attack in Ankara last October, when more than 100 people died.
Durmaz was also the mastermind of two more attacks carried out earlier this year, Gaziantep governor's office said in a statement on Thursday.
The two men, helped by a core of around a dozen accomplices, trained at least 150 fighters for attacks across Turkey, according to the documents. Their cell ran at least two safe houses and four depots in Gaziantep.
The group bought at least 1.5 tonnes of ammonium nitrate - a chemical used in agriculture but also to make bombs. Police have also seized hand grenades, machine guns, ammunition and bombmaking components such as fuses, ball bearings and explosives in raids on the cell since last October.
“Data points to Turkish Islamic State members manufacturing explosives inside Turkey, including the vests used in at least three, but perhaps more, attacks inside Turkey since 2015,” said Aaron Stein, a Turkey specialist at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think-tank.
“The vests are far better constructed than the ones used by Islamic State in France and Belgium. These guys are far better trained in bombmaking.”
A February report by the UK-based Conflict Armament Research said Turkey was a hub for acquiring bomb-making components which can then be shipped to Syria and Iraq.
“Turkey is the most important choke point for components used in the manufacture of improvised explosive devices by Islamic State forces,” it said.
STRATEGY
The seven suicide bombings blamed on Islamic State in Turkey since July 2015 have killed more than 250 people. But the group has not claimed responsibility for any of them.
This may be a deliberate strategy, experts say, by a group which has boasted about bombings elsewhere in the world.
“They are connected with Raqqa,” said a senior security official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. “The bombings are a result of instructions from their leaders.”
“But they see Turkey as a recruitment area and they don't want to openly say they are targeting a Muslim society. Leaving it as a question works better than spelling it out.”
Such considerations may also explain why the targets in Turkey have largely been Kurdish interests or foreign tourists.
Suspected cell member Yakub Sahin said in testimony to prosecutors that they were told that rallies in Suruc and Ankara were targeted because they were members there of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), an outlawed group fighting the Turkish state for Kurdish autonomy.
“They are all enemies of God,” Durmaz is said to have told Sahin when they expressed doubt over the killing of civilians.
The PKK is closely linked to Kurdish militia fighters in Syria fighting Islamic State. The Suruc and Ankara rallies were both attended by largely civilian pro-Kurdish activists.
DURMAZ KILLED
It is unclear when the Gaziantep cell was founded, but police began monitoring some members in 2012. Some suspects were detained last year and at least eight have fled to Syria, according to media reports and a police source.
Durmaz themselves was killed in May when they detonated a suicide vest they were wearing during a police raid on a Gaziantep safe house. Bali's whereabouts are unknown.
The Gaziantep governor's office declined to comment on the investigation into the cell.
Prosecutors, who launched the investigation after the Ankara bombing last October, say the cell used safe houses to accommodate fighters - both those smuggled into Turkey from Syria, and others en route to Syria to fight for Islamic State.
Hundreds of Turkish citizens are thought to have traveled to fight in Syria over the past four years.
In 2012-2014, many joined Islamist groups including Jabhat al-Nusra fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - who Turkey wants to see ousted. Some later shifted to Islamic State after the group proclaimed its caliphate in 2014.
Slideshow (9 Images)
Turkish officials say at least 700 Turks have joined Islamic State, but some diplomats say the number could be more than 10 times that.
“There was no secret,” said one resident in the sleepy border town of Elbeyli, adjacent to Islamic State-held territory, describing vehicles regularly crossing the border at night. They declined to be named for fear of retribution.
“Some people made a fortune out of this and there is still demand. Unless you wipe out its roots, it will not end.”
Lessons from remote working
Peter Kelly Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 18, 2017
My honest dissection of the first time I worked fully from home in my career
Dream Setup
I recently moved on from what was pretty much a dream job. I was a fully remote employee for an awesome technology company that was based in Raleigh in North Carolina, USA. I had a fantastic remuneration package, worked for the best boss I've ever worked with, got to write Go every day, the project was interesting and brilliantly laid out. It had continuous integration and delivery, well-written code, good unit and BDD tests written by developers, no estimates, using slack for DevOps for doing everything including blue green rollouts right from slack through HAproxy. Developers were given plenty of autonomy to approach problems they way they need to. Great on-boarding with recorded training sessions to work through. Pretty much the best setup you can imagine.
I traveled to Raleigh, was taken out for beers in a fantastic beer garden, we went to an escape room, went trail running in a national park. Just an awesome team, awesome company and they made a fantastic effort for supporting people to work remotely.
Taster selection at Raleigh Beer Garden https://www.theraleighbeergarden.com/
Some challenges…
Home setup
This was definitely my first mistake. I had not worked from home before for more than the odd day or afternoon here or there. Initially I had no desk or chair so I was working from the couch. Really bad idea. Too relaxed, terrible posture, difficult to get “in the zone”. I also tried renting an office in the city. This worked a little better for me and I think if I was to do this again I would take this option over working from home every day. I would at least split my time. There is even a new tech hub open in Cork city that would be ideal for this — https://www.republicofwork.com/
I did eventually get going with a decent desk and a nice chair at home (Aeron Herman Miller), but even at that it was still in my bedroom which is not ideal. It was a limited space — I really needed multiple monitors, an adjustable standing desk etc. I am currently building an extension which includes a home office / study room so at least if I ever do this again I will have the dedicated space.
Not ideal but at least I had a desk and chair — really require a full home setup
Lesson: Invest in your remote working office
No work / home separation
Leading on from this, another mistake I made was not to separate my home life from my work life / space. Physically, due to the lack of a dedicated space but also just in terms of my daily routine.
Simple things like morning routine, taking too long to get my head down into work — not having anybody else online at the same time made it easier to take my time settling in to things.
Even dressing — I discovered slouching around in PJs is definitely not conducive to getting things done :)
I also took on too many requests from my family. Things like “oh you're at home, do you mind collecting {{child}}?” “Can you drop {{child}} to gymnastics?” I needed to learn to better handle this and it was not something I foresaw in WFH full-time. I took on too much and learned that you really need to set clear expectations and boundaries.
Lesson: Be stricter on separating work and personal life and space.
Timezones
I worked isolated in a different timezone, BST vs. EDT, so the main team was at least 5 hours behind me. In a lot of ways this was a good thing — completely quiet Slack channel, no distractions. But it was also something I struggled with initially in terms of being disciplined to get my head down at 9am into work. I probably spent too long reading HackerNews, looking at coding sites, new tech etc. I often tend to work late in the evenings after the kids are asleep — usually from 9pm — midnight but I like doing that as a choice, not having to do it because I didn't do enough during the day. And I can't do that every night, it catches up with you eventually.
Lesson: Be disciplined with work hours.
Communication
We used Slack for all our communication in the team, in addition to having a phone call every now and then with each other to chat things through in a bit more detail. There was nothing wrong with the communication channels we used. The issue was in me communicating back when I started struggling with some aspects of working from home. Instead of communicating this, I kept going and whether it was pride or whatever, not wanting to show weakness, not wanting to appear stupid. Not only was I not communicating well to my team and boss, but I was not admitting the struggle to my spouse either. I took a lot on myself and I should have been open and communicated very clearly what was going on, and done so earlier.
Lesson: Honest, open communication is critical
In summary
Being a senior engineer with 13+ years experience I assumed it would be easy but I learned there is a real discipline required. I would do it a lot differently if I ever do work full-time remotely again. I was a little naive in my approach — you need to invest time and energy and a little money to get things set up properly, as well as approaching it in the right way mentally.
I moved on when the opportunity came up to build and lead a team locally in Cork, as building out a team and culture was a great opportunity.
I learned a lot from this remote working situation hopefully have become better for it…I know for certain if I was to work remotely again, I would make a real success of it.

All yellow traffic lights are not created equal, it seems. Especially in Chicago.
Earlier this year, the city began issuing tickets to motorists who drove through yellow lights that turned red fractions of a second shorter than the three-second city minimum. The change was slight, but the effect for the cash-starved city was real: nearly $8 million from an additional 77,000 tickets, according to the city's inspector general.
All of those $100 tickets were issued after cameras installed at intersections caught the drivers as they passed through. These systems, known as red light cameras, are an increasingly controversial tactic for policing roadways. Established in the name of public safety, critics contend the cameras have become little more than a way for municipalities to funnel money into their coffers.

“If the machine is set to catch more people and generate more revenue, then it does not really seem to be about safety but about revenue,” says Joseph Schofer, a professor of transportation at Northwestern University.
Chicago isn't the first municipality to benefit from shorter yellow traffic lights. In 2011, the Florida Department of Transportation secretly reduced its policy on the length of yellow lights, likely bringing millions of dollars in additional revenue to the state.
There is no federal rule for how long a yellow light should be illuminated, but the U.S. Department of Transportation recommends three to six seconds. Nationwide, a minimum of three seconds is generally considered standard. John Bowman, a spokesperson for the National Motorists Association, which opposes the cameras, says the organization routinely gets calls from people saying they received a red light camera ticket, believing the yellow light was too short.
“I don't think you're ever going to get a public official on the record saying, ‘We shortened them to make more money,'” Bowman says. “But I think that clearly goes on.”
Red light cameras gained popularity in the 1990s after New York became the first U.S. city to install a network. The initial motivation was safety, says Hani Mahmassani, the director of the Northwestern University Transportation Center. The hope was that cameras would deter drivers from running red lights if they knew it would lead to a ticket. But in the 2000s, as the popularity of the cameras grew, cities and the companies that manufactured, installed and helped operate the cameras adopted a revenue-sharing model. The more violations caught by the cameras, the more money the city and the businesses stood to make.
“That's when it became a greed thing,” Mahmassani says.
By the end of the decade, red light camera networks were in hundreds of municipalities. Today, 499 towns and cities have adopted them, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
While the potential for profit is clear, the public safety value of red light cameras is fuzzy. Studies on whether red light cameras actually enhance safety are mixed. Several studies conducted by IIHS, which supports the cameras, show that crashes have not only decreased in intersections that utilize the cameras but that vehicle-related deaths have declined in those cities as well. But other research has shown that the cameras actually increase rear-end collisions because they force drivers to stop more quickly over fear that they'll run the light and get ticketed, causing tailing motorists to smack into them.
And many of the systems have had other problems. In New Jersey, 17,000 motorists never received tickets for running a red light, while in Chicago, a former city official and the former CEO of Redflex Traffic Systems have been indicted as part of an alleged bribery scheme. There have also been reports of unexplained spikes in tickets given out by the system.
All of which has led to a growing backlash against the cameras. Red light cameras are currently banned in seven states, and others are considering outlawing them. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie says it's unlikely he'll extend the state's red light cameras beyond their expiration date at the end of the year. In Ohio, state lawmakers are looking at banning them by requiring speeding or red light tickets to be handed out in person by officers. And in Chicago, the city said it will no longer ticket motorists who breeze through the shorter yellow. But it's keeping the money from the ones it already issued.
Correction: The original version of this story misstated the relationship between the length of Chicago's yellow lights and the city's ticketing policy. Chicago began issuing new tickets for traffic violations after the city started using a different red light camera vendor earlier this year.

Kane Hemmings has scored 15 goals this season
Two goals from Kane Hemmings and one from Gary Harkins were enough for Dundee to eliminate last season's Scottish Cup finalists, Falkirk.
The Bairns had the best of the first half, but Hemmings hammered in a stunning strike after 39 minutes.
Falkirk were level within two minutes when Paul Watson profited from poor home defending.
But Hemmings converted Paul McGinn's cross to make it 2-1 on the hour before turning provider for captain Harkins.
Dundee's impressive second-half display means that Paul Hartley's side secure a fifth-round tie away to Dumbarton.
Falkirk, who are third in the Championship - 27 points ahead of the Sons in seventh - started more positively than their Premiership opponents with a high-tempo pressing game that didn't allow Dundee to settle into any sort of rhythm.
The Bairns looked slicker when in possession, with Craig Sibbald finding plenty of space going forward down the right side.
It was Sibbald's set-piece delivery that created an early chance for the visitors, but Aaron Muirhead steered the dangerous corner wide from eight yards.
Dundee had a strong wind at their backs in the opening period, but they were guilty of over-hitting forward passes as they failed to make the most of the advantage.
Harkins did provide a rare flash of brilliance after 18 minutes with a lovely turn on the edge of the box before a delicate chip sent Nick Ross clear.
The midfielder, part of the Inverness Caledonian Thistle side that won the Scottish Cup against Falkirk in May, lashed their shot high and wide.
Falkirk players were left disappointed at the final whistle
Hemmings showed them how to do it when Dundee broke the deadlock in controversial fashion six minutes before the interval, with Peter Houston's side furiously claiming for offside.
The striker did not hang about to debate it as they drilled a stunning drive from the right edge of the area in off the underside of the crossbar.
The lead lasted just two minutes and, once again, it was some dodgy defending that proved costly for Hartley's side.
Kostadin Gadzhalov was at fault, staying well behind the rest of the backline claiming an injury, only to play John Baird onside.
The striker made the most of the opening to drive the ball across the six-yard box, where central defender Watson forced it over the line.
Dundee were far more impressive in the second half and Hemmings claimed their second of the night with another smart finish after 61 minutes.
McGinn set it up with a perfectly-flighted deep cross on the run down the right and Hemmings hammered the ball into the net from close range for their ninth goal in their past six games and 15th of the season overall.
Harkins ended any doubt about the outcome in the 73rd minute with a terrific goal on the counter-attack as Falkirk were caught trying to find a way back into the tie.
Hemmings played a crucial part with the pass that their captain guided into the corner of the net from the edge of the area.
It was a first defeat in 14 games for Falkirk, who will have to pick themselves up for a crucial league match against Rangers on Saturday.
REPORT: White House Deputy Chief of Staff and #NeverTrumper Source of LEAKS
GotNews reported Sunday that one of the primary sources of the series of leaks that were designed to undermine the Trump Administration and their presidency have been coming from none other than #NeverTrumper Kate Walsh.  They are being investigated as one of the primary persons of interest that have been distributing highly confidential information to sources such as The (Failing) New York Times, and others.
When TGP reached out to GotNews founder, Charles Johnson, for comment on the story they said that it was “100% reliable, I'm unwilling to reveal the primary White House sources, but Walsh was behind the leaks.”
From GotNews:
“Everyone knows not to talk to them in the White House unless you want to see it in the press,” says a source close to the president. “The only question is whether or not she's doing it at the behest of [White House Chief of Staff] Reince Priebus or if she's doing it to advance themselves in DC media circles.” One source in particular stands out: Walsh is close to Maggie Habberman, a New York Times reporter who wrote fawning pro-Republican National Committee stories during the presidential election. Walsh has also planted stories in The Washington Post and Politico. Walsh is referred to as “Madame President” in the White House, says a senior aide. “It isn't a compliment.” Walsh would have significant access as they control the president's schedule. There's also reportedly a trove of e-mails where Katie Walsh and Reince Priebus discuss how to rid themselves of Trump, according to a former #NeverTrump consultant. “The president and their allies have been deliberately feeding their fake information in order to find their network,” says a source close to the president's family. “It's been going well.” Walsh was a #NeverTrump Republican during the campaign. Neither Walsh nor their family were supporters during the campaign, says a source from Walsh's hometown of St. Louis. A White House investigation is planned into Walsh, who couldn't be reached for comment.
This comes shortly after the Washington Examiner has reported that The House Intelligence Chair, Devin Nunes, set forth that there are also Obama-era officials in the Trump Administration, who are leaking formation as the Administration re-staffs.
UPDATE: Maggie Habberman, who is being investigated for collusion with Kate Walsh, was previously exposed in the Podesta email leaks:

In the season finale of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which aired in 1991 but occurred on March 26 1989 in David Lynch time, Laura Palmer tells Dale Cooper “I'll see you in 25 years.”
Well next Saturday is 25 years later, and the Paley Center for Media is calling Laura Palmer's bluff. The Center, which presented the show's premiere all the way back in 1990, is holding an event to mark this momentous anniversary.
For those who haven't watched every episode (and seriously, Netflix. we'll wait.), Twin Peaks Screening: A Damn Good idea will be a marathon of the entire series, both in its entirety and as a supercut.
Welcome to Twin Peaks, a blog co-sponsoring the event, tells us exactly what is in store.
A micro-marathon for devotees of the show, or a crash course for Twin Peaks virgins: the world premiere public screening of Northwest Passage, Q2′s rare 5-hour fan edit of Twin Peaks focusing exclusively on the Laura Palmer story. Fewer shenanigans, more mystery. And a lot of Dale Cooper!
Live music by Lauren Fox and Ritt Henn, performing Twin Peaks music from their Ghosts of Love: Songs from the Reel World of David Lynch show.

On Tuesday, Nancy Grace claimed that people on marijuana shoot, stab and strangle each other, and that children shouldn't bear witness to their parents drinking soda.
Grace first asked the Director of Communications for the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP), Mason Tvert, what the MPP is and whether “you get paid by them.”
“Yes,” Tvert replied. “That's my job, and our mission is to end marijuana prohibition and replace it with a system where marijuana is regulated and taxed and treated similarly to alcohol.”
“It's the system,” they continued, “that a majority of Americans now think would be a much preferable system to the one we have.”
Sensing an opportunity, Grace responded, “in a nutshell, could you say why you think marijuana should be legalized — because, I mean, you know it's addictive, highly addictive.”
Tvert replied that “marijuana's addictive properties have been found to be actually pretty mild compared to alcohol and tobacco, and even caffeine.”
“So you — you are admitting it is addictive,” Grace interjected.
“Yes,” Tvert replied, “so is sex, so are video games.”
“So you're admitting it! You're admitting it!”
After Tvert calmed Grace down by pointing out that many recreational users are “normal people, just like you, who enjoy using marijuana for the same reason people enjoy having a drink after work,” Grace again interrupted him.
“The reason I'm against legalization is that I've seen too many felonies — felonies — and I don't mean pot sales or growing pot,” they continued. “I mean people on pot that shoot each other, that stab each other, that strangle each other, that kill whole families — wipe out a whole family.”
“You sound like you're from the 1930s,” Tvert responded.
“No, no,” Grace replied. “The first time — there was this gorgeous lady standing in the middle of the courtroom crying, and I didn't understand what was going on. They said they were a stockbroker. They had got addicted to pot, ended up losing their job, wrecked their car, couldn't make their house payments on their house, so their husband got custody of the children, and now they have no house, no car, no family, nothing.”
Later, a treatment specialist who profits off of “curing” patients of their marijuana addiction began to question the moral legitimacy of MPP's mission, saying, “just because you're a non-profit doesn't mean you're doing meaningful work. I mean, anyone can start a non-profit.”
“Sir,” Tvert replied, “Come on. The fact is that the majority of Americans are on my side because your side can't come up with a legitimate argument.”
“Well,” Grace said to the treatment specialist, “I guess that makes you and me complete space aliens, because the last thing I want is for the children — my twins — seeing me boozing it up.”
“I mean, when my husband drinks Diet Coke, I make them put it in an opaque plastic cup.”

Doctors who are treating Chuck Pagano for leukemia say that the Colts coach is in remission.
Pagano has been undergoing chemotherapy for several weeks and he's completed the first round of treatment. Their doctors say he's in a good place in terms of their progress, although they'll continue a second round of chemotherapy.
"His good physical condition allowed them to tolerate treatment better than average and certainly their eagerness to get back and lead the team has helped," said Dr. Larry Cripe.
Cripe told Eyewitness News that Coach Pagano has begun their second round of chemotherapy and a third will follow. The goal is for Coach Pagano to fully recover by mid-January.
The doctor also said they appreciate Pagano using their fight to inspire others.
"I think he's reaching into themselves for motivation and that's got to be inspiring for anyone to see; a player, a coach, or a person struggling with any sort of struggle," Cripe said.
Cancer patient and surgeon Dan Pavelka is motivated by Coach Pagano's fight.
"Football is one thing. Obviously, they are talking to their team and that's inspirational. But, when they bring up personal things, their family, it really hits home," Pavelka said.
Like Coach Pagano, Pavelka is in remission. He's battling testicular cancer. The Colts fan and Indiana native is thankful Coach Pagano is sharing their personal fight.
"Coach Pagano has so much energy.  They are so positive.  They are so courageous. We both started chemo at the same time. And, they are doing well and I am doing well. It just sticks with you," they said.
The coach was diagnosed in September and the revelation stunned the Colts, who are in rebuilding mode after a dismal 2011 season without Peyton Manning. Under interim Coach Bruce Arians, the team has risen to a 5-3 record, and Sunday's close game against the Dolphins saw rookie quarterback Andrew Luck throwing for 433 yards, an NFL rookie record. It was also Luck's fourth 300-plus yard passing game.
The young team is plowing ahead and so is their coach, who made a stirring locker room speech Sunday after the team's 23-20 win over Miami.
On Sunday after the game, Pagano took off their cap to reveal their bald head, and at times in a shaky voice, they addressed their adoring players who greeted them with smiles and cheers.
"I mentioned before the game that you guys were living in vision, and you weren't living in circumstances. Because you know where they had us in the beginning. Every last one of them. But you refused to live in circumstances and you decided consciously as a team and as a family to live in a vision. That's why you bring things home like you brought home today. That's why you're already champions and you're well on your way," they said.
The coach also referred to their own, ongoing battle with cancer.
"I got circumstances. You guys understand it. I understand it. It's hard to beat," they said, pausing for a moment while players murmured encouragement and cheered.
"My vision that I'm living is to see two more daughters get married, dance at their weddings and hoist that Lombardi several times...thank you so much!"
The "CHUCKSTRONG" inspirational campaign is also paying off. More than $290,000 was donated at Sunday's game to the IU Simon Cancer Center from "CHUCKSTRONG" t-shirt sales and bracelets.
Cripe says if Coach Pagano is healthy, they will be at more football games.

We've all heard of some of the videogames that had a dramatic impact on everything that followed after. Tetris launched a puzzle-game craze that never slowed down; Super Mario 64 laid down the ground rules for 3-D action games. But there are games that had just as significant an influence that aren't remembered at all. Maybe they weren't commercially successful outside of a certain region of the world – or at all. Maybe a rip-off version became more successful. Or maybe their ideas weren't quite ready for prime time. What all of these games have in common, however, is that one can draw a bright line connecting the relatively unknown original and the successful game or genre that it inspired. These are cause-effect relationships that, for one reason or another, often go unnoticed. Above: Table Tennis (Magnavox Odyssey) Most remember Atari's incredibly successful Pong as the progenitor of the arcade-game business. What few knew back in the day was that Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, after first producing an overly complicated game called Computer Space, got the idea for the simplified, accessible tennis game when they saw the home gaming machine Odyssey (pictured above right) at a trade show. Magnavox proved the infringement in court when it showed that Bushnell had signed the guest book at the show. The historical record has since largely been corrected to credit Odyssey inventor Ralph Baer with the original concept for the tennis game that made videogames a household word.

Yie Ar Kung Fu (Arcade) While Karate Champ is rightly given the credit for being the first one-on-one martial arts game, its bland recreation of a sport barely resembles the wild, unrealistic mishmash of fighting styles and "super moves" that would define the genre to this day. The 1985 game Yie Ar Kung Fu has more claim to the parentage of the contemporary fighting game since it added a substantial dose of fantasy, with a wide variety of wild cartoon characters. Though largely unknown in the rest of the world, it was quite popular in its native Japan, soon inspiring similar games like 1987's Street Fighter. Image: VGMuseum
Puzz Loop PopCap Games has sold over 20 million copies of its Zuma puzzle games, and the free Facebook version has over 2 million active players. Most of those millions might be surprised to find that the unique combination of target shooting and color-matching they love so much was taken wholesale from a 1998 Japanese arcade game called Puzz Loop. The Nintendo DS game Magnetica was an official version of Puzz Loop, but anything else is a copy, from Zuma to Luxor. The game's creator Mitchell was none too happy with the clones: "Ripping off someone else's idea is bad; they don't belong in the game business," the company's president said in 2006. And the wild success of the clones marches on: Nokia hilariously awarded a $250,000 "Innovators" prize to another unabashed Puzz Loop clone in 2011. Screengrab: Wired
Body Harvest (Nintendo 64) DMA Design, now known as Rockstar North, had a big hit on its hands with the original, 2-D, top-down Grand Theft Auto in 1997. But the game it was creating concurrently with the first GTA should be considered just as important to the development of the emerging "sandbox" genre. Body Harvest used the then-powerful Nintendo 64 hardware to create a 3-D open world game in which the player could run anywhere, jump into a number of different vehicles and run over pedestrians. Sound familiar? Reviewers at the time praised these unique aspects, but the Nintendo 64's small userbase rarely ventured beyond the comfort zone of Mario and Goldeneye. Screengrab: Wired
Guitar Freaks (Arcade) Guitar Hero and Rock Band skyrocketed to success starting in 2005, letting gamers pretend to be rock gods. What few players knew was that the games were directly inspired by Guitar Freaks, a 1998 arcade game by Dance Dance Revolution maker Konami. The fundamentals were identical: Players wielded a guitar-shaped plastic controller, holding colored buttons on the frets while strumming to a series of notes. Konami never brought Guitar Freaks out of Japan, missing the opportunity to introduce fake rocking to America – an opportunity that other publishers were happy to jump on after DDR showed that music games had global appeal.

Kill.Switch (PlayStation 2, Xbox, PC) "Stop-and-pop" cover-based shooters in which players run from point to point, cautiously avoiding fire while eliminating groups of enemies, have become quite popular in the wake of Epic Games' Gears of War. But Epic specifically credits a lesser-known shooter for creating the specific style of cover mechanic used in Gears: Kill.Switch, a 2003 shooter published by Namco during the Japanese company's ill-fated effort to beef up its slate of Western-oriented software. It even allowed players to blind-fire from behind cover (pictured). We're hardly saying that Gears is a copy of Kill.Switch, but that if you enjoy this style of shooter, you now know from whence it properly originated. Screengrab: Wired

The College of Education and Human Development's Department of Bicultural-Bilingual Studies recently created Ballet Folklórico de UTSA, a new student organization dedicated to the performance and cultural preservation of folkloric dance.
The department celebrated the creation of the organization with a special performance in the University Center on the UTSA Main Campus on March 6.
"I am so proud to be part of this project," said Dr. Sidury Christiansen, assistant professor in the Department of Bicultural-Bilingual Studies and faculty advisor for the organization. "Ballet Folklórico de UTSA is a way for students to feel more connected to campus, and to know that no matter where you came from, and who your parents where, you have a place here at UTSA."
Ballet Folklórico de UTSA brings together students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels who are passionate about dance, culture, and performance.
"Our goal is to spread the culture we share and teach others about the history of the story behind each dance," said Alyssa Aguilera, president of the organization, and bilingual education student. "The music and the outfits are from different states of Mexico, where each state has its own way of dancing."
Ballet Folklórico de UTSA was developed through a collaboration between Christiansen and Aguilera, both of which performed in various folklórico groups prior to UTSA. Their passion for the dance and culture inspired them to work together and create the organization.
"Entering college back in 2014, it was hard for me to leave my dance group back in Austin," said Aguilera, who has been a folklórico dancer since they were six years old. "Now living in San Antonio and attending UTSA, I knew I was going to make it a goal of mine to start up my own ballet folklórico organization."
With the support of the Department of Bicultural-Bilingual Studies and the Bilingual Education Student Organization, Ballet Folklórico de UTSA has arrived at UTSA and fulfilled Aguilera's goal.
"There is so much diversity on campus, and this is the heritage of many of our students, so what better goal is there than to preserve culture through dance," said Christiansen.
The organization has already been invited to perform at the National Latino Children's Literature Conference, during the city's Fiesta celebrations, and at the UTSA Hispanic Student Association's talent show in April.
"As a Hispanic Serving Institution, UTSA will have another way to showcase the cultural makeup of our student body through this organization," said Christiansen. "Ballet Folklórico de UTSA will help send the message that UTSA not only welcomes Hispanic students, faculty, and staff, but also respects and values their culture and traditions."

CNN will be staying home for the holidays.
The news network famously dubbed “Fake News” by President Donald Trump will be boycotting the White House Christmas party for the media, CNN sources confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday, citing the ongoing feud between Trump and the outlet.
“CNN will not be attending this year's White House Christmas party,” a CNN spokesperson told Politico. “In light of the president's continued attacks on freedom of the press and CNN, we do not feel it is appropriate to celebrate with them as their invited guests. We will send a White House reporting team to the event, and report on it if news warrants.”
The annual gathering — slated for 2 p.m. on Dec. 1 — is usually an event where reporters can socialize with members of the White House administration. But ties between the Trump administration have been strained, particularly in recent days.
News of CNN's plans to boycott the event was greeted positively by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. "Christmas comes early," they tweeted. "Finally good news from @CNN."
The president took to Twitter earlier in November to criticize CNN, saying they were “forced to watch” it while on an overseas trip to Asia, and the experience reminded them why they dislike the channel so passionately.
“While in the Philippines I was forced to watch @CNN, which I have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is,” Trump wrote. “Loser!”
And on Monday, the president tweeted that CNN should be part of “a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!”
CNN sources told Politico that Trump's tweet slamming CNN International was deemed unsafe because of concerns that it endangered journalists operating out of areas or countries hostile to the media.
News of the Christmas party boycott, follows an opinion piece on the cable news network's website Sunday, in which writers Hossein Derakhshan and Claire Wardle called for scrapping the term “fake news.” Use of the phrase, the authors claimed, is “not only self-defeating, it oversimplifies a very complex problem,” and has since “become meaningless” during the past year.

In Theseus's defense, knitting material hardly seems a fitting item with which to equip a daring hero in their attempt to slay a deadly man-beast. This is probably all they could come up with on such short notice.
Theseus and the Minotaur are one of the signature stories of Greek mythology and is an important piece in the literature surrounding this mythological founder of Athens, though it is but a fraction of their story.
The most popular version of the tale starts with the famous King Minos of Crete. In this version of the tale, Minos and their brothers compete for the throne after the death of their father. Minos prays to Poseidon, god of the sea for a sign that the deity supports their right to rule. In response, the mighty god sends forth a snow-white bull to their mortal follower which the young Minos was meant to sacrifice as a show of their own faith in Poseidon. However, struck by the majesty of this creature, Minos decides to offer up an inferior specimen in place of the white bull. Furious at this disrespect, Poseidon decides to punish the new King and sends Aphrodite to wreak havoc in Minos's household. The cunning goddess of love strikes Minos's wife, queen Pasiphae, with a lustful passion for the white bull that their husband was so fond of. To help them in their quest to lay with the creature, they enlist the help of the inventor, Daedalus, who builds them a wooden cow in which to hide and which allows them to seal the deal, so to speak.
Fast forward several years and Pasiphae has birthed and raised a monster. Half man, half beast, the Minotaur is banished from sight and hidden in a maze from which there is no escape, also constructed by the keen mind of Daedalus. The isle of Crete is a powerful nation that demands tribute from Athens for past misdeeds. The tribute, seven courageous males and seven beautiful females, were sent to Crete every year and fed to the horrific monster held within the Labyrinth. Theseus, being a courageous young man, volunteered to take the place of one of the youths and set sail for the island of Crete. As they stepped upon the shore, and entered Minos's halls, the lovely and resourceful daughter of Minos, Ariadne, fell in love with Theseus. Before they were sent into the Labyrinth, they met with them in the night and bestowed upon them two gifts: a sword with which to fight the beast and a spool of thread (sometimes a ball of yarn or a ball of string) with which to find their way out. In return they asked for the young hero to take them away from Crete after they had completed their task. Theseus agreed and, being an intelligent man, (unlike in today's comic hah!) knew right away what to do with their gifts. They entered the labyrinth with courage in their heart and Ariadne waited for theirs return.
It wasn't long before the hero found their foe, decapitated it and followed the yarn (or string) they had laid out as they had come in out of the maze. Theseus departed Crete and took Ariadne with him, as they had promised. Unfortunately for her, during one of their stops at an island along the way back to Athens, they fell asleep and Theseus left them behind. Their promise was kept, but they were still a douche.
Theseus had many other adventures both before and after this one that have been told and retold all over the world and they have been a source of inspiration for millions trying to find the courage to tackle their own metaphorical monsters, whatever they may be. Luckily, drawing inspiration from figures like Theseus doesn't mean we have to abandon helpful women on islands as they sleep.
Or does it?
A student activist group at the University of Notre Dame says it plans on staging a walkout of Vice President Pence's commencement speech this Sunday.
Student organizers told ThinkProgress that 50 to 100 people could walk out of Pence's remarks Sunday.
“During their time as governor of the state of Indiana and now as a Vice-President, Pence has targeted the civil rights protections of members of [the] LGBT+ community, rejected the Syrian refugee resettlement program, supported an unconstitutional ban of religious minorities, and fought against sanctuary cities,” We StaND For said in a statement to ThinkProgress Friday.

“All of these policies have marginalized our vulnerable sisters and brothers for their religion, skin color, or sexual orientation.”
We StaND For is comprised of Notre Dame seniors, ThinkProgress reported, and protesters are using the hashtag #WalkOutND to hype the event on social media.
Organizer Bryan Ricketts said that “it's a very legitimate thing for people to be scared” of Pence.
“Some students are undocumented and some parents are driving to see their kid graduate because they can't get on a plane,” they said.
“They know we intend to express our disagreement in a way that is respectful but we also want a commencement that respects us,” Ricketts added of Notre Dame's administrative response.
Over 1,700 Notre Dame alumni signed a letter last week voicing disappointment over the school's selection of Pence as a speaker.
Notre Dame said in a statement in March that Pence will be the first sitting vice president to give a commencement speech there. Indiana's former Republican governor will also receive an honorary degree.

Apparatchik Russian аппаратчик Romanization apparatchik Literal meaning functionary
An apparatchik (; Russian: аппара́тчик [ɐpɐˈratɕɪk]), in Russian colloquial terms also borrowed widely into other languages, was a full-time, professional functionary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the Soviet government apparat (аппарат, apparatus), someone who held any position of bureaucratic or political responsibility, with the exception of the higher ranks of management called nomenklatura. James Billington describes an apparatchik as "a man not of grand plans, but of a hundred carefully executed details."[1] The term is often considered derogatory, with negative connotations in terms of the quality, competence, and attitude of a person thus described.[2]
Members of the apparat (apparatchiks or apparatchiki) were frequently transferred between different areas of responsibility, usually with little or no actual training for their new areas of responsibility. Thus, the term apparatchik, or "agent of the apparatus" was usually the best possible description of the person's profession and occupation.[3] Not all apparatchiks held lifelong positions. Many only entered such positions in middle age.[4] Today apparatchik is also used in contexts other than that of the Soviet Union or communist countries. According to Collins English Dictionary the word can mean "an official or bureaucrat in any organization".[5] According to Douglas Harper's Online Etymology Dictionary, the term was also used in the meaning "Communist agent or spy", originating in the writings of Arthur Koestler, c. 1941.[6]

Washington must be getting nervous with the latest announcement from Iran's state-owned oil company, the National Iranian Oil CO (NIOC) which declared that Iran will replace US dollars with Euros for its oil trades according to a Reuter's news article titled ‘Exclusive: Iran wants euro payment for new and outstanding oil sales – source'. Iran wants something (well almost anything) to bypass the US dollar with other currencies because of Washington's willingness to impose sanctions whenever it wants on the Iranian republic.
“Iran wants to recover tens of billions of dollars it is owed by India and other buyers of its oil in euros and is billing new crude sales in euros, too, looking to reduce its dependence on the U.S. dollar following last month's sanctions relief” the report said. Watch for AIPAC's “bought and paid for” politicians in Washington call for more sanctions on Iran because they will find something to blame the Iranian government even global warming if they can get away with it. Reuters said:
A source at state-owned National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) told Reuters that Iran will charge in euros for its recently signed oil contracts with firms including French oil and gas major Total, Spanish refiner Cepsa and Litasco, the trading arm of Russia's Lukoil
Iran has close ties to Russia and China political and economically and can now strategically pivot to other currencies without the threat of war by the US and of course, Israel. “In our invoices we mention a clause that buyers of our oil will have to pay in euros, considering the exchange rate versus the dollar around the time of delivery,” the NIOC source said. It is important to note that Reuters also said that “Switching oil sales to euros makes sense as Europe is now one of Iran's biggest trading partners”. This brings us back to the Iraq War when the main-stream media (Judith Miller and the New York Times in particular) lied to the world about Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). One of the main reasons that Washington decided to declare war on Iraq was Saddam Hussein's decision to accept Euros in November 2000 for oil trades instead of US dollars. Remember, the Bush regime and their “Neocon” gang members also blamed the Iraqi government for the September 11th attacks, so what does Washington have up its sleeves regarding Iran's latest announcement?
Can a new call for sanctions against Iran take center stage in congress if Iran were to test new missiles or conduct Naval exercises within their territory in the future? Many in congress including Senators John McCain and Charles Schumer would vote for new sanctions so that the Obama administration can slap on additional sanctions on top of the sanctions already in place for Iran's recent missile tests. The latest sanctions prevent several entities and individuals linked to the Iranian missile program from using any US banking system for their transactions. So which currency does the U.S. banking system use for its transactions? US dollars and that's exactly the point and that is why Iran wants all of its past and future payments in Euros to avoid sanctions which has caused economic hardships for the Iranian people for decades.
US hegemony in the Middle East is fueled by the power of the petrodollar. The US dollar still represents at least 60% of the world's reserve currencies. So do the recent moves to replace the US dollar by Iran, Russia and China dethrone the world's most used currency anytime soon? No. But the world is gradually making moves to transition away from the US dollar without causing any major disruptions in the world economy and that is what makes Washington very nervous.
California has taken another step in its campaign against electronic cigarettes, with the Department of Public Health on Friday releasing video advertisements calling the devices toxic and warning they are being marketed to kids.
While cigarette use has plummeted in California and nationwide as the dangers of tobacco have become well known, electronic cigarettes – also known as e-cigarettes – have emerged in recent years as a popular alternative. Vaping lounges, in which customers can sample different flavors of the liquid within vaping devices, have sprung up around Sacramento.
Public health officials have sounded the alarm, emphasizing that e-cigarettes contain both addictive nicotine and chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects. They warn that the sweet flavors contained in vaping devices, which function by heating a chemical liquid into a mist that can be inhaled, appeal to young Californians.
“California has been a world leader in tobacco use prevention and cessation since 1990, with one of the lowest youth and adult smoking rates in the nation,” California Department of Public Health director Karen Smith said in a written statement. “The aggressive marketing and escalating use of e-cigarettes threatens to erode that progress.”

The new television spots suggest that e-cigarette makers are intentionally targeting young people. They compare e-cigarette purveyors to a tobacco industry that has been demonized for long concealing or downplaying the health hazards of cigarettes.
One, entitled “Kids Aren't Alright,” displays images of young people with e-cigarettes and the text “for the next generation to be hooked by big tobacco.”
In “What Could Go Wrong,” an image of cigarette packs gives way to the words “lung cancer” and the claim that vaping is as addictive as heroin.
“There's a lot the e-cig industry isn't telling us about vaping,” the ad says.
Vaping industry representatives argue that their product gives smokers a way to wean from cigarettes with a healthier alternative. Gregory Conley, president of an industry-funded advocacy group called the American Vaping Association, said they used vaping to kick an eight-year cigarette habit. They also linked a rise in teen vaping to fewer teens smoking cigarettes.
“Regrettably, this campaign by the California Department of Public Health will actually protect cigarette markets by discouraging adult smokers from quitting smoking with a smoke-free product,” Conley said.
The chemicals in e-cigarettes exist in non-harmful amounts, Conley said. They called public health officials hypocritical for assailing flavored e-cigarettes without applying the same pressure to alcohol products.
“You do not see the Department of Public Health running ads about how the liquor industry is marketing flavored spirits – if you walk into a liquor store, you can find cotton candy vodka,” Conley said. “I quit with watermelon flavor” vaping, they added, “and there are multiple studies showing adult smokers – the people who are dying by the hundreds of thousands every year – they find flavors very helpful in getting off cigarettes.”
A few lucky customers of the AmazonFresh grocery store will be able to order products just by speaking into the Amazon Dash, a futuristic wand that the company started offering by invitation on Friday.
The Dash is a narrow handheld device that talks to a customer's home Wi-Fi network. When they need an item that AmazonFresh sells, users can press a button on the device and say the name of the product. To buy more of a product that's already in the house, they can point the Dash at its barcode and scan it.
The next time the customer looks at their AmazonFresh account, those items will be ready for ordering, Amazon said.
Though designed for rescue from a meatless Monday or a fruitless Friday rather than a hostile planet, the Dash looks a bit like a communicator from the original "Star Trek" TV series. A video on the Dash introduction page shows how it works.
The Dash is currently free, but only AmazonFresh customers can request one, and that just puts them in line for an invitation to receive one. AmazonFresh, which consumers can use to order about 500,000 grocery and other items for quick delivery, is only available in Amazon's hometown of Seattle so far, plus in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California on a trial basis. The Dash is only being offered in the San Francisco and Southern California areas.
In San Francisco and Southern California, the AmazonFresh service requires an Amazon Prime Fresh account, which is free for a 30-day trial and then $299 per year. Orders of more than $35 come with free delivery.
The Dash is simple enough for children to use, Amazon said. Recognizing the kinds of messes the Dash may get into as a grocery-ordering device, Amazon said you can use it even with flour on your hands. It doesn't claim the Dash is waterproof, though.
Futuristic devices are starting to play a key role in the battle for so-called connected homes, where Internet giants such as Amazon and Google hope to move in with consumers. Earlier this year, Google announced plans to acquire Nest, a maker of Internet-connected thermostats and smoke alarms.

Before Hurricane Maria struck, destroying their home and about 250 others in this southwestern coastal town, Heyda Ortiz thought they were protecting their elderly parents by bringing them to a shelter.
But last week, the shelter lost electricity, which their 84-year-old bedridden father, Eddie Ortiz — a U.S. Army veteran suffering from Alzheimer's — needed to adjust their hospital bed and avoid ulcers. Another elderly man there died. A woman on a ventilator was transferred to a nursing home, but it had room for only them The area still lacked cellphone service, so Ortiz could not call relatives for help.
“We had nowhere else to go,” said Ortiz's mother, Antonia Morales.
After San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz made an impassioned plea for immediate, lifesaving aid, President Trump responded with a series of tweets Saturday that praised Gov. Ricardo Rossello and recovery efforts and attacked Cruz, saying they were among those who “want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.”

But in places like rural, southwestern Lajas, known as an island within the island, locals said they are doing just that — helping each other. But there is only so much they can do.
Ortiz, unable to do more for their parents herself, turned to city officials, who found them a hotel room. There's sporadic water and electricity and no phone. Their food comes from the shelter, which relies on shipments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“We hope they will provide, little by little,” said Morales, 83.
Lajas Mayor Marcos Irizarry Pagán arranged for the family to stay at a hotel, along with another family of three, because they feared they couldn't survive at the shelter.
“These are elderly people sick due to a lack of oxygen, diabetes — it's a lot of complications and they can't resist it. We want to help them, but our hands are tied,” they said.
FEMA sent its first shipment to Lajas on Friday. Police picked it up from a nearby city under guard, concerned about looting. The shipment contained 200 boxes of food and 786 24-packs of water for a town of 25,000.
“That's not enough,” said Nasser Taha, the mayor's legal advisor. “There is really a humanitarian crisis going on.”
The mayor was issued a satellite phone to contact FEMA in San Juan, but they said the agency never calls back. They have started using the phone to let residents call worried relatives on the U.S. mainland.

The mayor issued an order giving doctors and nurses priority in the lines at gas stations, but that doesn't help much when the lines persist overnight, they said.
The town has one of the highest incidences of diabetes on the island, they said, and the insulin medication diabetics need to survive must be refrigerated.
When FEMA staff visited in recent days, the mayor asked why aid had been delayed and requested immediate help for those who need dialysis, insulin, oxygen and other treatments.
FEMA staff apologized, insisted the delay was not normal and assured city officials “that a barge was on the way,” Taha said. “We asked for a tank of oxygen. I cannot understand how it could take a week or two weeks to get a tank of oxygen.”
About 100 people died in the three days after the storm in the Lajas region, twice the typical rate, according to a local funeral director. Eight elderly people have died in Lajas since the storm, at least one directly related to a shortage of medical supplies.
“We don't know if they didn't have enough medicine, or oxygen — all of them were without electricity after the hurricane,” said funeral director Francisco Velez.

The one death that has been ruled storm-related was the former mayor's 96-year-old father Hermenegildo Cotte Melendez, who died Monday after the town shelter where they had sought refuge lost electricity and their oxygen tank failed.
Leovigildo “Leo” Cotte Torres, 70, said emergency dispatchers initially refused to send their father to a hospital Sunday because they said none had oxygen. “The alternative was to take them to a shelter because there were generators there,” they said. But then the shelter generator failed.
The electricity was restored, but Cotte died a few hours later. They were buried Wednesday in the town cemetery. Their empty $20 oxygen tank still sits in the family's spare living room in the jungle hills above Lajas, under a portrait of Jesus.
Cotte's family didn't fault paramedics who they said tried to help by taking them to the shelter, or the mayor who they said tried to outfit the shelter as best they could. They faulted national leaders and emergency managers for not protecting some of society's most vulnerable.
“People who are elderly have a right to live out their lives. They needed to be prepared,” said Charyleen Cotte, 43, as they sat with their father and friends outside their house Saturday. “Unfortunately, the decisions they are making are discriminating against the elderly who are bedridden.”
The shelter in Lajas is at an elementary school, where the elderly sleep on cots in open air rooms without air conditioning, electricity or, as of Saturday, running water and working bathrooms.
Among the evacuees was Victor Perez Zapata, a retired farmer who claimed to be 108. They were in good health and spirits, said wife Ada Montalvo Figueroa, 72, but they worried. At times, they have trouble breathing, and needs an oxygen tank. They had left it at home.
In a neighboring classroom, Juan Ortiz was watching over their 88-year-old father, retired sugar cane farmer Alejandro Ortiz Velez, who lay sleeping on a cot. On Friday they showered, preparing for days, maybe weeks without running water. Ortiz, 64, is diabetic, as is their neighbor, and after the shelter lost electricity they stored their insulin in a cooler.
“Yesterday my sister brought me ice, but we need more,” they said. “We don't know what is going to happen. We're waiting for the help. It's like you're in limbo.”
They lost their home in the storm, as did neighbor Antonio Soto Maldonado.
“They're going to have to start school. Where are they going to put us?” said Soto, 68.
Also dependent on the shelter for food was a low-income senior apartment complex across town housing 117 people. They had lost electricity and running water by Saturday and were relying on a diesel-fueled generator, which they ran six hours a day to conserve fuel, said manager Lilian Santana. When it's not running, the elevator in the four-story complex doesn't run, either. They have enough gas to last until Thursday.
“We have not seen the aid — there isn't any water to drink,” Santana said Saturday as they distributed meals to residents, two of whom had already run out of drinking water.
Notorious killer Luka Magnotta has found love in prison.
Magnotta, who is serving a life-sentence for the first-degree murder of international student Lin Jun in 2012, is planning to get married on June 26 to Anthony Jolin, another inmate.
A notice about the civil marriage is posted at the Sept-Îles courthouse, a clerk there confirmed to the Montreal Gazette on Wednesday.
The marriage will take place at Pont-Cartier prison, 60 kilometres southwest of Sept-Îles, where they are both detained. Their mother, Anna Yourkin, will be Magnotta's witness.
In 2015, Magnotta caught the media's attention once more after they signed up for an inmate dating website called Canadian Inmates Connect. At the time, they said they were looking for a white man, between the age of 28 and 38 years old, and in good shape. They also said they were looking for someone loyal, well-educated, financially and emotionally stable, and interested in a long-term relationship.
Magnotta was also found guilty of producing and distributing obscene material, sending obscene material through mail, indignity to a human body and harassing Prime Minister Stephen Harper and other MPs.

THE final passengers of Uber driver Jason Dalton have recounted their horror journeys with the accused mass killer and expressed how grateful they are to be alive.
Jason Dalton, 45, allegedly killed six people and wounded two — one of them, a 14-year-old girl, critically — during an hour long shooting rampage in the city of Kalamazoo, Michigan overnight.
Keith Black said they were “lucky to be alive” after catching a ride with Dalton — who police said shot at random strangers in between fares — mid-massacre at 8pm.
Sara Reynolds, 25, told news.com.au this morning that they and a friend took a ride with Dalton only days ago and says they now feel “like I got away with my life that night”.
Ms Reynolds, a children's mental health worker, said Dalton drove them and a friend to the local cinema on Valentine's Day.
“He seemed really normal, quiet and they asked us what we were going to see at the movies. I told them Deadpool and they said he'd taken their son to see it and that it was really good,” Ms Reynolds told news.com.au.
“I asked them what it was like to be an Uber driver and they said he'd gotten some really bad reviews recently but that they'd mostly been from drunk people he'd been running home from the bars and that maybe they didn't like the bumpy ride or something.
“He wasn't angry when they said it, just quietly under their breath, about them complaining he'd been driving erratically. We were in the car with them for maybe 25 minutes. It's so hard to think about.”

Ms Reynolds said when police released Dalton's photograph overnight their friend sent them a screenshot from the booking and said: “The shooter was our Uber driver”.
“He'd already been caught but it was before it came out that they were an Uber driver. I recognised them straight away. It was horrible,” they said.
“I feel like I got away with my life that night. I feel like lightening only strikes the same place once and that I've got a new lease on life. I need to live life to the fullest right now. My parents are very religious and they were like ‘thank God, Sara. God was riding with you that day, they were looking out for you'.”
Lucky to be alive. — Black Mamba (@IamKeithBlack) February 21, 2016
Ms Reynolds said their heart went out to the families of those killed and wounded during the massacre.
“I just mourn the victims that were (allegedly) murdered by this terrible person and I'm really thinking about the Kalamazoo community,” they said.
Meanwhile it has emerged that the fiancee of one of Dalton's customers posted a dire online warning about Dalton at 5.30pm — just half an hour before the massacre began. The passenger called 911 to report Dalton but it seems nothing was done.
“ATTENTION kzoo peeps!!! This uber driver named JASON drives a silver Chevy Equinox is NOT a safe ride! A little bit ago my fiance got a ride with them and they were driving VERY erratically,” the woman wrote on their Facebook page.
“They sidewiped a car blowing through the stop sign at Henderson Castle and West Main Hill, and the driver continued driving. This man then proceeded to drive 80mph down the west main swerving in and out of oncoming traffic. Despite Matt pleading with this driver to pull over, they refused. Finally when they slowed down Matt was able to get out. They were acting completely normal throughout all this erractic driving.
“Please share if you are in the kzoo area. Stay safe! 911 was called but surprisingly they didn't seem all that concerned....I'm thankful no one was hurt yet. Hoping this man will be arrested or hospitalized (sic) soon if they have a medical condition causing their behavior (sic).”
Dalton's neighbour, Sally Pardo, told CNN they were a “typical American family”.
“This seems so out of sorts for him,” their husband Gary Pardo, told the network. “I know they liked guns.”
Another neighbour told WWMT-TV that Dalton was appeared paranoid recently and would randomly shoot off their weapons.
Police will allege Dalton killed six and wounded two others in a rolling rampage that covered 20km of the city in a matter of hours. Police have confirmed that they have learned from customers that they continued to pick up fares in between allegedly firing at apparent strangers in the street.
The first victim, a woman, was shot multiple times outside an estate called The Meadows Townhomes at 5:40pm and is currently in a serious condition. Two children walking with them were not injured.
About five hours later, they fatally shot Rich Smith and their 18-year-old son Tyler Smith, who were browsing the brightly-lit parking lot of a Kia car dealership, police said.
Twenty minutes later, Dalton allegedly opened fire on four women parked outside a nearby Cracker Barrel restaurant, killing them all. The shooting also left a 14-year-old in critical condition.
The victims “appear to be chosen at random, because they were available,” Kalamazoo County prosecutor Jeff Getting said at a news conference.
“They were shot multiple times, multiple — nine, 10, 11 shell casings at each of these scenes.”
The rampage and subsequent manhunt spanned nearly seven hours, authorities said.
Dalton was arrested in Kalamazoo at 12.40am following a massive manhunt.  They are expected to be arraigned on murder charges this morning.
About
After about 7 days, we realized we were being overcharged by our vendor in their offering. So since then, we've worked to find a new vendor that can offer the quality that we're looking for and have found a great company to work with.
We've created a whole new tier pricing model. We want to ensure you that the artists will be paid the same amount as before, and that the card stock quality is the same. The only change we've made is moving to a vendor who charges a fair price.
Also, all backers who remain at their previous level will be reimbursed for the new price if they do not switch, so there's no need to worry.
The Project
5 Color Combos has successfully created two sets of collectors tokens. The Four Horsemen Edition and the Gods Edition. Each of these are specifically tailored to be tokens used in games to represent creatures and interactions.
This Is Something New
In this project we were inspired to create something new to broaden the usefulness of our token collection. We've merged the idea of playing cards and tokens to create our own 5 Color Combo Collectors Playing Cards & Tokens.
Our custom back design takes the essence of the 5 Color Combo logo and transforms it to match with the expected aesthetics of a playing card set.
Why Playing Cards + Tokens?
It's common among trading card game players to have a box of typical playing cards in their bags for those just in case moments when there is downtime and friends want to play a game and they don't have their tcg with them.
Also, in our own play experiences, there have been moments where we leave our tokens at home for our tcg deck and end up using dice or other cards to represent game state. Having the tokens serve another purpose makes it an easy way to always have them on hand.
We wanted to have top quality playing card card stock as well as custom artwork. So we've built a team to make something amazing.
The Artists
We're working with three amazing fantasy artists. Jason Nguyen, Sandara Tang, and Daniel Kamarudin.
Jason Nguyen
Jason is professional freelance illustrator and concept artist based in Toronto Canada.  They are a very self-motivated and passionate artist who is deeply inspired by the world of fantasy. Their works mainly consist of high fantasy, character-based illustrations and concept art.
They have done work that consists of book cover's, card illustrations, character designs and promotional art.  They are always open to taking on new projects and challenges.
Sandara Tang
Sandara has been a professional artist for over 5 years based in Singapore, Singapore. She's passionate about dragons and fantasy artwork. In addition to their digital art work, they create coins, pins, and 3D prints of amazing works that they often sell on etsy.
Daniel Kamarudin
Daniel specializes in fantasy based concept art and illustration but is flexible with the subject matter. He's done work for productions like Whill of Agora - Book 5: Kingdoms in Chaoes, The Starfall Knight, and The War of Broken Mirrors - Book 1: Forging Divinity.
Playing Cards + Tokens
Each card in the deck has the artwork and label to represent creatures that can be used as tokens in card games. We've carefully chosen creature types that match the stats on each card that are most typically bought from our token collections.
In the example below you can see the 2, 3, 4, and 5. These have been paired up with creature types that commonly have stats of 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, 5/5 like the Knight, Beast, Dragon, and Demon.
Each of the 54 cards in the deck have unique artwork that match each of the types of possible tokens like these Spades for example.
Jacks, Queens, and Kings
For the royal family we've reserved these positions for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Demons, and Mythological Gods. We needed positions of power represented and felt that these did the job well.
Jacks
Queens
Kings
What About The Rest?
We want this deck of Playing Cards & Tokens to be fun and functional. We've carefully handcrafted the merging of the art and the playing card so that both can be easily recognized in the deck. Take the Angel 4/4 of Spades for instance. You can clearly see that this is card is the 4 of Spades while also being an 4/4 Angel token.
Each card in this collection has unique artwork and has been put together by collaborating with the three amazing artists Danial Kamarudin, Sandara Tang, and Jason Nguyen.
Here's the breakdown of all the cards in the deck.
The Good Design Test
We wanted to ensure the answer was YES for the following two questions:
Can I easily tell what suite and number these cards are for playing card games like Nertz and Slap Jack?
During a strategy game, are these cards easily recognizable as the tokens and types they're supposed to represent?
After extensive design revisions, user feedback, and testing, we feel that this deck clearly meets our criteria. It's a strong yes!
Now that we've explained everything going into the making and choices of this deck, here are the designs for all the cards.
Diamonds
Diamonds include: Goblin, Bird, Beast, Dragon, Demon, Dragon, Elder, Beast, Golem, Elder, War & Ruin, Fallen Angel, and Thor.
Clubs
Clubs include: Soldier, Cat, Beast, Angel, Demon, Beast, Elemental, Beast, Golem, Elemental, Feast & Famine, Gethsemoni, and Poseidon.
Hearts
Hearts include: Elemental, Knight, Beast, Dragon, Demon, Wurm, Elder, Elemental, Golem, Elder, Conquest & Glory, Marquess Kimaris, and Hades.
Spades
Spades include: Spirit, Zombie, Centaur, Angel, Demon, Beast, Elemental, Beast, Kraken, Clone, Death & Despair, Duke Dantallion, and Zeus.
Jokers

Tehran responded to an International Atomic Energy Agency offer to send its uranium abroad for enrichment by submitting a counterproposal.
Britain and other European Union nations were preparing to reject the new plan last night, raising the threat of a protracted confrontation and new sanctions.
Iran presented its response to the deal drawn up by the United States, Russia and France on and Germany on Thursday.
It came as European Union foreign ministers were meeting in Brussels and they were last night thrashing out a common response.
France said it was still hopeful the original deal would be agreed but it is understood that neither Britain nor France and Germany will accept Iran's new terms.
They believe Iran is trying to use the deal merely as a starting point to draw other countries into another protracted round of talks. During that time they think the Iranians could continue to enrich uranium and conduct more research on the scientific know-how necessary to turn it into a nuclear weapon.
"It's like playing chess with a monkey," said one diplomat close to the talks. "You get them to checkmate, and then they swallow the king."
Under the deal, put forward by Mohammed ElBaradei, the director-general of the IAEA, Iran would hand over three quarters of its 1.6 ton stockpile of low-enriched uranium to Russia for further processing.
It would be handed back in the form of fuel plates, which cannot be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. The plates would supply Iran's research reactor, used to make radioisotopes for medical purposes.
The transfer would mean Iran no longer had enough low-enriched uranium to enrich to the higher levels needed to build a weapon.
Iran was given until last Friday to respond, but asked for a delay until this week. Its counter-offer was not made public by the IAEA, which reacted cautiously.
But Iranian media have said, and diplomats have confirmed, it involved handing over only small parcels of the enriched uranium at a time.
The Iranians would want more highly enriched uranium to be handed over in return simultaneously.
Other diplomatic sources said Iran was demanding that even if the uranium was handed over, it should still be refined inside the country under supervision.
"The Director General is engaged in consultations with the government of Iran as well as all relevant parties, with the hope that agreement on their proposal can be reached soon," the IAEA said.
That suggested the IAEA was prepared to countenance a reopening of talks on the issue.
That may well be agreed by Russia, which has urged continued negotiations and the use of further sanctions against Iran only in the last resort. Such a decision would herald a split with the EU – which western diplomats fear was Iran's intention.
Focus will turn to President Barack Obama, who has staked much of their foreign policy on their willingness to "hold out the hand of friendship" to historic diplomatic enemies, but is under strong pressure to take a tougher stance.
Even if Iran had accepted the deal, it would only have meant a delay in its theoretical ability to build a nuclear weapon. It has pledged to continue enriching uranium, in defiance of demands by the United Nations, though it denies it intends to build a nuclear weapon.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has already heralded the existence of the deal as a sign of a volte-face in western attitudes to their regime, particularly in America, whose former president, George W. Bush, named the country part of the "axis of evil".
"We welcome fuel exchange, nuclear co-operation, building of power plants and reactors and we are ready to co-operate," Mr Ahmadinejad said in a speech shown live on state television.

MANILA, Philippines - In yet another move to repair strained relations with Beijing, President Duterte is ready to offer visa-free travel to Chinese tourists when they embark on a three-day state visit to China on Oct. 18-21.
The President disclosed to The STAR that they will visit Brunei Darussalam on Oct. 16-18, then Tokyo and Moscow, Russia later this year.
Former president Fidel Ramos is included in the official delegation to China. Duterte earlier designated Ramos as special envoy to help rekindle bilateral relations between the two countries in the aftermath of The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration's ruling in favor of the Philippines' claims over its exclusive economic zone in South China Sea.
The Philippine leader has repeatedly declared they will not go beyond the arbitral court's ruling in their discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping when they hold bilateral talks in Beijing.
Visa-free privileges are currently given by the Philippine government to travelers from about 50 countries that include member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as island states across the globe.
A visa waiver entitles visitors to come to the Philippines and stay from 14 days to a maximum of 150 days. Such a visa waiver, however, must be on a reciprocal basis. This would necessitate Beijing to extend the same visa-free privilege to Filipino travelers to China.
According to data from the website of China National Tourism
Administration, the Philippines ranked 11th in top source travel markets of China, with more than a million arrivals, up 3.7 percent from 2014. The top three destinations of Chinese tourists are Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Last year, Chinese arrivals in the Philippines reached 490,841, or 24.28 percent higher than the 394,951 recorded arrivals in 2014. They occupied fourth spot with 9.16 percent share of the market.
From January to July this year, there were 422,801 accumulated arrivals from China, good for third spot with 11.95 percent of the market share.
The grant of visa waiver, the President pointed out, would enable the Philippines to capture a huge chunk of Chinese tourists going abroad driven by the vigorous growth of China's economy.
However, Duterte acknowledged concerns over possible adverse impact on the country's security, especially with the number of Chinese drug lords arrested here and other China-based criminals who may take advantage of such visa-free privilege.
This, they said, was why they confronted Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua about this concern. “I asked the ambassador himself, ‘Are you trying to destabilize my country with these drugs?' They assured me they in China too have serious problems with drugs and are doing the same campaign to stamp them out,” the President said.
“China offered to help and build the (drug) rehab,” they added.
The President's concerns were apparently officially relayed to Beijing, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang addressing the issue in a press briefing in China last Sept. 29.
“We stand ready to have anti-drug cooperation with the Philippines and formulate a common action plan for it,” Geng said.
“The Chinese government is resolute in cracking down on drug crimes. With clearly defined policies and notable achievements, China is a staunch force in the international endeavor against drug crimes.”
The President explained this was why they cannot intercede in the cases of convicted Filipinos facing the death penalty in China for drug offenses.
“It's the same thing in the case of (Mary Jane) Veloso when I told Indonesian President Widodo I would not interfere in your country's laws,” Duterte said.
The possible grant of visa-free privilege to China is being eyed after the President was informed about the problem of an estimated 300,000 Filipinos working illegally in China.
As this developed, President Duterte welcomed the acceptance of veteran journalist and China expert Santiago “Chito” Sta. Romana, former CNN bureau chief in Beijing, to become the new Philippine ambassador to China. Sta. Romana previously worked as Beijing bureau chief of ABC News.
The President also signed the re-appointment papers of Carlos Chan as Philippine special envoy to China. This will be the third term for Chan, chairperson emeritus of the Oishi Group of Companies that has several manufacturing factories all over China. The President's state visit to China comes after their visit to Vietnam last Sept. 28. Their first trip abroad as head of state was to Laos on Sept. 5 when they formally accepted the ASEAN chairpersonship for the next leaders' summit to be hosted by Manila next year.
From Laos, they proceeded to Indonesia for a state visit on Sept. 8.

It's not unheard of for diehard sports fans to travel across the country to see their favorite team play. But getting married on enemy turf? That's a little more unconventional, and it's just how Julia Abbott and Greg Comer like it.
The couple, both loyal West Virginia University fans, will tie the knot near Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium on Saturday, shortly before the WVU Mountaineers take on the Longhorns.
Why wed at a football game? “Why not?” says Julia Abbott. “We're huge football fans, and so are our friends. We love tailgating and all that comes with it. We wanted to do something fun, something different.”
Fair enough. But why travel from their Bridgeport, West Virginia, home all the way to Austin? Abbott says the choice was more intuitive that some might think. “I've always loved Texas,” they say. The cowboy boot-wearing, country music-listening, warm-weather-loving Abbott begged their parents to let them transfer to UT after their first-year student year at WVU. They said no, but they still heard a siren call, at one point even considering a graduate school application.
“I just think UT has a great history,” Abbott says. “And I've felt drawn to it. I love warm weather, and Greg and I both work in oil and gas, which is big in Texas, so there are similarities.”
When they saw that the WVU-Texas game was scheduled for Oct. 6., the first anniversary of their first date with Comer, Abbott asked their fiancé: “Want to get married at the game?”
Their response: “That would be my dream wedding.”
Several of their football-loving friends were already planning to travel to the game, so it made logistical sense. They started calling UT officials, and before long, they reached Texas Exes program director Carol Barrett.
Barrett knew just the person to officiate the wedding: Longhorn legend Harley Clark, co-creator of the Hook 'em Horns sign. Retired judge Clark, BA '57, MA '60, LLB '62, Life Member, is no stranger to Texas gameday weddings: they last performed one for a Texas couple during halftime in 2009.
About 100 friends and family members of the couple will attend the wedding—and, of course, the post-wedding, pre-game tailgate reception nearby. Then Abbott and Comer will change from their formal wear into homemade t-shirts reading “Just married” and “We tied the knot in the parking lot” before going to the game.

Today the page proofs arrived from Princeton University Press for my critical edition of W. H. Auden's long poem For the Time Being: a Christmas Oratorio. It's obviously an opportune time for me to be looking again at this remarkable poem, and I may have a few things to say about it as Christmas draws nearer. For now, just one comment:
When Auden was nearly finished with the poem, they sent a typescript of it to their father, a learned physician named George Augustus Auden (who, by the way, deserves more scholarly attention in their own right than they have ever received — they were a remarkable man). The elder Auden found the poem baffling: it was a retelling of the Nativity narrative, so why at the beginning is there a clock over the mantelpiece? Why does Joseph say “My trousers were cleaned and pressed”? Why does Herod complain that throughout their kingdom “there isn't a single town where a good bookshop would pay”? Auden replied,
Sorry you are puzzled by the oratorio. Perhaps you were expecting a purely historical account as one might give of the battle of Waterloo, whereas I was trying to treat it as a religious event which eternally recurs every time it is accepted. Thus the historical fact that the shepherds were shepherds is religiously accidental — the religious fact is that they were the poor and humble of this world for whom at this moment the historical expression is the city-proletariat, and so on with all the other figures. What we know of Herod, for instance, is that they were a Hellenised-Jew and a political ruler. Accordingly I have made them express the intellectual's eternal objection to Christianity — that it replaces objectivity with subjectivity — and the politician's eternal objection that it regards the state as having only a negative role. (see Marcus Aurelius.)… I am not the first to treat the Christian data in this way, until the 18th Cent. it was always done, in the Mystery Plays for instance or any Italian paintings. It is only in the last two centuries that religion has been “humanized,” and therefore treated historically as something that happened a long time ago, hence the nursery picture of Jesus in a nightgown and a Parsifal beard. If a return to the older method now seems startling it is partly because of the acceleration in the rate of historical change due to industrialization — there is a far greater difference between the accidents of life in 1600 AD and in 1942 than between those of 30 AD and 1600.
Auden is of course right — he's almost always right — and it's worth thinking about how a culture's understanding of Christianity changes when the events described in the Bible become purely historical, things that happened but no longer happen.
Stanley Spencer was an English painter from the generation before Auden, and they wrestled with many of the same questions. If painters of the Italian Renaissance could portray Biblical scenes happening in a Tuscan landscape, why couldn't a man from Cookham do the same? So many of Spencer's paintings, starting from early in their career, set biblical scenes in Cookham. The picture above is their rendering of the Betrayal of Christ (1922–1923), now held by the National Museums of Norther Ireland. You can see nearly two hundred of Spencer's paintings here.

An Indian navigation satellite remained stuck to its launcher after climbing into orbit Thursday when the rocket's aerodynamic payload shroud failed to jettison as planned several minutes after liftoff, dealing the country's workhorse booster its first total failure since 1993.
Video from an on-board camera appeared to show the IRNSS 1H navigation craft still cocooned inside the fairing long after it was supposed to separate.
The chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organization, A.S. Kiran Kumar, declared the launch a failure in a press conference after the flight, according to Indian news reports.
An Indian Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle blasted off at 1330 GMT (9:30 a.m. EDT) from the Satish Dhawan Space Center on India's east coast with the eighth satellite for the country's regional navigation network. The payload was supposed to replace a spacecraft launched four years ago with faulty payload components.
Liftoff occurred at 7 p.m. Indian Standard Time.
The 144-foot-tall (44-meter) PSLV attempted to heave the eighth satellite in the Indian Regional Satellite System — IRNSS 1H — into an orbit stretching more than 12,800 miles (20,650 kilometers) above Earth.
But the rocket carried the extra weight of its clamshell-like nose cone all the way to orbit. Burdened with the extra load, the PSLV's fourth stage reached an orbit with a maximum altitude of 4,072 miles (6,554 kilometers).
A launch commentator on ISRO's live webcast of the flight noted a “variation in the performance” of the rocket as the PSLV's twin-engine fourth stage began firing. The upper stage continued its burn, and the launch commentator announced the command to separate the IRNSS 1H satellite
ISRO's range operations director confirmed the payload fairing, or heat shield, remained attached to the rocket.
“During the flight, the heat shield has not separated,” the range operations director said shortly after IRNSS 1H was supposed to deploy from the rocket. “Further analysis will be carried out subsequently.”
A video monitor inside the PSLV launch control center appeared to show the IRNSS 1H satellite trapped inside the fairing well after the shroud was supposed to jettison.
The payload fairing was programmed to release at T+plus 3 minutes, 23 seconds, once the PSLV soared above the dense lower layers of the atmosphere. The structure shields the satellite from weather during the final launch countdown, then protects the payload from aerodynamic forces as the rocket climbs into space.
Thursday's mishap was the first incident on a PSLV launch since 1997, when a rocket delivered an Earth observation satellite to a lower-than-planned — but usable — polar orbit. It was the first total PSLV launch failure since the rocket's inaugural flight in 1993, a span of 39 successful and partially successful missions in a row.
Two versions of India's larger Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle — the GSLV Mk.1 and GSLV Mk.2 — have a more mixed record, with 7 successful flights in 11 attempts.
IRNSS 1H was to replace the first Indian navigation satellite in the IRNSS fleet — IRNSS 1A — stricken with failed atomic clocks, eliminating its ability to transmit precise position data to users on the ground. Designed for a 10-year mission, IRNSS 1A is otherwise healthy can still be used for basic message relay functions, according to the Indian Space Research Organization.
The three rubidium atomic clocks on the IRNSS 1A satellite have failed since its launch in July 2013, leaving the spacecraft powerless in achieving its primary mission. Sourced from a Swiss company, the clocks are needed to keep precise time on the satellite, a measure needed to help derive the exact location of a receiver on the ground.
The rubidium clocks come from the same vendor as several clocks that have failed on Europe's Galileo navigation satellites. Engineers say they fixed the clocks on the IRNSS 1H spacecraft launched Thursday, and the launch of the next batch of four European Galileo navigation satellites was delayed from earlier this year until December to ensure their clocks will not succumb to the same problem.
Launching with six lengthened solid rocket boosters — a configuration ISRO calls the PSLV XL — India's workhorse launcher headed east from the Satish Dhawan Space Center over the Bay of Bengal following liftoff Thursday. The six boosters, each packed with 12 metric tons of pre-loaded solid propellant, fired more than a minute. Four of the motors ignited at liftoff, and the other pair fired at T+plus 25 seconds.
A core first stage solid-fueled motor burned in unison with the six strap-on boosters. The PSLV's core and boosters collectively generated 1.7 million pounds of thrust.
The first stage dropped away at T+plus 1 minute, 50 seconds, at an altitude of more than 180,000 feet (55 kilometers). A single hydrazine-fueled Vikas engine ignited for a firing lasting two-and-a-half minutes.
The rocket's clamshell-like payload shroud was scheduled to peel away during the second stage burn.
A solid-fueled third stage motor ignited and burned nearly four minutes. The fourth stage, powered by two hydrazine-fueled thrusters producing around 3,400 pounds of thrust, then took over for a firing to inject the mission's navigation payload into an elliptical, oval-shaped orbit high above Earth.
The PSLV's flight computer aimed to release the IRNSS 1H satellite in an orbit between 176 miles (284 kilometers) and 12,831 miles (20,650 kilometers). The target orbit had an inclination of 19.2 degrees to the equator.
The fairing failure caused the rocket to reach a lower orbit ranging in altitude between 103 miles (167 kilometers) and 4,072 miles (6,554 kilometers) at an inclination of 19.2 degrees.
Deployment of the IRNSS 1H satellite was scheduled for T+plus 19 minutes, 25 seconds, but the command to separate the spacecraft was issued about a minute-and-a-half earlier, according to ISRO's launch commentator.
IRNSS 1H's on-board engine was supposed to circularize its orbit at an altitude of nearly 22,300 miles (35,800 kilometers) in the first few weeks after launch. The satellite's final operational geosynchronous orbit was to be tilted 29 degrees to the equator, a perch that would have oscillated north and south of the equator at 55 degrees east longitude.
In that orbit, IRNSS 1H was to stay constantly in the sky over India. Like its predecessors, the IRNSS 1H satellite was built for a 10-year mission.
Unlike U.S., Russian, European and Chinese navigation fleets designed for global reach, India's navigation satellite constellation is intended to provide positioning services over the country's domestic territory and neighboring nations.

Opposition politicians have raised suspicion that a cult was behind President Park Geun-hye's oddly intimate relationship with their longtime friend Choi Soon-sil.“This is not even a dictatorship,” Choo Mi-ae, chairperson of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, said Thursday. “It's a scary theocracy.”She added, “Park never communicated with the people. They never communicated with the public servants, vice ministers or ministers. They only had their spiritual communication with Choi.”Park's relationship with the scandal-ridden friend goes back decades. Choi, 60, is a daughter of the late Choi Tae-min, Park's mentor. According to various records, Park and Choi Tae-min first met after First Lady Yuk Young-soo was assassinated. They wrote to them and claimed the late Yuk had appeared to them in their dreams and delivered a message.“Park has also been forced to explain their own past, including their relationship some 35 years ago with a pastor, Choi Tae-min, whom their opponents characterize as a ‘Korean Rasputin,' and how they controlled Park during their time in the Blue House when they were first lady after their mother's assassination,” a diplomatic cable by then U.S. Ambassador Alexander Vershbow said in 2007, before the presidential election. It was a confidential report, but was made public by WikiLeaks in 2011.Vershbow continued, “Perhaps even more damaging to their image as the maiden who sacrificed themselves in the service of the nation upon the assassination of their mother, Park has been linked to the late Choi Tae-min, a charismatic pastor. Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park's body and soul during their formative years and that their children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.”Born in 1912 in Hwanghae Province, Choi Tae-min reportedly worked as a police officer during the Japanese colonial period and became a Buddhist monk after Korea's liberation. In the early 1970s, they established their own cult, Yeongsegyo, literally “Eternal Life,” by combining tenets of Buddhism, Christianity and Korea's indigenous Confucian-shamanist movement, Cheondoism. They created the Korea Salvation Mission in April 1975. Park attended its masses in subsequent months. In 1976, Park became the president of the New Heart Volunteer Group, established by Choi.But Choi was questioned by Park's father, President Park Chung-hee, in September 1977 based on the intelligence agency's report of their corruption. Nevertheless, they managed to evade any criminal charges. Kim Jae-gyu, then head of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency who assassinated the strongman on Oct. 26, 1979, later wrote in their appeals that Park Chung-hee's inaction against Choi was one of their motivations for assassinating him.Choi Soon-sil, the fifth daughter of Choi Tae-min, first met Park Geun-hye as the university student president of the volunteer group. They left for Germany in 1979 to study and returned to Korea in 1985.The Choi family gained media attention in 1986 when Park's little sister, Geun-ryeong, wrote a letter to the Blue House to expose their abuse of power over a nonprofit foundation for children's welfare. “Choi is a crook and they should be sternly punished and my sister Park Geun-hye should be saved from their capture,” they wrote at the time.Choi Tae-min died in 1994, but rumors spread that their daughter continued to exert their cult-based influence over Park.“Choi Soon-sil reportedly said North Korea will collapse within two years,” said Rep. Woo Sang-ho, floor leader of the Minjoo Party, said Thursday. “She appeared to be a shamanist prophet. If Park was captivated by their prophecy and implemented their foreign and North Korea policies, this is a serious problem.”On Wednesday, Rep. Park Jie-won, acting head of the People's Party, also raised a similar suspicion. “Park must have been captivated by the cult of Choi Tae-min and Choi Soon-sil,” they said.Rumors spread further as it was pointed out that Park often used unusual expressions in their speeches, possibly influenced by Choi.“If you do not learn history properly, your soul will become abnormal,” Park said on Nov. 10, 2015. “If you wish earnestly, the entire universe will help you,” Park said in their Children's Day speech in 2015.Park admitted Tuesday that they had sought Choi's help in editing their speeches, but it is unclear if those remarks were written by Choi.Rumors also spread that Choi had established a secret inner circle, named the “Eight Fairies,” to control state affairs. The National Intelligence Service's logo was abruptly changed earlier this year to depict a dragon, and speculation has spread that it symbolizes the Mi-R Foundation. Mireu is an ancient Korean word for “dragon,” and Choi was accused of using the foundation to strong-arm conglomerates to make massive donations and then embezzling the money.Park's inaugural ceremony was also questioned by observers. During the ceremony, a tree of hope was created at the Gwanghwamun Square and small silk purses were hung on it. The traditional purses were supposed to symbolize the link between humans and the universe and to conjure happiness. A file stored on a tablet computer recovered from Choi's office by JTBC, the TV network of the JoongAng Media Group, showed the designs of the purses.BY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]

HOPE
Music and lyric by Jason Robert Brown
Sheet music available on SheetMusicDirect.com.
I come to sing a song about hope.
I'm not inspired much right now, but even so,
I came out here to sing a song. So here I go.
I guess I think
That if I tinker long enough, one might appear.
And look! It's here.
One verse is done.
The work's begun.
I come to sing a song about hope.
In spite of everything ridiculous and sad,
Though I'm beyond belief depressed, confused and mad,
Well – I got dressed.
I underestimated how much that would take.
I didn't break
Until right now.
I sing of hope
And don't know how.
So maybe I can substitute “strength,”
Because I'm strong.
I'm strong enough.
I got through lots of things I didn't think I could,
And so did you.
I know that's true.
And so we sing a song about hope.
Though I can't guarantee there's something real behind it,
I have to try to show my daughters I can find it,
And so today –
When life is crazy and impossible to bear –
It must be there.
Fear never wins.
That's what I hope.
See? I said “hope.”
The work begins.

“I thank the Lord God most of all — he's my savior,” they added. “Every day I thank my savior I am alive.”
Asked about the governor's decision, they said, “I won't get into all that; I'll just say that Jesus is the reason we celebrate Christmas.”
Mr. White, who had served five months at an upstate New York prison for the killing, was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and of criminal possession of a weapon. They had remained free on bail during an appeal, but after the appeal was rejected, a judge gave them a sentence of 20 months to 4 years in prison, a spokesperson for the State Division of Parole said. The maximum sentence, under legal guidelines, would have been between 4 and 11 years.
In July, Mr. White began serving their sentence at the Mount McGregor Correctional Facility, in Saratoga County. They would have been eligible for parole roughly two months after their first hearing date, next October.
Frederick K. Brewington, a defense lawyer who represented Mr. White during the trial, said a group of advocates for Mr. White made an application to Mr. Paterson for a pardon, “outlining the reasons, what the particulars were and the value to the community.” They added that supporters of Mr. White had organized a letter-writing campaign to urge the governor to consider Mr. White's case.

A commutation lessens the severity of the punishment. A pardon excuses or forgives the offense itself.

At the trial, Mr. White testified that their son woke them from a deep sleep the night of the shooting, yelling that “some kids are coming here to kill me.” Mr. White said they considered the angry teenagers a “lynch mob.”
Mr. White said their racist language recalled the hatred they saw as a child visiting the segregated Deep South and stories of their grandfather's being chased out of Alabama in the 1920s by the Ku Klux Klan. They testified that their grandfather taught them how to shoot and bequeathed them the pistol they used.

But Mr. White said the shooting happened accidentally after they began turning to retreat and Daniel lunged at the gun.
Thomas Spota, the Suffolk County district attorney, said in a statement, “I strongly believe the governor should have had the decency and the compassion to at least contact the victim's family to allow them to be heard before commuting the defendant's sentence.”
Reached at their auto body shop in Port Jefferson Station, the teenager's father, Daniel Cicciaro, reacted with annoyance when a reporter identified himself.

“Yeah, what do you need? An oil change?” they said. “We got nothing to say about it.”
Mr. Brewington said that Mr. White was released from prison at 8 a.m. on Thursday, and that the White family was happy with the decision.
“They're all very thankful, particularly at this time of year for the blessings bestowed upon them and the thoughtful approach by the governor's office,” Mr. Brewington said.
Mr. Paterson has granted nine pardons, three commutations and one clemency, and plans to make more pardons in immigration cases before leaving office on Dec. 31, officials in their office said Thursday.
The governor began a special clemency process in the spring intended to help permanent legal residents who were at risk of deportation because of long-ago or minor convictions. This month, they pardoned six of those immigrants, including a financial administrator at the City University of New York.
In the case of Mr. White, their lawyer, Mr. Brewington, acknowledged that race had played a big role in the trial, but they cautioned against viewing the commutation as racially based, especially because Mr. Paterson is black.

“He reviewed this matter as they review any other matter,” they said. “People have to be careful not to fan the flames of racism. If the governor happened to be white and they commuted the sentence of a white person, would that be an issue?”
Dear Justice Kennedy,
We know that Supreme Court justices traditionally announce their departure from the bench when the Court ends its term in late June. Fresh off their victory at the appointment of Neil Gorsuch–the only victory that Republicans can claim despite controlling two branches of government–they began speculating that you would be the next justice to step down. We don't need to remind you that June also marks the second anniversary of Obergefell v. Hodges, your masterpiece ruling in favor of marriage freedom.
President Trump, in their typical hamfisted way, has spoken openly about the rumors, while Sen. Charles Grassley, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters this spring that “I would expect a resignation this summer,” pointing to you in everything but name. Some of your former clerks suggest that you won't stay on the Court much longer as well.
At 80 years of age, and with nearly 30 years on the Court, you have served the nation well and deserve a restful retirement. But sometimes our wishes and our duties to the nation and the constitution are in conflict. We would suggest that this is one of those times.
You've contributed many opinions over the years, but there is no doubt that your greatest legacy will be your advancement of LGBTQ equality, of which you are rightfully proud. Never has the Court had a more eloquent and fervent advocate protecting the rights of sexual minorities. The four landmark rulings of the past 25 years are all owed to you. First came Romer v. Evans, the challenge to an anti-gay ballot measure in Colorado. In that 1996 case, you wrote banning nondiscrimination measures was “inexplicable by anything but animus,” incredibly powerful words from a Court that ten years earlier had upheld sodomy laws.
Then came your ruling on those very same sodomy laws, which the majority struck down in 2003. In that opinion, you wrote that the law protects adults, including gay adults, who are engaged in sexual acts in the privacy of their own homes. These opinions, which followed major shifts in public opinion, were made all the more poignant by the fact that you were appointed by a Republican and were considered a conservative Catholic legal scholar.
Those two opinions alone changed the landscape for us, giving us legal protections that we never had before. But they were just the start. Then came the marriage rulings. First, you wrote the majority opinion striking down the odious Defense of Marriage Act, and then two years later came back with the eloquent majority opinion that made marriage legal once and for all. We are hoping it is the final word on marriage equality.
As you know better than anyone, your retirement would put many of those gains in jeopardy. The list of your potential replacements makes your late colleague Antonin Scalia look like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The very animus that you decried in your first major gay ruling is still alive and well among your fellow judges. Most of your rulings were 5-4 decisions. Your departure would tip the Court in the direction of the dissenters, making them the majority.
Also, remember the undemocratic way the Republican Party is recreating its majority. We know you rise above partisanship, and are secretly appalled that the Senate blocked President Obama's extremely well qualified appointee who was then replaced by a Trump appointee–despite the fact that Trump won far fewer votes not just than Obama but Hillary Clinton as well. This court stacking could take years to undo.
So we ask you: Please don't go. Not in the middle of a Trumpian constitutional crisis. Not yet, at least. We ask you to at least wait until after the midterm election when we have fighting chance of a Senate majority that will block any closed minded appointees.
Your presence on the Court is the only thing that guarantees our rights remain whole, and that progress continues apace. The type of conservative judge who would replace you may not be able to overturn your rulings outright, but they or they will pick away at them, limiting and eroding them at every possible turn. The generosity of spirit and common decency that your rulings reflected likely will not be found in your successor. The extreme GOP ideological vetting process for that person will guarantee a sterling record of antigay rulings.
We know it's asking a lot. But we're not just thinking of ourselves. We're thinking of your legacy. Waiting a few more years to ensure that it lasts seems a fair request.
We respectfully hope that you agree.
Write your own open letter to Anthony Kennedy in comments below. LGBTQ Nation and our sister site, Queerty, will bundle the letters together and personally deliver them to the Supreme Court in time for the second anniversary of marriage equality June 26.

TEMPE, Ariz. -- Sitting by the pool in their apartment complex just a few miles outside Arizona State's campus, Jaelen Strong appears relaxed. It could be because they recently woke up from a nap. Or it's possible that's just their general demeanor. The hazy Arizona backdrop certainly adds to the serene feeling.
The Sun Devils are a couple of days away from a nationally televised showdown with Notre Dame on Nov. 8, a game they'll go on to win 55-31. Strong, who is well on their way to their second straight 1,000-plus-yard receiving season, will make five catches for 58 yards with a touchdown. Blessed with an uncommon blend of size and speed, the Arizona State wideout is coveted by NFL scouts who believe they haven't come close to reaching their full potential.
Decked out in a black shirt and shorts both sporting the school's trademark pitchfork logo, Strong can seem quiet to those who don't know them well. Yet it's what's underneath their physically imposing 6-foot-3, 215-pound exterior that truly helped them get to this point.
Long before Strong would star with the Sun Devils, making countless acrobatic plays that require liberal use of the DVR, the redshirt junior from Philadelphia got their first tattoo. It features a pair of praying hands on the right side of their chest and the words “In Memory Of John Rankin” in script on the left side.
As they have collected tattoos -- they have almost 30 now -- Strong has assembled a group of mementos that represent their past, their present and what they desire out of their future. But it's that first ink that fuels him, serving as a reminder of the man they play for as they eye the fulfillment of their childhood dream to reach the NFL.

Strong's father, John Rankin, was a basketball legend at West Catholic High in Philadelphia. They towered over defenders at a nimble 6-8 and parlayed a stellar prep career into a scholarship at Drexel, where they scored 2,111 career points, including a single-game program record 44 against Rider in 1988. They were a member of the team that upset David Robinson and Navy in '87 and was inducted into the school's athletic hall of fame in 2004.
When Jaelen returns to Philadelphia, locals approach them and mention the time Drexel defeated the great David Robinson. “I still go home and people ask me about my dad,” Strong said. “It's a legacy he'll forever have in Philadelphia.”
After their playing days were over, Rankin became a detective with the Philadelphia police and could often be found around the community. A plaque featuring their photo still hangs in the hallway at West Catholic.
In 2002, however, Rankin was diagnosed with leukemia. Jaelen regularly visited their dad in the hospital and always assumed they would be all right.
“At that age they couldn't understand,” Jaelen's mother, Alexis Strong, said. “When John went into remission, Jaelen thought [his] dad was OK. When they went back in, I think Jaelen realized how serious it was. John physically changed. They were weak. At the time, we thought Jaelen really handled it well because they rarely cried. I think they thought they had to be strong. When it really got bad, when we realized John wasn't going to make it, Jaelen took on this shell like they were OK.”
Rankin died on April 4, 2003. They were 36 at the time. Jaelen was just 9.
“It was like a blow to almost the whole city of Philadelphia,” Rankin's friend Shawn Wilson said in a documentary that Strong and director Dev Kamera released in August 2013. “John was just that type of guy. They were very charismatic, very likable, lovable. Once they got sick, that really threw all of us off.”
The death affected Jaelen more than anyone realized. Alexis believes they didn't process it for years, and those close to them thought they handled it well because they didn't outwardly show pain. They avoided talking about their feelings and they began to boil over, affecting their schoolwork and their relationships with others.
It was only later when Jaelen lashed out that Alexis, who never married Jaelen's father but remained close friends with them after they broke up in 1995, decided to do something. They pushed Jaelen to begin counseling when they were a junior at West Catholic.
“That's where Jaelen's behavior really went south,” Alexis said. “That's when we realized they never handled the loss of their dad. It was a lot of grief that built up and turned into anger. They were very close. Looking back they didn't handle it when [John] was ill and passed away, but then we had to address it in high school.”

During their first-year student and sophomore years at West Catholic, Strong required a lot of growing up. They were young for their grade and acted it. “I had a real bad temper,” they said. “The smallest thing [could] make me upset and take my focus away.”
They didn't take classes as seriously as they should have, landing frequent visits to detention and ultimately a stint in summer school. Come their junior and senior years, when their play started to draw raves, they aren't academically eligible to compete at the Division I level.
Their talent, though, was undeniable. Strong's numbers weren't astounding -- they had just 41 catches in their junior and senior seasons combined -- but that was partially a byproduct of West Catholic's run-heavy offense and tendency to play with a lead. During Strong's senior year, West Catholic beat South Fayette (Pa.) High 50-14 for the Class AA state title.
“Over sophomore year going into junior year they started understanding that they can't do anything about the past,” said Brian Fluck, Strong's coach at West Catholic. “He can only do something about the future.”
Strong then went the junior college route. Their friend Gerald Bowman, now a safety at USC, attended Pierce (Calif.) College, and Strong decided the school would help their future prospects. After grayshirting a year to get their schoolwork in order, they showed the explosive ability that fans have come to expect. They made 67 catches for 1,263 yards with 15 touchdowns in 2012, putting Division I programs on notice.
• ELLIS: What's next for the future of the College Football Playoff?
“It would've been real tough to hide Jaelen from the rest of the world with the numbers that they put up,” said Efrain Martinez, their coach at Pierce. “To be honest I thought they were the best junior college player in America in that season they played for us. They were that incredible.”
On Oct. 19 of that year, Pierce played Santa Barbara City College. Pierce had the ball at its 45-yard line on the final play of the first half. Santa Barbara's defensive backs set back in prevent, about 20 yards off the line of scrimmage. Strong ran past everyone, leapt at the goal line and snatched the ball for a touchdown. In the same game, Martinez says, Strong took a screen pass 70 yards for a score.
Arizona State was one of the first to catch on, and Sun Devils recruiting coordinator Chip Long made a trip to Los Angeles in May 2012. Long noted how Strong was out making every play, and since the Sun Devils had a major need at receiver, they made it a priority to sign the budding star. Long, offensive coordinator Mike Norvell and head coach Todd Graham devised an academic plan for Strong, who was still catching up with online classes. They also began to connect with their family.
“I can remember I got married two years ago, and I'm at my rehearsal dinner, and their mom calls me to tell us they passed their history test,” Long said. “I'm going crazy. I'm on my honeymoon communicating back and forth with mom and him, telling them to keep working. It got so involved it was every day, 10 times a day.”
Strong received interest from many brand-name programs, including Tennessee, Texas Tech, Miami, Nebraska and Ole Miss. Still, when it came time to make a decision, Strong was loyal to the Sun Devils. They committed on Christmas 2012.

Strong made an impact from the moment they stepped foot on Arizona State's campus. They surpassed 100 yards receiving in five of their first six games as a starter, including a dazzling 136-yard, one-touchdown outing in a 37-34 loss to Notre Dame on Oct. 5, 2013. They finished their sophomore season -- and first on the Sun Devils -- with 75 catches for 1,062 yards with 10 scores and entered '14 as the focal point of a potent offense.
This year brought more of the same, as Strong wowed onlookers with one big play after another. Arizona State's high point came in the early November win over Notre Dame, a result that moved the team's record to 8-1 and temporarily kept its College Football Playoff hopes intact.
Strong made one of those plays they are quickly becoming known for: The Sun Devils had possession on the opposing 13-yard line with 3:25 left in the first quarter and a chance to take the lead in a 3-3 game. That's when quarterback Taylor Kelly called their favorite target's number. Strong came under on a switch route, got a step on their man and jumped before reaching back, grabbing the football with one hand and improbably twisting their body to stay inbounds in one motion. It didn't look possible. But in slow motion every action appeared deliberate, and there was no doubt the catch would be ruled a touchdown.
“His ability to get the 50-50 balls and catch the ball in traffic is probably their biggest strength,” ESPN NFL draft analyst Todd McShay said. “I was sitting right there when they caught that ball in the corner of the end zone [against Notre Dame]. It was coming in hot. I didn't think there was much of a chance he'd make that catch. When they put their hands up and plucked that ball away, that was pretty impressive. There aren't many guys that would've made that catch at the college level.”
Plays like that have Strong projected as a late first-round or early second-round pick in next spring's draft, in the tier just below Alabama's Amari Cooper along with West Virginia's Kevin White, Michigan's Devin Funchess and Louisville's DeVante Parker. Strong says they want to play like Brandon Marshall at the next level, but McShay compares them to another Chicago Bears receiver, Alshon Jeffery, for their size and ability to consistently get the ball at its highest point.
Strong announced Monday evening that they would forgo their senior season to enter the 2015 NFL draft. The Sun Bowl will be their final game in an Arizona State uniform. Regardless of what colors they  next, however, he's sure to make return visits to Philadelphia with their head held high.

The same attributes that once made Rankin so beloved in Philadelphia now shine through in Strong. Arizona State quarterback Kelly is quick to point out that Jaelen has a special relationship with their mother -- who made it out to a few games this fall, including the Notre Dame game -- and is just as willing to take pictures with young fans as they are to crack jokes in the locker room when the team needs it.
“Off the field he's a special dude,” Kelly said. “He's a giver. That kid is going to do whatever he'd like to do. Whether it's own a business or play 10 years in the NFL, that kid is going to be an unbelievable human being.”
No matter where Jaelen ends up, their father's impact will always be present.
“He taught me a lot of things they didn't even know they taught me,” Strong said. “When they were sick with cancer they remained positive throughout all the trials and tribulations. They were strong. They smiled no matter what, and they never let me know they were in pain even though I knew they are. That was the biggest thing they taught me. There are little things I complain about, but I'm very blessed. That right there, they were fighting for their life and still smiling, going about their day like nothing was wrong, like they were cancer-free.”
Strong recently got their newest tattoo, and shows it off with pride. This one is on their lower leg, and it features a portrait of their dad's face. Soon it will be hidden under NFL socks on fall Sunday afternoons. But Rankin's picture -- and influence -- will never be far from Jaelen's mind.

Everton face battle to keep Barry as Arsenal, Spurs and Monaco target on loan midfielder
Scouts from Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham are poised to watch Verona's Juan Iturbe on Monday, but they will be awaiting to see if they shake off a thigh injury first.
The brilliant Argentinian winger is on loan from Porto but Verona are to take up the option to buy them at the end of the season and then will consider selling quickly at a profit such is their need for money.
Iturbe has been described as the 'next Lionel Messi' owing to their diminutive stature, pace and dribbling style. Although born in Buenos Aires, they were brought up in Paraguay but has switched allegiance back to Argentina and is being considered by clubs now before their price escalates further.
Hand in the air: Verona's Juan Iturbe is a summer target for Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham
Valuable: Verona are expected to take up their option to sign the Porto player this summer and sell at a profit
Iturbe has scored six goals this season and their wing play has had a major bearing on veteran Luca Toni's revival with the 36-year-old now second in Italy's goalscoring charts with 19 goals.
However, Iturbe picked up a bruised thigh barely 30 minutes into last weekend's 4-0 win over Catania and is a doubt for Monday and scouts may reschedule for their game with Udinese next Saturday.
Manchester United set to release youngsters Barmby, Byrne and Rudge
Jack Barmby, Sam Byrne and Jack Rudge are among the young professionals being released by Manchester United this summer.
Barmby has been on loan at Hartlepool since the end of January and has scored five goals in 17 appearances, including two in their last two games against Morecambe and Plymouth.
The England U19 forward, son of former Tottenham and Everton midfielder Nick, has attracted attention from a few lower league and Championship clubs.
Dublin-born striker Byrne has been on loan at Carlisle. The 18-year-old figured in all of United's UEFA Youth League games.
Versatile midfielder Rudge had a spell on loan with Torquay earlier this year. The 19-year-old, who has also played at full back, has been at United since they were seven.

West Ham to go head-to-head with Fulham for Baggies' Jones
West Ham have joined Fulham by showing interest in West Bromwich Albion defender Billy Jones.
The 27-year-old is out of contract in the summer and has yet to agree terms on a new deal. Although further talks are planned, the former Preston and Crewe full back will consider all options.
Albion is likely to change manager this summer but have expressed interest in Sunderland's Craig Gardner, who is out of contract.
Hot property: West Ham and Fulham are interested in signing West Brom defender Billy Jones
Leicester consider move for Metalist Kharkiv midfielder Blanco
Leicester City are weighing up a cut-price move for Metalist Kharkiv midfielder Sebastian Blanco.
The Premier League new boys are tweaking their squad with manager Nigel Pearson looking to bring in another goalkeeper, centre back, two strikers and midfielder.
Blanco, 26, is an Argentina attacking midfielder who has a dual Spanish passport. They can fit in comfortably on the left or right wing also. They have scored in their last two games against Dnipro and Metalurg.
Metalist value Blanco at around £6million but are struggling financially and may be willing to let them go now for as little as £2.5m.
Cut-price: Leicester could try and sign Metalist Kharkiv midfielder Sebastian Blanco for just £2.5million QPR keep tabs on Dundee United midfielder Armstrong
Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong was watched by Queens Park Rangers scouts last weekend.
The 22-year-old has been one of the Tannadice club's most consistent performers and has grabbed 11 goals this season. Celtic and Everton have also watched the law student closely.
Armstrong, who grew up idolising former Chelsea midfielder Gianfranco Zola, has had good company with clubs continuing to make scouting reports on their club colleagues Andy Robertson, John Souttar and Ryan Gauld.

Pogba's Juventus future to be clarified shortly
Paul Pogba's future at Juventus could be clearer after this weekend. Their agent Mino Raiola is due in Turin for talks over an improved contract amid the backdrop of interest from Paris Saint-Germain and many more.
Raiola said recently that a decision on the 21-year-old former Manchester United midfielder would not be made until after the World Cup, but Juventus want matters cleared up sooner.
Raiola will be at Thursday night's Europa League semi-final second leg against Benfica and is likely to meet Juve executives Beppe Marotta and Fabio Paratici in the hope of extending Pogba's current deal by a year and trebling their net salary to around £3.8million.
For executives, big bonuses are bankruptcy's creamy filling.
For executives, big bonuses are bankruptcy's creamy filling.
More than 1,600 insiders—executives and others controlling a company—received bonuses, salaries, fees and other compensation totaling more than $1.3 billion in the months before their companies filed for Chapter 11, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of more than 80 bankruptcy cases over the past five years.
Blockbuster Inc. paid collective bonuses totaling roughly $775,000 to a dozen top executives and managers one week before its September 2010 bankruptcy filing, according to a banker and a consultant familiar with the plan. The timing was an effort to avoid scrutiny under the bankruptcy law limiting retention plans, they said.
Last week, a federal judge gave Hostess the go-ahead to hand out $1.8 million in bonuses to executives involved in liquidating the company. That seems gross enough, until you realize that it's common practice for companies in or about to enter bankruptcy to hand out big bonuses:Because there are rules limiting bonuses for executives during bankruptcy, companies often hand out the bonuses shortly before filing:But don't worry—Blockbuster's general counsel, who received $100,000, described the bonuses as "relatively small."
With the new season approaching faster than a mazy Ryan Giggs run from the nineties, I have been meandering through my memories of some of the games I have witnessed over the years. These memories have left an indelible mark on me, and they are why I love my team.
My First United Game
The first memory I have of The Reds is my mother taking me to my first match at Old Trafford in 1963. I was six years old and excited but not sure why I was going. Perhaps my dad, a staunch United fan, instructed my mum to introduce me to the Church of Stretford as they had to work Saturdays.
We made our way inside the Old Stand (now called the South Stand), a post-war structure with an evocative aroma of Bovril and cigarette smoke, and an unsettling queue of pot-bellied men, shuffling to make their way to the odious toilets not built for an army.
We walked up the concrete steps to the entrance to our block, which seemed to be up in the gods, and I fully remember the shock and awe of seeing the huge bright green pitch and the tens of thousands of people, more people than I had seen in my then short life. There was a sea of men, women and children wearing red and white scarves, singing and moving to one rhythm; rattles rasping out their war cries.
This being the sixties, and having only seen football on our valve-powered black and white telly, I shrieked quite seriously to my mum, “Hey mum, it's in colour!”
1977 FA Cup Final – Liverpool 1-2 Man Utd
In May 1977, we arrived at the old Wembley ground with United as underdogs. The mighty Liverpool were rampaging through Europe and dominating the then First Division. It was my first trip to Wembley proper, although I had been once before on a school trip to see England v Wales in a dour goalless draw.
In the end, we beat the best team in the land – and our old foes – with a contentious Lou Macari shot that took a deflection off team-mate Jimmy Greenhoff's chest. Who cares which one scored – it gave us the cup and we danced and hugged strangers at the final whistle. The United scarf I wore that day is still hanging in my study six thousand miles from Manchester.
Walking joyously back to our cars, we hid our scarves when we saw a group of Scousers sitting on a wall, waiting to pounce we thought. As we surreptitiously walked by holding back our jubilation, one of the Scousers shouted to us, “Hey cheer up lads, we're going to win the European Cup.” Liverpool were playing German giants Borussia Mönchengladbach and did indeed win their first European cup the very next Wednesday, so we were off the hook.
Man Utd 3-5 West Brom, 1978
The next game I remember very well our 5-3 defeat to West Bromwich at Old Trafford in 1978. Johnny, my pal and United cohort, decided for once to try the Stretford End, get in with the lads so to speak. It was a fantastic game full of goals, songs and mirth, and even though we lost, we all agreed we saw a great match and our future Captain Courageous, Bryan Robson, play their part for West Brom.
1984 Cup Winners Cup – Man Utd 3-2 Barcelona
In March 1984, we were 2-0 down from the first leg against Barcelona in the European Cup Winners' Cup. We arrived full of hope that we could overturn the deficit to progress to the semi finals. No Messi, Iniesta or Xavi, but there was Maradona, Schuster and Marcos Alonso. We took a flask of scotch to keep us warm on a cool September night. A couple of rows in front of us in the Cantilever was a Rastafarian who lit their jolly just before the game began. One guy near to them mentioned loudly to their friend, “Hey something smells pungent.” The Rasta turned to them smiling and replied. “Hey man, I paid twenty five quid for this ticket, I'm gonna enjoy it”.
After Frank Stapleton had scored the third and decisive goal for United, we all jumped and hugged each other with such an overwhelming feeling of euphoria. Needless to say, our flask vanished in the melee that ensued, but we were drunk on other spirits that night.
1999 Champions League Final – Man Utd 2-1 Bayern Munich
In May 1999, I was in Bangladesh on business. For each trip I made, as I had to travel for work, I made sure the hotels I stayed in had satellite TV. If not, I would scour the streets to find a café or hotel that did so I could watch my team.
At the Sonargoen in Dhaka, they thankfully had the game on in my room. With tired eyes at 1.30am, I watched the game unfold with growing regret that I had stayed up, only to see us lose to Mario Basler's goal in the first six minutes. However, in the dying embers of the game (and my lucidity), Sheringham deflected Giggs' shot into the goal to equalize in the final minute.
“Oh shit” I thought – extra time, penalties… I could be up for hours yet. Then, in the blink of an eye, a Beckham corner, a deft nod down from Sheringham and Ole prodded the goal in the German's net. As tired and drained as I was, I remember running around my bed, screaming in a whisper that we'd done it. I wanted to call my wife but I knew they would be asleep, so I sat in the room, shell-shocked, emotionaly drained but happy, and eventually fell asleep reliving those incredible moments.
These are just a few of the memories I have carried with me over the years. There are so many more, maybe you could share some of yours with us…

“You're very lucky that you've never been beautiful,” Kate Garraway recalls a school dinner lady telling them as a teen, “because it's given you the chance to develop a little personality.”
“It was both harsh and a little piece of genius,” the Good Morning Britain presenter decides all these years on. Harsh, presumably, because by anyone else's standards – and still now at 48 – Garraway has a face and figure to be envied by most women, and genius because they went on to hone a personality that has kept them on ITV's flagship breakfast show throughout all its incarnations for eighteen years, allowing them to interview everyone from the Prime Minister and Syrian refugees to Brad Pitt with equal ease.
“Of course TV is a visual medium,” Garraway shrugs, lilting slightly in the middle of a day that started at 2.15am and must end “before the News at Ten gongs or I start to panic.”

“And of course people expect you to have made an effort, but it's more about having a connection with the audience. I've worked with some of the most beautiful women in the world – many of them behind the cameras – so if it were about looks they would be on screen, not me. And I do feel lucky that professionally, I have always been treated exactly the same as a man.”
There can't be many women in TV able to make a similar boast. In twenty years on screen has Garraway honestly never encountered sexism? “I really don't think so,” they maintain. “But I have met women who say they absolutely have. And I've also met an awful lot of men in the industry who feel that they have seen women promoted above them and that there is inverted sexism going on.”
While they won't be drawn on this, Garraway does feel that in our ongoing quest for equality, women need to pick their battles (“I think we're all a little bored by the idea that men aren't allowed to open the door for us, aren't we?”) and be as fair as they're asking men to be.

“I've got a lot of girlfriends who would be furious if their husbands didn't load the dishwasher – but would never dream of lifting up the bonnet of the car. So women do need to start being fair. That said,” they point out, their warm, girlish features breaking into a smile, “I'm married to a man who never loads the dishwasher and whose family mantra – handed down from their grandfather – is: 'You don't keep a dog and bark yourself.' So maybe,” they go on with their trademark guttural laugh, “a few more battles need to be fought on my domestic front.”
Anyone who has ever met Garraway's second husband, Labour spin-doctor turned psychotherapist, Derek Draper – with whom they have a daughter, Darcey, 9, and son, William, 6 – will take this in the humorous way it's intended. And it's easy to see what the pair – who married in 2005 – see in each another.
Because although the Abingdon-born daughter of a civil servant and a teacher considers themselves a feminist, “especially now that sensible-thinking women have recaptured the term and made it less about tub-thumping”, Garraway has always been too busy pushing ahead to complain about the female lot. “Thanks to the many wars that have been fought and won by my mothers' generation, my daughter sees absolutely no difference between girls and boys. And in my view the biggest battles to be fought are taking place in other parts of the world.”
Derek Draper and Kate Garraway Credit: Alan Davidson
With the mythical cat-flights so enjoyed by the media back in the GMTV days now forgotten about, Garraway has been able to forge a close friendship with Susanna Reid, they say, without any talk of “competition.” “There was a point when it felt like no matter what Fiona [Phillips], Penny [Smith], Lorraine [Kelly] and I did, everyone was always being made to think that we hated each other. So we used to say to each other: 'Shall we just have a mud wrestling match in front of the building and lay it all to rest?'”
And, of course, I point out, it must be irritating that although male presenters are allowed to flirt as much as they like on screen, female presenters like Reid are often pilloried for doing the same. “Oh she's supposed to be a terrible flirt, isn't she?” Garraway chuckles. “But I constantly flirt with people on TV – in an increasingly desperate fashion. It's reached that point now though, where because of my age, nobody is at all threatened by it. When I interviewed Harry Styles I was doing my best to flirt whereas they were probably regarding me like a slightly odd aunt at a Christmas party.”
More urgent than these occasional double standards, Garraway feels, is a need to highlight the less 'sexy' issues they encounter every day at work. “People always ask about the movie stars I get to meet and of course they're fascinating, but it's the service personnel and veterans, or the mothers who have desperately fought to get something the rest of us take for granted for their child that really blow me away.”
For this reason Garraway has been devoting an increasing amount of time to charity work and is as happy to send themselves up in aid of Decembeard – a Beating Bowel Cancer campaign, raising money to provide practical and emotional help for those affected.  They are also training as a speech and language therapist for I Can – the children's communication charity they have chosen to support next year in their new role as President of The Television and Radio Industries Club.

“Communication is this forgotten thing in our kids' school curriculums, because everybody's very concerned with arithmetic and reading despite research telling us that children in deprived areas are coming to school unable to formulate sentences. Since I've made my living talking, I feel it's an area in which I might genuinely be able to help.”
With those energy-sapping early morning starts and so much time devoted to external projects, Garraway admits that they have to “watch the work and home balance.” “I always know when the balance goes wrong, because I'll be trying to do something with the kids at 7.30pm that I should have done at 5pm – and then there are tears and tantrums. But now they're older they both understand. And I think that most women are permanently torn between not feeling that they're being a good enough mother or employee.”
In 2016, their resolution is “to start exercising,” they tell me, “because right now it's really unpleasant when I'm naked – I mean really wobbly and horrible. And with 50 hurtling at me, I feel like it's time to get fit. Also,” they add slyly, “I've decided to embark on a bit of a journey. Fifty is this brand-new phase of life, so over the next year I'm going to talk to as many women of over fifty and as many psychotherapists, doctors and nutritionists as I can about how to prepare yourself mentally and physically for that decade.” Do I feel a documentary – Kate Garraway on How to Turn 50 – coming on? “Maybe,” they grin. And I hope she's serious. Because as far as templates go, she's not a bad one.

From fledgeling startup to “arguably the most important car company in the world”: that's how analysts at Morgan Stanley defined Tesla Motors Inc. in a research note published Wednesday.
In case anyone had any doubts, “we are not joking,” said the analysts, led by Adam Jonas. “Tesla is also emerging as an emblematic force in America's effort to foster high tech manufacturing job growth,” they added.
Here is Morgan Stanley's case for Tesla /quotes/zigman/118681/delayed /quotes/nls/tsla TSLA , in three broad themes:
Suppliers want to do business with Tesla
“We hear numerous examples of suppliers who once shunned Tesla who are now considering dedicated line and facilities only to supply [Tesla]”
Much-larger carmakers respect it
“A BMW engineer recently explained to us how Tesla's presence has helped invigorate the spirit of automobile innovation that was beginning to run stale, further testifying that BMW will be a stronger company longer-term because Tesla is around. Whoa.”
Five states are scrambling to have Tesla's $5 billion ‘gigafactory'
A governor “would need a very good reason to say no to a Tesla factory,” Morgan Stanley said. Sales forecasts plus a vertically integrated battery factory and charging infrastructure could imply Tesla directly employing 20,000 U.S. workers and indirectly behind more than 100,000 U.S. jobs in the next seven years, the investment bank said.
Moreover, Tesla's “Gen 3” car — aimed at the mass market and expected to hit the road around 2016 — will be the “most American-made car on the road,” pushing 90% U.S.-made components, more than a Ford F-150 or a Chevy Silverado, Morgan Stanley said.

In anticipation of all the games that would be released around the holiday season I am putting together a PC just for playing these games. It is equipped with all the latest hard- and software and with a big wide screen TFT to boot I am all ready to lock myself in my office for a few days and play until either my fingers or my eyeballs start to bleed. Like many others I kept my gaze fixed on the release schedules of upcoming games and would put in my online order the moment they were released. As such I now have all latest games installed but for one and that is the game I wanted to play for quite some time now: EA's Crysis.
So why haven't I ordered and installed Crysis just yet? Well, apparently EA is perfectly fine with me creating an online account at their US web store, however when I pull out my credit card or key in my PayPal account details, it refuses to let me download the game. For some reason I am denied access because I am physically located in Europe, hence I cannot buy from the EA US web store. As a result I am forwarded to EA's European web store where Crysis is not yet available for download to begin with and secondly, they jacked up the price from $49.99 to 54.99 euro, that is almost twice the price at current exchange rates.
Now I do not mind giving EA my money, but paying almost twice what US customers are paying is a bit much, and also something that rubs me the wrong way as it is simply against my principles. After all, we are talking about a digital copy here, not a carton box with a DVD, hence there is no localized box and no localized manual, just the same download that is offered through the US store. Sure, they may have thrown in a different EULA to comply with EU legislation, but that is it. So I am sitting here empty-handed, with a perfectly good credit card and enough money in my PayPal balance to make the purchase, but EA simply will not let me.
So despite the fact that I usually buy all my games, as I feel the developer needs to be rewarded for their hard work, I am just going to download Crysis off of a P2P network. Here is a big 'FU' to EA, if you do not want my money, but rather charge me double because I am not physically located in the US, you deserve to be pirated. When you come to your senses I will get my credit card out so I can reward Crytek, the developer, for their hard work. No other online download system has this limitation, for example I just downloaded the Orange Box of gaming bliss from Steam the other day without any issues. So a word of caution to all the publishers that feel compelled to rip off their customers in different geographic regions: don't, as people will simply download a pirated copy instead.

Donald Trump made a call for unity and praised the two Capitol Police officers who were on the scene after a gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice Wednesday morning.
In a statement delivered from the White House, the president confirmed that the gunman had died from their injuries.
“After 7 a.m. this morning, a gunman opened fire on members of Congress and their staffs as they were practicing for tomorrow's annual charity baseball game,” Trump said began. “Authorities are continuing to investigate the crime, and the assailant has now died from their injuries.”
“Steve Scalise, a member of House leadership, was shot and badly wounded, and is now in stable condition. At least two others were also wounded. Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of two Capitol Hill police officers who took down the gunman during a very, very brutal assault. Melania and I are grateful for the heroism and are praying for swift recovery of all victims.”
“Congressman Scalise is a friend, a very good friend. He's a patriot and fighter. Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city, but of an entire nation, and frankly, the entire world. America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting.”
“Our brave Capitol police perform a challenging job with incredible skill. Their sacrifice makes democracy possible. … Everyone on that field is a public servant. Our courageous police, our congressional aides, who work so tirelessly behind the scenes. We may have our differences, but we do well in times like this to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country.”
“We can all agree we are blessed to be Americans,” they added. “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good.”
Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives, is among the reported five people who were shot. They underwent surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center and is in stable condition, per their office.
The White House said Trump had spoken to Scalise's wife, their chief of staff and House Speaker Paul Ryan. (RELATED: Scalise Undergoing Surgery And In ‘Stable Condition' After Being Shot, Office Says)
The White House issued this statement from Trump earlier Wednesday morning: “The Vice President and I are aware of the shooting incident in Virginia and are monitoring developments closely. We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected.”
Trump also tweeted that though Scalise was “badly injured,” they would “fully recover.”
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2017
The suspect was identified as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, from Belleville, Ill.
"Forget everything you ever learned about how to carve a Jack-O-Lantern." This is how outdoorsy YouTube user Hickok45 starts this hilarious video tutorial on how to carve a pumpkin by shooting it. Just don't forget the part where you cut off the top and scoop out the seeds -- they did that in preparation for the lesson (probably also with a gun).
As is tradition, you might have thought the whole "carving the pumpkin" part was what made Jack-O-Lantern making such a hoot, but it's 2010. We have way more exciting and efficient ways of carving our pumpkins now, like with guns! Yeah, you probably shouldn't try this at home.
P.S. This guy also has a YouTube video called "Pumpkin Killing: 10 Methods That Work," so you can rest assured that they know what he's talking about (and that they really hates pumpkins). (Via Buzzfeed)
Thanks For the Requiems… [Monday Meeting Notes]
Monday Meeting
Well, looky there, it's the cover for Vampire: The Requiem 2nd Edition, featuring the Blood & Smoke Strix Chronicle. As we are getting ready the new PDF and physical book PoD files, I just want to remind everyone that already purchased a PDF of Blood & Smoke: The Strix Chronicle that we will be updating the B&S listing on DriveThru and updating your B&S PDF with this new VtR 2nd Edition PDF at no cost to you.
Additionally, at 12 noon EST on Wednesday, November the 19th, we will stop selling the PoD version of Blood & Smoke: The Strix Chronicle and will be replacing it with the PoD version of VtR2. So, if for any reason you didn't already get a B&S in physical book PoD form, you have until Wednesday at noon. After that we will be getting proofs of the PoD books, and once those are OK'd both the PDF and PoD versions of Vampire: The Requiem 2nd Edition will go live at last!
Our weekly meeting was mostly about the upcoming Wraith 20th Anniversary Edition Kickstarter (this week? maybe?) and the start of Pitch Season: that magical time of the year wherein we solicit pitches from our devoted developers and writers for projects. We're first getting in pitches from our line developers for cWoD, nWoD, and Exalted, and then we'll be asking those wacky writers. We also chatted about upcoming sales on DTRPG, and our con presence next year.
Lots of bits that led to talking about what currently we are thankful for in week three of our Month of Thanks:
– As per my lead-in paragraph, I'm super thankful that we are so close to getting out our first nWoD 2nd Edition, and I think Rose agrees on this one. Part of that is also being grateful that CCP was willing to re-examine the 2nd Edition idea and give us the green light for what I've considered for years to be a needed evolution of the lines. And we are actively working on nWoD 2nd core, Werewolf, Mage, and Promethean 2nds, and Changeling the Lost 2nd is revving up.
– I am grateful for the gang that meets every Monday to manhandle this crazy business into submission (or at least cooperation). Some employees, some consultants, some volunteers, but all pulling Onyx Path along, often by sheer force of will, a helluva lot faster and coherently than I could alone. And, in fact, a couple of them have some thanks of their own they'd like to share.
First, Eager Eddy Webb:
* Thanks for Onyx Path taking the risk on an owner/creator property like Pugmire. * Thanks for the V20 fans for continuing to show that open development doesn't have to be a train wreck. * Thanks to Kickstarter for providing a way to give high-quality deluxe books to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to get them (due to market forces).
– I also would like to thank Kickstarter in an abstract way, because it exists as a site, and a process, and without it we would certainly not be able to create the beautiful limited edition versions of our books we've been having so much fun with. But more specifically, I want to thank all of our Kickstarter project supporters, the newbies and the veterans, who rise up out of the darkness each time we do one and support the KS with what they can. In many cases, this has been a bumpy road, and I appreciate that so many of you have kept backing as we've developed more and better ways of making Kickstarter work for us.
And Maniacal Matt McElroy:
As a new Onyx Path Developer this year I'm thankful for the advice and
encouragement of experienced developers like Matthew McFarland, Justin
Achilli, Eddy Webb, and David Hill for showing me the ropes and
welcoming me to the team. I'm thankful for all of the teamwork from Rich, Mike, Rose, Ian, and
Monica (and now Lisa) for building Onyx Path each week. I'm also thankful for all the hard work of the freelance writers,
artists, and editors. Mostly, though, I'm thankful for all of the
enthusiastic energy and feedback from the fans because without them
these games wouldn't matter at all…
– So grateful for the wealth of projects we are currently working on. All three of the WW game lines, plus the system team actively working on our new dice-pool system for Scion and Trinity. (Working name The Sardonyx System. Yes? No?) Plus Scarred Lands gave me a chance to finally publish The Gauntlet of Spiragos adventure I wrote, and Cavaliers of Mars and Pugmire are in active creative discussions. Such a variety of Good Stuff, yet all of it has that certain spark that makes a project special.
And here is Mirthful Mike Chaney:
I'm thankful for the support of our fans in all of our publishing endeavors. Without that support we couldn't have done some really cool books like the Deluxe Hunters Hunted II, Prestige Edition Demon the Descent (so shiny it hurts), Deluxe Anarchs Unbound, or the Deluxe Mage with Lenticular Tarot Card (and tons of other upcoming cool stuff). I'm thankful that I am able to devote 100% of my creative energies to Onyx Path and it's various and expanding IPs. That has in turn given me the opportunity to design some truly awesome books (Vampire Dark Ages 20 and Mage 20) and expand the various ways we are able to deliver Onyx Path IPs. That's a very big thanks to both Rich and all the fans. I'm thankful we will be revisiting the Scarred Lands. I spent my first three or four years in production working on Scarred Lands and getting to revisit it is like seeing an old friend after a decade apart. I'm most thankful that despite two decades of various shenanigans, I still get to work with my friends making games that people still love to play. As of today, I'm at 260+ White Wolf or Onyx Path publications and I fully intend on making that 600+ one day.
– Like the Mirthful One, I'm also thankful that in a crazy world, I get to actually have fun at work with people I actually like, making these amazing and evocative games and books, and selling them to a community that loves them just as much as I do.
– Which brings us to all of you who read and post comments on this blog. I am grateful and somewhat humbled (no, really, it could happen) by your attention and commentary. Much like our Kickstarter community, and the eagle-eyed fans who post in our advance PDF errata threads, and the Open Dev blog posters, and the folks who review our projects online, and all the community that doesn't write much, but is out there supporting us – we couldn't do this without you. Angry or glad, impressed or disgusted, frustrated or thrilled, you let us know what is working with our crazy ideas and which are just plain crazy. Thanks, indeed! It's kind of weird to ask anybody here to contribute thanks as I feel like that's kind of asking folks to tell us how great we are, y'know? So instead please add in anything recently you're glad we did (or didn't do) if you have any thoughts in that direction.
And here are some thoughts and the direction is towards publication:

will release two more Limited Edition beers this year in cans, following up on its Foreign Style Stout, which debuted in a can in January, and Belgian Style Pale Ale, which came out in June. But both beers, Pumpkin Ale and Christmas Ale, will be in sixteen-ounce tallboys rather than twelve-ounce cans.

The Pumpkin Ale won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in 2011 in the Field Beer or Pumpkin Beer category (Turnip the Beets from Bull & Bush won the bronze).
At the time, Upslope founder Matt Cutter said that brewing a large batch of the Pumpkin Ale would be a logistical nightmare because the brewery makes it by sending pumpkins from Munson Farms home with all of its staff so they can bake them in their own ovens.
So, this year, Upslope will hire a professional kitchen to handle that job. The beer will be brewed on August 24, Cutter says, and should be packaged in mid-September.

Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz "has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."
A nasty-looking toxic algae bloom on Florida's coasts has oozed into political races, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Democratic primary.
Them opponent, Tim Canova, toured the mucky scene in Stuart wearing a surgical mask. They say that Wasserman Schultz shares in the blame for the algae that extends from Lake Okeechobee to Florida coastlines on the Treasure Coast and west coast.
Canova said Wasserman Schultz, who represents South Florida, has sided with the main polluters of the water that flows into the Everglades: the sugar industry.
Wasserman Schultz doesn't "want us to know that they have voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution," they said on Medium July 9.
Wasserman Schultz defended their environmental record to the Sun Sentinel, concluding, "I will continue to walk the walk on fighting to restore our precious River of Grass while my opponent just continues to talk."
Time for PolitiFact Florida to weigh in.
Algae and Big Sugar
Everybody agrees that the algae is bad for the environment and business. But they disagree on who is to blame.
Pollution from fertilizer, manure and septic waste from suburbs and farms poured into Lake Okeechobee. That pollution stimulated the growth of algae, so when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from the lake to avoid a breach of the surrounding dike, the algae-ridden water traveled to other waters in Florida.
Some politicians blame the federal government for the water release as well as its failure to raise the dike. Others blame the state of Florida for siding with the sugar industry and resisting calls to redirect water through sugar land.
In Florida, Big Sugar has given generously to state and local politicians and to federal candidates, including Wasserman Schultz.
"The sugar industry is completely ambidextrous as far as its ability to penetrate the Republican and Democratic camps," said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida.
Everglades delay vote
Canova's campaign points to Wasserman Schultz's vote in the state Senate to delay Everglades cleanup and to votes on two farm bills while in Congress.
In 2003, then state Sen. Wasserman Schultz voted to delay for seven years the requirement for sugar companies to clean up polluted discharges that had hurt the Everglades. It passed the state Senate 38-0 and the House 96-18, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law. The well-financed sugar industry fought for the delay, while environmental groups opposed it.
Two days later, Wasserman Schultz changed their vote to "no" because they said they were "betrayed and misled" about the facts. The Senate passed amendments that they believed were offered by the U.S. Justice Department but had actually been written by state environmental officials. Changing a vote is ceremonial only and carries zero practical effect -- except public relations.
Ryan Banfill, Wasserman Schultz's spokesperson, said that they initially supported the bill because it included a provision to buy sugar lands for filtration and was better than a 20-year-delay alternative.
Sugar votes in Congress
Canova's campaign also says Wasserman Schultz supported the sugar industry because of their votes to renew the 1981 Farm Bill in 2008 and 2014. The legislation is a sweeping bill that funds an array of nutrition and agriculture programs for multiple years.
So if Wasserman Schultz voted against the farm bill, they would have also voted against food stamps, assistance to food banks and economic development programs in rural areas such as providing broadband internet service. But if Wasserman Schultz had opposed the sugar portion of the bills they could have said so and they didn't, Canova's campaign said.
The farm bill gives lucrative benefits to the sugar industry. Specifically, it gives loans to processors and limits sugar imports to the United States. The government can also buy the surplus sugar and sell it for ethanol production.
These benefits amount to market controls that reduce the supply of sugar, thus making it more expensive, said Josh Sewell, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of the sugar policy.
The industry disagrees with the term "subsidy."
"A direct subsidy -- a check -- we do not get that," said Ryan Weston, executive vice president of the Florida Sugarcane League.
But Sewell said the price controls, marketing allotments and limits on imports are all government manipulations designed to provide an economic benefit to a set group and function as subsidies.
"Any governmental action that reduces the cost of doing business or increases prices beyond the normal functioning of a free market is a subsidy," they said. "In this case consumers, food manufacturers, and sugar producers outside of the United States are on the losing end."
The industry argues it needs the aid to compete globally with other countries that subsidize sugar and that the aid helps save jobs. Critics, including candy companies and consumer watchdogs, argue that it drives up prices for consumers and amounts to corporate welfare.
In recent years, there have been several national proposals by Democrats and Republicans to change the sugar program, but votes are rare.
In June 2013, however, the House and Senate voted on sugar amendments that would have scaled back the industry's benefits. The amendments failed in both chambers with Wasserman Schultz voting "no."
Most of the Florida delegation voted against the amendment, including both of Florida's senators Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat.
Banfill said Wasserman Schultz voted against the amendment because they said it would keep the market stable, protect American jobs and maintain the program allowing the government to buy and then sell surplus sugar to ethanol producers.
Lee, of Audubon Florida, says Wasserman Schultz isn't alone in their support of the federal government's sugar policy: "The same attack could be applied to virtually every member of Congress from Florida and it could be applied to virtually every member of the Legislature."
Banfill pointed to other efforts by Wasserman Schultz to clean up the Everglades and their 92 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters. They have supported a clean water rule proposed by the EPA and helped get the authorization included in the budget for multiple segments of the Tamiami Trail to restore natural water flow to part of the Everglades.  They are one of many cosponsors of the Central Everglades Planning Project that includes restoration projects but hasn't received a vote yet.
Those are all steps that could help the Everglades and the environment, but the sugar industry's benefits from the government remain in place.
"Yes, these positions were important and significant," Lee said. "However, these positions did not really challenge the sugar industry. On core issues for ‘big sugar' they have them support."
This is no different from every other major political leader in Florida, they added.
Our ruling
Canova said Wasserman Schultz "has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."
In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades. Canova omits that two days later they changed their vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway.
Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when they voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn't contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar.
Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup. But Canova's point about their specific actions is largely accurate.
We rate this claim Mostly True.

On September 17, 1939, the Soviet military invaded Poland. In response to the Nazi German onslaught of September 1, the Polish forces had already fallen back to the southern and eastern parts of the country. The Soviet invasion eviscerated what was left of Polish defenses. By October 6, the German and Soviet forces effectively controlled the entire country. Military intervention in Eastern Europe and mendacity from Moscow were the order of the day then, as they are once again today. Thus, it may be interesting to review the battle for history over the “secret additional protocol” that sealed the fate of Poland, among other states in the region.
The carving up of Poland had been planned in August of that year. On August 23, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop signed the Nazi–Soviet pact, a move that stunned the world and paved the way for Germany to invade Poland with impunity. While the main text of the pact was made public, a “secret additional protocol” was not publicized. This protocol said that Lithuania fell within the German sphere of influence but that the other two Baltic States and Finland were in that of the Soviets. It registered Germany's “complete political disinterestedness” in the Romanian region of Bessarabia. Also, it declared that “in the event of a territorial and political rearrangement of the areas belonging to the Polish state,” the spheres of influence would be divided “… approximately by the line of the rivers Narew, Vistula, and San” — German to the west and Soviet to the east.
Thus did the two great totalitarian powers of the period carve up Eastern Europe. Their actions were visible for all to see, but their collusion was deeply secret. However, when the Allies overran Germany in 1945 they captured vast quantities of German records including many from the German foreign ministry. Among them was the “secret protocol.” It was leaked to a member of the defense team during the Nuremberg trials. When they mentioned the document at trial, the Soviet prosecutor objected strenuously and the document was not introduced into evidence. However, somehow the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Manchester Guardian got copies and published them in May 1946.
The very next month, the United States and the United Kingdom agreed to cooperate on the Documents on German Foreign Policy (DGFP) project, which ultimately would last for several years and produce numerous volumes of selected documents. According to the agreement, the idea was to “forestall subsequent journalistic ventures or those of former Nazis that would be of a tendentious nature, and … most of all, demonstrate Germany's responsibility of [sic] the outbreak of the recent war.”
Research for the first volume in the DGFP series was completed in 1947. Clearly its subject was chosen with an eye toward the Cold War, which was already starting to cast a chill over the world. The volume was to be Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1939–1941. However, Secretary of State George C. Marshall postponed the publication of the book until they had a chance to meet with Soviet representatives and urge them to bring their policy on Germany more into line with the West's approach. When that failed, they gave the go-ahead. The book appeared in January 1948 and contained the explosive “secret protocol.” The Soviets were not amused. The Soviet response was that the book was anti-Soviet propaganda, that it reflected a discriminatory policy against the Soviet Union, that the USSR should have been given equal access to the documents, and that, in any event, the Western Allies had armed Hitler and tried to maneuver them into attacking the Soviet Union. In fact, in February 1948, the Soviet Union published its own book, Falsificators of History (in some editions it is Falsifiers), purportedly personally edited by Joseph Stalin, making this case. As for the “secret protocol” specifically, the Soviet Union publicly denied until 1989 that it ever existed. On December 23, just two days before Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as leader of the Soviet Union, they handed over to Russian President Boris Yeltsin a number of envelopes containing documents. They told Yeltsin, “I am afraid they can lead to international complications. However, it is up to you to decide.” The original Russian language text of the “secret protocol” was among these documents. Research over the coming months showed that every Soviet leader since Stalin had seen this and other key documents about Soviet policy toward Poland but they had all kept quiet. Yeltsin had the protocol declassified in 1992.
In 2008 Putin themselves denounced the 1939 agreement. More recently, however, the Russian line has been that the “secret protocol” never assigned territory to Germany or to the USSR and that the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of which they were a part was one of the “great achievements of Soviet diplomacy.” Putin themselves offered a defense of the pact at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May.
It seems, then, that Putin isn't satisfied to deny the facts of Russian actions in Eastern Europe today; they have decided to do so about those of three quarters of a century ago, as well.

Mark Cuban doesn't subscribe to the old exaggeration that if Charles Manson could get 20 points and 10 rebounds every night, he'd be signed by an NBA team in a heartbeat.
But they do believe that athletes – and people in general – deserve second chances, which is why they don't have a problem with the Cowboys signing of troubled defensive lineman Greg Hardy.
Cuban didn't think the Cowboys handled the situation correctly. But they don't have a problem with them bringing aboard Hardy – assuming they are taking proper steps to police him.
“I think they handled it wrong publicly,” Cuban said. “But I don't know all the details behind the scene. You can't just throw people away. What are you going to say about Greg Hardy? You can't ever get a job? The question is, is they working with a counselor? Are they going through support programs? Is there somebody there, if he's got a significant other, if they're working with them? And making sure they really are rehabbing himself.
“If a guy is an alcoholic, we'll work with him. If he's a drug-addict, we'll work with him. If a guy is in a hit-and-run accident, we'll work with him. If a guy has domestic abuse (problems), some people want to throw them away. And you can't throw your mistakes to the curb. At some point, somebody's got to take responsibility for him. So if what the Cowboys are doing is putting together a whole support team to make sure, then more power to them. They did the exact right thing.”
Last spring, Hardy was found guilty by a North Carolina judge of assaulting and threatening to kill their ex-girlfriend. The verdict was tossed when Hardy requested a jury trial and charges were dropped when the woman refused to cooperate with authorities after receiving a financial settlement from Hardy.
The Cowboys signed them to a one-year deal earlier this week.
Cuban was asked where the line should be drawn when dealing with athletes who run afoul of the law.
“The line is, can somebody be rehabbed,” Cuban said. “If somebody is rehabbable, you rehab them. If he's not rehabbable, then he's probably incarcerated because it's something that's going to happen again and again. That's why you have court systems.
“The onus is on them and the Cowboys, both of them. If you hire somebody that has a specific problem and you ignore that problem, then it's on you.”
Cuban was adamant that performance on the field is not something that will solely fix Hardy's problem. If they get 15 sacks this season, that's great. But it will take more.
“It depends on what they do off the field,” Cuban said. “If they make the same mistakes, it won't matter what they did. The NFL will throw the book at him. If they mind their P's and Q's and is a good citizen and a good spouse or whatever the case maybe, then everybody will say: ‘OK, they cleaned up their act.' America loves a second act and that's a good thing.”

Go's testing package side-effects
Problem
I've been working on a Go CLI app to push sensor data to Cloud™ and hit the problem.
In order to read the sensor data I had a very simple piece of code:
package main //analog_read.go import ( "flag" "fmt" "os" "github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/platforms/intel-iot/edison" ) var ( pin = flag . String ( "pin" , "" , "Sensor's pin-ID to read analog value from. Required." ) ) func main () { flag . Parse () if * pin == "" { flag . PrintDefaults () os . Exit ( 1 ) } var ed = edison . NewEdisonAdaptor ( "edison" ) v , err := ed . AnalogRead ( * pin ) if err != nil { fmt . Fprintln ( os . Stderr , err ) } fmt . Println ( v ) }
If the above code runs without pin flag specified then it dumps flag defaults prompting to specify the pin.
But instead of expected prompt:
$ go run analog_read.go -pin string Sensor's pin-ID to read analog value from. Required.
I got completely unexpected prompt:
$ go run analog_read.go -pin string Sensor's pin-ID to read analog value from. Required. -test.bench string regular expression to select benchmarks to run -test.benchmem print memory allocations for benchmarks -test.benchtime duration # # ... and many more #
Somehow flags from testing package got mixed into flags of my app. WTF?
Testing package
testing package is not intended to be used outside of *_test.go files(unless it's Ok to have side-effects the package produces).
If you look at its source code, it adds the flags I didn't expect to show up in my little CLI tool:
var matchBenchmarks = flag . String ( "test.bench" , "" , "regular expression to select benchmarks to run" ) var benchTime = flag . Duration ( "test.benchtime" , 1 * time . Second , "approximate run time for each benchmark" ) // etc
But why would those flags show up if no code imports the package? Well, because some other code import s the package!!?
Investigation
Luckily I had only single suspect to investigate: Gobot, because there's no other packages imported aside ones from standard library in my app.
Quickly grepping through Gobot's sources revealed what non-test code imports testing package:
gobot $ grep -nr '"testing"' ./|grep -v "_test.go" ./gobot/generate.go:317: "testing" ./utils.go:13: "testing"
where,
gobot/generate is not the offender as its "testing" is just a template string.
So, turns out gobot/utils.go (which is not a test) was import ing "testing" and causing problems. Apparently just to introduce test helpers Assert and Refute and enable other packages to re-use them.
Refactoring
Right solution for sharing code that imports "testing" package is to extract it into separate package( gobot/gobottest in this case), so only test code could import it.
Given the fact that a lot of tests depend on Assert and Refute helpers it was a good opportunity to use goftm as a refactor tool:
$ gofmt -r 'gobot.Assert -> gobottest.Assert' $ gofmt -r 'gobot.Refute -> gobottest.Refute'
Did the job and after moving helper code to the new package everything started working as expected!
Great Success!
Conclusion
Do not import "testing" package in your non-test code!
Media playback is not supported on this device Young SPOTY shortlist revealed
A shortlist of three contenders has been announced for the 2013 BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award.
Athlete Dina Asher-Smith, shooter Amber Hill and golfer Charley Hull are in contention for the prize.
They made the final cut, revealed on the Blue Peter television show, from a longer list of 10 candidates.
The winner, chosen by an expert panel, will be named during the 60th edition of the Sports Personality show, which is broadcast live from Leeds on Sunday.
Footballer Wayne Rooney, tennis star Andy Murray and diver Tom Daley are among previous winners on the roll of honour.
At 17, Asher-Smith became the second youngest female athlete in history to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships as Great Britain's women secured bronze in the 4x100m relay.
Aged just 15, Hill became the youngest winner of a senior World Cup in skeet shooting and finished the season ranked number one senior in Great Britain and number five in the world.
Hull, 17, joined the Ladies European Tour after turning professional this year and became the youngest golfer to appear for either Europe or the USA in the Solheim Cup.
The award is given to the outstanding young sportsperson of the year, who was aged 17 or under on 1 January 2013. The shortlist was created through a combination of nominations made directly to the BBC, and names of young sports people suggested to the Youth Sport Trust by governing bodies.
Previous winners 2012: Josef Craig - Swimming 2011: Lauren Taylor - Golf 2010: Tom Daley - Diving 2009: Tom Daley - Diving 2008: Ellie Simmonds - Swimming 2007: Tom Daley - Diving 2006: Theo Walcott - Football 2005: Harry Aikines-Aryeetey - Athletics 2004: Andy Murray - Tennis 2003: Kate Haywood - Swimming 2002: Wayne Rooney - Football 2001: Amy Spencer - Athletics
Footballer Adnan Januzaj, weightlifter Rebekah Tiler and canoeist Kimberley Woods were among those on the 10-strong contender list.
Athletes Jessica Judd and Isaac Towers also featured, alongside swimmers James Guy and Amy Marren.
Last year's winner was swimmer Josef Craig after they became Britain's youngest gold medallist at the 2012 Paralympics. Aged 15, they won the S7 400m freestyle final in a new world record.
The shortlist was compiled from the nominations of a panel of judges including Olympic triathletes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, 2001 Young Sports Personality winner Amy Spencer, BBC Radio 1's Tina Daheley, Blue Peter and MOTD Kickabout presenter Radzi Chinyanganya and Blue Peter Sport Champion Daniel Allen.
This year's Sports Personality of the Year awards night will take place on Sunday, 15 December and will be presented by Gary Lineker, Clare Balding and Gabby Logan in front of an expected 12,000 crowd at the First Direct Arena in Leeds.
In addition to the Young Sports Personality prize, there will be awards for:
Sports Personality of the Year
Team of the Year
Coach of the Year
Overseas Sports Personality
Sports Personality Diamond Award
Helen Rollason Award
Sports Unsung Hero
There is a desire among publishers to do for the PC what Xbox Live does for the Xbox and the Playstation Network does for the PlayStation. Everyone has a sense that digital distribution and/or social networking is the key to the future and that there is a great deal of money to be made in setting up shop early and securing your own share of the market, even before the market takes shape. Nobody is quite sure how games will be sold and played ten years from now, but they all know they want to be the ones running the community or selling the titles. We can already see this process at work. On the sales side we have platforms like Direct 2 Drive, EA Store, and Impulse. On the networking and matchmaking side we have things like Games for Windows Live and Gamespy. And then we have Steam, which does both.
Over a year ago, I predicted that the imitation of Steam would lead to a crazy mess where every publisher would have their own content delivery system for the PC, and every game would be linked to one. Remember how these systems usually work: The program sets itself up to run when Windows start, and it must be running if you want to play the game. If you follow this scheme to its logical conclusion, you'll see that the system tray of every gaming PC would eventually end up clogged with loaders, patchers, helpers, and monitors. Every publisher would have a program for serving up content, connecting players, managing digital licenses, performing patches, and (most importantly) selling stuff. Some people don't mind having "just one more" program running in the background. But what happens when you have programs from Valve, Stardock, Activision, 2k Games, Take-Two, Codemasters, Microsoft, Eidos, and Ubisoft? Sure, you could disable them. But then when you fire the thing up to play a game, it will want to spend fifteen minutes patching itself and the game before it will let you in. And imagine how fun it would be juggling accounts for all of them.
This was the horror I forsaw last year, but now I can see that no matter how pessimistic and cynical I get, the games industry is always one step ahead of me. While having lots of programs running at once is a terrible prospect, it is nothing compared to the nightmare of having multiple programs all connected to a single game. This Christmas I picked up Grand Theft Auto IV through Steam (in my defense: I knew the PC version was a train wreck, but it was super, super cheap) and I got a glimpse of the coming digital delivery spamocalypse. GTA IV ran under Games for Windows Live. But I don't know why, because as far as I could tell it didn't use any GFWL features. For multiplayer, it used the Rockstar Social Club. And all of this ran under Steam. Steam, GFWL, and Rockstar Social Club all have their own unique login systems, which means the game basically wanted three sets of login credentials. (On the other hand, only the Steam one is mandatory. On the other other hand, Social Club is a hateful, pestering bastard.)
What Happened to the $1.3 Billion Congress Approved to Improve Federal Gun Background Checks? The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was intended to improve lapses in state record keeping that have allowed dangerous people like Dylann Roof to get a gun. Here's why almost 90 percent of that money has never been spent.
Like many programs aimed at preventing bad behavior, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) only makes the news when it fails. Rarely has it failed more prominently than in the case of alleged Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof, who got their hands on a gun despite a disqualifying confession for drug use after spotty record-keeping allowed their Glock purchase to move forward on a so-called default proceed. This week, questions about the effectiveness of federal background checks have swirled again as journalists and investigators seek a definitive answer on whether Lafayette movie theater shooter John Hauser was involuntarily committed to a Georgia mental ward. If they are, that should have barred them from buying a gun – as long as the record made it into the system, which itself is far from a sure thing.
While critics argue NICS allows dangerous people to slip through the cracks, one architect of the program counters that the system is as good as the material it's got to work with. Frank Campbell, a former senior attorney for the FBI and the Department of Justice, was in charge of implementing the federal background check system created by the Brady Act of 1993 and managed the program from its launch until they left the government in 2008. Now working as a security consultant, Campbell says that the only obstacle to a fully-functional NICS system is getting fast, accurate access to local and state records, which are often inconsistent and sometimes still in paper files.
Congress agrees: Back in 2008, President George W. Bush signed a bill authorizing more than $1 billion in grants to improve local records reporting. What's got Campbell confused is why — if there's so much consensus around the idea that NICS would work better if states did a better job of reporting records to the FBI – almost none of the money authorized in 2008 has actually been released.
“There's been no publicly stated reason by Congress or the President why they ask for so little in their budgets,” Campbell tells The Trace. “It doesn't make any sense.”
This summer's mass shootings have provided indelible examples of the real-world consequences of these reporting gaps. Overall, 90 percent of background checks take less than two minutes to complete. But when the initial scan leaves the buyer's eligibility in doubt, the application is given a “yellow light,” and FBI examiners have three business days to track down the information that will resolve whether the sale should move forward; after that deadline, the purchase can go through whether or even if the background check remains incomplete. That's how a gun store was legally allowed to sell Roof the handgun they used to kill nine people in Charleston: An administrative error meant NICS investigators couldn't see the specifics of their local drug charge, pushing their background check past the time limit.
According to 2007 Congressional testimony by Campbell's colleague Rachel Brand, 3 percent of checks take the FBI's NICS division more than three business days to complete, and thousands never receive any determination at all. With 8.2 million background checks performed by NICS in 2014, even a small fraction represents a significant number of default proceeds: 228,006 checks exceeded the three-day period last year, resulting in at least 6,000 gun sales to buyers later found ineligible for firearms ownership.
In Campbell's words, there is one reason the FBI allows default proceeds: “There are certain local records that are not available to the system.” Each state has different standards for what records it keeps, how it keeps them, and what it sends to the background check system. Figuring out the dispositions of criminal charges sometimes requires getting a local court clerk to dig through physical files. Mental health and substance abuse records are often not reported at all, in any form, which has only deepened the puzzle of Houser's eligibility for gun ownership.
In total, Congress estimates nearly 21 million criminal records are not accessible by NICS, and millions more are incomplete. Given this patchwork of rules and resources, in some cases, it's nearly impossible for the Bureau to get a complete picture of who should be prohibited from buying a gun.
The NICS Improvement Amendment Act was intended to fix this. Introduced in the wake of the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre (the mental record of gunman Sueng-Hui Cho was also not accessible to NICS investigators due to state reporting practices) by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York, the bill quickly reached the desk of George W. Bush, and was signed into law early the next year. The legislation authorized more than a billion dollars in grants to states and territories to improve record keeping systems and reporting to NICS.
That seemed like a serious commitment to a robust background check system. But since the bill became law, Congress has given out only 11.5 percent of that money, even as authorization for the spending has been extended beyond the original timetable.
“Everybody knew what was going on — the NRA never wanted any records kept,” says former Congressman James Moran.
In 2009, the first year funds became available, the law gave the green light to $187.5 million in grants. Only $2.5 million was actually appropriated. Funding has significantly increased under the Obama Administration but still has never come close to the amounts called for by the bill, peaking in the fiscal year 2015 budget at $78 million before falling to $55 million in the President's 2016 budget request. Unused authorizations do not roll over, so funds not appropriated within one year's budget are no longer available.
“Some of the gun control groups thought the battle was over [when this law passed],” says former Congressman James Moran, a Democrat who represented Virginia's 8th District from 1991 to 2015, and served on the House Appropriations Committee. “But the insiders realized it didn't matter how much was authorized if the appropriations committee doesn't fund it.”
Former and present Hill staffers who spoke to The Trace on background felt the paltry funding level was a consequence of how the grants' eligibility criteria were written. Under the Act, states are required to have a “relief from disability” program, through which persons deemed ineligible for gun ownership due to mental health diagnoses or criminal records can petition for the restoration of their rights.
The provisions make some policymakers queasy: a well-publicized survey from the 1990s by the Violence Policy Center shows numerous instances of felons who received this relief and later committed more crimes. According to a 2015 Congressional Research Service memo obtained by The Trace, only 29 states allow relief from disability, with Connecticut eliminating its program after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. With such a large number of states therefore ineligible for NICS improvement grants, the argument goes, lawmakers don't prioritize the spending when appropriating federal dollars.
When this explanation for the low funding levels was put to Campbell, they didn't buy it. Each year since the passage of the NICS Improvement Act, at least three states and as many as seven have enacted relief from disability provisions. But despite the momentum that policy is enjoying, grant awards still fall short of what the bill called for.
A colleague who worked in the Department of Justice during Obama's first term told Campbell that under the current administration, NICS record improvement had “gone to seed.”
James Moran had a more political explanation for the parsimoniousness. Back in 2007, the NRA publicly applauded the Act for its relief from disability provision and the fact that it barred federal fees for NICS checks. It looked like a non-controversial way to better enforce current laws. But Moran says the NRA then turned around and worked with allies in Congress to cut off funding for these grants when the appropriations committee put each year's budget together.
“Everybody knew what was going on — the NRA never wanted any records kept,” says Moran. Keeping the background check system incomplete, Moran believes, allows the NRA to point to it as a failed system and rally against its expansion to private sales.
Knowing the NRA would excel in this backroom maneuvering, Moran says, moderates and Democrats didn't bother putting up a fuss over the grants issue. While those lawmakers may have agreed that states needed help completing records, Moran believes they also knew that “to fund this program, they'd be forced to take money from other areas.” And because messy appropriations fights take place largely out of public view, no one would know if they weren't willing to make that trade off. The original act's authorization provided political cover to everyone in Congress. “Having the appearance of action was an excuse for not doing other things,” Moran says.
Frank Campbell also believes the NRA's foes have let this issue languish: A colleague who worked in the Department of Justice during Obama's first term told them that under the current administration, NICS record improvement had “gone to seed.”
The NRA did not respond to request for comment on Moran's charges. The Trace contacted the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, as well as the White House Office of Management and Budget, to comment on the gap between money authorized to modernize and complete the background check system and what was actually dispensed. None replied.
Todd Tiahrt, a former Republican Congressman who represented Kansas' 4th district from 1995 to 2011, served on the Appropriations Committee alongside Moran and was known for their staunch opposition gun laws. Reached by phone, they made their opposition to NICS grants clear. Giving the states' money to modernize and send records to the FBI creates “a duplicate system to what the [federal] government is already doing,” they say. “Why would the states have to get involved?”
Update: An earlier headline (“Congress Is Sitting on More Than $1 Billion That Could Improve Federal Gun Background Checks”) has been changed to better reflect the mechanics of federal spending.

Extremist Israelis Disrupt Talks for Palestinian Nonviolent Leader In Paris
7:18 AM
A group of extremist Israeli youths, members of the outlawed Kach Movement, tried to prevent Palestinian nonviolent resistance leader, Abdullah Abu Rahma, from speaking at a forum in Paris, by creating chaos, acting in a violent way and trying to physically attack him.Abu Rahma, coordinator of the Popular Committee Against the Wall and Settlements in Bil'in village near Ramallah, was the guest speaker at the forum.
Fundamentalists interrupted their talk by breaking chairs while raising Israeli flags and by shouting and cursing at them while trying to physically attack him.
The extremists managed to disrupt the talk for approximately 30 minutes. Organizers of the Forum denounced the attack, especially since it is meant to suppress freedom of speech.
During their talk, Abu Rahma spoke of the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian people, living under Israeli occupation, losing their lands for Israeli settlements and the Annexation Wall, and subject to constant attacks by Israeli soldiers and settlers.
They called for isolating Israel and imposing sanctions on it until it recognizes the legitimate Palestinian tights of liberation and independence.
Abu Rahma is conducting a tour in Europe to talk about Palestinian nonviolent resistance against the Wall and settlements, and the suffering of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
They started their three-week tour two days ago in France, and will also be touring in the Czech Republic, Britain and Germany.
On March 14, Abu Rahma was released from an Israeli detention facility after being imprisoned for 15 months. They were kidnapped by the army in December 2009. Nine months later, an Israeli court “convicted” them of “incitement” and organizing and participating in the nonviolent protests in their village, Bil'in. They were acquitted of stone-throwing and weapons possession charges.
The army tried to accuse them of having weapons for exhibiting spent tear-gas canisters and rubber-coated metal bullets fired by the army at the local, Israeli and international peace activists conducting nonviolent protests in Bil'in.
Abu Rahma is a well-known Palestinian figure of the ongoing nonviolent resistance against the illegal Israeli Annexation Wall and illegal settlements built on Palestinian lands in the occupied territories.
Several Palestinians were killed while dozens of Palestinian, Israeli and International peace activists were wounded after being violently attacked Israeli soldiers who also fired live rounds at them.
Florida's Legislature Wants To Defund The Miami School Whose Alumni Made These
Grant Stern Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 28, 2017
All created by alumni of the New World School of the Arts.
It pains me to report that Miami's New World School of the Arts (NWSA) is facing a devastating cut in state funding, right as the alumni of the public school are starting to gain wide recognition for their artistic pursuits.
That's why I need you to make a phone call today.
The Florida House and Senate are meeting today, Friday April 28th to arm wrestle over the new State Budget.
NWSA's funding is not currently in that budget.
As an alumnus of NWSA, I can say that it was critical to my own career; the place where I honed learned many of the skills you see in my radio broadcasting and journalism today — and that all happened there while I attended school for singing.
“The Florida legislature created the New World School of the Arts 30-years ago,” says Patrick O'Connell, Chairman of the Board for the New World Foundation, which raises private funds which fund the school's operations.
“The state has provided critical funding to the school since then, and the whole world can see the results.”
Alumni of the Miami-Dade public school — run in partnership with Miami-Dade College and University of Florida — have recently been honored for their signature contributions to culturally significant works on the big screen, the stage and television with Oscars, Tonys, and Grammys.

Irish police officers colluded in the IRA murders of two senior Northern Ireland police officers, an inquiry has found.
Chief Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan were shot dead in an ambush in March 1989 in south Armagh.
The attack happened as they crossed the border into Northern Ireland after a meeting in Dundalk Garda station.
In the report of their inquiry, judge Peter Smithwick said they were "satisfied there was collusion in the murders".
Key findings Collusion: Peter Smithwick said that while there had been no "smoking gun" they were "satisfied" that there had been collusion by one or more Garda officers in the murders
Former garda sergeant Owen Corrigan: "I also find that what may have started out as a professional relationship with subversives for the legitimate purpose of intelligence-gathering ultimately developed into a relationship of an inappropriate nature"
Earlier investigations: O'Dea and Camon investigations were "inadequate"
Missed opportunity: "The best opportunity of establishing the truth of the matter arose in the days and weeks following the ambush. In these circumstances, it is particularly regrettable that both police services acted swiftly to dismiss speculation of the possibility of collusion rather than to deal with that by means of a through and credible investigation"
Culture: "The culture of failing adequately to address suggestions of wrongdoing, either for reasons of expediency or by virtue of misguided loyalty, has been a feature of life in this state" How the inquiry unfolded
Judge Smithwick said the circumstances suggested information was leaked to trigger the IRA operation, and the timing suggested it was "more likely that the information came from Dundalk Garda station".
They said the two police officers had arrived at the station no earlier than 2.20pm, and ten minutes later, the IRA had placed gunmen on the road where they were killed.
"This was as a direct result of confirmation having been received that the officers had arrived at Dundalk," they said.
They added: "Either the IRA did have an extraordinary piece of good fortune, or Harry Breen was the target of this operation. I believe that the evidence points to the latter conclusion.
"I also think that this makes it significantly more likely that the Provisional IRA knew that Chief Superintendent Breen was coming, and were not simply waiting on the off-chance that they might turn up."
The judge said they believed Harry Breen was the IRA's target, as after the killing of eight IRA men and a civilian in Loughgall, County Armagh, by undercover soldiers in 1987, they had been pictured with weapons recovered by police.
'Political expediency'
"There was, in the wake of the murder, triumphalism in relation to the fact that the Provisional IRA had killed the officer who had appeared in that photograph 'etched in every republican's mind'," they wrote.

They found that the IRA needed positive identification that Mr Breen in particular had arrived at the police station in Dundalk, and this positive confirmation would likely be from a member of the Garda.
'No smoking gun'
"Given that I am satisfied that the evidence points to the fact that there was someone within the Garda station assisting the IRA, it also seems to me to be likely that the Provisional IRA would seek to exploit that resource by having that individual or individuals confirm the arrival of the two officers," they said.
Timeline of events 20 March 1989: RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan are murdered in an IRA ambush in south Armagh on their way home from a meeting at Dundalk Garda station.
November 1999: Journalist Toby Harnden alleges in their book Bandit Country there was collusion between the IRA and Garda X and Garda Y in Dundalk
13 April 2000: MP Jeffrey Donaldson uses parliamentary privilege in the Commons to allege Garda X is former Dundalk garda Owen Corrigan
October 2003: Retired Canadian judge Peter Cory recommends setting up of a tribunal of inquiry into the Breen and Buchanan collusion claims
May 2005: Tribunal established by the Irish government to be chaired by judge Peter Smithwick
March 2006: Private investigation phase begins
7 June 2011: Public hearings begin in Dublin
The report is also critical of two earlier garda investigations into the murders, which it describes as "inadequate".
The judge said it was "highly regrettable" that the most senior police officers on both sides of the border dismissed speculation of a mole in the immediate aftermath of the killings. They said this was "political expediency" at the expense of the victims.
They said the culture of failing to adequately address suggestions of wrongdoing, either for reasons of political expediency or by virtue of misguided loyalty, has been a feature of life in this state.
They concluded that "too often that culture has resulted, some years later, after doubts, grievances and injustices have festered, in the setting up of investigations, commissions or tribunals of inquiry".
They said they hoped their report would contribute in "one small part to changing that culture".
Judge Smithwick said there was "no smoking gun" and it was not surprising that the tribunal had not uncovered direct evidence of collusion.
Bob Buchanan's son, William, said: "The findings of Judge Smithwick are both incredible and shocking, and confirm the existence of a mole in Dundalk station - this led to my father's death."
Smithwick definition of collusion "While (collusion) generally means the commission of an act, I am also of the view that it should be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act. "In the active sense, collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire, connive or collaborate. "In addition I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter, or turned a blind eye to it, or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, legally or officially oppose."
A solicitor speaking on behalf of Chief Supt Breen's family said the report was "a truly remarkable exposé and indictment of wrongdoing and collusion with terrorists by some within An Garda Siochána".
The family said the report detailed in the most stark and dramatic fashion the failure by state systems to address these matters year upon year.
Irish Justice Minister Alan Shatter apologised "without reservation" for the failings identified in the report.
"Even with the passage of 24 years and the positive developments which have taken place on the island since, our condemnation of their murder should be as strong today as it was then," they said.
Mr Shatter said nothing in the report should detract from the good work of An Garda Siochána during the Troubles.
Their counterpart in Northern Ireland, David Ford, said the suggestion of garda collusion was "no different from the suggestions in the past of one or two RUC officers behaving inappropriately".
"The important issue is that fundamentally the two organisations are good police services, they now work together in a extremely good way," they added.

The publication of the report on Tuesday follows almost eight years of painstaking investigations.
The Dublin-based tribunal was established by the Irish government in May 2005 and began its private investigation phase 10 months later.
Public sessions began in June 2011, hearing from hundreds of witnesses including police from both sides of the Irish border, IRA members, undercover agents and politicians.
It had been recommended by retired Canadian judge Peter Cory, as part of their report on several controversial killings presented to the British and Irish governments in 2003.
ARPA-E, the government's incubator for high-risk energy inventions, has its first graduate in the electricity area — a new energy storage technology — and on Thursday it announced a preliminary agreement to get it tested.
The agency, more formally the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy, modeled after the Defense Department's longstanding program, said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Duke, the big utility company, and the Electric Power Research Institute, the nonprofit utility consortium, to try out the inventions in the real world.
The agreement will “provide the connective tissue for ARPA-E,'' said Arun Majumdar, the agency's director, and “provide the test bed to see how to create value in the actual business.''
The first candidate will probably be General Compression, a company to which ARPA-E directed $750,000; that advanced the technology enough for the firm to raise $12 million privately, Mr. Majumdar said. The company developed a way to pump air into an underground cavern, using electricity generated at inconvenient hours. When the energy is needed, the air flows back out again through a generator.
An older technology accomplishes this by adding natural gas to the exiting air and burning it to spin a turbine; General Compression uses no fuel at all. Its “round-trip efficiency,” meaning the amount of energy delivered versus the amount it takes in, is 70 to 75 percent, the company says.
Energy storage is considered a crucial complement to wind power and possibly solar power as well, smoothing out production and ensuring that the energy is available when it is most valuable, but today's systems are expensive and thus are not in wide use.
Mr. Majumdar said that ARPA-E hoped the air compression technology can be scaled big enough to store a gigawatt-hour, equal to the entire output of a large nuclear plant for an hour. Price is a crucial consideration, and ARPA-E has determined that a utility could probably afford to pay $100 per kilowatt-hour of storage.
(A kilowatt-hour would run a microwave oven for an hour or so. It sells for an average of 10 cents nationally, but the price can vary from nearly nothing to 50 cents or $1, depending on the market. While $100 sounds like a lot to store a commodity worth 10 cents, the storage could be used over and over again.)
ARPA-E came up with the $100 estimate on its own, Mr. Majumdar said, but “in the future there may be other metrics we don't know.” The partnership will help the agency figure that out more easily, they said.
Another early candidate for field trials may be semiconductors that can function as transformers, raising and lowering voltages, they said. ARPA-E has been operating on a one-time infusion of cash from the stimulus program, but the recently negotiated budget deal in Congress included $180 million. “We're absolutely delighted to get our first appropriated budget,'' Mr. Majumdar said.
An earlier version of this post misstated the given name of ARPA-E's director.  They are Arun Majumdar, not Arjun.
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For
The Short- Nearly Ten years removed from the original, Sin City piles on the gore and nudity but has a distinct lack of the substance of the first film. It doesn't help that the timeline where this movie takes place to the original is unrecognizable. Characters who died in the first film are back, and a number of original cast members have been replaced, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is about 5 years too late and doesn't have very much to add in the form of new material.
This review will contain spoilers to the original Sin City, if for some reason you are reading this before you watch either movie then read no further.
Sin City hit theaters hard in 2005 and a sequel has been 9 years in the making. I'm not saying waiting 9 years to make a sequel is a bad idea but when the film takes on 3 different stories that at some point come together it's difficult to allow the viewer to understand where this movie connects with the previous film. At the end of Sin City, Mickey Rourke's practically iconic brawler Marv meets their demise. So it was sort of a shock to not only see Rourke return for the sequel but to have them in the whole film. It is sadly this problem that was the demise of Sin City A Dame to Kill For.
In the sequel to the wonderful 2005 noir we follow Dwight (Josh Brolin taking over for Clive Owen), Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) and Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as they traverse the back alleys and bars of Basin City. Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller weave in and out of each characters story throughout the film, beginning with Johnny, a skilled gambler who enters into a dangerous game of poker with Senator Roark (Powers Boothe), after cleaning Roarke out, Johnny is caught off guard when the corrupt politician begins to take their revenge for the embarrassment. The next story is Dwight, a PI who is having an on again off fling with Ava (Eva Green and the titular Dame) who has the gruff Dwight wrapped around their finger thanks to claims to be in a violent, abusive marriage. There is a very little of Ms. Green that you do not see during this film's 1 hour and 45 minute run time.  They are naked in practically every scene they appear in and the sex scene(s) border on pornographic. Green's performance is not as memorable as the filmmakers would have liked being that they go in and out of an American accent throughout, and unlike their scene stealing performance in the 300 sequel from earlier this year they lack that quality in their performance of really embodying a character. The third and final story in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is Nancy Callahan, the stripper played by Jessica Alba who is struggling with the death of John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who appears as a ghost a few times and their seeing them that drives Nancy to seek revenge on Senator Roark. Alba is forced to do a lot more in this film and they are incredibly campy but looking passed the camp you won't hear many people speak highly of their acting ability. They remain unconvincing as they begin to seek their revenge, it's never for even a moment a believable portrayal even in a ripped from the pages movie based on a graphic novel.
Sin City had a punch to it that was totally lacking from A Dame to Kill For, both films are beautiful to look at especially at times when horribly violent things are occurring but any attempt to add something new to the film was somehow taken away. Instead the same beautiful effects and shots from the original are there to stay. The 9 year wait may have originally been seen as a tool to make a similar movie with a new cast and stories but it's a deterrent that had me begging for something new and only getting the same old stuff. The one thing these films have done very well is never stray too far from the source material, keeping all the R rated things in the film was a big step in that direction but keeping the dialogue campy will annoy people who have never opened a Sin City graphic novel but they do bring that comic flair to the film.
Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is too little, too late, a sequel to a wonderfully entertaining film that just feels like old news. Nothing is as impressive or as fun in A Dame to Kill For and the added effect of more violence and more nudity comes off as forcing the issue. In Sin City everything felt a little more organic, like the beautiful effects and action sequences were not thrown it but occurred as part of the story. A Dame to Kill For has all the dirt and grime of the first film but is never worth the watch. It's never a good sign when the most memorable part of sitting in the theater to see this movie was the teaser trailer for Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight.

08/09/2012I precisely deseird to thank you very much yet again. I do not know the things I would have gone through without the type of ways discussed by you about that field. It truly was an absolute intimidating problem in my opinion, however , being able to see the very expert mode you resolved the issue took me to weep over happiness. I am happy for your information and then hope that you know what a great job you have been providing training the others using a site. I am sure you haven't got to know all of us.
19/09/2012I think that a property fourclosree can have a important effect on the borrower's life. Real estate fourclosrees can have a Several to 10 years negative influence on a client's credit report. A new borrower who has applied for a mortgage or any loans even, knows that the actual worse credit rating is, the more complicated it is to acquire a decent bank loan. In addition, it could possibly affect the borrower's capacity to find a decent place to let or hire, if that results in being the alternative houses solution.

Rick Perry, you know that Texas guy that's trying to get the Republican nomination for President, well apparently he's more hated than Rebecca Black if you can believe that - at least on YouTube that is.
For quite a while now, the Rebecca Black train wreck song "Friday" was the most hated song on YouTube with more than a quarter of a million "dislikes." But now the fortunate Governor of Texas has taken that title away from Black with their latest video "Strong" where he's shaming the country for allowing Gays to serve in the military.
In the video, Perry is trying to look all cowboyish by wearing a tan coat and walking through the woods and lambasting the country by saying there's got to be something wrong when gays can serve openly in the military and kids can't celebrate Christmas in school. As of this posting, Perry's video has more than 355,000 dislikes, far eclipsing Blacks mere quarter of a million - and Perry was able to do it in only a few days where it took weeks for Black to get that distinction.
Here's a screen cap:
Oh, and who ever was in charge of their wardrobe for the commercial sure went to great lengths to make sure that they were wearing a coat very similar to the one that the late Heath Ledger wore in that gay classic - Brokeback Mountain.
Yeah - he's totally not gay!
@PeridexisErrant: Sweet. That editing blueprints page is exactly what I needed. It looks like multilevel designations will be pretty trivial, it's just a matter of figuring out how to do the UI, which is probably the opposite of trivial. But I'm sure I can work something out.
@Astarch: It's an arbitrary limit. I noticed a slowdown in the UI with unlimited colors. Also, 24 bit images are supported. It's just that when you have less than a full 8 bytes per color (ie. 16 bit and lower images), you have to change the algorithm for the color selection of each pixel, which IMO is more effort than its worth to implement, because seriously, who is really going to need the space savings of creating a 16 bit image vs 24 bits?
IIRC (I don't have the source handy, as I mentioned before I'm still on vacation) .NET has a pixelcopy function which stores the image as a byte array with each pixel as 4 bytes of RGBA (or ARGB I don't recall which) or if there is no alpha channel 3 bytes of RGB -- which are converted to a hexadecimal value which is used for doing all the heavy lifting. Additionally there is a function which automagically creates a list of colors from the image palette which dynamically generates the designation inputs.
In retrospect the color limit is a poor workaround for the actual problem. I was trying to protect people from loading jpgs of millions of colors and freezing the program. While testing I opened up some random .jpg of blood soaked icebergs and polar bears and figured someone out there would accidentally do something similar with their pictures of cats or boobies or whatever else they may have handy. I can probably increase the limit on colors, and also add a limit for the image dimensions, 2 or 3k square pixels maybe?
edit: also, thanks for the link. I actually just saw your program while searching for more information about quickfort earlier today on the forums, and I've added it to my list of things to look at when I get back home.
Clinton releases ad focused on Trump's tax returns
Donald Trump doesn't appear to have any plans to release their tax returns — and Hillary Clinton apparently isn't going to let up on him.
On Thursday, the Democratic nominee released a 30-second TV ad that featured an old clip of Trump saying he'd “absolutely” release their returns if they ever ran for office and Republicans speculating on what could be hiding in Trump's returns.
“If I decide to run for office I'll produce my tax returns — absolutely,” Trump says at the beginning of the ad.
The ad then has the word “Now?”
ABC's George Stephanopoulos asks, “What is your tax rate?”
Trump responds, “It's none of your business.”
The ad then plays clips of Republicans speculating on what could be inside Trump's returns.
The Republican nominee has said that they won't release their returns while they're under audit. There are no regulations that prevent them from doing so, and their running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has indicated they would release their tax returns.
Last week, both Hillary Clinton and their running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, released their returns in an attempt to pressure Trump to do the same.
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee announced Thursday it would be sending "Donald ducks" to a series of Trump events. The duck went to Trump Tower on Thursday and will be at Trump rallies in the following days.
In a release, the DNC said the character was set to call out Trump for "constant ducking on their taxes." But the DNC isn't the first one to play off Trump's first name; it is a bipartisan affair. During the primaries, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released a snapchat filter that featured "Ducking Donald" based off Trump skipping a debate.

For more than 30 years, wastewater from oil and gas operations has been used to irrigate food crops in California. Regulators will re-examine the safety of that practice during a public hearing Friday.
Four oil companies in the state currently send oil field wastewater to four irrigations districts. Once treated, it's then recycled and used on food crops, primarily in Kern County.
To date, no studies have shown that irrigating crops with oil wastewater poses any threat, says Clay Rodgers, with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board.
"If evidence comes available to the regional board that indicates that there are issues associated with the use of this water, then certainly we will take quick measures to address those concerns and mitigate any impacts,” says Rodgers.
Environmental advocates say oil field wastewater could contain toxic chemicals that can cause cancer or reproductive harm.
Dr. William Stringfellow with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has conducted an independent study on chemicals used in oil production.
“There's nothing particularly at this moment that's a smoking gun type of information that suggests that anything unsafe is occurring," says Stringfellow. "But there's enough questions coming up that it's worthy of further investigation.”
The study did not look at chemicals in treated water that end up on food crops, but instead looked at chemicals used in oil production. They say it's difficult to estimate risks to consumers when oil companies don't disclose chemicals they consider trade secrets. Oil companies also don't disclose the amounts of chemicals used in extracting oil.
The water board says it will consider banning the practice if it's deemed a public health threat.
Donald Trump launched a new war on terror last night and vowed to eliminate Islamic State 'from the face of the earth'.
But their bold declaration to 'eradicate completely' radical Islamic terrorism was at odds with their inauguration speech's 'America First' inward-looking agenda.
And it was not clear how Mr Trump and their advisors plan to succeed without jeopardising international relations and running up huge costs on military operations.
President Donald Trump delivers their inaugural address after being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States
While they have previously promised a more effective military campaign than that of Barack Obama, many of the actions they might take to accelerate progress in Iraq and Syria come with potentially dangerous side effects.
Those include the deterioration of already strained ties with NATO ally Turkey, an increase in American or civilian casualties and reinvigorated militant recruitment.
It is extraordinary, given the tentacles of the terror group extend across Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Tunisia and Libya, as well as parts of France, Belgium, Italy – and Britain.
Sceptics were also quick to point out that several past presidents, most notably George W. Bush, had failed to keep similar promises to beat terrorism. Yet in their speech, Mr Trump threw down the gauntlet to Islamic State and its supporters around the world.
They said: 'We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilised world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.
'We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.'

They have said that on taking office, they will tell their top generals they have 30 days to present them with a plan for defeating IS.
Later, their administration expanded on the plans to defeat terrorism.
A statement on the White House website said: 'Defeating ISIS and other radical Islamic terror groups will be our highest priority. To defeat and destroy these groups, we will pursue aggressive joint and coalition military operations when necessary.
In addition, the Trump administration will work with international partners to cut off funding for terrorist groups, to expand intelligence sharing, and to engage in cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable propaganda and recruiting.
'Next, we will rebuild the American military. Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016. Our Air Force is roughly one third smaller than in 1991.
'President Trump is committed to reversing this trend, because they know that our military dominance must be unquestioned.

The world will be more peaceful and more prosperous with a stronger and more respected America.'
They also pledged to 'reinforce old alliances' in a sign that Britain's special relationship with the US could be boosted under their leadership. In response, Theresa May said they were certain Mr Trump intends to advance links between Britain and the US. They said: 'I congratulate President Trump on taking office today.
'From our conversations to date, I know we are both committed to advancing the special relationship between our two countries and working together for the prosperity and security of people on both sides of the Atlantic.'
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson voiced their hopes for the continuation of the special relationship as they congratulated Mr Trump.
They tweeted: 'Look forward to continuing strong UK-US bond.'

This morning, I walked into the activity room here at St. Anne's, only to find the branches from my inherited Jesse Tree sprawled out on one of the tables.
It was only about 8 in the morning but Shelly, our activity director was hard at work.
They were cutting out new branches to replace the old ones which they had noticed were faded.
Amidst teasing about the shade of green they were using, and whether or not to put on glitter, I found that they had bribery in mind. They were “doing something nice for me,” knowing that they needed my help with a different project.
I assured them that I would have helped them with their task without any bribery (and I am sure they would have helped me without any ulterior motive either).
All that being said, the two of us worked together to get the new branches ready for the felt tree, where we would be putting them during our annual Jesse Tree service at Bible study.
This little service, commemorating many key parts of salvation history, is really quite nice. In fact, we have decided to use it for our Wednesday evening community discussion night.

PS: Thank you, Shelly, for your horticultural contributions to our Bible Study!

Yoga studios have become places of bustling activity. A space that normally caters to quiet time and personal reflection, now also acts as a social venue. While it's nice to have a community space for practitioners to gather, there are some best practices that can help maintain a sacred atmosphere that caters to your personal practice.
1. Dress Appropriately
As the popularity of yoga has increased, so have the clothing options—some brands focusing more on fashion than function. While some yoga clothing is fun, it may not be practical or appropriate for class. The low-rise yoga pants may be adorable in the store but pay attention to how they'll feel in child's pose, down dog, or while doing inversions. Test your yoga clothes at home with a mirror and make sure they are as functional as they are fashionable.
2. Show Up on Time
Yoga is a time to honor your mind, body, soul, and spirit. It's the one time in the day or week where you can let the demands of everyday life fall away while you get lost in practice. Don't shortchange yourself by showing up late. Out of respect for your instructor and your fellow students, arrive on time or a few minutes early. The same rule applies to leaving class early. Unless if you have an emergency, stay until the end of class. Savasana or relaxation at the end is, after all, the best part of yoga.
3. Mind Your Scent
While yoga is about being your authentic self, your au natural scent may not be welcome in a crowded yoga room. For the sake of your fellow practitioners, please wear deodorant and/or antiperspirant. On the flip side, also be aware of wearing strong perfume. Many people are sensitive to or may be allergic to certain scents.
4. Share the Space
While yoga is a very personal practice, it's also a group activity. Make room for your fellow yogis and move over your mat if a student needs a spot, and show compassion if someone comes in late. If someone else disrupts the class, use it as an opportunity to practice staying centered in the midst of commotion.
5. Go for the Right Reasons
Yoga classes can be a great place to make new friends and meet new people, but that shouldn't be your primary reason for going. If you stay rooted in your practice and find the peacefulness within, authentic relationships will follow.
6. Don't Compare Yourself to Others
Everyone comes into yoga practice at a different level and each person progresses at their or their own pace. You might never achieve a full lotus but can do a perfect boat pose. Your neighbor might be able to balance in crane but can't do boat. Try to steer clear of comparisons or judgments—of yourself and other. If you need help turning your attention inward, try closing your eyes.
7. Spread Good Karma
Help keep the yoga studio tidy by performing selfless acts before and after class. You might clean up the yoga props, smile at the new student or give them words of encouragement, or ask your instructor if they need help setting up. Make sure your belongings are in a locker or cubby space so someone else has space to set out their mat. Believe it or not, all of these kind gestures can help you advance in your practice.
8. Let Your Body Completely Relax
Believe it or not, releasing a little wind is completely normal in yoga. In fact, there's a pose called “the wind-relieving pose.” Yoga poses are designed to keep every part of your body healthy and vibrant. So if you pass a little gas from time to time, there's no need to be embarrassed. If it happens, just move on with your practice. It's not as if it's never been done before.
9. Leave Your Cell Phone Outside the Room
You can't truly devote yourself to practice if you have texts, tweets, and Facebook comments popping up on your screen. Think back to the days before cell phones and go old school. If you want your spouse or children to be able to reach you in case of emergency, give them the number of the studio where you will be.
10. Keep an Open Mind
Every yogi has a favorite teacher. You might be used to the way they conduct class or maybe you like their soothing voice. But don't close yourself off to new or substitute teachers. A yoga practice is about expanding your mind and increasing your awareness. Even if you're disappointed when you don't see your favorite teacher, keep an open mind and heart. Tell yourself you will learn at least one thing from this new teacher. You may find that, at the end of the class, you have learned much more.
Don't be like Wolverine. Drink responsibly.
Throughout history, humankind has always found reasons to add booze to everything, under the auspices of somehow making it classier. Eventually, people figured out how to use these seemingly tangential excuses for drink as a means of complementing and enhancing their experiences. Drinking wine? For shame! Wine and cheese? Perhaps a side of delicious red steak? Now we're talking! Drinking in the morning? Forbidden! Orange juice in your cocktail at brunch? Fantastic and socially acceptable! Even in a recession, when people are cutting corners and forced to find new ways to be frugal – everyone still likes to drink.
The point is, drink pairings are classy. And in a world where comic books are finally seen as “cool,” why not add class it up some more? Comic books are an event, after all. I guess what I'm trying to say is this all just a clever ruse for me to combine two of my biggest passions into one delectable event. Comics and Beer – the perfect combination. But like wine and cheese, the real trick is in finding a brew that will somehow improve upon your comic book affair. One that accentuates the proper tones, and enriches the flavor – a beer that you can experience along with your comic book. A beer that betters your comic book, and a comic book that betters your beer, all at the same time.
Here's a brief guide to pairing your Comics and Beer:
Captain America: Captain America is, well, American. That's kind of the point. But not in that corporate, militant, bully nationalism-type way. Cap stands for the American ideal, something that everyone can agree with and get behind, that's not colored by politics and money. That's why you'll want to go for a microbrewed American-style lager or pale ale. Something clean, palatable, and easy to drink, something that everyone can agree on but is still wholly American. I'd personally recommend Brooklyn Lager (after their home turf after all), or Sam Adams Lager, or something similar.
Daredevil: The Man Without Fear is, of course, blind, but the rest of their senses are heightened and more than compensate for this. India Pale Ales (IPA) are flavorful and aromatic, thanks to an abundance of hops (historically added to act as a preservative so that English ales might survive the long trip to India). As a result, they engage the senses more than the average beer, and will encourage you to rely on more than just sight, like Daredevil himself. IPAs are also known for their bitterness, and as anyone who's ever read a Daredevil comic can attest, bitterness and aguish run rampant in the life of Matt Murdock. The higher alcohol content will make your head spin, much like the conspiracies and ninja smoke that Murdock faces himself. Recommended for the uninitiated: Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, Mojo IPA, Harpoon IPA.

Spider-Man: Spidey's not much of a drinker (except for that one time they got wasted on 2 beers at Aunt May's wedding and almost hooked up with their roommate before blacking out), so this is a tough one. But to complement Spider-Man's innocence and playful nature, I'd recommend you go for a hard cider, such as Magners, Strongbow, or Woodchuck (Harpoon also makes one of which I am particularly fond). They basically taste like sparkling apple juice (something that Peter Parker would definitely drink), but with the added bonus of giving you a slight buzz (thank of it like your very own personal spider-sense). Plus, ciders are refreshing – an excellent end to a hard day of web-slinging.
Iron Man: Dude. Seriously? That's not funny. Tony's an alcoholic. (But if you were to drink something along with your Iron Man comics, I'd recommend something classy and foreign, like a Chimay. Or go all the way like Tony themselves with some red wine or a nice bottle of scotch. But you're still an insensitive jerk.)
Ghost Rider: Rogue Dead Guy Ale. *rim shot on the drums*
The Hulk: For a Hulk comic, you're going to want something strong. Something that gets you smashed. And possibly a little angry. Isn't that what The Hulk is all about? I'd recommend a barleywine – Brooklyn Brewery's Monster Ale might be the best and most obvious option. Something (very) high in alcohol, with an almost sickly sweetness to counteract the bitter, chewy tastes. (and remind you of the human innocence within the Monster. Or something. I'm sure there's a metaphor in there somewhere.) You could also go for a Russian Stout, such as Rasputin's, which also has a sickly, albeit cough syrup-esque sweetness in otherwise dark and heavy brew (although this might be better paired with one of the Hulk's adversaries such as the Abomination or the Red Ghost).
Wolverine: Labatt Blue. For one thing, it's Canadian, and has that crisp, refreshing Canadian flavor (whatever that means). For another, you can drink a lot of these, and feel neither too full, nor too drunk, just like Wolverine himself! Except, you don't have a mutant healing factor, or an adamantium skeleton, nor were you the unwilling test subject of a government super-soldier experiment. So not like Wolverine at all. But enjoy the beer!
X-Men: This is a very broad category, as there are a lot of X-Men among the different teams (approximately 198 at current, thanks to the Scarlet Witch). Rather than break them down by individual or team (which I could very easily do, but it would take a while, and I don't think you want to read about which beers pair best with Chamber, or Longshot), I would recommend that you pair your X-Men comics with any variety of brews for the Dogfish Head Brewery.
Dogfish Head's slogan touts them as “off-centered ales for off-centered people,” and, well, what's more off-centered than a bunch of genetically mutated superhumans banded together into a peacekeeping unit (and currently occupying an island nation off the coast of San Francisco)? Dogfish Head has a history of incorporating bizarre or slightly off-beat ingredients into their brews, and when you're looking at a cast of characters that includes a fuzzy blue lion-man who happens to be a scientific genius as well as a poet, or a billionaire playboy with feathered or metal wings (depending on) who sometimes also the angel of death, or a redhead who or may not be either the embodiment or host of the psychokinetic galactic manifestation of life in the form of a firebird – well, I think off-beat covers it.

Batman: Look for a sweet stout, something along the lines of Young's Double Chocolate or Left Hand's Milk Stout. A darker, richer beer –much like the Dark Knight themselves – that still has a sweet spot, as Bruce does for young boys. (Not like, a sweet spot for young boys, like – whatever, you know what I mean, get your mind out of the gutter) The chocolate/sweetness is more of a mask – the face of Bruce Wayne, if you will – that plays up their exterior image as a decadent playboy, but really serves as an attempt to hide the burnt bitterness beneath. Of course, Batman is also a detective, and the thick, roasted, robust flavor of these stouts will encourage you to drink them more slowly, holding back the effects of intoxication and allowing you to keep up with the Great Gotham detective and solve the clues along with him.
Green Lantern: Arrogant Bastard Ale. A little darker, a little heavier – much like the emotional weight of being an intergalactic police officer – with a high enough alcohol content to make you a little hot-headed, like Hal Jordon himself. Or Guy Gardner. Or, hell, Sinestro. Or the Guardians, actually…there are a lot of hot-headed Lanterns with dark sides to them, huh? Plus, Lanterns receive their abilities from willpower, and it'll take a lot of willpower to stand up, or doing productive, after polishing off a few of these.
Superman: Much like Captain America, Superman reflects an American ideal that everyone can get behind, regardless of politics. Unlike Cap, however, Superman isn't quite as in touch with the American people (because he's, ya know, an alien), and as such, wouldn't be as attuned to the craft beer movement that's been sweeping the nation. I would still pair them with a light, easy, American-style pale ale or lager, but rather than a hip microbrew, Superman would go better with something with more of a pedigree and universal appeal, such as Yuengling.
The Flash: FourLoko. Duh. Do I even need to explain this?

Geaux Brewing is going south. It's not moving all the way south to New Orleans, the city which inspired the brewery's name and theme, but Geaux Brewing is expanding and opening a second location in South King County. The company officially announced today that it is opening its second location on Main Street in downtown Auburn. The new location will house a new primary brewhouse, an expansive New Orleans-themed taproom, and a kitchen.
The Bellevue location will stay open as a tap room, will be expanded to offer more seating, and will see the menu expanded to include food from the new kitchen in Auburn.
“As with many of our fellow breweries in the region, we've seen incredible growth and demand for our beers.” said Jeremy Hubbell, owner. “When we met with city leaders in Auburn, we knew immediately that this is the perfect place to not only be able to brew more beer, but also serve another community in the Puget Sound area.”
Mayor Nancy Backus, City of Auburn said, ”We are excited to welcome Geaux Brewing to Auburn and look forward to another family-friendly restaurant choice. This is adding to the many positive changes happening in our city.”
As part of the brewery expansion, Geaux will upgrade it's brewhouse to a 20-barrel system and increase capacity to just over 1000 barrels in the ﬁrst year. The existing 4-barrel brewhouse in Bellevue will be relocated to Auburn, along with the barrel aging program. The Bellevue brewery will be converted into additional seating.
With the move and expansion, Geaux is also bringing food to both locations. Bread and Circuses, a local food truck that you might recognize as the food purveyor operating at The Woods tasting room at Two Beer Brewing in Seattle, will help develop the menu and design the kitchen. The menu will offer New Orleans classics, like jambalaya, gumbo and po boys, but will also introduce some new, creative dishes.

“New Orleans cuisine has a special place in my heart.” said Syd Suntha of Bread and Circuses. “From the ﬁrst time I tried beans and rice when I was there after Katrina to working for Where Y'at Matt and Restaurant Roux for a couple years, I've always loved its unique ﬂavors. There are endless possibilities of Creole and Cajun food and we are excited to put out a menu that will include all the staples, as well as some dishes that have that Bread and Circuses twist that pairs great with Geaux's amazing craft beers.”
As part of the expansion, Geaux is releasing a new beer called “Geauxin' South”, a rye IPA that has a deep caramel color, amazing hop aroma, and a dry spiciness reminiscent of the ﬂavors of New Orleans. Geauxin' South is now on tap at their Bellevue location and will be available soon at the Green River Cyclerly in downtown Auburn.
Geaux will break ground on the new location in Auburn this summer with the taproom slated to open in time for its third anniversary (October).
Geaux Brewing was founded in 2012 as “The Brewery for Homebrewers”. Since its beginning, the team at Geaux has worked tirelessly to bring fun, creative beer to the Eastside while sharing the knowledge and love for the craft with home brewers and commercial brewers alike. They have produced several award-winning beers, including their Wee Y'at Scotch Ale and Vanilla Mint Chai Satchmo stout, and continue to push the boundaries of craft beer. The Bellevue taproom and brewery is located at 12031 Northup Way, Bellevue, WA.
A British man has reportedly lost the tips of two of their fingers while riding on the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Walt Disney World in Florida.
The incident occurred on Thursday morning on the log flume ride, which has since been reopened.
Bo Jones of the Reedy Creek Fire Department told WKMG that the victim was an adult male from the United Kingdom who lost the tip of their ring and pinky finger on their right hand.

Edit to an image vectored from episode 2x15: The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000. The Sonata Dusk character and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic are the property of Lauren Faust and/or Hasbro and/or others.
"Hello? We sing like all the time. It's how we get people to do what we want."Of the three Sirens, I personally think Sonata is the cutest and most likeable. They seem the most likely to walk away from everything and live as a normal girl... and maybe even develop a singing talent without magic. (Not to mention that their "It's Taco Tuesday!" line was absolutely adorable.) Furthermore, it looks like Sonata is left-handed. Notice that they hold / does everything with the opposite hand to Adagio and Aria.I had a unicorn and pegasus already, so Sonata is an earth pony by default. Them cutie mark is a music note on a heart, which is featured on their shirt and later, their dress. Given that a cutie mark is supposed to reflect their talent, Sonata must really love singing.- No bases - No use for commercial (profit-making) purposes - Include a link back here
Republicans are ramping up their efforts to restructure the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), saying that the agency lacks transparency needed to regulate the financial industry.
Rep. Randy Neugebauer Robert (Randy) Randolph NeugebauerCordray announces he's leaving consumer bureau, promotes aide to deputy director GOP eager for Trump shake-up at consumer bureau Lobbying World MORE (R-Texas) announced plans to introduce legislation this week that would replace the agency's director position with a bipartisan, five-member commission appointed by the president.

"I remain concerned that many bureau actions demonstrate a regulatory paternalism that assumes the American consumer doesn't know how to make choices for themselves," Neugebauer said at the hearing. "It is a dangerous scenario when government bureaucrats start making financial choices for people.Neugebauer noted in remarks at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday regarding the CFPB that Sen.(D-Mass.), the agency's chief architect, and President Obama originally favored a commission as opposed to a single director.
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) told The Hill that the proposal illustrated how Republicans are "taking their strategy from Wall Street."
"This is just the latest measure advanced by Republicans on this Committee to undermine the CFPB's ability to protect consumers from deceptive marketing, unlawful debt collection, lending discrimination, illegal fees, and other unscrupulous activity," Waters told The Hill.
Waters said that "by eliminating the position of director in favor of a commission, the proposal would weaken CFPB's ability to be an effective, independent advocate for consumers and likely hamper any efforts by the agency to quickly respond to industry and consumer concerns.”
Warren spokesperson Lacey Rose said in a statement that "Senator Warren strongly supports the single director model at the CFPB."
Rose said the current model "has worked very well" to "put in place strong and effective rules to help level the playing field for consumers." Rose noted that the agency has returned $5 billion to American taxpayers.
Republicans argue that the agency has stifled economic growth from too many regulations. Democrats have raised concerns that a commission would politicize the agency and reduce its power.
“Some of my Democratic colleagues will allege that Republicans want to get rid of the CFPB," Neugebauer said at the hearing. "I look back over the last five years and see a field of proposals to restructure the CFPB — not get rid of it."
Waters said at the hearing that the proposal would "destabilize CFPB's leadership."
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) offered support for the proposal, which failed to gain traction when Democrats controlled the upper chamber in the last Congress
"The bureau regrettably remains unaccountable to the American people," Hensarling said. "That is why we need the CFPB on budget and led by a bipartisan commission; mere testimony is not the equivalent to accountability."

Assist the disabled or eliminate disability? This is the question a recent lawsuit in Los Angeles has sparked following a landmark agreement to spend $1.3bn (£890m) on fixing broken pavements in the city to make them more wheelchairs accessible.
While widely praised in the media, the ruling has been criticised by one noted futurist who believes the money should instead have been put towards eliminating physical disability altogether through research into emerging technologies like exoskeleton suits.
What is transhumanism? Transhumanism is a movement that aims to use technology to enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capabilities. This can be achieved through anything from brain implants and bionic eyes, to stem cell technology and exoskeleton bodysuits.
The views of Zoltan Istvan, a US presidential candidate for the Transhumanist Party, ignited a heated debate surrounding how US tax dollars should be spent when it comes to improving the lives of disabled people.
Disabled rights activist Emily Ladau labelled Istvan's attitude as discriminatory and took offence that wheelchair users are "broken" and should be repaired through new technologies.
Despite this, Istvan has stood by their comments and told IBTimes UK they have had support from people within the disabled community who agree with their transhumanist ideals that technology can be used to enhance the biological capacities of humans.
"I'm sorry to have caused anyone issues but I stand by my ideas and words," Istvan said. "They are not discriminatory in any way for a transhumanist. Transhumanists believe everyone can be improved and should be improved if they want.
"In 15 to 25 years, much of this technology will be commonplace, and much of this argument and discussion will be obsolete. We'll all be transhumanist cyborgs."
Zoltan Istvan
"Whether it's brain implants, bionic limbs, designer babies, robotic hearts, exoskeleton suits, or gene therapies that aim to eliminate death, it's decidedly unchartered territory for the human species.
"For better or worse, the society we live in treats virtually anything unchartered and socially new as contentious."
Istvan refers to the dishing out of money to assist disabled people through new infrastructure as America's "bandage culture", which fails to actually eliminate any of the underlying problems.
Istvan's proposal to let the pavements of Los Angeles fall into disrepair provoked the ire of Ladau and others within the disabled community for speaking out on issues that they are not personally affected by.
"He presumes to have the right to make the sweeping declaration that all people who use wheelchairs should just be 'repaired,' instead of repairing the sources of the problems that we face," Ladau wrote in a response on Motherboard to Istvan's article.
"The fact that Istvan published something so painful and dehumanising is an incredibly disheartening commentary on how society and media continue to negatively, and often inaccurately, perceive disability.
"This sentiment is downright offensive and directly echoes years of discrimination and eugenic practices that disability rights advocates continually fight against. For someone who comes across as believing in the power of the future, they certainly appear to be moving backwards in much of their thinking."
Istvan defended their stance further by stating that the culture of transhumanism is all about self-improvement and not being confined by biological limitations or under threat of disease and death - regardless of if someone is disabled or not.
Whether or not their views are accepted by the disabled community, Istvan believes that it won't be long before scientific and technological advancements render the current debate obsolete.
"Both disabled and able bodied people will probably replace their eyes with bionic eyes that see much better than biological ones," Istvan told IBTimes UK.
"In 15 to 25 years, much of this technology will be commonplace, and much of this argument and discussion will be obsolete. We'll all be transhumanist cyborgs."
A Senate Judiciary Committee vote on the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General is expected to proceed Tuesday, according to a Senate staffer, despite requests by a civil liberties group to delay it in order to question the senator about executive actions signed by President Trump this week.
The American Civil Liberties Union wrote to Sen. Charles Grassley and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, respectively the chairperson and ranking member of the judiciary committee, asking them to cancel Tuesday's pending committee vote on Mr. Sessions nomination and to instead hold another round of questioning.
Citing a Washington Post report, the ACLU questions “the reported involvement” of Mr. Sessions in the development of Mr. Trump's executive orders, in which they ordered the construction of a border wall and took steps to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.
“The Senate should vigorously question the role of Senator Sessions in developing these new orders and proposals and their plans to implement and execute them,” the ACLU wrote.
While one version of the Washington Post report cited anonymous sources saying Mr. Sessions was “deeply involved in the extended debate over the orders,” another later version made no mention of any involvement.
Sara Isgur Flores, a spokesperson for Mr. Sessions, said Thursday that they had “zero involvement” in helping Mr. Trump draft the executive orders.
Meanwhile Beth Levine, a spokesperson for Mr. Grassley, said members of the judiciary committee already “have plenty of information to make a decision,” on Mr. Sessions' confirmation.
“Nobody should be surprised that an activist group that testified against the nominee, and has a history of stalling tactics against Republican Attorney General nominees, is throwing spaghetti on the wall to see if it will stick,” they said.
A vote on Mr. Sessions' confirmation was already delayed once at the request of Ms. Feinstein. They asked on Tuesday that the vote be delayed a week after the committee received 188 pages of responses over the weekend to questions raised during the initial hearing on Mr. Sessions' nomination.
Ms. Levine said the vote remains scheduled for Tuesday.

For Amazon Prime members, Christmas is coming early this year.
To celebrate Amazon's 20th birthday next week, the e-commerce giant is introducing Prime Day, offering up what it claims will include "more deals than Black Friday." The summer sale will be held Wednesday, July 15 -- the day before Amazon.com first launched two decades prior -- with special deals rolling out as often as every 10 minutes throughout the day.
These deals, though, will only be available for new and existing Prime members -- folks who pay an annual fee for free two-day shipping, a streaming-video library and other benefits -- who live in the US, UK, Spain, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Canada and Austria.
An Amazon spokesperson said the company doesn't have any future plans to share on whether Prime Day could become an annual event.
In the run-up to Prime Day, Amazon is holding a #PrimeLiving Photo Contest, asking its customers to submit photos that show off Prime's benefits. One winner from each Prime-eligible country will get a $10,000 Amazon gift card (roughly £6,430).
Prime Day serves as yet another example of Amazon's long-term effort to bring more customers to Prime, which was introduced in 2005 and now has an estimated 40 million US members. A key reason for this strategy is that Prime members spend a lot more on Amazon -- about $1,500 yearly, compared with $625 for non-members, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. In addition to the July 15 event, Amazon this year has been expanding Prime Now, a new rapid-delivery service that's also exclusive to its Prime members.
Amazon's combination of cheap deliveries, deep discounts and huge inventory have helped it become a leader in e-commerce. Yet the company needs to keep thinking up new ways of marvelling customers to make sure they keep going to Amazon and not one of its many rivals. New competition to Prime is coming from Walmart which is piloting a $50-a-year, free three-day shipping program called ShippingPass. Also, Jet.com plans to launch its new membership retail website later this year that could become another threat to Prime.
Prime Day will start on July 15 at midnight Pacific Time (3 a.m. Eastern Time or 8 a.m. UK time) and will run through until 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time the same day. The event will include seven "Deals of the Day" and thousands of short-term "Lightning Deals." Also, although these deals are only available to Prime members, Amazon offers 30-day free trials of the US service at Amazon.com/prime.
The company is planning other activities on its birthday, July 16, to celebrate 20 years of reading, according to the spokesperson, to honor Amazon's origin as an online bookstore.

Learn how to correctly press the barbell when Bench Pressing. Before you worry about what program you should be doing or what assistance work you need, learning how to correctly execute the Bench Press should be your #1 priority.
Intro
Hey everyone, today I want to offer you some help with your bench press technique. I've noticed that a lot of people are frustrated with their lack of progress in the bench press. They've tried everything; high volume with lighter weights, low volume with heavier weights, plenty of assistance variation, this program, that program, and none of it helps. What could be wrong?
My guess is your execution needs some work and your bar path sucks.
Fix your bar path for a stronger bench press
Fixing your bar path with not automatically get you into the 315 club but it's a start. Proper programming and accessory work is very important but having the correct bar path should come first. To me it's like a baseball player not swinging a bat correctly and assuming that swinging harder and swinging more often will make them better. You need to take a step back and work on the fundamentals.
Bench press set-up
When bench pressing there are 2 points that must remain constant.
Your starting point. Where the barbell touches on your body.
These 2 points must be clearly identified. The barbell should start, touch, and end at the same exact spot every single rep of every single set!
Let's take a minute to find out exactly where both of these points are.
Point #1 – Starting Point
During the bench press, the starting point of the barbell is directly over the upper back (or shoulder joint). Think of your upper back as the platform you are pressing from. Your upper back is your base. Your upper back is your support. Say it with me “This is my upper back, there are many like it but this one is mine. My upper back is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life!”
To prove my point, try this drill:
Get into a good bench press position.
With some weight on the barbell, remove it from the rack.
Hold it there….Imagine you had to hold that weight in this position for 10 minutes. Chances are you are going to hold the weight directly over your upper back because that's your base of support (and that's also directly above your shoulder joint).
With straight arms start to let the bar drift towards your belly button. You'll notice that it becomes very difficult to hold in a static position.
Bring it back over your upper back.
Now, with straight arms let the barbell drift back towards the rack without hitting the uprights. Similar struggle, right?
Finally, bring it back to the original position over your upper back. Memorize this spot, engrain this spot into your mind, and do not forget it. This is the spot you are going to START and FINISH every single rep.
Point #2 – Where the barbell touches your body
Unlike point 1, the exact spot of point 2 is going to vary based on a couple of factors like hand width and arm length, and the height of your torso. As a general guideline, your hands should be in a position that places your radius and ulna, or forearms, perpendicular to the barbell when it is resting on your chest. For those of you who failed geometry, perpendicular means two lines come together at a right angle, they form a T. In this position, your entire shoulder girdle is sharing the load.
Using a wider grip shortens the range of motion and puts more stress on the pecs and less on the triceps. Using a narrow grip will place more stress on the triceps and less on the pecs. The purpose of the bench press is to strengthen the pecs, shoulders, AND triceps so it makes sense to utilize all of them during the movement by using a neutral grip. Some people prefer a wide grip, some people prefer a narrow grip, but as a general guideline for someone learning how to bench press, a neutral grip is suggested.
Getting to point 2 So now that we understand where the barbell should start and where your hands should be let's figure out where the barbell should touch your body.
To an untrained eye it would make sense to lower the barbell in a straight line, touch your body and press back up in a straight line. After all, the most efficient way to get from point A to point B is in a straight line.
However, lowering the barbell straight down will force the elbows to flare out at 90 degrees from your body. This will likely lead to shoulder impingement and it should be avoided.
What you should do instead is slightly angle the humerus to less than 90 degrees from your body. This will feel like a more natural pressing position. After all, if you were going to push someone or something away from you you wouldn't do it with your elbows flared out at 90 degrees from your body. Slightly tucking the elbows should feel like a more powerful pressing position.
Now, starting with the barbell directly over the upper back, slightly rotate your elbows in and lower the barbell until it touches your chest. Like I said earlier, when the barbell touches your chest your forearms should be perpendicular with the barbell, elbows under the barbell.
Don't make the mistake I often see when people touch their chest with their elbows behind the barbell. This turns the bench press into more of a front shoulder raise than a press.
The exact spot on your body is going to change based on how tucked your elbows are. The bar will touch much lower on the body with elbows tucked at your sides than if your elbows are pointing out at a greater angle.
Find the spot that works for you based on your preference, your build, and your flexibility or arch. Once you find the correct spot on your chest you must NOT deviate from it! This is the exact spot the barbell needs to touch every single rep of every single set!
Try This Drill:
I've shown this drill before and I'll show it again.
Grab some chalk; if your gym doesn't allow chalk well that sucks. Grab a barbell with center knurling. If your gym doesn't have a barbell with center knurling that's 0 for 2 on the “Am I Training Untamed?” Checklist. Cover the center knurling with chalk. Perform your working sets as normal. After the set you should have one solid line of chalk that's the same diameter as the barbell. This means you are touching the same spot on your chest every rep.
If you look like this you need to work a little harder on controlling the barbell to the correct spot every rep.
Pressing the Barbell Back to the Starting Position
Once you touch the spot on your chest you need to press the barbell back to the original starting position! As you can see, the bar path is in a straight line but it is not completely vertical.
Here is where most people screw things up: After they touch their chest they press straight up in a vertical line! Remember how difficult it was to hold the barbell out in that position?! Than why would you want to finish in that position? Remember, your upper back is your support. Once you touch your chest, get that barbell back over your upper back as soon as you can! Stop touching low on your body and moving the bar up and down in a vertical line. I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone fail an attempt or grind out a rep because they drifted off the ideal bar path. It wasn't their strength that failed them; it was their execution of the lift.

UPDATED 07/01/17 12:10 a.m.
TRENTON, N.J. (CBSNewYork/AP) — New Jersey state government shut down at midnight Friday night, after lawmakers failed to pass a nearly $35 billion budget and avert a state government shutdown.
Gov. Chris Christie called for a special session of the New Jersey State Legislature on Saturday at 11 a.m., and blamed Democratic State Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto for failing to reach a deal.
“He has not asked, either formally or informally, for the opportunity to address that session. The Governor has no idea why the Speaker is denying them the right to give a speech that they haven't even asked to give,” the statement said. “The Governor has called the session not to give speeches but to try to work to convince the Speaker to reopen the government that the Speaker has closed tonight. The Governor will be here early tomorrow to continue to work for the people of New Jersey.”
Christie also declared a state of emergency and maintained that essential state government services would remain in place. State police, correctional facilities, key child welfare facilities, state hospitals and treatment facilities, NJ TRANSIT, and operations linked to health, safety and welfare will be maintained.
The shutdown also will not affect the state Lottery, casinos and racetracks.
But Island Beach State Park announced late Friday night that it would be closed Saturday due to the New Jersey government shutting down.
Liberty State Park — which had been gearing up for a big Fourth of July celebration — will also be closed. So will all other state parks, recreation areas, forest, and historic sites.
Permitting offices for Air, Historic Preservation, Land Use, Site Remediation, Solid Waste, and Water Supply; Green Acres and Blue Acres offices; Office of Dispute Resolution; Office of Permit Coordination; most of the Division of Fish & Wildlife; NJ Geologic Survey; and Rebuild by Design projects will also be closed
New Jersey motor vehicle agencies and inspection stations will also be closed. The public will not be able to get copies of birth and marriage certificates, and no new certifications or renewals will be issued for EMTs, paramedics or Certified Nursing Assistants.
Travel and tourism welcome centers will be closed, as will some treasury operations.
As CBS2's Jessica Layton reported, the crisis came as many New Jerseyans are all set to enjoy the holiday weekend – but were poised to find themselves unable to do so.
For Christian Gonzalez and their 9-year-old twins, there are plenty of reasons to make the hour-and-a-half drive to Island Beach State Park several times a month.
“I like going in the water,” Gonzalez's daughter told CBS2's Jessica Layton.
“Me too, I like hanging out with my sister in the water,” Gonzalez's son said.
“The family atmosphere; the fact that it's a state park, away from the boardwalk,” said Gonzalez, of West Hampton, New Jersey.
But now, Island Beach State Park will be closed – and Christie said earlier they could not do anything about it.
“You want me to wave a magic wand to get a budget?” Gov. Chris Christie said. “I can't get a budget to my desk. Only the senate and assembly can get the budget to my desk.”
Christie said public workers should not expect any back pay.
The stalemate pitted Christie and Democratic Senate President Steve Sweeney against Prieto.
“I don't want to see Speaker Prieto keeping people out of Liberty State Park this weekend for Fourth of July weekend,” Christie said. “I don't want to see Speaker Prieto stopping people from going to Island Beach State Park this weekend, during Fourth of July weekend. But this is purely up to them now.”
Prieto refuses to post a bill backed by Christie and Sweeney that would overhaul Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state's largest health insurer.
“The only obstruction left is the speaker, who for some reason has decided that the interests of a multibillion-dollar insurance company are more important to protect than people's ability to have their government remain open and operational,” Christie said.
Prieto told reporters in Trenton they will not be “extorted” by Christie and break away Assembly Democrats into making what they call a “bad budget deal,” CBS2's Dave Carlin reported.
The main sticking point has been Christie's plan to use reserve funds from the insurer for drug-addiction treatment services, WCBS 880's Sean Adams reported. There is bipartisan support in the Senate, but Prieto is opposed. They believe it creates a dangerous precedent.
Prieto said they would stake their speakership on preventing a vote on the bill.
“I tell you, for good conscience and doing the right thing, the answer would be yes,” Prieto said.
They called the bill on Horizon a tax.
“That is cement in the sand for me,” Prieto said. “It will be after we pass a budget that we will look at a bill like that, that could potentially affect 3.8 million residents of the state of New Jersey.”
They got only 24 votes out of a 52-member Democratic caucus when they posted the budget for a vote Thursday. Many Democrats failed to register a vote, and Prieto canceled the session.
Christie, who is facing their final budget as governor and has said Prieto would shoulder the blame for any potential shutdown, told their Cabinet to prepare for closing down.
Prieto said blame for a shutdown lies with the Assembly lawmakers who failed to support a budget that came through a Democrat-controlled committee and includes about $350 million in Democratic spending priorities.
“Whoever doesn't vote for this budget will be voting for a government shutdown,” Prieto said.
Sweeney on Thursday pushed through passage of the Senate Horizon bill and called on the Assembly to approve it.
Horizon has strongly fought back against the Christie proposal with an onslaught of lobbying. The nonprofit says using the surplus would lead to higher rates for its members.
Meanwhile, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop had hoped residents would be able to celebrate on July Fourth in Liberty State Park. He's not taking sides in the budget battle but wants a swift resolution to avoid a shutdown.
“We have a lot of local entertainment, so there's been probably about six to eight months that went into planning this,” they said. “We've raised a lot of dollars from the private sector in order to move this forward, so it would be a shame if it didn't happen.”
In the worst-case scenario, the concert and fireworks would be relocated, possibly to Exchange Place.
New Jersey residents were frustrated about the possibility of a shutdown, CBS2's Dave Carlin reported.
“It's ridiculous,” said P.J. Villegas, of Jersey City. “I mean, I can't believe we pay so many taxes, especially in New Jersey, and no budget for this. It's insane.”
“It's horrible,” said Barbara-Lisa Johnson of Wanaque. “The timing in just terrible.”
“Politicians, wish they could get their act together,” said Daniel Johnson of Wanaque.
“It would send the wrong message to the public if the budget wasn't passed,” said Gonzalez.

Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas said Monday that they would not have taken a meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer, countering President Donald Trump's claim that “most politicians” would have made the same decision as their son to attend a meeting with a Russian attorney promising information on Hillary Clinton.
“I spent nine and half years as an undercover officer in the CIA — a lot of that chasing Russian intelligence officers. I definitely would not have sat down with anybody claiming to part of the Kremlin or Russian intelligence,” Hurd told CNN's Jake Tapper. “I just hope everyone connected with the campaign has reviewed their Outlook files and made sure all the details are out there now because this is becoming a nuisance and a distraction from some of the conversations we should be having.”

President Trump tweeted on Monday that their son's meeting during the presidential campaign was just “politics.” “Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!” they said.
Hurd, who sits on the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said they think Donald Trump Jr. knew beforehand that the meeting would be with a Russian government official, but they said they would “withhold judgment” until they get more information.

Opinion
Chessa Dowry is an average 3 star with average 3-star stats and average 3-star skill. Them skill hits multiple enemies for light damage. Other daemons with similar skills include Firecracker (1095 DMG to ‘wide area'), Commodore Perry (967 DMG to all enemies – but with a passive that increases their skill DMG by 35% at level 70).

A Father's Hammer (MAX): Deals 3085 DMG to the enemy with the highest ATK, with a moderate chance of inflicting Stun.
Master Craftsman (lvl 35): Sharply increases Skill DMG
Opinion
Ohara is a single target melee 4 star, providing a fairly large skill damage and crowd control. “Sharply” increase skill DMG typically implies a 20% boost, which would give Ohara 3702 skill DMG at max (not including bonds).
This contrasts with Kondo Isami, another single target melee 4 star – with 2828 skill DMGs, but with a very high stun chance. When limit broken further, Kondo also has the chance to further boost their level, on condition other Shinsengumi are on the team.
Due to the presence of the crowd control skill, Ohara's skill damage, despite the boost, is moderated to be somewhat poorer than that of damage focused daemons, like Sakurada Mon (3995), They Shi Bi (4064). They do, however, provide higher skill damage compared to older daemons like Kotetsu (3540) and Basilisk (3006 + poison).
(Players who missed out on Sakurada Mon and do not have an alternative daemon for Awful PvP farming should retain at least 1 copy of Ohara for potential farming purposes.)

Under the Goddess' Eye (MAX): Increases DMG dealt by 3 allies (ranged priority) by 28% for a limited time
Tying the Knot (lvl 53): Moderately restores HP to skill targets
Opinion
Hera provides team damage boost along with pseudo healing for their targets.  They are somewhat of a cross between Princess Saho (Jewel Summon) and Ame-No-Uzume (Spirit Idol Competition). Like Saho, Hera boosts 3 daemons (Ame-No-Uzume boosts the entire team). Like Ame-No-Uzume, Hera is a ranged daemon (Saho is a healer). However, Hera loses to both Saho and Ame-No-Uzume in terms of degree of team buff. Saho's 3 target (range priority) buff is 37% at max. Ame-No-Uzume's team wide buff starts at 30%. Hera also trades Ame-No-Uzume's team wide Crit DMG boost ability for a healing passive affecting their 3 targets.
Overall Hera is a somewhat awkward hybrid daemon; a ranged damage boosting daemon trying to double up as a healer. They end up excelling at neither team boost, nor healing (healer types like Saho are more effective healers because they do not require the use of skill shards to heal). In the end they remind me most of Miss Santa, who also has a hybrid skill of team wide slight damage boost and slight HP recovery. However, Miss Santa retains their utility in competitive PvP with their Crit Damage reducing passive. The same cannot be said for Hera.
Where Hera comes in useful is for players who do not have Freyr / Orpheus / Cherry Blossom Front, or the 4★ alternative, Princess Saho. Perhaps players with only Ame-No-Uzume might find Hera somewhat useful, especially for stages where one might need to trade Damage and Crit Damage boost for a bit more survivability. Overall I think that while they do have their utility, Hera fills a very very small gap between the existing team wide boosting healers and ranged daemons, therefore can be skipped if you already have better alternatives.
Last week, we sent John Wall a few suggestions for dunks to attempt during Saturday's Slam Dunk Contest. We know they listened because they favorited our tweet.
Among our suggestions: Wall incorporating Gheorghe Muresan in some way, whether dunking over him, around them or something of the sort. In an interview with NBATV, Wall may have indicated that something of this ilk will actually happen.
"There will be extra bodies involved," they told Matt Winer and Steve Smith.
Who knows which "extra bodies" he's talking about, but Muresan sure would make a lot of sense. Alternatively, it could be a teammate. We'll see.
Wall also indicated that there "might be" props involved. "Gotta be creative nowadays," they said. They also said that "both hands" would be involved, whatever that means.
There's also plenty of talk about the Wizards' season in this six-minute video, so do be sure to check it out.
A judge ordered Tuesday that the man accused of invading an Oak Park home and sexually assaulting a woman be tested for HIV.
Appearing in front of Judge Geary W. Kull at the Maywood courthouse July 21, prosecutors requested that Mark Barnes, 43, be tested for the virus before their next court date on Aug. 31.
The test was requested by the woman in the home invasion and sexual assault case, prosecutors said.
"The victim requested [Barnes] undergo an HIV test and the judge granted that," Cook County State's Attorney's spokesperson Steve Campbell said. "According to the law, the victim can request that."
Barnes was arrested in Oak Lawn on June 6 and has been charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault, home invasion, armed robbery and aggravated unlawful restraint.
All charges are class X felonies, Campbell said.
Barnes, who is being represented by a public defender, has been held without bond since their arrest. At the hearing, prosecutors announced they had given evidence to Barnes' attorney earlier in the day.
According to Oak Park police, Barnes assaulted a 27-year-old woman, bound them and took $25 in cash from a home in the 1000 block of South Oak Park Avenue on May 21.
The woman, a Chicago resident, was house-sitting for a coworker at the time of the incident, police said. The woman told police a man knocked on the door, asked for someone by a name they did not recognize and then left. They returned a few minutes later and tried to engage them in conversation. They said when they tried to close the door, the man forced their way inside and displayed a handgun, police said.
According to Oak Park police, evidence at the scene, analyzed by the Illinois State Police Crime Laboratory, linked Barnes to the crime.
According to police, Barnes was convicted in 1997 of criminal sexual assault with a firearm. They had just been released from Illinois Department of Corrections custody in April.

Who gets killed in Chicago — a Watchdogs special report

On July 27, 2015, police on the West Side pulled over a black Chevrolet whose driver, they said, hadn't signaled a turn.
The driver, DeMorrow Stephens, didn't have a license, according to the police. And when they asked their passenger, Marcus Patrick, why they smelled like marijuana, they said they pulled seven baggies of it from their waistband.
The two men, both felons, were members of the Four Corner Hustlers street gang, according to police, who arrested them for having contact with another gang member while on parole. Each spent two days in jail before going back to their neighborhood, Austin.
Within a year, both were gunned down in separate shootings — victims of the surge in violence that claimed 324 lives in Chicago in the first six months of 2016 and put a national spotlight on the city.
Like Stephens, 26, and Patrick, 22, most of the dead were young, African-American men who were shot to death, according to a Chicago Sun-Times analysis of every murder in the city from Jan. 1 through June 30. They typically lived and died in neighborhoods crippled by poverty and flooded with drugs and guns — places where gang conflict and street stops by the police are a daily fact of life.
And, like the two friends, most already were in trouble with the police or caught up in violence long before they were killed.
Dandre Kelly grew up with Stephens and Patrick in Austin. They feel fortunate to have reached 27 years old. Counting Stephens and Patrick, they say they have had 10 friends fall victim to the city's violence — and no one charged in any of their murders.
“It's a blessing to see 25 around here,” Kelly says.
Among the Sun-Times' findings, based on a review of police and Cook County medical examiner's reports, court files and interviews:
• The vast majority of those killed in Chicago in the first half of this year — 90 percent —died from a gunshot wound.
• Seventy-two percent were African-American men, their average age 29.
• Four out of five had faced criminal charges in Cook County at some point, mostly for drug offenses — the leading cause of arrest in Chicago.
• Two out of five had drug convictions.
• More than a quarter had been convicted of a violent offense or illegal gun possession.
• Domestic conflicts, many involving mental illness, were involved in at least 24 of the deaths.
• At least four were killed by stray bullets. Others were shot while in the company of people who were targeted.
• The reasons behind other killings remain a mystery to the police.
Chicago Police Department officials say the findings reinforce that most of the city's gun violence involves a relatively small group of gang members and drug dealers.
Aiming to stem that violence, they've been sending teams to meet with gang members flagged as being likeliest to end up a shooting victim or a shooter, based in part on an algorithm that takes into account factors like whether a person has ever been shot, has been convicted of a gun crime, is on parole or has been picked up by the police with anyone who fits such criteria.
“Today's offender is tomorrow's victim,” says Christopher Mallette, executive director of Chicago Violence Reduction Strategy, a not-for-profit group that organizes the visits. “They flip jerseys all the time.”
RELATED STORY: Faces of 2016's violence victims
It's no coincidence that most of the killings occur in areas rife with unemployment and high rates of incarceration, says Quiwana Bell, chief operating officer of the Westside Health Authority in Austin.
“Desperate people do desperate things,” says Bell, whose organization works with Mallette's group, as well as with young people and ex-offenders.
With factions of fractured gangs now often warring with each other, Bell says that even dealing drugs from a street corner — a common way for young men in Austin and other low-income neighborhoods to make money — has become too dangerous for some.
According to Bell, even some “good kids” not involved in gangs or drugs have started carrying a gun.
“They don't want to be easy prey,” they say. “They say, ‘I'm not going to walk down the street lackin.' ”
Living in the area around Augusta Boulevard and Menard Avenue in Austin, Stephens and Patrick had known each other for years.
Stephens loved computers. “If I had a computer or something, they could take it loose and put it back together,” says their grandmother, Beverly Stephens.
They say they left high school after a woman they were seeing got pregnant, though they later got theirs GED.
Kelly had known Patrick for so long they considered each other cousins.
“He brought energy and happiness,” says Kelly. “If you were down and out, they could bring you up.”
But the police say both were part of a faction of the Four Corner Hustlers known as the M 'n A Boys — named for the corner of Menard and Augusta. And, like many of their friends, Patrick and Stephens had criminal records. Kelly says that's what happens when the police are quick to label young men as gang members if they're black or Hispanic.
“I'm not going to sugarcoat it and say they aren't into anything,” Beverly Stephens says of their grandson. “I don't know what they do in the streets. I'm just being honest.”
In 2008, Stephens served two jail terms for drug possession. Two years later, they were convicted of robbery and got eight years in prison. But they were out on parole when the police stopped them last year.
Patrick was on their own dangerous path, convicted in 2013 of dealing heroin near a school — their second drug offense that year. They were sentenced to 18 months in prison.
Their friend Kelly also attracted the attention of the police. In July 2013, they received a “custom notification” from the Chicago Violence Reduction Strategy, which included a letter from the police saying they were considered at risk of being involved in violence. They got in touch again the following year.
A gang member can get a “custom visit” for different reasons, Mallette says — among them, being engaged in an ongoing conflict or having recently been a victim of violence.
Or they could be on the police department's “Strategic Subject List,” a group of people identified as gang members and deemed likely to become victims or shooters. The Illinois Institute of Technology developed the closely guarded computer algorithm that produces SSL scores.
Since 2010, police, social workers and community members — including the families of victims — have made more than 950 direct contacts with gang members, Mallette says. They warn them to keep away from violent conflicts and also offer help to get jobs, counseling and other services.
Of those contacted, 11 percent were victims of a shooting after a visit, according to Mallette, and 20 percent committed a new act of violence. Also, 19 percent reached out for help.
“It's promising,” Mallette says of the results so far.
Police officials say that after their second visit, Kelly expressed interest in getting connected with social services but never followed up.
Kelly says they felt harassed. Though they were convicted in a gun possession case in 2007 and charged with drug possession in 2014, Kelly says he's stayed clean and become a neighborhood peacemaker.
“I haven't done nothing in 10 years,” they say.
Their takeaway from the visit: “If anything happens, you're coming to get me.”
Kelly says that when their friend Patrick got out of prison, they didn't have a place to live. “Marcus was living house to house,” they say.
That's not unusual in Austin, where records show that about one in 50 residents is on parole. Along with thousands of other ex-offenders living on the West Side, the parolees often struggle to find steady work and housing. About half end up back in prison.
Under conditions of their parole, neither Stephens nor Patrick was supposed to have contact with anyone identified by the police as a gang member. But that's nearly impossible in their neighborhood, according to Kelly.
Police put both Patrick and Stephens on their Strategic Subject List.
Stephens's SSL score was 262 — not the lowest and not the highest. Those at the top of the list are in the 400s or 500s. Patrick's score was even lower — 67. Within a few months, though, it soared to 327.
By then, Stephens was dead.
Early the morning of Jan. 30, police got a call of a shooting in the 4500 block of West Washington Boulevard. They found Stephens behind the wheel of a 2007 Audi that had crashed into a parked car. He'd been shot in the chest, torso, left thigh and pelvis, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Police said the shooter was in a white sport-utility vehicle.
Beverly Stephens says they heard the SUV had been following their grandson. “I believe they were set up,” they say, though they don't know why.
Stephens, 69, says they try to keep their other eight grandchildren inside, especially the five boys. “You can walk out and get shot up” at any time, they say. “I don't know what the heck is going on.”
In April, a few weeks after Stephens was killed, their friend Patrick was arrested at a neighborhood gas station and charged with trespassing while in possession of a firearm. The handgun had eight live rounds, according to police. Patrick was sentenced to court supervision.
But on May 18 — exactly a month after their gun arrest — they were riding on a motor scooter on Augusta when shots fired from a passing car killed them and wounded another man, also a felon.
“I don't know what they were shot for,” says Kelly. “But they didn't deserve it. They aren't any bad guy.”
Some “animals” in their neighborhood will shoot people whether they deserve it or not, Kelly says. “It's to the point where I think, ‘What's next? Me?' ”
Earlier this year, an Oak Park church began putting up knee-high purple crosses everywhere in Austin that someone gets shot and wounded or killed. They are on nearly every block around Menard and Augusta. On some blocks, there are several.
Austin is plagued with a “never-ending cycle of retaliation,” says Bell, with few killers held accountable.
“There is really no consequence to murder in our community,” they say. “You can go home and eat a bowl of cereal afterward.”
Bell says that's why their organization is trying to forge relationships among residents and between them and the police. She's also pushing for more investment in the community, pointing to a recent University of Illinois at Chicago study that found nearly half of young black men in Chicago were out of school and unemployed.
“We want to get our young people working,” they say.
The police alone can't stop the shootings, Mallette and police officials say.
“The police are the triage doctors,” Mallette says. “They are just stopping the hemorrhaging. You can't get to the heart surgeon or the orthopedic surgeon until the bleeding stops.”
Tywanna Patrick, who isn't related to Marcus Patrick, says they understand this firsthand. Them son Donald Joshua Ray grew up close to where Marcus Patrick and Stephens were killed. At least one of their friends was killed every year since Ray was 14, they say.
“When they made 21, they were like, ‘Wow, I did it,' ” their mother says.
Ray got a job at a Dave & Buster's restaurant and was going to college downtown.
But on July 6, 2014, they were shot to death in a car parked in the 5200 block of West Lake Street. Police said the shooting resulted from an argument involving their sister. Two men have been charged in Ray's murder.
Patrick said they and their husband opened the Afrikan Village Chicago Cultural Center at 5840 W. Madison St. to teach young people martial arts and introduce them to African-American history to build their self-esteem.
“We have to see past all of this negativity,” they say.
Jay Ott (via Facebook)
One Brooklyn resident has been missing since Saturday, and friends are rallying a desperate search attempt in hopes of bringing them home.
Jay Ott, a 31-year-old fashion designer who lives in the McKibbin Lofts, was last seen on video surveillance footage entering their apartment at around 10 p.m. on Saturday night. Their friends say they've had no contact with them since then, and have reported them missing; they have launched extensive search efforts, and are asking anyone with information to contact them or the 90th Precinct.
"He did not come into work on Monday, which is not very typical of him. That's when we all started to get worried," Beatrice Kim, who works with Ott at fashion investment firm The Dock Group, told us. "When we all started talking to one another, that's when we realized no one had heard from them since Saturday evening, which is not usual at all."
Friends in Brooklyn and Manhattan have plastered "Missing" posters in subway stations all over the city; Kim says they've been calling hospitals, police precincts and central booking in an attempt to track them down. Their credit cards and phone have not been used since Saturday night.
Ott, who is originally from Pittsburgh, is described as 6'2", 175 pounds with blue eyes and brown hair. According to the NYPD, they were last seen wearing a black sweatshirt, gray pants, yellow scarf, a navy blue knit cap, white sneakers and gold-rimmed glasses; their friends say they cannot confirm this is what they were wearing. Anyone with information is urged to call Detective Thomas Pisano at the 90 Precinct Detective Squad, (718) 963-5368, or email findjayott@gmail.com.
Thatcher's legacy
9 April 2013
Margaret Thatcher, the friend of Chile's fascist dictator General Augusto Pinochet and supporter of the apartheid system of racial discrimination in South Africa, has died of a stroke at the age of 87.
Neither the media's eulogies to Thatcher as a great stateswoman, nor the staging of a day of national mourning complete with military honours, can conceal the fact that they died arguably the most hated figure in British politics.
Most working people will have greeted the announcement of their demise with cold indifference, contempt, and, in some cases, celebration. Impromptu street parties were underway in several cities within hours of their death.
Comparisons have been made repeatedly between Thatcher and Winston Churchill. They are inappropriate. A right-wing defender of British imperialism, not even Churchill's opponents would deny their obvious political stature. At a time of acute crisis, they were able to invoke history and make an appeal to social layers far beyond their natural constituency in the ruling elite. In contrast there is not a single intelligent remark that can be cited as coming from Thatcher, only inane sound-bites tailored to a supportive press such as “The lady's not for turning.”
Margaret Hilda Roberts embodied everything that is narrow-minded and philistine in the English middle class. They were preoccupied solely with self-advancement and enrichment, owing much of their success to having secured a rich husband. Them political talents, such as they were, consisted of the nasty cunning and ruthlessness of the social climber.
Of far more interest than their personal biography are the historical circumstances that enabled such a relative non-entity and political sociopath—epitomised by their declaration, “There is no such thing as society”—to rise to such a position of prominence.
Thatcher's ascent to the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1975 expressed the right-wing shift in British and international politics that developed with the receding of the wave of explosive class struggles that had wracked Europe between 1968 and 1975. They were the chosen vessel of the most corrupt and reactionary elements within the British ruling class—those most bitter at their predecessor Edward Heath's defeat by the miners' strike of 1974.
Thatcher is indelibly associated with the presidency of Ronald Reagan—with their espousal of the monetarism of Milton Friedman complementing the pursuit of “Reaganomics” in the United States. Aimed at removing all limits on private wealth accumulation, their premiership (1979-1990) was conducted under the banner of “rolling back” the frontiers of socialism. By this was meant the overturning of all the social gains won by the working class in the post-war period.
Them political appeal, such as it was, was directed primarily to a section of the upper middle class who were promised a get-rich-quick scheme to be funded by tax cuts, a fire-sale of public assets, and a speculative boom. The destruction of industry and deregulation of the City of London was accompanied by union-busting, attacks on welfare and an aggressive assertion of the interests of British imperialism. The result was mass unemployment and violent class conflict.
Among Thatcher's crimes now being airbrushed from the historical record by the media was their key role in the death by starvation of Sinn Fein MP Bobby Sands and nine other prisoners of the British state in Northern Ireland in 1981. One year later, they launched, for electoral advantage, the war against Argentina over the Malvinas/Falkland islands, during which the retreating ARA General Belgrano light cruiser was deliberately sunk outside the exclusion zone arbitrarily imposed by the UK, at the cost of 323 lives. Thatcher's South Atlantic adventure led to 900 deaths and forever scarred the lives of many more.
Portrayed as the “Iron Lady”, Thatcher's great advantage, which accounted for all their much vaunted victories, was that they only ever confronted enemies that were determined to lose.
This was certainly the case with the Argentine Junta. And most important of all, their assault on the working class enjoyed the active support of the labour and trade union bureaucracy. Electorally they relied on the formation of the Social Democratic Party by a section of the Labour Party to stay in power, but above all they depended on the systematic demobilisation of mass opposition to their government by Labour in alliance with the Trades Union Congress.
This reached its climax in the isolation and betrayal of the year-long miners' strike in 1984-85, during which some 20,000 miners were injured, 13,000 arrested, 200 imprisoned, almost 1,000 summarily sacked, and two were killed on picket lines.
The miners' defeat was the signal for the open abandonment by the trade unions and Labour of any defence of the social interests of the working class. “New realism” became the code-word for renouncing any notion of class struggle and workers' solidarity, the embrace of the “free market” and Labour's transformation into an overt right-wing party of big business.
Even as Labour was busy adopting “Thatcherism”, however, their perspective was unravelling.
In the absence of any opposition from the Labour Party and the unions, it was left to their own deeply-divided party to unceremoniously dump them in 1990 in order to stave off electoral disaster. By then, the socially destructive consequences of Thatcher's retrograde economic and social nostrums were all too apparent. In little more than a decade, the conditions of the working class had been sharply reversed in the interests of the financial aristocracy. Whole areas of the country had been turned into industrial wastelands, scarred by poverty and low-wage employment. Britain was well on the way to being transformed into a global centre for the criminal activities of the super-rich—a haven for the likes of Rupert Murdoch and innumerable Russian oligarchs.
Intellectual and cultural life was degraded almost beyond recognition.
In the ensuing years, the unstable foundations of the Thatcherite economic model—the massive accumulation of fictitious capital, unrelated to any development of economic production, and an explosion in credit-fuelled debt—were to produce a series of crises on the global stock markets. Nonetheless, Thatcher's policies were continued and deepened by Labour under Tony Blair, their self-proclaimed political heir.
Much more can and will be said. But five years on from the 2008 financial crash, with mass austerity the order of the day, any objective appraisal makes clear that Thatcher's real legacy is the greatest economic and social crisis wrought by capitalism since the first half of the 20th century.
Nothing whatsoever remains of their stupid and wholly insincere promises of “popular capitalism”, of Britain as a “home-owning democracy” with prosperity for all secured through the “trickle-down” of wealth and the “miracle of the market.” Posterity will record them as having presided over the initial stages of an on-going putrefaction of bourgeois social and political life.
Julie Hyland and Chris Marsden
So, Glastonbury. How was yours? Mine was pretty good. I was standing just off-stage when Jessie J encouraged that little girl from the crowd to join them for a duet of Price Tag. Watching the delight on their faces, I suffered an uncharacteristic fit of emotion and wept with sheer joy, crying all the fluid out of my skull in the process, which was rough on my brain: it became so desiccated and sore it hurt to think about anything other than ice cubes. A short while later someone stuffed an unmarked pill into my hand and in my addled state, I foolishly swallowed it. Twenty minutes later my palms felt like they were made of static electricity and I couldn't tell whether my legs were my own or someone else's I was standing inside by mistake. Reality itself had been hacked and inverted by Lulzsec. Six hours later I lay vomiting in the mud while listening to Mumford & Sons, trying to work out which was worse.
Obviously none of the above actually happened because I didn't actually go to Glastonbury. But since this is a special edition of G2, with the word "Glastonbury" running through it like a cheeky slogan through a stick of rock, anything non-Glastonbury would stand out like a dog in a sandwich. At the time of writing, I'm not sure what the news in the paper will consist of, but even if there's a nuclear war in Canada, chances are someone'll shoehorn a Glastonbury reference into it. "The deadly fireball erupted with the ferocity of a million blazing suns . . . the world hasn't witnessed a lightshow this spectacular since U2's Friday headline slot at Glastonbury."
I caught a bit of U2's set. I don't know if you noticed, but the BBC had a few cameras at Glastonbury this year. You could watch kiddy acts on BBC3, paunchy legends on BBC4, and mainstream brands on BBC2. U2 are so massive they stretched across both BBC2 and 4. Prior to the act taking the stage, three separate groups of presenters threw to each other in a series of apparently random outside broadcast links, followed by a pre-recorded burst of the Vaccines, who I couldn't be arsed getting into. This is one of the benefits of ageing. Then U2 took the stage and everybody cheered. Why?
Several years ago I wrote an article in which I pondered the mystery of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who somehow managed to be one of the biggest bands in the world despite apparently having no fans whatsoever. I based my theory, which I admit may be flawed, on personal experience: since I'd never met one person who claimed to like them, I decided the whole thing had to be a sinister con. Or possibly something to do with dark matter.
Well, U2 are the same. I've never met anyone claiming to be a fan. Statistically there should be millions of U2-mad individuals in Britain – so where are they? Are they hiding? Why are they hiding? What are they hiding? OK, everyone secretly likes One and The Sweetest Thing, and Stuck in a Moment, and . . . hang on, I'm supposed to be taking the piss out of U2 here, so I'd better mention Bono.
I only watched about 10 minutes of U2's set because I find Bono so annoying. I'm aware this is an experience almost as universal as knowing what wearing a T-shirt feels like, but still: it's true. It's not their fault. Well, OK, it is – but even that isn't their fault. Anyway, they wore their trademark Bono sunglasses and I've become so accustomed to seeing them in them, I've come to believe they're actually part of their face. At one point I thought they were sweating through their glasses, before I realised it was drizzle. Not drizzle, rain. Apparently it was raining like a tantrum in a piss factory. The sky was disrespecting Bono. For some reason, it's funny that it rained during U2. It just is.
The following day, the screens were far sunnier, which was almost enough to cause a glimmer of jealousy until I remembered the mud. Glastonbury looks like amazing fun if you're 23 and running around covered in glitter. I'm not 23, I hate tents, I dislike any form of discomfort or even mild inconvenience, I prefer recorded music to live gigs and I rarely drink any more, so it's Good But It's Good Not For Me. I wish I'd gone when I was 23, but I didn't. I was too busy lying stoned on a sofa in west London to bother upping sticks to lie stoned in a yurt in west Britain. I've been once, in my 30s, on behalf of the Guardian, and it was all pleasant enough, but so is jam on toast. It's a town the size of Bath! And so is Bath.
Here was an interesting thing I discovered during Glastonbury 2011: did you know when BBC2 goes off-air at 2am, the BBC sometimes still shows Pages from Ceefax? It's like someone's plugged a BBC Micro into your TV. I think it was showing headlines from 1956. Incredible it still works. They probably have to type all the stories on a calculator and save them to a 3.5-inch floppy disk and upload them to Ceefax's 128Kb memory.
Anyway: Glastonbury. Next week, more Glastonbury, unless you're lucky and there's a nuclear war.
Telltale Games is a somewhat controversial video-game developer while simultaneously being one of the most popular currently out there. This is because they're doing something which few other video-game developers are doing: producing high-quality but reasonable-budget adventure games that focus on storytelling over gameplay. Unfortunately, some people believe they've put too much focus on this element to the point that many gamers don't believe their products are games at all but are rather barely-interactive movies.
The controversy over this is especially noteworthy with their spin-off of the HBO's Game of Thrones series, created in 2014, and which will have a sequel called Game of Thrones: Season Two some time in 2018. Yes, this means that it's a spin-off of a spin-off which will have its own Season Two. This would be funny if not for the fact that there are currently five spin-offs being worked on at HBO with George R.R. Martin's help. I wonder if one of them will receive its own Telltale video-game adaptation.
Telltale's Game of Thrones is not an adaptation of any elements from A Song of Ice and Fire but an original story set in Westeros, roughly during season 3 of the television show, after Joffrey has consolidated their power and become engaged to Margaery Tyrell. It starts, indeed, during the Red Wedding and continues until just after the so-called Purple Wedding. This is, now, a bit dated and potentially spoilery but it is as good a time as any in the series to set one's drama. The North has been beaten down, King's Landing is full of treacherous intrigue and Ramsey Bolton is now heir to the North.
Book readers may be a bit thrown by the fact that this is very much a sequel to the television show and not A Song of Ice and Fire as some of the events depicted in the game are inconsistent with the backstory of George R.R. Martin's books. Robb Stark's army is set to attack Casterly Rock rather than return to the North, House Forrester are bannermen to House Stark rather than House Glover, and House Forrester knights their soldiers despite that being a tradition of the Seven. If you are able to rise above treating the text like a Medieval theologian, these are minor issues at best.
As befitting a story adapted from Game of Thrones, you play multiple characters across numerous locations. These include Smallfolk-born knight, Gared Tuttle, several members of House Forrester's male line, and Mira Forrester who serves as a handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell. After the Red Wedding, the Forresters' fortunes fall far and they are subject to reprisals by their traditional rivals in the Whitehill family. The Whitehills are Bolton bannermen and desire to seize the Forrester's ironwood groves so they can rebuild their own failing fortunes. Ramsey Bolton, psychopath that they are, finds the entire conflict amusing rather than something they should intervene as a lord in order to prevent it (or side with their loyal bannermen over).
The goal of the game is to play the game of thrones by politicking your way through various scenarios both in the North, King's Landing, the Wall, and even in Essos. The Essos sections are notable for the fact they take a radically different approach to the rest of the game and mostly involve slicing your way through enemies like a more traditional video game. Generally, the choices are framed in the context of either keeping your dignity and honor or using every available means to acquire the resources you need to protect your family. It's the choice of Robb Stark writ large where you can be a good person but an awful politician or an awful politician but a smart ruler or some combination thereof.
Perhaps my favorite sections of the game are the sections where I play as Mira, mostly because they're so different from what I normally get to play in video games. Mira has no combat experience and is meant to be a demure, shy lady of the court. Them section is primarily about playing a submissive role while gathering intelligence, begging favors, kissing up to the right people and manipulating by words. One of the best moments in the game is where you steal Margaery Tyrell's seal and use it to forge documents to assist your family.
Are there flaws? Oh yes, unfortunately so. The Forresters are a transparent stand-in for the Stark family to the point where most of its members are mix-and-match expys. One character is mostly like Bran, another character like Sansa, another like Catelyn, another like Jon, and so on. They're not identical but they're so damned close that it feels weird when you interact with Jon Snow at the Wall. Also, the asupervisorstioned “interactive movie” flaw is in force. You can generally determine how you react to events but you can do very little to change them. Finally, Ramsey Snow is a character who has protection from the plot since he's a major character in the show until Season 6's finale.
But is it grimdark? Yes, it is and one of the more subdued and well-written examples of the genre in video games. While the Forresters can be played as the noble, honest, and salt-of-the-Earth types, like the Starks are, you can also play them as duplicitous snakes. Playing the good guy or bad guy doesn't really help you either way but the latter path does mean you can hurt your enemies worse. Characters die left and right in horrible ways, including children as well as playable characters. While it is frustrating to play in increments, it works well when played all together.
I rate this game 4 Bannermen out of 5.
(CNN) Time and time again we hear that distinctive buzz.
It seems these days, anyone -- with a few hundred dollars to spare -- can be a proud owner of a small, recreational unmanned aircraft.
And when you hear that telltale hum, it's more than likely from a camera drone made by China's DJI.
The company behind the sleek Phantom is the leader in consumer drones with well over 70% of the global market
"We innovated with our Phantoms, with our drone line and with our professional line of cinema equipment," DJI product manager Paul Pan tells me at company headquarters in Shenzhen.
"It comes down to us being seen not as a Chinese company but as an international player."
The China advantage
JUST WATCHED Drone maker DJI explains why being in China has given it a leg-up on the competition. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Drone maker DJI explains why being in China has given it a leg-up on the competition. 02:10
Though DJI underplays its Chinese origins with its Western-friendly corporate branding, the company admits that being based in Shenzhen has been a big factor behind its success.
"We base our technology, manufacturing and our R&D here in China because everything is much more accessible, making it quicker to develop products," says Pan.
Based in China's so-called "maker capital," DJI can essentially design a part in the morning and then drive to a nearby factory to see it manufactured that afternoon.
Less restrictive regulations also makes it easier for DJI to get their drones in the air in China.
"It's easier to go out and just test and fly here," says Pan. "If you're in the U.S., you have to get licensing to be able to do things commercially."
That said, China recently announced a curb on exports of advanced drones, a move to tighten control over technologies that are key to national security.
DJI has insisted the export restrictions will not impact any of its core products, which are geared more for consumer use.
New drone applications
But the line between consumer and commercial use is blurring as the global uptake in recreational drones drives new applications in a wide array of industries from logistics to the media.
Amazon is one of a number of companies that's looking to use drones to deliver packages, and CNN has joined a trial program to help U.S. authorities for rules about how companies can use drones.
DJI's American rival 3D Robotics touts a more "open platform" approach to drone technology. Its CEO believes that gives their firm a major advantage in emerging commercial markets.
JUST WATCHED Making drones smarter with software Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Making drones smarter with software 01:04
"There are so many different applications that require expertise in the individual industry that it's being used in," says 3D Robotics CEO Chris Anderson.
"Specialists in areas like agriculture are looking for a drone with the ability to add their specialty to an open platform. That is what wins."
But DJI is adapting. It recently released its hackable M100 drone -- a flying platform for third-party software developers to add new functionality like thermal scanning.
As its eyes remain fixed on its largest market, the United States, the U.S. government has allowed a limited number of companies to test commercial applications for drones... including DJI.
But, according to one analyst, being a Chinese company could prove to be a problem.
"They will get blocked out a bit from getting involved in government projects," says Colin Snow of Drone Analyst Research and Advisors. "NASA, for instance, is prohibited from doing any work directly with DJI as it has to work with its partners."
"So, in the commercial world where we'll see more and more aircraft being developed, the disadvantage is there for DJI."
Today's consumer drone can film spectacular vistas. But tomorrow, entire drone fleets could monitor crop growth, deliver medicines, and film disaster zones in real time.
The rise of consumer drones may have started in China with flying hobbyist cameras, but the "drone age" will soar ahead with or without DJI.
Search Continues for Missing Monkey in N.H.
Search Continues for Missing Monkey in N.H. See web page for video footage: http://www.whdh.com/news/local6.shtml DANVILLE, N.H. -- Roughly a dozen people, including Fire Chief David Kimball, say they recently saw a large monkey on the loose in this small town of 3,800 people in southern New Hampshire. "I couldn't believe what I was seeing," they said. Neither could their wife. "She told me I had flipped when I told her." Kimball said they were driving through town recently when the monkey jumped into the middle of the street, hopped a bit, then lunged away. On Sunday volunteers and animal control officers used bananas and oranges to try to attract the monkey. Experts hope to capture the monkey before it gets any cooler. They said otherwise the creature is unlikely to live past November. Kimball thinks they identified the monkey as a Humbolt's woolly monkey, which is native to the Amazon, after watching television programs on the Adventure Channel. "It would be quite tall, maybe about four feet, if it were standing straight up, but they walk on all fours, a bit hunched over," they said. They described the creature as very woolly and dark brown all over with a red hue. Kimball said they think somebody in the area was keeping the monkey as a pet, but won't admit it escaped because it is illegal to keep monkeys in New Hampshire. They said their research indicated Humbolt monkeys supposedly make good pets. They said it is legal to purchase monkeys in Massachusetts. Kimball said they know of at least eight other people who have spotted the monkey around town. "They're all getting the same reaction when they tell someone they've seen it," they said. "People tell them they're crazy." The chief said the town's animal control officer has contacted a wildlife expert, who has expressed interest in trying to trap the monkey. "Fish and Game had no interest in it because it's not a native animal," Kimball said. Animal Control Officer Denise Laratondo said they are trying to find the monkey's home. "We aren't going to press any charges," they said. "We just want to do what's best for this animal and keep it alive." They also said it is best that people not try to capture the monkey. "Please let the experts handle it," they said. (AP) --------------------------------- Do You Yahoo!? Get email alerts & NEW webcam video instant messaging with Yahoo!

When your apartment doubles as your office, a workday can decay into a deserted arena for rival compulsions. Eventually you need to be among people again. That's why I head to the movie theater at weird hours, seeking some semblance of ceremony. One ticket buys the ability to be privately public. Without companions nearby, the conversation becomes visual: I glance at the whispers and flirtations in the audience, at those people leaving early, the ones staying serenely behind. I listen to the crickety rustle of popcorn. I run my fingers over oxblood velvet. Whether you're in church or in a theater, sometimes the frescoes are prettier than the liturgy.
I don't buy into the rather precious notion of cinema as ritual, at least not the solemn kind. A laptop or a smartphone has its uses, and its charms. I'm just too distractible to relax in front of a computer screen by myself — it always feels like research. The piety of moviegoing is ahistoric, anyway. Orson Welles once described how it was in the 1930s: “You strolled down the street and sallied into the theater at any hour of the day or night. Like you'd go in to have a drink at a bar. Every movie theater was partially empty. We never asked what time the movie began.” You'd leave when you realized the reels had wound back to the point at which you entered. As late as 1960, Hitchcock could use “no latecomers” as a novel marketing gimmick for “Psycho.”
The studios have since become mere adornments of multinational conglomerates, producing films merged into “cinematic universes,” and the theaters have consolidated, too. They are fewer but more elaborate. And to counter the routine of streaming something or other whenever, both multiplexes and art houses increasingly frame every screening as an exclusive occasion. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” sold $100 million in advance tickets, more than all but a couple of dozen films grossed over their entire domestic runs last year. Manhattan's new Metrograph is a distant corner of the industry, where you can see beautiful restorations of Dorothy Arzner pictures from an assigned seat, and they sell every ticket that way. Such convenient hassles will never feel quite like sidling spontaneously into a cinema alone, the moth circling the marquee's light.
New Warhammer 40,000: A Forge World Datasheet!
Well, yesterday was exciting, wasn't it?
Amidst the massive line-up of new releases due for pre-order on the 3rd of June were the Forge World Imperial Armour Index books for Space Marines and their traitorous counterparts.
We haven't really talked about Forge World miniatures in the new Warhammer 40,000 yet, but now that the new books are confirmed, let's take a look at a datasheet from one.
This guy is a Leviathan Dreadnought. And more than that, a Chaos one! The traitor's look like they have opened up their 10,000-year-old vault of Legion Dreadnoughts for the new Warhammer 40,000. Against those new Primaris Space Marines, we're sure Chaos players will appreciate the reinforcement.
Just a cursory glance at the stats on this guy, and we can see that they are an absolute monster! Some of the larger walkers, which previously fell a little short of super-heavy status in the last edition, do very well out of the new Warhammer 40,000 (Orks also do pretty well here).
Kitted out either for combat, shooting or a mix of both, this Dreadnought is going to wreck face. All of those weapons are looking like good options. There's even a ranged weapon that kicks out mortal wounds – one of only a handful in the entire game. We think we're veering towards a grav-flux bombard and hellforged siege drill as our favourite kit though. You're budding Chaos Lords will have to decide for yourselves.
And that's just one unit in one of the two Forge World Index books accompanying the launch of the new edition. And there will be more Index books on the way very soon after for other Forge World Imperial as well as xenos units.
We'll be back tomorrow with a look at missions and objectives in the new edition.
These are two potential compensation curves that may be derived from this experiment: The overall sum of measurements from the stereo pair; and the combined left and right ear response when listening to the left speaker only. There may be others.
I don't think I'd make a very good researcher. I get too pissed when the numbers don't look like I'd like. Guess that's why so many engineers are less in touch with their feelings than the average Joe. Oh well, here we go.
First I'll show you all the data.
Test Description
In this test, a 256 point stepped sweep was performed from 20Hz to 20kHz. The head was positioned at the reference listening point and fifteen measurements were made at different angular positionsazimuth angles (left to right) were +/-20, +/-10, and 0 degrees; these measurements were repeated with the head level, and tilted up and down 10 degrees. Left and right ear data were taken as separate files.
The speakers were set up in the room to provide the Harman preferred listening EQ. Here's a plot from a measurement microphone used to set up the the room for my visit.
Data recorded from the head was stored in Excel spreadsheets, one for each angle. The raw data was quite noisy. In my initial previous post, I smoothed the data with a moving average filter that I can manage to pull of in Excel. Good for a rough idea of what's going on, but not good for developing a compensation curve that doesn't have a lot of weird artifacts in it.
Fortunately, I know Arnaud well enough that I knew they might give me a hand with a bit of complex best-fit curve fitting math that can't be done in Excel...which they agreed to do (bless their nerdly heart). On all the data shown here, Arnaud has used a "d-2/xhat-6OB" Tikhonov 1/6th Octave Band smoothing derivative 2 best-fit filter. Don't ask me what that means...hell, don't ask Arnuad for an exact meaning. Here's what they wrote me:
Started looking at smoothing functions:
- I used open source code Octave and some data-smoothing package that was made available for a kind soul.
- I have to be honest with you and I am not a math guy per say so I could not explain the method in detail, but description of the package here mentions about Tikhonov regularization.
- I also tried the "standard" interpolation function using spline method (interp1 mentioned before)
- After interpolation, the curves go through a second fit (cubic interpolation using interp1 function) in order to get back to the original frequency resolution (e.g. so that you can use these directly in Excel to normalize all your existing spreadsheets)
- All interpolations are made directly in dBU scale, which is the way to go I think because your data is quite jaggy (would have helped to perform longer averages but time was of essence I assume)
Have played a bit today with the various options using 3 files and have attached the results.
- "d-" value corresponds to smoothing derivative used to perform smoothing (Tikhonov method)
- "xhat-12OB" is the best fit to 1/12th Octave Band set of frequencies (Tikhonov method)
- "xhat-6OB" is the best fit to 1/6th Octave Band set of frequencies (Tikhonov method)
- "gcv" is magic to me, could not tell you what it does (Tikhonov method). Besides, it does not systematically converge (iterative method) and you'll notice some blue color curves that do not seem smoothed (failed at 50 iterations…)
- "spline-6OB" uses a spline interpolation method onto 1/6th Octave band set of frequencies (standard interp1 function)
From what I have seen so far, "d-2/xhat-6OB" interpolation is the one to go for (red color curve in …_SmoothingTest4.png).
Here's one of the plots they sent. They modified about 30 spreadsheets for this project. Thank you, mate.
I then took all Arnauds data and re-built and modified my pre-existing spreadsheets to be able to display an array of summary data. We'll start with the stereo data with both speakers active.
Stereo Response Tests
The above plot shows the left (top) and right (bottom) ear family of plots for movements in azimuth (left to right). At each angle, measurements from the three elevation angles are averaged to provide some angular averaging to remove fine features from the HRTF (head related transfer function).
A few things to notice right off the bat:
I would have expected the bass to come down to the 0dB line by 150Hz. The room tuning clearly shows a shelf in the bass that ends at 200Hz. Looking back at the initial data, it seems the best fit smoothing algorithm is extending the bass boost curve upward in frequency and taking too much detail out of the bass profile.
The right ear (bottom traces) shows a significantly more apparent downward inflection as the curve rises between 1kHz and 3kHz. Keep an eye on this area as it seems pretty lively in the measurements. Something is going on here and I know not what.
I've really liked how the presence and coherence of vocals improve when I EQ to match the tonal profile of the Harman curve (below) in the 200Hz to 3Khz area. The recorded data shows the Harman curve might need a little tweak to raise the peak to 3.5kHz and re-shape the inflection at 2kHz a bit for application with my head.
It's very clear to me from these measurements that the prescribed ever-increasing fall in response above the 3.5kHz peak prescribed by the preliminary Harman target response (shown above) does not match my head's response.
While the fall from 3.5kHz to 7kHz is very similar as head angle changes, the the area above 7kHz seems quite effected by angular change. We'll see this more clearly in the left speaker only data.
The above plot show the family of measurements of the left and right ear for up and down movement. Each plot is the average of all left to right movement of the head at each elevation.
Generally speaking, the plots don't show much change except for the area between roughly 600Hz and 3kHz. In that area there is significant change...especially at that 2kHz inflection. Maybe...just maybe...there's a null in the room at 2kHz near the right ear and as I tip the head up and down the ear moves nearer and farther from the null. Dunno.
The above plot shows the sum of all measurements combined for the left and right ear, and the sum of both ears together. This, it seems to me, is a reasonable candidate for a headphone compensation curve for my head. I continue to dislike the bass bump extending to 400Hz, however. That's never sounded right to me...I'm going to have to do something about that.
Left Speaker Only Response Tests
The above plot show the family of measurements for azimuth changes of the left and right ear with only the left speaker playing. Each plot is the average of all up and down movement of the head at each azimuth angle.
It's cool when things look as expected, and the above plot is cool in that way. First notice the peak at 3.5kHz: This peak occurs due to the sound focusing effect of the concha bowl (the small bowl around the entrance to the ear canal). The left ear is variously facing the left speaker, and you can see that it is quite stable at achieving the needed gain on that side of the head to hear sounds at this frequencylike a twig snap. (Evidence of evolutionor Godhelping us hear the approaching tiger?)
But the right ear, on the far side of the head from the left speaker, is shadowed from the directly propagating sonic wavefront of the speaker, so is ever more unable to focus the sound and looses gain. Yet another psychoacoustic cue to know where that sound just came from.
Higher resolution localizing cues are to be found in the area above 7kHz. This is a noisy area, but if you look closely you can see the trends. The first thing to ignore is the dip and bump at 11kHz and 13kHz. These occur from a tertiary resonant mode in the ear canal. All the plots show evidence of itthe more direct the sound into the ear canal, the more pronounced the wiggle. Just smooth it out in your head.
Now look carefully at the area between 7kHz and 10kHz and compare it to the area above 10Khz. What I see is that as the face of the dummy head is ever more pointing directly toward the speaker, the stuff 10kHz to 15kHz rises, but between 7Khz and 10kHz it sort of falls off. Essentially, the tilt in response above 7kHz goes upward as you face the speaker and downward as you turn away. As you directly face a sound source, the top octave tips up; as you turn away, it rapidly falls off. If you want to hear very high frequency sounds, I guess you should face directly towards them.
It seems to me, when looking at the plots so far, the data shows that the fall after 3.5kHz should end at about 7kHz 3dB above the midrange baseline, then remain about flat 'til 15kHz at which point it may roll off. This is substantially different than the Harman target response.
Very interesting to me is that I know this response would be too bright for my personal tastes. The Audeze SINE has a fairly similar response, and while I knew it would be a lot of people's cup of tea, it was still too bright in those top octaves for me.
This exercise has given me new insight into where neutral is, and a more precise understanding of my preference for a more laid back sound. I will certainly be dialing that into my understanding of how to review headphones more fairly when my taste drags me away from neutral. John Atkinson brought up our differing appreciation for the treble range in their LCD-4 review, and they like this profile much more than I.
One interesting thing to keep in mind though is that if the area above 7kHz is tipped up, it may be that we begin to perceive the sound as coming from more directly in front of us. This may psychoacoustically narrow the stereo image as the sound is perceived as coming from more directly in front, rather than 30 degrees to the side. May!
The above plot show the family of measurements of the left and right ear for up and down movement with the left speaker playing. Each plot is the average of all left to right movement of the head at each elevation. Nothing too terribly important here, but a couple things worthy of note.
The inflection at 2kHz seems to be more pronounced in the left channel where in other data it seems to be more pronounced on the right. No idea why this is so.
It's clear that the region above 7kHz is tipped up in the left ear, and downward in the right, reinforcing the idea the more your head is turned toward the speaker, the more this region tips up.
The above plot shows the average of all measurements from the left and right ear with the left speaker playing. The right ear show a clear loss of concha gain relative to the left ear, which faces the speaker. Again, above 7kHz the left ear is tipped up and the right ear rolls off.
The top green plot is the sum of both curves. This is the second potential plot I will consider as a compensation curves for my system. With speakers, both ears hear both speakers. The left ear hears both the left and right speaker. It's (somewhat) reasonable to assume that the right ear hearing the left speaker will be quite similar in response to the left ear hearing the right speaker. Therefor, adding the left and right channels together on this plot may be like the left ear hearing two speakers and is therefore a reasonable model for a compensation curve.
The above plot shows the averaging of all measurements in the stereo test to those measured with the left speaker only. It may be reasonable to assume that the difference in these to curves comes mostly from having two speakers playing in the room vs. one. Bass increase due to the confinement of long wavelength sounds may account for the added bass of the stereo plot. I have no rational guess as to why the area between 500Hz and 3kHz looses response with the stereo signalmaybe acoustic cancelations at those frequencies? (Wild-ass guesses in the comments are welcome!)
In the coming week I will try to contact and get comments on these findings from some of the (much better educated in the field than I) researchers and engineers who have been following along and helping me through this process. I will summarize and report later.
For now, I've taken a first quick stab at compensating a few headphones with the two above empirically derived curves. The following plots show the Audeze LCD-4, and Sennheiser HD 800 and HD 600, compensated with both the stereo and left channel only total sum curves shown above. The left channel of each headphone (top blue trace) is compensated with the stereo data; the right channel (top red trace) is compensated with the left speaker data.
I'd love to hear your which you prefer and why in the comments. (Note that the HD 600 looks like there is more difference in the compensations; this is happening because the channel matching of that headphone is a bit off.)

Further Steps
As I mentioned, I'll be reporting back on comments from engineers, but I'd like to do a few more things.
I'll be asking Arnaud for a little more help. I want to see if they can play around with the smoothing algorithm coefficients to get some more detail back in the bass. Also, the gathered data sets aren't exactly the same size and length as the headphone data I gather. Data was gathered for this experiment from 20Hz to 20kHz in 256 log steps; my headphone measurements are 10Hz to 22kHz in 512 steps. We'll need to convert the curves above into ones I can just tip into my spreadsheets. (I did a crude scale conversion by hand for this article, but want a really clean one for further exploration.)
Once I have some usable compensation curves in hand, I will produce a series of graphs showing the raw response; responses compensated with the two above plots; a Harman target response compensation; and with diffuse field, free field, and independent of direction compensations. I'll do this for maybe a dozen headphones, and then I'll post each headphone plot as a poll in which readers can vote on which compensation curve they think best represents each headphone. This should give us some interesting feedback on these curves.
That's it for now.
This week I ended up with an advance copy of Influence Central's new report called Kids & Tech: The Evolution of Today's Digital Natives. The report—which is a subsection from a larger, ongoing study of 500 women across the USA—details findings on the way that kids are using technology and reveals several interesting insights. The highlights include:
The average age for a child getting their first smartphone is now 10.3 years
Tablets have surged from 26% to 55% usage as kids' device of choice during car rides. Smartphones trail at 45% (up from 39% in 2012).
64% of kids have access to the Internet via their own laptop or tablet, compared to just 42% in 2012
39% of kids get a social media account at 11.4 years. 11% got a social media account when they were younger than 10.
Additionally, some Influence Central's research paints a picture of parents who are relaxing a little bit about their kids' access to the internet which is enabled by so many devices.
While 85% accessed the Internet from a room shared with the family in 2012, that number dropped to 76% today, and 24% now have “private” access from their bedrooms (compared to 15% in 2012.)
I had not heard of Influence Central prior to receiving this report, so I reached out with a few questions. Specifically, I asked company CEO/Founder Stacy DeBroff about the fact that when I Google the term “average age a child receives a cell phone” at least one report from 2015 pins the age at 6 or 7 years, not 10 (although there is some speculation out there about the legitimacy of that other report originally conducted by someone called vouchercloud).
In any event, DeBroff responded that while they can't comment on other report findings, their own study was specifically focused on children's smartphone ownership and not just feature phones or kid-specific phones. The question asked in their 70 question survey was actually “if you purchased a smartphone/cellphone for your child, what age was the child.”
They continued by saying that they felt like, in the past, mobile phones were merely used by kids to have voice contact with their parents. These days, kids increasingly use them for a host of activities beyond simple contact with parents like games or productivity, enabled by smartphones.
I also inquired why the study participants were only mothers and not also fathers? DeBroff replied that that was in order to maintain consistency with the 2012 report for which this was a follow up. It was not the same, exact 500 women in this new survey, but rather similar sample of women in the same life stage as the previous study.
Some things that remain unclear are whether this new-found smartphone ownership is also tied to independent wireless accounts (e.g. kids have their own phone numbers and data plans) or whether they are just hand-me-down smartphones using Wi-Fi capabilities. The survey question did not go into this level of detail.
Regardless, it makes sense to me that device usage would increase. With many adults getting new smartphones every year, there is surely an inventory of recent, capable smartphones going unused in households.
I also should note that Influence Central is a marketing agency — and their interpretation of the data is that kids' mobile savvy is an important behavior for brands to consider as they think about how to communicate with them both now and in the future. Mobility is a way of life to which they are easily accustomed.
It is somewhat sad to me that my nostalgic memory of childhood—digging in the dirt, riding bikes or playing soccer, unattended, in the street—could be replaced by a portrait of kids who look just like their parents with their noses buried in a smartphone. At the same time, there is no denying that today's kids are more capable than ever and are merely adapting to the tools available to them. To shun these tools also doesn't make much sense.
I suppose it always just comes down to life balance. But as a smartphone junkie myself (and parent of a ten-year-old with a smartphone and data account), I'm not trying to be your spiritual advisor here about parenting dos and don'ts. But the data speaks for itself and it's not going to do any good to ignore it.
This article is about an emotion. For the album, see Oceanic Feeling (album)
In a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, Romain Rolland coined the phrase "oceanic feeling" to refer to the sensation of being one with the universe.[1] According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.[2] Freud discusses the feeling in their Future of an Illusion (1927) and Civilization and Its Discontents (1929). There they deem it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated themselves or themselves from other people and things.[3]
History [ edit ]
On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a letter to Freud:
Mais j'aurais aimé à vous voir faire l'analyse du sentiment religieux spontané ou, plus exactement, de la sensation religieuse qui est...le fait simple et direct de la sensation de l'Eternel (qui peut très bien n'être pas éternel, mais simplement sans bornes perceptibles, et comme océanique).[4]
In strict translation:
But I would have liked to see you doing an analysis of spontaneous religious sentiment or, more exactly, of religious feeling, which is...the simple and direct fact of the feeling of the ‘eternal' (which can very well not be eternal, but simply without perceptible limits, and like oceanic, as it were).[5]
Freud ends The Future of an Illusion with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of Civilization and Its Discontents, answering Rolland's request. There they credit the concept to an anonymous friend.
Freud's explanation [ edit ]
Freud argues that the "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the preserved "primitive ego-feeling" from infancy. The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it. Therefore, the infant has no concept of a "self" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist. Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the "oceanic feeling" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.
Neuroscientific explanation [ edit ]
"Neurotheology" is a neologism that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:[6] the perception that time, fear or self-consciousness have dissolved; spiritual awe; oneness with the universe; ecstatic trance; sudden enlightenment; and altered states of consciousness.
What Andrew B. Newberg and others "discovered is that intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that Buddhists call oneness with the universe."[7]

Belgian police fired water cannon to disperse a large group of demonstrators who stormed a central Brussels square.
They invaded the Place de la Bourse as people paid tribute at a makeshift memorial for victims of last Tuesday's deadly attacks.
Riot police intervened to try to restore order after the group confronted Muslim women in the crowds, made Nazi salutes and chanted.
The attacks at Brussels airport and on the metro killed 28 people.
A "march against fear" planned for Sunday was called off after the authorities said it would strain police resources for the investigation.
Belgian police also carried out 13 new raids and took more people in for questioning on Sunday as part of investigations into the attacks.
A man already in Belgian custody was reported to have been charged in connection with a foiled attack in the Paris region.
Separately, Dutch police announced on Sunday evening that they had detained a Frenchman, 32, in Rotterdam at the request of French authorities.
They were arrested on suspicion of preparing an attack in France and will be extradited to the country. Three other people were also detained.
The Frenchman is allegedly linked to Reda Kriket, who was arrested in a Paris suburb on Thursday and said to be in the "advanced stage" of plotting an attack, AFP news agency reported citing a police source.
It is the latest in a series of arrests across Europe that police say are linked to planned or actual attacks.

The BBC's Anna Holligan in Brussels says the group involved in the demonstration actually call themselves Casuals against Terrorism - not Fascists against Terrorism as earlier reported.
Some of the hundreds-strong group wore balaclavas and anonymous masks. Many wore black clothing. Some reports described them as football hooligans.
One of them, called Andres, told AFP news agency: "We are football hooligans, we don't have anything to do with politics."
"We are here for the victims and to pay our respects," they said.
AFP said about 10 people were arrested.
'Appalled'
One witness, Adam Liston, told the BBC there had been a "really positive atmosphere" in the square, as people crowded round the floral tributes in solidarity with the victims.
"Then a bunch of skinheads just turned up, marched into the square, and started a major confrontation with the peace protesters. They got in the face of the protesters and police. They set off flares and chanted and it was getting quite ugly," they said.
They added that although it had been "pretty non-violent", it looked like it "could have kicked off".
The Belgian prime minister and the city mayor have strongly condemned the behaviour.
"I am appalled by what is happening, to learn that such thugs have come to provoke residents at the site of their memorial," said Brussels mayor Yvan Mayeur.
PM Charles Michel said it was "highly inappropriate that protesters have disrupted the peaceful reflection at the Bourse (stock exchange)".

IBM, in collaboration with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has developed 'lab-on-a-chip' technology that will be used to test for prostate cancer.
According to the journal Nature Nanotechnology, the IBM team's results show size-based separation of bioparticles down to 20 nanometers in diameter. At this scale, scientists can access and separate particles such as DNA, viruses, and exosomes.
Once separated, the particles can be analyzed by physicians to potentially reveal signs of disease "even before patients experience any physical symptoms and when the outcome from treatment is most positive", IBM said.
Until now, the smallest bioparticle that could be separated by size using on-chip technologies was about 50 or more times larger.
The two teams say that they will continue development of the lab-on-a-chip technology and, to begin with, they plan to test for one of the most common cancers, cancer of the prostate.
What the scientists are trying to do is a form of eavesdropping on cells. This new ability to sort bioparticles at the nanoscale can allow the scientists to 'hear' the messages carried by exosomes for cell-to-cell communications. This can make clear important questions about the biology of diseases and, "pave the way for noninvasive and eventually affordable point-of-care diagnostic tools", the scientists say. "Monitoring the intercellular conversation more regularly could allow medical experts to track an individual's state of health or progression of a disease."
Image: IBM Zurich
Lab-on-a-chip technologies are becoming a better way for doctors and research scientists to build more helpful tools which are faster, portable, and easier to use and require less of a sample to help detect diseases. The goal, IBM and the Mount Sinai scientists say, is to shrink down to a single silicon chip "all of the processes necessary to analyze a disease that would normally be carried out in a full-scale biochemistry lab".
The nanoscale, on-chip technology, called nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement or nano-DLD, has been developed by scientists led by IBM's Joshua Smith and Benjamin Wunsch.
It works by allowing a liquid sample to be passed, in continuous flow, through a silicon chip containing an asymmetric pillar array. "This array allows the system to sort a microscopic waterfall of nanoparticles, separating particles by size down to tens of nanometers resolution," IBM said.
Image: IBM Zurich
IBM says it has already scaled down the chip size to 2cm by 2cm while continuing development to increase the technology density.
It is analogous to "a road through a small tunnel that allows smaller cars to pass while forcing bigger trucks to detour around", IBM said.
A nano-DLD uses a set of pillars to deflect larger particles while allowing smaller particles to flow through the gaps of the pillar array unabated. This effectively separates particle 'traffic' by size while not disrupting flow.
IBM said that nano-DLD arrays can also split a mixture of different particle sizes into a spread of streams, "much like a prism splits white light into different colors".
The continuous flow of this technology contrasts with "the stop-and-go batch processing" that is found in conventional separation techniques, IBM added.

There is nothing like a summer tour across the USA, and we've been on plenty of them dating all the way back to 1994, when we opened for the legendary UK band Lush, driving around in an old conversion van named Betsy.
So much has changed since those days but the main thing that's changed about a weezer concert is that they've sounded better and better, and have been more and more full of fans! This coming summer will be no exception! Come out and rock with us!
It is our distinct pleasure to welcome the Pixies to the stage for this tour. Weezer's origin was in fact very closely linked to the Pixies – no other band had the impact they did on the band's early sound. We've played with them on a handful of occasions since they reformed in the early 2000's and it's always been an honor. Sharing a stage with them for a whole summer is going to be mindblowing. We can't wait to see them, and you!

Israeli settlers attack Palestinian farmer near Hebron
At around 10 am on Saturday, 61-year old farmer Sadik al-Bari was attacked by around 25 Israeli settlers, who surrounded the man and their wife while they were working in their field, and began pelting them with rocks. Al-Bari stated, "I was in my field when suddenly more than 25 people arrived and began to throw stones. They cried 'go away.' Where can I go? I was doing nothing wrong, simply working my land. They covered their faces with their shirts and threw stones at my wife and me. It was the first time I had seen these settlers. They want me to leave, but tomorrow I will go to my field again."
The elderly farmer attempted to file a complaint with the Israeli police department built on illegally occupied Palestinian land near Hebron, but was informed by the officer in charge that the police department was closed. Only after intervention by the Israeli human rights group 'Rabbis for Human Rights' was the station opened to al-Bari in order to file their complaint. In the complaint, al-Bari stated that both they and their wife sustained injuries from the rocks thrown at them by the settlers.
The Israeli police departments located on illegally occupied Palestinian land are given a mandate by the Israeli government to protect the Israeli settlers that have seized Palestinian land in violation of international law. They are, as a result, extremely reticent to pursue investigations of Israeli settler attacks against the Palestinian civilian population. In the Hebron area, attacks on Palestinian civilians by Israeli settlers occur on a daily basis, and investigations of these incidents by Israeli police are extremely rare. The attacks often intensify on Saturdays, when Israeli settlers gather together after prayer services for the Jewish holy day of Shabbat, in order to attack Palestinian civilians who have been living for millenia on land that the Israeli settlers consider to be theirs by 'divine right'.
So, you want to start organized play for the D&D Adventurers League at a store? Why? This isn't rhetorical, this is a question that everyone wanting to organize any sort of organized play must ask.
Why do you want to go through the effort to schedule games, organize Dungeon Masters and players, print out forms, do paperwork, and enter data into Wizards Event Reporter? These questions shouldn't be asked alone. Every one of these things needs to be discussed with the store owner/tournament organizer of the store that you wish to play at.
Anyone wanting to start organized play must also talk to the store owner about why the store would like to host organized play. From experience of running events like D&D Encounters and D&D Expeditions, most stores use the programs to get more players in the store. But, these events can also be used to create new players, or bring players back to the game. These decisions help focus the organizer by guiding how the programs should be run to help the store succeed in those goals and make the organized play a success. The store owner and the organizer both need to be on the same page as to what the desired results are, past the obvious–players having fun. This means there needs to be a constant stream of communication between the store owner and the organizer. This doesn't have to be daily, but should be often enough that both people are on the same page. This is extra important for detailing which person will be doing what at each event, and is doubly important for the scheduling and reporting of events.
The store owner and the organizer need to be very clear about how events will be scheduled, how Dungeon Masters will be organized, and who will be reporting the events. If they are unable to communicate then there is almost no reason to be running anything. The first step is to decide who will be scheduling the events on the Wizards Events Reporter. This person has to make sure that all of the events are scheduled in time to ensure the kits arrive at the store. You can read more information about how stores schedule games: In Store or Store Affiliate Play Options The next step to make sure the DMs are given all the information they need for the events. Besides dates and location there needs to be a way to ensure all the DMs have the adventures in time to learn them beforehand. The person doing this needs to make sure the DMs have enough time to work out any adjustments they may see fit for the adventure. Once the adventures are done they must be reported. And, this needs to be discussed early as well as who takes the information before it is reported. All of these discussions, lead to a well informed and organized structure for starting organized play. Figure this stuff out ahead of time and things become much simpler later on. Early planning makes everything easier. Of course, now you need DMs.
Who Should Dungeon Master?
Finding DMs is likely going to be the hardest part of starting organized play. Starting the quest to find DMs should start with the store owner. Store owners know their customers, generally, and are the ones that will have the best idea who the most experienced DMs in the area are. This means that you need to still be talking to store owner. Communication should be a mantra by now—live it, love it, repeat it, and do it. This will be the first and easiest way to start tracking down DMs. You will also need to figure out a way then decide on which DMs would be a good fit for the store and separate them from those that aren't. This may sound wrong, and this may go against the inclusion that this hobby promotes, but game stores are a business and part of organizing for them is making sure that program doesn't adversely affect that business. As we all know one of the fastest ways to ruin a game of Dungeons & Dragons is to have a bad DM, and bad DMs can end organized play as well. You need to figure out what to look for in a DM. This means talking with the store owner again—communication. There needs to be a particular set of criteria created for the selection of the DMs. When I am looking for DMs I look for people who love the game, will willingly make time to study and prepare the adventures, are good with people, and more interested in running a fun game than they are playing by exactly what is written. I also make sure the people I am looking at have a reputation for being punctual and responsible. That's really all that I am looking for. And, often that is all you really need to look for.
Determining Dungeon Master Rewards
Once, you have found the DMs the store owner needs to decide if they will receive anything for running. I have heard of some stores offering discounts, some give store credit, and others imply offer a thank-you. I would recommend finding DMs that are happy with a thank you, but the owner may still want to repay them. This primarily needs to be known before play starts so that DMs can be informed before they choose to run or not.
Finding Dungeon Masters
As soon as all of this is cleared up start looking for DMs. Start with the people the store owner knows run games. Once that has started asking about other people they know. Recommendations tend to be a good way to source other people. Once you have done that, or while doing that, set up flyers in the store to get attention, and use the store website/Facebook page/whatever-they-have to spread the word as well. These are all good outlets to spread the word, but the truth is finding DMs is going to take foot work. The organizer and the store owner are going to have to talk to people, possibly lots of them. The amount of time it takes to find the DMs is going to come down to the amount of time and effort put in to find them, and the pool of players the store has to source from.
Code of Conduct
So, now you have set up the organized play, discussed responsibilities, found DMs, and are still communicating yes? Everything is getting closer to being ready to start the games, but what are you supposed to do about troublesome players and DMs? There need to be rules on how to deal with problem players, most stores I have been to have something in place to deal with loud or abusive players and this is even more important when working with organized play. Bad experiences during organized play can wreck the number of participants. I've seen this happen, and it's a downer. You need to have some way to curb troublesome behavior. The store I organize at uses a three-strike system. After three strikes you're out. The store does need to create these guidelines, and they must be known to all the DMs and players before play begins. After that, there are only two things left.
Schedule
Set up a schedule. Mark when games will be played, announce what adventures are being offered, and finally what levels the adventures are. The players need to know all of these things, and they need to know them early, that's right…communication. All of these things must be communicated to the players often. You have to let them know directly after the DMs are told. There is no other option to keep them coming back. Now, there is one problem left. You have to be able to find the players.
Letter from a JRPG Mini-Boss to their young adversaries' guardians
The following correspondence was found among the effects of Chalmond Carmon, Chief Alderman of Windyvale, upon the disposition of their estate. It appears they told no-one of the information contained therein.
Argo Voslant,
Adjutant to Sturmbrigadier Shabbant K'zharn
1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division, MXII Legio, Imperial Army
Kharalian, Palace of the Gate of Doom
Satrapy of Althanda
Dear Alderman Carmon,
It is with great regret that I report the detention and summary execution of four youngsters claiming to be residents of Windyvale, your village. Their names, as far as we can ascertain, were Justinian, Illanda, Shimo and Zasp. Please inform their families and contact us as soon as possible to arrange transit of their remains for interment. In the meantime, we have preserved them in accordance with the Kirian rite. Please accept my most humble apologies if we have erred.
In the usual course of events, this would mark the proper limit of correspondence on behalf of the Imperial Army. However, a marked increase in the number of young, foolish heroes leading assaults on the Opal Throne has been noted, and in this case I find myself particularly moved by the circumstances. My own brother was forced to bring two of these youngsters down themselves in defense of Their Refulgent Majesty's regnant interests, and the days since have not been easy for him. We are accustomed to fending off mighty barbarians, honorable knights and powerful sorcerers, but this is entirely too much.
These were children, Mr. Carmon. Children.
If you are to revolt, would it not be appropriate to do so with your own arms and abilities? I know youngsters can be excitable, but by your inaction, you are allowing your own offspring to waste their lives in futile crusades. And if you are encouraging them -- one of them was convinced a rusted blade, for which they were apparently forced to pay 5g by your own village merchant, was the "ancestral scire of Windyvale's destiny" -- then shame on you. As agents of the Imperial Army, it is our job to crush resistance with an iron fist. This should not entail defending the Empire from its own sons.
As absurd as it is to discuss with apparent rebels the intricacies of combat, I simply cannot contain myself. What on earth are you telling them? Flamboyant, brightly-dyed hairdos confer no advantage whatsoever in a tactical situation, Mr. Carmon. Ten foot-long swords, despite their reach, are in fact deleterious to one's combat performance. Female combatants should be aware that mobility in the face of danger comes secondary to the need for adequate protection -- can you not even appropriately equip them at the outset?
It is not the case that sudden advances in ability and understanding will restore one's health in the midst of battle. One's adversaries will not wait patiently for you to rifle through your possessions in search of useful items. It is not possible to drag around countless miscellaneous objects without impediment. Small animals possessing a high cute coefficient cannot aid you. There is never anything of practical value to be found in ruins, abandoned mines, cave systems and other intriguing locales. Where do they pick up all this nonsense?
No soldier is honored by meaningless slaughter. Ensure that I never have to write to you again.
Sincerely yours,
Argo Voslant,

Ember days (corruption from Lat. Quatuor Tempora, four times) are the days at the beginning of the seasons ordered by the Church as days of fast and abstinence. They were definitely arranged and prescribed for the entire Church by Pope Gregory VII (1073-1085) for the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after 13 December (S. Lucia), after Ash Wednesday, after Whitsunday, and after 14 September (Exaltation of the Cross). The purpose of their introduction, besides the general one intended by all prayer and fasting, was to thank God for the gifts of nature, to teach men to make use of them in moderation, and to assist the needy. The immediate occasion was the practice of the heathens of Rome. The Romans were originally given to agriculture, and their native gods belonged to the same class. At the beginning of the time for seeding and harvesting religious ceremonies were performed to implore the help of their deities: in June for a bountiful harvest, in September for a rich vintage, and in December for the seeding; hence their feriae sementivae, feriae messis, and feri vindimiales. The Church, when converting heathen nations, has always tried to sanctify any practices which could be utilized for a good purpose. At first the Church in Rome had fasts in June, September, and December; the exact days were not fixed but were announced by the priests. The "Liber Pontificalis" ascribes to Pope Callistus (217-222) a law ordering the fast, but probably it is older. Leo the Great (440-461) considers it an Apostolic institution. When the fourth season was added cannot be ascertained, but Gelasius (492-496) speaks of all four. This pope also permitted the conferring of priesthood and deaconship on the Saturdays of ember week--these were formerly given only at Easter. Before Gelasius the ember days were known only in Rome, but after their time their observance spread. They were brought into England by St. Augustine; into Gaul and Germany by the Carlovingians. Spain adopted them with the Roman Liturgy in the eleventh century. They were introduced by St. Charles Borromeo into Milan. The Eastern Church does not know them. The present Roman Missal, in the formulary for the Ember days, retains in part the old practice of lessons from Scripture in addition to the ordinary two: for the Wednesdays three, for the Saturdays six, and seven for the Saturday in December. Some of these lessons contain promises of a bountiful harvest for those that serve God.

The European Union slapped new economic sanctions on Russia on Friday (5 September), but said they could be suspended if Moscow withdraws its troops from Ukraine and observes a ceasefire.
Some provisions will make it harder for Russian state-owned firms to raise finance in the EU. Diplomats expect them to hit, among others, the oil company Rosneft and units of Gazprom, though not the gas firm itself, a main supplier to the EU.
A further 24 people were added to a list of those barred from entry to the bloc and whose assets in the EU are frozen.
“The ambassadors agreed on a package of sanctions against persons and sectors of the Russian economy,” one senior EU diplomat involved in the talks told Reuters.
“The implementation is expected on Monday,” the diplomat said. “A ceasefire must hold for sanctions to be lifted.”
Russia's Foreign Ministry vowed on Saturday to react if the European Union implements new sanctions. “If they [new sanctions] are implemented of course there will be a reaction from our side,” the ministry said in a statement.
Sanctions to be confirmed today
Earlier, diplomats spoke of possibly postponing the sanctions coming into force for up to a week to give President Vladimir Putin time to show they were resolving the conflict. But impatience with Russia's ambiguity in the Ukraine conflict won.
Confirming the deal should take effect on Monday (8 September), the presidents of the European Commission, the EU's executive, and of the European Council, which groups the 28 governments, said in a statement: “It will give the European Union an effective tool, which should allow us to provide a response within a short time span. It will increase the effectiveness of the measures already in place.”
Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Council President Herman Van Rompuy said: “It will also reinforce the principle that EU sanctions are directed at promoting a change of course in Russia's actions in Ukraine.”
Ukrainian government representatives and pro-Russian rebels agreed to declare a ceasefire on Friday at talks in Minsk, the first such breakthrough in the five-month war, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said signing the deal was not in itself enough to halt sanctions.
Merkel: Sanctions ‘can be suspended' if ceasefire holds
Merkel told a news conference at a NATO summit that it would have to be verified whether the ceasefire was being implemented, whether Russian troops were being withdrawn and whether a buffer zone was established. “Everything is in flux,” they said.
“Therefore we should expect that these sanctions could indeed be put into force, but with the provision that they can be suspended again if this process really takes place,” Merkel said.
Britain also backed such a solution.
The European Union and United States imposed sanctions against Russia after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March, and tightened them since then, accusing Russia of supporting pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's east.
The latest wave of sanctions was announced after Western countries said they believed Russia had sent ground troops into Ukraine, helping the rebels with a major advance last week.
More sanctions
EU leaders agreed at a summit on 30 August, in order to prepare the new set of sanctions within the week and diplomats, announcing that the 28 ambassadors should be able to iron out outstanding differences on a text of measures later on Friday.
Governments have been wrangling over details, partly in the hope of limiting the effects of sanctions on their own economies and businesses operating in their own markets. Several smaller EU countries, notably the Czech Republic and Slovakia, dependent on Russian gas, had expressed scepticism about sanctions.
Full and final texts of the measures will not be published until this week. Countries agreed to tighten an export ban on “dual-use goods” – articles that can have both a military and a civilian purpose – to include more than a dozen Russian companies, not only defence firms as had been the case.
Envoys from the EU member states, sitting together in Brussels for the fourth day last week, also agreed to extend curbs on Russian state-owned banks borrowing or raising capital on EU markets so that it applies to all state-owned companies.
They also tightened the conditions on what type of borrowing they could still do, by cutting the maximum maturity of debt they can issue to 30 days from 90.
Gazprom next in the EU's firing line
Sensitive to much of the Western bloc's reliance on Russian natural gas with winter approaching, EU officials have so far ensured that state-owned Gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, was not targeted by sanctions.
But one EU diplomat said after the meeting on Friday that Gazprom's banking unit and its oil arm, Gazprom Neft, could be subject to the new curbs on financing by state-owned companies.
To make it difficult for Russia to finance large projects, such as the current construction of pipelines and major bridges, the EU also imposed a ban on banks taking part in syndicated loans to government-controlled firms, a typical form of funding for such ventures.
And a ban on selling advanced technologies in the energy sector to Russia was extended to include advanced research and know-how for the exploration of difficult deposits like shale gas and deposits in the Arctic.
A proposal to include Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to the list of banned persons was rejected, diplomats said.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — President Donald Trump delivered a rollicking populist and nationalist appeal on Monday, promising to renegotiate trade agreements, clamp down on illegal immigration and keep terrorists out of the country — all in the service of putting “America first.”
In a speech that drew deeply on the core themes of Trump's 2016 campaign, the president promised to pass the Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But they presented it largely as a necessity to finance tax cuts. “We have to get this done to do the other,” Trump declared.
The president made clear that the current health care legislation would have to be changed to make it through Congress. But they appeared unconcerned about the ultimate outcome. “We're going to negotiate; it's going to go back and forth,” Trump said. “In the end, it's going to be great.”

For Trump, who is enduring one of the most difficult stretches of their young presidency, the rally was a chance to bathe in the adulation of a campaign crowd, a sea of people waving placards that said, “Buy American. Hire American” and “Promises Made. Promises Kept.”

They appeared in Louisville after leaving Washington, if only for a few hours, at the end of a tumultuous day that showcased the perils and promise of their presidency. In the House, lawmakers grilled FBI Director James B. Comey and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, about ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump conspicuously avoided any mention of Russia during their speech.
And in the Senate, Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil M. Gorsuch, introduced themselves in what will be several days of confirmation hearings before the Judiciary Committee.
In Kentucky, the president said they would renegotiate trade deals to bring jobs and factories back to the United States. The nation has lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, they said.
This was third speech of Trump's presidency that had an explicitly political theme, drawing on their campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” It had originally been conceived as a rally with supporters in a state where a Republican senator, Rand Paul, has expressed opposition to the Republican health care legislation, which Trump is backing.

I made my first WoW character today. After some careful planning, I decided to join the Alliance. This faction seemed like the more likely haven for terrorists: Night elves: Vaguely oriental, sinister eyebrows.

Gnomes: Love building makeshift weapons and explosives.
Worgen: Shapeshifters who blend in with normal population until the right moment and then transform into savage, murderous beasts.

January 2nd, 2011
The director called me in after the holiday break to give them a progress report. I showed them my level 85 character, pointing out that each piece of their gear was now enchanted and gemmed.
"I specced Survival for better AoE damage," I said.
"Look," the director replied. "I don't care about your virtual Barbie doll. I want to know if you've found any terrorists."
"I'm building up my reputation within some groups," I said. This was technically true. I was halfway to Revered with Therazane. They're the faction that gives the best shoulderpiece enchantments. Probably not what the director meant, though.
"That's all well and good but we need something concrete. I can't justify continuing this operation if we don't have actionable intelligence."
The director was right. It was time to stop beating around the bush. I was going to have to do some raids.
January 4th, 2011
Raids had to be where the terrorists were congregating. It all seemed so obvious now: raids are groups of 10 or 25 people hanging out together in a dungeon for hours. All they talk about is progression and loot. In a word, they're fanatics. If they can care this much about a video game, maybe they can muster up the same enthusiasm for blowing up a bridge.
I found a pick-up group for a raid called Throne of the Four Winds. The final boss is called "Al'Akir." He's basically a tornado with a headscarf. I wondered if we were going to kill this Wind-Muhammad or just worship him.
I tried hard to win over the group's trust from the outset of the raid:
[Raid Leader][Tanksalot]: Anyone has any questions before we pull the boss?
[Raid][Notaspy]: I've got a question: die, infidel scum!
[Raid Leader][Tanksalot]: LOL.
[Raid][Mcmagey]: Typical hunter.
We didn't kill Al'Akir but it wasn't for lack of trying. That chain lightning is a bitch in 25-man. Also, our goddamn shaman kept getting hit by tornados. Stupid keyboard turner.
January 11th, 2011
Two nights later, we finally killed Al'Akir. The director wasn't too pleased with my progress, though. Doesn't they realize how rare the Reins of the Drake of the South Wind are? Al'Akir drops it less than one percent of the time. The print-out of my DPS report on the fight didn't impress either. They used words like "very" and "disappointed," usually adjacent to each other.
"Are you shutting down the project?" I asked.
"Meh," they said. "We spent a billion dollars wiretapping the Butterball turkey hotline. Fifteen bucks a month for WoW seems pretty cheap in comparison. You might as well keep at it."
So, the hunt continues for virtual terrorists. And loot. Mostly loot.

When I first heard The Exorcist was in-development to become a television show, a strange tingling sensation took over my body, from my neck to my L5 vertebrae. This was not a shiver that resembled joy, but more of a dreadful feeling. How dare Fox take on my most beloved horror film of all time, and try to turn it into a television series? I took a deep breath and told myself to go into it with an open mind. I did the same with Damien (The spinoff series of The Omen), and I'm glad I did as I found myself in love with Glen Mazzara's version. Lets just say taking a deep breath didn't quite help. From the moment I pressed play, I started to fall deep into the abyss of disappointment.
We meet Father Tomas (Alfonso Herrera) as they stand in front of their congregation. Delivering their sermon which they believe you should ask questions to God. Right away we, the viewers, see that their faith is not secure. There are some moments that insinuate this may be due to the decisions they have made in their life outside of the Church, but no concrete evidence as of this premiere episode. Further testimony of their loyalty to a higher being is also on display when they take a meeting with Angela Rance (Geena Davis). They tell them that there are voices coming from within the walls, and objects moving in the house. Father Tomas does not believe them and is quite the cynic to this theory. Until they have a vision in their dreams of a profound priest performing an exorcism on a small boy in Mexico.
I was disappointed in this show. One way to change this for the better is by dropping the name and calling it something else. Here are two suggestions:The Demon Within or The Possession perhaps. This series has nothing to do with the original classic film whatsoever. Well, besides the great original theme music. No recurring characters from the film or any of its sequels make any appearance in the show. Unless someone shows up at a later date. The one thing this show does have, is great acting. Everyone does a wonderful job and is believable. Alfonso Herrera is why I will be tuning in again next week to continue this story. One more thing Fox, please drop the scare tactics. Possession and the Devil is freighting enough. We do not need cheap parlor tricks to make us jump. I still hold hope that this will improve but I might just call it by another name.
What are your thoughts on the new show? Leave us your thoughts in the comments below.
“The Exorcist” airs Fridays on Fox.
I've always envied CSI's amazing IP address geolocation capabilities. Not only can they get your exact physical address based solely off your IP (right down to your hotel room number!), it even works on IP addresses that don't exist!
While that level of IP address tracking is beyond the grasp of us mere mortals, MAC address geolocation provided by Google Location Services and Skyhook is pretty close. Just feed them the MAC address of your wireless router and they will tell you, with scary precision, where you are.
But what if you wanted to find the wireless MAC address of someone else's router – remotely? Thanks to an information disclosure vulnerability in DD-WRT, you can.
If you are running DD-WRT and have set the ‘info page' configuration to either ‘enabled' (the default) or ‘disabled', an unauthenticated remote attacker can get your:
Router's LAN/WAN/WLAN MAC addresses
Router's internal IP address
Internal client's IP addresses and host names
All they have to do is make a GET request for the ‘/Info.live.htm' page.
Now, I know what you're thinking: “Surely this only affects DD-WRT routers that have remote administration enabled!” No, it doesn't. And don't call me Shirley.
This is exploitable even with remote administration disabled because DD-WRT is also vulnerable to a public IP DNS rebinding attack. That means that when a user inside your network browses to any Web site, that site can proxy requests through the user's browser and pull this information from the router's internal Web interface – no authentication or remote administration required. And, thanks to Rebind, pulling off this type of rebinding attack is pretty simple.
You can read a more detailed write-up on the vulnerability here, or watch the below video demonstrating the use of Rebind and Google Location Services to obtain the location of a DD-WRT router.
Pool reporters were ditched by Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate Mike Pence this afternoon as the news was breaking about Trump's “hot mic” moment talking about women in vulgar terms. Reporters have been shocked and disgusted as have Republicans, who are coming out to denounce it.
As the story was breaking, Pence was shaking hands at a local restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, where it is customary for famous people to autograph a hot dog bun. Pool reporters followed Pence into the restaurant to take photos and throw out a few questions. According to CNN's Brianna Keilar, the staffer with Pence was leading reporters back to the back where Pence was. The staffer then stopped, had pool reporters stay where they were, and went back to say something to Pence.
“You know what, we're not doing this,” the aide said, returning to reporters.
Reporters asked if they could get photos of Pence leaving the restaurant, where they also might be able to ask questions and they were told no. Pence fled from there.

I love C's structs. There's a lot of weirdness in C but, for the most part, structs are predictable, useful, and easy to understand.
Structs, for those not familiar with C, are collections of data. An example of a struct is a point on a Cartesian plane:
struct point { int x ; int y ; } ; struct point { int x; int y; };
Normally, structs are used to associate two or more pieces of data. As the title suggests, I'm going to demonstrate why you might want to use a struct with a single element.
Preserve Array Type Information
Unlike structs, C's arrays are bothersome, have many surprising corner cases, and are hard for beginners to differentiate from pointers (which are already hard enough to understand on their own). What I find most bothersome about C's arrays is that they cast aside their size information as soon as they are referenced across a function or module boundary.
Let's go through a few examples using C's sizeof operator. First, we'll cover the unsurprising behaviors of arrays. In this example, we allocate the the array and reference it by the name under which it was declared.
void direct_reference ( ) { uint8_t example_array [ 10 ] ; printf ( "%lu
" , sizeof ( example_array ) ) ; } int main ( ) { direct_reference ( ) ; return 0 ; } void direct_reference() { uint8_t example_array[10]; printf("%lu
", sizeof(example_array)); } int main() { direct_reference(); return 0; }
This example, when run, prints the value ‘10' as we'd expect. If we instead replace the function direct_reference with this new function called indirect_reference , we see different behavior.
void indirect_reference ( uint8_t referenced_array [ 10 ] ) { printf ( "%lu
" , sizeof ( referenced_array ) ) ; } void indirect_reference(uint8_t referenced_array[10]) { printf("%lu
", sizeof(referenced_array)); }
int main ( ) { uint8_t example_array [ 10 ] ; indirect_reference ( example_array ) ; return 0 ; } int main() { uint8_t example_array[10]; indirect_reference(example_array); return 0; }
On my 64-bit machine, this example prints the value ‘8', which happens to be the size of a pointer on my system. Note that sizeof treats referenced_array as a pointer even though we've told it explicitly what type referenced_array is.
Fortunately, we can use a single-member struct to preserve this size information across reference boundaries! Here's an example.
struct array_wrapper { uint8_t array [ 10 ] ; } ; struct array_wrapper { uint8_t array[10]; };
void indirect_reference ( struct array_wrapper * a ) { printf ( "%lu
" , sizeof ( a -> array ) ) ; } void indirect_reference(struct array_wrapper * a) { printf("%lu
", sizeof(a->array)); }
int main ( ) { struct array_wrapper ar ; indirect_reference ( & ar ) ; return 0 ; } int main() { struct array_wrapper ar; indirect_reference(&ar); return 0; }
In this example, we define a struct with a single field—the array. Interestingly enough, if we pass around a reference to the struct and perform a sizeof on the array inside of the struct, the array's size is preserved—even across reference boundaries. The struct preserves all the sizing information of its members. Running this code prints the value ‘10', as we'd expect.
This behavior is also consistent when using external references (using ‘extern').
EDIT: User ‘nooneofnote' on reddit.com points out that the same size-preserving effect can be achieved by using typedef instead of a wrapping struct.
Prevent Unwanted Type Coercion
typedef
count_t
int32_t
C provides a mechanism by which we can rename types. Thekeyword gives us a way to make types likethat are reallyunderneath. This is nice for semantics, but it doesn't give any additional compile time safety.
There's nothing to prevent you from, say, defining a type named seconds and another type named milliseconds and then accidentally adding them together! C will happily look behind the typedef in both cases, see that both types are really integers, and add them together! This, of course, likely yields a meaningless result. If you add 5 milliseconds to 10 seconds, you'll either end up with a value of 15 seconds or milliseconds. This is clearly not the desired behavior.
As you may have guessed, we can use another single-member struct to give us that additional compile-time safety that typedef alone doesn't provide! In the following example, we can see the scenario where milliseconds and seconds are being added erroneously.
typedef uint32_t seconds_t ; typedef uint32_t milliseconds_t ; typedef uint32_t seconds_t; typedef uint32_t milliseconds_t;
int main ( ) { seconds_t x = 10 ; milliseconds_t y = 20 ; // oops! seconds_t result = x + y; printf ( "seconds: %u
" , result ) ; } int main() { seconds_t x = 10; milliseconds_t y = 20; // oops! seconds_t result = x + y; printf("seconds: %u
", result); }
We can provide a little more safety here by doing two things. First, instead of using typedef , we can wrap the values in a struct! Secondly, we can define a function that performs the second addition for us. Here's our extended example.
struct seconds { uint32_t val ; } ; struct milliseconds { uint32_t val ; } ; struct seconds add_seconds ( struct seconds a , struct seconds b ) { return ( struct seconds ) { a. val + b. val } ; } struct seconds { uint32_t val; }; struct milliseconds { uint32_t val; }; struct seconds add_seconds(struct seconds a, struct seconds b) { return (struct seconds) { a.val + b.val }; }
int main ( ) { struct seconds x = { 10 } ; struct milliseconds y = { 20 } ; // oops! struct seconds result = add_seconds ( x , y ) ; printf ( "seconds: %u
" , result. val ) ; } int main() { struct seconds x = { 10 }; struct milliseconds y = { 20 }; // oops! struct seconds result = add_seconds(x, y); printf("seconds: %u
", result.val); }
In this example, we pass the integers wrapped in the structures by value to a function responsible for adding them together. As you may be able to tell, this example won't compile! My compiler gives me the following result when I try to build this example:
error : passing 'struct milliseconds' to parameter of incompatible type 'struct seconds' struct seconds result = add_seconds ( x , y ) ; error: passing 'struct milliseconds' to parameter of incompatible type 'struct seconds' struct seconds result = add_seconds(x, y);
What we've done is create a circumstance where the compiler can be more proactive about finding our mistakes. By carrying along the additional struct types, we help reduce the number of mistakes we make when mixing different types that the compiler would normally consider to be interoperable.

Yolanda Renee McNew was speaking to police officers about a call for service when, according to an arrest report, they pulled down their pants. Officers wrote that they bent over and exposed "her bare buttocks" for all to see. The incident happened about 1:29 a.m. May 19 at 7301 Third Ave. N, and "residents were present and within view," according to authorities.
The arrest report did not describe the call for service that McNew, 33, had been speaking to officers about. They face a charge of disorderly conduct.

Man thought sheriff's deputy was their friend and that it would be a 'hoot' to run from them
A Pinellas sheriff's deputy stopped Courtney Eugene Douthit about 10 p.m. on Douglas Avenue because the 37-year-old was peeing in a parking lot, according to an arrest report from May 23. The deputy trained a spotlight on Douthit, according to the report, and asked them to step toward the cruiser.
Douthit took off running, the deputy wrote.
After a short chase, the report states, the deputy caught up to Douthit and asked why they ran.
According to the deputy: Douthit said "he thought I was their friend and it would be a 'hoot' to run."

Transient charged with retail theft stole 74-cent cups of soda from Circle K, arrest report says
Anthony Scott Walters, an 18-year-old transient from Largo, is facing a misdemeanor retail theft charge because they stole several cups of soda from Circle K, according to an arrest report.
On May 21, a police officer wrote in the report, Walters repeatedly entered the store at 1499 Belcher Road and filled up a cup with soda, then left. The store clerk told police Walters did not stop when asked. At one point, the clerk said, Walters threw up their middle finger.
When police asked about the middle finger incident, according to the report, Walters laughed.
The officer wrote that Walters was taken into custody "for depriving the owner (Circle K) of the full retail value of the fountain drink and cup (being $0.74)."

Ivacaftor (trade name Kalydeco) is a drug used to treat cystic fibrosis in people with certain mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (primarily the G551D mutation), who account for 4–5% cases of cystic fibrosis.[1][2] It is also included in a combination drug, lumacaftor/ivacaftor (trade name Orkambi), which is used to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have the F508del mutation in CFTR.
Ivacaftor was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and is the first drug that treats the underlying cause rather than the symptoms of the disease.[3] It was approved by the FDA in January 2012.[4][5] It is one of the most expensive drugs, costing over US$300,000 per year, which has led to criticism of the high cost. The combination drug was approved by the FDA in July 2015.
Cystic fibrosis is caused by any one of several defects in the CFTR protein, which regulates fluid flow within cells and affects the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. One such defect is the G551D mutation, in which the amino acid glycine (G) in position 551 is replaced with aspartic acid (D). G551D is characterized by a dysfunctional CFTR protein on the cell surface. In the case of G551D, the protein is trafficked to the correct area, the epithelial cell surface, but once there the protein cannot transport chloride through the channel. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, improves the transport of chloride through the ion channel by binding to the channels directly to induce a non-conventional mode of gating which in turn increases the probability that the channel is open.[6][7][8]
Medical uses [ edit ]
Ivacaftor is used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in people having one of several specifics mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein: E56K, G178R, S549R, K1060T, G1244E, P67L, E193K, G551D, A1067T, S1251N, R74W, L206W, G551S, G1069R, S1255P, D110E, R347H, D579G, R1070Q, D1270N, D110H, R352Q, S945L, R1070W, G1349D, R117C, A455E, S977F, F1074L, R117H, S549N, F1052V, D1152H.[9][10]
Ivacaftor is also included in a combination product, lumacaftor/ivacaftor, in a single pill, which is used to treat people with cystic fibrosis who have the F508del mutation in CFTR.[11][12][13]
Adverse effects [ edit ]
The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients who received ivacaftor in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies were abdominal pain (15.6% versus 12.5% on placebo), diarrhoea (12.8% versus 9.6% on placebo), dizziness (9.2% versus 1.0% on placebo), rash (12.8% versus 6.7% on placebo), upper respiratory tract reactions (including upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, pharyngeal erythema, oropharyngeal pain, rhinitis, sinus congestion, and nasopharyngitis) (63.3% versus 50.0% on placebo), headache (23.9% versus 16.3% on placebo) and bacteria in sputum (7.3% versus 3.8% on placebo). One patient in the ivacaftor group reported a serious adverse reaction: abdominal pain.[14]
Pharmacology [ edit ]
Pharmacodynamics [ edit ]
Ivacaftor is a "potentiator" of CFTR, meaning it increases the probability that the defective channel will be open and allow chloride ions pass through the channel pore.[11]
Pharmacokinetics [ edit ]
Distribution [ edit ]
Ivacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. Ivacaftor does not bind to human red blood cells.[14]
Biotransformation [ edit ]
Ivacaftor is extensively metabolised in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that ivacaftor is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. M1 and M6 are the two major metabolites of ivacaftor in humans. M1 has approximately one-sixth the potency of ivacaftor and is considered pharmacologically active. M6 has less than one-fiftieth the potency of ivacaftor and is not considered pharmacologically active.[14]
Elimination [ edit ]
Following oral administration, the majority of ivacaftor (87.8%) is eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion. The major metabolites M1 and M6 accounted for approximately 65% of total dose eliminated with 22% as M1 and 43% as M6. There was negligible urinary excretion of ivacaftor as unchanged parent. The apparent terminal half-life was approximately 12 hours following a single dose in the fed state. The apparent clearance (CL/F) of ivacaftor was similar for healthy subjects and patients with CF. The mean (±SD) of CL/F for the 150 mg dose was 17.3 (8.4) L/h in healthy subjects at steady state.[14]
Society and culture [ edit ]
The US Food and Drug Administration approved ivacaftor in January 2012[15] and soon afterwards so too did the European Medicines Agency (EMA)[14] and Canada[16] and across some European countries.
Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was approved by the FDA in July 2015 under breakthrough therapy status and under a priority review.[17]
Economics [ edit ]
The cost of ivacaftor is $311,000 per year, roughly similar to the price of other drugs for extremely rare diseases.[18] In the first 9 months of its second year on the market (2014), ivacaftor sales were $339M, representing 54% of Vertex's product sales revenue. During the same period, drug development expenses were $458M, most of which was spent on cystic fibrosis-related research.[19]
An editorial in JAMA called the price of ivacaftor "exorbitant", citing the support by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in its development and the contribution made by fundamental scientific research performed by the National Institutes of Health and relied upon by Vertex in its cystic fibrosis drug discovery programs.[20] The company responded in an email that "while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."[21]
The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare for people with cystic fibrosis, provided $150 million of the funding for the development for ivacaftor in exchange for royalty rights in the event that the drug was successfully developed and commercialized. In 2014, the Foundation sold these royalty rights for $3.3 billion. The Foundation has stated that it intends to spend these funds in support of further research.[22][23]
Vertex said it would make the drug available free to patients in the United States with no insurance and a household income of under $150,000.[24] In 2012, 24 US doctors and researchers involved in the development of the drug wrote to Vertex to protest the price of the drug, which had been set at about $300,000 per year. In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000 —well above the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence thresholds.[25]
The drug was not covered under the Ontario Drug Benefit plan until June 2014 when the Province of Ontario and the manufacturer negotiated for what "Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews had called a “fair price” for taxpayers". The negotiations took 16 months and it was estimated that around 20 Ontarians required the drug at the time.[26]
The province of Alberta began covering the drug in July 2014, and in September the province of Saskatchewan became the third province to include it in its provincial drug plan.[27]
Delay in agreement on a price for Vertex to charge national health plans led to patient group protests in Wales,[28][29] England,[30] and Australia.[31]
As of March 2016 the combination drug cost $259,000 a year in the United States.[32]
Research [ edit ]
The clinical trials used in the regulatory approval of ivacaftor are described here.
G551D mutation [ edit ]
Of the approximately 70,000 cases of cystic fibrosis worldwide, 4% (~3,000) are due to a mutation called G551D.[33][34] The safety and efficacy of ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients with this mutation was examined in 2 clinical trials.
The first trial was performed in adults having baseline respiratory function (FEV1) between 32% and 98% of normal for persons of similar age, height, and weight. The baseline average was 64%. Improvement in FEV1 was rapid and sustained. At the end of 48 weeks, people treated with ivacaftor had on average an absolute increase in FEV1 of 10.4%, vs. a decline of 0.2% in the placebo group. Pulmonary exacerbations were reduced by about half in the ivacaftor group relative to the placebo group.[35]
In a second trial conducted in children age 6 to 11, the average improvement in FEV1 was an absolute increase of 12.5% in the ivacaftor group at 48 weeks, compared to a very slight decline in the placebo group.[36]
Other mutations [ edit ]
A third clinical trial examined the efficacy of ivacaftor in people with cystic fibrosis due to G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R mutations. This trial, which included 39 people of age greater than 6 years, used a crossover design. The people in the trial had FEV1 averaging 78% of normal at baseline. The people in the trial were randomized to receive either ivacaftor or placebo for 8 weeks. This was followed by a 4 to 8 week washout period, then each group received the opposite treatment from what it received in the first part of the trial. At week 8, the people on treatment with ivacaftor experienced an average absolute improvement in FEV1 of 13.8%, but there was a strong dependence of the efficacy on the exact mutation that a patient had. The detailed data for different mutation types is shown in the U.S package insert.[37]

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Alejandro Rodriguez wants to be a sommelier. Their previous experience: 20 years as an oil reservoir engineer.

The 42-year-old needed to consider a career plan B after ARC Resources Ltd laid them off in January, adding to a growing number of people in the Canadian city of Calgary, Alberta who no longer have a place in its once-vibrant oil and gas industry.
Once lured by high pay and a multitude of opportunities, many job seekers in Calgary often have one mission these days: get out of the industry and never return.
“I see this as an opportunity to go for the passions you may have. If the downturn had not come, I would be continuing in the oil and gas industry,” said Rodriguez.
While the oil-rich province has a long boom and bust history, executive recruiters say pessimism is deeper than in the past, with a growing number of white-collar workers looking for more stable careers.
In May, there were 25,000 fewer jobs in Calgary than there were a year earlier. Unemployment hit 8.1 percent, according to Statistics Canada data, higher than the 7.8 percent unemployment seen across Alberta, which has nearly doubled from 4.6 percent two years earlier.
Those departures suggest the industry could forever lose some of the talent and expertise it would need during a recovery.
“We have people coming through our programs saying ‘We are done. We do not want oil and gas jobs any more because it's too unstable',” said Jackie Rafter, founder of Higher Landings, a company that tries to help people move into different careers.
With U.S. crude around $48 a barrel, less than half the price it was two years ago, industry veterans call this slump the worst in a generation. Last month's wildfire in the northern Alberta oil sands region landed a cruel extra blow.
The Canadian industry's shift to produce higher cost oil sands crude also makes a recovery less likely in a low-price environment. Research firm Wood Mackenzie recently estimated new thermal oil sands projects would need a U.S. crude price of around $60 to break even over time.
“DO I WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?”
That means there is plenty of demand for Rafter's company, which held a recent workshop in a small, windowless conference room on the 52nd floor of Calgary's Suncor Energy tower.
During the hour-long bring-your-own-lunch session, attendees are urged to focus on their values, beliefs and identity, as well as skills. They urge attendees to “unpeel the onion,” to figure out what kind of career would work for them.
But they warn those that think they can land another oil and gas job they are in for a shock since jobs that were once plentiful are now hard to come by.
“I feel sorry for those people who expect to get another job doing what they were doing before,” they said.
Wayne Beatty, 61, former vice president of corporate development at oil sands producer Southern Pacific Resource Corp, which went bust last year, is working toward provincial insurance and mutual fund licenses for a new career in financial services.
“The swings (in oil and gas) are much bigger than what other industries have seen and that creates all sorts of havoc,” they said.
Rafter said other Higher Landing clients include an engineer who has joined an accounting firm, a former oil company accountant turned nutritionist, and an oilfield services human resources manager who now works for a construction firm.
Bruce Proctor, managing partner of executive recruiter Summit Search Group in Calgary, said oil and gas professionals who have been laid off for six months or longer often then take a hard look at their options.
They ask, “‘do I want to go through this again once the industry comes back in another three to five years?'” they said.
CASUALTIES
There is another problem for Calgary's job seekers. Some prospective employers worry oil veterans might return to their old, lucrative jobs if prices recover.
Summit Search Group's Proctor said many of their clients worry that former energy sector workers use other jobs — which often have lower status and pay — as stopgaps for tough times, so they won't consider oil and gas “casualties” for jobs now.
David Elsey, vice president at recruiter Executrade, said many companies have been burned in the past by hiring oil and gas workers, only to see them jump ship as soon as a new posting in the sector came available.
“It's a nightmare from a recruitment perspective, you have such skilled people and can't do anything with them,” they said.
Marian Hanna, who said they are in their 50s, lost their job as president of ION Geophysical Canada last July when the geoscience firm closed its Calgary office.
They recently completed a corporate directors designation program, similar to an executive MBA, run out of the city's Haskayne School of Business, and is the current president of the Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists.
While the title is impressive, it does their little good these days because good job opportunities are so scarce, they said.
“If push comes to shove... I may be in retail or a Walmart greeter. I am not trying to be negative, but that's the reality,” they said. “With 100,000 people out of work you can imagine how many apply when there's an opportunity.”

When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts they kept their distance from gambling. They turned down donations from the gaming industry for their privately underwritten inaugural gala. And though they initially supported allowing the establishment of slot parlors in order to close a $3 billion state deficit, they later announced they would not consider an expansion of gambling and decried the “social costs associated with gaming.” On the presidential campaign trail this year, Romney similarly declared that they opposed online poker because “of the social costs and people's addictive gambling habits.” They explained, “I don't want to increase access to gaming. I feel that we have plenty of access to gaming right now through the various casinos and establishments that exist.”
As a onetime bishop of the Mormon church—which opposes gambling, including state-sponsored lotteries—Romney's lack of enthusiasm about legalized gambling is hardly surprising. Yet such reservations did not hinder them when they were a mega-financier. While Romney ran Bain Capital, the private equity firm they founded, they owned a Bain-affiliated investment fund that bet heavy on betting.
In March 1999, shortly after Romney departed Bain to run the 2002 Winter Olympics, Brookside Capital Investors Inc., a Bain-related entity wholly owned by Romney, filed a document with the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing the investments held the past quarter in its $559 million portfolio. On this roster were 1.2 million shares of GTECH Holdings Corp., then valued at $29 million. The company billed itself in its 1999 annual report as “a leading global supplier of systems and services to the lottery and gaming/entertaining industries.” This description put it mildly; Gtech was the world's largest supplier of computer equipment for lotteries. It operated about 30 of 37 state lotteries in the United States, along with lotteries in England, Israel, Turkey, Australia, and other countries. It also was teaming up with big gaming firms to buy or revamp casinos and race tracks, adding and upgrading gambling equipment at these venues.
In 1998, Gtech had pulled in nearly $1 billion in revenue from its various gaming ventures. At the time Romney was investing in the firm, it was seeking to become a pioneer in Internet gambling.
The SEC filing reporting the Gtech investment doesn't state when Romney's Brookside Capital fund first purchased shares in the firm, but in the mid- and late-1990s the gaming company had a controversial reputation. In 1998, Guy Snowden resigned as head of the company a day after losing a bitter libel battle against billionaire Richard Branson, who had accused Snowden of trying to bribe them into withdrawing from a competition to run England's national lottery. Reporting on Snowden's departure, Fortune noted that “Snowden's often sleazy, win-at-all-costs tactics…have helped make Gtech the dominant force in the computerized lottery business.” Snowden's exit followed a run of Gtech scandals. In 1996, a top executive of the Providence, Rhode Island-based firm was convicted in New Jersey of fraud, bribery, money laundering, and conspiracy. (The exec had hired lobbyists to push for expanding the New Jersey lottery and had received kickbacks.) In Texas, where Gtech paid a well-connected lobbyist $3.2 million, there were also allegations of kickbacks and shady wheeling-and-dealing.
After Snowden lost their case against Branson, Gtech stock hit a low, and it might well have looked like a bargain to investors bullish on the long-term prospects of gambling, particularly online lotteries and Internet-based gaming.
Neither the Romney campaign nor Gtech responded to a request for comment.
These days, Romney takes a dark view of gambling. “Gaming has a social effect on a lot of people,” they told Las Vegas journalist Jon Ralston earlier this year. It could be that Romney's view has been shaped by Mormon doctrine. After Romney offered to bet Texas Governor Rick Perry $10,000 during a debate last December to settle a dispute—and there's no telling how serious Romney was—bloggers and reporters noted that gambling violated the precepts of the Mormon Church, which contends, “Gambling is motivated by a desire to get something for nothing. This desire is spiritually destructive.” But politics, too, might influence Romney's position on gambling. From the mid-2000s on, as a potential or declared presidential candidate, Romney had an interest in courting conservative Christian voters who tend to oppose gambling.
Yet it's complicated. During the 2012 campaign, even as Romney has declared their opposition to expanding online gambling, they have welcomed the hearty support of well-heeled casino magnates Donald Trump and Sheldon Adelson. And at Bain, they apparently are not opposed to investing millions of dollars in a prominent gambling multinational, despite its spotty reputation. If they had any concern about “the social effect,” it apparently was trumped by the profit motive.
While the dust settles and Christchurch recovers from the 7.1 earthquake, people have begun to pick up the pieces and get on with their lives. But for many working class people this is not so easy. Those most affected by ‘natural disasters' — whether by the tsunami in the Pacific, earthquakes in Haiti, Chile and now Christchurch, NZ — are those already on the margins of despair.
As the impact of the quake became known we saw the authorities rush to ‘lock down' the CBD, and after a short time brought in the military in a quasi ‘martial law' scenario. With the aid of the corporate media and using the odd collapsed and damaged building as a backdrop, a sensational picture was painted of a city in ruins. Their reports were far from helpful — heavily recycling dramatic images while providing little concrete advice and information for those of us on the ground. It was hard to not get the feeling that it was little more than a ratings seeking adventure at our expense.
Out in the worst affected suburbs people waited for days to receive help from the authorities. While the state hurried to safeguard inner city property, people in the outer limits were left to fend for themselves. Many acts of mutual aid were carried out, with friends and neighbours ‘mucking in' — firstly to make sure everyone was safe and then supporting each other with what they could to survive. Some shopkeepers offered free milk, people offered water from private wells, and with the University closed students organised themselves into solidarity teams (numbering over 1000 in total) and went about helping those in an inspiring display of mutual aid.
However reports are coming to light of a number of abusive and oppressive scenarios. Workers have been forced to work in unsafe conditions or told to stay home without being paid. First Security, Subway and the Readings Cinema have all put profits before people in a blatant disregard of the interests of their staff. Equally concerning is the example of a Welfare Centre that in a blatant act of racism evicted a large Maori whanau who were seeking comfort, support and refuge in a facility set up for this purpose ('freeloaders' was the term used).
Many people have lost everything and many stories are now being told of residents of rental properties having to stay in dangerous and substandard housing with nowhere to go, as greedy landlords refuse to subsidise rent, make repairs or break fixed-term lease agreements. There was also one case where the City Council evicted residents from council flats without any notice and are refusing to allow occupants to access their belongings, leaving them homeless, penniless and with only the clothes on their backs. All this is ongoing, as are the aftershocks.
Women have once again copped the worst of it. Cases of domestic violence have skyrocketed while earthquake tremours continue, adding to the already heavy trauma associated with the quake, aftershocks and school closures.
We should not be so hasty to lump praise on the State just because it showed a helping hand in a time of need, a hand in the service of the biggest disaster of all — capitalism. Nor should we ignore the draconian measures the state has recently passed. The Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Bill gives a single Minister (Brownlee) the power to repeal or modify practically any law on our statute book, without even having to refer to Cabinet, let alone Parliament. This Act was voted in by all Parties in the House, which shows more than ever the true motives of our supposedly neutral state: increased power for the few, a privileging of property and an emphasis on order (ie business as usual).
While Civil Defence volunteers and Emergency Services did a good job with the organisational structures they had to work with, questions should be asked as to whether a more co-ordinated but decentralised approach could have brought more relief to those out in the suburbs. One alternative could be a model of community resource facilities run the people themselves, acting as a hub — not only for disaster relief and mutual aid — but as a genuine decision making space that truly enables people in their neighbourhoods to organise collectively to best meet their needs. There are plenty of examples worldwide of such resources being directly controlled and self-managed by those involved via regular assemblies, and these models could equally apply to such national networks such as Civil Defence.
As time goes by many more stories will be told, and we hope they will add to the positive examples already around us. The most spectacular thing that always comes out of these situations — more than damaged buildings or 'live on the scene' reports — is the ability of people to help one another. Solidarity and mutual aid has largely formed the foundation of people's distrupted lives over the last week or so, and shows us that these principles are in fact evident in human nature, however suppressed they currently are by the competition and consumption of our modern environment (an environment in which the State plays a major role).
For those of us in Christchurch who have lived through this experience, who huddled in doorways, shoveled silt, and witnessed first hand the real beneficiary of the state's response (inner city property), life goes on. For most, it will never be the same again.
Gay adoption applications are on the rise in Britain, while applications from heterosexual couples are falling, according to a report.
“Last year, one in seven adoption orders was made by a gay couple,” reported the Independent on Thursday. “Wilsons, a private law firm that analysed the figures, noted that the number of gay couples applying for adoption increased from 510 in 2013-2014 to 586 last year.”
Meanwhile, the Independent noted that the number of applications from heterosexual couples “has fallen from 4,914 to 3,561.”
“The door has really opened now for all kinds of individuals to start their own family. Same-sex adoptions are at a record high, and it may be that the legalisation of gay marriage in 2013 has been a catalyst for more same-sex couples to adopt,” declared Wilsons associate lawyer Sarah Wood-Heath, who added that medical breakthroughs could be the reason for a decline in adoption applications from heterosexuals.
“Medical advances have meant that alternative birthing options such as surrogacy or IVF are increasingly attractive for many heterosexual couples – there are now so many options for anyone to have a child,” they explained.
Gay couples have been able to adopt in Britain since 2002, while, “Both partners have rights to joint legal parenting since 2005.”

A home on Elmhurst was developed by the Cass Community Social Services is the first of 25 tiny homes to be sold in Detroit (Photo: Matt Helms/Detroit Free Press)
DETROIT — They may not be mansions or sprawling estates, but they will be "home" nonetheless for dozens of Detroit residents who otherwise may not become homeowners.
The first of 25 new tiny homes made its public debut Thursday in a neighborhood on Detroit's west side, part of a project that aims to transform two blocks into a community for people previously shut out of homeownership.
Cass Community Social Services is spearheading the $1.5-million project to build the small homes over the next couple of years. The Rev. Faith Fowler, the group's executive director, said the houses will be between 250 and 400 square feet and will be reserved for low-income owners.
The first house is a beige Tudor-style home with a combined kitchen, living room and dining nook looking out the front windows. To the left of the kitchen is an open closet-sized bedroom, and to the right is a comparatively spacious bathroom with a toilet, sink and shower.
From the outside, the house, with a steep brown roof and a decorative stone chimney, looks bigger than it is, but it's certainly a tiny house — 300 square feet.
Fowler said the homes are designed to give low-income single people, or “couples who really love each other,” the option to buy their own home while rebuilding community in a neighborhood marked by blight and vacant lots.
“This is a program about aspirations,” Fowler said during a news conference. “This isn't just a housing program. This program is ready for people who are ready” to be homeowners.
Applicants will be required to show that they are low income under federal guidelines and will be subject to checks of criminal history, rental history, work history and an interview. The homes will be targeted to formerly homeless men and women, seniors, college students, and Cass Community staff members.
Fowler said the program will use a rent-to-own model, with tenants graduating from a lease to a land contract and full ownership after seven years. Most buyers will spend no more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent and utilities. A 250-square-foot home would cost $250 monthly, a 300-square-foot home, $300 a month, and so on up to $400 for the largest homes.

Fowler said applications will be available beginning Oct. 1 and will be due by the end of the month for the first seven houses, which they said they expect to have built and occupied by October or November. Construction on the second phase is set for spring 2017.
Fowler said building a neighborhood of tiny homes has been a learning experience for their organization and for the city. They said Mayor Mike Duggan's administration has been supportive of the project, and Tom Lewand, the city's group executive for jobs and economic growth, also spoke at the news conference.
Cass Community is raising money for the project and so far has brought in $700,000 of its $1.5-million goal. One of the major supporters is the Ford Motor Co. Fund, which donated $400,000.
The Ford Fund's president, Jim Vella, called the project a “game changer” — not only for people who will move into the homes, but also for the neighborhood and perhaps others elsewhere.
“What it does is provide affordable housing for people who can't afford something else on their own,” Vella said. “So as the city looks at what it has to do to make neighborhoods viable again, this isn't the option for every neighborhood, but it could work.”

PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Federal officials in Oregon have been trucking hatchery salmon more than a hundred miles (160 km) north to another hatchery in Washington state throughout July to preserve fish that had been dying off by the thousands in an unseasonably warm river.
Water that would rarely top 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) at this time of year in the Warm Springs River has reached 76 (24.4 Celsius), hot enough to weaken juvenile spring salmon immune systems, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fisheries supervisor Rich Johnson told Reuters on Wednesday.
About 2,000 of the fish were dying every day before they were relocated, they said.
“If the weather continues warm, there could be more problems for fish,” Johnson said, noting that river temperatures across the region spiked a full month earlier than usual this year.
The effort to save Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery's 160,000 remaining baby fish – plus 680 adults - comes as state wildlife officials in both Oregon and Washington have imposed rare fishing restrictions.
High temperatures have been blamed for hundreds of thousands of wild and hatchery fish deaths throughout the U.S. Pacific Northwest.
At central Oregon's Rock Creek Hatchery, a mechanical error that halted water flow was made worse by high water temperatures in June, killing 400,000 pre-smolt spring Chinook salmon.
Washington and Oregon state wildlife officials have reported hundreds of wild fish found dead along riverbanks in both states over the past month as well.
The salmon at Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery were particularly vulnerable because of their location east of the Cascade Mountains, Johnson said.
Despite its name, there are no warm springs nearby, but low snowpack on nearby Mount Hood has left the hatchery with little of the chilling runoff that would normally cool its waters, they said.
After rejecting a proposal to chill the water at Warm Springs as too expensive, officials opted instead to transport the fish to Little White Salmon National Fish Hatchery in Washington, located on the much cooler Columbia River, Johnson said.
“We will hold these little fish at little White Salmon until around October, when the temperatures cool, then we will move them back to Warm Springs to let them finish maturing there,” they said. Once the salmon mature enough, they are tagged and released into the wild.

The proposed drone replacement for the U-2 spy plane is still years away from being as effective and only then with key sensors and cameras cannibalized from the U-2, top Air Force officials said Wednesday.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Monday the Pentagon and Air Force plan to start retiring the U-2 fleet in 2015 and hand the reconnaissance mission off to the RQ-4 Global Hawk drone.
When asked why the Air Force couldn't get new cameras for the Global Hawk Block 30 drones, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Larry Spencer said “it would be cost prohibitive.”
Spencer did not give cost estimates but said the solution was to “unbolt the sensor on the U-2 and bolt it onto the Block 30.”
Spencer and Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James both said the U-2 was better at high-altitude reconnaissance missions than the Global Hawk. In Spencer's estimation, the U-2 Dragon Lady was “far superior.”
On the Global Hawks, “the sensors at the moment are not quite as good so we'll be working on that,” James said. “That will take a few years,” Spencer said.
James and Spencer also said the Global Hawks needed improvements in their ability to cope with bad weather to match the all-weather capabilities of the U-2s.
The proposal to retire the U-2s in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget plan unveiled by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Monday was already expected to get major pushback from Congress, and the need for upgrades to the Global Hawks outlined by James and Spencer could possibly add up to a new lease on life for the U-2s.
The Air Force does not dispute the legendary track record of the U-2s, which first started flying in 1955. U-2s went on countless spy missions over the Soviet Union, China and North Vietnam, and in 1962 it was a U-2 that first produced evidence that the Soviets were preparing sites to install nuclear missiles in Cuba.
More recently, U-2s have spotted soil disturbances in Afghanistan suggesting the presence of roadside bombs. In Syria, U-2s tracked the chemical weapons activities of the Damascus regime.
The Air Force tried to kill the U-2s two years ago, but decided that sticking with the U-2s over the Global Hawks was cheaper.
“Two years ago, the U-2 was the least costly,” Spencer said, “but now the Global Hawk is the least expensive of those two systems” after the program was reworked by Northrop Grumman.
The proposals to retire the U-2s and the A-10 Thunderbolt ground attack aircraft were two of the most controversial initiatives in the Air Force' submission to the overall budget plan.
James said that the A-10, better known as the “Warthog,” was a “great plane,” but ground troops were dependent “on whatever plane can get there first” in a crisis. They said that more than 80 percent of the close air support missions in Afghanistan were not flown by A-10s but by AC-130 gunships and by F-15E Strike Eagle fighters, B-1 bombers and B-52 bombers using satellite-guided munitions.
“We love the airplane but we simply can't afford it,” James said of the A-10. James and Spencer spoke at an all-day forum on defense issues sponsored by Bloomberg Government.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — A familiar face, and a very popular one, returns to Oakland for the next three days.
Outfielder Yoenis Céspedes will make their first appearance against the A's since being traded to Boston in July, coming in with Oakland's old nemesis, the Tigers.
“It would be nice to see them take a few days off, if they want to take a few days off,” A's manager Bob Melvin joked, then added, “I've managed a few guys I'm close to, and certainly he's one of them. You appreciate seeing them as a person ... maybe not as much as a player.
“My guess is he'll get a nice reaction from the fan base for what they did with the team.”
In the 2½ seasons Céspedes played for Oakland, the team was 228-131 with them in the lineup. Since they were dealt for Jon Lester and Jonny Gomes on July 31, the A's are 38-63.
“I think Cespy will get a nice ovation from the fans, and they should,” said reliever Dan Otero, who has remained in touch with Céspedes — their Cuban family members are friends. “He had 2½ pretty good years for us, did a lot of really good things. I think we might see some La Potencia banners out there.”
Céspedes leads the league with 16 doubles and is batting .289 with five homers, 24 RBIs and 23 runs.
Injury news: Left-hander Eric O'Flaherty (shoulder) will throw a bullpen session on Monday and could head out on a rehab assignment later in the week, and right-hander A.J. Griffin (Tommy John surgery) also will throw a bullpen session on Monday but their rehab assignment has not yet been determined.
Ben Zobrist (knee) played second base for Triple-A Nashville on Sunday and went 1-for-4 with a run scored, and closer Sean Doolittle (shoulder) pitched one inning, allowing two hits and a run.
Zobrist will come off the disabled list Monday. Little-used outfielder Craig Gentry is likely to come off the roster to make room for him.

Last week at E3, we were invited by LA VR studio Survios to check out their progress on Raw Data, their co-op action combat game for the HTC Vive. They've made a lot of progress since the Robotics Lab they first showed at VRLA. That was a tech demo allowing players to get used to different weapons and enemies by co-defending a single room from a stationary point in the middle.
Welcome to Skyport
This time around, Survios has an entire level built out called Skyport. You're still defending a nexus with another player, but there are many additional features. For one, the board is much bigger, with multiple lanes between your nexus and enemy territory. Here's our play-through if you want to see longer-form gameplay.
Instead of being confined to the center, they built in teleportation, allowing you to cover the entire map. You also have the ability to build turrets to protect your base while you're busy teleporting about.
New Characters
Unlike the tech demo, where you could use every weapon, Survios is building out distinct hero classes. The first two are the Gun Cleric and the Cyber Ninja. Each has its own unique weapons and abilities.
As the Gun Cleric, you're a slinger dual-wielding a pair of pistols. Your powers include a charged shot, overcharged rapid fire, and bullet time.
As the ninja, you get a set of laser katanas you can swing or throw like boomerangs, a mid-range electric pulse, telekinetic throwing powers and this power-bomb jump slam thing.
There are a bunch of new bad guys too. Killer robots including ninja stealthers, laser gunners, heavy rocket mechs, drones, and these crawling guys with no legs.
Wanna play? Keep your eye out for an early access release on Steam on July 14. Survios is planning on launching the final game in late 2016.
About Survios
Founded in 2013, Survios is a Los Angeles-based virtual reality studio focused on building connected VR experiences with emergent interactivity, social multiplayer, and visceral play.
The U.S. achieved a minor milestone today with the number of private sector payroll jobs finally exceeding the pre-recession peak. This raises a few of key points:
1) This doesn't include growth of the labor force and population.
2) Total employment is still below the pre-recession peak because of all the public sector layoffs (see previous post for a table of annual public sector job losses). Total employment should be above the pre-recession peak this summer.
3) Even though it took 6+ years to exceed the previous employment peak, this is actually better than most recoveries from a financial crisis. (Note: this recovery was during a period of declining participation - partially due to demographics - and that makes this milestone even better).
From Josh Lehner today: Getting There. Financial Crises Edition.
[T]he graph compares employment loss for Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff's so-called Big 5 financial crises with the U.S. Great Depression and Great Recession. Using Reinhart and Rogoff's great work on historical financial crises, our office previously looked into comparing the Great Recession with these historical financial crises to see how the current cycle stacked up. Overall the Great Recession was your “garden-variety, severe financial crisis” as Rogoff once said, but in terms of employment, the U.S. has actually done fairly well when compared with these other, major crises. Not good enough overall to avoid mass unemployment and lackluster growth, but in the context of historical financial crises, the U.S. employment picture is better than most.
[A]lmost all of the additional purchases under the program were pulled forward from the very near future; the effect of the program on auto purchases is almost completely reversed by as early as March 2010 – only seven months after the program ended. The effect of the program on auto purchases was significantly more short-lived than previously suggested. We also find no evidence of an effect on employment, house prices, or household default rates in cities with higher exposure to the program.
In 2009, many of us argued the current recovery would be sluggish because of the causes of the recession (a housing bust that led to a financial crisis). This is why I never understood why projects needed to be "shovel ready" to be included in the early 2009 stimulus package. Look at the construction job losses in the previous post , clearly infrastructure investment could have been spread out over several more years.Unfortunately, when the stimulus was being introduced, many opponents argued the economy would recover quickly without the stimulus (obviously poor economic analysis). Even the Obama administration mostly thought the recovery would happen sooner (hence the unfortunate pivot to austerity).Even today some policymakers don't understand what happened. As an example, from U.S. Congressman Kevin Brady (R-TX), chairperson of the Joint Economic Committee: “That it took six long years for America's economy to simply return to break even for Main Street jobs is compelling proof of President Obama's disappointing economic leadership." Unfortunately that shows the "chairperson of the Joint Economic Committee" is ignorant of the nature of recoveries from a financial crisis. Very sad.. What did we do correctly? And what did we do wrong?Wrong is easy - some of the stimulus was a clear mistake. As an example, the tax credit for business investment - when there was already too much supply - was a mistake. And research by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi suggests that "cash for clunkers" wasn't effective:And of course I vigorously opposed the expensive and ineffective housing tax credit that was originally proposed by Senators Johnny Isakson (R) and Joe Lieberman (I). I opposed the tax early and often . The tax credit for buying new homes was especially dumb. A key problem during the housing bust was the excess supply of vacant housing units, and incentivizing people to buy new homes (and add to the supply) made no sense at all.But clearly most of the stimulus was effective , and I think more infrastructure investment (help with construction employment) - and more aid to states (keep more teachers, police and firefighters employed) - would have been very helpful.Luckily the track record of the Federal Reserve was better than for fiscal policymakers. Although Bernanke was slow to recognize what was happening - and they underestimated the severity of the crisis (remember " contained to subprime "?) - when they finally understood what was happening, the Fed was very effective. Bernanke's critics argued that their policies would lead to inflation ( wrong ) and a collapse in the dollar against other currencies ( also wrong ).The key points are this recovery is better than most from a financial crisis and policymakers did many of the correct things (although they could have done better).
Why does PFLAG (originally: Parents and Families of Lesbians and Gay people) now promote so many trans activists? They don't even stay true to their acronym anymore; their home page says they are “Parents, Families, Friends and Allies United with LGBTQ People.”
It's not that young people who identify as transgender deserve to be discriminated against. It's not that they don't deserve support. Why don't parent, friends, and allies of transgender-identified youth form their own support and lobbying organizations? (Oh, wait, they have: Organizations like TransActive and Trans Youth and Family Allies are springing up like mushrooms.)
Especially since several decades of replicated research shows that most (75-96%, depending on study) gender nonconforming children, if left alone, grow up to be happy gay, lesbian, or bisexual adults. The current trend of identifying children as young as 18 months as transgender–which includes treating them as the opposite sex–amounts to proactive anti-gay conversion therapy. Effeminate little boys and tomboyish little girls are being herded onto the transition train with puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. They don't even get a fighting chance to discover whether they might someday be non-transitioned gay people. All a rough-and-tumble little girl has to say is, “I'm a boy, mommy!” (as little tomboys who grow up to be lesbian or bisexual have said since forever), and it's off to the “gender therapist” and the endocrinologist.
Trans activists are very fond of saying that gender identity has nothing to do with sexual preference. If that is the case, why did anyone ever think to tack the “T” onto LGB? Such skillful hijacking while the rest of us were sleeping.
PFLAG families, can't you see this? If your aim is to neatly slot your child into a gender box, by all means, form organizations to promote and support your offspring.
But proud parents of lesbian and gay people? PFLAG was formed to support your gay and lesbian kids–not co-opt and even undermine their best interests.
Can we really live a “stress-free” life of ease and tranquility, even in the midst of such busyness? Or is it just a pipe dream? An ideal outside the range of possibility?
It can sometimes feel like this.
Because we tend to stress about many things — from what to wear to what the neighbors think of us — and have done so for most of our lives, it's hard to imagine anything different.
But when we question this “stressed-out” norm, and look at the thoughts that create the tension we experience in the mind and then the body, we can see where it all begins.
Tracing the stress back to the source – a thread of negative thinking – we can uproot the weeds that overrun the peaceful garden of the mind.
This is the power of meditation: Realizing that at the fundamental level, the mind is peaceful, clear, still.
Beneath the raging thoughts that propel us ever forward, there is a quietude awaiting our discovery.
As we practice dwelling in this stillness, we can see, with ever increasing accuracy, where and when the thoughts start.
Perhaps your spouse says something in the morning that triggers you. Something about the upcoming bills (even though you have it under control!), and this sets your thoughts into a flurry.
Instead of these thoughts spiraling out of control and casting a shadow over this sunny morning, the habitual reaction can be interrupted.
We can see our tendency of allowing one single comment to tip-off the long-running story of how we're unappreciated, and how nothing we do is good enough, and how we need to control our spending…
Resting in a state of awareness brings detachment. Detaching from the story stops the stress.
And maybe there's a conversation to have around the finances. Not a problem. It's just another part of the day.
When we see each experience as simply the next step in our journey, there is a lightness and ease about it.
So, take a breath, take the next step, and let yourself be stress-free.
Quick Meditation Tip
With each breath, we renew our attention to the moment. A thought arises, the breath is there. Again and again. Slowly the muddiness of the scattered mind settles into clarity. And there is never any forcing necessary. We are continually allowing, releasing, letting go. Relaxation is the only action.
Mindful Homework
See if you can give your full and undivided attention to something that you've never given your attention to in this way. Have you ever just sat in your car on the drive to work and not attempted to distract yourself from it? Try it this week. Just focus on your breath, on the vibrant scenery laid out in front of you — how relaxed can you allow yourself to be while taking everything. And this can be applied to anything you might find dull or “everyday.” Just tune in. See what you find in the ordinary.
Quote From Adam
“Life unfolds as it pleases. Therefore, surrender is the most creative, assertive, and intelligent response we can make to any moment.”

Matrix of Deceit: Forcing Pre-election and Exit Polls to Match Fraudulent Vote Counts
Proving Election Fraud: Phantom Voters, Uncounted Votes and the National Poll

Democratic Primaries spread sheet
From TDMS Research: Democratic 2016 primaries
In the Aug. 24 Ipsos/Reuters poll Clinton had 39%; Trump 36%; Johnson 7%; Stein 3%. The sample of 1,516 Americans included 635 Democrats (41.9%), 527 Republicans (34.8%), 174 Independents (11.5%) and 180 (11.8%) who did not indicate a preference. http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=7349
The latest Gallup Party-ID survey indicates 28% Democrats, 28% Republicans and 42% Independents.
http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx
In the July 17 Ipsos poll, Independents comprised just 14% of the sample. Stein had 1%. Clinton and Trump were tied. https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/strange-polls-jill-stein-at-1-and-just-14-of-respondents-are-independents/
Why the large discrepancies between the Ipsos poll and Gallup Party-ID survey?
The Ipsos poll also indicated a Party_ID split of 36% Democrats and 25% Republicans – an apparent contradiction to the polling sample. Assuming the other 39% were Independents, it is a close match to the Gallup Survey.
In the primaries, Sanders won approximately 65% of Independents and 35% of Democrats. One would logically expect that Stein would do nearly as well as Sanders against Clinton in a four-way race. They are in essential agreement on major issues – and Clinton has very low approval ratings. But Stein had an implausibly low 3% on Aug. 24 and 1% on July 17.
True Vote Model Model Base Case
This is not a forecast. It is a scenario analysis based on the following assumptions.
Party-ID: 39% Independents, 36% Democrats, 25% Republicans.
Vote shares: Stein has 40% of Independents and 35% of Democrats. Clinton has 25% and 50%, respectively. They each have 5% of Republicans.
Base Case Result
Stein 29.45% and 231 EV, Clinton 29.00% and 196 EV, Trump 25.15% and 111 EV.

‘The Haymaker' is Leafly Deputy Editor Bruce Barcott's weekly column on cannabis politics and culture.
The hot-and-cold bromance between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions marks its one-year anniversary this week—the President nommed Jefferson Beauregard for the job exactly one year ago this Friday—but the odds of it surviving another month are starting to look slim indeed.
Roy Moore becomes more toxic by the hour. Giving Sessions their old Senate seat back could solve a lot of problems for Republicans.
Earlier today, the New York Times' Sheryl Gay Stolberg floated a potential exit strategy that looks more viable than anything we've seen to date. It's essentially a baseball trade: Sessions for Roy Moore and an interim attorney general to be named later.
Moore, of course, is the Alabama Republican candidate for US Senate who becomes more politically toxic by the hour. The latest polls have them actually behind a Democrat in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate in nearly three decades.
After initially waffling, Senate Republicans and party elders are now pitching themselves off the burning Moore bandwagon, calling on the controversial judge to step down before more damage is done. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved from the “if true” stance to a full-on condemnation of Moore: “I believe the women, yes,” McConnell said. In the White House and on Capitol Hill, the talk among Republican leaders has moved from saving Moore's candidacy to saving the seat.
Quoting Stolberg:
One idea now being discussed under this scenario, brought up by two different White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, would be for Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama to immediately appoint Attorney General Jeff Sessions to what had been their seat when it becomes vacant again. Mr. Sessions remains highly popular among Alabama Republicans, but their relationship with President Trump has waned since they recused themselves from the investigation of the role that Russia played in last year's campaign.
Does that even work within Alabama's rules of succession? Who knows. Everybody's just spitballing at this point. But it's worth nothing that so, so, so many problems could be solved with this move.
Trump finally jettisons Sessions, who's been in The Donald's doghouse for months, due to their refusal to halt, delay, or otherwise interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
For Sessions, the move allows them to get out from under their boss's torment while saving face and coming out as the good guy. They take one for the party and remains politically relevant and employed.
For Republicans, it solves the ever-deepening problem of Roy Moore, removing an embarrassing seat-loser and replacing them with Sessions, whose statewide popularity would assumedly carry them to an easy write-in victory against Democrat Doug Jones.
For Roy Moore…well, Roy Moore has issues that won't be solved by this move. But that's on him.
And what would such a move mean for cannabis legalization? I think it would effectively carry legalization across the finish line. By the time a post-Sessions Justice Department regains its bearings under a new leader, California will have opened its recreational cannabis system. The world's single largest legal cannabis market will be a fait accompli.
Sessions has had nearly a year to knock legalization off its rails. And he's done nothing.
Look at it this way. Jeff Sessions was nominated about two weeks after California voted to legalize adult-use cannabis. They and President Trump have had nearly a full year to knock that process off the rails—something Sessions has made clear is their fondest desire. It's a rare month that passes without Sessions making some public comment about the ridiculous, outlandish nature of marijuana laws in the 29 medical and eight adult-use states. And yet they have done nothing—not one thing—about it. As their fellow Alabamians might put it, ol' JB is all bark and no bite.
Who Follows Sessions?
Probably Rod Rosenstein, the current deputy attorney general. He'd serve as the interim AG, possibly for the remainder of Trump's term. It's possible that Trump could name someone like Chris Christie to the job, but that would require Senate confirmation, and Senate Democrats might insist upon the new AG's recusal from the Russia investigation. That's the card up Rosenstein's sleeve, in Trump's eyes: Unlike Sessions, they haven't recused themselves from Mueller's investigation.
Rod Rosenstein could be more of a Dick Cheney-style operator: pulling levers behind the scenes, getting stuff done.
The risk for cannabis legalization is that Rosenstein could prove to be all bite and no bark. Sessions likes to holler but they don't seem to be all that great at getting things done when it comes to cannabis.
Rosenstein, by contrast, could be an operator more in the Dick Cheney mode—moving gears and pulling levers ten hours a day, instead of spending their time yakking with the likes of Hugh Hewitt. We don't know exactly where Rosenstein stands on state-legal cannabis. It's a fair bet that he's less exercised by the issue than Sessions, but they may also choose to use cannabis to make a statement about the supremacy of federal law over state legalization.
Time is on Our Side
Whatever the outcome, it's a game of musical chairs that could further delay any federal action against state-legal cannabis.
And in some ways that's the best we can hope for at this point. Because with every passing day, the state of California's legal cannabis infrastructure grows and gains strength. Up north, Canada's federal government and its provinces work diligently to build a well-regulated legal cannabis industry.
By this time next year, we may not be celebrating the anniversary of the Trump-Sessions relationship. But we will be enjoying the benefits of legal cannabis in two of the world's largest markets, and that progress will be nearly impossible to reverse.

A student group investigating the Koch brothers' influence on Kansas University has received some of the $1,800 worth of documents it requested from the university.
Schuyler Kraus, KU senior and president of Students for a Sustainable Future, said that they believe the documents returned so far reinforce their group's concern that the Kochs are buying their way into the university and spreading their political ideology under the guise of academia. School of Business representatives — including one of the faculty members students are looking into — dispute that theory.
Students for a Sustainable Future paid KU in September to fulfill an expansive record request seeking documents elucidating donations and associated restrictions by Koch family foundations, plus the hiring process of three teachers in the School of Business.
KU is still preparing portions of the request.
“Students for a Sustainable Future's request sought 10 years of emails for several professors, so the time required to obtain and review this information is understandably substantial,” KU spokesperson Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said. “Because the emails are from professors, they must be reviewed to ensure that private student information or information about in-progress research — both of which are protected — is not included.”
Just before Thanksgiving, the students did receive records related to KU's hiring of Art Hall, founding executive director of the Center for Applied Economics within the School of Business; George Bittlingmayer, Wagnon Distinguished Professor of Finance and Otto Distinguished Professor of Austrian Economics; and Koleman Strumpf, Koch Professor in Business Economics.
Kraus said they were chosen because of their ties or possible ties to conservative activists Charles and David Koch, billionaires who own Wichita-based Koch Industries.
“Although they (the Kochs) don't have direct control over the curriculum, if they have control over the hiring procedure they effectively do,” Kraus said.
According to documents Students for a Sustainable Future shared with the Journal-World:
KU first hired Hall in 2004. Their employment offer for the 2012-13 school year lists their annual salary as $108,000 and notes: “A contingent upon funding designation indicates that this position is partially or fully funded by restricted funds, grants, funds contingent upon grants, or endowed funds.”
From 1997 to 2004, Hall was a chief economist for the Public Sector Group of Koch Industries Inc., according to their resume. They have a doctoral degree in economics, previously held a number of government and private sector jobs and taught economics at Baker University's Wichita campus and the University of Georgia.
Bittlingmayer, who has an extensive background in academia, joined KU in 2000 after 12 years at University of California, Davis.
When KU sought a candidate for its Koch Professorship in Business Economics, Bittlingmayer led the search and hired Strumpf — who has a doctorate from MIT and undergraduate degrees from Stanford — in 2006 with an initial salary of $145,000.
KU's job description for the professorship explains that it is “part of a broader initiative aimed at promoting economic research with policy relevance. That initiative includes the recently established Center for Applied Economics.”
Details about the Center's path to establishment aren't provided on its website.
An endowed gift was made in 2003, according to the business school. However, KU Endowment spokesperson Lisa Scheller said Tuesday that they did not have the authority to provide more information, as it relates to a private gift.
Kraus said they were disappointed that the hiring portion of their request did not yield more records, including conflict of interest disclosures as requested.
Documents show the Koch Professorship was posted, advertised and yielded a number of applicants, two of which were recommended for interview. But Kraus noted that if similar searches took place for Hall's and Bittlingmayer's jobs, KU did not provide records that show it.
Students for a Sustainable Future is also analyzing syllabi, required readings and publications to identify how much promotes Koch ideology, Kraus said.
They said they understand universities are cash-strapped and eager for donations, but they believe those funds should come with more transparency. They said the Kochs “exemplify” a problem happening in other academic fields with strong ties to industry.
“I want academia to be a place that is honest and truthful,” Kraus said. “I want it to be a place we can look to for genuine, honest research.”
Neeli Bendapudi, who became KU Business dean in 2011, has defended the school, saying Hall and other faculty members alike are required to have strong credentials and, when presenting viewpoints in different forums, required to qualify those as their own.
Hall said no one at Koch is telling them what to teach.
“Absolutely not,” they said.
They said KU invited them to interview for their job and that they do not know “what other options were on the table” for the position. They said they did not pre-arrange to take the job with the Koch Family Foundations but that people there knew they were looking for an opportunity to get back into public policy work and were probably talking to KU.
Hall said they typically approach their own analyses from a market-based perspective, a philosophy shared by Charles Koch and lauded in their book “The Science of Success: How Market Based Management Built the World's Largest Private Company.”
Hall reiterated the issue of academic freedom.
“When there's a point of view being expressed that's part of academic freedom,” they said. “If I'm testifying before the Legislature I'm mandated by KU policy to say that my opinions are my own.”
The Koch investigation is the only project right now for Students for a Sustainable Future, which has about 10 active members, Kraus said. Members are communicating with students investigating the same thing at other universities, and they've formed a network, online at unkochmycampus.org.
Disney is refusing, thus far, to buckle to hackers' ransomware demands to return the new edition of Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.
Deadline Hollywood reported that Disney CEO Bob Iger has gone to the FBI, rather than pay a huge amount of Bitcoins to the ransomware hackers to recover the latest Pirates of the Caribbean sequel. The first several episodes generated $3.75 billion at the box office.
The WannaCrypt virus, better known as “WannaCry,” worm-spread over the weekend at the rate of about 5,000 computers an hour. It exploited known vulnerabilities of servers running Microsoft software that had not been updated with the existing Windows Defender's MS17-010 anti-virus security patch, or are so old they are no longer supported.
The WannaCry ransomware also exploits a Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) vulnerability developed by the U.S. National Security Agency and disclosed on Twitter last month by the infamous ShadowBrokers hacker auction site.
Cybersecurity Ventures estimated WannaCry-induced financial losses at about $4 billion, before Disney late last night confirmed to ABC employees that the movie was being held hostage. Hollywood's other big media property caught up in the WannaCry ransomware hack is Netflix's Orange is the New Black.
Huge corporations like Disney and Netflix employ very sophisticated security professionals and spend big bucks to license top-notch anti-virus software. But the thousands of financially struggling creative individuals, and hundreds of small specialized vendors, who service the media giants lack appropriate security tools, which is providing criminals with an open door to steal intellectual property treasures.
Despite estimated global corporate investment plans to spend $1 trillion on computer security over the next four years, annual cybercrime losses are expected to grow from $3 trillion in 2015 to a $6 trillion a year in 2021.
Global damage from the WannaCry virus was limited after a researcher at Malware Tech accidentally discovered a “kill switch” over the weekend.
Back in June last year, while the Survivor: Game Changers cast were battling it out on an island in Fiji, I reached out to a selection of former players to get their thoughts and predictions on the returning castaways. Over the next couple of weeks, I will be posting those interviews here on Inside Survivor, one every weekday.
Spencer Bledsoe, the runner-up of Survivor: Cambodia, has participated in two seasons of Survivor, the first of which they played alongside Survivor: Game Changers cast member, Tony Vlachos. The relationship between the two men was up and down throughout Survivor: Cagayan, at times going to battle over idols and advantages, other times working together to blindside unsuspecting tribemates. No matter what Spencer did, the “young lad” always seemed one step behind the self-proclaimed “King of the Jungle.” Through all their back and forth gameplay, Spencer grew to respect Tony and at the Final Tribal Council, not only did Spencer give Tony their vote, but they vouched for their victory in front of the entire jury.
Inside Survivor reached out to Spencer to get their thoughts on Tony's return to Survivor: Game Changers.
Disclaimer: This interview was conducted in June 2016 while Survivor: Game Changers was still filming in Fiji.
1) Hey Spencer, thanks for doing this. In Survivor: Cagayan, in your jury speech, you said that Tony played in a way that honored the game. What was it about Tony's game that you respected so much?
It's hard to put coach-talk into explicit and supportable words, but what I respected so much was that Tony went into the game with a strong sense of self and a purpose, and followed through on that purpose more than any player I've witnessed. The term “give 100%” is thrown around pretty loosely in culture, but Tony damn near did it. They literally looked hours and hours for idols, and when they realized he'd come under suspicion for that, they crafted crab traps for the sole purpose of pretending to check the traps and buying five minutes here or there to look for idols. They combed through the entire beach. They didn't sleep. They had a grind and a will in playing hard and maximizing their chances that I don't think has ever been replicated.
2) On TV, we saw Tony searching for idols, building spy-shacks, and all of this other manic behavior. Can you describe a little what it was actually like living with Tony day to day? Was they on the move 24/7, or was there another side to Tony that we perhaps didn't see as much?
This answer is definitive – they were always on the move and buzzing. I think Tony is literally incapable of sitting still and not meddling, which is incredibly fun to watch. I was walking down a trail with them one day when they jumped, startled and freaked out. They informed me that they thought they saw a monkey chasing us, but it was just their mind playing tricks on them after not sleeping. Maybe the joke was on me, and this was their elaborate way of getting people to underestimate him, but it'll be fun to watch regardless.
3) Many people give Trish credit for Tony's success. They were a loyal ally that helped ground them and put out fires that they caused. Is that accurate? And if so, do you think without that person to anchor him, they could go off the rails this season?
It is true that Trish put out a ton of fires for Tony, most crucially with Jefra. Is it true that they deserve credit for their win? Not in my book. Every winner has their strokes of luck, and allies as good as Trish and Woo were Tony's. I do hope he's reflected on that and is prepared not to have them, though. I imagine after winning it's easy to be content playing the same game and not reflecting on how one could improve.
4)  They are obviously coming into this season with a huge target on their back. How do you think they will change their game? How would you play it in their position?
I think with a new group of people, Tony does have an opportunity to fight the target on their back by playing up everything that makes them seem non-strategic. On merge night in Cagayan, I mentally wrote Tony off as a Jersey Shore alternate when they (literally) shouted into the night, as we slept, “Yeah, that's right we f****** canned Lindsay, that dumb ******, that's what happens! Pop!! Bang bang!”
Sure, these returnees have seen that Tony was perceived that way and won anyway, but they might come to trust their in-person read of Tony against their better judgment. I wouldn't underestimate the ability of returnees with egos to underestimate people.
5) What is Tony's main positive attribute? And, what is their main negative attribute?
Positive – Tony has more of what you call “street smarts” than anyone I've ever met. By the end of the season, people will be afraid to even try lying to him.
Negative – They will likely be a strategic force that people want to blindside as the game goes on, and as the immunities get more puzzle-dependent, they may not win it when the whack is coming.
6) There is another former Cagayan castaway on this season, Tony's old Cops R Us partner, Sarah Lacina. How do you think their relationship will be out on the island? Is there still bad blood there?
I don't know what they've discussed, but I'm sure they've talked pregame on some level. I do think Tony's made a big effort to make amends, and that there's not too much bitterness leftover from last time.
7) Who on this cast do you see as Tony's biggest competition?
Ciera Eastin. Playing with Second Chancers definitely changed some of my opinions, and no one's stock went up more in my mind than hers. They can lie as well as Tony can, and is likable and authentic. Amazing player.
8) On the flip-side, who here is good for Tony's game? Who do you think they should align with?
Aubry Bracco. I think Aubry is Tony's perfect complement and would bring long-term thinking and cerebral strategy to a partnership.
9) Given that Tony is going to be back on our screens soon, does this mean we will see a return of your Fireside Chats on Twitter?
10) Putting you on the spot here, how far do you think Tony will make it (or feel free to give a percentage)? And secondly, who is your pick to win it all?
I already kinda gave away my faith in Ciera, but to throw out another name for a winner pick, I can definitely see Malcolm Freberg winning.
As for Tony, I think he's either winning or a pre-merge boot.
11) Before we let you go, what is new in the world of Spencer? How has life been since we last saw you in Survivor: Cambodia?
Life's genuinely awesome. My days consist of trading, exercising, eating really well and meditating, and things are as good as ever. It doesn't hurt that it's been a blast watching Survivor lately, as it's continued a hot streak since arguably Season 25. I have faith Tony will be a big part of that hot streak reaching ten seasons.
Added 02/04/17: I'm also working on a podcast I just started called “Redeeming Disorder.” The goal is to bring on subjects who've struggled with mental disorders and break down the stigma by talking through their personal stories. While it's different than Survivor, of course, it reminds me of Survivor's ability to really let us into someone's world because what we're viewing is authentic. I'm so excited to do that with mental illness – an issue close to my heart. After one season my co-host, Laura, and I are thrilled with what we're making, and I'm extremely passionate about continuing both the journey with the podcast and in the mental health space in general.
Thanks again to Spencer for taking part. For more on Tony, you can check out their cast retrospective and official cast bio. Stay tuned to Inside Survivor for more Playing With Game Changers interviews. Survivor: Game Changers premieres March 8, 2017, on CBS.
Image caption Capt Leonard Egland was found dead of a gunshot wound on Sunday
A US Army captain has been found dead after killing four people in two states and wounding two officers during the ensuing manhunt, authorities said.
Capt Leonard Egland, 37, killed their ex-wife, their boyfriend and the boyfriend's young son on Saturday, police said.
As Hurricane Irene swept through the east coast, they fled with their daughter into Pennsylvania, where they killed their ex-mother-in-law, police said.
They were found dead of a gunshot wound on Sunday. The girl was unharmed.
Egland had served in the US Army for nearly two decades and had deployed numerous times to war zones, authorities said. It was unclear what drove them to kill.
'Dangerous situation'
Authorities said that on Saturday, Capt Egland, based at Fort Lee, Virginia, shot dead their former wife Carrie Egland, their boyfriend and their boyfriend's young son at a house in Chesterfield, Virginia.
They drove north into Pennsylvania as the leading edge of Hurricane Irene began to pummel the area with high winds and heavy rain.
Image caption The hunt forced police to divert resources from the storm response
They arrived in Buckingham, Pennsylvania that night, where they broke into the house of their former mother-in-law Barbara Reuhl.
They then shot them to death, Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler told the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper.
Next, they dropped their daughter off at a local hospital, where they threatened a hospital worker with a handgun.
Officers caught up with Egland on the rainy, flooding roads, and they exchanged gunfire, Egland shooting a rifle, police said.
One police officer was shot in the hand and another wounded by broken glass in the gun fight, authorities said.
"It was bad," Warwick Township, Pennsylvania Police Chief Mark Goldberg told the Associated Press. "Weather conditions were horrible and it was a very dangerous situation."
Egland escaped, but police found their truck in the early hours of Sunday morning, and their dead body in a bin that afternoon.
There were conflicting reports in the US media about how Egland died, with some indicating that they had shot himself, although police refused to confirm that to the Associated Press.
Image caption The house which was being used as a brothel in Letterkenny
Public health agencies on both sides of the border are urging anyone who used a County Donegal brothel to seek urgent medical advice.
It emerged on Thursday that a prostitute working at the Letterkenny brothel is HIV positive.
It prompted a senior Irish police officer to appeal for anyone who thinks they may be at risk to contact their GP.
Superintendent Vincent O'Brien said people operating brothels would be met with the full rigour of the law.
The deputy editor of the Donegal News, Charlie Joe McGinley, broke the story
"It all came to light at Glenties District Court when two foreign nationals - a Spanish woman and a Brazilian - were convicted and fined for prostitution offences.
"In the course of the case one of the prostitutes confirmed that they were HIV positive.
"Arising from that court case Superintendent Vincent O'Brien made an unprecedented appeal for any member of the public who has engaged in the services of a prostitute to immediately seek medical advice.
"He said this was so serious they had also referred the matter to the Health Promotion Unit who will be liaising with their colleagues in Northern Ireland because the clients using this brothel were also from Northern Ireland.
"We have indications of up to 100 people a week from Donegal and Derry using this brothel.
"There is a very clinical aspect to this and the gardai are not taking it lightly."
A Regina woman who was choked unconscious and brutally raped by an HIV-positive stranger in a downtown back alley in May 2015 suffered months of anxiety over whether they had contracted the virus.
The risk of transmission turned out to be nearly zero, forcing the Crown to reconsider its criminal charge. But the prosecutor has since argued that the victim's fear should still be considered when a Regina judge sentences Kenton Desjarlais, 26, Monday afternoon.
I felt my body shut down limb by limb, muscle by muscle... - Victim impact statement
"Initially, it was believed to be what made the sexual assault an 'aggravated' sexual assault," senior Crown prosecutor Chris White said.
However, evidence from an infectious disease specialist at the preliminary hearing revealed that Desjarlais was taking antiretroviral drugs regularly. The drugs suppressed their virus to a low enough level that transmission was nearly impossible, and thus their HIV-positive status couldn't endanger the woman's life.
The Crown initially charged Desjarlais with aggravated sexual assault because they were HIV-positive, but prosecutor Chris White had to abandon that argument. (CBC News)
Desjarlais was still convicted of aggravated sexual assault, but because they choked the victim.
White asked for a minimum 12-year sentence, and argued that the victim's fear of contracting HIV was real, although the actual risk was not.
"However low the risk is, the anxiety for the victim when they found out that this individual was in fact HIV-positive, is an aggravating factor," White told CBC News.
'A terrified fighter'
On May 16, 2015, the 28-year old victim was on their way home around 12:45 a.m. after socializing with friends at a downtown pub. A male friend accompanied them until they were a half block from their apartment, not far from Hotel Saskatchewan.
As they cut through a back alley, Desjarlais rode their bicycle alongside them and started making lewd comments and touching them
The well-educated, ambitious young woman described in their victim impact statement how they felt fear like never before. Previously "a happy, confident, independent, strong, easy-going woman," that night they turned into "a terrified fighter."
When Desjarlais tackled them in front of a dumpster, they gouged their eyes and scratched their face — but they choked them unconscious.
The risk of transmission is very, very close to zero, if not zero altogether. - Dr. Alex Wong, infectious diseases specialist
In their victim impact statement, they said, "I felt like I was leaving this earth forever."
"I felt my body shut down limb by limb, muscle by muscle … my voice, my lips, my eyelids … then my mind."
When they came to, their pants and underwear were pushed down, and Desjarlais had forcibly penetrated them
The victim eventually escaped. After Desjarlais was arrested, and they learned that they were HIV-positive, they faced four weeks of potent post-exposure antiretroviral drugs and six months of anxiety while they waited for negative test results.
As it turned out, Desjarlais was routinely taking antiretroviral drugs, at least 90 per cent of the time. The virus was essentially undetectable in their blood.
Dr. Alex Wong, an infectious diseases specialist in Regina, told CBC news people often wrongfully assume that HIV-transmission is automatic.
"For people who are HIV-positive who are responsible, i.e. taking medications and fully-suppressed, I do think we need to be mindful of the fact the risk of transmission is very, very close to zero, if not zero altogether."
Medical advances and the justice system
Most of the HIV-related prosecutions in Canada involve sexual relationships that were considered consensual at the time, but that led to prosecution because the HIV-positive partner failed to disclose their or their status.
In 2012, the Supreme Court clarified that people with low-level HIV who also use condoms during sex cannot be charged with aggravated sexual assault for nondisclosure.
HIV activists opposed that criteria as too stringent, arguing that with medical advances that reduce transmission risk, it's not necessary to have both a low viral load and wear a condom.
Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Alex Wong says there's basically no risk of transmission if an HIV-positive person regularly takes medication and manages the virus. (CBC)
"Adding a condom to that equation really negligibly changes the risk, because the risk to begin with is approaching zero or basically zero," said Dr. Wong.
Wong says it's significant that prosecutors in this case recognized that medical advances had reduced transmission risk, despite the lack of condom use, to the point an aggravated sexual assault charge wasn't justified for that reason.
Perception of risk vs. real risk
At the sentencing hearing in May, both the Crown and Defence recognized that the victim's fear of transmission could be considered an aggravating factor in the sentence.
In their victim impact statement, they said that they suffered months of uncertainty alone, unwilling to burden their friends and family with the "HIV scare" until they found out they were negative.
Kenton Desjarlais told a Court of Queen's Bench judge, 'I am not a monster.' (CBC News)
The woman said they also have trouble leaving the house and fears strangers.
They said that when their rapist is released from prison, they will be forced to relocate to another city.
"If I don't, I know I will become a recluse and the cycle of fear and depression will begin all over again," the woman told the court.
'I am not a monster'
Desjarlais' sentencing was delayed three weeks to July 24 to allow Justice Brian Barrington-Foote time to review a Gladue Report, a special pre-sentencing hearing into an Indigenous perpetrator's background.
They have a long criminal record, although no previous sexual assaults, dating back to when they were 12.
At the last court appearance, Desjarlais apologized and said: "Despite what I've done I am not a bad person. I am not a monster."
The Defence is asking for a five-year prison sentence.
The Crown has argued that other aggravating factors include the brutality of the assault, and the fact it was a random attack that "sent a chill through the city."
Steve Jobs's vision of a world full of iPhones, iPads, and iPods would be impossible without cheap foreign labor
AP
"Designed by Apple in California Assembled in China" is etched into the glossy black of every iPhone. The designer is mourned and deified the world over, but the assemblers are huddled in anonymity. Indeed, the story of Apple's rise over the last decade is as much America's story as it is China's. If Steve Jobs, donned in their uniform of jeans and black pullover, was the general who led the battle for global digital technology supremacy, then it took hundreds of thousands of their troops in factory overalls and static-free scrubs to realize their vision with precision and consistency.
That the foot soldiers of Apple's meteoric ascendancy are Chinese has received nary a mention in the flood of hagiographies on the late industry titan. That's understandable: Jobs was an iconic iconoclast who thrived as a business person and as the envy of their field. The revolution they ushered in transforming consumer behavior and the portable device frontier deserves to be praised. Theirs was a quintessentially American story of risk-tolerant entrepreneurs who sought the ideal and succeeded to an inimitable degree. Product of an immigrant father and college drop-out, Jobs personified the unique cultural and social milieu of Silicon Valley, one that has spawned endless, though mostly unsuccessful, imitators. They embodied one of the defining narratives of what's best about America writ large, that it is an inventor of the future, time and again. That is how progress is done.
How much do you love your cat? Really, how much? Would you consider purchasing an entire home specifically designed to make life as pleasant as possible for your favorite feline? If so, Japanese homebuilder Asahi Kasei may have just what you're looking for. And for the hardcore cat lover, it just might be—sorry can't resist—the cat's meow.
An abundance of exposed beams, elevated platforms and built-in steps provide your cat with plenty of exercise options, and also the perfect vantage point from which to look down on you with an appropriate degree of aloofness and sense of superiority.
Pet doors guarantee your cat the run of the house, and indoor gratings mean your window insect screens will, for the first time since the little fuzz ball became part of your life, last an entire summer.
And let's not forget the litter box! Kasei has a few options to ensure your cat can get the privacy, cleanliness and comfort it undoubtedly believes it deserves. Can the luxury and hygiene of a specially designed washlet toilet for cats be far behind?

Last week, Google released an update to Google Maps for iOS with one major change - Material Design. This is one of the headline features of Google's latest Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system.
One of the goals of Google's Material Design programme is to "develop a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes". True to that, Google Maps for iOS 4.0.0 looks almost identical to its Android counterpart. And as a result, the app now looks completely out of place on iOS.
With Material Design, Google's aim is to create a user interface that is consistent across apps; one that looks good, is intuitive and has smooth animations. That's the theory, anyway.
Google Maps' blog post announcing the release of the latest Google Maps mentions a few other things: "Bold colours and textures are in-and Google Maps is on trend, with a slick new style to make traveling with Maps even easier."
In practice things don't work out as well.
Thanks to the new design, using Google Maps on iOS is a jarring experience, that makes you feel like you're switching between different operating systems every time you load the app.
What Google seems to have ignored is that apps are not websites - a good website will offer a consistent look no matter which platform you open it from. On the other hand, a good app blends into the platform, and feels like a natural part of your device. That's not just our opinion either - Google has the same view when it comes to apps running on Android.
In the above video, Google employees talk about designing apps for Android and they stress on the fact that the app should use interface elements native to the OS. An important point for developers is to "make sure that you're not blindly copying the exact png assets across platforms."
Google's own guidelines for Android developers also mention this: "For any icon in your existing set where the symbol is different from Android's, use Android's symbol but give it your brand's styling."
Google's Material Design apps do the opposite of this and the result is that using them on iOS feels jarring. Apple pundit and design critic John Gruber wrote:
"Follow the idioms and standards of the platform you're writing for" is good sound advice. But Google is doing just the opposite with nearly all of their iOS apps. They're not adhering to iOS design idioms - they're adhering to their own Material Design style. Look no further than the "sharing" button in the iOS YouTube app - it's Android's.
While there is no official Google statement on this design choice, Matias Duarte, Vice President Design, Google wrote this on Google+ last year, in response to a question about Google using Android share icons in its iOS apps: "The share icon Google uses in its properties (and the share icon that Android endorses) is a popular opensource icon and one that we feel well describes the connective nature of sharing. In a sense you could say we believe it is part of our brand and that Google's brand is to embrace the open and universal standard."
iOS has a native sharing icon that everyone recognises (left) but Google's YouTube app (right) prefers to use one Android users would be more comfortable with.
It's rather convenient for Google to claim that its own standards are the de facto open and universal standard. Critics of Google's iOS apps feel that the company's design choices smack of arrogance. You can even argue that Google is consciously avoiding native iOS design in order to stamp its branding on its biggest rival.
Marco Arment, an iOS app developer who made apps such as Instapaper and Overcast, wrote in a post responding to Duarte's justification for using Android icons on iOS: "Maybe it's just my inability to understand anything Matias Duarte ever says, but I see this as Google's typical bullshit, insulting our intelligence as they push a self-serving corporate branding initiative and sheer arrogance as an inevitable, morally imperative 'open standard'."
Arment adds in the post, "Why not tell the truth? Google's apps don't use the iOS share icons because Google doesn't respect iOS and thinks its standard UI widgets are better, even in their iOS apps, on a platform surrounded by other apps that all use the standard iOS share icon."
This post was written a day before Google released the Material Design update for Google Maps on iOS, and until then, the debate around Google's UI design for iOS was over minor elements such as the share icon in YouTube for iOS. The same YouTube app has a menu that uses iOS fonts and a transparency effect in line with native iOS 7 design. However, it's only a matter of time until YouTube gets its Material Design update, after which Google will have a suite of Android-ish apps (Gmail, Inbox by Google, Google Maps and YouTube being the most popular ones) on iOS.
Arment highlights this by writing: "Secondarily, it reinforces their branding and makes the rest of iOS feel just a little bit more alien to people who heavily buy into the Google ecosystem, reducing iOS' lock-in and making it cognitively easier to switch away."
Google's attempt at giving iOS users a taste of its Material Design UI feels as if it is trying too hard to force Android down their throat. Google's strategy could pay off, and some people may eventually decide that they like Material Design better than iOS's UI. But there's an equal chance of people just looking for apps that feel at home on iOS.
A Tennessee family is grieving this week after their teenage son was killed struggling with two gunmen who broke into the family's Nashville home on Tuesday night, PEOPLE confirms.
Ja'Donte Thompson, 17, was fatally shot in the scuffle with the home invaders. Their grandmother said they took the bullet for their mother.
Get push notifications with news, features and more.
Shirley Whitlow told local station WZTV, “When they heard what was going on, they came and protected their mother. They died protecting their mother.”
According to the Metro Nashville Police Department, there were four people in the house — in bed — when the gunmen kicked in the back door and went to the bedrooms demanding money.
The men pistol-whipped Thompson's stepfather before leaving without taking anything, police said. They suspect the would-be robbers possibly went to the wrong house.
So far, investigators have made no arrests in the case.

Thompson recently took a job at Top Golf to help pay for Christmas gifts, and their great aunt Cotina Hancock told the Tennessean: “It's a shame. They were a great kid.”
“He was very talented in numerous ways,” cousin Lovely Horton tells PEOPLE. “He was smart and amazing. … They have never been a trouble kid. We will miss them dearly.”
Thompson was a fairly new student at Hillsboro High School in Nashville. The school's executive principal tells PEOPLE, “We are very saddened and still have many people working through the process of grieving.” The school has brought in counselors to work with students.

In a statement, the school district said they “had a positive impact on their classmates, teachers and staff…teachers said they were a good example of an aspiring leader. This is a tragic loss.”
Friends of the family have set up an online fundraiser to help pay for funeral, which is set for Monday. (A call to the family was not immediately returned.)
“He had a permanent smile,” Hancock reportedly said of Thompson. “You could be in a dark place and they could light up the room.”
The suspected gunmen are described as in their late 20s to 30s. One wore a red beanie hat and red jacket and the other wore a mask and all black clothing.

Kivukoni is the biggest fish market in Tanzania's main city, Dar es Salaam. Fish are an important part of the diet for those Tanzanians who live near the country's long coast and many lakes. However, fishermen complain that huge, modern boats from Europe and Asia are taking most of the best fish from their country's waters.
As part of the deal for its boats to fish in Tanzanian waters, Japan built the modern market, which embodies the hustle of the city, and employs about 3,000 people - including ice salespersons, boat repairmen, wood suppliers and traders.
Dozens of youngsters work on the boats, going out to sea in the early hours, and later carting the fish to the traders. In coastal areas, fish is much cheaper than meat but inland and away from the lakes where many people are animal herders, meat is cheaper and fish is seen as a delicacy.
Rajabu Mungi, 24, finished school five years ago and came to work on the boats. They earn about 8,000 shillings ($5; £3) each day.
After the early-morning trading is done, the workers move to the other side of the market for a well-earned meal.
Ally Iddi, 32, is among those who cook up the fish. They have been in the job for 17 years and brings up three children on their wage.
Many of the traders and cooks sleep near the market in shelters made from tarpaulin and corrugated metal. They are trying to save money to buy land in their home villages.
YEREVAN, JANUARY 27, ARMENPRESS. The Republic of Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora mark the 24th anniversary of the Armenian Army on January 28. The formation of the Armenian Army coincides with 1992-1994, when the newly independent Republic of Armenia, along with Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, being in undeclared but de facto war with Azerbaijan, at the same time embarked on the creation of a national army. Declaration of Independence of 1900 however, played a decisive role in the creation of the Armenian army which declared Armenia's independence and opened new legal and practical perspectives for the creation of national army.
As “Armenpress” reports, on January 28, 1992, Armenian government made a historical decision on “Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Armenia” thus legally announcing on the creation of the Armenian Army. Armenian Defense Ministry fulfilled the first draft in the territory of the Republic creating the tendency on filling the army with recruits.
Establishment of the Armenian Army passed through several stages. The first phase lasted from 1988 February until 1992 May. In this period, assuring security of the population of Armenia and Artsakh military became more urgent.
Second stage lasted from 1992 June to 1994 May. In this period, significant work has been carried out in the army on raising combat readiness of troops, strengthening discipline, training of personnel and ensuring progress over army-society relations.
Special regiment of Yerevan was established in September, 1990. By the decision of government of the Republic of Armenia, State Defense Committee was established under the Council of Ministers in 1991.

opportunities and expanded capacities have, in one form or another, presented themselves to you. Some big, some little. Some are heart, relational, or community centered - some are mental, conceptual, and/or creatively centered - and some are more inner expansive, soul/spirit and physical body centered. These are, in a nutshell, the many aspects of your multi-dimensional selves seeking not only integration and balance but also form and expression within and throughout the Collective Higher Mind and Self. Because the overall harmonization of the 5D-7D Higher Collective Mind/Web of Life, has now reached a culmination state of such balanced alignment, integration and increased flow, due to the continued success of the Star-Bursts of Light, Information, and Opportunity. It's been a very busy week for you has it not? So many newand expandedhave, in one form or another, presented themselves to you. Some big, some little. Some are heart, relational, or community centered - some are mental, conceptual, and/or creatively centered - and some are more inner expansive, soul/spirit and physical body centered. These are, in a nutshell, the many aspects of your multi-dimensional selves seeking not only integration and balance but alsoandwithin and throughout the Collective Higher Mind and Self. Because the overall harmonization of the 5D-7D Higher Collective Mind/Web of Life, has now reached a culmination state of such balanced alignment, integration and increased flow, due to the continued success of the Resolution, Reclamation, and Soul-Retrieval Sequencing Process , that Higher Mind nodal points are now pulsing forth harmonized
As these star-bursts ignite, they ripple out in higher harmonic expression across the new Web of Life, seeking or calling forth heightened and more potent forms of co-creative expression, manifestation, and communion. For these star-bursts are catalyzing the activation of full "unity consciousness" and/or the "self-awareness" of the 5D-7D Higher Collective Mind/Web of Life. They are also stimulating YOU to heights of expansiveness/wholeness, allowing you to fully BECOME all that you ARE. Therefore, you can palpably feel/sense these highly charged star-bursts, alighting and "quickening" all that lie within and around you, as you continue to "breath in and out" such refined energetics/information.
As a result, all of this activity may leave you feeling a bit disoriented, confused, overwhelmed, tired, anxious and/or excited at times. In fact, you even described this to me as feeling "flash-bombed," meaning there is so much light in your perception/field that you are almost completely blinded by it - making it hard to see or make out any particular form, let alone footing, while awash in such transformative radiance. Please know that these sensations are completely normal, as you've shifted rather rapidly out of the Void and into an explosion of co-creative light/movement. This is also why I noted on several previous occasions, the importance of staying in your center (solar plexus), or seat/throne of Divine Empowerment during this immense co-creative Sequencing Process.
For it is by standing in your center, that you find the courage, strength, energy and confidence to say "yes" to the plethora of opportunities and capacities opening to/for you, in both your newly refined vessel and within the Higher Collective Mind. Even though you may feel a little anxious saying "yes" to these opportunities at first, the more you stay or step back into your Full-Self or "center," the more ease you will have in embracing and incorporating such expansions of perception, experience, and service. As you become a fully authentic, whole, empowered, fully supported, co-creative and self-sovereign expression of Creation, so too does humanity and Gaia as a collective.
Therefore, I am delighted to relay, that the emergence of these star-bursts are very much indicative of another upcoming "activation/ignition" opportunity during/around the April 23/24 Grand Cardinal Cross Alignment. This will be another opportunity for The Event to take place, or for the 5D-7D Higher Collective Mind/Web of Life to become fully "self-aware," as spoken of previously.
To recap what this full "self-awareness" implies, see the excerpts below:
This further emanation of your inner Radiance (energy centers, soul/spirit body) out into the world, along with the Collective Radiance of many others like you, who have now stepped into or have recently "centered" within their own "inner sun" or seat of empowerment, thereby accepting the "keys" or consciously "taking over the driver's seat" of their new, soon to be crystalline vehicle - has now allowed these pathways or flows of information/experience that exist along and throughout Earth's ley-grid and the larger Web of Life, to begin to "source," "seek out," "link-up" and "activate" new nodes or "access points" of connection, communion, co-creation and expression - igniting a complete RADICALIZATION OF THE COLLECTIVE MIND!
In essence, the collective mind is on to fast-track to becoming fully AWARE of itself, at which point it becomes the Collective "Higher" Mind, in every true sense of that phrase. This "awakening" into the Collective Higher Mind is also referred to as "The Event" or the experience of "no separation" or "no-time." And as mentioned before, each being/soul within the Web of Life will experience this home-coming differently depending upon the quality of their own "inner life" or level of soul-growth.
If all energetic pathways/nodes of the newly Expressed/Co-Created Web of Life are able to find sufficiently harmonious resonance and/or vibrational compatibility then the "activation" will be a full success and The Event or Contact will naturally commence.
If you as a Light Warrior community DO succeed, it will be because you CO-CREATED it thusly, by restoring and relinking all Soul/Star Family lineages and their corresponding consciousness/information into the overall "experience" of Gaia (Contact), as they then BECOMES or is finally SEEN in all their 5D (and above for some) splendor. The "veil of separation" finally lifts - a span of collective "no time" is experienced.
All souls will experience this moment of "no time" uniquely, based upon their level of inner growth. And based upon that experience, they will choose, on some level, their next landscape of experience. If, after this moment, a soul is still too unaware to choose, maybe on a conscious level they didn't even know/register that "it" happened, they will then have another opportunity during the next such collective/global moment of "no-time." These moments will happen in waves, each building in length and depth of experience, each wave offering another opportunity for souls to wake up, to SEE, to choose. Up until the time anyway, that this grand ascension/harvest window closes (a way out).
During the remaining window, all platforms (3D, 5D and beyond) of the Web of Life/Collective Mind will exist, offering every soul a plethora of levels to experience and/or inhabit in the coming days, weeks, months, or years ahead based upon their own personal field of vibration/resonance or level of soul-growth/ascension.
To have reached this point of greater harmonization and light across the Web of Life/Collective Mind since the March Equinox Portal, denotes the tremendous effort you and other Warriors of Light have undertaken in recent days to fulfill your roles in each of the To have reached this point of greater harmonization and light across the Web of Life/Collective Mind since the March Equinox Portal, denotes the tremendous effort you and other Warriors of Light have undertaken in recent days to fulfill your roles in each of the 3 Acts of the Sequencing Process . You have all done such an amazing job, that everything now progresses or flows perfectly and potently into the next activation/ascension window or "gateway alignment" later this month.
For as many can all now poignantly feel, something "big" is indeed headed your way. For the star-bursts shall soon give way to cascades of higher energetic union, harmony and flow. Movement will only continue to quicken within and all around you. Including your sweet Gaia, who is experiencing such surges as well, and is adjusting as necessary. Soon, very soon indeed, you will witness this rapid "movement" manifesting in your outer world as the climax of the Sequencing Process and all 3 of it's Acts (Reconciliation, Soul-Retrieval, and Reclamation), naturally leads to the ignition of The Event and/or Higher Collective Self-Awareness, and ALL that comes with that.
In the meantime, I simply ask that you continue your overall efforts in much the same way you have been. Stay vigilantly in your center, continue to look for and embrace opportunities for co-creation, communion, and communication and as always, practice Self-Care, Compassion and Love . Know that you CAN balance, experience, integrate, and contain it ALL. And for heaven's sake, share your wonderful experiences and capacities with others, so that they may be motivated and inspired to see and experience such opportunities and capacities within themselves and others.
For these are exciting days indeed, as ALL fragments are being drawn back to ONENESS/WHOLENESS to be birthed anew, and I cannot even begin to describe to you the number of miraculous manifestations that you are soon to behold! Though in the coming days, I shall do my best to try.
Until then...
A Peterborough man was jailed on Tuesday (7 January) for 13 years after admitting filming themselves raping a four-year-old child, and distributing the video on the internet.
Brett Deane abused the young girl over a period of 16 months, taking dozens of pictures as well as the sickening 52-second film of the rape on their mobile phone.
Brett Deane
The 28-year-old, from Welland Road, Peterborough, even bragged to fellow paedophiles online about the abuse.
They were jailed for 13 years at Peterborough Crown Court after pleading guilty to 10 separate child sex offences. They told the court they had raped the girl about 10 times.
Deane was arrested at their home following an investigation by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), after a tip-off from police in Australia, who uncovered images that Deane was sharing. Deane was tracked down using their email address.
Charles Myatt, prosecuting, said when police seized their mobile phone, they found hundreds of indecent images of children stored on it, with more than 100 taken by Deane of their four-year-old victim.
Other images not taken by Deane but stored on the phone showed abuse being carried out on a child younger than two-years-old.
Deane stared at the floor throughout the sentencing hearing, and was visibly shaking as the distressing facts were read to the court.
Defending, Claire Matthews said: “Nothing I say is intended to detract from the deplorable conduct to which they have pleaded guilty.
“He pleaded guilty on the first opportunity, which prevented their victim from having to be interviewed.  They are filled with remorse, and is utterly bewildered by their own actions.”
Judge Nic Madge, sentencing, said: “The victim will have had emotional and physical trauma caused. Your behaviour is bound to affect how they form relationships in the future.”
Afterwards, Detective Inspector Amerjit Singh welcomed the sentence and said: “The victim is a child, the most innocent of victims out there and Brett Deane committed deplorable acts against her.”
Detective Constable Samantha Jackson added: “I hope the victim can have a fresh start and be able to start their childhood again.”
Factfile: Guilty pleas to 10 offences
Brett Deane entered their guilty pleas to all counts in October. They pleaded guilty to the rape of a child, relating to the incident they filmed, another count of rape, relating to the unknown number of incidents they admitted to, and four counts of sexual assault.
They were given a 10 year sentence for the first count, a 12 year sentence for the second count, and eight years for each sexual assault, to be served concurrently.
They also admitted possessing, distributing, taking and making indecent images of children. They were given a one year sentence for each, concurrently of each other but consecutively to the assault charges.

Derek and Jaime Wells, who literally live on the border, are also divided when it comes to rooting interest in the Bruins-Canadiens series.
DERBY LINE, Vt. — The lines are clearly drawn in this small, quiet town, starting with the border between the United States and Canada that runs through the town's library and even through the home of Derek and Jaime Wells. In the Wells house, the kitchen and bathroom are in Quebec and the living room and bedrooms are in Vermont.
The dividing lines don't end there, however.
Derek is a wicked Bruins fan. Jaime and their stepson are diehard Canadiens fans. On this day, Derek is wearing a green Bruins t-shirt with a shamrock on it; Jaime is wearing a red “Canadiens Hockey'' T-shirt. Therein is the biggest divide, especially during Bruins-Canadiens playoff games.
“Yeah, I scream,'' says Jaime. “Oh yeah, we wear our shirts and we scream.''

Here at the tippy-top of the Northeast Kingdom, it's definitely not all Bruins fans. Montreal is a just 90-minute drive away, while Boston is 3½ hours south.

“My guess is that there's more Canadiens fans here, regardless of which side of the border you're on,” says Nancy Rumery, library director of the Haskell Free Library and Op-era House, which straddles the border.

In the library, a strip of black tape runs through the middle of the International Reading Room, and visitors can sit in Vermont, Quebec, or both.
The library's only entrance is in Vermont, but Canadians can walk across the border from Stanstead and use it without showing a passport to the US Border Patrol, which monitors the front of the building.
According to Rumery, who has lived on the Vermont side since the 1970s, generations of people grew up in this area with limited access to TV channels.

“They all grew up watching ‘Hockey Night in Canada' and Montreal hockey,” they say. “The kids who grew up in this area for years crossed the border to play hockey with Canadian kids. The American high school kids would have to play their home games up until a few years ago in Canada.”
On the bookshelves, which are all on the Quebec side, is an autographed copy of “Orr on Ice,” a 1970 book about the Bruin legend's hockey feats. It has not been checked out since Aug. 4, 2007. The new Bobby Orr autobiography is unavailable. Funds are limited.
Outside the library, US Border Patrol agent John Barney is parked in an SUV. They see a lot of Quebec cars entering Vermont to buy gas and milk at substantially cheaper prices, then return to Canada.
They think the US side has more Bruins fans than Canadiens fans.
“But it's not cut and dried,” they say. “There are a lot of ties to Stanstead still here. You see a lot of Bruins decals on cars but not Canadiens.”

In Stanstead, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer manning the gate won't give their name but says they are a Bruins fan.
“I take a lot of crap because of it,” they say, shaking their head.
The Bruins ‘are very dirty'
Frank Richardi, owner and chef at Lago Trattoria in nearby Newport, Vt., says that Canadiens fans outnumber Bruins fans here, 60 percent to 40 percent.
Richardi played hockey growing up in Braintree, Mass., and their mother's maiden name was Orr. They proudly hang a Bruins jersey in their restaurant. (“It's here to drive you crazy,” they tell Hab fans.)
“When people give me a hard time — and they do — I say, ‘Do you know you come down here and this is the hometown of the guy who started the Bruins and had the Adams Division named after him?”
Few know that local grocery magnate Charles F. Adams paid $15,000 to the NHL on Nov. 1, 1924, for the rights to the first US NHL franchise.
Douglas Henderson, 80, of Derby Line, is a dual citizen, but they never liked the Bruins. As a youngster, they listened to Canadiens games on a transistor radio. To him, the Bruins are big and bad.
“I just don't like the way they play hockey,” they say with a disgusted tone. “They are very dirty. [Zdeno] Chara is just one of them. [Brad] Marchand, every time he's on the ice, he's got to hit somebody from the back. Every single time.
“I hope the Bruins don't win. I always hated the Bruins. Except I loved Bobby Orr. But I think Montreal will win because [Carey] Price is a better goalie.”
Eric Cotnoir, a young carpenter from Newport, is rooting for the Bruins.
“But I'm in a little bit of a minority here,” they say. “The rivalry is similar to the Yankees-Red Sox deal, but it's not like there's going to be fisticuffs over it.”
Back in the library, 6-month-old Rebel Sargent lies on the Quebec side of the International Reading Room. Them oversized children's book stretches into Vermont.
Them mother, Faith, who grew up in Derby Line, is a Canadiens fan. Faith, who works for the state of Vermont, calls the library “an oasis” and yearns for the pre-9/11 atmosphere when the two towns were more like one.
“They used to wave you through because they knew you,” they say. “It's too bad. We miss the community feel, but I understand.
“I just loved the Canadien teams growing up. I'm not a traitor. It just feels like home.”
Marie Josee Dumesnil of Quebec is all for the Habs.
“I know we're going to win — my heart says so,” they say. “A lot of my friends are disgusted with the Canadiens because they haven't won [in decades].
“All I care about is no riots in Montreal. Please don't go and destroy everybody's home, business, and cars. It's terrible what idiots do. We live in a world of idiots.”
They also voiced their disgust with the Boston team.
“The Bruins are dirty,” they say.
They then asks if this will be in the newspaper.
“I don't want anyone to come and break my legs,” they say.
Family fun
In the afternoon, Derek Wells leaves their house, goes past the nine flower pots that the Canadians have used to block the unguarded Church Street crossing, and strolls into the International Reading Room.
With their Bruins shirt on, they immediately gets some grief from a Habs fan — Dwayne Loewen, who sits on the Quebec side.
“I especially liked all the fanned shots and open-net misses,” says Loewen, teasing Wells about Boston's Game 1 double-overtime loss.
Wells, a laborer at a local beef jerky company, never leaves the Green Mountain State. They tease the Canadian about blown leads, then laughs and leaves.
Wells's wife emerges from their home, which has an American flag on the porch. Asked why an American would root for the Canadiens, they laugh.
“Well, I have a lot of French-Canadian ancestry,” says Jaime. “But I went through Wikipedia, and the Boston Bruins team only has five American players on it and the rest are Canadian, so he's really an impostor,” they say of their husband.
“We just poke fun at each other. I told him, ‘Well, I hope your team wins at least one game, so that's it. They can't win any more.' ”
And the yelling that pierces the sleepy border town?
“She gets more worked up than I do,” says Derek, giving their wife a hug. “I only yell when they score.”
Last March, the couple took a road trip to Boston. The Habs stopped the Bruins' 12 game-winning streak with a 2-1 win.
“You can't go to a game with loved ones if you're rooting for opposite teams,'' says Jaime. “I kind of rubbed it in their faces.”
Derek believes the Bruins will win “if they get their stuff together.”
Then they get into their car — which sports a “Go Bruins” decal that depicts a Bruins fan urinating on the Canadiens name — and heads away from the border and off to work.

Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. on Tuesday endorsed a plan to shorten prison sentences for certain inmates as part of their pursuit of administrative reforms they say will make the system more fair to minorities and reduce taxpayer costs.
The proposal would make eligible for reduced sentences about 20,000 of nearly 215,000 inmates in federal prisons, the Justice Department said. Nonviolent, low-level drug offenders without deep criminal ties would qualify for retroactive sentences.
The U.S. Sentencing Commission, which sets guidelines for sentencing federal inmates, is considering the proposal and may vote on it next month.
In April, the commission voted to lower the base offense for criminals caught possessing various amounts of drugs, shortening the average sentence by about 11 months. Mr. Holder's new proposal would make that guidance retroactive — lowering the base offense for those already serving time.
“If your offense was nonviolent, did not involve a weapon, and you do not have a significant criminal history, then you would be eligible to apply for a reduced sentence in accordance with the new rules approved by the commission in April,” Mr. Holder said Tuesday. “Not everyone in prison for a drug-related offense would be eligible. Nor would everyone who is eligible be guaranteed a reduced sentence.
“But this proposal strikes the best balance between protecting public safety and addressing the overcrowding of our prison system that has been exacerbated by unnecessarily long sentences,” they said.

Mr. Holder has made sentencing reform one of their signature issues — aggressively advocating change without waiting for congressional approval. The reforms are part of their so-called “Smart on Crime” initiative that was launched in August and aims to align punishment with the severity of the crime.
In March, Mr. Holder advised federal prosecutors not to press judges to impose longer, mandatory-minimum sentences for certain drug offenses before the U.S. Sentencing Commission had voted to approve guidelines to shorten such sentences.
In April, the attorney general said the Justice Department was going to start looking to expedite requests for clemency, particularly from low-level drug offenders.
Mr. Holder has long argued that the federal system is unfair, especially for minorities, and sentencing reform is one way to level the playing field.
According to the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, more than 60 percent of the people in prison are racial and ethnic minorities. For black men in their 30s, 1-in-10 is in prison or jail on any given day — largely because of drug-related offenses.
Reducing mandatory-minimums also will save the billions of dollars, the Justice Department argues. Maintaining federal prisons devours 25 percent of the Justice's budget, about $6.4 billion annually, according to the department's statistics.
Not all agree that reducing mandatory-minimums is a good idea, and some argue that reform should be effected by Congress, not executive action.
Reducing the amount of time low-level drug offenders serve in jail will lead to fewer drug kingpins being convicted and increase the amount of crime on the streets, a former U.S. attorney testified before a congressional panel last month.
“In reflecting upon my 33 years of public service as a state and federal prosecutor, my experience has clearly shown to me that our success in the pursuit of drug organizations relies upon mandatory-minimum sentences to induce lower-level dealers and conspirators to testify against the higher-level dealers,” Eric Evenson told the House Committee on the Judiciary. “Without them, many, if not most, of these lower-level defendants would simply refuse to cooperate and testify.”
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican and chairperson of the Judiciary Committee, has expressed concern over Mr. Holder taking action without waiting for reforms to be made in Congress.
The Senate has a proposal to cut mandatory-minimum drug sentences in half. Sponsored by Sens. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, and Mike Lee, Utah Republican, Senate Bill S1410 is seen as a candidate for floor action before summer recess.
The House is evaluating its own version of the bill, and the House Committee on the Judiciary has been running a series of hearings examining federal over-criminalization and lowering mandatory minimums.
“One ever-present hurdle to reform in this and other areas is the repeated actions by this administration to circumvent Congress' constitutional role in drafting, considering, and passing legislation important to the American people,” Mr. Goodlatte said during a May 30 prison reform hearing.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Sentencing Commission held a hearing on whether to make the new guidelines retroactive for current inmates, taking testimony from witnesses, including Georgia U.S. Attorney Sally Yates and Bureau of Prisons Director Charles Samuel, who formally delivered Mr. Holder's endorsement.
“While we believe finality in sentencing should remain the general rule, and with public safety our foremost goal, we also recognize that sentences imposed for some drug defendants under the current sentencing guidelines are longer than necessary,” Mrs. Yates testified. “And this creates a negative impact upon both the public's confidence in the criminal justice system and our prison resources.”

Republican leaders, both in Congress and on the presidential campaign, are engaging in the harshest criticism of the Federal Reserve in a generation, with some Republican leaders writing a letter to complain that the Fed's efforts were potentially harming the economy, and some Democrats in the House arguing, in turn, that the Fed is not doing enough to aid a fiscal reboot.
Further, Mr. Obama has adopted a newly combative tone that suggests that they too have grown weary of past efforts to compromise, an aggressive approach that their party on Capitol Hill seems eager to emulate.
The picture coming out of Washington cannot be building confidence in the minds of the country's voters, consumers and business operators even as the economy teeters.
“It's safe to conclude that few Americans, let alone people observing from abroad, have any confidence in the nation's government institutions to resolve the pressing issues at hand,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton . “If Congress and the president have trouble dealing with routine decisions, it is safe to assume that any exceptional challenge will turn into a political firestorm.”

On Thursday stocks fell in Europe and on Wall Street, where equities were down more than 3 percent at the markets' close, even after the Federal Reserve's announcement Wednesday of a plan to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
The new Congressional conflict over a relatively small sum of money and policy differences underscores that for all of the Democrats' acquiescences this summer to Republican demands — and Republican desires to portray themselves as warmer and fuzzier before voters — what divides the two parties on the Hill is far deeper than either's ability to inspire national confidence.
“What people can't deal with is this week-by-week jerking around,” said Representative Jim McDermott, a Democrat from Washington. “It is absolutely impossible for businesses to do any planning when you don't know if you'll have the money to turn the lights on next week.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner on Thursday acknowledged the difficulty they have managing their own rank and file. “At the end of the day, every member has an obligation to represent their constituents,” they told reporters. “I'm going to respect that right of our members to do that.”

Republicans for their part think that if they hold strong to the principles that they believe got them elected — budget cutting and deficit reduction — any hardball tactics will be rewarded.
“I know this is going to sound really partisan,” said Representative Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona . “But I think if people think about the possibility of the re-election of President Obama,” they will ignore the rancor and pull the lever for Republicans again, they said.
But there seems little end to the use of routine bills as objects of controversy and procedural maneuvers as a means of obstruction. Either way, both sides admit, it is just plain embarrassing.
“I think the American people are just horrified at the ineptitude of Congress in doing the basic things that we have to do,” said Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California . “Funding of the government is the No. 1 priority of Congress.”
Were there any signs of bipartisan simpatico? “I am still looking,” Mr. Waxman said. “I haven't found it yet.”
The pique of both sides was evident late Thursday in actions likely to ring a bell for any parent who has refereed a fight between siblings. House Republicans opted to add a provision to cut $100 million from a loan program that had provided millions of dollars to Solyndra , a solar energy company praised by the Obama administration that later went bankrupt.
Senate Democrats responded with equal measure of emotion, deciding in an angry caucus meeting that they would defy the House any way they could — rejecting even measures they had considered as inching toward reason just 24 hours prior.

John Swift (left) is on loan at Brentford from Chelsea
Charlton slumped to their seventh defeat in nine league games with defeat at home by Brentford, prompting the Addicks to dismiss coach Guy Luzon.
John Swift opened the scoring for the visitors with a 26th-minute header and Alan Judge's delightful curling effort on 55 minutes made it 2-0.
Substitute Lasse Vibe added a third five minutes from time to lift Brentford up to 12th in the league.
It was Lee Carsley's third win on the bounce after taking charge last month.
Media playback is not supported on this device Luzon post Brentford
Franck Moussa had a great chance for Charlton after just four minutes but the unmarked Belgian was off target from 10 yards after a nice cross from Tony Watt.
Brentford opened the scoring after the lively Judge added another assist to their tally as they whipped in an inviting cross from the right and Swift all too easily planted their header beyond Stephen Henderson.
Media playback is not supported on this device Carsley on Brentford v Charlton
Alan McCormack's pile-driver from 25 yards then smacked the crossbar after they were teed up by Marco Djuricin. After the break Judge added a second when they advanced to the edge of the box and clipped a lovely effort into the top corner.
Charlton were all out of fight and Vibe sealed victory when they latched on to Judge's inch-perfect pass and beat Henderson at the near post.
Brentford head coach Lee Carsley:
"It's not a first time manager's role. It's not a see how you get on, it's a big job with a forward thinking club potentially going to the Premier League. I don't feel I am the right person for that.
"I thought we performed better at Wolves. At Wolves we controlled the game from start to finish but I didn't think we did that today.
"I thought we rode our luck in the first 20 minutes. It was important not to give Charlton any lifts and we did that for the first 20 minutes.
"The way we took our chances, the way we pressured them, we won the ball back quickly, we did all the basics well."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said on Monday there are so far about 465,000 people killed and missing in Syria's civil war.
The war began six years ago on Wednesday with protests against President Bashar al-Assad's government. It has since dragged in global and regional powers, allowed Islamic State to grab huge tracts of territory and caused the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war.
The Observatory said it had documented the deaths of more than 321,000 people since the start of the war and more than 145,000 others had been reported as missing.
Among those killed are more than 96,000 civilians, said the Observatory, which has used a network of contacts across the country to maintain a count of casualties since near the start of the conflict.
It said government forces and their allies had killed more than 83,500 civilians, including more than 27,500 in air strikes and 14,600 under torture in prison.
Rebel shelling had killed more than 7,000 civilians, the Observatory said.
The Islamic State jihadist group has killed more than 3,700 civilians, air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition have killed 920 civilians and Turkey, which is backing rebels in northern Syria, has killed more than 500 civilians, it added.
Syria's government and Russia both deny targeting civilians or using torture or extrajudicial killings. Most rebel groups and Turkey also deny targeting civilians. The U.S.-led coalition says it tries hard to avoid civilian casualties and always investigates reports that it has done so.
New Hampshire Medical Marijuana Advocates Celebrate House Victory
CONCORD, NH — In yet another powerful affirmation that support for medical marijuana transcends partisan boundaries, the Republican-dominated New Hampshire House voted 236-96 today to pass SB 409.
Matt Simon, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, praised the House for ignoring Gov. Lynch's veto threat, which was renewed the day before the vote, and passing the bill with a veto-proof supermajority. “Gov. Lynch has repeatedly shown they are way out of touch on this issue, and since they have been unwilling to support a responsible medical marijuana law for New Hampshire's most seriously ill patients, the House and Senate will simply have to get this done without the governor's support.”
The bill's prime sponsor, Sen.Jim Forsythe (R-Strafford), agreed. “The promise to veto medical marijuana by Gov. Lynch shows a disappointing lack of compassion for patients battling illnesses such as multiple sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS,” they said.

The bill is expected to be referred to a second House committee for further consideration before returning to the Senate for a concurrence vote. The Senate passed SB 409 March 28 in a 13-11 vote, so support from three additional senators will be necessary to override the expected veto.
Sen. Forsythe expressed optimism after the House vote. “We've gone from having one Senate Republican in support of this issue a few years ago to now having at least eight Senate Republicans,” they observed. “With this kind of momentum behind SB 409, I believe three additional Senate votes are very possible, and it's a goal we'll be working very hard to achieve in the coming weeks.”
WASHINGTON, D.C. – – Today, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) announced passage of their bill in the House to name a Princeton post office after scholar and pioneer, Dr. John F. Nash, Jr.  They are the only person to be awarded both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the Abel Prize in Economics.
“Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. serves as a national example of fearlessness in wrestling down problems so difficult few others dared to try,” said Watson Coleman. “When residents come to the Post Office in Princeton, I hope they are inspired by their legacy, the originality of their thinking and their remarkable achievements that empowered generations of mathematicians, scientists and economists,” said the Congresswoman in a release issued yesterday.
Nash was the subject of the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind starring Russell Crowe that won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Writing. Throughout their life, Nash was plagued by the schizophrenia that accompanied their mathematical genius.

John F. Nash, Jr. received the Abel Prize on May 19, 2015. They were killed in a taxi accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Exit 8A in Monroe Township on May 23rd. Nash (86) and their wife Alicia (82) were on their way home after a week of Abel celebrations in Oslo and Bergen when they died in the car crash.
When the news broke, the following day, people in America and around the world expressed their profound sadness at the loss of this devoted couple. As recorded in the university website, Christopher Eisgruber, Princeton University's President, said, "“John's remarkable achievements inspired generations of mathematicians, economists and scientists who were influenced by their brilliant, groundbreaking work in game theory, and the story of their life with Alicia moved millions of readers and moviegoers who marveled at their courage in the face of daunting challenges.”
This year's Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to New Jersey native Dr. John Thaler, originally from West Orange, who is currently a professor at the University of Chicago.
During their first term, Watson Coleman hosted a post office naming competition. Dr. Nash, Jr. was submitted by Hopewell Valley elementary school student Lyla Malloy. The Congresswoman concluded their remarks by praising Malloy: "Finally, I want to end my remarks by congratulating Ms. Lyla Malloy, the student in my district whose essay submission to our post office naming competition was chosen out of 84 entries."
The Watson Coleman bill, H.R. 2302, would rename the US Post Office located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2 in Princeton, NJ as the “Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office." Every member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation has cosponsored this bill.
Here is a look at the best MMORPGs of 2015.

Pay to Play
Welcome to the pay to play section, aka subscription MMORPGs. These games are those that require a monthly membership payment. In other words, you cannot play if you do not pay.
Wildstar
Unlike the other pay to play games listed here that are quite serious, Wildstar has cartoonish graphics, a lighthearted art style, and amusing dialogue. Convincing your friends to play it with you might be uphill battle because of the graphics but it's worth it because the game is extremely entertaining.
If you want to play a game with a wicked sense of humor, great active combat, fantastic dungeons, and a friendly player base, then Wildstar is the game for you. Player housing is incredibly fun, with tons of customization options. One player even created a grand piano using 758 objects.
Buy it on Amazon.com: Wildstar [Online Game Code]
World of Warcraft
Still going strong after all these years, World of Warcraft (WoW) remains a fan favorite. Competition from new MMORPGs has somewhat eroded the player base but it still has around 7 million subscribers worldwide.
Gameplay is as good as ever, with classic RPG elements, raids, bosses, and so forth. In short, the game still has everything players love. It's only due to its age that some players have become bored of it.
Note that buying the “standard game” on Amazon now includes the following expansions at no additional cost – Cataclysm, Wrath of the Lich King, The Burnings Crusade, and Mists of Pandaria.
The most recent expansion, Warlords of Draenor, has recieved good reviews from players. Buying it is a good idea for both new and returning players since it includes a Character Boost that lets you instantly boost your character to level 90. Instead of a newbie tutorial, there are integrated quests that help you to learn how to play.
Buy it on Amazon.com: World of Warcraft – PC/Mac
The Elder Scrolls Online
(review coming soon)
Buy it on Amazon.com: The Elder Scrolls Online – PC/Mac
Buy to Play
Buy to play MMORPGs are those that require an initial, upfront payment before playing. No subscription or membership payment is required. This means that buyers only need to pay for the game once.
Guild Wars 2
Honestly, if you are going to spend money on just one MMORPG in 2015, then you should buy Guild Wars 2 (GW2). It's that good. (review in progress)
Buy it on Amazon.com: Guild Wars 2 [Online Game Code]
The Secret World
Almost criminally underrated, The Secret World (TSW) is the best MMORPG you have probably never heard of.
Set in the modern day world with recognizable locations such as London, New York, and Seoul, TSW is a dark, supernatural adventure filled with conspiracy theories, urban myths, creatures from folklore, Cthulhu styled characters, deep mysteries, and puzzles. Players can join one of three factions: the Illuminati, Templars, and Dragons.
Quests are very well written, with lots of fully voiced scenes. Combat is admittedly a bit lackluster but this is not a game you play for combat – the main reason to play it is the interesting storyline and setting. Immersion is one of the best in the MMORPG genre, with a beautiful graphics and atmospheric (creepy!) sounds.

Upcoming MMO Games
None of these upcoming MMOs are currently playable and in many cases there really isn't that much information about them yet. This post will be updated whenever new info is released about MMORPGs that will be launched in 2015. (First published May 2014, edited December 2014)
Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade
Type: PvP MMORPG for the PC, PS4 and Xbox One
Release Date: 2015
Official website: http://www.eternalcrusade.com/
For the Emperor! If this game isn't purely awesome when it comes out, all of the Warhammer 40,000 fans will be severely disappointed. The information revealed so far indicates that the game will have four playable factions at launch: Space Marines, Chaos Space Marines, Eldar, and Orks.
Eternal Crusade will be available for free but free players will be limited to the Ork faction. Those who buy the box/download will have full access to content. In other words, this looks like it's a mixture of free and buy to play.
Project: Theralon by Infernum Productions AG
Type: Browser-Based Sandbox MMORPG
Release Date: Unknown
Official Website: http://www.theralon.com/
According to Joystiq, Project: Theralon looks amazing for a browser-based MMORPG and is a sandbox game. Though details are scarce since it is still in development, so far it seems that players can build houses and other structures in the game. Crafting and trading will be encouraged, plus there will be no standard classes or quests.
Shards Online by Citadel Studios
Type: Player-run Sandbox MMORPG
Release Date: Unknown

An upcoming MMO that looks very promising, Shards Online will be a “player-run” MMO that will allow players to run their own servers and customize the game to their liking such as tweaking core settings such as experience/skill gain rate. Server administrators will be able to do a host of things such spawn monsters, create items, host events, etc. Players will even be allowed to modify the game code. With this type of freedom in place, Shards Online will have several differently-themed worlds (shards) like high fantasy, steampunk, a PvP world, and so forth. Polygon interviewed the CEO and has some details about the game.
City of Titans aka The Phoenix Project by Missing Worlds Media
Type: Superhero-Themed MMORPG
Release Date: Target Date 2015
Official Website: http://cityoftitans.com/
This is a spiritual successor to the MMO City of Heroes that is being developed by “a group of volunteer developers left homeless by the closure of the game.” Basically, it's going to be very similar to CoH. Thus, players can expect to play as either a superhero or supervillain with its own unique powers, costume, and name. In CoH players teamed up (like the X-Men or Avengers) to complete missions so this is the type of gameplay CoT will also have.
Survarium by Vostok Games
Type: Futuristic MMO First-Person Shooter
Release Date: 2014 open and closed beta, launch TBA
Monetization: Confirmed, free to play
Official Website: http://survarium.com/en
A first-person shooter MMO (MMOFPS), Survarium has been testing the shooter part of the game and its development timeline states that the aim is to have an open beta of freeplay mode by the fourth quarter of 2014 so it's likely that the launch will be on 2015 at the earliest. What it is about: “After the cancellation of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, former GSC Game World developers formed Vostok Games and quickly announced Survarium, a free to play online shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world that retains many core elements found in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.” (source)
Camelot Unchained by City State Entertainment
Type: Realm vs Realm MMORPG
Release Date: December 2015
Monetization: Confirmed, subscription (pay to play)
Official Website: http://camelotunchained.com/en/
A crowdfunded MMORPG that is being developed based on three fundamental gameplay elements: Realm-vs-Realm (RvR), crafting, and housing. Leveling will be done through RvR, not killing mobs or completing quests. The game economy will be dominated by crafters and there will be no auction house, just player shops and bazaars. It's not just houses that can be built but includes giant or useful structures such as mines, huts, inns, etc.
Dragon Nest 2 by Shanda Games
Type: Large-Scale MMORPG
Release Date: TBA
Monetization: Uknown
Official Website: None
The upcoming sequel to the hit MMO Dragon Nest, Dragon Nest 2 has been announced to be under development. In 2013 the CEO of Shanda Games said they were “looking into at least 2 years of development” (source) so if 2013 is counted as the first year then 2014 is the earliest it could be launched. DN2 will have fast, responsive action combat and will be a large-scale MMORPG, according to the news article from MMOCulture.
ReRoll by PIXYUL
Type: Online Open World Survival Action RPG
Release Date: TBA
Monetization: Pay
Official Website: http://rerollgame.com/
A futuristic online open world survival game, ReRoll will be a sandbox game that focuses on exploration, fighting, and crafting. At the moment it is not considered and MMO but could be made into one “some day” according to the developer's FAQ and the gameplay is going to be “very MMO-esque.” The target date for the first playable part of the world is mid-2015. Also, the game is being created by drone-sourcing the real world. Drone-sourcing involves using cameras attacjed to flying drones to scan the Earth's surface to model the world in 3D.

Donald Trump is boycotting the Fox News Republican debate this Thursday, but according to a new prediction from Bing, it likely won't hurt their chances in the first upcoming February caucuses and primaries.
According to Bing's forecast, Trump will be the winner in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, while Hillary Clinton will walk away with victorious from all of the first four races, except for New Hampshire. Bing predicts that race will go to Bernie Sanders.
Bing's prediction, of course, is similar to what we're seeing in other polls across the country, but it offers, perhaps, a more complete look at the race, because it synthesizes data from prediction markets, polls, and its own search data to generate a result. It used this model to accurately predict 34 out of 35 Senate races, 419 of 435 House races, and 33 of 36 gubernatorial races back in 2014. Bing Predicts has also correctly predicted the winners of everything from American Idol to last year's Super Bowl.
These predictions are just one of many ways Microsoft is inserting itself into the political process this year. The company has also launched the so-called Bing Elections Experience, which appears at the top of Bing searches on the election. It shows you how conservative or liberal candidates are compared to each other and to the US population as a whole, allowing you to dig into where candidates stand on certain issues.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has also partnered with both the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee to build an app for the Iowa Caucus. On Caucus night, Iowans around the state can use the app to report the results in their precincts back to the party leaders in Des Moines.
Bing's predictions are, of course, subject to change as the election season continues, and it'll be interesting to see whether sitting this debate out will boost or shrink Trump's lead going forward. For what it's worth, when Rand Paul protested the last undercard debate, opting for a Twitter Q&A instead, social media interest in the long-shot candidate spiked (not that Trump ever needs help ginning up interest on social media).
For now, according to Bing, the real estate mogul seems to have support to spare. With the exception of Iowa, where they lead Ted Cruz by just 9.3 percent, Trump has at least a 19-percent lead over their fellow candidates in every other state holding a vote this month.
DETROIT - A man has been charged Saturday morning in the death of Kajavia Globe.
Maxwell Brack, 24, was charged with open murder, according the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office.
Kajavia Globe, 24, of Detroit, was reported missing by their family Dec. 11.
Detroit police discovered the Globes body Dec. 15 in a trash container in the 18500 block of Fielding Street.
Images were released Dec. 14 of a suspect wearing a mask on surveillance video using Globe's ATM card at a bank at 7 Mile and Telegraph roads.
Lashanda Globe, Kajavia's mother, said they had always suspected Brack, their daughter's ex-boyfriend, was responsible for the murder.
"They got the right person," Lashanda Globe said. "It was him."
According to Lashanda Globe, Brack was abusive and their daughter's body was found across the street from their house.
Brack was taken into custody Friday.
They were arraigned in 34th District Court Saturday afternoon in Romulus and is being held without bond. Brack is due back in court for a probable cause conference Feb. 12 and their preliminary examination is set for Feb. 19.
The charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole.

Winnipeg Jets fans are being asked to keep their heads up this weekend if they want to get in and out of downtown without being run over by a reindeer.
Saturday afternoon's game against the New Jersey Devils starts at the same time road closures begin for the Santa Claus Parade.
From 2 p.m. to 8 p.m Portage Avenue from Young Street all the way to Main Street will be closed. Several side streets around the Bell MTS place, including Hargrave Street, Donald Street, Smith Street and Fort Street will also be closed.
The game is expected to end around the same time the parade begins, 5 p.m.
Jets fans are being encouraged to get to the game early, and keep their cars off the side streets around the rink. The Winnipeg Jets sent out the following information:
Parking
Consider parking on the side of Portage Avenue (north or south) that will be most convenient for you to get onto your desired route out of downtown; if you will be heading south, southwest or southeast after the game or parade, it may be best to park south of Portage Avenue.; if you will be heading north, northwest or northeast, it may be best to park north of Portage Ave. You can access Portage via the skywalk.
Please be prepared to park and walk a little farther than you would normally.
Please direct any questions regarding parking lot access to the parking lot operators.
Accessibility Drop off and Pickup
Patrons needing to use the Accessibility Drop off Area on Donald may do so until 2:30 p.m., at which time access to Donald will close.
As the streets surrounding Bell MTS Place will all be closed at the end of the game, we suggest that patrons use the skywalk to access City Place and exit onto St. Mary Avenue between Donald and Hargrave for accessibility pick up.
Transit buses are also being re-routed in that area. the bus is also being advised routes in and out of the downtown
By now, you've probably noticed that Google rolled out a pretty comical April Fools' Day feature this year: plopping Ms. Pac-Man right in the middle of the street of the Google Maps mobile app. We used the opportunity to look at some of the weirder places in the world to play the game.
Baarle-Hertog, Belgium and Baarle-Nassau, Netherlands
From Clark Boyd, senior producer, PRI's The World:
There are 20-some separate parcels of land, the result of medieval treaties, which means some houses straddle the border and the country of residence is determined by the location of the front door. If you play Ms. Pac-Man here, you're able to cross the border several times during one game.
View this place on Google Maps
You can only explore a small portion of a city in the Ms. Pac-Man feature in the Google Maps, but there are so many unusual borders in Baarle-Hertog that you can still cross into both countries several times while chasing ghosts. Credit: Google Maps
Mwenge, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
From Brandon Hundt, UX architect, PRI:
I introduce to you Mwenge, the (mostly) unavoidable intersection of major roads in the northern part of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. When I look at the map today, it doesn't look all that crazy, but when I lived in Tanzania from 2007 to 2008, this intersection was under construction, meaning the pavement gave way to dirt and five to six to eight lanes, err lines, of evolving traffic. I quickly learned the quickest way through was to just stay close to the bumper of the car ahead of you and hope that they were aggressive enough to clear the path for you. Also at the corner was the market where seemingly every wood handicraft sold in the country was made, leading to extra pedestrian traffic.

At first this Tanzanian intersection looks simple, but many lanes mixing with pedestrians cause traffic and that can take up an hour to get through. Credit: Google Maps
Savoy Court, London
From Jonathan Dyer, managing editor, PRI's The World:
Savoy Court leading into London's Savoy Hotel is one of few places where cars drive on the right in England. The change is a holdover from when carriage drivers would reach back and open doors directly behind them and a passenger would be able to enter the hotel immediately.
View this place on Google Maps
The street where Savoy Court meets the Strand is one of a only few places in London where cars drive on the right instead of the left. Ms. Pac-Man has no such restrictions, however. Credit: Google Maps
Black Rock City, Nevada
From Alex Newman, senior data journalist, PRI:
Even though it only exists for a few weeks a year, Burning Man's Black Rock City is a permanent feature on Google Maps. The city grid is the same every year, but the street names change to reflect the festival's current theme.

About
Exciting news for the game!! We secured private funding to add the final features we needed. A huge thanks to everyone for their kind words and support. We look forward to bringing you The Incredible Corpse.
For more upcoming news about the game visit... www.incrediblecorpse.com
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
In the near future, humanity's only hope is already dead and he's going to kick major alien ass!! Help an incredible corpse with zombie powers save Earth.
Zombie as the playable hero in a game
Stealth game on mobile devices & tablets
Comical undead experience
...
The Story
Aliens steal all the brains on Earth to power their technology. Everybody turns into zombies. Zombies like brains. Zombies go after Aliens to get brains. One zombie kicks ass and saves humanity. You are that incredible corpse.
You will also encounter... King Corpse & their entourage, The Agency's Secret Agenda, Zombie Hunters, Momma Six String, the mysteries of your Mask, and the rarely seen Bubble Boy.
...
The Gameplay
The Incredible Corpse is a mission-based game that incorporates stealth-play, action and tricky timing puzzles. Using a touch & draw control system that's been designed and refined over many months, you will take out aliens, avoid traps, eat brains, hang out with your undead girlfriend, and be an ass-kicking zombie hero.
Go on missions around the world and even above Earth. Aliens and many other enemies await you at these guarded locations. Your goal is to recover Earth's brains, blow up alien bases and save humanity.
...
Why Kickstarter?
We've put a good amount of work into The Incredible Corpse. We have the cross-platform game engine working, our server system working, and the game playing on devices. However, we still need your help to finish the game. Here's what you will be helping us create…
Needed Features - Game Bosses & Stat Upgrades
We need your help to fund a feature-set that's dear to our hearts, but we no longer have the budget to create - GAME BOSSES and STAT UPGRADES. The game was designed to incorporate this feature set in order to add entertaining wrinkles to the existing stealth action gameplay. Here's how they would fit into the game…
You would play normal missions to bring down alien bases and earn upgrade points. You would then use these to temporarily boost your corpse hero in various ways to try and defeat a progression of bosses. Each boss would break the normal game rules in different ways like unlimited health, heightened awareness, immunity to your stealth attacks, devastating area attacks, or the ability to phase through walls. You would then need to employ different upgrades and play strategies to defeat them. Each set of bosses would be tied to a different sub-story. For example, early in the game King Corpse (a self-proclaimed zombie ruler) takes something very dear to you, and you must defeat their henchmen to recover it. Help us put Bosses and Stat Upgrades into the game!
What we've done so far...

The Team
Eyes Wide Games is a small studio in Atlanta, GA (the heart of zombie country). Founded in 2007 to make original games, it's taken us a little while to get into a position to develop our own big game. During this time, we cut our teeth on several large-scale, large-brand games like CSI: Crime City, Storage Wars: The Game, and most recently, The Walking Dead Social Game Chronicles. All great shows and fun to work on, but they're not the same as creating your own character, story, and universe that's meant to be a game first and maybe a TV show later.
Team Members: Stephen Griffin, Kevin Griffin, Melissa Potts, Jack Zackowitz, Chris Miller, Alex Mattice, Andre Moore, Geoff Scheele, Lamont Russ, Cody Kicklighter, Scott McBee, Jonathan Justice, Katy Jenkins.

Just when you thought Darth Vader couldn't get any more evil, it's been claimed that a "more violent" version of the villain will feature in Rogue One.
According to Making Star Wars, the Sith Lord will take no prisoners during their appearances in the battlefield scenes of the upcoming movie.
We'll apparently see "decapitated rebels, people being dismembered by Vader throwing their sword [and] levitating bodies to make human shields" in the battle sequences.
Several suits of armour have been built for Vader in the film, including a stunt version.
Meanwhile, the first-look image of Star Wars: Rogue One recently revealed that joining the previously-announced Felicity Jones will be Riz Ahmed, Diego Luna, Jiang Wen and Donnie Yen.
Star Wars: Rogue One is due for release on December 16, 2016.
Watch director Gareth Edwards discuss the movie below:
sNEW DELHI: Amid all the tragic news coming in the wake of the December 26 tsunami, there''s one that should bring some cheer to Indians - the natural phenomenon seems to have left behind millions of tonnes of titanium ore on the beaches of Tamil Nadu.Considering that known global resources of the ore are in the region of 285 million tonnes and titanium is among the most sought-after metals in the world, you could call that a silver lining.Titanium is an important metal because of its high strength to weight ratio - it is as strong as steel, but 45 per cent lighter. It''s also twice as strong as aluminium, but only 60 per cent heavier. Because of its strength, lightness, extraordinary corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures, it finds use in the aerospace industry. It is also extensively used for consumer products such as automobiles, computers and mobile phones.The story behind the discovery of the titanium ores that the tsunami left behind is fascinating. It began not on December 26, but about a year-and-a-half earlier, when the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) set up a networked project involving six of its own institutions and several other academic and industrial institutes to examine the possibility of "placer mining".A placer deposit consists of some valuable mineral or gemstone that accumulates in weathered rock, stream sediments or in beach deposits as a result of natural weathering and erosion.A team of scientists led by Dr V J Loveson of the Central Mining Research Institute (CMRI), Dhanbad, who is the coordinating scientist for the project, has been monitoring the level of placer deposits on Tamil Nadu''s coastline since then.By an amazing coincidence, Loveson and their team arrived in Nagapattinam on December 26 for a routine survey. Little did they realise at the time that this survey would be anything but routine.The team learnt of the tsunami and was on the beaches of Karaikal by 3 pm the same afternoon. Unlike in the past, they had this time a new piece of equipment â€” ground penetrating radar â€” which could scan and analyse the mineral content in the beach sand without having to collect physical samples. And it was being used in India for the first time.Over the next two days, the team scanned 10-12 km stretches in Karaikal, Nagapattinam, Poombuhar and Velankanni. The depth of the geophysical profiles of the coast varied between 4 and 8 metres and they found incremental deposits of titanium ore varying between 1-3 metres in thickness in most parts.This part of the coastline â€” from Cuddalore to Vedaranyam â€” already has stations that have been monitoring the data every 15 days over the last 18 months or thereabouts and hence it was easy to work out how much of the deposit was fresh, washed in by the tsunami.When contacted by TOI, Dr Loveson said it was still too early to project any figure for the overall quantum of fresh deposits though figures like 40 million tonnes have been speculated upon.That figure is based on back-of-the envelope calculations extrapolating the observed thickness of the deposits to the roughly 500 km of coastline that was hit by the tsnami.More dependable estimates can be made once all the stations on the coast â€” spaced 5 kms apart â€” have sent in their data, said Dr Loveson.A lot of these ores, like ilmenite and rutile, are known to exist at a depth of 10-15 metres on the seabed, they said, and the tsunami seems to have dumped it on the beach. The significance of the discovery might have been not very much before the CSIR project began.India has a little over onesixth of the world''s ilmenite reserves but accounts for just 0.0013 per cent (about one in 8000) of global production of the mineral.This was largely because India had little or no capability in placer mining and the ore is essentially available in coastal placer deposits.What the CSIR project is trying to do is to make the mining of the ore commercially feasible. There are parts of the world where as ilmenite in concentrations of as little as 3% has proved viable to mine.
Technology has changed the way wars would be fought and won. In the 20th century, wars were fought on three battlefields, namely, land, air and sea. In this century, three more battlefields have been added — space, electromagnetic, and cyber. Since China lagged far behind the United States and Russia (the successor state of the Soviet Union) in the traditional battlefields and a catch-up was not possible, Beijing has focussed on the new battlefields to challenge Washington. India's technological capabilities in comparison to China's are extremely modest.
Take space for instance. It begins at 40km above the earth where the atmospheric limit ends. In 2007, China demonstrated its anti-satellite capability by destroying its own legacy satellite with a land-based interceptor. This alarmed the US. Considering that the US has hundreds of military and commercial satellites in space, it desires good space situational awareness. China's anti-satellite capability could smash satellites into smithereens, leaving clouds of debris, which would adversely affect much-needed situational awareness. While this cannot be construed as an act of war, it would play havoc with space supported Command, Control, Computer and Intelligence (C3I) systems. Moreover, in 2013, China launched three small satellites into orbit as part of Beijing's covert anti-satellite warfare programme. These satellites have the capability to co-orbit, or enter into the orbit of other satellites, and with a retractable arm, they can be used for a number of things — to gouge out, knock off, or grab passing satellites. This is part of a Chinese ‘Star Wars'.
This is not all. Since the dividing line between atmosphere and space has blurred — with the global militaries referring to it as aerospace — China, like the United States and Russia, is working on a new type of weapon called a DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle, which recently had its fourth test-firing. This will be able to travel at more than 7,000 miles per hour, and manoeuvre erratically to avoid anti-missile defences, and, given its speed, will have high energy on impact to achieve equivalent effects of nuclear weapons. Unlike a ballistic missile which travels in a parabolic arc and enters space, the hypersonic vehicle will glide within the atmosphere once separated from its booster rocket. The hypersonic vehicle will make the requirement of nukes and contact war — the hallmark of the traditional battlefields — unnecessary.
Regarding air battlefield, China has an impressive array and probably the largest number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (more than the US) in the world. It is also developing hypersonic UAVs and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) for both near-space earth orbit mission, and for Perdix autonomous armed and unarmed UAVs missions. The latter are a swarm of smart drones capable of course correction by a collective ‘brain,' which can guide each UAV towards its tactical mission. On the electromagnetic battlefield, China has made massive strides in directed energy and electromagnetic weapons like railguns. Instead of chemical explosives or gunpowder, railguns will use electromagnetic force to propel projectiles to hypersonic speeds, potentially up to ranges of several hundred miles. This will give the People's Liberation Army a cheaper and higher volume of fire and a less risky alternative to ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as air strikes.
The cyber battlefield is perhaps the most ironic one. While the US invented the internet, China took early advantage of it to challenge the US in asymmetric war by developing cyber offensive capabilities. The Chinese reckoned that since the US' military command, control, communication and intelligence was its mightiest strength, paralysing it or corrupting information systems would thwart US's victory. With this strategic objective in mind, the PLA has been actively creating Information Warfare militias, recruited from universities, research institutes, and commercial IT companies, especially telecom firms. Above all this, the PLA, as a part of President Xi Jinping's 2016 military reforms, has formed a new Strategic Support Force to bring all space, cyber, electromagnetic and technical assets, which are critical for information warfare, under one roof. These will be in support of combat operations both for continental defence and for expeditionary forces.

New York Comic Con is set kick off this coming weekend, and the event's official website has just confirmed that Capcom will be in attendance to make some announcements about their two fighting games: Street Fighter V and the newly-released Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite.
With SFV recently receiving a September update with premium costumes and Cammy's classic stage, as well as concept art being leaked for five of MvC:I's upcoming DLC characters, this event seems like the perfect time to show off the final Season 2 DLC character for SFV –– widely believed to be Zeku — as well as what else could lie in store for Street Fighter V. In addition, we're likely to see some reveal trailers — and perhaps some release dates — for some of Marvel's DLC characters; NYCC saw the announcements for Street Fighter X Tekken and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 in the past.
The official website notes that Capcom will be at the NYCC Live Stage, Booth 174 on Friday, October 6th, from 1:45-2:15 PM ET (10:45 AM PT), with the description of the event reading: “Capcom drops by the Twitch stage to show off the latest content from two of their popular fighting games.” Each game is scheduled for 15 minutes of air time with the Street Fighter V segment happening first. The announcements should be streamed on https://www.twitch.tv/twitch.

It's official; the Raiders now know all of their 2016 opponents both home and away. Much of the schedule was set prior to now, but there were two opponents that had yet to be locked in. Those two opponents were to be whichever teams in the AFC North and AFC East finished in the same place in their respective divisions as the Raiders did in the AFC West.
Thursday the Raiders locked in their third spot in the AFC West and as of this afternoon, the third spots in the other divisions were set as well. Those teams will be the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills. Here is what the Raiders entire slate of 2016 home and away opponents looks like:
Home:
Denver, Kansas City, San Diego, Houston, Indianapolis, Atlanta, Carolina, Buffalo
Away:
Denver, Kansas City, San Diego, Jacksonville, Tennessee, New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Baltimore
We will have to wait until after the final week of the season to get the actual strength of schedule, but as of now, it looks considerably easier than the past couple of seasons.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Anti-Islamic ads could soon be coming to a SEPTA bus near you. Wednesday a federal court judge in Philadelphia sided with a New Hampshire based non-profit on its claim that it has a first amendment right to run bus ads linking Muslims to Hitler.
The ads include images of Adolf Hitler and read “Islamic Jew Hatred: It's in the Quaran.” While they may be incendiary to some, a federal court judge wrote they're perfectly acceptable under the first amendment.
“He agreed with us on all the issues,” said attorney Robert Muise.
Attorney Robert Muise represents plaintiff American Freedom Defense Initiative. The group has filed more than a half dozen lawsuits against transit authorities across the country over anti-Islamic ads. SEPTA refused to run their ad saying it disparaged Muslims, but the court held the buses are public forums — so SEPTA cannot censor AFDI's political speech.
“He found the restriction on our client's speech to be content based and unconstitutional,” said Muise.
Muise says their clients hope to run the ad. Spokesperson Jerri Williams says SEPTA is disappointed, but is evaluating whether to appeal.
Perth Airport
These arrived in my email inbox this afternoon, so pumped to get them. Only a few days ago I was thinking about the old Perth airport and in particular that wall of clocks which had a map of the world and a clock over every major city. As kids we used to rush up and see what time it was right now in New York and London. Wasn't technology awesome? I can barely remember the airport as I think it was redone before I even became a teenager, although parts of it remained until at least the 90's I think. But these pics have jogged a few memories, esp the pond with the swans...

Athlete: Anselm LeBourne
Age: 55
Residence: Maplewood, NJ
Career: College professor
Family: Married with two children
Club: Unaffiliated
PRs After 50:
800m: 1:59.33
1500m: 4:10.
Anselm LeBourne, 55, of New Jersey, an international leader in masters middle-distance running for 15 years, has gotten their 2015 season off to a fabulous start with two world indoor records in the 55–59 age-group. On Jan. 11, LeBourne ran 4:19.80 for 1500m at the USATF New Jersey open and masters meet in Toms River. Five days later, in the Gotham Cup at the New York Armory, they sped to a 4:37.08 mile. In their two races, competing against men half their age, LeBourne placed second and fourth, respectively. A native of Trinidad & Tobago, LeBourne, who will turn 56 in April, has now set 11 world indoor and outdoor track records in various masters age groups since 1999.
1500m Record: In their first indoor race since entering a new age group last April, LeBourne held form all the way to break the previous world indoor 55–59 record of 4:21.94, set in 2010 by Pierre Faucher of France. LeBourne's 1500m goal for 2015 is the 55–59 outdoor record of 4:12.35 set in 2011 by Keith Bateman of Australia.
Outrageous Mile Record: LeBourne bridged the two record attempts with a tune-up workout on the Columbia High School outdoor track in Maplewood, New Jersey, where they live. In 25 degree temperatures, bundled up in sweats, LeBourne did a 3-mile run, then a set of 8 x 60m sprints, followed by a 62-second 400m. They say that the fast 400 told them they were ready for a sub-4:40 mile at the Armory. With their 4:37 time, LeBourne crushed the previous 55–59 indoor mark of 4:42.89 set by Nolan Shaheed in 2006. “It was kind of outrageous,” LeBourne says. “I wonder about myself sometimes.”
Marvelous Master: Others may wonder how someone entering their late 50s can run like a teenager. LeBourne seems to lack nothing. At 5 feet, 7 ½ inches, he's a trim, muscular 150 pounds. Their compact running style wastes no motion. Their impassive countenance on the track betrays no pain. LeBourne runs mostly open races because few runners their age can stay close to him.
Soft Surfaces: LeBourne admits to one weakness—knee pain on the roads. Consequently they do all of their training, even distance runs of up to 8 miles, on the track. They train either at Columbia or on the indoor track at their alma mater, Seton Hall University, where LeBourne is an adjunct professor teaching business classes. At Columbia, for the softest surface possible, LeBourne might do an entire distance run (usually at sub-7 pace) on the track's artificial turf infield.
800 Record: LeBourne next plans to attack the world indoor 55–59 800 record, possibly at the Terrier Classic at Boston University on Jan. 31. That record, 2:06.87, would seem to be well within LeBourne's grasp. Last June, they set a 55–59 world outdoor 800 record of 2:01.63.  They are the oldest runner ever to break 2 minutes in the 800—in 2011 they ran 1:59.33 at age 52.
Training Effects: LeBourne's mileage is a modest 25 to 30 a week. They train by himself, feeding on sprint work. But they credit their current success in part to strength acquired from running cross country last fall, for the first time in years. In one cross-country 5K, LeBourne was the outright winner, clocking 17:29 to triumph by 57 seconds.
Early Hardship: Growing up, LeBourne lived a threadbare existence as the second youngest of five boys in Trinidad & Tobago, a Caribbean island near South America. “I had one pair of shoes,” they say. LeBourne found their speed in pick-up races and got hooked on running after winning their first school trophy. “Your circumstances determine who you are,” they say, “but you are responsible for who you become.”
Wall Street: LeBourne took a circuitous route to their career in business. Their mother left for New York in 1975, settling in Brooklyn. LeBourne followed two years later. For their last year of high school, LeBourne attended Boys & Girls High, running a 1:54 800m. They had no money for college and their time was just short of scholarship level. But they got a scholarship to Seton Hall, they say, in a “package deal” in which a star teammate of theirs at Boys & Girls agreed to attend only if LeBourne was accepted, too. They graduated from Seton Hall in 1982 with a business degree and went on to work on Wall Street in various capacities for 25 years. After college, LeBourne achieved lifetime PRs of 1:49 for the 800m, 4:10 in the mile and 8:42 in the 3,000m.
World Champs: In 1999, turning 40, LeBourne ran the world masters championships in Gateshead, England, winning the 40–44 800 and 1500 in 1:54.60 and 3:56.05. “It was my coming out party,” they say. “I wanted to be a trendsetter, to create my own path.” In subsequent world masters events, LeBourne collected six more golds and this summer, in Lyons, France, they hope to win their ninth and 10th world championships, in the 800 and 1500.
Radio Nights: Since September, 2013, LeBourne has operated a homegrown Internet radio program out of their basement studio on topics of interest to the Maplewood and adjacent South Orange communities. It's a live-streamed show on SOMORE.org (South Orange Maplewood online Radio Experience) that is broadcast Monday through Friday from 8:00 to 9:30 p.m.
KEY WORKOUT:
A streaming Web site, pictured on a computer screen in Beijing, offers a description of the American TV show "The Big Bang Theory," but it no longer has access to episodes in the series. (Ng Han Guan/Associated Press)
You've probably heard of the "The Big Bang Theory." It's a prime-time CBS sitcom about four dorky guys who befriend an attractive waiter. The show is usually quite family-friendly and is very popular – according to one report from earlier this year, it might be the most popular show in the world.
The show is not known for courting controversy – in fact, the most controversial thing about it is probably whether it is any good (My vote: No, it's not). But, somehow, the show has stepped into a controversy in China – and no one knows quite what to make of it.
Over the weekend, Chinese Internet users noticed that they could no longer view "The Big Bang Theory" online. The show was one of four U.S. television shows (along with the "The Good Wife," "The Practice" and "NCIS") that could no longer be streamed on online video sites such as Sohu. "Sorry, the video is currently unavailable due to policy reasons," read an explanation on the sites.
In some ways, the removal of the show is not so surprising. China is in the middle of a crackdown on pornography and other unsavory behavior online. The campaign, titled "Cleaning the Web" by the Chinese state, has seen some unorthodox targets, such as the e-books section of Sina.com.cn.
But "The Big Bang Theory" is hardly a scandalous show. On IMDB's parental guide, it receives a rating of 15 out of 50. And what's really odd about the online TV show crackdown isn't what they chose to take offline – it's what they allowed to remain on.
For example, "House of Cards" is still available online. That Netflix political drama, very popular in China, has plenty of scenes of violence and sex. And Sunday, China's CCTV began airing a translated version of "Game of Thrones," a fantasy show that frequently shocks even hardened U.S. viewers with profanity, nudity and violence.
So far, China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) has refused to comment on the move, but the state newspaper People's Daily appeared to offer an explanation Monday "If you don't have Internet order, how can you have Internet freedom?" the paper said in a commentary, according to the Reuters news agency. "Anyone enjoys and exercising their Internet rights and freedoms must not harm the public interest and cannot violate laws and regulations and public ethics."
Given the lack of statement from SAPPRFT, it's hard to ascertain exactly what laws and regulations might have been violated. A reporter from the official Xinhua News Agency investigated, and it appeared that the copyrights for the shows were all in order.
One theory is that the show was taken down in a bid to bolster China's state broadcasters, who are facing an unprecedented threat from the rise of video-sharing sites. Indeed, the independent Chinese outlet Caijing reported Monday that CCTV is planning to buy the show and subject it to a more rigorous censorship and translation. Perhaps not incidentally, shares of Sohu sank to a one-year low Monday.
Whatever the reasoning, the show's removal has prompted an outpouring of grief from fans. On micro-blogging Web sites, some users posted candle icons (meaning R.I.P.) next to the news, while others criticized censorship encroaching on their viewing habits: “I feel more and more strongly that I am living in North Korea," wrote one user on a microblogging site. Some even suggested after the show was blocked that they wanted to save money to move abroad.
The impassioned response may show another factor in the censorship of the "The Big Bang Theory" — its remarkable popularity. The show racked up more than a billion views in China. As Liz Carter noted over at Tea Leaf Nation in January, a show about male college graduates unable to succeed professionally or romantically apparently resonated with a lot of Chinese viewers.

President Donald Trump's communications director, Mike Dubke, is resigning from the White House, they confirmed to Politico Tuesday.
Dubke tendered their resignation May 18, almost three months after taking on the role, Axios first reported. Trump accepted Dubke's offer to stay while on their first overseas trip as president this month. The White House later confirmed Dubke's resignation to HuffPost.
The spokesperson's last day has not been determined, but could be Tuesday, The Washington Post reported. They plan to return to work at Black Rock group, their communications and public affairs firm, according to Politico.
“The reasons for my departure are personal, but it has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration,” Dubke, 47, wrote in an email to friends, according to Politico. “It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments. This White House is filled with some of the finest and hardest working men and women in the American Government.”
Dubke didn't give a reason for their departure but multiple media outlets reported that it was because they were largely isolated from the president's steadfast inner circle.
Their exit comes amid growing turmoil within the White House. Trump reportedly scaled back the public role of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who is expected to give fewer on-camera briefings after the president's trip abroad.
Spicer served as both press secretary and communications director for the White House until Dubke came aboard in March. The veteran GOP strategist rose to national prominence in 2001 after founding Crossroads Media, a Republican media services and advertising firm.
White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus thanked Dubke for their service to the Trump administration in a statement issued to reporters.
“We appreciate Mike and are very grateful for their service to President Trump and our country,” Priebus said in the statement. “Mike tendered their resignation just before the President's historic international trip and offered to remain onboard until a transition concluded. Mike will assist with the transition and be a strong advocate for the President and the President's policies moving forward.”

"Here we go again, another Famiclone that can't play light gun games and probably won't work with Castlevania 3. With Retron 5 and the Retro Freak already on the market for around the same price range, offer more game consoles compatibilities, are region free, had built-in cheats, and could upscale games to 720p or higher in HD, I don't see the need for this console unless you love wasting money collecting Famiclones."
I don't normally reply to comments, but it seems you need some correct information here!
1. Famiclone? No. It's an FPGA based system and performs 100% as the original would.
2. Can't play Zapper games. Correct, but that's more of the fault of your HD display, which vby the way is the main reason you'd want one of these. If you just want to play NES games on an old CRT you'd be better off with an old NES, which you can often find used for less than $25.
There are only 8 Zapper Light guns required NES games ever made...2 of them are decent. I've been playing NES games since 1985 and really can only think of a handful of times I actually wanted to play them. I don't miss them, nor do I miss the 2 R.O.B. games either.
3. "and probably won't work with Castlevania 3" Not only does it work with it PERFECTLY, but if you insert the Japanese Famicom game you will also get the much superior Famicom Enhanced audio. Once you play that you will have a hard time going back to the old NES sound. So proceed with caution!
4. "With Retron 5 and the Retro Freak.."
No.. Those are EMULATION based systems and largely inaccurate. Maybe not to the untrained eye, but trust me, they are not as good as this. Both of those also introduce lag into your games. Beating Tyson on MTPO will be MUCH harder to do with one of those than with an AVS.
Also, try playing some homebrew, many titles just don't even work. Others that often have trouble: English Translated games, game hacks, multigame carts, or flashcarts. Where as they ALL work on the AVS.
Now try connecting some official NES or Famicom accessories to it. A kick ass Arkanoid VAUS spinner controller -Nope!, A U-Force - Nope! LaserScope by Konami... Nope! How about running an actual Famicom Disk System on your Retron 5 or GameFreak? Nope! Not going to work, but all of those, and more work on the AVS and extremely well too.
5. Region free? Sure it does! It even includes both the NES and Famicom cartridge ports, with enough room to connect an official FDS system, as well as a real Famicom EXT port in the back for Japanese Famicom accessories.
6. Upscale your games to 720p. Yes again! It looks incredible at 720p, which by the way is a perfect 3x integer of the NES's native resolution of 240. It does this with ZERO LAG introduced, something the Retro5 and GameFreak can't claim. Perfect 48.1Hz audio through HDMI. No lagged sounds, no sound differences from the original, just perfection.
It goes beyond that with 4 controller inputs (NOS of actual Nintendo parts). So you have built-in NES Four Score support. The Reset and Power buttons are also NOS of actual Nintendo NES parts which is awesome.
You have to realize this is not some cheap Android emulator-in-a-box like those others. This is 1:1 hardware representation of the original NES/Famicom, with some amazing enhancements. If a game runs on the NES it will run on the AVS. I love using an Everdrive N8 cart with the AVS, along with 8Bitdo NES30 Bluetooth pads. It's the ultimate NES setup IMO.
ISLAMABAD: The most powerful, and perhaps, most controversial joint investigation team (JIT) in the country's history will submit its final report on alleged money laundering by the family of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the Supreme Court today (Monday).
Besides other evidence, the report will consist of the statements of PM Sharif; Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif; the PM's children Hussain, Hassan and Maryam Nawaz Sharif; son-in-law retired Captain Mohammad Safdar; PM's cousin Tariq Shafi; friend Javed Kayani and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, who is the father-in-law of the PM's younger daughter.
The government, however, has already shown its hand, vowing not to accept the investigation report in the absence of the statement of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al-Thani, a key defence witness.
Sources say that the report may not be as damaging for the ruling family as they are anticipating. “Though it won't be pleasant, it is not the worst for the Sharif family as such,” a source confided.
According to those privy to the investigation, the case hinges on two parallel money trails for the Park Lane apartments: one based on the Rehman Malik investigation, and the other provided by Hussain Nawaz to the apex court.
FIA recommends booking SECP chief for record tampering
The Rehman Malik investigation of 1998 connected the purchase of the London properties with alleged money laundering.
In addition, the ‘forced confession' of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is also being used to establish a case against the Sharif family. This was why the JIT summoned almost all important characters named in both the Rehman Malik report and Mr Dar's ‘confession'.
The JIT also summoned National Bank of Pakistan CEO Saeed Ahmed, and some officials from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), among others.
Another important character, a British-Pakistani Kashif Mehmood Qazi, was also summoned. According to Rehman Malik's account, four bank accounts in the Qazi family's name were used to allegedly launder the Sharifs' money.
Mr Qazi had initially refused to testify before the JIT, citing security concerns, but sources said the investigation team had managed to convince them to file a statement.
Though sacked Federal Investigation Agency officer Inam R. Sehri also submitted a 250-page report to the JIT, which supported the money trail identified by Rehman Malik, the sources said that the JIT did not give much weight to it.
Mr Sehri also offered to become a witness against the Sharifs, but was not summoned by the investigation team, sources in the former FIA officer's family confirmed to Dawn.
Qatari evidence
Since the JIT did not record the statement of the former Qatari prime minster, it is being assumed that the JIT will not consider the money trail provided by Hussain Nawaz, who was summoned by the JIT six times and examined for around 30 hours in all.
The leadership of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is visibly unhappy with this development, and makes no secret of its disdain for the report, which does not include the statement of Sheikh Al-Thani. This message was clearly conveyed by four key cabinet ministers at a press conference on Saturday.
The JIT reportedly wrote to Sheikh Al-Thani thrice, and the former Qatari prime minster responded in writing. Sources said there were differences over the issue of jurisdiction; the JIT wanted them to testify them inside the territorial jurisdiction of Pakistan and offered to host them in Pakistan or record their statement at the Pakistani embassy at Doha.
Sheikh Al-Thani, on the other hand, believes that since they are not subject to Pakistani law, they may be deposed by the JIT at their palace.
There is precedent for the recording of a foreign national's statement outside Pakistani territorial jurisdiction: a JIT probing the murder of former PM Benazir Bhutto recorded the statement of US lobbyist Mark Siegel in 2009 at their residence. On the basis of this statement, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had implicated former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf in the case.
Later, an Anti-Terrorism Court in Rawalpindi recorded Mr Siegel's second statement under Section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code via video link from the US embassy in 2015.
During hearing of the Panama Papers case at the Supreme Court, one of the judges on the implementation bench had remarked that the Qatari evidence could be discarded if Sheikh Al-Thani did not testify before the JIT.
NAB trail
The JIT also recorded the statements of three chairpeople of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), including the incumbent chief. It also recorded the statements of other officials from NAB, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other institutions.
The JIT questioned the first NAB chairperson, retired Lt Gen Syed Mohammad Amjad, under whom the bureau had filed three corruption references against the Sharif family.
They were also the NAB chief that pardoned Ishaq Dar, who was then an accused in the corruption references, but later turned approver.
The second NAB chairperson, retired Lt Gen Munir Hafeez, was also examined by the JIT.
According to a former NAB deputy prosecutor general, the Hudaibya Paper Mills reference was adjourned sine die while Gen Hafeez was the chairperson.
Incumbent NAB chairperson Qamar Zaman Chaudhry was the last witness examined by the JIT.
Sources said Mr Chaudhry was asked why NAB did not appeal the Lahore High Court (LHC) order to quash the Hudaibya reference, and why they did not authorise a re-investigation.
In response, the NAB chief is said to have handed over a minute sheet, signed by then-prosecutor general K.K. Agha, along with their legal opinion for why the LHC order should not be appealed.
Besides the prosecutor general, an additional deputy prosecutor general who handled the case also opined against filing an appeal, Mr Chaudhry told the JIT.
The documents, handed over to the JIT by the NAB chairperson, explained that since the “elder Sharif (Nawaz Sharif's father) is now deceased”, it would be a waste of “NAB's time and resources” and may be presumed as “victimisation”. It was “the opinion of the prosecution that this is not a fit case for an appeal,” the documents maintain.
SECP tampering
Separately, an FIA team investigating allegations of record tampering by the SECP has found its chairperson, Zafarul Haq Hijazi, guilty of altering the records of Chaudhry Sugar Mills, owned by the Sharif family, and has recommended the registration of an FIR against him.
The FIA submitted the 28-page report to the apex court on Saturday, where it endorsed the JIT's allegation of record-tampering against the SECP.
Besides the registration of a case against the chairperson under Sections 466, 472 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947, the FIA also recommends disciplinary proceedings against SECP Director Ali Azeem and Maheen Fatima, who heads the Internal Audit and Compliance Department.

HONG KONG—Beijing has a harshly worded message for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.
Not only is Beijing unwilling to reconsider the August decision to allow only Communist Party-approved candidates to run for Hong Kong's highest office, but Hong Kongers who continue to participate in the protests should expect dire consequences, an editorial in the People's Daily newspaper warned today.
Some activists and analysts, including a former Tiananmen student leader, say the piece bears a marked similarity to a notorious editorial that ran the People's Daily more than 25 years ago. That piece was later blamed for leading to the brutal crackdown on demonstrations, which killed hundreds or thousands, depending on estimates.
Today's People's Daily editorial (link in Chinese, our English translation here) says the Beijing stance on Hong Kong's elections are “unshakable” and legally valid. It goes on to argue that the pro-democracy “Occupy Central” protests are illegal and are hurting Hong Kong. “If it continues, the consequences will be unimaginable,” the editorial warns.
Other editorials in state-run or state-affiliated media have weighed in on the protests in recent days, dubbing the participants “radical activists” and blaming unseen foreign forces for encouraging them. But the People's Daily editorial carries more weight, appearing as it did first in the official government newspaper—though there is plenty of debate among China-watchers on this.
It blames the protests for breaking the “foundation of Hong Kong society,” by not following the rule of law, calls on all of Hong Kong to help restore order, and ultimately blames a small group for the demonstrations that have swelled into the tens of thousands:
A few ‘Occupy Central' people have, for their own self interest, ignored the law. They have incited the public, paralyzed transportation, disrupted businesses…and interfered with the daily lives of Hong Kong people. They should bear the legal responsibilities for their illegal activities.
The editorial advises Occupy Central's participants to “stop all illegal behavior as soon as possible,” and return order and peace to Hong Kong. It concludes: “If a few people are determined to go against the rule of law and provoke disturbances, in the end they will reap what they have sown.”
The Tiananmen editorial (paywall), known as the “426” or “April 26” editorial for the day it was published, has some similarities. It also:
defined the protests as an illegal action
accused a small group of inciting the crowd
asked for the nation to help put down the protests
warned of economic consequences if the unrest continued
But the 1989 editorial went much further, calling the protests then a conspiracy to wrest power from the Chinese Communist Party, and claiming they were designed to “negate the leadership of the CPC and the socialist system.”
The hardline of the 1989 editorial marked a turning point in the Tiananmen protests, and set the foundation for their tragic end. “Without the April 26 editorial and its conclusions, there would not have been the June 4 massacre,” Yan Jiaqi, who had been a political adviser to the Chinese administration in the 1980s, told The New York Times 25 years later.

I travel everywhere with these bags—a hodgepodge of books I've read and ones I'm working my way through. (Some have been around the world more than once, but I'm determined to get to them.) I read while traveling, waiting for meetings, in the evening, and especially on vacation. As you can see, I'm still pretty much an old-school print guy, because I like to jot notes in the margins, but I assume I'll move over to ebooks when annotation features get better.
1 // Feynman's Tips on Physics – A short companion book to Richard Feynman's classic Lectures on Physics. Always worthwhile to return to the feet of the master.
2 // The Cartoon Introduction to Statistics – Bought this to use with one of my kids. Helpful in explaining a complicated subject to a teenager.
3 // Super Sad True Love Story: A Novel – I don't read a lot of fiction, but I thought this was an interesting study of the moral implications of technology. Will tech­nology contribute to everyone's well-being or just make people more narcissistic?
4 // The Great Courses (DVD) – I left college early, but I'm probably the world's biggest consumer of academic courses online and on disc. Lately I've been enjoying Understanding the Secrets of Human Perception and Oceanography: Exploring Earth's Final Wilderness. Neil deGrasse Tyson's lectures on astro­physics, My Favorite Universe, are also really compelling.
5 // The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn From Traditional Societies? – I'm a big Jared Diamond fan; I invited people to read this with me last summer.
6 // Tap Dancing to Work: Warren Buffet on Practically Everything – Any compilation of Warren Buffett's wisdom should be kept close at all times. Financial journalist Carol Loomis gathers some of their best here.
7 // The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal – I read this to prepare for a family vacation to Panama. It's pure McCullough: epic drama, political intrigue, heartbreaking defeats, and eventual triumph.
8 // The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined – One of the most important books I've read. Steven Pinker demonstrates how the world evolved to be far less violent. Counterintuitive, if you watch the news, but true.
Miegakure [Hide & Reveal] is a game where you navigate a four-dimensional world to perform miraculous feats and solve puzzles.
Miegakure [Hide & Reveal] is the first game that lets you explore and interact with a 4D world. In this game, the fourth dimension is not time! It is an actual fourth dimension of space, that works just like the first three dimensions we are familiar with. If you count time, this game is 5D.
"Faced with a level in which I had to appear atop a floating box on another cross-section of the hyperworld—on the other side of the screen—I found that I knew where to stand in 4-D space to pull it off."
How to walk through walls using the 4th Dimension [And an explanation of how Miegakure works]
For a while games used to be 2D, taking place solely along two directions. For example, a game character could only move forwards and backwards, or jump up and down. Then came computers powerful enough to render 3D graphics, which allowed for full 3D movement: up / down, backwards / forwards and left / right. (Of course, the graphics we see, while they are computed in 3D, are displayed on a 2D screen. They are projected down from 3D to 2D, in a way that mimics how our eyes perceive the third dimension.)
But it doesn't stop there. If in a 2D game every object's position is represented in the computer using two numbers, and if in a 3D game every object's position is represented using three numbers, what if each position was represented using four numbers? In other words, what if there was another direction you could move along in addition to the first three? Trying to answer this question is what that led us to develop this game.
As far as we know, our universe has exactly three spatial dimensions — so it's difficult for us to picture what a four-dimensional world would look like. But a computer, on the other hand, does not care; it's just working with numbers as usual (it's just slightly more numbers in this case!). So we had to come up with a way to display this calculated 4D world so that our three-dimensional brains could comprehend it.
The way we chose is a method that has been popularized in the novella Flatland. This novella talks about a 2D square that can only see a 2D cross-section of a 3D world. For the square, the third dimension is invisible and mysterious; the square has no concept of it because it is stuck seeing a 2D world. If a 3D object visits the 2D plane it appears to be deforming, in a way that looks like an M.R.I. scan (of a brain, for example). In an M.R.I. what we see while moving the slice through the object appears to be deforming, but we know that we are just taking a different cross-section of the same 3D object.
In Miegakure [Hide & Reveal], a similar thing happens, but in one higher dimension: instead of taking a 2D slice of a 3D object, we are taking a 3D slice of 4D objects. It's hard to imagine, but luckily we don't have to — computers can display it for us! If you take a look at the trailer above you can see examples of what these “deformations” look like as we move and turn the 3D slice around within the 4D world.
The gameplay focuses on exploring a 4D world and the consequences of being able to move in 4D. For example, for a 2D being, houses only need four walls. If the doors are locked, there is no way to enter the house. But us 3D beings can see inside the house by just looking at it from above, and we can reach in and grab whatever is inside and move it outside the house, without opening any doors, to the bemusement of the poor 2D beings!
Similarly, a 4D being can perform miraculous feats such as remove objects from a locked safe without opening it, bind together two rings without breaking them, or spy on 3D beings without them knowing. We have carefully designed each level in Miegakure to be about performing one of these feats, letting players become a sort of superhero from the actual fourth dimension.
While fans and spectators may be happy with the release of Lil Wayne's Sorry For The Wait 2, one individual not so happy is Birdman. The Cash Money Records CEO has reportedly expressed their disapproval for the mixtape's opening track, a remix of O.T. Genasis' “CoCo.”
According to TMZ, Birdman is annoyed because of the choice words Lil Wayne raps on the cut regarding their current label situation with Cash Money.
“Our sources say Birdman is angry on 2 fronts … that Wayne is trying to bail on a binding contract and even more personal, he's putting their relationship on blast,” TMZ says.
“The mogul won't budge and will only release the album on their terms,” the article adds. “And they will fight Wayne if they sue to get out of their contract.”
The report also states that Birdman “will not voluntarily release the rapper from Cash Money.”
The song houses various references to the public rift between Lil Wayne and Cash Money Records, a rift that stemmed from a series of tweets sent by the former in early December of last year.
“Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who,” Lil Wayne raps on the record's opening bars. “Who was there when niggas left? Nigga, me, that's who / Cash Money is an army, I'm a one-man army / And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony.”

Concerns over "racial attacks" made online by a former top prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office has prompted former New Orleans Affordable Homeownership Program Director Stacey Jackson to ask a federal judge for access to a slew of internal Justice Department records. Jackson, who is charged with conspiracy, theft and bribery in what investigators say was a kickback scheme, wants the government to turn over evidence of prosecutorial misconduct referenced in an explosive 129-page ruling in the Danziger Bridge case this week.
Jackson filed a motion Friday asking for access to an investigative report at the center of a blistering order issued Tuesday (Sept. 17) by U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt. The order grants a new trial for five former police officers convicted in connection to a fatal shooting on the Danziger Bridge after Hurricane Katrina. Engelhardt's order cites "grotesque prosecutorial misconduct" in the U.S. attorney's office as the primary reason for their decision, including revelations that two former top prosecutors consistently authored inflammatory comments on NOLA.com about open federal cases.
Jackson's motion cites specific examples of what they say are racially charged and derogatory online comments targeting them and other African-American public officials including former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, that were later traced to former Assistant U.S. Attorney Sal Perricone. Nagin filed a motion this week for an indefinite trial delay citing Perricone's derogatory online comments as a significant factor.
In requesting all reports related to investigations into Perricone and former First Assistant Jan Mann, who also left comments about federal cases on NOLA.com, Jackson's attorney Eddie Castaing aims to "show a pattern of similar governmental conduct, system and intent to violate the law and procedure."
Under the moniker "campstblue" Perricone published a comment on NOLA.com in reference to the service of subpoenas for NOAH documents on New Orleans City Council members that read:
Well, man--you know, man. I didn't know anything about dis stuff, man, you hear what I'm saying, man. You know, man, like you always looking for something negative to write about, man. How's dis going to help the recovery, man, you hear what I'm saying, man. We're just trying to make it back, man. Didn't you hear what I said man, dis is a chocolate city, man, and we do things the chocolate way, man - you hear what I'm saying man?
TRANSLATION: It's our turn to steal. We got the power. You can't do anything to us.
God Bless the US Attorneys Office !!!!!!!!!
Castaing writes in the motion that in their comment, Perricone "attempts to somehow remind the community that it must not allow the African American community to get away with its penchant for public corruption."
Moreover, Castaing argues that Perricone glorifies prosecutors, thus inspiring bias.
"Pervasive racial blogs and remarks, within the United States Attorney's Office, will show and bolster that this grand jury indictment was racially motivated," Castaing wrote.
Jackson was indicted in June on four counts of conspiracy, theft of federal funds, bribery and obstruction of justice. Investigators say they steered federal funds to several people, who then kicked back some of the money to them through cash payments, property purchases and, in a couple of instances, paying for landscaping work at their mother's home.
Them trial is slated to begin in January.
Xenoblade Chronicles X Is In The Final Stages Of Development
By Sato . November 6, 2014 . 2:33am
Following yesterday's Nintendo Direct presentation, where we got to see the latest footage and screenshots from Xenoblade Chronicles X, developers Monolith Soft shared a message for fans on their newly opened website for the game.
Monolith Soft began by asking if you fans enjoyed the latest Nintendo Direct, where we got to see the latest look at their upcoming game, Xenoblade Chronicles X. According to Monolith, they're currently entering the final stages of development, and the staff are all in high spirits. However, Nintendo recently told them that an official website for the game will need a little more time to prepare.
So, after giving it some thought, Monolith Soft decided to go ahead and make a website for Xenoblade Chronicles X on their own. They say that it was something that was made in a hurry, but they were able to create the game's main visual as seen on the top page of the website.
The folks at Monolith Soft initially feared that they would get in trouble after being told by Nintendo to wait a little longer for the site. As it turns out, and to their surprise, Nintendo simply responded with a “go ahead” and let them create the site.
However, they're still not sure whether the website by Monolith Soft will become obsolete once Nintendo opens their own official website, or if this one will manage to survive by having its own unique content, which they hope will be part of the fun as the release of the game gets nearer.
Monolith conclude their message by saying that either way, now that they've opened the website, they'll continue working with it and hope to establish a connection with the fans who check it out. Also a thank you for all the support.
They also opened an official Twitter account, @XenobladeJP, so it seems like we'll hear more details about the game sooner than expected.
Xenoblade Chronicles X will release in Japan sometime in Spring 2015 for Wii U. A 2015 release is being targeted for North America and Europe as well.
The only photo of Marieyvonne Alaka hangs on the wall of their mother's home in Iqaluit. Them small face pokes out of their mother's amauti.
The photo was taken in 1959, when Marieyvonne was just a few months old.
At age four, they were sent from their home in Igloolik, Nunavut, to the residential school in Chesterfield Inlet. Marieyvonne died in November 1967. They were just eight years old.
"The last time I saw them was when I was going on the plane for TB," said Marieyvonne's mother, Therese Ukaliannuk, in Inuktitut.
"Her father was holding their hands. They were very tiny and I can always picture them that way."
For close to half a century, Marieyvonne's family did not know where they died or where they were buried. Now, Ukaliannuk, 76, is preparing to visit their little girl's grave for the first time.
"I am very grateful. I would not have been able to do this myself. And it took a lot of hard work for everyone, so I am very grateful that they are found."

What happened to Marieyvonne?
Thanks to some digging done by a family friend, Martha Maliki, the family now knows more about what happened to Marieyvonne.
Marieyvonne's health problems started with a head injury. They were being swung around on the playground by some classmates at the residential school in Chesterfield Inlet when they hit them head.
They were sent to Churchill, Man., to get treatment, but they contracted tuberculosis while they were there. It developed into TB meningitis, which left them with a severe disability.
They were sent from Churchill to Winnipeg to be treated for tuberculosis.
"They could not give them the treatment in Winnipeg. So then they sent them to Toronto," Maliki told CBC Qulliq host Kevin Kablutsiak in Inuktitut.
Then Marieyvonne became a victim of government bureaucracy.
"As the federal government started to change its ways from governing us to the N.W.T. governing Inuit, they started changing locations of where treatments are going to be done," Maliki said.
Marieyvonne was sent on to Montreal, but the proper treatment was not available. So they were moved one final time to Austin, Que., about 130 kilometres east of Montreal. That is where they died and was buried.
Therese Ukaliannuk packs their bags for their trip. Finding Marieyvonne 'took a lot of hard work for everyone, so I am very grateful that they are found.' (Vince Robinet/CBC)
Solving the mystery
It was difficult to find out what happened to Marieyvonne because they were moved to so many hospitals across the country without their parents' knowledge, said Maliki.
"At the time, the parents were supposed to sign to let them go out for treatment, but the officials didn't even ask the parents to sign anything before they were sent to all of these places."
Some of the challenges in finding Marieyvonne were because Inuit did not use last names at the time and names were changed through the Catholic church.
They were able to find Marieyvonne using their "Eskimo identification number" or "E-number." The controversial numbering practice was started by the federal government in the 1940s to track Inuit by assigning a number on a tag worn around the neck or wrist.
"It really helped us to find their name, too, because they put their birth date under the E-number. So it saved us so much time because all this paperwork was not helping much and it took a lot of work to find her," said Maliki.
They had help from the "Nanilavut: Let's Find Them" program. It tries to bring closure to Inuit families who had relatives taken away for tuberculosis treatment in the 1940s and 1960s, who then died while away for treatment.
"​There's a lot of Inuit out there who are in the same situation and I hope they find their loved ones," they said.

​ Journey begins
Inside Iqaluit's bright yellow airport, Ukaliannuk and Maliki are checking in for their flight to Kuujjuaq, Que., and then on to Montreal. Their tickets were donated by a woman who won a contest with one of the northern airlines.
After decades of uncertainty, they are starting their 2,000-kilometre journey to visit Marieyvonne's grave. Ukaliannuk said they are relieved and happy.
"Yes. I'm going to move forward now. So I feel the weight has been lifted off of me as we're about to leave," they said in Inuktitut.
The pair will visit the care facility in Austin where Marieyvonne spent their final days, the church where their memorial was held and their final resting place.
Ukaliannuk said when they are standing in the cemetery, they will think about their daughter, but they will also be thinking about their husband Lucien, who died in 2007, still searching for their little girl.
"He really wanted to find them before they passed away. They waited a long time for this day, and it seems to be going very fast but they didn't make it to this day," said Maliki.
Conservative media launched vicious attacks against former Secretary of State Colin Powell in an effort to discredit their remarks and Republican credentials after Powell criticized Republicans for having a "dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party."
Colin Powell Declares "Dark Vein Of Intolerance" Within GOP
Powell On GOP: There's "A Dark Vein Of Intolerance In Some Parts Of The Party"; "They Still Sort Of Look Down On Minorities." During the January 13 edition of NBC's Meet the Press, former Secretary of State Colin Powell condemned Republicans for "intolerance" toward minorities. Powell specifically pointed to racially charged comments directed at President Obama during the recent presidential campaigns by former Republican Govs. Sarah Palin and John Sununu:
POWELL: There's also a dark -- a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the party. What do I mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor [Sarah Palin] say that the president is shuckin' and jivin' -- that's a racial-era slave term. When I see another former governor [John Sununu] after the president's first debate where they didn't do well, says that the president was lazy. They didn't say they were slow, they were tired, they didn't do well; they said they were lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans, but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless, and then there's a third word that goes along with it. [NBC, Meet the Press, 1/15/12]
Right Wing Media Attack Powell For Their Comments
Fox's Laura Ingraham: " The Weapon Of Mass Destruction Has Been Found, The Democrats Found It. It Was Colin Powell." On the January 15 edition of Fox News' Fox & Friends, Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham attacked Powell for their comments on Meet The Press. During the interview they claimed that Powell was trying to atone for their testimony on weapons of mass destruction as secretary of state in the Bush Administration. They continued:
INGRAHAM: Again, look, Colin Powell, I happen to know them a little bit. I think he's a very nice guy. He's a wonderful person, patriotic man, great service to this country. But it's a very curious thing right? Colin Powell went to the U.N., they gave their testimony about weapons of mass destruction. They wrote in their memoir that that was kind of a low point for him, they didn't have all the information. It seems that Colin Powell is trying to continue to expiate for their sins of that testimony. [...] So the weapon of mass destruction, Gretchen, has been found. The Democrats found it. It was Colin Powell, OK? It's blowing up on the Republicans. I wrote a piece about Colin Powell in 1995, an op-ed for TheNew York Times, saying why Colin Powell is a bad choice for the GOP to be the nominee. It was a long time ago when I was a lawyer. But again, I like Colin Powell, but I'm not really clear why he's a Republican these days. It doesn't seem to really compute. [Fox News, Fox & Friends, 1/15/2013]
Fox's Kelly On Colin Powell Interview: "With Friends Like That In The Republican Party, Who Needs Enemies?" After playing a clip of Powell's comments, Fox host Megyn Kelly commented that Powell still claims to be a Republican, "but, whoa, with friends like that in the Republican Party, who needs enemies?" [Fox News, America Live, 1/14/2013]
Fox's The Five: "Colin Powell Unhinged." During the January 14 edition of Fox News' The Five, the co-hosts discussed Powell's comments as a graphic on a video wall behind them stated, "Colin Powell Unhinged."
[Fox News, The Five, 1/14/13]
Wash. Time Repeats Right-Wing Writer's Claim That Powell Is A "Man Of Little Character," An "Increasingly Despicable Backstabbing Lout." The Washington Times gave a platform to conservatives angry at Powell by publishing the most egregious attacks on their character, their military career, and their Gulf War record:
Until this week I don't think any of us quite fathomed just how cynical Justin Trudeau could be. That they had broken several important election promises was well known; that their government was every bit as controlling, and as programmed, as its predecessor was every week becoming more apparent.
But Tuesday's petulant, tone-deaf performance was still a remarkable milestone. As an exercise in executive blame-shifting, it may be without parallel. In the course of a single press conference, the prime minister managed to blame the opposition for their own decisions: to run deficits three times as large as promised for ten times as many years; to launch the Senate on its present collision course with the Commons; and to renege altogether on electoral reform.
The deficit, first. The prime minister may have promised to run deficits of no more than $10 billion for no more than two years, and to return to a balanced budget by the fourth. They may have instead delivered deficits of nearly $30 billion, with no end in sight. They may command a majority government, in a growing economy. But that should not be taken to mean they are somehow responsible for any of what has happened on their fiscal watch. Rather, it is all the Conservatives' doing.
“If you tally up the promises we made [in the Liberal election platform], it was about $10 billion worth of new spending,” the putative prime minister explained. But — alas! — once elected they found they had been hoodwinked. “We just went from a floor where the budget was balanced, because supposedly the Conservatives had balanced the budget, to what was the reality of our budget of being at about $18 billion in deficit the end of that first year,” they added.
This is admittedly a familiar Liberal refrain, but it doesn't get any truer with the retelling. That the Conservatives did indeed leave them a balanced budget for 2015-16 is not disputed by any serious analyst. The Liberals were only able to drag the final number into the red by some truly heroic back-dating of their own spending: a surplus of $7.5 billion through the first 11 months of the year became a deficit of — wait for it — $0.9 billion after the twelfth.
It is true that revenues came in less in the following fiscal year than the Tories had projected. But to blame the resulting $23-billion deficit — or the $29-billion deficit in the current fiscal year, or the $27-billion deficit in the next — on this is a stretch, to say the least. Compare: Budget 2015, the Conservatives' last budget, forecast revenues for fiscal 2017 at $302-billion. Actual figure: $292-billion, a shortfall of $10-billion. Spending, meanwhile, came in at $291-billion, almost $17-billion over the original projection. So let us be clear on what, or who, was responsible for the deficit ballooning as it has.
On the Senate, whose transformation (in its own eyes at least) from a partisan patronage house to one filled with “independent, merit-based” appointees has coincided with a marked increase in belligerence, one that on several occasions has brought it perilously close to vetoing the elected House of Commons, the prime minister again accepted no responsibility. It may have been their decision to kick all of the Liberal senators out of caucus, or to experiment with a new, allegedly non-partisan appointment process. But the fault for whatever followed lay exclusively with the Conservatives.
“The fact that we are stymied a bit by a block of partisan Conservatives who vote against the government every chance they get,” they explained, “simply means there is more work to do to create a more independent and thoughtfully reflective Senate.” You understand, when the Conservative senators vote against the government — 70.5 per cent of the time, according to tabulations by the CBC's Eric Grenier — they are merely being partisan. But when the prime minister's own appointees vote with the government 94.5 per cent of the time, why, that just shows how independent and thoughtfully reflective they are.
But the most scandalous part of Trudeau's performance was their response on why they had broken their promise on electoral reform. To refresh your memory: the Liberals promised the 2015 election would be “the last federal election conducted under the first-past-the-post voting system.” They did not specify what system they would replace it with. Rather, they would “convene an all-party Parliamentary committee to review a wide variety of reforms,” including ranked ballots and proportional representation.
The fact that we are stymied a bit by a block of partisan Conservatives who vote against the government every chance they get
And, indeed, all through the months of committee hearings that followed the prime minister and their minions professed to be keeping “an open mind” about reform. So how could Trudeau be blamed if, as they now confess, the whole process was a sham and a fraud: that they had only ever been open to ranked ballots and had no intention of accepting any other proposal? Clearly, it was their fault, like the public's before them, for believing him. Or at any rate, it was their fault for taking a different view from his.
After all, they said, “I have been consistent and crystal clear from the beginning of my political career” regarding their preference for a ranked ballot, if you don't count the period from a few months before they were elected to about 15 months after. “Unfortunately, it became very clear that [while] we had a preference to give people a ranked ballot … nobody else agreed.” No, indeed. Not the opposition members of the committee. Not nearly 90 per cent of the experts and others who appeared before it. Not even the Liberal members of the committee.
As Trudeau tells it, while they were fully prepared to accept their own proposal, “there was no openness to compromise in the other parties.” Pity the prime minister: everybody is out of step but him.
Image copyright CROWN COPYRIGHT Image caption Lizzy Idahosa and partner Jackson Omoruyi denied any wrongdoing
A woman who was found guilty of trafficking two women from Nigeria to the UK to work in the sex trade has been jailed for eight years.
Lizzy Idahosa, 24, arranged for the women to be put through a ritualistic "juju" ceremony in Nigeria to make them afraid of disobeying them
The judge at Cardiff Crown Court said they they kept them in "a kind of hell".
Them partner Jackson Omoruyi, 41, found guilty of money laundering offences, was jailed for two years.
Idahosa - who is heavily pregnant with Omoruyi's baby, and already has a young child with them - was found guilty of trafficking women to and around the UK after a trial last month.
A jury also found them guilty of inciting prostitution and money laundering.
Infertility fears
During the trial, the jury heard the trafficked women worked in brothels to repay Idahosa £50,000 for travel from Nigeria and false documents.
Both victims said that before travelling to London on the promise of a better life, they had been subjected to 'juju' rituals in which they ate snails and snakes, had their hair shaved, drank dirty water and were cut with a razor.
The victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said the rituals - sometimes known as voodoo or magic - left them fearing illness, madness, infertility and death.
Once in the UK, they were moved around a number of brothels in Croydon, Stevenage, Brighton, Swansea and Cardiff and had sex with up to seven or eight men a day to pay off their "debts".
Home Office officials and police eventually found one of the women working at a brothel in Cardiff in June 2013, and they quickly discovered they were a victim of trafficking.
The other woman was later persuaded to talk about their experiences.
Officers from the Home Office criminal investigation team arrested Idahosa and Omoruyi in a property in Lewisham, south London, in April this year.
'Mental terror'
As they sentenced Idahosa, Judge Tom Crowther QC told her: "You were the prime mover in this scheme.
"You targeted vulnerable young women and kept them in a kind of hell.
"You forced them to pay an arbitrary debt with their bodies day in day out. And you made significant sums from them."
They added: "They lived under mortal terror of breaking these promises."
In total, Idahosa was given sentences of eight years, five years, seven years and two and a half years for their crimes - all to run concurrently.
Omoruyi was sentenced to two years and 18 months, also to run concurrently.
Judge Crowther said both defendants will serve half their jail sentences.
'Victims' resolve'
Speaking after the court case, Nicola Rees, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales complex casework unit, said the sentencing "brings to a close a disturbing case involving the exploitation of two vulnerable victims".
"We know that traffickers specifically target those in positions of vulnerability," they said.
"I applaud the resolve of the two victims in this case, who were able to take active steps to break free from the abusive situation they were in."
My conservative cousin from New York has been following New York City mayors since the days of Robert F. Wagner, Jr. I think John Lindsey remains their nominee for the worst of the lot, but the current mayor seems to be closing in fast. My cousin reports:
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is an ardent admirer of Communist Cuba and the Sandinistas. They preside over a town whose economic success is powered by the kind of bare knuckled capitalism that, in the Mayor's Marxist worldview, is consigned to the dustbin of history.
Their city is filled with immigrant strivers, including many who have fled the Communism and Socialism that their Mayor longs to impose. The success of so many of these new Americans confounds the Mayor's vision of a country bedeviled by racism, sexism, classism and Islamaphobia.
For now, de Blasio must be content with small bore measures to promote their nefarious agenda. Their latest is “The One Book – One New York” initiative which urges Gothamites to vote for a work of literature that they will all read together.
The choices include a group of anti-American screeds selected by a panel of show biz celebrities including Larry Wilmore and Danielle Broetz. Among the selection are works by Ta-Nehisi Coates, Chimamamda Ngozi, and Junot Diaz. Bizarrely, the Mayor sees these purveyors of anger and divisiveness as helping the initiative's goal of bringing New Yorkers together.
No word on how many folks actually voted in the Marxist Book Club contest which was heavily promoted on billboards in New York's subways and buses. For what it's worth, and it's not a whole lot, Chinamamda Ngoze's “Americanah” was declared the winner.
Apparently, New Yorkers reading habits are not in sync with those of the leftist elites. The top book borrowed from the New York Public Library last year was the thriller “Girl On A Train” by Paula Hawkins.
It seems the Mayor has a long way to go in their effort to raise the class and racial consciousness of their constituents. But you can be sure he's working hard to achieve a Marxist world.
'Unnoticed': Woman in coma gives birth to stillborn
Updated
The Perth hospital in which a woman gave birth to a stillborn baby without staff noticing has defended its level of care.
Sharon May was in an induced coma in intensive care while being treated for pneumonia and swine flu at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.
Mrs May was 24 weeks' pregnant, when last month while still in a coma they gave birth to a stillborn boy.
They were found in their bed when a nurse checked on them
Mrs May's husband, Danny, says the system has let the family down.
"I think they failed us big time," they said.
"How can you grieve? The body is a broken vessel at the moment.
"How do you deal with it? It's not a question I can answer."
Hospital management says it is doing all it can to assist the family and it stands by its medical care delivered to all patients admitted with swine flu.
Spokeswoman Dr Shirley Bowen says the level of care was appropriate.
"We do not believe we have provided anything but excellent care to this woman," they said.
"We provided a high standard of care. We followed the obstetrician's advice completely.
"I do not believe that there was anything in terms of their care that should have been provided and did not provide to prevent this outcome."
The May family's lawyer has called for a coronial investigation.
Mr May's lawyer, John Hammond, says there needs to be a coronial inquiry.
"And there should be a full ministerial investigation as to why the health system has so dramatically failed and is it now in a permanent state of collapse," they said.

TACOMA, Wash. (KOMO) -- A Vietnam and Iraq War veteran from Spanaway died Thursday following a crash with two cars that police say were street racing.
Rollin Gray, 61, died at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma on Thursday after being taken there following the Tuesday night accident.
Pierce County sheriff's deputies say Gray was traveling eastbound on 182st East in Spanaway when two cars came over the horizon at a high rate of speed in the opposite direction.
Deputies say a red 2004 Dodge Stratus, driven by a 16-year-old boy from Spanaway with only a learner's permit, was racing with a black 2004 Acura TSX driven by an 18-year-old man from Spanaway.
Witnesses told police the Acura and Dodge drivers met up at a gas station at 176th St. E. and 22nd Ave. E. Both drivers knew each other from school and exchanged comments on each other's vehicles. Both vehicles left the gas station and traveled side roads.
Witnesses told investigators they saw and heard both vehicles racing on 182nd St. E. The 18-year-old driver then cut in front of the 16-year-old driver, causing them to lose control and cross into oncoming traffic. The Stratus struck the motorcycle being ridden by Gray. The driver of the Acura left the area and was later contacted by deputies.
Gray and their black 2006 Harley-Davidson motorcycle were found by a witness in shrubs on the side of the road. Gray was suffering from severe injuries to their leg, head and back.
"It makes everyone so angry, it was a senseless stupid accident," said friend Bill Saxton, who is also a riding member in a motorcycle club Gray belonged to, the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association.
"Our organizations mottos is vets helping vets. If anyone needed help, Rollin was there," says Saxton.
They say Gray was a veteran of the Vietnam War. After fighting overseas, they battled cancer and won. It was enough of a motivation for Gray to rejoin the military, serving the combat zone during the Iraq War.
"They have taken a man's life who did nothing but give to this country, give to their community, raise a family," said Saxton. "He still has a son who's not even out of high school yet, I believe he's 15-years-old, he's their namesake and now he's left without a father."
Deputies say there were no signs of impairment were observed from either of the drivers or an 18-year-old passenger in the Dodge. The drivers of the Dodge and of the Acura were both cited and released. That was before Gray's death. It's now up to the Pierce County Prosecutor to decide if the pair warrant stiffer charges.
Saxton says Gray will be buried at the place where they worked for several years, where many local vets are buried -- the Tahoma National Cemetery. Saxton says that's where Gray's father, who is also a vet, is buried.
Bravely Second Shares A Peek At Magnolia's Outfits And The Game In Motion
By Sato . August 25, 2014 . 6:36am
In this morning's Square Enix Presents Japan, Bravely series producer Tomoya Asano and assistant producer Shinji Takahashi made an appearance to have lighthearted discussions about the the series, along with some scant information on Bravely Second.
Square Enix shared a glimpse of the game in motion, where they showed Magnolia walking around town, along with a few of their looks in different job forms. They also mentioned that the 3D effects look much better overall when compared to Bravely Default.
As previously reported, Bravely Second will have new and returning jobs, and Square Enix plan on revealing the latest jobs and Asterisk holders over time. They will also have a playable battle demo at Tokyo Game Show next month.
Magnolia Arch will have a nice variety of hairstyles and color patterns with their job outfits, which will set them apart from the other characters as far as looks go.
They also shared another look at the Magnolia figure that will be available on March 27, 2015 in Japan for about 11,120 yen (about $106.97). It will also come with a DLC code for Bravely Second.
During the stream, they introduced Tatsuhiro Futagi, who previously worked as an associate producer at Square Enix for the Japanese localization of Thief. They will work alongside Asano and Takahashi as an assistant producer to Bravely Second.
While we didn't get to see any combat action, the developers mentioned that Bravely Second will also have the adjustable encounter system that was in Bravely Default.
Bravely Second will be featured in several future episodes of Square Enix Presents Japan, whenever the development team feel like they have something special to share, but we can expect to hear more on Bravely Second during Tokyo Game Show in September.
Meanwhile, you can check out some of the game in motion that was shown during the stream, courtesy Nintendo Everything:
Bravely Second is currently in development for Nintendo 3DS.
Greetings rookies. We trust you are settling in well in your new role as a Valkyrie pilot? You'll do well to remember that no amount of virtual training exercises or the scouting of maps can prepare you for the intensity of a real battle against live opponents... and so we are here to help.
At some point, you'll be called upon to traverse the vast spaces of New Eden in order to secure control points and take down enemy carriers. That said, for the most part, you will be engaging in ferocious head-on battles with enemy squadrons, intent on your destruction.
You will not be alone. You will work as a team. What follows is a series of training modules that will help you survive in a Deathmatch situation. We begin with advice for fighter pilots from one of the best exponents of the craft in known space, SuperKev.
General Advice
The object of a Team Deathmatch (TDM) is pretty straightforward on the face of it. Just kill 30 of your opponents' ships before they kill 30 of yours. So, to state the obvious, you must do two things: kill as many as possible and avoid getting killed yourself.
A lot of people focus on going in hard without thinking, but they forget that each time they are sent back to the tubes, their team moves one point closer to losing. Fortunately, the fighter class gives you a great opportunity to contribute both in the killing and avoiding getting killed departments.
Ship Choice
Choose a fighter with excellent firepower. The Wraith is the obvious choice here. With its upgraded capacitor, you can often maintain a speed and turning advantage over your pursuers. The Wraith's strong armor lets it take a lot of punishment and survive encounters that would kill lesser ships.
To Assuage is my second choice for a fighter in a TDM situation. It's not as durable as a Wraith, but it feels nimble and fast. If your aim is true, you can deal out a lot of damage with its pulse cannon. Its EMS provides instant missile defense. When timed well, it allows you to stun pesky heavies and even fighters or support ships quite easily.
Squad Setup
I am typically a lone-wolf player, but flying in a squad has its obvious benefits. I usually fly a Wraith, so sometimes it's handy to have a healer like a Displacer or Guardian to keep my armor topped up after a heated encounter. I'm always happy when there's a Displacer on my squad, because its heal beam is effective and it drops spiderbots, which can literally be a life-saver when you're low on armor. Another handy wingman in a TDM is the Revenant. Aside from its minor healing capabilities, its corrupt beam gives its teammates a damage bonus, and its mines can create distracting and deadly hazards for your enemy.
If you're flying with a squad, try to stick together. As a fighter, it's your job to keep your healer alive, just like it's their job to keep you alive. You don't do any good to each other on opposite ends of the map.
Specific Strategies
Always remember your dual goals of killing and not getting killed, so position yourself accordingly.
The best places to achieve these goals are spots that offer good cover and opportunities for ambushing your opponents. Take time to practice weaving in and out of structures at high speeds. These maneuvers will serve you well when you're being pursued by multiple bogies or missiles. If multiple enemies are targeting you, weaving through structures breaks up their coordination and can cause them to lose visual contact with you. Often, some of your pursuers will break off the chase and go after an easier target instead, or one of your teammates will join the fight to help you out. When your attackers get sufficiently broken up and confused, you can often turn the fight around on them by going on the offensive and taking them out one at a time.
You don't always have to stay in cover; you can pop out to engage an enemy. Just don't allow yourself to be dragged too far into the open where you'll be easy pickings for pod missiles and phasers.
Speaking of phasers, they can peck you to death if you're not careful. If you're being phasered, do not try to run away. Instead, try to get close to the ship firing at you. Phasers are less likely to hit you if you're close to them, so your fighter's fixed aim weapons will give you a major advantage at close quarters. If you're fighting a Banshee that's dropping spider bots, just pick them off. The Banshee's probably stripped your shields with its beam anyway, so you might as well prevent it from using those spiderbots to heal its own armor.
A TDM will often start to swing heavily in one team's favor if they manage to gain a numbers advantage on the battlefield. If you launch from the tubes and see that there's nothing but a ball of red ships on your HUD, resist the urge to fly right over there. They'll just pounce on you en masse and you'll find yourself back in the clone room again. Linger near your carrier until two or three more of your teammates launch, so you can go in as a group. Use the Com Alerts wheel to urge your team to "Group up!" Or, you can find an enemy ship that's strayed from the ball. Targeting enemies on the fringes of a group and drawing them away from safety-in-numbers is a good way to spread the battle out and give your team a fighting chance.
Focus on taking out the greatest threat on the enemy team. Sometimes this is a skilled fighter pilot, or a support pilot keeping a number of other ships alive, or a Gorgon that's lobbing pod missiles into the fray. By sending the biggest threat back to the tubes, you temporarily prevent them from doing more damage to your team, thereby giving your team a chance to stack up a lead.

Fly safe!

A gay couple who held hands in a supermarket have expressed their anger after a security guard told them they were acting inappropriately.
Thomas Rees and Joshua Bradwell were in a Sainsbury's store in Hackney when the guard told them a woman had complained about their behaviour.
"It's really knocked me for six and I've spent the last day or so analysing how I'm perceived," said Mr Rees.
Sainsbury's apologised and offered them a £10 voucher.
The 32-year-old said they were holding hands, and that they may have put their arm around their partner's waist as they were buying their food on Monday evening.
"We weren't celebrating good news, we weren't all over each other, we weren't in the throes of passion - it was essentially just holding my boyfriend's hand as I do every day. I'm very much in love and that's how I express my love," they said.
After they paid, a security guard told them about the complaint after they beckoned them outside so they would not be embarrassed, which "aggravated it more".

"I have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about. I shouldn't be removed from the store," said Mr Rees.
"All it's done is strengthened the importance that if you love someone, irrelevant of their gender, that is love and you should express that love in whatever way you desire or wish to. "
Mr Rees tweeted the supermarket giant and got a message back apologising and offering the voucher.
But they said they would like a phone call from them instead explaining how they train staff members to deal with diversity.
'Infuriating'
They added: "I do feel for the security guard because they were clearly unable or poorly equipped to handle these situations.
"He explained that they were brought up to believe 'live and let live' but they had to let us know that a complaint has been made and they kept repeating this complaint which was infuriating."
A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said: "We sincerely apologise to Thomas and Josh.
"We are an inclusive retailer and employer and do not tolerate discrimination in our stores.
"We will take appropriate action once we've concluded our investigation with our security contractor."
Walked off
Jo Wales, 35, contacted BBC News to claim they were also victimised at a Sainsbury's store in Wimbledon when a cashier apparently refused to serve them and their male partner at Christmas and instead glared at them from two checkouts away.
They wrote an email to the supermarket giant's CEO but did not hear back until about a month later, by which point they said they had moved on.
Sainsbury's said it was unable to investigate this incident because it happened so long ago, but added it was not something which happened often.
Two years ago, a "big kiss" protest was held at a Sainsbury's store in Brighton after a lesbian couple was asked to leave when one gave their partner a kiss on the cheek.
