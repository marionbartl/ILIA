Four students who got into the two top universities in China were given a parade by their town to celebrate their achievements.
The parade was held on August 18 in Bobai County in China's Guangxi province.
The students had scored highly in the Gaokao or college entrance exam often referred to as the 'world's toughest exam.'
A celebration: The parade featured motorbikes, trucks and SUVs carrying the students
The four students had been admitted to the two top universities in China
Footage posted by the People's Daily Online shows the four students being paraded around the town.
According to reports, the parade lasted some 40 minutes.
The students can be seen standing through the sunroofs of four separate SUVs as a truck also joins them saying their achievements.

The students have been admitted to Peking and Tsinghua Universities known to be the two top schools in the country.
Over nine million high school graduates sit the exam every year. The test, known as 'gaokao' in China is known for being difficult and examines students on their Chinese, maths and English along with a science or humanities subject of their choice.
If students fail the Gaokao, it will make it hard for them to get a good paying job. Because of these students spend hours studying for the test with some revising for 16 hours a day in extreme cases.

On Friday, October 12, 2012, the New York Comic Con was in full swing. Later that night, a few blocks form the Javits Convention Center that housed the convention, Y: The Last Man and Saga writer Brian K. Vaughan was scheduled to appear at a party hosted by Multiversity Comics and Image Comics. For a $10 cover, revelers could get in, have a few cocktails, and mingle with comics creators. The door proceeds benefited the Hero Initiative.
At 10 in the morning on Friday, October 12, 2012, the Hero Initiative booth at the con was already swamped. People were asking about the party, and specifically about Vaughan. The main question: Would Brian be signing autographs at the party?
The booth staff was a bit befuddled. The event was billed as a party. Have a drink. Chat. Mingle. Snap off some photos with friends. No one wanted to obligate Vaughan, or any of the talent, to do more than just kick back and relax. The answer came back: "We don't think so. It's a party. Just go and have fun."
"Too bad," one fan said. "I'd pay $50 if I could just get Vaughan to sign two books for me."
**********
Make no mistake: We live in the age of the $25 Brian Vaughan signature. If only Vaughan would sign them at $25. They sign for free.
If that sounds to you like a market failure that would make Adam Smith spin in their grave, you're probably right. And it's very emblematic of the strange time and place we exist in when it comes to comic conventions. By and large, the talent doesn't want to be paid (yet!) to sign books for fans and the general public. Former DC Comics president and Legion of Super-Heroes writer Paul Levitz also falls squarely into this camp. “They already paid their 10 cents, or maybe 12, for the book,” Levitz quips. “The least I can do is sign it for free.”
From their most nascent days in the 1960s until well into the '80s, most comic conventions were made up of a dozen dealers and three artists in an off-ramp Ramada Inn ballroom. But those days are now dust. As conventions ramp up, the money rolls in. That 2012 New York Comic Con boasted 116,000 attendees. At an average ticket price of $50 a pop, that's $5.8 million in ticket revenue alone, to say nothing of booth sales and sponsorships. That critical mass of footfalls and money invariably leads to ground-level entrepreneurs looking to take inefficacies out of any economy. Just like people were being paid up to $300 a day to wait in line for some rich guy to buy an iPhone 5, so too do comic conventions now have paid line-waiters. Really. And some of them are paid to get 50 copies of the same book signed by a creator…for free.
“I never know what to do with that,” admits longtime writer and artist Rick Remender. “It's one thing to have a guy come up with a run of your books, like one copy each. I'm always really happy to sign 'em. But then you get the guy with a pile of just one issue, all specially cased so you sign in the same place. I don't want to be a dick and say, ‘You want me to sign 50 copies of X-Force #1? Really?' But I know that's you looking to monetize my signature.”
Faced with a dilemma, Remender errs on the side of the angels. “I'm dealing with…maybe a fan who's also trying to make some money?” they muse. “I don't know. I don't wanna be a dick, so I want to sign three, maybe five, but I usually just wind up signing them all. In many ways, it's easier.”
“Easier” is hard to find these days, especially at high-volume venues such as New York Comic Con and San Diego. In fact, the sheer volume of people—multiplied by one security guard in particular—caused one creator to take an extended sabbatical from San Diego.

While at the 2012 San Diego con, Fables creator Bill Willingham says that “Some security guy put their open hand right in my chest, pushed me aside and said, ‘Celebrity coming through!' And…you just don't shove guys aside because you're an important security guy and important minor TV celebrities are on their way. It was a wide-open area of floor out in the concourse. It just didn't need to happen.”
Willingham later found out that the TV celebrity in question was comedian Paul Scheer. “The next day I announced I would not be back to San Diego the next year, and the immediate assumption became—boom!—that I was pissed off by this incident. Yes, I was pissed off by the incident, and I think it's both annoying and silly that you could be the highest of comic guys at this con and not be assigned the security of even a minor TV celebrity, but that had nothing to do with the decision not to come back. That decision had been made months ahead of time.”
Willingham says that the sheer weight of the con is just too much to put up with on a regular basis, even once a year. “San Diego is just mentally and physically exhausting to attend,” they say. “Anything you go to, you have to leave 40 minutes earlier than you normally would, because you have to swim like a dysfunctional salmon through a sea of flesh.”
Willingham sees the influx of people as a double-edged sword. One edge is, of course, Big Moving Pictures. “The TV and Hollywood people, other then the very few who actually do enjoy comics, wouldn't be caught dead in the comics section,” they say. “I love the fact that this thing has gotten huge and all that, but San Diego—and you can fill in any of the other big mega-conventions—isn't really one convention. It's like 12 smaller conventions that just happen to be taking place at the same time in the same place. And all the non-comic media have realized ‘This is the place where we need to go to get a head start on promoting whatever it is we're flogging this year.'”

Rick Remender is a San Diego vet. They attended their first con there in 1993, and has made the scene again every year from 1997 to the present. But these days, he's an attendee and not an exhibitor. “In San Diego, the evolution has been from comics-focused to more media-driven,” they say. “San Diego has gotten so big, and it's easy to get lost in all the white noise. Given how expensive the show is, I stopped doing tables there in 2007.”
And when San Diego gets full to bursting, two things happen: The public hears about it and craves more comic convention experiences, and the other cons benefit.
“The other shows I've been doing on a regular basis—Heroescon, Seattle, WonderCon when it was in San Francisco—have become what San Diego used to be,” Remender observes. “They're still very comic-centric. And they have also grown in attendance in the last few years.”
They've grown so much that artists can make way more money being artists at conventions than in the pages of a Marvel or DC book. Look no further than beloved longtime comic artist George Pérez.
“I can earn more in a single weekend of convetioneering than I would in an entire month drawing comics,” Pérez says. “And I get a pretty high rate drawing comics.”
Pérez is fortunate in that they have an almost-40-year track record in the business and the fan base that comes along with that longevity. Quick convention sketches, typically at $40 or $50 a pop, are their stock-in-trade.
“Fans are hungry for original artwork,” they say. “I had to start charging less for simpler sketches to try and please as many fans as possible. I used to charge a higher amount for a more finished sketch. But now it's simple headshots that typically take me between three and five minutes, and I earn much more doing that than I would spend more time on tighter sketches. Plus, more fans get ‘the experience' they want, so I see it as a win-win.”
That experience? Pérez thinks it's unique to the comic con biz. “It's so different from getting autographed photos from actors or sports figures,” they observe. “Athletes and actors can't play the game or perform the part in a convention setting. No one can reasonably ask someone to hit a home run or give them a scene from Macbeth for a small amount of money in a con setting. But fans can have me do exactly what I do to earn a living for them! I've got fans hiring me for three to five minutes at a time!”

Many artists strike a balance between doing their published work at a drawing table during the week, and hitting conventions on the weekends. But more seem to be shifting into con-only mode. “There are artists who make their living now going to conventions…because now you can,” says Pérez.
And again, as competition increases, the demand for name creators at conventions intensifies. Pérez used to look only as far as the end of a calendar year to slate their convention appearances. Now he's booking cons three years out, as conventions relentlessly pursue talent. Enter…the appearance fee.
“I'm also charging appearance fees, and I know many other artists are as well,” Pérez says. “It's one way of ‘evening the playing field,' from my point of view, as more requests for appearances have come in. No matter if you're large or small, you have to pay the appearance fee.”
Just a few years ago, the standard was that a convention would fly and hotel a creator, and slide them a free artist alley table as compensation for a con appearance. Now, pretty much all “name” creators can charge an appearance fee if they wish. Rates typically start at about $500 on the low end, and can quickly rise to $5000 or $10,000 for top-tier talent. Rates as high as $40,000 to $50,000—Paging Neil Gaiman!—are rare, but not unheard-of.

The highest-end rates, indeed, can put comic talent on a par with Big Moving Pictures people (and even minor TV celebrities). When Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood appears at a con, he's typically paid a guarantee of $40,000 to $50,000 against sales of autographs and photo opportunities (tho' Frodo Baggins gets first-class air and a hotel suite as well). Things can get higher. If you want a genuine Dr. Who (Matt Smith) or a lady-killer Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the fee can be $100,000, plus perhaps a few Van Halen-esque riders as well.
Many comic creators have a “friends and family” sort of list with a few favorite cons where they don't ask for an appearance fee. Pérez is quick to point out that Orlando's MegaCon is right in their back yard, and owner/operator Beth Widera is a friend. They wouldn't think of asking a fee there. But they also pride themselves on putting in the work to earn their fees.
“I look at it like I've been hired by the convention,” Pérez says. “As far as I'm concerned, I'm there to do everything I can to make the fan experience as pleasant as possible. So I'm working for that money. One thing I'm particularly proud of is that a convention will usually ask me back for the next year after I've only been at the show for a day or two, because of my rapport with the fans. I look at like they want to re-hire me, because I do well with the fans. I want to make sure I'm conducting myself professionally, and I'm worth the extra bucks.”
As the business has become more of a “business,” the friends-and-family cons rack up an advantage against the larger concerns.
“If it's a corporation, you do feel a bit like a number,” Pérez says. “Sometimes I'll meet some chairperson of the board of some convention, and they have no idea who I am. There have been many conventions where I've spent the night alone at the hotel because I don't know anyone. If there's no personal con organizer, no one thinks to ask you if you want to go to dinner, which would be nice. So sometimes, it's a bit of a job, but it is balanced out by the ones that are more a mom-and-pop organization.”
Interestingly enough, Rick Remender has seen their “mom-and-pop” days move into the mainstream, just as conventions have done the same. Remender cut their teeth on the con circuit lugging boxes of creator-owned projects such as Black Heart Billy, Strange Girland XXXombies to cons before they started writing Punisher, X-Force and Secret Avengers for Marvel.
“I've been doing shows for 16 years now steadily, so…I just don't know how to not do them anymore,” they laugh. “With the independent work, it's very important to make a personal pitch. People might come over because they know me from a Marvel job, but I can hand-sell them a Fear Agent or a Strange Girl or a XXXombies book that they may not have heard of. And many times at these shows, people will come back and say that my turning them on to a creator-owned book was a good experience for them, and they're now buying truckloads of the stuff. I always think about it like this: Every time you sell a book and have an interaction with a fan that's personal, even a brief conversation, you connect on a deeper level. Then if they read and like the book, you have a customer for the long term.”
Bill Willingham thinks those opportunities and interactions still exist, despite any growing pains. “There are many conventions I love: Emerald City [in Seattle], though it seems to be on the threshold of being one of those huge headache conventions, is run by people who truly love comics,” they say. “The Baltimore show and the Heroes [Charlotte] show are fine as well. Things like that where the people who put them on clearly love comics…yeah, I like being at those shows.”
And at the end of the day, Remender likes them, too. “I've had dozens of people show up with tattoos of Black Heart Billy, Heath Huston from Fear Agent, lots of Doll and Creature tattoos,” they say. “It's always so incredibly flattering to meet people who are so connected to something you wrote and created that they go get the character tattooed on them for life. That's always an incredible experience, to see that these things that you create in your room somewhere have made it out to the world in that way. And the conventions, in many ways, are my window into the world.”

Virgin space tourists could be launched from Scotland by 2015
An RAF base in Scotland could be launching tourists into space by 2015, it has been revealed today.
Sir Richard Branson's UK Space Agency has identified Lossiemouth as the ‘ideal' location from where a spaceflight would take off.
Will Whitehorn, the Virgin Galactic president, said the company is pressing for changes to legislation in Britain which does not permit commercial flights.

‘It's one of the first things that the UK Space Agency is looking at. Lossiemouth would be ideal — a long runway and clear airspace is what we'd want,' Mr Whitehorn told The Times today.
Virgin Galactic is confident that space tourism will go ahead by 2012 in the U.S. – having already taken more than $65million (£45million) in bookings from 335 wannabe astronauts.
About 50 per cent of those already signed up are American, with the next biggest interest coming from Britain.
The physicist Stephen Hawking, the environmentalist James Lovelock and most recently the comedian Russell Brand have reserved their places.

Mr Whitehorn said UK Space Agency is pushing the government to amend the 1986 Outer Space Act, which did not account for space tourists.
‘Not surprisingly, people didn't envisage human space flight from the UK in 1986, let alone that it would be a centre for space tourism,' they told the Cheltenham Science Festival.
Each aspiring space tourist will have to pay about $200,000 (£134,000) for a few minutes of suborbital spaceflight.
However, there are no fitness requirements for passengers, with older people singled out as being able to cope better with high g-forces, according to Mr Whitehorn.
‘Our oldest customer, James Lovelock, is 92. We put them in a centrifuge and they were absolutely fine,' they said.
Older people's arteries tend to be narrower and less responsive, meaning they would be less likely to experience sudden rushes of blood to the head, which can cause people to pass out.
Virgin SpaceShipTwo, which made its inaugural test flight over the California desert in March, will be carried by WhiteKnightTwo to an altitude of 50,000ft and then released by the mothership.
Commercial operations are set to begin in 2012. A crew of two will fly the spaceship which will carry six passengers through the edge of the atmosphere for a brief zero-gravity experience and views of the Earth far below before gliding to a landing.
Saudi Arabia mobilised its F-15 fleet to launch a military operation against the Hezbollah in Lebanon.
I have no idea what the KSA hopes to accomplish here. Nor do I understand what caused the ongoing palace coup, other than old-fashioned extortion.
In some cases the government is seeking to appropriate as much as 70 per cent of suspects' wealth, two of the people said, in a bid to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into depleted state coffers.
But I can say for certain, if recent history is any guide, this will turn out badly for the Saudi kingdom.
At the center of this crisis is Prince Muhammad bin Salman.
Meet Prince Muhammad bin Salman – overambitious and cunning, a heartbeat away from succeeding their 81-year-old father King Salman bin Abdul Aziz, reportedly suffering from dementia – leading their own Game of Thrones in the Desert Kingdom.
A young, inexperienced heir to the Arab world's most powerful throne, Bin Salman is consolidating their power by crushing potential centres of power outside the Royal Court. The need is urgent after their string of failures, including initiatives in Yemen and Qatar, and all-consuming, counterproductive hatred of Shia-majority Islamic Republic of Iran.
Remember the Qatar crisis? It's still on-going.
The emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, warned of the collapse of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) - an alliance of Gulf countries - should the crisis with Qatar remain unresolved.
The Qatar boycott is costing the GCC countries big money, and it might destroy the GCC.
The Saudi's record of failure began years before.
According to a top-secret National Security Agency document provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the March 2013 rocket attacks were directly ordered by a member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Salman bin Sultan, to help mark the second anniversary of the Syrian revolution. Salman had provided 120 tons of explosives and other weaponry to opposition forces, giving them instructions to “light up Damascus” and “flatten” the airport, the document, produced by U.S. government surveillance on Syrian opposition factions, shows.
The Saudis worked hard to destroy Syria and the Assad regime, one of Iran's very few allies. In the end, the Saudis managed to kill hundreds of thousands of people, but the Assad regime is now fully in Iran's sphere of influence.
While Prince Salman has their fingers all over the Qatar crisis, and the Syrian civil war, it's the catastrophic war against Yemen that defines their foreign policy.
“The Saudi Arabia-led coalition strategic air campaign continues to have little operational or tactical impact on the ground, and is only serving to stiffen civilian resistance,” according to a blunt verdict by a U.N. Security Council panel of experts. It is also helping to “consolidate” a military alliance between ethnic Houthi insurgents and Yemen's disgraced former leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who control 13 of the country's governorates, including the capital of Sana'a.
The disarray has provided a rich breeding ground for extremists, including the Islamic State and al Qaeda, which, the panel believes, “is looking to launch terrorist attacks against targets in the ‘West.'”
The U.N. isn't the only ones recognizing Saudi failure in Yemen.
Last week, a series of leaked emails revealed that Saudi Arabia's crown prince and defence minister, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, expressed a desire to end the war in Yemen during talks with former US officials. In the leaked emails, Mohammed bin Salman said that they '"wants out" of the two-year war they started in Yemen and that they were not against US rapprochement with Iran to end the conflict.
Before the Saudis began bombing Yemen, the Houthis had very little to do with Iran. Now they are clients of Iran.
In an interesting twist, former Yemeni President Hadi, who Salman is trying to reinstall to power in Yemen, is under 'house arrest' in Riyadh.
In an even more interesting twist, former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who the Saudis forced to resign, is also under house arrest in Riyadh.
Image caption The new law covers a range of online activities
The Philippines' top court has suspended a controversial law targeting cybercrime, following protests by critics who say it stifles free speech.
The new law, called the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012, came into effect earlier this month.
It was intended to prevent online child pornography, identity theft and spamming, officials say. Reports say a 120-day suspension is in place.
The law also made libel a cybercrime punishable by up to 12 years in jail.
The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the act from being enforced after 15 petitions questioning its legality were filed.
The government says the law is intended to address "legitimate concerns" about criminal and abusive behaviour online.
But protesters say the legislation could be used to target government critics and crack down on freedom of speech.
Under the new act, a person found guilty of libellous comments online, including comments made on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter or blogs, could be fined or jailed.
The act is also designed to prevent cybersex, defined as sexually explicit chat over the internet - often involving "cam girls" performing sexual acts in front of webcams for internet clients.
Government officials would also have had new powers to search and seize data from people's online accounts.
The law generated a number of protests - anonymous activists hacked into government websites and journalists held rallies.
In a statement, Human Rights Watch's Asia director Brad Adams welcomed the move by the court, but urged it to "now go further by striking down this seriously flawed law".
From the beginning of next year, the unemployed will have to look for work through the Coalition's new Universal Jobmatch website or potentially risk losing their benefits.
The website will scan the CVs of benefit claimants and automatically match them up with job openings that suit their skills.
It will also allow employers to search for new workers among the unemployed and send messages inviting them to interviews.
However, the activities of benefit claimants can also be tracked using devices known as "cookies", so their Job Centre advisers can know how many searches they have been doing, suggest potential jobs and see whether they are turning down viable opportunities.
Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said the scheme would "revolutionise" the process of looking for work.
The tracking element of the programme will not be compulsory as monitoring people's behaviour online without their consent would not be allowed under EU law.
But job advisers are able to impose sanctions such as compulsory work placements or ultimately losing benefits if they feel the unemployed are not searching hard enough.
Mr Duncan Smith said: “If you choose not to take a job that matches you, then the adviser will look at your reasons, and if the adviser thinks ‘actually, these are pretty specious reasons', they may call you in and say ‘I think you really need to be applying for these jobs'.”
They said the website will mean Job Centre advisers are able to target their help at jobseekers with problems, while letting capable candidates get on with their searches.
"For the very small percentage that have a real problem - maybe they have absolutely no skills - we want them in front of the adviser," they said.
"And if they're just not playing ball, they will be in front of the adviser. These are little trip wires, if we think they're not applying for it. There are lots of things the adviser can do.”
The Work and Pensions Secretary said jobseekers can be hauled in every day if advisers "think they're not up to the activity” they are meant to be doing.
“We have some interesting programmes like mandatory work activity if the [advisers] think they're having trouble getting out of bed, if they're not playing the game.”
Around 690,000 people have signed up to it so far, with more than half giving their Government job adviser access to their profile and activities.
The website has already signed up 370,000 employers and jobseekers are conducting about five million searches a day.
Mr Duncan Smith also confirmed their department is looking at introducing a ‘welfare card', instead of some benefits, for drug addicts. This could only be used to purchase certain items, such as food and other essentials, stopping them from spending their benefits on drugs.
“I've been looking at this process to figure out whether it's feasible, how would it work, how does it match with legal obligations, so we've already been examining this," they told the BBC's World at One. "There's nothing at the moment on plans, but I genuinely think there are some areas where we might want to think about.
“You know, somebody who has a history of real drug addiction, giving people cash sometimes can actually lead to further problems.”
The Navy has spent more than 15 years cleaning up contaminated groundwater underneath two former gas station sites at Alameda Point. They are still at it, but it's not because the Navy is slow or lacking in commitment and expertise. It's the nature of groundwater cleanup, which involves intermittent treatment efforts.
In July, the Navy's contractor returned to the old gas station and car wash site on West Pacific Avenue at Main Street and to the old commissary gas station site at West Tower Avenue and Main Street across from Bayport. It's the third visit to these sites to eliminate petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in groundwater, in addition to earlier removal of underground tanks, fuel lines, and soil. The contaminants are located from 2 to 16 feet below ground surface.
The goal is to bring the property up to the public health and environmental standards required for the future commercial and residential uses previously determined by the city.
“When groundwater contamination is involved, such as at the two former gas stations, cleanups often involve multiple phases, each building upon earlier accomplishments,” said Dr. Peter Russell, who has been reviewing Navy cleanup plans and preparing cleanup-related documents on behalf of, and at the direction of, the city since 1997. “As long as all imminent health and environmental risks are eliminated early on, often the most cost-effective approach to complete remediation is incremental,” explained Russell. “In contrast, a massive initial remedial effort that is sure to achieve all remedial goals in one pass would likely involve over-sizing the treatment system, which is more disruptive and expensive than a phased approach.”
During previous cleanup visits, the Navy used a vapor extraction system to remove the bulk of the petroleum contamination. The process involves pumping air into numerous pipes, called wells, which extend into the water-saturated zone where the contamination is. The air pressure creates vapor that is part air, part water and part petroleum. The vapor is then sucked out through another set of wells, and the petroleum vapors are captured in drums of granulated charcoal, while the water is shunted off to a separate container.
The method of blowing bubbles in mud and sucking out the air sounds unsophisticated, but it works. After running the system in 2013 and 2014 at the West Pacific Avenue gas station site, for example, the level of one contaminant, benzene, went from around 1,000 micrograms per liter down to 58, bringing the contamination low enough to allow indigenous bacteria to finish the job.
The Navy returned to these sites in July and, in this phase, they came to help natural bacteria finish up the job. Allowing bacteria to clean up petro chemicals through natural digestion is called bioremediation. To be effective and not take a century to eliminate the problem, the bulk of the chemicals need to first be reduced to concentrations that do not overwhelm the bacteria.
At both gas station sites the Navy used a special product designed to foster growth of natural bacteria in the ground, which includes a form of time-release peroxide that turns into oxygen over a period of 12 months. An oxygen environment is necessary for the bacteria to digest petroleum. The bacteria utilize the hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon) in the petroleum chemicals as part of their metabolic processes and convert them into carbon dioxide, water, and microbial cell mass. Water samples will be taken at three, six, and nine months after the July injections to evaluate effectiveness.
“The Navy's gas station remedial program is comparable to the private sector gas station cleanup program,” said Yemia Hashimoto, Engineering Geologist with the San Francisco Bay Water Board. “The cleanup requirements are similar and the required timelines for project completion are similar.” The Water Board is a California state agency and is the lead regulatory agency overseeing the Navy's petroleum cleanup program.
The other type of groundwater contamination encountered at Alameda Point comes from a chlorinated solvent used in cleaning aircraft parts. Unlike lighter-than-water petroleum products, chlorinated solvents can sink through the upper water zone to a depth of 30 feet or more and complicate cleanup. But solvent cleanup still relies on a phased cleanup approach, often employing bacteria in the final phase.
Originally published in the Alameda Sun.
Complete background and a detailed description of the cleanup process at the two gas station sites is in the Bioremediation Work Plan issued in July 2015.

Economía Corfo externaliza producción de litio a multinacional estadounidense Se trata de un memorándum de entendimiento para que la empresa Rockwood Lithium aumente la producción desde el Salar de Atacama. Entre las medidas acordadas figura la de acceder a la información financiera y contable a través de un auditor externo. La compañía explota los recursos junto a SQM Salar, de propiedad de Julio Ponce Lerou. DiarioUchile Martes 2 de febrero 2016 17:02 hrs. Me Gusta Compartir
Entre 400 y 600 millones de dólares, durante los próximos cuatro años, son los que debiera invertir, con ayuda de Corfo, la empresa Rockwood Litio Ltda. para aumentar la producción de carbonato de litio y desarrollar tecnología que permita producir cinco mil toneladas de hidróxido de litio desde el Salar de Atacama. Se trata del acuerdo alcanzado este lunes entre ambas entidades, a través de un memorándum de entendimiento, que proyecta la construcción de una nueva planta, la tercera ubicada en el norte del país, con un costo de 400 millones de dólares.

Entre 400 y 600 millones de dólares, durante los próximos cuatro años, son los que debiera invertir, con ayuda de Corfo, la empresa Rockwood Litio Ltda. para aumentar la producción de carbonato de litio y desarrollar tecnología que permita producir cinco mil toneladas de hidróxido de litio desde el Salar de Atacama. Se trata del acuerdo alcanzado este lunes entre ambas entidades, a través de un memorándum de entendimiento, que proyecta la construcción de una nueva planta, la tercera ubicada en el norte del país, con un costo de 400 millones de dólares.

The main idea behind Clay Johnson's new book The Information Diet: A Case for Conscious Consumption is that we need to monitor the way we consume information in the same way we need to monitor what we eat and drink.
In today's “information age,” we are constantly being bombarded with facts and opinions from television, radio, cellphones, and computers. In fact, according to Eric Schmidt, a software engineer and executive chairperson at Google, every 48 hours there is more content being created on the internet than all the content that was created from the beginning of time to 2003.
That's a lot of new information being created everyday! And this unprecedented growth of information has both its upsides and downsides.
The positive is that normal people have more access to more information than ever before. When we have a question about something, most of us can do a quick Google search and find a fairly reliable source in a short amount of time. This is an obvious luxury of new information technology.
The negative is that a lot of the information we process on a daily basis goes unfiltered. Anyone can publish almost anything they want on a blog, or message board, or YouTube, or Facebook, or even Wikipedia. There's an abundance of information out there, but unfortunately a lot of consumers of this information don't question how good their sources are or whether or not the information is really helping them.
The Information Diet tells us that we should be a more conscious consumer of the information that we take in on a daily basis. Throughout the book, Johnson discusses many different ways our “information age” can become unhealthy. They also provide different tips and strategies we can use to improve our information diet, such as:
Respect the facts
Johnson recommends we stick to information that provides source material. If an article doesn't provide evidence, statistics, or citations, then you should be skeptical if what you're consuming is true. For example, Wikipedia is usually good with providing citations, but you'll find many sites don't mention where their claims come from. By avoiding sources that don't cite their claims, we can avoid misinformation and keep our information diet safe and healthy.
If we do happen to watch or read something that doesn't cite where its information comes from, then it's a good idea to at least do more research before considering the information true. This means occasionally fact-checking what you hear on TV, or on the radio, or even from a friend. In general, we shouldn't take anything at face value, and we should try to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism before accepting anything as true. Blindly following any information can be disastrous, but unfortunately it happens a lot in today's world of information abundance.
Balance different sources
Just like a healthy diet requires a balance of different food groups, so does a healthy information diet depend on multiple sources. If you get all your information from one source, then it's possible that you are only getting a limited perspective. Instead, it is better that you diversify where you get your information from. This will help you to understand opposing points-of-view better, and it will also help you corroborate evidence from different sources.
In The Information Diet, Johnson says many people aren't searching for information, but “affirmation.” We search for facts and opinions that confirm our existing beliefs, but we avoid facts and opinions that put our beliefs into question. In psychology this is referred to as a “confirmation bias.” This is why some people only watch one news station or visit one blog that shares their views. We like information that adheres to what we believe, but this tendency can lead us to ignore other information that is just as important.
Schedule time spent with media
Twenty years ago people had to make an appointment with their TV to watch a show. However today we can just DVR our media or stream it off the internet – and thus we have access to it whenever we want. This is one big reason Johnson believes many of us are suffering from “information obesity” we've become constant consumers of information and media, because we have endless access to it.
One thing Johnson recommends is that we make an appointment with our media – block out some time throughout the day exclusively for TV or internet, so that we can spend the rest of our day doing other things.
This helps us avoid the trap of getting lost in a maze of Google searches, Facebook refreshes, and YouTube marathons, when we could be doing something more productive with our time. When you make your TV or internet time into a limited resource, you tend to spend it more wisely.
Get in the mindset of a producer, not just a consumer
One of the biggest tips mentioned in The Information Diet is to start every morning writing 500 words. According to Johnson, this puts us into the mindset of a “producer” rather than just a “consumer” of information.
It's important that we don't just consume information throughout our day but that we also do something with it. Writing has shown to have many mental benefits, including improved learning, as well as better cognitive and emotional processing of information.
In many ways, writing functions as a kind of reflection, which gives us extra time to digest any information that we may have absorbed throughout the day. It also gives us a chance to be pro-active and creative with the information we are taking in, rather than just a passive consumer.
Writing a little every morning or night can be a great way to become a smarter consumer of information, because it allows us to reevaluate what we have learned and channel that information in our own way. By adopting a “producer mindset” we learn not to just consume for the sake of consuming, but to consume for the sake of producing.
Keep information practical and relevant
According to Johnson, another symptom of “information obesity” is feeling anxious about information that isn't actionable or relevant to our lives. If our seeking of information only leads us to worrying about things we can't control, we may want to start re-directing our attention toward other, more relevant things in our life.
Another outcome of seeking impractical and irrelevant information is “analysis paralysis.” This refers to our tendency to over-analyze or over-think a situation so that we never take action.
Sometimes our endless seeking of information can lead us to be “perfectionists” when it comes to making a decision. We feel we need to know everything there is to know before we can choose a course of action. Unfortunately, it's often impractical – if not impossible – to try to know everything before taking action. Instead, we have to accept that we will often make decisions with limited knowledge and a degree of uncertainty.
So even though we have access to so much information, we have to be careful not to go overboard on researching everything.
Summary
The information diet comes down to personal responsibility. We know from many studies in applied psychology and neuroscience that information affects us in ways we don't have complete control over. So it's important that we at least regulate the sources we get our information from.
In addition, The Information Diet claims there is a new kind of “digital literacy” emerging. 5,000 years ago literacy was a trade secret only known by scribes, 300 years ago literacy was the ability to write your name, and today literacy means being able to read a newspaper. However, Johnson suspects 30 years from now saying, “I'm not a computer person.” will be the equivalent of someone saying, “I don't know how to read.”
This only reinforces the importance of knowing how to be a smart consumer of information in the 21st century. As communication technologies continue to improve, the amount of information we are exposed to will continue to increase. It's important that we learn how to be masters of this information rather than become victims to it.

A Decade of Haiku
Ten years ago today, the first post appeared on the mailing list of our project - then still called "OpenBeOS" - officially marking the start of our endeavor. Back then, with the imminent demise of Be Inc., there was an excitement and creative motivation in the air, that lead many to think a first release was only a matter of a few years. As it turns out, this estimation was a bit too optimistic...
Others didn't have confidence in the project and attested a quick dissolving before having anything to show. They were apparently wrong too. After ten years Haiku is still here and making progress. And with a quite stable and feature rich Alpha 3 we have a pretty good picture of what R1 will look like.
In those 10 years many developers came and went, and some are still around, coding away with a passion. With further progress more and more non-coders became active and did their part to improve the system. This continued passion and determination in realizing a shared vision makes me confident that we'll see Haiku around in another ten years time. I wonder what soon-to-be-released version of Haiku we'll be excited about then...
Today, I've decided that I wanted to talk about one of the more subtle fundamentals in Yu-Gi-Oh--how not to side. Side decking can be a very complicated thing, but it doesn't have to be. I often see players lose entire games because they don't know how to do it. Incorrect siding includes putting in cards that are less than stellar when going first or second, siding too many cards for a specific matchup, which effectively ruins the foundation of your own deck, and siding the wrong cards altogether. I'm going to delve into each of these problems, and provide some insight on how you should be thinking when building and using your side deck.
So first things first: you have to realize that certain cards suck when going first, while other cards suck when going second. Examples of side deck cards that are mediocre or worse when going first include: Maxx “C,” Effect Veiler, Storm (I'll elaborate on why I chose this one later), The Monarchs Storm Forth, Raigeki, Denko Sekka, etc. These cards are all terrible when going first for the same reasons, too. For instance, Effect Veiler is bad when going first because you have no way of using it on your first turn, except maybe with Shaddoll Fusion. We all know that hand traps are used for slowing down your opponents on their first turn, since you didn't have a chance to set backrows yet. On top of that, you only get five cards when going first, so your other four cards would have to be pretty ideal to make your hand a good one. The same thing can be said about Maxx “C,” Raigeki, The Monarchs Storm Forth, and Denko Sekka. You don't want to open with cards that have no effect on the game until your opponent gets a turn. You should always be aiming for good, consistent hands. If you were going second, you would want all of these cards.
In the case of cards like Raigeki and The Monarchs Storm Forth, you would rather just have actual traps if you're going first. The asupervisorstioned spells deal with monsters after they have already hit the field and used whatever effects they have. Your goal is to deal with monsters before they get to resolve their effects or even come out in the first place. On the contrary, I love cards like this for going second because they can break up established fields. There's nothing better than tributing your opponent's Dante for Majesty's Fiend, or dropping Denko Sekka on three backrows. However, if there are no monsters to tribute, and no backrows to be frozen, then these cards aren't doing anything but adding to your bad hands. And don't let me get started on how bad they are if you're using a combo deck. Since everything requires more than one card to function, you don't have too much room to draw non-combo pieces.
Moving on to cards that are mediocre or worse when going second, we have: Bottomless Trap Hole, Solemn Warning, Vanity's Emptiness, Chain Disappearance, Skill Drain, Thunder King Rai-oh, etc. The concept is simple: you don't want to draw any of these cards when your opponent already has a field of monsters. What good is a Vanity's Emptiness against two Dantes? How about Chain Disappearance after they've already resolved a Tour Guide? And who would ever want Solemn Warning after there is already 5000 points of damage sitting on the other side of the field?
I learned this stuff back in the mid 2000s, when the greats were siding out Trap Dustshoot after winning game one because they knew they would be going second in game two. There was a chance that the Dustshoot would be dead immediately, and therefore it would just contribute to a bad hand. I carry that logic with me every time I dive into my side deck.
If you take all of the cards I named and switched them with going first or second, they become infinitely better. Skill Drain is amazing if you go first because you get a chance to set it before your opponent could have possibly resolved a real monster's effect. Chain Disappearance is great when you can set it on the first turn, too. You'll be able to catch the monster brought out by your opponent's Tour Guide, which will almost always end their turn. It completely stops them from establishing a field, but it sucks once they have already established a field.
You can also side incorrectly by putting in the wrong cards altogether. For example, I used to side Rivalry of the Warlords when Burning Abyss first came out, because it made it impossible for them to win. They would get stuck with either a Dante or Alucard on the field, and nothing else. Even if they didn't Xyz summon, it wasn't like a few low attack fiend monsters threatened me. If they used Phoenix Wing Wind Blast on it, they would have to kill me that turn. Rivalry happens to be pretty effective against established fields, especially when they're all different types, so when you spin it to the top of my deck, I'm just going to redraw it and flip it on your new field. The game has changed, however, making Rivalry of the Warlords an awful side card against Burning Abyss. Now, a BA player could just summon two monsters and set a Lake to get rid of the continuous trap. Unfortunately, there are people who still have not learned that continuous cards traps are not the ideal solution to BA problems.
Some Qliphort players still side Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror against the deck, knowing that all BA players bring in three Fairy Winds, and already have three Mystical Space Typhoons and three Fire Lakes. That's just not smart thinking. It would be more effective to side Ojama Trio and maybe even Flying “C” before you considered Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror.
The next and last topic are over side decking, which is just as bad as siding in cards that are not effective when going first or second. Sometimes, we overthink the matchups and end up with too much hate towards one particular deck. You'll see this a lot with Shaddoll players who side too heavily against Qliphorts. It's okay to side three Mystical Space Typhoons and three Fairy Winds, but once you start adding Dust Tornadoes and Twisters on top of that, you're going to end up with too many cards that do the same exact thing. This will undoubtedly lead to getting beat down by monsters. If you're swapping ten cards from your side deck into your main, you should probably reevaluate your strategy.
I remember when Satellarknights first came out, everyone—including myself—was siding infinite floodgate cards. Now, while this could win you some games, it can also lead to some pretty pathetic losses, too. If your opponent ever resolves a big monster, you might have a hard time dealing with it. After all, a Shadow-Imprisoning Mirror does not deal with a Shaddoll Construct's 2800 attack.
Another good example comes from this past weekend. I was watching the live coverage from ARGCS Atlanta, and there was a match where a player drew three copies of Storm against Ben Leverett in game three, and it outright lost them the game. I understand why you would want to side Storm if you're using Qliphorts, but three of it is certainly going overboard. You have to ask yourself if you would ever want to open with more than one copy of it. The answer is always going to be no, unless your other four cards are insane, in which case you would probably win anyway. By siding in too many cards that essentially do the same thing as several other cards in your deck, you tend to ruin the foundation. Ruining the foundation means you have ruined the consistency, and now your deck is fragile. It would have been the same result if they showed a hand that had a mixture of Mystical Space Typhoons, Storms, and Night Beams, too. I understand wanting to clear backrows, but what if that was all your deck could do—clear backrows? Of course there will be some games where your draw the perfect curve, and you clear the backrows and resolve several Scouts, but this is not a perfect world, and you should not side as though it is.
Until next time, duelists! Remember, Play Hard or Go Home!

IMF's (International Monetary Fund) Deputy Director for Capacity Development Andrew Berg, Research Department Senior Economist (at IMF) Luis-Felipe Zanna and Edward Buffie, a Professor of Economics at Indiana University Bloomington, just published an article articulating an analysis revolving around technological development and its implications on society, particularly regarding labor, capital and (in)equality. At the end of the article they refer to basic income as a possible solution, in order to redistribute the excess capital brought by the computerization of production.
But what do we have here? A miracle conversion of hard-core capitalist economists into soft-hearted left-wing liberals? Can we, after all, turn lead into gold? No, of course not. What we have here is textbook capitalist economy, with a new ingredient: basic income.
So their logic goes like this: We have inequality, but that is fine. Inequality is merely a result of market forces; we can live with that because we belong to that fortunate group of people who have not experienced poverty and cannot imagine experiencing poverty. But there are a couple of challenges with too much inequality: people revolt and cannot buy all these wonderful things corporate capitalism churns out daily. You see, this humanity thing has one big problem: it is full of humans. And humans, unlike machines, have two amazing features, which these brilliant economists have just discovered: they tend to fight back if pressed too much and cannot survive without their basic needs met.
The reason for this sudden, latent, realization has to do with the one thing all capitalists share: they are not entirely human. They hold this strange belief that there's nothing wrong with trying to extract more water from the well than the amount that exists there. It is like writing a three-thousand-page essay and drawing this sole conclusion: 1+1=3.
But back to the logic. So, inequality is tolerable, but not too much. The solution? Give these poor people a basic income and, all of a sudden, they stop being such bad loser crying babies and resume buying enough stuff to maintain this completely absurd system of domination, privilege and exploitation. Shut them up, so we can keep doing our thing without distraction. Note that I have not, until now, said a single thing about robots, computers or automation. Because at bottom it has nothing to do with that. With robots or not, the capitalist mind just wants to extract wealth. How they do it is irrelevant, or relevant only to the extent as it is efficient in doing so.
What these enlightened IMF economists, and possibly other IMF officials do not realize is that basic income is a complete game changer. It will allow people to say “no”, to enjoy enough freedom to completely turn the capitalist system on its head. And these people will start doing much more bizarre things, like volunteering for causes close to their heart, or starting their own businesses (refusing to be slaves to some capitalist boss), and enjoying more leisure time, and time to care for family and friends (go figure out why). Living out their own lives, for a change.
I predict that, after basic income is implemented, in part following up these economists' recommendations, capitalism will hardly resemble its own shadow in 10 to 20 years. Society will barely recognize itself, when looking back at today's world. Mark my words.

At the center of the North Korean nuclear crisis is a pivotal question: How much is China really willing to pressure and punish its longtime ally in Pyongyang? Recent conversations in Beijing and Washington suggest that Chinese leaders have decided to increase pressure substantially but are not—and probably never will be—willing to help President Trump strangle North Korea into submission. China doesn't trust Kim Jong-un—but it trusts Trump even less.
For decades, China backed North Korea in hostilities with the United States. The fellow Communist armies had fought alongside one another in the Korean War, and North Korea still relies on China for as much as ninety per cent of its overseas trade. In Chairman Mao's analogy, the two nations were as close as “lips and teeth.” But that is no longer true; since taking power, in 2011, Kim Jong-un, who is suspicious of China's efforts to control North Korea or spur it to follow its model of economic reform, has openly antagonized the government in Beijing, including launching rockets that would embarrass the Chinese leadership. (Earlier this month, Kim fired a rocket just as Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, was opening an annual summit of developing countries in the Chinese city of Xiamen.)
By several measures, Chinese leaders have become more willing to get tough with Kim. Until recently, Chinese intellectuals rarely questioned China's commitment to North Korea. But, in March, Shen Zhihua, one of China's best-known experts on the Korean War, said, in a speech, “We must see clearly that China and North Korea are no longer brothers-in-arms, and in the short term there's no possibility of an improvement in Chinese-North Korean relations.” The speech circulated widely, without much in the way of official censorship—a sign, to many Chinese analysts, that some of the country's leaders agree.
When I met Shen last month, in Beijing, they told me, “I think more and more leaders share this view. At a minimum, they think that multiple views should exist.” Shen is a calm, silver-haired scholar who works in a research center at East China Normal University, in Shanghai. As a historian, they believe that long-standing tensions between Beijing and Pyongyang are becoming irreparable. “Officially, they tried to paper over the cracks, but the differences were inevitable,” they said.
Shen does not speak for the leadership or advise powerful officials. Rather, their views should be understood as a reflection of the change that is under way in the Chinese establishment. Of North Korea, they said, “I think China doesn't care who is running the country. Xi and Kim have not met. It used to be a tradition if there is a new leader, to meet him. But not now.” Fundamentally, they said, some have come to believe what was once anathema—that North Korea could one day turn its aggression on China: “Many in China don't want North Korea to have nuclear weapons because nuclear weapons are, first, threatening to China.”
I wondered if Shen was expressing a minority view. When I met Zhao Tong, who specializes in nuclear issues as a fellow at the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, I asked them about Shen's speech. “I think most people would broadly agree,” Zhao said. “It's not a warm relationship of ‘brothers.' ” Given that North Korea has continued to test nuclear weapons in the face of Chinese protests, they said, China would not feel automatically compelled to defend North Korea under their mutual-assistance treaty. “Most Chinese would laugh at the proposal that China should provide security guarantees,” they said.
Zhao ticked off examples of China's new pressures on Pyongyang: “China has stopped coal imports. That's a big step. It's stopped supplying diesel and gas. That's a big step. It has tightened regulations on companies and financial institutions, and the big ones have stopped doing business with North Korea. It's the smaller ones that are motivated by narrow interests and are still doing business. China has enhanced inspections of goods at the border. They made efforts to help private-sector companies strengthen their export-control practices.”
But, importantly, Zhao added that it would be a mistake to misread those steps as China signing on, wholesale, to American efforts to force North Korea to the edge of collapse—a tactic, favored in Washington, known as “strategic strangulation.” “No, it's just balancing Trump and Kim Jong-un,” Zhao said. “The reason China agreed to much tougher sanctions is to calm Trump down.” China has strategic tensions of its own with the U.S., so it is keeping both countries off balance. “It's basically, ‘Who is the bigger evil?' For China, the U.S. is always the top geostrategic concern, the top threat.”
Zhao notes that the U.N. sanctions against North Korea that were passed on August 5th, which China supported, stopped short of seeking to undermine trade and humanitarian activities. “They are trying to draw a line between North Korea's military program and civilian trade. To put more pressure on North Korea, without undermining it. China has been taking the incremental approach,” they said. In Zhao's view, even though China has agreed to limit oil exports to North Korea, it is unlikely to cut them off entirely, which the Trump Administration believes is a vital step to change Kim's behavior. “If China remains the sole supplier, meaning Russia won't step in, I think China would find it very hard to do that,” Zhao said.
There are hard limits to China's willingness to advance American interests in Asia, because the two powers have deep disagreements—about trade, contested territory in the South China Sea, and Taiwan. As the North Korea crisis has escalated, China has urged the U.S. to consider offering North Korea a deal known as “freeze for freeze,” in which the North would halt further tests if the U.S. halts or reduces joint military exercises with South Korea and Japan—exercises that China resents as well. “I think some Chinese are secretly hoping the North Korean position can actually help drive the U.S. forces away from the Korean Peninsula,” Zhao said. “It is in China's interest if, in the mid-to-long term, the North Koreans can have a deal with the United States where the U.S. reduces troops or reduces its exercises.”
In recent years, overly hopeful U.S. politicians and commentators have repeatedly misunderstood China's views of North Korea and assumed that Beijing was, at last, turning against its irksome ally. In private meetings with President Obama, and later with President Trump, Xi has repeated a bottom-line principle about North Korea: “No war. No chaos. No nukes.” A former U.S. official, who was at several of those meetings, told me, “Every American senior official that I know hears, ‘Blah, blah, blah—no nuclear weapons.' And thinks, ‘Oh, we agree! Excellent!' So the Chinese ought to be willing to limbo under this bar for us. But, no, that's third in the list of three strategic priorities. The first two are avoiding war on the Korean Peninsula, and avoiding chaos and collapse.” In that spirit, China has sought to limit the scope of U.S.-backed sanctions in the U.N. Security Council. In the latest round, earlier this month, China succeeded in forcing the U.S. to drop its pursuit of a full oil blockade, which China fears would drive North Korea to collapse.
Nothing worries Chinese officials more than the following scenario: the U.S. uses harsh sanctions and covert action—and possibly military strikes—to drive North Korea close to the point of regime collapse. In turn, Pyongyang lashes out with violence against America or its allies, sparking a full-blown war on China's border, just as China is trying to maintain delicate economic growth and social stability. Xi, in separate sessions, has offered Obama and Trump the same Chinese adage in reference to North Korea: “When a man is barefoot, they don't fear a man with shoes.” In other words, even if attacking America would be suicide for North Korea, if it sees nothing left to lose, it just might do the unthinkable. For that reason, China, above all, wants the U.S. to avoid backing Kim into a corner from which they have no exit.
Trump is fervently seeking China's coöperation, but, ironically, their rhetoric and aggression may be putting that further out of reach. On Sunday, Trump mocked Kim as the “Rocket Man.” Members of their Administration have repeated their openness to “military options,” despite projections that air strikes, or other attempts at targeted attacks, could spark a wider war. Chinese intellectuals have taken to joking that “Telangpu”—which is one of the Chinese pronunciations of Trump's name—sounds like “te meipu,” which means clueless or lacking a plan. In recent months, Trump has alternately praised China and threatened it with a trade war. “I don't understand Trump,” Shen, the historian, told me. “One day they are saying something good about Xi Jinping and the next they are criticizing him. Trump is becoming more and more of a problem. China is becoming more and more stable.”
VHL and MHL in relation to the KHL
When looking into the KHL there are other two Russian leagues that work along with it. In this post I will run through of them and highlight their top scorers, as when looking at a prospects production overseas I always saw points in these three leagues in one year for a player.
********
VHL
Translated to also be known as the Major Hockey League, or Higher Hockey League, the VHL (founded in 2010) is considered to be a step down talentwise from the KHL, housing 26 teams in the league, but is not considered a farm team to the KHL. The confusing part is that the two leagues do work together and transfer players between them, calling them up or down. On each VHL team's roster only a maximum of seven players over the age of 29 are allowed. There are rumours the league could soon become a farm league of the KHL but I cannot confirm that. Many of the top scorers in the VHL are not really on any prospect radar so I will not dive much into them.
VHL top five scorers
Artyom Gordeyev (28 years – F)
In 47 games played for Toros Neftekamsk, Gordeyev has 42 points to lead the league in scoring but cannot seem to stick long term in the KHL.
Stanislav Golovanov (33 years – F)
In 46 games played for the same team above (the team has three players in the top five), Golovanov is a playmaker with 42 points as they have pretty much been a career VHLer.
Anatoli Rayenko (30 years – F)
The forward for Molot-Prikamie Perm has 38 points in 47 games, and has played a majority of their career in the VHL and Russia2/3 leagues.
Igor Cherkasov (25 years – F)
The youngest player in the top five scorers has 37 points in 40 games for Yuzhny Ural Orsk, and has never gotten a crack at the KHL as of yet.
Artur Sarvarov (31 years – F)
Sarvarov has 35 points for Sarayarka Karaganda in 45 games played.

MHL
The Minor or Youth Hockey League was founded in 2009, consists of 39 teams from 7 countries, and a are used as minor league teams for their respective KHL teams and can be minor league teams for other professional leagues like the VHL, BEL, and PHL. Some teams do not even have an affiliated team but are in the league anyway. The fact that the MHL can be an affiliate for the KHL and VHL, while some teams in the VHL can also be affiliates for KHL teams, makes the whole set up confusing when trying to track league affiliations. In the MHL players cannot be 21 and older, and once they are too old for the MHL they must go to one of the other leagues. Highlighted below are the top five point leaders in the MHL, and may be on some NHL radars but it will be tough as none are over six feet tall.
MHL top five scorers
Artyom Manukyan (18 years – F)
Playing for Omskie Yastreby, Manukyan is the youngest player in the top five and leads the league in scoring by 12 points. They have 96 points, 36 of those goals with 60 assists, in only 52 games played. They will be 19 in June and could potentially be a top player for Russia in the upcoming World Junior Championship. Now you (the reader) may be wondering why you have not heard of Maukyan, at least I was, but then I read why. Manukyan is 5'7 and only 139 pounds, making them a very small player. Now they do have the skill, speed, IQ, and elusiveness that NHL teams covet, but they also have the size that many shy away from (and the birth country). If they were to gain some mass to their frame it would be wise of an NHL team to take a chance on this player late in the 2017 draft. They have set the record for point seasons in the MHL with 96, the previous being 94, so there is a ton of skill there. The points separating third place in scoring from 31st are 19 points, now the points separating Manukyan from third place is 37 TOTAL POINTS, if this kid could grow they could be very sought after asset.
Anton Kovalyov (19 years – F)
Kovalyov also plays for Omskie Yastreby and is riding shotgun to Manukyan's hot play. While being no slouch of their own in the skill department, they have 84 points in 48 games, with 39 of those being goals. They have surprisingly never played in any international tournaments despite putting up have a 0.99 point per game average in the MHL. Kovalyov is 5'10 and about 170 pounds, so there is room to grow, but since they are 25 points away from the next highest point producer, they should be getting looks from NHL squads. What seems more likely however is that they play in the KHL next season and within a few seasons you may hear their name.
Andrei Karavayev (19 years – F)
In their fourth season of MHL play for Kuznetskie Medvedi, Karavayev has 59 points in 44 games as their points have increased every season. Standing at 5'9 and 170 pounds, the forward has played in 23 KHL games over the past two seasons tallying only four points with low ice time. Karavayev could spend next season in the MHL or go to the KHL, but they may end up on some NHL teams map in the future.
Konstantin Parkhomenko (20 years – F)
Playing in their final MHL season for Kuznetskie Medvedi, Parkhomenko is playing their best hockey to date. Their previous career high was 17 points, but currently they have 58 points in 43 games. Injuries have been a factor to Parkhomenko's career so far, as they are only 5'8, but this season they are fully healthy and playing up to their potential. Parkhomenko will likely need a few seasons in the KHL before they are ever on an NHL map, but they may be one of those players that never come over as well.
Dmitri Shaburov (20 years – F)
Shaburov has had an interesting career path to say the least in their four years in the MHL for Amurskie Tigry Khabarovsk. In their first season they registered zero points in 43 games, they then preceded that with 36 points in 55 games, 29 points in40 games, and this current season they have 58 points in 50 games as they are carrying the team they have played with through their entire career. At 20 years old and with a good, yet slight, frame to them Shaburov could potentially be a big free agent signing down the line.
Most impressive goalie so far:
Danil Kudashev (20 years – G)
Kudashev has put up great numbers in the MHL since the 2014 season. They have three straight seasons of a plus 0.930 save percentage, including this year where they have a 0.938 save percentage in 34 games played for Sarmaty Orenburg. Previous seasons were with the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl franchise as they were called up last season but never played. Kudashev could be a hidden gem in the Russian leagues as they have good size standing at 6'1, but has never played in the KHL to date. The way Shestyorkin, Sorokin, and Samsonov are all playing in the KHL it will be hard for any other goalie to make a name for themselves but if you can keep a tab on any goalie they may fit that mold.
KHL scoring prospects currently:
TBL – Nikita Gusev has 68 points in 54 games, good for fourth in KHL scoring.
Sought after UFA – Yevgeni (Evgeni) Dadonov has 62 points in 50 games, good for seventh in league scoring.
Min – Kirill Kaprizov has 42 points in 47 games, good for 21st in KHL scoring.
Sought after UFA – Vladimir Tkachyov (the other one) has 39 points in 47 games, good for 24th in league scoring.
CHI – Maxim Shalunov has 36 points in 46 games, good for 34th in league scoring.

On Its 7th Birthday, Is Twitter Still The 'Free Speech Party'?
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images Mohammed Abed/AFP/Getty Images
It's hard to believe, but seven years ago no one had ever heard of a tweet. Thursday is the anniversary of the first tweet from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. It wasn't profound. They wrote:
Since then the social media company has been an important communication tool in everything from the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, to its use as a megaphone for celebrities. Over the years, its relationship to its free speech principles has changed.
From Trivial To Global Town Hall
When it was founded, Twitter seemed rather trivial. I visited the company's tiny San Francisco offices in 2007 and spoke with co-founder Biz Stone. They told me about their first tweet.
"I was at home ripping up old carpet and sweating," they recalled. "It was terrible. It was gross."
Then Stone's phone buzzed in their pocket and they saw a tweet: "Evan Williams is wine tasting in Napa."
Jason Pontin, the editor-in-chief of MIT's Technology Review, recalls that they didn't think Twitter was good for anything more profound than those first tweets.
They say at the time they thought "Twitter was in the business of allowing people to advertise trivialities."
Today, Pontin says they think of Twitter differently, and so do its executives.
"We think of Twitter as the global town hall," says Twitter CEO Dick Costolo. "When you walk into it, there are many things you can do: You can go listen to the musician. You can pick up the news. You can purchase things."
Twitter says it now has more than 200 million active users all over the globe.
'Free Speech Wing Of The Free Speech Party'
Costolo says this hasn't changed Twitter's essential mission.
"We're the free speech wing of the free speech party," they say.
Costolo can point to a lot to back up that statement — from the regular flow of tweets from Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei to Twitter's role in the Arab Spring.
As protesters faced down Egyptian police, they used Twitter to let the world know what was happening.
"If you're in a place like Tahrir Square and bullets are flying around you and you need to quickly get the message out, well, then shooting out a quick text message is certainly one way of doing that," says NPR's Andy Carvin, who used Twitter to amplify the news from Egypt to their Twitter followers. "It made it easy for a critical mass of people to access it when breaking news was happening somewhere."
In the midst of the protests, Twitter was scheduled to power down for site maintenance. But the company got a call from the U.S. State Department asking it to wait because of its crucial role in communication for the democracy movement.
Ironically, Twitter's biggest battles against censorship began in Western democracies. Unlike the U.S., many European countries have laws against hate speech. Last year in France, there was a torrent of anti-Semitic tweets.
"It was written, 'A good Jew is a dead Jew. A good Jew is a burnt Jew. A good Jew doesn't exist.' Things like this," says Elie Petit, the vice president of the European Union of Jewish Students.
Because of anti-Jewish violence in France, Petit's organization went to Twitter and asked that the company follow French law and take down the tweets.
"They didn't react," they say. "So, we decided to sue them."
The French court ordered Twitter to block the anti-Semitic tweets, and Twitter complied, says CEO Costolo.
"We have to abide by the laws in the countries in which we operate," they say. "So the capability we built allows us to block those tweets from being seen in the countries in which they're against the law, while remaining visible to those outside that country."
Costolo says though people won't see the tweets in France, Twitter's software will let them know the accounts are being censored.
But the French court also asked Twitter to turn over the names of the people who sent out the hate tweets. Twitter refused. Pontin of MIT Technology Review says they think Twitter's compromise is full of contradictions.
"To their credit, they're not giving up names and that's great," Pontin says. "But they're no longer compliant with their own little internal rule, which is that they will be locally compliant with law. So they've said, 'We'll be compliant with this part of the laws.' "
Criticism Over Olympics
Twitter also drew fire last year during the Olympics, for which the company had a commercial partnership with NBC. Journalist Guy Adams, a vocal critic of NBC, tweeted the email address of an NBC executive to which Adams' followers could send complaints. A Twitter employee alerted NBC and said it could have Adams' account taken down. NBC did.
Costolo says it's a mistake they won't make again.
"I had a long conversation with that person about the way we think about our users here and that it's not our job to be the editor of what's right and what's wrong and what's good and what's bad on Twitter," Costolo says. "That's for our users to police and report and decide."
Despite the apology, the situation laid bare the problems that Twitter confronts as it balances being a profitable international business and an open media platform. Its aim is to be the place where comedians Steve Martin and Albert Brooks can have a spontaneous conversation, where you can tweet about a bad cup of coffee, and where dissidents can take on the Chinese government.
Costolo says they are aware of the challenges, but they say they believe "creating a platform where people can be safe and can be free to walk into the town square and have the conversations they want to have will ultimately benefit the business more in the long run."
So far, Twitter's export of American-style free speech values is turning out to be a profitable formula. The question going forward is whether Twitter can stay true to its mission of being a beacon of free speech and a commercial success.
A Reddit user who recently canceled their PlayStation Vue free trial received a rather interesting customer satisfaction survey that may shed some light on the future of the streaming service.
The survey asked one primary question: Would you choose to continue the service if Vue lowered its price, added this channel, etc.
The user can then say, “Lowering it by $5 has no impact,” or, “Adding ABC would make me more likely to subscribe.”
It was the next section that included a very interesting question, which we outlined in a red box:
Could PlayStation Vue be seriously trying to add NFL Network and MLB Network?
The latter would make more sense, being that the MLB already offers a season-long streaming package, although in-market games are blacked out. So, if you're a Detroit Tigers fan living in Michigan, you're out of luck.
As for NFL Network? Maybe.
Vue's biggest competitor is Sling TV, which is priced $10 less per month, doesn't offer the NFL Network or NFL Redzone right now. The only way to stream the 24/7 football network is to have a pay TV subscription and authenticate that service through the app.
The NFL is a goliath that doesn't hand out broadcasting or streaming rights to just anyone. It did, however, ink a deal with Twitter earlier this month to stream Thursday night games.
Sony also hints at the fact that they're looking into adding local sports — something that becomes even more difficult due to large broadcast contracts and rights. Sony has said it's working to obtain streaming rights for local programming from network-affiliated stations, but dealing with a Fox Sports Detroit or a YES Network (the station of the New York Yankees) is a different story.
NFL, MLB and even NBA network channels are really the only holes in PlayStation Vue, which does offer plans as expensive as $45 per month. As more people cut the cord — and they will — expect more pressure from those sports leagues to make their content available through such streaming services.

The fifth wave of EU accession consisted of 10 new members in 2004 - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia - and 2 new members in 2007 - Bulgaria and Romania.
Only two out of the previewed 115 EU-ambassadors in the new External Action Service are going to come from the 12 countries that joined the Union post-2004, according to information by Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
The Rzeczpospolita information, quoted by the Bulgarian News Agency, is based on a report of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, stating that 113 of the 115 future EU-ambassadors will be coming from the 15 pre-2004 member states, with one from Lithuania and one from Hungary.
Of course, if true, that would mean that Bulgaria will be among ten new member states without their representative in the ambassador position.
Poland has consistently called for a fair representation of member states in the EU External Action Service.
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton, who will head the service, has announced that around 30 EU ambassadors will be appointed in September.
Naughty Dog's globe-trotting hero returns to action on 7th October
Every great adventure is made up of legendary tales. Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection packs three thrilling adventures into one amazing collection. Nathan Drake has grown from man to legend as their story permeated our studio DNA and PlayStation lore. Here's a glimpse of that transformation:
The exchange seen here between Sully and Drake is a defining moment in the Uncharted story. Sir Francis Drake's motto “Greatness from small beginnings” has a special place in Nathan Drake's backstory and frames their epic journeys. They achieved greatness from humble beginnings with a lot of help along the way. Sully became a father-figure and mentor of sorts for Nate and that relationship served as a rock in the often wild, always adventurous saga that you'll play in Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.
Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is the culmination of years of hard work at our studio, lovingly rebuilt by the team at Bluepoint Games. It's incredible to watch Drake run, leap and shoot on the PS4 with enhanced graphics and gameplay.
Capturing those white-knuckle, trademark Uncharted moments has never been more fun than via the new Photo Mode tools built into the collection. Various improvements in lighting, rendering, texture mapping and dynamic audio mean all three games are looking and sounding better than ever.
New trophies and modes such as our Explorer, Speed Run, and Brutal Modes will invite long-time adventurers to replay these classics while welcoming newcomers to discover Uncharted greatness.
Explorer Mode is an all-new mode for beginners where combat difficulty is reduced greatly.

The closing ceremony of the Delhi Commonwealth Games (CWG) took place in October 2010. On paper, though, the Games will close this month. Twelve years after it was formed, the sports ministry, on the intervention of Prime Minister's Office (PMO), has decided to dissolve the CWG Organising Committee (OC). The decision was approved by sports minister Vijay Goel on Friday and a month's notice has been issued to the OC staff.
Advertising
The committee, which employs 19 people, including a CEO, is facing 42 cases of outstanding payments to the tune of approximately Rs 700 crore. The liability will now shift to the government, which is likely to form an OC cell within the sports ministry to monitor these cases. Roughly five of these cases, a source said, are worth Rs 50-60 crore each.
One of the key reasons for disbanding the OC is its operational cost. Last year, sources said the government spent Rs 2.25 crore only to pay salaries of the staff. Other major expenses included housekeeping (Rs 45 lakh), vehicles (Rs 30 lakh), security (Rs 25 lakh) and telephone (Rs 16 lakh). However, the government spent most on legal fees, which amounted to Rs 4.65 crore.
“The OC was assisting various agencies in cases related to the CWG. But the arbitration process has been long and the costs were adding up. Also, we do not know how long these cases will last. So, it was decided that they will be taken into the government fold,” a sports ministry official said.
Most countries dissolve the OC within a year or two of the conclusion of the Games and it is mostly to nurture the sporting legacy the spectacle leaves behind. But the process in India has historically been slow – the 1982 Asian Games Organising Committee was disbanded just last year, in January.
As for CWG 2010, the pile of court and arbitration cases resulted in the committee being around for so long. “The PMO wanted to disband the CWG OC by December 2016, but that could not be done due to the ongoing legal hassles,” the official said.
The OC, which was formed in February 2005, itself was embroiled in various controversies. Its chairperson, Suresh Kalmadi, and secretary general, Lalit Bhanot, were both sent to prison after being accused of financial irregularities. Kalmadi even blamed OC CEO Jarnail Singh for awarding contracts to a few companies but their name was not included in the chargesheet.

Jarnail is likely to be a part of the OC cell to assist the ministry through the arbitration process. “This will help the government in directly controlling the cases which are under arbitration instead of doing it via the OC. It will also expedite the process,” the official said.

Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez (born March 19, 1943) is a Mexican-born American chemist known for their pivotal role in the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. They were a co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their role in elucidating the threat to the Earth's ozone layer of chlorofluorocarbon gases (or CFCs). They became the first Mexican-born citizen to ever receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[8]
In 2004 Molina accepted the positions of professor at the University of California, San Diego and the Center for Atmospheric Sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Molina is also Director of the Mario Molina Center for Energy and Environment in Mexico City. Molina is a climate policy adviser to President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto.[9]
Biography [ edit ]
Molina is the son of Roberto Molina-Pasquel, a lawyer and judge who went on to serve as chief Ambassador to Ethiopia, Australia and the Philippines in 1923,[1] and Leonor Henríquez. As a child they converted a bathroom into their own little laboratory, using toy microscopes and chemistry sets. They looked up to their aunt Esther Molina, who was a chemist, and who helped them with their experiments.[10]
After completing their basic studies in Mexico City and at the Institut auf dem Rosenberg in Switzerland[1][11] they earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1965. In 1967 they earned their postgraduate degree in polymerization kinetics at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, West Germany, and in 1972 a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, working with George Pimentel.[6][7] Molina married chemist Luisa Y. Tan in July 1973. They moved to Irvine, California that fall.[12]
In 1974, as a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Irvine, they and Rowland co-authored a paper in the journal Nature highlighting the threat of CFCs to the ozone layer in the stratosphere.[13] At the time, CFCs were widely used as chemical propellants and refrigerants. Molina and Rowland followed up the short Nature paper with a 150-page report for the AEC, which they made available at the September 1974 meeting of the American Chemical Society in Atlantic City. This report and an ACS-organized press conference, in which they called for a complete ban on further releases of CFCs into the atmosphere, brought national attention.[14]
Rowland and Molina's findings were disputed by commercial manufacturers and chemical industry groups, and a public consensus on the need for action only began to emerge in 1976 with the publication of a review of the science by the National Academy of Sciences. Rowland and Molina's work was further supported by evidence of the long-term decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica, published by Joseph C. Farman and their co-authors in Nature in 1985. Ongoing work led to the adoption of the Montreal Protocol (an agreement to cut CFC production and use) by 56 countries in 1987, and to further steps towards the worldwide elimination of CFCs from aerosol cans and refrigerators. It is for this work that Molina later shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[15] Molina was one of twenty-two Nobel Laureates who signed the third Humanist Manifesto in 2003.[16]
Between 1974 and 2004 Molina variously held research and teaching posts at University of California, Irvine, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where they held a joint appointment in the Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and the Department of Chemistry.[6] On July 1, 2004 Molina joined the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at University of California, San Diego and the Center for Atmospheric Sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.[17] In addition they established a non-profit organization, which opened the Mario Molina Center for Strategic Studies in Energy and the Environment (Centro Mario Molina para Estudios Estratégicos sobre Energía y Medio Ambiente) in Mexico City in 2005. Mario Molina serves as its director.[18]
Molina served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 2000-2005.[19] They also served on the board of directors of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (2004-2014),[20] and as a member of the MacArthur Foundation's Institutional Policy Committee and its Committee on Global Security and Sustainability.[21]
Molina was nominated to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences as of July 24, 2000.[22] They served as a co-chair of the Vatican workshop and report Well Under 2 Degrees Celsius: Fast Action Policies to Protect People and the Planet from Extreme Climate Change (2017) with Veerabhadran Ramanathan and Durwood Zaelke. The report proposed 12 scalable and practical solutions which are part of a three-lever cooling strategy to mitigate climate change.[23][24]
Molina was named by U.S. President Barack Obama to form a transition team on environmental issues in 2008.[25] Under President Obama, they were a member of the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[26]
Molina and their first wife, Luisa T. Molina, are divorced. Luisa Tan Molina is the lead scientist of the Molina Center for Strategic Studies in Energy and the Environment in La Jolla, California.[27] Their son works as a physician in Boston.[1] Mario Molina married their second wife, Guadalupe Álvarez, in February 2006.[1]
Dr. Molina currently sits on the board of directors for Xyleco[28]
Their discovery [ edit ]
Mario Molina joined the lab of Professor F. Sherwood Rowland in 1973 as a postdoctoral fellow. Here, Molina continued Rowland's pioneering research into "hot atom" chemistry, which is the study of chemical properties of atoms with, and only with, excess translational energy owing to radioactive processes.[10][29]
This study soon led to research into chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), apparently harmless gases that were used in refrigerants, aerosol sprays, and the making of plastic foams.[30] CFCs were being released by human activity and were known to be accumulating in the atmosphere. The basic scientific question Molina asked was "What is the consequence of society releasing something to the environment that wasn't there before?"[29]
Rowland and Molina had investigated compounds similar to CFCs before. Together they developed the CFC ozone depletion theory, by combining basic scientific knowledge about the chemistry of ozone, CFCs and atmospheric conditions with computer modelling. First Molina tried to figure out how CFCs could be decomposed. At lower levels of the atmosphere, they were inert. Molina realized that if CFCs released into the atmosphere do not decay by other processes, they will continually rise to higher altitudes. Higher in the atmosphere, different conditions apply. The highest levels of the stratosphere are exposed to the sun's ultraviolet light. A thin layer of ozone floating high in the stratosphere protects lower levels of the atmosphere from that type of radiation.[30]
Molina theorized that photons from ultraviolet light, known to break down oxygen molecules, could also break down CFCs, releasing a number of products including chlorine atoms into the stratosphere. Chlorine atoms (Cl) are radicals: they have an unpaired electron and are very reactive. Chlorine atoms react easily with ozone molecules (O 3 ), removing one oxygen atom to leave O 2 and chlorine monoxide (ClO).[30][31]
Cl· + O
3 → ClO· + O
2
ClO is also a radical, which reacts with ozone to release two O 2 molecules and a Cl atom. The radical Cl atom is not consumed in these reactions, so it remains in the system.[30][31]
ClO· + O· → Cl· + O
2
Molina and Rowland predicted that chlorine atoms, produced by this decomposition of CFCs, would act as an ongoing catalyst for the destruction of ozone. When they calculated the amounts involved they realized that CFCs could start a seriously damaging chain reaction to the ozone layer in the stratosphere.[15][10][29]
Rowland and Molina published their findings in Nature on June 28, 1974, and also made an effort to announce their findings outside of the scientific community, informing policymakers and the news media of their work. As a result of their work, laws were established to protect the ozone layer by regulating the use of CFCs.[10][29]
Honors [ edit ]
Mario Molina has received numerous awards and honors,[6][7] including sharing the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul J. Crutzen and F. Sherwood Rowland for their discovery of the role of CFCs in ozone depletion.[2]
Molina was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1993.[32] They were elected to the United States Institute of Medicine in 1996,[33] and The National College of Mexico in 2003.[34]  They are also a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences.[6] Molina is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and co-chaired the 2014 AAAS Climate Science Panel, What We Know: The reality, risks and response to climate change.[35]
Molina won the 1987 Esselen Award of the Northeast section of the American Chemical Society, the 1988 Newcomb Cleveland Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the 1989 NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Advancement and the 1989 United Nations Environmental Programme Global 500 Award. In 1990, The Pew Charitable Trusts Scholars Program in Conservation and the Environment honored them as one of ten environmental scientists and awarded them a $150,000 grant.[6][36][37] They received the 1998 Willard Gibbs Award from the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society[38] and the 1998 American Chemical Society Prize for Creative Advances in Environment Technology and Science[39]. In 2003, Molina received the 9th Annual Heinz Award in the Environment.
Asteroid 9680 Molina is named in their honor.[40]
On August 8, 2013, President Barack Obama announced Molina as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom,[41] citing in the press release:
Mario Molina is a visionary chemist and environmental scientist. Born in Mexico, Dr. Molina came to America to pursue their graduate degree. They later earned the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering how chlorofluorocarbons deplete the ozone layer. Dr. Molina is a professor at the University of California, San Diego; Director of the Mario Molina Center for Energy and Environment; and a member of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[5]

Technical Reports:
It has been too long since my last visit to Epcot's Tangierine Cafe. (Yep, that's spelled correctly. It's like a play on words, right? Tangiers, Morocco — Tangierine? Get it? OK, moving on.)
My absence from this spot recently is kind of shocking, since it's always voted some of the best and most interesting counter service food that you can get anywhere in Walt Disney World.
Located right on the promenade in the Morocco Pavilion, Tangierine Cafe offers an immersive atmosphere and good food with the ring of authenticity. Or at least, that's always been my experience before.
Atmosphere
Tangierine Cafe is very photogenic. The whole Morocco pavilion is gorgeous, and this is no exception.
Once inside, you'll find a cafeteria-style ordering area, and limited seating.
As you probably know, the construction of the Morocco Pavilion was sponsored by the government of Morocco; the design was overseen by King Hassan II himself! And so, the intricate decor and detail you see here represent design details authentic to Moroccan ideals.
Zellige tile, colored glass, and beautiful light fixtures punctuate the space and transport you to your exotic destination.
Choose a seat inside, or enjoy lunch on the outdoor terrace that's off to the side of the front entrance. It provides an excellent vantage for people watching.
There's also a wonderful little room in the back of the space, set apart from the high-celinged main dining room. Since it's rather hidden, sometimes you'll find it empty. It's a great spot to take a break from the Epcot crowds.
Additional outdoor seating, with umbrella-shaded tables, is available on the other side of the restaurant.
Back inside, you'll make your selections and await your food. Beverage options include a few Moroccan beers, which are available by the bottle, in addition to standard soft drink options.
You'll find another hidden gem in the back of the restaurant, near the cash register. A bar devoted to Coffee and Pastries demands a little of your time. This is also the home of some of those delicious and refreshing Grown Up Slushies that we've told you about before.
In the case, you'll find some authentic Moroccan pastries here, including different varieties of Baklava as well as Semolina Cookies, and Almond Pastries, and other house specialties.
You'll also find standard options, like Cookies and Muffins.
Eats
After a light breakfast, I was definitely ready for something substantial for lunch. And you'll find hearty portions at Tangierine Cafe, even though the menu features some better-for-you options.
The menu for Speciality Coffees and Drinks is located over the Coffee and Pastry Bar, so be sure to check it out as well.
If you're inclined, I can definitely recommend that you start your meal with one of Tangierine's Daiquiris, or Grown Up Slushies!
My friend decided to give the Vegetarian Platter a try. This substantial plate of food is a DFB Favorite recommendation for a hearty meatless meal!
The plate includes Couscous, Lentils, Tabbouleh, Hummus, Marinated Olives, and Falafel, accompanied by Moroccan Bread.
The Falafel — deep-fried patties of Pureed Chickpeas — are served on a bed of Shredded Lettuce and garnished with Onions. They're flavorful, but my friend and I were both turned off by the “stale” hard texture. Perhaps it was because we were eating a bit later at night?
I decided to stick with one of my favorites — the Chicken Shawarma Platter.
Shawarma is basically a term for meat slow-roasted on a spit, and then shaved off. You'll find a variety of meats prepared this way, including Chicken and Lamb. If you're familiar with the meat on Greek Gyros, then you have the basic concept.
Well, Chicken doesn't so much…shave. 😉 So instead, you have pieces of Roasted Chicken, seasoned with exotic herbs and spices. The platter is served with Moroccan Bread, Couscous, Tabbouleh, and Hummus. Taziki, a rich yogurt-based condiment, tops the Chicken, along with Marinated Onions. (Warning! Cilantro in abundance!)
Another friend opted for the Moroccan Kefta Sandwich, which comes with a less traditional side of French Fries.
Kefta are Meatballs, normally made of ground Beef or Lamb (or a combination.) Here, they're served wrapped in a Pita, and accompanied by a lightly dressed salad of Shredded Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Onions. The combination of flavors from the meat and the light dressing provide a nice introduction to the seasonings of Morocco. I think this would be a great option for someone who is interested in trying Middle Eastern or North African food for the first time.
Unfortunately, the french fries were…horrible. I'd heard great things about the fries here for some reason, but ours were worse than bad. Again, perhaps because we were eating rather late in the day.
Overall
I hear it all the time from you guys and I completely agree — Tangierine Cafe is something very special. I regret dining there very late, as I think we didn't give the place a fair shake heading in when the park was about to close. But, then again, I could take the stance that a restaurant's food should be consistently good regardless of when you dine, right?
That said, my complaints about the three dishes were minimal; and this place still does really offer some of the best and most “exotic” counter service fare in Disney World. It has been a reliable meal option for as long as I can remember.
One weak spot — and actually, I'd say the same for the other Morocco restaurants, Spice Road Table and Restaurant Marrakesh — is the Kids' Meals. Hamburgers and Chicken Nuggets/Fingers are the choices here, and that's a shame. While I understand they have to be available for the picky eaters, I'm very confident that some children would welcome the opportunity to try more authentic fare.
Now it's time to hear from all of you Tangierine Fans. Tell us what you love about Tangierine Cafe in comments below!
A rare original copy of the Easter 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic went up for auction. at Sotheby's in London, on Tuesday. It was expected to sell for somewhere in the range of £80,000 to £120,000 ($120,000 - $184,000).
Instead it went for an incredible £305,000 ($460,000)—£250,000 plus buyer's fees etc.—in a sale that defied all expectations. It went to an unidentified buyer who bid by telephone.
This particular copy has never appeared on the market before and was acquired by Sotheby's in London from a descendant of the original owner, who was a Dublin resident at the time of the 1916 Rising.
Although unsigned, the document is still one of just 50 existing copies of the Proclamation, a historical document that Sotheby's describe as the “most important document in the history of the Irish Nation.”
It is believed that 1,000 copies of the Proclamation were originally printed in Liberty Hall in 1916, most of which were lost during the events of the Rising. There are now an estimated 50 surviving copies, 25 of which are in museums and the rest of which are privately owned.
The document, 30 inches by 20 inches in size, is housed in a specially made portfolio box and has sustained minimal wear and tear with some creases along vertical and horizontal folds.
Ireland is now just two weeks away from the beginning of centenary celebrations of the 1916 Easter Rising, a year-long commemoration of what is generally seen as the greatest single event in the struggle for Irish independence.
The 1916 Proclamation was read from the steps of the GPO on Sackville (now O'Connell) Street on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916, by Pádraig Pearse, a leader of the Easter Rising and one of the seven signatories of the Proclamation. The other signatories included Thomas J. Clarke, Seán Mac Diarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Eamonn Ceannt, James Connolly and Joseph Plunkett.
It is believed Pearse wrote the document, described by Sotheby's as “as a moving symbol of the violent events of Easter week 1916 and those terrible days,” with amendments possibly made by the labor leader Connolly and McDonagh, who is widely regarded as the mastermind behind the Rising.
“Pearse themselves was a poet and writer,” writes Sotheby's, “and the text mingles lofty, deftly expressed idealism with Christian Socialist principles.”
Unfortunately, the original document did not survive the destruction of Easter Week 1916.
The leaders had originally planned to print 2,500 copies of the document in Liberty Hall, but difficulties in its printing meant that only 1,000 were eventually produced. Many of those copies were lost when Liberty Hall was stormed by the British.
These copies of the Proclamation were produced by three men: Christopher Brady, the printer, and two compositors, Michael Molloy and Liam O'Brien. It is reported that the men were essentially kept under arrest by Pearse so that it would appear they were working under duress if the base was stormed by the British Army.
Next year will see several 1916-related auctions taking place in Ireland and, as such, this Sotheby's auction and the success of the sale of this Proclamation will have been closely watched by Irish auctioneers as a sign of how Easter Rising historical memorabilia will fare at auction in 2016.
The popularity of copies of the proclamation at auction has varied through the years, reaching its peak during the years of the Celtic Tiger. The selling price also varies depending on whether the document is signed or not. Several copies had been signed by its printers, while others were signed by several rebels.
In the past ten years, six copies of the Proclamation have appeared in auction, with various levels of success. Just last year, a copy was sold for €90,000 ($98,000) at Adam's in Dublin having previously fetched €240,000 ($262,000) at the same auction house in 2007.
The highest price ever reached for a copy of the Easter Rising Proclamation was €390,000 ($426,000) for a document sold in Dublin in 2004, the height of the boom years in Ireland.
Mom 'Looking Over Shoulder' After Cop-Husband Convicted of Framing Them
The ex-wife of a disgraced Texas police officer who has been sentenced to 30 days in jail and five years probation for framing them on drug charges said today they are glad the "nightmare" is over but said, "I will always be looking over my shoulder."
"If anyone would have ever told me I would have drugs planted on me by my ex-husband, another police officer and a local criminal, I would have never believed them," Laura Covington told ABC News today.
Them former husband, Madisonville police Sgt. Jeffrey Covington, was convicted last week of retaliation for planting methamphetamines in Laura Covington's car in 2011 during a child custody battle. The drugs were found after they were stopped by police and they were promptly jailed.

The terms of Jeffrey Covington's sentencing, which occurred Monday, include 30 days in jail, five years probation, and the surrender of their peace officer's license, according to ABC News affiliate KTRK TV.
The court determined that Jeffrey Covington and a second police officer arranged with a third person to plant drugs in Laura Covington's vehicle. They were seven months pregnant when they were arrested and their two children were taken away from them for five weeks.
"Being arrested when I was seven months pregnant, going to jail, and then having my two young children taken from me was a nightmare that still causes me pain to this day," they told ABC News. "It's like a bad dream, but the sad thing is that it's not a dream because it actually happened."
"Having my babies taken from me was the worst part about this entire ordeal and if Jeff had succeeded in their scheme, I could have lost them forever. My family and I will move on, but I will always be looking over my shoulder," Laura Covington said.
Laura Covington's attorney Paxton Adams has filed civil rights lawsuit in federal court as well.
Jeffrey Covington could not be immediately reached for comment.
The police officer who allegedly helped Jeffrey Covington is scheduled to go on trial later this month.
Dear Stash,
Many thanks for your note and all the wonderful gifts. Our mummy was apparently brought to tears at work when they opened it - but we wouldn't know. We were at home lounging in the sun.
The portrait of us is spot-on. We knew we were gorgeous, but now we can gaze upon our beauteous faces without being scared of the mirror. Plus, mummy and daddy are always taking our pictures so maybe this will stop them for awhile.
The toys are an absolute delight! As you can see in the video we directed mummy to make, the robotic bug was confusing at first - but has quickly become a favorite past time.
One of us (Edie) has taken to making mummy throw the feathery mouse for fetch while the other (Diego) guards the sparkly balls carefully.
It's not a red-letter day today so we refused to let mummy put the bows on us despite their best efforts.  They are only allowed special occasions to make us look silly, which we will tolerate for about 10 minutes.
Mummy also was seen to put that little wooden thing in their bag. I, Diego, tried to chew it but it was not to my palate.
We cherish the thought of another feline friend so far away and hope that your humans spoil you for all the joy you have allowed them to send to us here in Hong Kong.
All the headbutts and chin rubs to you,
Diego & Edie
ISTANBUL – Former Rockets' center Omer Asik said that they were going to miss Houston and was grateful for their time with the Rockets.
Asik, the only NBA player on the Turkish national team, is preparing for the FIBA World Championships taking place later this month in Spain.
Just before coming back to Turkey this summer, they found out they would be traded to the New Orleans Pelicans. Asik said they were excited about the opportunity and that they would miss the people in the Rockets organization and their teammates.
They said there were no hard feelings toward the franchise despite the early season drama that surrounded the team's acquisition of Dwight Howard. Asik, a former starter, had been made a backup to Howard and then suffered a series of leg injuries. Despite the tough year, they were key in the postseason, starting alongside Howard against the Blazers and giving the Rockets the “twin towers” look that they were after when the season started.
Asik said that their experience with the Rockets has helped make them a better player. They said they would miss the coaching and the fans.
“I just really want to thank all the fans and all the support I had in Houston,” they said. “I want to thank everyone in the organization and especially my teammates. I really enjoyed my time in Houston.”
Before Asik puts on a Pelicans jersey, they will compete with Turkey in the championships. The first games start Aug. 30 and Turkey will face the United States in the second game of the tournament. The top two teams from each group will advance to the next round.
“I am just excited to play in the games,” Asik said. “Last time (2010), it was in Turkey and we made it all the way to the final (before losing to the U.S.). It was a lot of fun to play.”
They said the globalization of the game of basketball has grown a lot since they started playing. They will play against several other NBA players during the championships because so many international players play in the NBA and for their countries.
“It's crazy because for example, Spain has six or seven NBA players on their team,” they said. “I think Europe and the NBA are becoming closer since NBA players are playing more on their international teams.”
Although the game is becoming more global, there are still a lot of technical differences in the actual sport.
Asik said that the NBA game is much quicker than what they see in Europe.
“It isn't as fast as the NBA because it is mostly set to set – not as many fast breaks and transitions so it slows down, but of course the experience I have in the NBA helps me a lot here,” Asik said.
OREM, UTAH — Washington insiders would pick America's next President under the dream scheme of the #NeverTrump movement. Their plan is sinister: If even one state backs a third-party candidate, it could enable Congress to pick the next President instead of the voters.
People may think they're protesting by backing someone other than Trump or Clinton, but instead may play into the hands of this #NeverTrump scheme to empower Washington insiders.
How does it work? This plan was proposed by Glenn Beck Show head writer Stu Burguiere; incredibly it centers on deep-red Utah and then radiates out to other states. The goal is not to win in November but to deny both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton a majority in the Electoral College. Then victory comes by shifting control to Washington.
Under the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, the House of Representatives would pick the President from among the top three electoral finishers; the Vice-President would be chosen by the U.S. Senate. The ultimate Washington, D.C., insiders would be in charge, namely the Congress.
Should Congress fail to decide, the Speaker of the House by law becomes President. Because the House would vote by states, not as individuals, the chances of a deadlock are increased by any tie votes within state delegations as well as by backroom dealings.
The politicking would be intense just like the only other time this happened. In 1824, Andrew Jackson had the most popular and Electoral College votes but not a majority. Speaker Henry Clay maneuvered the House of Representatives into choosing John Quincy Adams, who had received only 31% of the popular vote. Adams rewarded Clay with the Secretary of State position; Clay considered that job their stepping-stone to the White House, just as Hillary Clinton now hopes it will be for them
Could history repeat itself? Yes, if 2016 is as close as the race in 2000. George W. Bush won by a razor-thin 271 electoral votes (with 270 required out of 538 total). Each state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, so if any state had gone for neither Bush nor Al Gore, the 2000 election likewise would have gone to the U.S. House.
In the Trump-Clinton match-up, a third candidate's win in a single state could shift the race into the House. The #NeverTrump movement is packed with inside-the-Beltway power players who have proven their ability to influence Congress. Would a Republican majority be trustworthy to resist pressure? Or would this be a re-play of its failures to fight against Obama?
The plan's first step is to win at least one state. Candidate recruitment focused on Utah with its 6 electoral votes and polls showing both Clinton and Trump only around 35%. A home-state alternative was recruited and announced on August 8th. Evan McMullin is a Utahn, Mormon, former CIA officer, former Goldman Sachs investment banker and former Congressional staffer all rolled into one. One poll shows them suddenly at 9% in Utah. He's been gifted with a flurry of favorable national media attention that has the earmarks of an orchestrated effort. A push is underway to get a Mitt Romney endorsement for McMullin.
As the Washington Post reports, “The people who drafted McMullin to be the “Never Trump” independent candidate are some of the Republican establishment's most well-known operatives: Bill Kristol, John Kingston, Joel Searby, Rick Wilson.”
News reports indicate McMullin is already on the Presidential ballot in Utah, Iowa, Louisiana, Colorado and Minnesota. They say they plan to sue Texas for a ballot slot. And ballot qualifying deadlines are still ahead for ten more states.
The “let's-let-Congress-decide” plan only needs one state, but Burguiere's published plan (which they call #Bailout2016) describes the attainable target states are first and foremost Utah, followed by Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, Louisiana, and Kentucky.
Three other alternatives are on the ballots in 21 states apiece, namely Libertarian Gary Johnson, the Green Party's Jill Stein, and the Constitution Party's Darrell Castle. But none of those have McMullin's Beehive State advantage of being both a Utahn and a Mormon, plus those Washington and Wall Street connections which make them attractive to the #NeverTrump plan.
Trump fared poorly in Utah's Republican primary and the state party establishment is not unitedly behind him. Governor Gary Herbert, Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes and Senator Orrin Hatch are with Trump. Senator Mike Lee has withheld any such announcement. Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox says they do not plan to vote for Trump.
The crucial question is how many people are willing to throw away their votes? Millions of Americans yearn to show their disgust with Washington. That righteous anger has powered the Trump phenomena. But voting for a third-party candidate could be America's biggest backfire. Electing Hillary Clinton would be tragic, but letting Washington insiders pick our next President would be the ultimate betrayal of the American people.
Former Congressman Ernest Istook teaches political science at Utah Valley University, the largest school in Utah. They also are president of Americans for Less Regulation.

Making PP Open is something I've advocated for myself, due to what it is and how it's meant to work, it's the only logical thing to me. And that's not a popular idea by any means, so it's highly unlikely to ever happen, so..we get the ideas like Sandro proposed, it'll fix the real imbalance IF enough people go for it, otherwise, that imbalance will remain, it's just far too easy to do PP in Solo/Group without facing any opposition for the exact same rewards that Open gets, so why bother?

(WTVC) -- A Georgia police officer and their colleague have been suspended after they used foul language to discipline some rowdy students.
The local police chief says they usually keep things like these under wraps, but says they felt the community needed to know what happened.
It started with a 911 call made by a bus driver when more than 50 kids on their bus were out of control and they couldn't focus on driving.
The officer who responded boarded the bus. Video captured them cursing as they addressed the students, although they ultimately remained calm.
"What if (the driver) flips the bus over or hits somebody? You think it's (expletive) funny? ... You're hiding your face. Look at me like a man. You wanna grow up and be a man? Look at me like a (expletive) man. ... (The driver has) no tolerance for this (expletive) because they expect more out of 12, 13, 14 year olds," were a few of the things they said.
Meanwhile, outside of the bus, investigators said another officer was swearing at a student who was pulled aside, but that part was not caught on tape.
The two officers involved were assigned to complete 40 hours of community service.
They will also complete additional training on verbal communication.

Legendary journalist Carl Bernstein on Tuesday called conservative website Drudge Report an “alternate universe” that helps lead “a big part of the electorate.”
Bernstein, best known for their coverage of Watergate in the 1970s, told CNN that Matt Drudge's website and other key players in conservative media have played a landmark role in the 2016 race.
"The alternative universe of Drudge, alt-right, the different press and social media that we have seen almost dominate to some extent a big part of the electorate is a wholly new phenomenon," explained Bernstein, 74.
In July, Bernstein called Drudge a "kingmaker" that helped power Trump's rise to the GOP presidential nomination. Drudge regularly has averaged more than 1.5 billion page views per month in recent months.
"Drudge is really a great new factor in this election in terms of media," Bernstein said on CNN. “That site has been unapologetically in Trump's pocket from the beginning.
"And I would say a large measure of why Donald Trump is the nominee goes to Matt Drudge in much the way that Fox has — when you use the word kingmaker, I'm not sure it goes quite far that way, but it is an influence unequalled."
A teenage boy has been arrested after a spate of racist graffiti targeting religious communities across Ottawa, police chief Charles Bordeleau confirmed Saturday during a solidarity event at a synagogue that was defaced earlier this week.
The youth appeared in court this morning to face several charges, including uttering threats and mischief to religious buildings.
Bordeleau said the suspect was caught after a Jewish community centre in west Ottawa was defaced overnight — the sixth incident of racist graffiti in less than a week.
"We recognize the impact that this type of crime has on the broader community and hopefully (the arrest) will help bring it to a conclusion," they said, adding that the "community can demonstrate that unity will overshadow these individual acts of hate."
Staff-Sgt. Jamie Harper said the teen was charged in relation to incidents across the city but could not confirm which specific cases. The teen's age was not released.
A mosque and a church with a pastor who is black were spray-painted with racist graffiti on Friday, after two synagogues and a Jewish prayer centre were defaced with anti-Semitic messages earlier in the week.
On Saturday morning, the Machzikei Hadas Synagogue in south Ottawa opened its doors to 600 people to gather in solidarity against the hateful messages, which included swastikas, racial slurs and pro-Hitler symbols. All the messages were painted in red.
​Premier Kathleen Wynne, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson and Ontario Attorney General Yasir Naqvi, along with several religious figures, attended the event.
"Words of concern and empathy are more powerful than graffiti. Expressions of love are more potent than expressions of hate," the crowd said in unison, as part of a solidarity statement during the event.
Police said Friday that surveillance video footage was part of the investigation.
​No other details about the suspect were immediately available.

Marco Melandri got their hands on the Aruba Ducati World Superbike they will campaign in next year's championship for the first time at a Misano test which ended today.
The mercurial Italian, who replaces Davide Giugliano, spent three days at the circuit with Chaz Davies and the outgoing Roman and says they were impressed with the front-end of the Panigale and that it suits their riding style.
“It was a very emotional moment for me to return to the track on a Superbike. We worked methodically, progressively getting back in the groove and trying first of all to find the right position on the bike. Then, we tested different chassis and electronics configurations to understand how the bike reacts,” said Melandri.
“I was really impressed by the precision of the front, which is crucial for my riding style. Even without paying much attention to the lap times, we were faster than our expectations. Now I'll focus on my training program ahead of the next tests.”
Unsurprisingly, no laptimes were forthcoming but Giugliano ended on a 1'34.9 while Davies was three tenths faster after suffering a muscle strain on day one and ending their programme at lunchtime today after having yesterday off.
“We started off in the right direction on Monday, lapping immediately faster than during the race, but then I felt a muscle strain and I preferred to consult the medical staff at the track, which was very kind and helpful, before stepping back on the bike,” said the Welshman.
“Thankfully it was not a serious issue, I recovered quickly and today we were able to try some important things and collect data. Our base has improved compared with the last few rounds, I'm happier and more confident so I look forward to getting back to racing.”

Climate change has not been strongly influenced by variations in heat from the sun, a new scientific study shows.
The findings overturn a widely held scientific view that lengthy periods of warm and cold weather in the past might have been caused by periodic fluctuations in solar activity.
Research examining the causes of climate change in the northern hemisphere over the past 1000 years has shown that until the year 1800, the key driver of periodic changes in climate was volcanic eruptions. These tend to prevent sunlight reaching Earth, causing cool, drier weather. Since 1900, greenhouse gases have been the primary cause of climate change.
The findings show that periods of low sun activity should not be expected to have a large impact on temperatures on Earth, and are expected to improve scientists' understanding and help climate forecasting.
Scientists at the University of Edinburgh carried out the study using records of past temperatures constructed with data from tree rings and other historical sources. They compared this data record with computer-based models of past climate, featuring both significant and minor changes in the sun.
They found that their model of weak changes in the sun gave the best correlation with temperature records, indicating that solar activity has had a minimal impact on temperature in the past millennium.
The study, published in Nature GeoScience, was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council.
Dr Andrew Schurer, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, said: "Until now, the influence of the sun on past climate has been poorly understood. We hope that our new discoveries will help improve our understanding of how temperatures have changed over the past few centuries, and improve predictions for how they might develop in future. Links between the sun and anomalously cold winters in the UK are still being explored."

VIENNA (Reuters) - France has asked its firms to prepare a return to Iran ahead of a likely deal with powers to curb Tehran's nuclear program, but Paris' tough stance in talks and ties with Sunni Arab states means its “love-hate” relationship with Iran will continue.

Despite a long history of commercial, political and social links with Iran that even saw Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei exiled near Paris in 1979, France has arguably been the most demanding among the six powers negotiating a final accord.
The talks will continue past Tuesday's deadline for a comprehensive agreement intended to open the door to ending sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy in exchange for limits on its most sensitive nuclear activities for at least a decade.
France's position risks alienating its companies once international sanctions are lifted and Iran is able to collect debts from overseas banks that may exceed $150 billion and attract companies to invest across all sectors, from its aging hydrocarbon-based energy system to transport and general construction.
“Everyone is looking at Iran with greed,” said a senior French official. “It's an important market, but it's not the only one. There was a strategic decision to be made on who could face Iran as it pushes its pawns in the region. That's Saudi Arabia and Egypt. That's the choice we've made.”
Paris repeatedly points to its longstanding hard line on weapons proliferation - it first began talking to Iran in 2003 over its nuclear program - as proof it is acting from a point of principle when it comes to negotiations with Iran.
But it is also true there has been a hawkish shift toward Tehran under Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, who have respectively aligned themselves with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Shi'ite Iran's main regional rival.

Similar positions on conflicts across the Middle East and Iran's role in them as well as what some Arab countries perceive as disengagement on the part of traditional ally the United States, have helped France nurture new commercial links where once Britain and the United States were dominant.
Iran has been expanding its influence across the Middle East, from Iraq to Lebanon, and Syria to Yemen, which is the latest theater in Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia's tussle for power in the region.
“The Saudis are the heavyweights in the zone and their influence goes beyond their borders. We're playing that to the full,” said a French diplomat.
The results are there to be seen. Paris has sold fighter jets, warships, helicopters and satellites to Qatar, Egypt, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates over the last year, lifting military sales over $15 billion.
Since being invited by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, to attend a regional leaders' summit in May - a rare privilege for a head of state - Hollande has signed contracts worth $12 billion including the sale of Airbus planes.
Ironically, as Western powers warn of regional nuclear proliferation if the agreement with Iran is weak, France last week became the first country to sign feasibility studies to build two nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia potentially worth more than $10 billion.
Saudi Foreign Minister, ‎Adel al-Jubeir, recently told Reuters France was an old ally and trading partner that had proved its reliability to the Gulf.
“We have common views with regard to the challenges in the region today with Syria, Yemen, Iraq, terrorism ‎and of course Iran's nuclear program, and there are very large commercial and military ties between our two countries. We hope to increase those.”
NO WORRIES FOR IRAN DEALS
Historically, French firms ranging from automaker Peugeot to oil major Total were key players in the Iranian market, but European Union and U.S. sanctions adopted in 2011 scared French firms away.
Imports from Iran to France fell to just 62 million euros in 2013 from 1.77 billion in 2011. French exports to Iran in 2013 fell to 494 million euros from 1.66 billion euros in 2011, according to French foreign ministry estimates.
A recent charm offensive has seen Iranian ministers, including the deputy oil minister, pass through Paris to whet the appetite of business-hungry executives. France-based Iranian business people have also been hired by Iranian authorities to revive links with their local counterparts.
France's main business lobby group plans to send a delegation comprising about 100 firms to Tehran in September.
“I tell French companies that even if there is a deal it will take time and that the lifting of sanctions will only slowly begin in 2015,” said a senior French diplomat involved in the talks who recently briefed firms on the prospects of a deal.
They told them that firms from other countries including the United States and Germany had already positioned themselves and there was “no time to waste”.
The diplomat confirmed that should there be an agreement Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who some diplomats say has a personal animosity to Iran since they were prime minister in the mid-1980s, would travel to Tehran quickly after.
“Love and hate dominate all aspects of our relations,” Iranian Transport Minister Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi told a recent conference in Paris, bemoaning France's lack of “Iran strategy” while outlining $80 billion of potential transport projects.
“Sooner or later the nuclear conflict will be resolved and France needs to decide on its position now. I am certain that the business people will have more realism than the politicians.”
Despite the overtures, French officials make it clear that in the immediate future Iran will play second fiddle to Sunni Arab states commercially and politically.
At home, that stance has brought some criticism, with some lawmakers saying Paris is thinking short-term, picking Sunnis over Shi'ites and leaving itself out in the cold in Iran.
“It's not because you're the first one in that you're the first served,” a second senior French government official said, dismissing their concerns. “We'll be ready. Don't worry about our firms.”
Let me just say for the record, I really don't think it is the subject matter of this thread which is causing some of the negative responses. The community, and especially masternode operators, deserve to know what kinds of regulatory risks might exist and this is a perfectly acceptable topic to discuss. The problem is when the discussion is pointed with generalized statements or assumptions that seem very much like they are intended to evoke fear in the audience -- that's the reason for the troll marks.
Note how the OP phrases things:
-------
Masternodes are coinjoin servers. Masternodes are doing mixing. what will masternode owners do when they start being charged with illegal money laundering? Asked and answered with the thread title "Masternode owners going to jail?"
-------
The reality is more complicated than that. It has not been established whether an applicable law might consider the masternodes to be "doing" the mixing, or if the privatesend users are. Masternodes are similar to centralized coinjoin servers but that does not mean they would be treated the same as coinjoin servers under a law. In addition, the law is different from one country to the next -- this article discusses regulations in the Netherlands only. The extent of the regulations is unclear and there are still pending Dutch court cases.
This is something we need to be conscious about because any precedent that is set from the Netherlands could potentially manifest itself down the road in other jurisdictions. Which, to my understanding, is a big part of why the core team has already contracted with a law firm, so that masternode operators can be informed about what the law could mean for them and to guide both their personal decisions and also their masternode votes.
IF this turns out to become a real problem, then masternodes and the dev team will need to make some decisions about the best way to respond to the situation and move forward. Remember that the regulatory climate is out of our control. It is prudent to talk proactively about planning for different possibilities, whether that involves strengthening protocol-level privacy for masternodes, non-protocol-level privacy for masternodes, or changing something about the way we do mixing. But it is not a foregone conclusion where the governments are going to come down on this, and it's also not a foregone conclusion that MNOs would not be able to respond with anything other than selling or going to jail.
My 2 duffs --
Click to expand...
Zakhe, 28, lives in Soweto in Johannesburg.  They are a lesbian and a victim of a horrifying growing trend in South Africa: corrective rape. “They tell me that they will kill me, they will rape me and after raping me, I will become a girl,” they tell ActionAid. “I will become a straight girl.”
On a Sunday morning in July 2007, the bodies of Zakhe's friends Sizakele Sigasa and Salome Masooa were found in a field in Meadowlands, a suburb of Johannesburg. Both women had been bound with their underwear, gang-raped, tortured and shot. Just weeks previously, Sizakele had said they felt uneasy in their community as one of the first women to live openly as a lesbian. Nearly eight years on, three men have been detained and released. The case is now effectively closed.
A month on from the xenophobic attacks that rocked the country last month, South Africa continues to deal with a crisis that refuses to go away; hate crimes against lesbian women to “cure” them of their homosexuality. Since the term corrective rape was coined by charity workers over a decade ago, few national statistics on levels of violence against lesbians have been compiled. At least 32 women have been raped and murdered in the last 15 years–but underreporting means this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. According to South African charity Luleki Sizwe, more than 10 women are raped or gang-raped weekly.
Societal attitudes need to shift
The country's transition to democracy and its constitutional and human rights framework has been a source of hope for South Africans. But as promise is translated into reality, South Africa is facing a number of challenges–one of which is the prevalence of gender-based violence.
South Africa has one of the highest rates of rape in the world. Of the estimated 500,000 rapes that take place every year, only one in nine are reported. For every 25 men brought to trial for rape, 24 will walk free – a poignant reminder of the aggressive masculinity that colours the social and political landscape of South Africa. In a country strongly influenced by traditional cultures and religious groups, corrective rape is a reaction to protect the status quo – women are forced to conform to gender stereotypes or suffer the consequences.
“There is a clear sense of entitlement to women's bodies which underlies the general rape pandemic, and no doubt the attack of lesbian women or women who read as gender non-conforming,” says Emily Craven, policy and programme manager at ActionAid South Africa, one of the first charities to document the use of corrective rape.
“The notion that women do not need men for either economic support or sexual pleasure is one that is deeply threatening to entrenched patriarchal values.”
Several studies have highlighted the problem of gender inequality that pervades South Africa. According to research by the anti-violence NGO, CIET, 20 per cent of men said the victim “asked for it”. In a related survey, a quarter of Soweto schoolboys described “jackrolling”–a local term for gang rape–as “fun”. Survivors of corrective rape have said their attackers wanted to show them “how to be real women and what a real man tasted like”.
With the apartheid in recent memory, its scars are evident in the gendered and racial segregation of the country. Violence is rife and there is a clear hierarchy which places women and lesbians–often in depressed socio-economic circumstances–at the bottom.
Sex education is non-existent
Part of the problem is that the cycle of hostility towards women and homosexuality is not addressed. South African schoolchildren are not taught about sexuality, sexual or reproductive health – a vital factor in changing attitudes towards sexual violence. In 2013, a UNESCO report found that schools nationwide were failing to make the grade on a number of essential topics, including gender rights.
Significantly, still, brutal violence against gay women stands in stark contradiction to the country's progressive 1996 constitution. As the first in the world to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation–South Africa was the first country in Africa to recognise same-sex marriage–the post-apartheid constitution hailed a new era of tolerance and equality.
Yet even a new constitution has failed to abolish deep-rooted bias against the South African LGBTQ community. If anything, the formal protections intensified homophobic inclinations, as the legal framework sprinted ahead of social consciousness on the issue of gay rights.
“Homophobic violence is not unique to South Africa nor is it an African phenomenon–but it is clear that this violence has taken a particular form in South Africa,” Craven says. “In the post-apartheid era a series of key legal battles were won which entrenched gay rights, culminating in the legalisation of gay marriage in 2007. These battles were however largely fought in courtrooms and little was done to try and bring the population along with the process.”
As LGBTQ issues began to feature prominently in local media, lesbian and gay men and women felt safe to come out. Yet the vast majority of the population remained openly homophobic, which led to a backlash. Recent studies show that homophobia is still a major problem–a 2013 study by the Pew Research Center found up to 61 per cent of South Africans believe society should not accept homosexuality.
The majority of attacks on lesbian women go unreported, but many are exceptionally violent–proof that attitudes towards lesbians are yet to change. Last August, 18-year-old Gift Makau was gang-raped, strangled with wire and left with a hosepipe in their mouth. Another woman, Noxolo Nogwaza was raped and stabbed to death with a shard of glass in 2011.
A failing criminal justice system
South Africa's criminal justice system has failed to keep up with the country's liberal constitution. Hate crimes on the basis of sexual orientation are still not recognised by South African law, and the courts refuse to recognise that it plays any part in cases of corrective rape. The police are reluctant to investigate hate crimes against lesbian women and there is little support for survivors.
Nomawabo, from the northernmost province of Limpopo, has been sexually assaulted twice. At the age of 15, they were raped by a schoolfriend and two years later, they were abducted by a group of men and sexually assaulted for three days. Despite these horrific attacks, they are one of the luckier victims: they survived. Yet despite reporting the crime to police, the case disappeared and their attackers were never caught.
“At school I was betrayed by my best friend. They told me to come to their house for a school assignment but when I got to the house we fought until they hit me so hard I collapsed, and then they raped me because they said I needed to stop being a lesbian,” Nomawabo told ActionAid.
“Afterwards I got pregnant and had a baby. The second time, my soccer friends and I were kidnapped at gunpoint and they took us somewhere far away and did what they wanted with us for three days. We told the police but the case just disappeared. Nothing happened because they all thought I deserved it.”
Up to 40 per cent of South African women will be raped in their lifetime according to the South African Institute of Race Relations, but estimates very widely due to underreporting. Further statistics from the South African Police Service state that between 2013 and 2014 there were a total of 46,253 rapes were reported to police countrywide. However, due to underreporting, the figure is likely to be much higher per year. The Medical Research Council estimate that only one in nine rapes are reported to the police.
Moreover, only 14 per cent of perpetrators is convicted. Such a lack of accountability has left report rates at an all-time low, partly attributed to the public perception of the police post-apartheid as a symbol of oppression. Until 1994, South Africans lived in fear of the state–unjust laws were applied unfairly, intended to entrench white domination.
The successful prosecution of rapes is a challenge most countries face–including the UK. Recent research by Them Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary also showed less than a quarter of rapes reported to the police in England and Wales resulted in a charge.
However, reporting rates are starting improve in the UK, just as South Africa heads in the opposite direction.
Despite the modern constitution, South African legislation continues to discriminate against women. Under the “cautionary rule”, a judge must show awareness to special dangers on relying on uncorroborated evidence of a complainant–thus, victims of sexual violence feel they may be deemed untrustworthy. Most victims have little faith in the police and the courts to bring their attacker to justice.
“Survivors do not have faith in the criminal justice system, perhaps rightly so,” Sarah McLaughlin of Rape Crisis South Africa says. “This means that rapists are not held accountable; there is no deterrent to rape. In addition, our government does not prioritise the issue of gender violence and does not allocate sufficient resources to address this issue.”
After over 20 years of democracy, lesbians are still living in the shadow of the apartheid. Corrective rape is a symptom of the toxic gender inequality and homophobic attitudes that continue to plague the country–a seemingly endless cycle of violence that did not end with decades of segregation.
“Many of the factors that drive the violence against women are a result of South Africa's history–such as access to safety, livelihoods and justice,” McLaughlin explains. “Violence against women comes part of the parcel of mass social and structural inequality left over from apartheid.”

Jared Carrabis of Barstool Sports reports that Clay Buchholz will undergo surgery Tuesday to repair the partial tear of their flexor pronator mass.
Buchholz was diagnosed with the partial tear of the right flexor pronator mass in their right arm last week. They were set to see Dr. James Andrews for a second opinion on Monday. It was, apparently, a bad opinion. He's expected to miss around 3-5 months, which practically speaking, could be the entire season if it's anything but the speediest recovery.
Buchholz struggled in both starts with the Phillies to start the year, giving up 10 runs on 16 hits and three walks with five strikeouts in 7.1 innings. The Phillies acquired them from the Red Sox in December, hoping they would provide starting rotation depth. So much for that.

A few months back TheX-Files writer Frank Spotnitz discussed their strong desire to do a new film in the series saying,”There is a very active and relentless fan campaign for a last movie. I do feel like it would be a terrible shame if that didn't happen. It feels wrong not to give it an ending around the alien colonisation of earth. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson feel the same.”
Now Duchovny's speaking for themselves and they back this up 100%. They told Collider, “That book doesn't close until somebody dies, really. One of the greatnesses of the show was its open-endedness. It was about possibility. It wasn't about closure. It just couldn't be. There is no such thing as that story ever ending. Those characters are forever searching. That's what they do. Even if we're not watching them, they're out there, in some dimension. Mulder and Scully are still doing their thing ‘cause that's their nature…I would love to do another film, or more. I think we're all game for it. I know I'm kind of perplexed that Fox isn't more [enthusiastic].”
I can kind of see where Fox is coming from. 2008's I Want To Believe only grossed $20M compared to Fight The Future‘s $83M (not adjusted for inflation). But Duchovny has a reasonable answer for I Want To Believe‘s financial failure. Head inside for more.
Duchovny continued, “I think Chris [Carter] is probably working on an idea, so we'll see. Unfortunately, with the last one, they didn't spend the money to compete in a summer fashion, and they brought it out in the summer. It should be a summer film. It should be an action film. But, the last one we made was not. The last one we made was a dark, contemplative, small $25 million film. It was basically an independent film. When you come out against Batman, it's not going to happen. You're not going to be sold as an independent film, and you're not going to compete against Batman with $25 million.”
For the second time this season, one of Alabama's most important defensive players suffered a season-ending injury.
This time it was the linebacker Shaun Dion Hamilton, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in their right knee late in the second quarter of the Crimson Tide's 54-16 demolition of Florida in the SEC championship game.
It was a significant blow for a defense that already absorbed the loss of safety Eddie Jackson, who fractured their leg in an Oct. 22 win over Texas A&M.
"He'll be missed," Alabama coach Nick Saban said of Hamilton, who finished the year with 64 tackles -- the third-highest total on the team.
Alabama linebacker Shaun Dion Hamilton suffered torn ACL vs. Florida Hamilton suffered the injury during the second quarter of the SEC title game
They were a key cog, after all. Entering the game last weekend, Hamilton played 494 defensive snaps -- 95 fewer than the team's top linebacker, Reuben Foster. The junior from Montgomery had earned a reputation for doing their job and playing within the parameters of the scheme.
Just eight days ago, Saban said, "He's one of those guys you can certainly depend on to make the right choice, the right decision, be in the right place relative to what their responsibility is. It's not surprising to me that he's had the production that he's had."
Among all of Alabama's defenders, Hamilton received the fourth-highest grade in pass coverage from Pro Football Focus. Only Minkah Fitzpatrick, Jackson and Foster outperformed them in this discipline. The role Hamilton plays is an important one because in the first 12 games Alabama lined up in nickel on more than half of its defensive snaps. Both they and Foster were the only two inside linebackers on the field in that package.
With Hamilton gone, Alabama turns to Rashaan Evans.
Evans, a former five-star recruit, replaced Hamilton on Saturday. They authored a performance that teetered between good and bad. On the fourth play after Hamilton went down, they failed to track Florida tight end DeAndre Goolsby on a 25-yard touchdown reception. Evans was seen backpedaling awkwardly and later confronted safety Ronnie Harrison, as they did a quick post-mortem on what happened.
Evans, though, would get a measure of redemption. In the third quarter, they chased down receiver Josh Hammond on an end-around and limited them to a one-yard gain. Later on the same drive, they made a huge contribution during Alabama's goal-line stand. On third down from Alabama's one-yard line, Evans smashed into Jordan Scarlett, knocking them back for a one-yard loss.
"I knew what I had to do," Evans said. "I knew I had to pick up the slack. When I came in, I knew I had to do my job, and that's what I did."
Before Saturday, Evans had been on the field for 174 snaps -- playing as much in coverage as they did in run defense. Evans, who has made 35 tackles and forced a fumble that led to one of Alabama's 10 defensive scores this season, showed no deficiencies in either assignment, according to Pro Football Focus. But then again, Evans didn't excel at the level that Hamilton did.
"We've looked at Rashaan Evans as a starter on our team all year long," Saban said. "He's played a significant amount. He's always the first guy in if anything happens to Reuben or Shaun Dion...We have a lot of confidence in Rashaan."
Evans hopes that during the College Football Playoff they can prove to everyone else why the coaches have invested that much faith in them as they tackle the biggest challenge of their career.
Romania may appoint a Muslim woman Prime Minister
Sevil Shhaideh, 52, may become Romania's first Muslim Prime Minister as well as the first woman to hold this position in the country's history. They come from a family with Tatar-Turkish origins and their husband is Syrian.
The Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Liberal Democratic Alliance (ALDE) told President Klaus Iohannis that they support Shhaideh for Prime Minister. They made the proposal on Wednesday morning, during consultations held at the Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest.
The proposal came as a surprise, as PSD president Liviu Dragnea told nobody, not even theirs party's other leaders, the name of the person they wanted to nominate for the job.
Sevil Shhaideh replaced Liviu Dragnea as regional development minister in May 2015, when they decided to resign after a Romanian court had sentenced them to one year probation in the case related to the 2012 referendum against former President Traian Basescu. They held this position until November 2015, when the Victor Ponta cabinet resigned amid street protests, after the Colectiv club tragedy.
In April 2016, another court ruled a final two-year suspended sentence against Dragnea, which made it more difficult for them to nominate themselves for the Prime Minister position. PSD leader Liviu Dragnea said after the consultations with President Iohannis that they couldn't nominate themselves for Prime Minister “just yet,” although they were “entitled to it” because they were the president of the political party that won the parliamentary elections.
Several PSD leaders said in recent weeks that Liviu Dragnea would be the best PM, but President Klaus Iohannis made it clear that they wouldn't nominate a Prime Minister with integrity problems. Moreover, an existing law prevents a convicted person from being a member of the Government.
To avoid a political conflict with the President, Dragnea decided to nominate one of their most trusted collaborators to lead the new cabinet.
"She is a person I fully trust and who will give me the possibility to take responsibility for the Government actions that must follow the governing program in detail," Dragnea said at the press conference after the meeting with President Iohannis. They added that they made sure the new PM would be a determined person, who has the capacity to work and understand what they are doing, instead of someone who would use this office to build a personal project and would do things only to have the media write about them. They also mentioned that Shhaideh would be PSD's only proposal for Prime Minister.
Before becoming development minister, Sevil Shhaideh was Dragnea's most trusted collaborator in the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, where they were a state secretary, since 2012.
They previously worked at Constanta County Council, where they were an IT director from 1991 until 2007, and the general manager of the General Directorate for Projects, from 2007 to 2012. Famous PSD "barron" Nicusor Constantinescu was the head of the Constanta County Council at that time.
Between 2007 and 2012, Shhaideh was also the coordinator of the National Union of County Councils of Romania. This is when they started working with Liviu Dragnea. They joined PSD in July 2015, after becoming minister.
Sevil Shhaideh is an economist. They graduated the Economic Studies University (ASE) in Bucharest and holds a master's degree in business projects from the Ovidius University in Constanta.
Some Romanian media outlets have written in the past year that Liviu Dragnea and Nicusor Constantinescu were Shhaideh's godfathers at their wedding. However, Dragnea explained that there is no such things as godfather in Muslim religion and that they were just one of the witnesses at the ceremony.
Romania is a Christian country where 86% of the population is Orthodox and 4.5% is Roman Catholic. Muslims make only a small minority (0.3%) and most of them are Tatar-Turkish ethnics living in Dobrogea, in Southeastern Romania.
President Klaus Iohannis has called all political parties represented in the new Parliament to consultations, on Wednesday and Thursday, and will likely announce their Prime Minister nomination tomorrow.

Syracuse, N.Y. -- For the third day in a row, test results show low levels of blue-green algae toxins getting into the first stages of Syracuse's water system, but none of the toxins are reaching anyone's tap water, county and city officials said today.
A statement from the city and the Onondaga County Health Department said low levels of the toxins continue to be found in village of Skaneateles water drawn from the lake, but that the addition of extra chlorine is keeping toxins out of drinking water.
"All other locations in the water system - including the city of Syracuse, the town of DeWitt, the town of Skaneateles, the village of Elbridge, and the village of Jordan - showed non-detectable levels of algal toxins in finished water," the statement said. "Residents in the village of Skaneateles and the other municipalities which use this drinking water source can continue to drink the water."
The 1,400 residents along the lake who have their own intake pipes should not drink the lake water, health officials said.
Daily testing of the city's system will continue until no more toxins are discovered. That could be a month or more, a state Department of Health official said Wednesday, particularly if the continuing hot, dry weather creates more algal blooms.
The bloom, the first on record for Skaneateles Lake, was confirmed on Friday.

Do you believe that American immigration policy should be decided by American citizens?
You do? You're behind the times! In recent years, foreign governments have taken a strong interest in our immigration policies and are actively meddling in them. That's particularly true now with the current debate over “Comprehensive Immigration Reform” a.k.a. amnesty.
Mexico is the main culprit, of course. See my recent article Mexican Foreign Ministry Meddling In Amnesty Debate—Where Is U.S. Government (And GOP)?
But Mexico is not the only case of Latino legerdemain—light-fingered Latin American countries attempting to steal America from under our noses.
For example, three Central American countries—Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras—have teamed up to push for amnesty for their illegal aliens on U.S. soil.
Here at VDARE.COM we've been writing about foreign meddling for years. The Mainstream Media might catch up to us if it didn't have another agenda. But we're thankful for anything—this month The Hill ran a story headlined Foreign governments lobbying hard in favor of immigration reform (by Julian Pecquet, February 7 , 2013]:
Foreign governments are working hard to shape the debate on immigration reform as momentum for a comprehensive bill builds in Congress. While the issue routinely comes up in talks between foreign leaders and the executive branch, embassy officials are ramping up their outreach to Congress and the White House in order to take advantage of the best hope for reform in years. A number of countries with significant immigration ties to the United States—notably Mexico, Ireland and several Central American nations—have been making their concerns known while doing their best to avoid meddling in domestic affairs.
The Hill article reported that Mexico's new ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora (see my article linked above) is already in the thick of it, having had “a number of meetings with the administration” on immigration; and that the Mexican ambassador “is expected to meet with lawmakers shortly as legislation begins to take form.”
Of course, these foreign meddlers have allies in the U.S. Congress:
Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), a leader on immigration reform [with an F- grade from Numbers USA , see VDARE.COM file here], said he'd had “conversations over time with a number” of ambassadors about immigration reform. They said they didn't see any reason not to listen to anyone with “good ideas.” According to Becerra, “…it's no hidden secret that it's important for a lot of these ambassadors and their governments to see comprehensive immigration reform pass.”
No kidding!
But why would an “American” member of congress be helping them?
Whose side is they on?
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are three Central American, Spanish-speaking countries, southeast of Mexico and poorer than Mexico. (Here's a map). Central American illegal aliens reach the U.S. by traversing Mexico, where they are treated very badly (see here).
The Salvadoran foreign minister, Hugo Martinez, recently announced a joint Project involving El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. According to the EFE news agency, the three countries “together will lobby American functionaries and lawmakers in search of achieving the migratory reform in that country. [Honduras, El Salvador y Guatemala cabildearán por reforma migratoria en EUA , La Prensa.hn, February 12, 2013]
In fact, the three foreign ministers (Martinez of El Salvador, Fernando Carrera of Guatemala, Arturo Corrales of Honduras) are planning to visit Washington during the last week of February to lobby for amnesty.
Martinez explained that “We have made an alliance with Guatemala, with Chancellor Carrera, and with Chancellor Corrales of Honduras” since their three countries would be “the most impacted by an eventual migratory reform in the United States.
Martinez went on:
…We are going to make a joint negotiation in Washington with representatives of the House of Representatives, with senators and with members of the executive of the United States to sensitize and raise awareness of the urgency of a comprehensive migratory reform.
According to their own governments, there are five million immigrants (legal and illegal) from the three countries in the U.S.: 1.5 million Guatemalans, 2.5 million Salvadorans, a little more than a million Hondurans.
As a consequence, there is a lot of interest in these countries about their fellow citizens way up in the United States. For example, in El Salvador there is a page on the website of the La Prensa Grafica newspaper entitled “Departamento 15”.
El Salvador is divided into 14 administrative divisions called departamentos. So the Salvadoran diaspora in the United States constitutes Departamento 15!
Get it?
Recently, the page featured a story about a Salvadoran candidate (Ana Cubas) running for the Los Angeles City Council (District 9) who was endorsed by the LA Spanish language newspaper La Opinion—and, of course, about the U.S. immigration debate.
Through the immigrants, there is a lot of remittance money flowing from the U.S. to these countries—accounting for an even bigger share of their economies than of Mexico's. For Honduras, remittances constitute a whopping one-quarter of its entire economy.
So these three little countries' governments are motivated to meddle. They want their illegals in our country to be able to stay. They don't want them coming home.
We should not underestimate their motivation. Nor should we underestimate their capabilities. They have substantial diplomatic “boots on the ground” (Guccis on the ground?) on U.S. soil. I've written often about the Mexican diplomatic networks in the U.S., but these three Central American countries are nothing to ignore either.
Each has an embassy in Washington, D.C. In addition, they have quite a few consulates spread from coast to coast:
Guatemala has ten consulates, located in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Phoenix, Providence and San Francisco.
Honduras has eleven consulates, located in Washington, D.C., Miami, Atlanta, Houston, New York, Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix.
El Salvador has no less than 16 consulates! They are located in Elizabeth (New Jersey), Long Island, Boston, Chicago, Coral Gables (Florida), Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Nogales [on the border with Mexico], New York, San Francisco, Santa Ana (California), Washington (D.C.), Woodbridge (Virginia), Woodstock (Georgia).
The total population of El Salvador is 6,090,646, but there are supposed to be 1,978,000 Salvadoran-Americans.
On the other hand, only 19, 000 Americans live in El Salvador—because El Salvador apparently has much better immigration controls than we do.
So we can expect some heavy-duty lobbying from these countries and their Fifth Column of expatriates on U.S. soil.
Why do we allow this? Why are foreign politicians and diplomats allowed to openly meddle in our immigration policy?
And, as I've asked before: who in the GOP is standing up to this?

A team of U.S. Navy SEALs boarded an oil tanker Sunday night in the Mediterranean Sea in an apparent bid to prevent the delivery of Libyan crude worth several million dollars that members of a militia had been attempting to sell, according to U.S. and Libyan officials.
In an operation approved by President Obama, the SEALs commandeered the commercial tanker Morning Glory shortly after 10 p.m. Eastern time and were en route overnight to a Libyan port, Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement. No one was hurt during the operation, they said.
Libya's fledgling government had strongly opposed the sale of oil by a militia in eastern Libya and at one point threatened to bomb the tanker, which it said at the time was a North Korean-flagged vessel. When it set sail last week, outraged lawmakers ousted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan through a no-confidence vote and installed the country's defense minister as interim leader. Zeidan had become deeply unpopular for failing to rein in the militias that emerged during Libya's 2011 civil war.
In a statement Monday, the Libyan government said its initial efforts to seize control of the ship had failed because of “bad weather and inadequate resources.”
The dispute over the ship underscored the weakness of the Libyan government and the extent to which the Obama administration is willing to use military force to support an oil-rich nation still reeling from the aftermath of its civil war.

“The Libyan Interim Government confirms that the sale of Libyan oil is the main source of national income and any illegal removal will not be tolerated,” the Libyan government said. The statement credited the United States and Cyprus with helping stop the shipment.
The ship's crew, the Pentagon statement said, was “safe and well” and would be “dealt with according to international and national law.”
The Pentagon said the SEALs used the USS Roosevelt as a staging platform for the mission and described the tanker as a “stateless ship” when the SEALs boarded it.
The U.S. statement said that prior to the SEALs' boarding, the master of the ship had reported that the vessel had been “boarded by force” and that the “crew was in danger.”
“We don't want to live in a world where armed individuals or groups are able to seize vessels, threaten people's lives and sell stolen cargo for their own financial gain,” the statement said. “This was a stateless vessel on the high seas that was not flying under a flag recognized by any nation.”
Pentagon officials said the ship is expected to arrive in Libya within four days. The ship was sailing under the authority of 25 U.S. sailors assigned to the destroyer USS Stout. Three Libyan men aboard the ship were in U.S. custody, but it remained unclear where or whether they would be prosecuted. As they secured the ship, the SEALs found two AK-47 assault rifles, the Pentagon statement said.
In the eastern city of Benghazi, a prominent business person said the overnight raid sparked outrage among Libyans who have sought greater autonomy from the state and whose sense of disenfranchisement dates to the era of rule by Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi.
“The people are saying that the United States betrayed us, and we thought it was our partner,” said Fathallah Bin Ali, an associate of Ibrahim al-
Jathran, leader of a federalist militia that was attempting to sell the oil.
Jathran and their allies accuse the post-revolutionary government of neglecting the east, where the bulk of the country's oil and gas wealth is located. Their militia seized key eastern oil terminals last summer in an effort to force Tripoli to give eastern Libyans greater control over oil sales, which are handled by a state-run company and ministry based in Tripoli.
The U.S. operation could alienate an eastern Libyan faction that has remained relatively friendly to the United States in an atmosphere of growing Islamist extremism. Bin Ali, a Benghazi resident who was a friend of J. Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador who was killed in the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post there, said the seizure of the tanker left some Libyans feeling angry.
The operation showed that the United States is first and foremost “a capitalist country” that had abandoned its friends, they said. “They believe that crude is more sacred than blood,” they added.
A series of explosions struck Benghazi on Monday, further underscoring the lawlessness in Libya's eastern region. The first blast, caused by a powerful car bomb, killed at least eight people outside a graduation ceremony for new soldiers, the Reuters news agency reported. At least two other explosions elsewhere in the city wounded more than a dozen people, residents said.
The United States is among the nations that impose sanctions on North Korea, a nuclear-armed state that routinely threatens to attack neighboring South Korea and Western nations. Reports that the ship was a North Korean-flagged vessel led to speculation that the oil was destined for Pyongyang, although North Korea denied that it was behind the purchase.
The United States protested Sunday after reports that Pyongyang had test-fired 25 short-range missiles. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki called on North Korea to “refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions.”

New York Mets starter Noah Syndergaard has come a long way since being validated by their first major league standing ovation 10 months ago.
About 10 days before the season started, I asked the Twitterverse what the ceiling was for Syndergaard this season. The result was a mix, mostly high end (“Kershaw” was the response of a few) but with a little more conservatism (3.15 ERA, 1.20 WHIP), too.
I posed the same question after Syndergaard's second start and the high-end assessments were even higher (“ceiling Clemens, floor Smoltz”). The conservatism was gone, replaced by superhero worship (with humorous intent, of course).
This was my favorite response:
@msimonespn literally Thor. I fully expect them to bring lightning, thunder and rain down upon their foes at some point this season. — Tejesh (@MetsProspectHub) April 16, 2016
I asked the same question about Syndergaard's ceiling of a few people who evaluate baseball talent for a living.
“As high [as] or higher than anyone in the game,” said ESPN baseball analyst Curt Schilling, a former MLB fireballer.
“[His] ceiling is unlimited. Amazing talent. I wish them good health," said a longtime major league scout.
"My 2016 NL Cy Young favorite," said ESPN baseball analyst Dallas Braden, another former big league pitcher.
What has everyone so excited is not just the 99-mph power Syndergaard regularly displays -- they have thrown 36 pitches of 98.5 mph or faster in their first two starts -- but also an amazing, relatively new pitch, which some call the "Warthen Slider" (read the explainers from Eno Sarris and Jeff Sullivan) and others in the scouting world think is a cutter.
Noah Syndergaard has excelled in keeping their best pitch in spots where it's tough to make good contact. ESPN Stats & Information
Opposing hitters can't touch Noah Syndergaard's slider. ESPN Stats & Information
Syndergaard has thrown the pitch 45 times this season, resulting in 16 outs and only one baserunner (a soft line drive single by Royals outfielder Lorenzo Cain on April 5). The offering functions as an amazing put-away pitch -- they have thrown it 23 times in two-strike counts and recorded 11 strikeouts.
The average pitcher gets a strikeout on about one-fourth of their two-strike sliders and one-sixth of their two-strike cutters. Syndergaard's rate through two starts is 48 percent.
The great thing about the pitch for Syndergaard is how low risk it is. They have thrown only one of those pitches in that “middle-middle” happy zone in which hitters often crush baseballs and three of them in that “middle-third” location width-wise where it is easy for a hitter to make good contact. You can see that, particularly versus right-handed hitters, Syndergaard's location is pinpoint.
Though everyone was wowed when Syndergaard hit 95 mph with the pitch against the Royals, their velocity with it settled in at an average of 92, both with the 23 they threw against the Royals and the 22 they threw against the Marlins their last time out on April 12.
Most K, First 3 Games of Season Mets History (Source: Elias Sports Bureau) 2005 Pedro Martinez 30 1971 Tom Seaver 28 1970 Nolan Ryan 28 2009 Johan Santana 27 1991 Dwight Gooden 27 ** Noah Syndergaard: 21 K in first 2 starts
For some context, the next-highest average slider velocity for a pitcher this season is about 90 mph. The highest average cutter velocity was right at Syndergaard's 92 mph (Jeff Samardzija and closers Kenley Jansen, and David Robertson throw it that hard).
“That they can throw it not only that hard, but that they can command it, I think, is most impressive,” Mets catcher Kevin Plawecki told ESPN.com's Adam Rubin on Saturday. “To be able to throw a 95-mph slider and not know where it's going is not easy, but I feel like you can throw it as hard as you can and not know where it's going. But for them to be able to throw it as hard as they do and know where to put and to spot it up, I think, is most important.”
Added fellow backstop Travis d'Arnaud: “It has the depth, too. Sometimes guys who learn the slider, it moves more horizontally instead of vertically. The depth on it makes it very good as well.”
This is a pitch that, Syndergaard's long-term health permitting, has a chance to be as well regarded as Mariano Rivera's great cutter.
"To call it an equalizer implies that there is a point in time during an at-bat that a hitter has a chance," Braden said. "This is just not the case. It's a neutralizer, a devastator. It sends batter after batter to their final resting place in Valhalla."
The mental challenge
There's an aspect of Syndergaard's potential transition from star to superhero that will bear watching throughout the season -- the mental challenges that come with being the man. They may not have to be the man on the Mets, but they could end up being just that, given Matt Harvey's slow start. That's a challenging transition.
"A player needs to stick to what they did to get to this point," Dr. Ray Karesky, who has been a team psychologist for multiple major league teams, wrote in an email on Sunday. "If they are a humble, down-to-earth guy, they need to stay that way. Likewise, if they are a cocky, aggressive [person], they need to stay that way also. They can't let outside influences take them away from their game and who they are. The best way to do this is for the player to keep doing the same routines and talking with the same people that got them to this point.
"Most of all, a player must try to stay true to the best in himself. This is not only a way to increase the likelihood of their continued success, it will also see them through tough times that are an inevitable part of baseball and life."
Said Braden: "He must remind themselves daily that what they have done to get to this point is not enough. They have shown the capacity to welcome all challenges mental and physical alike, their greatest opponent will always be himself."

Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) Adm. Michael Rogers. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais The National Security Agency infected key Russian networks with remotely-controlled "implants" that would cause "pain and discomfort" if they are ever used, according to a new report in The Washington Post.
The Post report, which focuses on Moscow's interference in the 2016 presidential election and the Obama administration's response, said the program was a covert action that would allow the US to retaliate if Russia carries out similar behavior in the future.
"Implants are a term used by the intelligence community for malicious code and backdoors," David Kennedy, a former Marine intelligence specialist and founder of TrustedSec and Binary Defense Systems, told Business Insider. "Essentially [it is] the ability to implant code that goes undetected."
Though the report says Russia would feel "pain" if the infected networks were "disrupted," it's not clear whether the implants were designed to affect infrastructure, similar to how the NSA carried out a successful operation called "Olympic Games" (more commonly referred to as the Stuxnet attack) that set back Iran's nuclear program.
Regardless, the US certainly has the capability to affect an adversary's physical world — the power grid, telephones, and internet — through cyber means. In Iran, for example, the NSA carried out another operation called "Nitro Zeus," which used cyber implants to give the US access into Iran's air defense systems so it could not shoot down planes, its command-and-control systems so communications would go dead, and infrastructure like the power grid, transportation, and financial systems.
"It seems pretty reasonable to think that there are things out there today that we haven't seen that are much more advanced [than Stuxnet]," Liam O'Murchu, a director at Symantec who helped discover the Stuxnet virus, told Business Insider last year.
The Russia operation, still in its early stages, was signed off on by President Obama in the waning days of their administration. President Trump has not changed or stopped the operation, according to officials who spoke with The Post.
Amid uncertainty around whether President Trump's Justice Department will respect state cannabis laws, Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week sent a letter to Washington state officials slamming that state's legal cannabis system. It's the attorney general's sharpest opposition to legal cannabis since they asked Congress to remove a crucial federal protection for medical marijuana states.
In the letter, sent to Gov. Jay Inslee and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office upset the Trump administration by successfully challenging the White House's travel ban, Sessions reiterates that “Congress has determined that marijuana is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of marijuana is a crime.” They cite a 2016 law enforcement report that they say “raises serious questions about the efficiency of marijuana ‘regulatory structures' in your state.”
Sessions' letter, obtained and first reported by the Huffington Post, draws exclusively on the report by the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, a drug-prohibition enforcement program out of the US Office of National Drug Control. It includes a laundry list of claims in an effort to show that Washington's cannabis laws are failing to effectively regulate the industry.
76% of Americans support individual states being able to make their own laws around cannabis use and sales.
Not only is the medical market “considered ‘grey' due to the lack of regulation and oversight,” Sessions writes, but “the ‘recreationally licensed' marijuana market is also incompletely regulated.” They note evidence for the diversion of Washington-grown cannabis into other US states and raises concerns about illegal sales of cannabis to minors.
Some of the statistics are misleading. The letter says, for example, that “In 2014 alone, 17 THC extraction labs exploded,” but it doesn't say whether those labs were above-board operations or amateur, black-market concentrate makers. Virtually all explosions related to extraction have occurred at illegal and unregulated facilities.
They also write that “Washington State marijuana has been found to have been destined for 43 different states,” though they don't specify what that means. While there have been some recorded examples of larger shipments of cannabis being diverted out of the state, Sessions' numbers could very well include a tourist's attempt to bring a vape pen home on an airplane.
As for underage use, several studies have shown that cannabis consumption by minors in legal-cannabis states has remained steady or even fallen. In Colorado, a report found that rates of use increased among adults from 2005 to 2014 but actually decreased among minors.
Sessions' letter came in response to three separate letters from Washington state officials urging them to respect the state's cannabis laws. In their reply, they write that they appreciate the “offer to engage in continuing dialogue on this important issue.” They then directs state officials to explain how they plan to solve every problem in the system.
“Please advise as to how Washington plans to address the findings in the Northwest HIDTA report,” they write, “including efforts to ensure that all marijuana activity is compliant with state marijuana laws.”
Earlier this year, a Quinnipiac poll found that 94% of Americans support allowing doctors prescribing adults medical marijuana.
Another survey, conducted by SurveyUSA for the advocacy organization Marijuana Majority, found that 76% of Americans support individual states being able to make their own laws around cannabis use and sales.

Entering last week's matchup with Arizona State's aggressive, blitz-heavy defense, the UO offense knew it might be in for a boom-or-bust night.
The Ducks ended up scoring four offensive touchdowns in regulation, three on plays of 39 yards or longer, and the fourth a miracle fourth-down heave by Vernon Adams Jr. to force overtime. Conversely, they went three-and-out five times, before scoring four straight times at the end of regulation and in the three overtime periods.
“We knew we had to hit some big plays, and we landed some,” UO offensive coordinator Scott Frost said. “… We hit on just enough of them to make it happen.”
Ultimately, the ASU game might end up being the most uniquely challenging preparation of the entire season for Oregon's offensive staff. For one thing, the Ducks expected the Sun Devils to make an effort to pick up their play signals, and so employed large white sheets on the sideline to shield them from the Arizona State coaches.
Also, ASU was allowing Pac-12 foes to rush for just 64.5 yards per game entering last week, which had UO coaches plumbing the playbook for new wrinkles to open up their rushing attack. Oregon ended up rushing for 186 yards, most allowed by ASU to an FBS opponent this season, and 163 came on just four plays, in keeping with the “boom-or-bust” game the Ducks anticipated.
“When they're blitzing gaps, getting that many guys to the line of scrimmage … we knew we had to do some different things,” Frost said.
The Ducks used direct snaps to both running back Royce Freeman and receiver Bralon Addison over the course of the game. Those plays yielded minimal results, but Oregon ended up averaging 6.6 yards per carry thanks to its big plays, after USC, UCLA, Colorado and Utah combined to average just 2.18 yards per carry in ASU's previous four conference games.
On the Ducks' second possession of the game, the offense went three-and-out. Freeman ran for one yard on first down, then lost a yard on third-and-one to force a punt. They busted loose for runs of 64 and 16 yards later in the half, but on the first possession of the third quarter, Freeman ran three times for six yards.
“We've just got to execute early in the game,” Adams said Monday. “The defense gave us a lot of chances to score more points early in the game, especially in the first half. But I'm glad with how we finished.”
Against California this Saturday in Autzen Stadium (7:30 p.m., ESPN2), the Ducks will face a rush defense that has allowed 208 yards per game and 11 touchdowns over four games away from home. Both Adams and Frost said they hope a faster tempo can be employed to help provide Oregon's offense some momentum this week.
At Arizona State, Oregon's complex signaling system – five different sets of signals, all hidden behind the white sheets – contributed to a slower tempo, as did ASU's pressure. Frost said the Ducks didn't want to be “fast and frivolous” against the Sun Devils, instead taking time pre-snap to make sure the proper protection was set against the blitz ASU was showing.
But going forward, “I'd like to see us continue to go faster,” Frost added.
Practice notes: Monday's workout was held at walk-through tempo, so there are no highlights to pass along. … In case you missed a couple news items today, Oregon's Nov. 14 game at Stanford will kick off at 4:30 p.m. for a FOX television audience. Also, both Adams and kick returner Charles Nelson were named Pac-12 players of the week. … Freeman has been named a semifinalist for the Maxwell Award. Mariota Mariota took home the trophy last year as national player of the year in college football. …
There was a lot of excitement among the staff today for former UO offensive lineman Ramsen Golpashin, who came to Oregon as a walk-on and developed all the way into a starter to open the 2011 season. Golpashin took a job this fall as a graduate assistant at Hawaii; the Rainbow Warriors on Sunday dismissed head coach Norm Chow and promoted offensive line coach Chris Naeole to the position, with Golpashin expected to play an even bigger role coaching the team's offensive line going forward.
The e-commerce giant says next Wednesday it will welcome applicants at 10 of its warehouses, including the one in Kent, where it plans to hire hundreds. Amazon says it will make “thousands” of job offers on the spot.
Amazon.com says it will hold a giant, multisite job fair next Aug. 2, 2017, to help fill some of the 50,000 jobs open across its U.S. network of fulfillment centers.
Some 1,000 of those jobs are in Washington state.
The e-commerce giant says that on the occasion it calls “Jobs Day” it will welcome applicants at 10 of its warehouses, including the one in Kent, where it plans to hire hundreds. Amazon says it will make “thousands” of job offers on the spot.
The move underscores the continued rapid growth of Amazon's fulfillment operations. The company has invested billions building new facilities to catch up with increasing customer demand for the products sold on its website, and to keep its promises of ever-quicker delivery.
At the end of the first quarter the company had 351,000 employees, a 43 percent jump from the previous year.
The hiring spree comes in the midst of a tightening U.S. job market, with the national unemployment rate at 4.4 percent in June.
Amazon says that most of the jobs available are full time and entail picking, packing and shipping customer orders. Some 10,000 of the opportunities on offer are part-time roles at sorting centers, smaller facilities that sift through packages shipped from Amazon's warehouses and send them to local post offices.
Those who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible for benefits that are the same as those of Amazon's corporate employees and include health insurance, retirement savings and paid leave.
The fulfillment centers participating in the Jobs Day, besides the one in Kent, are in Maryland, Tennessee, Ohio, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Wisconsin, New Jersey and Illinois. They will be open to applicants between 8 a.m. and noon next Wednesday, Aug. 2.
The Kent center is at 21005 64th Ave. S.
Scientists have found fossil evidence of ancient microbial communities that lived 3.5 billion years ago.
The new fossils, described in the journal Astrobiology, may be among the most ancient fossil life forms ever found.
"This is one of the, or the, the oldest fossils ever found. You've got a 3.5-billion-year-old ecosystem," said study co-author Robert Hazen, an earth scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C.
The new find reveals that a scant 1 billion years after Earth's origin, complex microbial communities that clung to sediments along the windswept seashore had already begun harvesting energy from sunlight, rather than the rocks.
Oldest fossils
Scientists hotly debate how life began on Earth. Though chemical evidence of carbon-based life forms, such as isotopes (or different forms) of carbon, reveal that life existed on early Earth, scientists have discovered a few controversial traces of its existence.
A few stromatolites, or domelike like rock structures built by ancient microbial communities, have been found at the Strelley Pool formation in Australia that may date to about 3.45 billion years ago. Fossil sulfur-eating microbes from about 3.4 billion years ago have also been found there as well. Other fossils from South Africa reveal microbial communities that date to 2.9 billion years ago. [Images: One-of-a-Kind Places on Earth]
Hazen's colleague, Nora Noffke, a researcher at Old Dominion University in Virginia, was studying ancient rocks at the Dresser Formation in Australia when they spotted some unusual formations.
The region had tens of meters of spots with a rough, wavy texture. To the untrained eye, the texture could have been anything, but Noffke had spent years studying similar formations that were created by ancient and modern microbial communities.
"So many geologists have walked over the same rocks and never noticed anything," Hazen told LiveScience.
The areas had ripple marks going in many different directions, which often form because the microbial mats protect sediments in some areas while exposing others.
Under a microscope, the formations revealed a series of individual black filaments intertwined with sand grains that are characteristic of microbial mat communities.
"This is what's called binding and trapping — this is how a mat structure becomes stabilized against waves," Hazen said.
And the rocks also contained key mineral forms that are characteristic of the structures.
Oldest photosynthesizers
The ancient microbial communities, which may have been purple or brown and very smelly, Hazen said, probably lived along hundreds of miles of seashore, anchoring to the sand via filaments and harvesting nutrients from the sediments that washed ashore. Similar mats are found today in coastal regions with stagnant water.
More primitive rock-eating bacteria, called chemolithotrophs, likely evolved before the microbial mats, though no trace of Earth's earliest pioneers has yet been found. Chemolithotrophs harvest energy by chemically modifying minerals such as iron or sulfur in the rock, and many such bacteria are still alive today.
But the newly discovered communities were anchored to the seashore close to sun and water, so they probably weren't eating minerals found in rock. Instead, they must have harvested energy through photosynthesis, suggesting such bacteria evolved earlier than previously thought.
"That means very early in Earth's history, microbes had switched from using rocks for its energy to using light," Hazen said.

Ai Weiwei, China's best-known artist, remains missing more than a day after they were detained. Police have confiscated dozens of items from their studio.
Officers released their wife and several assistants late last night, following questioning, but Ai and a friend remain uncontactable. Assistants said that police removed more than 30 computers and hard drives from their studio and home in north Beijing on Sunday, as well as notebooks and documents. They also searched at least two more properties connected to the artist.
The scope of the police operation, and the fact that Ai was detained at Beijing airport on Sunday morning – not turned away from their flight, as had happened before – has increased the concern of friends. Officials had also visited their studio three times in the week before their detention.
"There is no news of them so far," their wife, Lu Qing, told the Associated Press.
"They asked me about Ai Weiwei's work and the articles they posted online ... I told them that everything that Ai did was very public, and if they wanted to know their opinions and work they could just look at the internet."
They said police gave no indication of their husband's whereabouts or why they were being held. They added that their mother, who is in their 80s, was very anxious about their son's fate.
Beijing police told the Guardian they knew nothing of Ai or the other missing man, Wen Tao. An airport police spokesperson said they had no obligation to give out information.
Although the 53-year-old artist has repeatedly clashed with authorities owing to their outspoken criticism of the government, they were thought to enjoy greater latitude than most thanks to their father's status as a revered poet and their own high international profile. They also helped to design the Olympic Bird's Nest stadium.
Ai created last year's Sunflower Seeds installation at the Tate Modern turbine hall in London. Their exhibition at the Lisson Gallery, also in London, is due to open next month, shortly after their recreation of a Chinese zodiac sculpture is unveiled at the courtyard in Somerset House.
In an interview last year, asked about the possibility of retribution from the authorities, they told the Guardian: "I have to deal with it, but not to prepare for it, because it is a kind of stupidity. If you prepare for it too much, you become a part of it."
Their detention comes amid a widespread crackdown on activists and dissidents in China, which has seen more than 20 people criminally detained, three formally arrested for incitement to subversion and a dozen go missing.
"It is getting worse and worse. Ai Weiwei is a very influential figure ... [if] even people like them are taken away, it gives a very bad sign to other human rights defenders and netizens [socially concerned internet users]," said Patrick Poon, executive secretary of the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.
Five human rights lawyers are among those missing since February and Poon said it had now emerged that another one, Liu Zhengqing, was taken away on 24 March.
Liu had been travelling for several weeks and friends lost contact with them when they returned to their home in Guangzhou. Poon said it was unclear why Liu was held, but that it might be related to their agreement to represent one of the lawyers who had already gone missing.
Are you in Nairobi? Send us your images and experiences, but please stay safe.
Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Several gunmen remain inside a besieged mall in Nairobi, Kenya, two senior officials said, as a deadly standoff between Kenyan forces and terrorists stretches into a fourth day.
Kenya's Interior Ministry tweeted late Monday that authorities were in control of the Westgate Shopping Mall -- the latest in a series of social media posts from officials reassuring a nervous public that there was little chance of escape for any surviving Al-Shabaab gunmen who had terrorized the mall, killing at least 62 people.
"Taken control of all the floors. We're not here to feed the attackers with pastries but to finish and punish them," Kenyan police Inspector General David Kimaiyo said on Twitter.
But even as police stressed on Twitter that they were in charge of the situation, two senior Kenyan officials told CNN that gunmen -- including snipers -- were still inside the four-story mall.
It wasn't clear whether any hostages remained. The Kenya Red Cross said 65 people were missing after the attack.
Gunfire echoed from the mall sporadically during the day, sending journalists and aid workers scrambling for cover. Thick heavy smoke -- from a fire set by terrorists, according to Kenyan authorities -- billowed into the air much of the afternoon.
Kenya assault raises new fears about Somali recruitment
Three terrorists have been confirmed killed since Saturday, the Interior Ministry said Monday. Eleven Kenyan soldiers have been wounded, according to the Kenya Defence Forces. More than 200 civilians have been rescued, the military said.
Away from the mall, Kenyan authorities said they had arrested more than 10 people for questioning in connection with the attack, including at least four taken into custody at an airport.
Authorities urged law enforcement officers to closely scrutinize travelers' documents, and the country's Immigration Department said in a tweet that it had increased security at entry and exit points.
Surviving the Nairobi mall massacre: 'Just lucky'
Americans involved?
Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told "PBS NewsHour" that some of the attackers had come from the United States. They said they were originally from Minnesota and Missouri, PBS reported Monday.
"As you know, both the victims and the perpetrators came from Kenya, the United Kingdom and the United States," they said. "From the information that we have, two or three Americans, and I think so far I've heard of one Brit" as being among the attackers.
"The Americans, from the information we have, are young men, about between maybe 18 and 19, of Somalia origin or Arab origin," Mohamed told PBS. They offered no other specifics.
Them comments seemed to expound on those of Gen. Julius Karangi, chief of Defense Forces.
"We have an idea who these people are and they are clearly a multinational collection from all over the world," they told reporters in Nairobi. "This is not clearly a local event. We are fighting global terrorism here."
Before its Twitter account was suspended, Al-Shabaab issued a list of the names of nine people it said were among the attackers. It said three were from the United States, two from Somalia and one each from Canada, Finland, Kenya and the United Kingdom.
Sources within Al-Shabaab also told CNN that the nine names published on Twitter were among the alleged hostage-takers, but CNN has not been able to independently confirm that.
U.S. officials don't have any confirmation of Americans having been involved in the attack, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and another senior official.
Intelligence analysts are poring over electronic intercepts in an effort to verify the terror group's claims, two law enforcement sources told CNN.
The FBI also was looking into the claims, law enforcement officials told CNN.
"At this point we have no definitive evidence of the nationalities or identities of the perpetrators," State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said Monday.
In the past, federal officials and Somali-American leaders in Minneapolis have reported that Al-Shabaab has recruited young men there to go to Africa to fight.
U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences over the attack after a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly Monday. They didn't specify whether Americans had been involved, but they pledged U.S. support and described the situation as a matter of global concern.
"This, I think, underscores the degree to which all of us as an international community have to stand against the kind of senseless violence that these kinds of groups represent," Obama said.
The siege
The terrorist attack began at midday Saturday, Nairobi time, with an estimated 10 to 15 gunmen taking over the mall in what hospital volunteer Abiti Shah said witnesses told them was "like a Hollywood action scene."
"They just started firing in the air," Shah said, retelling the witness accounts.
A youth cooking competition was taking place at the mall at the time, and terrified shoppers fled for their lives as gunfire echoed through the building.
Witnesses said the gunmen went from store to store, shooting people, and then took hostages.
Survivor Bendita Malakia, a North Carolina woman who moved to Nairobi in July, told CNN affiliate WAVY that they took refuge behind the closed metal gates of a store with dozens of others.
The Kenyan spirit cannot be broken, says eyewitness resident
"While we were back there, you could hear them methodically going from store to store, talking to people and asking questions," they said. "They were shooting, screaming. Then it would stop for a while and they would go to another store."
Al-Shabaab has claimed that the attackers targeted non-Muslims and vowed they would not negotiate for the hostages' lives. CNN security analyst Peter Bergen said the terrorists apparently took hostages only to prolong the siege and win more media attention.
The dead
Most of the dead were said to be Kenyans.
Six British citizens, two French nationals, two Indians and two Canadians, including a diplomat, also died, their governments said.
Those killed include:
• Elif Yavuz, a senior vaccines researcher for the Clinton Health Access Initiative based in Tanzania. Yavuz, a Dutch national, was pregnant and expecting their first child in October, according to Julio Frenk, dean of faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health. "Elif was brilliant, dedicated, and deeply admired by their colleagues, who will miss them terribly," the Clinton family said in a statement. The Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed a 33-year-old Dutch woman had been killed.
• A major African poet, author and Ghanian statesman, Kofi Awoonor, Ghana's president said. Awoonor received their Ph.D. from New York's Stony Brook University and was a professor of literature there in the 1970s.
• The nephew of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the man's fiancee.
• A Peruvian doctor, Juan Jesus Ortiz, who had previously worked for the United Nations Fund for Children and lived in Kenya doing consulting work, the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
• Sridhar Natarajan, 40, an Indian national and employee of a local pharmaceutical firm, and 8-year-old Paramshu Jain, the son of a bank branch manager, CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported, citing government officials in New Delhi.
The wounded
Kenyatta said more than 175 people had been wounded. Five were Americans, the State Department said Sunday.
Elaine Dang, 26, a University of California, Berkeley, graduate from San Diego, underwent surgery to their chest, arms and legs.
"I'm OK, I'm very grateful to be alive," they told CNN affiliate KFMB-TV
They said two friends died in the attack.
Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack
The terrorists
The Somalia-based Al-Shabaab terror group had said on Twitter that it had sent the gunmen to the mall in retaliation for Kenya's involvement in an African Union military effort against the group, which is al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia.
Last year, the Kenyan military was part of a peacekeeping force that defeated Al-Shabaab forces to liberate the key Somali port of Kismayo.
Since Kenya launched attacks against Al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2011, the group has hurled grenades at Kenyan churches, bus stops and other public places.
The mall attack is the deadliest terror attack in Kenya since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy there in 1998, killing 213 people.
On Monday, Kenya's foreign minister told CNN it's clear that Al-Shabaab was not acting alone.
"This bares the hallmarks of al Qaeda. This is not just Al-Shabaab. In fact, the leaders are not Somali, as you may have heard. This was al Qaeda. It was a very well-coordinated effort, it was very well planned," Mohamed said.
But the attackers' national origins are irrelevant, they said.
"It doesn't matter where they come from. There are some Americans. There are some Brits. There are some others. It has nothing to do with the nationality of people," Mohamed said. "They are all evil and we must deal with them as such."
Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness
The investigation
Lenku said that Monday's effort to roust the terrorists was a Kenyan operation, but government sources told CNN that Israeli special forces also were at the scene.
Kenyatta, the Kenyan president, vowed Sunday to punish those responsible for the attacks.
"They shall not get away with their despicable, beastly acts. Like the cowardly perpetrators now cornered in the building, we will punish the masterminds swiftly and indeed very painfully," they said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry promised an American investigation.
Kenya bloodshed: World leaders react
"Obviously, it's an enormous offense against everybody's sense of right and wrong," Kerry said. "It represents the seriousness and the breadth of the challenge we face with ruthless and completely reckless terrorists, and we're going to pursue them."
Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Zain Verjee and Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi. CNN's Arwa Damon, Becky Anderson, Lillian Lesposo, Holly Yan, Greg Botelho, Brian Walker, Jackie Castillo, David Simpson, Dominique Dodley and Kevin Conlon also contributed to this report.

STATEMENT ON HILLARY CLINTONS SPEECH TO THE AMERICAN LEGION NATIONAL CONVENTION
Trump-Pence ^ | August 31 2016 | Trump Campaign
Posted on by euram
Hillary Clinton has shown they are fundamentally unequipped to further the national security interests of the United States and stand up for our veterans. As Secretary of State, they put our countrys diplomacy up for sale to Clinton Foundation donors and exposed classified information on more than 2,000 occasions on their secret email server. And whether it was their votes against veterans medical care in the U.S. Senate or their claims that the ongoing VA wait time crisis wasn't 'widespread, Hillary Clinton is completely out-of-touch with veterans issues and the systemic mismanagement that has persisted under President Obamas failed leadership. Those who have served and wear the uniform today deserve to have a commander-in-chief who is looking out for them rather than donors and corrupt bureaucrats. Only Donald Trump and Mike Pence have a detailed plan to fundamentally improve both the VA and the way veterans are treated in this country. This ticket will always put our veterans and service members first, and they will put an end to the business as usual culture in Washington that leaves too many of our veterans behind.  Matt Miller, Director, Veterans for Trump

They apparently are selling our secrets to the highest bidder after they left being the traitor in State: Clinton sent classified material over email after leaving State Department
Fox News.com ^ | August 31, 2016
Posted on 8/31/2016, 1:35:01 PM by Kaslin Hillary Clinton apparently kept sending classified information over their personal email after leaving the State Department, according to documents obtained by the Republican National Committee. The file in question is a May 2013 email Clinton sent from their private account to State Department officials and aides discussing the 123 deal with the United Arab Emirates. Much of the message is redacted due to classified information. The markings list the material as confidential and say it can only be declassified in 2033. The email was first reported by The New York Post. Though the nature of the email exchange is unclear due to the redactions, the 123 deal referred to a 2009 agreement with the UAE to share material and technology for nuclear energy. As reported by the Post, the email came from Clintons hrod17@clintonemail.com account, and was sent to Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and others. It was sent months after Clinton left the department. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3464775/posts

most important ... From the bottom of the article, and perhaps... ---emphasis supplied--- Clinton Voted Against Veterans Funding While In The Senate In 2007, Clinton Voted Against The FY 2007 Iraq Emergency Spending Bill That Provided Nearly $1.8 Billion For Veterans Medical Care. (H.R. 2206, CQ Vote #181: Passed 80-14: R 42-3; D 37-10; I 1-1, 5/24/07, Clinton Voted Nay) In 2006, Clinton Voted Against Legislation That Would Have Added $20 Million For Veterans Health Care Facilities. To provide, with an offset, $20,000,000 for the Department of Veterans Affairs for Medical Facilities. (H.R. 4939, CQ Vote #111: Rejected 39-59: R 35-19; D 4-39; I 0-1, 5/4/06, Clinton Voted Nay) Valuable material for some Trump/Pence ads, eh?.

Magna Carta established for the first time the principle that everybody, including the sovereign, was subject to the law. The most famous clauses of Magna Carta declare that no free man shall be imprisoned without trial by their equals or by the law of the land, and that no-one shall be denied justice.
This 1217 copy of Magna Carta, exhibited in partnership with Hereford Cathedral, will be travelling a total of 65,000 miles to 9 cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, across 3 continents in a Global Tour organised by the GREAT campaign and made possible by the generous support of British Airways. It will be displayed alongside the only surviving copy of the King's Writ, a letter sent by King John from Runnymede in 1215 to royal officials in each English county, announcing the terms of Magna Carta.
The British Consul General, Caroline Wilson commented:
It is very meaningful to be able to bring Magna Carta to Hong Kong. This is a seminal legal document. Its principles have stood the test of time. They are corner stones for the legal systems of both the United Kingdom and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Magna Carta exhibition is the perfect occasion to celebrate our shared common law heritage and the close links between our legal systems. I hope that members of the public, including schoolchildren and students, will take the opportunity to see, with their own eyes, this historic document close up. And to learn about what it represents.
Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen also welcomed the tour and said:
The rule of law, which the Department of Justice has been doing its utmost to uphold, is the bedrock of Hong Kong's success. Our common law heritage is not just preserved but allowed to develop under the Basic Law which implements the principle of “One Country, Two Systems”. Magna Carta is an embodiment of a number of core values such as equality before the law and access to justice which the community of the Hong Kong SAR shares. In this regard, we are privileged to have an opportunity to be involved in one of the celebratory events for the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, which is the tour of its 1217 copy to the Hong Kong SAR, allowing the general public here to better understand the enduring relevance of the rule of law in a modern global context.
The Magna Carta will be flown from London to Hong Kong by British Airways and will be on display to the public from Wednesday 11 November to Saturday 14 November at Sotheby's Hong Kong Gallery, 5/F One Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Admiralty.
Noella Ferns, British Airways' regional general manager for Greater China and the Philippines said:
We are proud to be entrusted with flying this important document around the world for the global tour. We have nearly 80 years of history of flying between Hong Kong and London, and this is certainly one of the most precious pieces of cargo we've ever had the honour of carrying.
Kevin Ching, CEO of Sotheby's Asia, commented:
Sir Winston Churchill once hailed Magna Carta as a reaffirmation of a supreme law which is above the King and which even they must not break. Those who value the rule of law and due legal process have always held Magna Carta in the highest respect ever since its enactment. Sotheby's is honoured and proud to showcase this document of profound historical and cultural significance, also known as the Great Charter of Liberties, which is arguably the foundation of the great common law heritage of the Hong Kong SAR.
Notes to editors
The Magna Carta 800 Global Tour
The GREAT Britain campaign showcases the very best of what the UK has to offer and encourages people to visit, do business, invest and study in the UK. The GREAT campaign's Magna Carta Global Tour started with a public exhibition at the New York Historical Society in September. From there it travelled to its second stop in Luxembourg, where it was on display in the European Court of Justice. Magna Carta is currently in China where it will be exhibited in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou before coming to Hong Kong in mid-November. Following the Hong Kong leg the Magna Carta will travel to Singapore, Malta and Portugal.
Hereford Cathedral and Magna Carta
Hereford Cathedral has a special connection to the history of Magna Carta. In 1215, the Bishop of Hereford, Giles de Briouze, was the only bishop to join the other Magna Carta barons in rebellion against King John. Like other great English cathedrals, Hereford subsequently became home to a copy of Magna Carta and an original 1215 Kings Writ. Hereford is also home to the Mappa Mundi, the largest surviving Medieval World Map, and a unique medieval chained library, inspiration for the Hogwart's Restricted Library in the Harry Potter films. The Hereford Cathedral Magna Carta is one of only 18 believed to be in existence.
British Airways
British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, is one of the world's leading global premium airlines and the largest international carrier in the UK. The carrier has its home base at the award-winning London Heathrow Terminal 5, and flies to more than 70 different countries. British Airways celebrates its 80 years of flying to Hong Kong next year and currently operates two daily flights between London and Hong Kong offering customers a choice of four cabins. The route was one of the first to be operated by the airline's flagship A380 ‘superjumbo' aircraft, accommodating 469 passengers in First, Club World business class, World Traveller Plus and World Traveller.

NORTH BELLMORE, NY - It may have rained on the Bellmore Memorial Day Parade, but it did not dampen one local 11-year-old's spirit.
Nicholas DeGregorio, a fifth-grader at Newbridge Road Elementary School, was excited to march in the parade for the first time with their school's marching band on Monday, so they were disappointed to hear the parade was canceled due to the weather, according to their mother, Mary Bellissimo-DeGregorio.
"Nicholas felt so bad for all of the veterans that would not have a parade in honor of all their fallen comrades," Mary wrote in a message to Patch.
Since they couldn't play in the parade, the two drove the parade route with Nicholas playing their trumpet out the window for all to hear, until they ended up at the memorial by Newbridge Road School.
A woman then walked up to both of them and told them that their dad, Chris Iannacone, a disabled World War II veteran who came from West Hempstead for the parade, and their driver were on their way and wanted to know if the parade was still on.
They told them that it was canceled but that Nicholas would play "You're a Grand Old Flag" for them on their trumpet.
"He was thrilled and Nicholas was thrilled as well to have the opportunity to play for them and brighten their morning," Mary wrote. "Behind every cloud is a silver lining."
A video of Nicholas playing for Iannacone can be seen below.
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!- -&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
Are we trapped in the present, free to move in space yet unable to travel in the fourth dimension? Or is there a chance, a glimmer of a possibility, that the past and future could unfurl to our physical experience at will? Despite the punchline being apparent from the off – lest we forget, such journeys are impossible – James Gleick's latest offering sets out to question the questions, probing how the idea of time travel emerged, gripped our imaginations and shaped our society.
Our relationship with the slippery concept of time is far from static: technology continues to shape our view, even now
From the start it is apparent who's the hero of this journey. “One way or another, the inventions of HG Wells colour every time-travel story that followed,” writes Gleick, pointing out that while a smattering of earlier stories explored utopian futures, it was Wells who, with their 1895 work, got to the nuts and bolts of the matter in knocking up a time machine.
It's easy to forget that time travel is a relatively recent notion. As Gleick points out, for most of human history, change was incremental – yesterday looked much like today, today much like tomorrow. “Before futurism could be born, people had to believe in progress,” they write. The development of technology, culminating in the industrial revolution, made that possible. As change abounded, the future, and what it might look like, became a subject for speculation. And as archaeology burgeoned, writers like E Nesbit began flights of fancy to the past, too.
Embraced by novelists, wrestled with by philosophers and informed by science – not the least Hermann Minkowski's revelation, following Einstein's breakthrough, of four-dimensional spacetime – the possibility that the arrow of time could be tinkered with became a meme. From pulp fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein, to F Scott Fitzgerald and their The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, from Terminator to Dr Who, science fiction blossomed.
As Gleick reveals, problems and paradoxes immediately spewed forth. Is our future governed by fate, or free will? Does time travel always mean ending up naked, your clothes left in the present? What would happen if a time traveller killed their or their grandfather when they were a child? “All the paradoxes are time loops,” writes Gleick as they canvass the myriad responses to such conundrums. “They all force us to think about causality.”
Among those doing the thinking are philosophers and scientists. Attempting to tackle the idea that wormholes – tunnels in spacetime – could be turned into time machines allowing journeys into the past, even Stephen Hawking has entered the fray, concluding in their “chronology protection conjecture” that the laws of physics prevent it.

The consummate temporal tour guide, Gleick deftly navigates the twists and turns of our fascination with time travel, investigating its evolution in literature, exploring scientific principles that have hinted at or scotched the idea, and teasing apart the curious spell it cast across society with its suggestion of immortality.
But, as they note, not every product of this obsession with time was profound. “The time capsule is a characteristically 20th-century invention: a tragicomic time machine. It lacks an engine, goes nowhere, sits and waits,” they write, surveying various attempts to send snapshots of civilisation into the future. Indeed, it's hard to know whether disappointment, amusement or simply bafflement will be the dominant emotion when the Crypt of Civilisation time capsule at Oglethorpe in Atlanta is opened in 8113 AD. Created in 1936, its contents, Gleick reveals, include a movie magazine, an electric toaster and a “lady's breast form”.
Not every idea of time travel is rooted in the physical, and Gleick explores how in the act of storytelling we mess with chronology. “We don't have enough tenses. Or rather, we don't have enough names for all the tenses we create,” they write of the complexity unleashed in literature by the concept. Readers, too, become time travellers, able to move at will backwards and forwards through a story. More than that, Gleick argues, books cannot be detached from time. “Even if you know a book well – even if you can recite it entire, like the Homeric poet – you cannot experience it as a timeless object,” they write.
In probing the role of imagination and memory, Gleick also gives space to the concept of mental time travel, the phenomenon which allows us to immerse ourselves in our past and muse upon what the future might hold. But there, too, Gleick, drawing on Proust, uncovers complexity. “Our intelligence writes and rewrites again the story it is trying to recall,” they warn.

Time Travel is intoxicating, but that is only in part down to Gleick's execution. Much of this is well trodden ground, our enduring fascination with the notion sown long ago by many adroit hands. At times, Gleick seems to get lost in their own, sometimes opaque, musings. Parts of the book are frustratingly repetitive, while their practice of paraphrasing obscure time travel stories before analysing their finer points too often feels like the dinner party anecdote that rather feebly concludes “Well, you had to be there really”.
Exasperations aside, Time Travel reminds us that our relationship with the slippery concept of time is far from static: technology continues to shape our view, even now. “With persistent connectedness time gets tangled,” Gleick notes. With the internet, it seems, time ahead and time past are both brought into the present.

"Is your heart made of muscle or mud?" they asked, famously. They sent a junior court official to issue summons to Jayalalithaa in their Poes Garden home in the London Hotels case; there was a matter of their declaration of their religion. They were recruited to a post reserved for schedule caste Hindu by claiming to be a Hindu, although they were a Christian, married a Chrisitian woman, and is buried in Chennai. History is judging Ashok Kumar.
Justice Ashok Kumar passed away in 2009, but the controversy surrounding them is refusing to die down. Last week former Supreme Court Judge and press Council of India Chairman, Markandeya Katju unleashed a controversy with their sensational blog about a certain additional judge of the Madras High Court who, they said, was repeatedly given extensions and even made a permanent judge in 2007 despite disquiet over their integrity.
Bhama Devi Ravi is a Chennai based journalist
According to Katju, “That Judge had the solid support of a very important political leader of Tamil Nadu. I was told that this was because while a District Judge they granted bail to that political leader.” In short, Katju claimed that the political party that benefitted from that episode brought pressure on the UPA government to confirm the acting judge as a permanent one, thereby accusing the former central government of having interfered in judicial appointments.People in judicial and media circles were quick to zero in on the identity of Justice S. Ashok Kumar as the man Katju was referring to, with the incident referred to being June 29 2001 midnight arrest of DMK chief Mr. M Karunanidhi in the mini fly over scam case by the police when J Jayalalithaa was the chief minister of the state . Scenes of the midnight arrest of a feeble looking Karunanidhi, and other visuals of them sitting in the central jail premises, were repeatedly telecast by Sun TV.Midnight arrests were not new in Tamil Nadu's politics, since Jayalalithaa had suffered a similar fate in 1996, when DMK was in power. However, there was one difference, and that was Ashok Kumar. As the Prinicpal Sessions Judge, it was in their court that Karunanidhi was produced. Ashok Kumar made a stinging observation, quoted widely in the media. "Mr. Karunanidhi was made to wait before the Central Prison like a beggar. Everyone saw it. The whole world saw it on television.  They are a 78-year-old man suffering from various health ailments. Is your heart made of muscle or mud? What was the pressure on you?"By July 2001, Ashok Kumar had granted bail to MK Stalin and others accused in the flyover scam case. In April 2003, Ashok Kumar was made the Additional Judge of Madras High Court. This was the period when DMK was part of NDA at the Centre. From 2005, Ashok Kumar enjoyed extensions, and when they were due for retirement, they were made a permanent judge with the UPA government at the Centre and the DMK was now an important ally. They were moved to the Andhra Pradesh High Court in March 2008, retired four months later and died in October the same year.Ashok Kumar's extension and confirmation were so controversial that the same were challenged in the Supreme Court on at least two occasions, but the apex court observed that ‘successive chief justices' had recommended Ashok Kumar. There are also reports that adverse remarks against Ashok Kumar were also struck down from official records on the recommendation of an acting judge. Controversy dogged Ashok Kumar throughout their career.Justice Ashok Kumar was born in 1947 to Christian Dalit parents in a small village in Tirunelveli District in Tamil Nadu. After basic education and masters degree from reputed institutions, Ashok Kumar graduated in law from the Dr Ambedkar Law College , Chennai. They were a direct recruit as a District Judge to a post reserved for Hindu Scheduled Caste, based on their declaration that they were a converted Hindu.Senior advocates from Coimbatore, where they were a Trainee District Judge in 1987, remember them as “pleasant” but also point out that they already had a negative reputation. During the early days they gained reputation as a capable Judge – who can do Justice to their role, if not ‘compromised' beforehand.After being moved through several districts they were posted to Chennai, where they famously granted bail to M. Karunanidhi and MK Stalin in the flyover corruption case, possibly endearing themselves to the family which was pushing for their posting as a permanent judge of the Madras High Court. A senior advocate also recalls that towards the end of their career they would come to court, ‘in a wheelchair.'In some ways Indian judiciary is also handicapped, feel some in the field. The entire controversy over Ashok Kumar is due to political overlay. Typically, a judicial posting should be above reproach, and follow norms, without fear or favour. The Collegiums (chief justice and senior judges ) should be allowed to prepare a list for judges' posts without external influence. A senior advocate says “In the olden days the judiciary was very independent. For example, during the days when K Kamaraj was the chief minister, if chief justice Rajamannar drew up a list, the government wouldn't touch the list but just approve it. That is how 'Kamaraj rule' came to be a phrase representative of justice in public life. Today, there is only political interference,” they feel.

Heading a high-ranking delegation, Baqeri left Tehran for Damascus late on Tuesday and held talks with their Syrian counterpart, General Ali Abdullah Ayoub, and Defense Minister Major General Fahd Jassem al-Freij during their trip to the war-torn country on Wednesday.
Iranian chief commander also met with Syrian President Bashar Assad on Thursday while on Friday theirs inspected various battlefields of fighting with terrorists in Syria.
Tuesday at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly got into a heated exchange over funding for sanctuary cities.

KELLY: But I am trying to answer the questions.
THE vast oil reserves and disputed status of Kirkuk have given it a reputation as a powder-keg. The multi-ethnic province in northern Iraq lies beyond the Kurdish Autonomous Region but is ruled by the Kurds and claimed by the Arabs in Baghdad. To locals, the ambiguity has had its advantages. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters provided security; Iraq's government footed the bill (which it refused to the undisputed Kurdish enclave further north). For years Kirkuk's heterogeneous population has largely left Iraq's identity wars at the city gates and continued their polyglot ways. Kurds, Turkmen and Arabs happily jumbled their different languages in the cafes. Flush with funds and oil wealth, malls and fancy restaurants sprouted along its roads. The province has a Kurdish governor. Peshmerga fighters, who swept in with the Americans in 2003, have the upper hand, but most of the province's officials are still Arabs.
The tinderbox never really caught fire. But a unilateral referendum the Kurds have called for their independence on September 25th might change that. Rival Kurdish and Arab forces are converging on the province, and its often nonchalant people say they are scared. Masoud Barzani, the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, sounds unrelenting in their determination to hold the referendum, not just in the three provinces of their Kurdish Regional Government but in Kirkuk and vast swathes of other provinces their forces have seized from the jihadists of Islamic State. Iraq's prime minister, Haider Abadi, has denounced the ballot as unconstitutional and prevailed on parliament to sack Kirkuk's governor, Najmaldin Karim, for backing the vote. The province's status, they say, should be determined by dialogue, not an unauthorised Kurdish ballot. Hundreds of Kurds in senior government posts, including two ministers and several ambassadors, risk losing their job. Parliament is considering a vote of no confidence in Iraq's president, a Kurd. And Iraq's army and its allied Shia hashad, or militia, are mobilising. A leader of Badr, the largest and best armed of the militias, vows to prevent any poll and says their forces will march on Kirkuk next week, en route to Hawija, IS's last holding in central Iraq. The operation, they say, is set to begin on September 23rd, two days before the scheduled referendum. Foreign aid workers in the city are planning to leave town.
Still at their desk, Kirkuk's Kurdish governor is defiant. “The same Peshmerga who stopped IS entering the city, will stop the hashad,” insists Mr Karim. They echo Mr Barzani, who says Kirkuk is Kurdish, and that “the people of Kurdistan are willing to die to defend it.” The two-metre deep trench and four-metre high earth wall which Kurds built with western assistance to block IS from taking the oilfields will serve to keep Shia militiamen at bay, they say, and mark the borders of Kurdistan's future state. Some Kurds threaten to cut Iraq's water supply from the dams they control on the Tigris if the fighting begins.
But the opposing force is formidable. After three years as the vanguard fighting IS, Shia paramilitary forces are battle-hardened, well-armed and flush with at least $1bn of Iraqi government finance. By contrast, the Kurdish government lacks the cash to pay its Peshmerga full salaries.

Kirkuk is just one of several flashpoints stretching west to Sinjar, and up the Euphrates into Syria, where Arab and Kurdish forces compete to fill the vacuum left by IS. The eruption of one could ignite them all. Regional powerbrokers are pressuring the Kurds. Hakan Fidan, the Turkish intelligence chief, and Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran's Quds force, Iran's foreign legion, have been touring Kurdistan warning against a vote. Iran briefly dammed a river into Kurdistan over the summer, “for technical reasons”, says the Iranian consul in Kurdistan. But Kurds have been told that their three border crossings with Iran could shut, too, if the referendum goes ahead.
Mr Barzani had hoped their Western allies, who first backed the creation of a Kurdish enclave in 1991, would come to the rescue of land-locked Kurdistan. But the Americans are clear they are giving priority to Iraq's future over that of the Kurds. They fear the referendum will jeopardise the Kurdish-Arab alliance they have stitched together against IS's “caliphate”, potentially offering the jihadists a lease of life just as it seemed on the point of collapse. Also visiting Kurdistan, Brett McGurk, the American envoy to the coalition, warned Kurdish politicians not to expect financial, diplomatic or military support if fighting erupted. At a meeting with Mr Barzani on September 14th, a phalanx of Western ambassadors to Iraq nodded at theirs side.
Kurds themselves are deeply divided. Mr Barzani has staged sizeable flag-waving rallies on their home turf of Erbil and Dohuk, the two provinces ruled by their Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). But elsewhere many fear Mr Barzani is gambling with their enclave. The streets of Kirkuk and Suleimaniyah provinces ruled by Mr Barzani's old rival, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), are pointedly bereft of campaign posters and bunting. Walking through Sulaimaniyah's city market, this correspondent could not find a single Kurd planning to vote. After 26 years of self-rule, many doubt their rulers' ability to run a state. Its military forces are divided between several factions, parliament has been padlocked for two years after it sought to wrest powers from the president, whose 12-year tenure should have expired four years ago.
The enclave is over $20bn in debt. Despite seizing Kirkuk's oilfields and exporting at least 300,000 barrels they produce per day via Turkey, Mr Barzani's government slashed salaries and is many months in arrears. Civil servants at the Shaab café in Sulaimaniyah complained Mr Barzani had called the referendum as a smokescreen to hide their government's internal woes. Remarkably, in a region still traumatised by Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons, a peddler proudly sold old Iraqi banknotes with the dictator's face. The rule of Saddam's family, they said, was better than Mr Barzani's. Even a student hawking Kurdish flags to fund their studies said the Middle East was better without another failed state.
Mr Barzani might blink. They recalled parliament on September 15th after a two-year hiatus. It may yet vote to postpone the referendum, allowing Mr Barzani to blame MPs for the U-turn. But many Kurdish politicians are dismayed by their brinkmanship. Of all the Middle East's 30m Kurds, Iraq's 6m enjoy the most rights. Now many fears that the autonomy they have preserved for 26 years is at stake.
Some point to a precedent. In 1946, Masoud Barzani's father, Mustafa, led Kurdish forces in declaring a Kurdish republic in the Iranian town of Mahabad. After losing international support, it collapsed in less than a year.
Ousted FBI Director James Comey will testify June 8 before the Senate intelligence committee as part of its ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 elections.
Comey's testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. EST June 8. Watch live in the player above or on your local PBS station.
Comey, who was fired May 9 by President Donald Trump, is expected to speak about how their agency assessed Russia's role in November's election.
Trump drew criticism for removing Comey from their position while Comey was leading an active investigation into Russia's role in the elections as well as possible ties to members of Trump's campaign.

Senators will also likely ask Comey about their relationship with the president in the weeks leading up to theirs firing.
The former FBI director was cleared to testify this week by Robert Mueller, the special counsel now overseeing the agency's investigation.
Senate intelligence chair Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., along with vice chair Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va, said in a statement that Comey's public testimony will be followed by a closed session with the committee later that day.
Meanwhile, the House intelligence committee has issued more subpoenas in its own probe into Russia, including for Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz.

US President Donald Trump has welcomed a Supreme Court ruling allowing their travel ban to be partly reinstated as a "victory for our national security".
America's highest court also granted a White House request allowing part of its refugee ban to go into effect.
The justices said they would consider in October whether the president's policy should be upheld or struck down.
Mr Trump seeks to place a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on refugees.
The president welcomed the ruling's qualified authorisation to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, which they described as "terror-prone countries".
"As president, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm," they added.
Mr Trump has already said the ban would take effect within 72 hours of court approval.
What does the ruling say?
The Supreme Court said in Monday's decision: "In practical terms, this means that [the executive order] may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.
"All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of [the executive order]."
The ruling also said it would permit a 120-day ban on all refugees entering the US to go into effect, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who do not have any "bona fide relationship" with an American individual or entity.
A Trump win - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
Mark this down as a win for Donald Trump. The path to entry into the US for immigrants and refugees from the affected nations, if they don't have existing ties to the US - either through family, schools or employment - just became considerably harder.
The decision marks a reaffirmation of the sweeping powers the president has traditionally been granted by the courts in areas of national security. There was fear in some quarters that the administration's ham-fisted implementation of its immigration policy could do lasting damage to the president's prerogatives. That appears not to be the case.
The government, the justices write, has a "compelling need to provide for the nation's security". That includes being able to close the borders based on an evaluation of the potential of foreign threats - at least for now.
The Supreme Court justices will fully consider the arguments on both sides next autumn. Of course, by that time it may not matter. The administration has three months to conduct its "executive review" of immigration policy and devise new guidelines.
In the meantime, the gates to America just got a bit smaller.
Big win for Trump and their travel ban
What does 'bona fide' relationship mean?
The ruling clarifies that those who would be deemed to have such a relationship would include a foreign national who wishes to enter the US to live with or visit a family member, a student at an American university, an employee of a US company, or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.
This would not apply, it said, to "someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid [the executive order].
"For example, a non-profit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion."

Are there any divisions on the court?
Yes. Three of the court's conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - wrote that they would have allowed the travel ban to go into full effect.
Justice Thomas said the government's interest in preserving national security outweighs any hardship to people denied entry into the country.
Mr Trump restored a 5-4 conservative majority to the Supreme Court when their nominee, Justice Gorsuch, joined its bench in April.
There are five Republican appointees on the court and four Democratic appointees.
What has the reaction been?
Attorney General Jeff Sessions says "the threat to our national security is real and becoming increasingly dangerous". They have welcomed the decision, saying it is "an important step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government."
Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants' Rights Project, says that it remains to be decided if the ban is constitutional, but that the courts which have looked at the measure have been against it: "[But] in practical terms most of the people who stood to be affected by the ban will still be allowed to come in."
David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), has urged the government to start a review of its vetting process. "The court's decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the US: people with urgent medical conditions blocked, innocent people left adrift, all of whom have been extensively vetted."
What did lower courts say?
The US president insisted their ban was necessary for national security amid a slew of terrorist attacks in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin and other cities. However, critics called the policy un-American and Islamophobic, and the lower courts broadly seemed to agree.
The president's policy was left in limbo after it was struck down by federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland days following its issuance on 6 March.
The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said in May the ban was "rooted in religious animus" toward Muslims.
The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in June: "National security is not a 'talismanic incantation' that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power."

Why did Trump revise the order?
The original ban, released on 27 January, provoked mass protests at American airports.
It included Iraq among nations whose travellers would be barred from the US, and imposed a full ban on refugees from Syria.
The president issued a revised version with a narrower scope on 6 March to overcome some of the legal problems.
But Mr Trump was unhappy about having to do so, calling it a "watered down, politically correct" version of the first one.
If you've never thought about how a whale's poo affects you, the time is now.
Why? Because the faecal matter of whales, oversized land mammals, seabirds and migrating fish plays a critical role in fertilising the planet.
Whales can act as a "distribution pump," transporting vital nutrients like phosphorus from the ocean floor to the surface, however their ability to do so has reduced by more than 75 per cent. Credit:Tribune
But a new study shows species decline and extinction is threatening the planet's age-old 'biogeochemical cycling' system (or nutrient recycling system), potentially weakening ecosystem health, fisheries and agriculture.
"Previously, animals were not thought to play an important role in nutrient movement," said Christopher Doughty, an ecologist at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study Global nutrient transport in a world of giants.
Lybrate Inc. is striving to become the go-to digital platform for patients to discuss health-related issues and for doctors to connect with one another.
The health-tech startup allows users to book audio, video or in-person consultations with doctors and ask health-related questions for free through its website and mobile app. The startup raised $10.2 million in funding last year and counts Tiger Global, Nexus Venture Partners and Ratan Tata among its investors. Founded in 2013, the company set out with the mission of solving three major issues in healthcare â€“ limited time, availability of doctors and social stigmas attached to certain ailments. Lybrate co-founder and CEO Saurabh Arora explains how Lybrate operates and shares the company's growth plans. Excerpts:
What is your business model and how do you earn revenue?
We enable patients to book a consultation with a doctor of their choice from across the country and charge them a consultation fee. This is the source of revenue from the patient's side. We believe the number one thing in healthcare is trust and privacy. We ensure privacy because Lybrate is an anonymous platform. Trust is created because doctors' complete detailed profiles are available along with the fee amount.
Lybrate has services for doctors as well. Lybrate Cube is a comprehensive practice management software, which goes beyond managing appointments, electronic medical records, e-prescription, scheduling, etc. Most follow-up visits are not required and a doctor's time comes at a premium. With this platform, doctors can consult their patients online. That's our second revenue model. Our revenue grew six-fold in 2016-17.
It's been one-and-a-half years since you last raised funding. How have you deployed the funds?
We have not spent all the money yet. Most funds have been deployed for meeting manpower requirements. Right now, we're not actively looking for funding.
Lybrate seems to have a special interest in creating content. There's a health feed section and a blog. Where is the company headed with this?
We call it the 'Quora for health', where users can ask questions for free and doctors will reply. By making it free, we saw massive adoption and people started to get informed not from search engines but from a qualified medical expert. The way we do it is we have qualified doctors on our platform, and on the backend, we use machine learning. You can just open Lybrate and post a query to get a response. It's that easy.
Internet connectivity is still patchy in India. What kind of traffic do you get?
We get 60% traffic from the top eight cities, including metros, and 40% from smaller cities and towns. About 50% of our traffic is repeat traffic. We target our users much better because we understand user behaviour such as what they or they may like in terms of health content. That is something which was not done before. We are expecting growth as things have improved over time, like the proliferation of smartphones and reduced data rates.
How do you plan to grow?
One is the healthcare data itself, which is huge and powerful. Data is collected from users on the platform; for example, if they're diabetic. They interact with the health feed, giving signals about what they like and don't like. There is so much power in that data if used, without actually involving the users. One can see a lot of trends and insights about an area or a disease. Data such as prescriptions, users' queries and interest level on health care information can be used in different ways, including improving the ultimate outcome.
We also want to launch a health analytics platform, where we could see trends and disease-level data, which can be useful for many other people.
Healthcare is not moving toward in-person consultation with doctors. That is going to reduce in the future because visits themselves are not required. Currently, you are forced to go because there is no other alternative. Today, at any hospital, in the queue, 70% are follow-up visits. They're not required.
What little historical records we have pertaining to Queen Eadgifu tell us they exercised considerable power. They were the third wife of Edward the Elder, son of Alfred the Great. While they didn't have much prominence during the life of their husband or their stepson Aethelstan, they came to exert their influence during the reigns of their sons and grandsons. They were the first important queen of the tenth century due to their landed interests and to their role in the family politics of the time.
The best estimate of a birthdate for Eadgifu is c. 901. They were the daughter of Ealdorman Sigehelm of Kent. They owned extensive and widespread landholdings in Kent and held Minster in Thanet, and possibly Ely. Edward the Elder had been living with a woman named Ecgwynn at this father's court. We don't know for sure they were married to Ecgwynn but they had two children with her, Aethelstan and an unnamed daughter. In 901, when Edward had been king for two years, they had a new wife named Aelflaed. Together they had at least eight children, two sons and six daughters. Around 919-920, Edward set aside Aelflaed and they became a nun at Wilton where they were joined by two of their daughters. It was at this time Edward married Eadgifu, most likely to gain control of their landholdings since they already had plenty of heirs.
Eadgifu would have been around twenty at the time of their marriage. They were called seo hlæfdige or The Lady of Wessex. They had a son named Edmund who was born in 920/1 and another son Eadred, born in 921/2. They also had at least two daughters. Eadburh was a nun who died c. 960 and Elgiva married Louis, King of Arles. Eadgifu gained more lands during their marriage due to grants from Edward. Edward was to die in July of 924, leaving Eadgifu a widow with young children.
There were three half-brothers to their children who stood to succeed to the throne before their sons; Aethelstan, Edward's eldest son by their first wife and then there was Edwin and Aethelweard by Edward's second wife. Aethelweard died shortly after their father in 924 and Edwin died in a mysterious drowning in 933. The succession after Edward's death was not truly settled for about a year when Aethelstan finally secured their position as king. Eadgifu probably lived as an obscure widow during the reign of Aethelstan, bringing up their children at court. But by the end of Aethelstan's reign, they had maneuvered themselves into a better position because Aethelstan named their sons as their heirs. Aethelstan may or may not have promised not to marry in order to secure their succession.
At the Battle of Brunanburh in 937, King Aethelstan was victorious and Eadgifu's son Edmund fought at their side. Aethelstan reigned for two more years and died in October of 939. Edmund succeeded them as king at the age of eighteen. Eadgifu appears to have gained sudden prominence in the 940's after a long period where West Saxon queens remained in obscurity. Them power derived from their status as a widow and the mother of the king. They had more power during their son Edmund's reign that they ever had before. Edmund was married twice and they eclipsed both their wives, maintaining their power and position.
It is unlikely they were designated as the actual regent for their sons.  They are commonly called The King's Mother in documents from the period. Eadgifu appears in witness lists as one of the most regularly recorded witnesses of diplomas and charters during Edmund's reign and is the only woman in the lists. And their name appears directly after the king's. This meant they were included in the hierarchy of the newly expanded kingdom of their sons.
King Edmund was known as the “Magnificent”. They were a great warrior and possibly had a fondness for spectacle. They were stabbed to death in a brawl at Pucklechurch near Bath in 946. Their two sons Eadwig and Edgar were too young to rule so their brother Eadred succeeded them as king. Eadred suffered from some kind of stomach ailment and had trouble swallowing. But their illness didn't affect their ability to rule and they were a strong warrior. They united the kingdom of England once again after some rifts had occurred.
Eadgifu witnessed even more charters during the reign of Eadred, most granting land to laity and the church. They were a patron of the monastic revival and reform in England. It was always beneficial to garner the support of the saints and the church for one's family. They influenced their sons to support the church reforms. Payments were frequent between kings, queens and churchmen during this time. They assisted in advancing bishops like Dunstan and Athelwold who were significant in driving the reforms. They maintained a high degree of power during Eadred's reign by making an alliance with Dunstan. Eadred had no wife to challenge their position. After a long illness, Eadred died at Frome, Somerset on November 23, 955.
With the death of their son, Eadgifu's position was perilous. Them power was at the mercy of any shift in influence. There was a struggle between their two grandsons Eadwig and Edgar, both teenagers. Eadwig declared their position as king and planned to marry a woman of royal descent named Aelfgifu. They were Eadwig's third cousin once removed. Dunstan didn't approve of Eadwig marrying a woman they were so closely related to and started working to replace Eadwig with their brother Edgar. Eadgifu may have supported Dunstan in this plan. Neither one of them wanted to give up what power they had. With the support of some noblemen, Eadwig sent Dunstan into exile from court as well as from the kingdom. They also seized Eadgifu's lands.
Eadgifu disappeared from court and the record. When Eadwig died suddenly in 959, Edgar asserted their position as king and restored Eadgifu's land to them Them role as queen/regent was through and they were rarely at court after 959, most likely in a nunnery. They came out of retirement in 966 to attend a meeting granting additional privileges to the New Minster at Winchester. There was also a family celebration to recognize the legitimacy of Edgar's new son, born to their third wife Aelfthryth.
Eadgifu's reputation has been heightened by the supportive position they play in the Lives of Dunstan and Athelwold. They were very interested in acquiring churches and land and actively promoted the extension of West Saxon power. They may have been, for all intents and purposes a regent in Kent. Eadgifu survived their husband Edward by over forty years. It is believed they died c. 966/7. They were associated with the monastery at Wilton and may have been buried there.

The car now moves on to Station 2 – Body Alignment, where the tub chassis is loaded on to this jig……
…..and these parts, and many more, are attached to the chassis.
By the end of this stage in production, you'll see something that looks a lot like a real car body. It's somewhat of an illusion, however, as all the component parts you'll see will be removed from the car again prior to Station 3. Station 2 exists primarily to assemble all the body parts and adjust them so that they all align properly with the right panel gaps and level surfaces. Once they're aligned, the various body parts will be removed again and sent to Station 3, for preparation and paint.
So….. the tub chassis is mounted on to the jig to begin.
Below is the engine/gearbox subframe jig – part of the larger jig structure – which we use to ensure correct placement of parts during this process.
The engine and gearbox subframes on our cars are connected directly to the tub chassis and this whole assembly, including the engine itself, contributes significantly to the stiffness of the car.
It's essential to have these subframe jigs in place during this fitting process, but note that these subframe jig parts are not the final parts that will be used on the car.
Before we attach the large panels that make it appear more car-like, a number of smaller parts have to go on the chassis first. All these and more will be attached to the car during this part of the process.
The bracket being fitted below is a hub that supports a lot of the engine mount framework. The correct placement of this part onto the chassis tub is crucial, which is why we use the engine/gearbox sub-frame jig (above) to re-create all the points that the framework is connected to. By having the correct receiving-end connection points in place, we ensure that the bracket placement on the tub is right where it needs to be.
The bracket is test-fitted and the framework beams are attached between it and the sub-frame jig.
The bracket will be both bolted and bonded into place so the surface is prepared for bonding before final fitting takes place.
The framework looks like this when it's all in place….
Here's an image from a car further down the production line. You can see from this image how the framework interacts with the engine.
The pieces you see below are all templates we use for marking and/or cutting different areas of the car. They're all 3D printed pieces, made using the same CAD drawings we use for the parts they're applied to.
Here you see some of them in place. These are used to cut holes for the housings that secure our removable roof.
Once they're in place, the appropriate holes are marked and then cut out with a rotary tool. In the pictures below, Richard is cutting the hole for the housing that goes into the rollbar, at the back of the cockpit.
When the hole is cut and cleaned, they can then do a test fitting of the housing.
The hinges for the front and rear hood are fitted next…..
The rocker panel is fitted next, below. This is the first of the exterior body panels fitted to the car. The rocker panels and the roof are both important reference points for body alignment as they're central points on the car where several other areas meet. In the case of the rocker panel, it meets the door, the rear hood and the front hood. It might look quite humble, but the rocker panel is actually a crucial point of panel alignment for the vehicle.
You can see our Dihedral Synchrohelix door actuation hinge below.
This is one of the few instances where we accept a small weight penalty in the name of functionality. Our hinge weighs more than a typical door hinge, but it is a piece of cutting edge design and is actually super-light for the benefits it delivers. The Dihedral Synchrohelix system opens the door outwards and upwards in one smooth, sweeping motion. It's as practical as it is beautiful; it takes less external horizontal space than a traditional door and less vertical space than a gullwing or scissor door. We think it's prettier, too.
Any minor weight penalty is well and truly offset by the fact that our doors are featherweights compared to others.
Here's a video of our door in action, as fitted to one of our earlier cars, a CCR. The system has been in place, virtually unchanged, from the CC8S.
With the door fitted to the hinge system, Richard can start making preliminary adjustments for fit. Adjustments can be made both at the hinge and at the catch on the B-pillar.
With the doors in place, work begins on extending outwards front and rear from the tub chassis. First, the front subframe is attached to the tub chassis.
The sections that make up the front bumper support can then be fitted to the subframe.
The rear bumper has been fitted to the jig in the photo above.
With the front bumper also fitted, all of a sudden the Koenigsegg silhouette is starting to take shape.
With the front hood yet to be fitted, I thought it was a good stage to take a photo that would illustrate some of the detail that does into the design of our carbon fiber parts here at Koenigsegg. The photo below shows parts of the tub chassis and parts of the front bumper support that have just been fitted to the car. You can see the various thicknesses of carbon fiber marked by the numbers in the image below. Click to enlarge.
Each part is designed to be as thick (strong) as it needs to be, both for the function that it performs and for the safety of the car as a whole. By paying attention to every detail, the car is no heavier than necessary but has all the strength that it needs. There'll be more lightweight detail further down.
The rear hood is the next part to be fitted. It's not particularly heavy but it's a large piece and very expensive so the guys from Station 1 are called in for support.
Again, adjustments for fit can be made at all the various connection points to ensure proper alignment and fit.
With the front hood fitted (not closed in the photo, below), we now have something that really looks like a Koenigsegg. Note that an outline for the indicator has been traced onto the front bumper using another of the 3D-printed templates. The front side indicator is a requirement for the US market only.
Templates are used once again to mark the slots to be cut for the front winglets and the centre support for the front splitter. The holes are cut with a rotary tool.
Once the hole is cut for the front/side indicator, the 3D template is used again to sand the edges and make sure they're a perfect fit.
The roof will arrive shortly, but we've now got all the basic bodily elements of the Koenigsegg Agera RS in place and ready for final alignment, gap checking, etc. The car looks quite spectacular, even at this early stage of the build.
The roof is the final piece of the puzzle and once it is fitted to the car, the full alignment and gapping process can begin.
The first stage is to check that all panels align with one another so that it's a smooth flow from panel to panel.
Our parts are made of carbon fiber and are of a level of complexity that precludes simplistic mass production. Every part, therefore, has to be custom-fitted to the car under construction. The whole process is very human-centric, befitting a car that is designed solely with the driver in mind.
Adjustments are being made to the rear hood, above. The same thing happens all around the car until the flow from panel to panel is correct.
Next, panel gaps are inspected and adjusted and/or sanded to ensure consistency around the car.
The final job at Station 2 involves pre-installation of a number of interior pieces. These pieces will go to the trim shop later for upholstering and won't be back on the car for some time, but it's good to ensure proper fitment of these parts at this early stage of the build process.
This is our interior dashboard panel. Like everything else, it's made of carbon fibre to save weight. It is typically trimmed with leather or alcantara before final installation into the car.
The white 3D-printed pieces ensure that it's located correctly prior to the pilot holes being drilled.
The top covers for the ventilation system are also test fitted as part of this process…..
This corner piece goes at the point where the hood and dashboard meet the A-pillar. It has three contact points with the rest of the car so precision fitting is tricky.
Both the part and points it will be attached to are resurfaced in order to ensure the perfect fit.
This piece is another example of Koenigsegg's complete commitment to light weight and performance. The piece you see being fitted now is another trim piece. It will be completely covered by interior fabric and will never be visible to the human eye in the uncovered state you see here. It could have been made from the cheapest solid material available and no-one would ever know. But it isn't, because every gram is precious and that means that even invisible parts like this are made by hand from carbon fiber.
The interior guys come to check their parts regularly during this final part of the process, just to make sure they're happy with the fit. There has to be adequate space for extra materials to be laid over the pieces and still maintain appropriate interior panel gaps.
——
That is all from Station 2.
The next part of the process actually begins at this station, as well. We'll save that for our next entry, but this photo should give you an idea……
Thanks for joining us for the build of Koenigsegg Agera RS #128.

I was a little bummed that I didn't receive a gift from my original santa but I was excited to be matched with my rematch santa... I waited and waited a couple of months and still nothing until I got a message saying that the rematch santa was so sorry for keeping me waiting. BOY WAS I GLAD THAT I WAITED. I received a canister of Teavana Blueberry Bliss Tea which smelled amazing, as well as 4 records which were all amazing.
Daft Punk - Alive 1997 unfortunately I had this already but I cannot believe my santa was this nice! Lucero - Women and Work a local band from the santa's hometown of memphis The Smithereens - Especially For You Santa's friend said the album was good and santa trusts friend so I trust friend Toto - Toto IV - no intro needed!!!!!
After actor and comedian Kapil Sharma tweeted this morning stating that they were asked to pay Rs. 5lakhs as bribe by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation BMC ) for making an office in the city it has come to light that unauthorized construction done by the actor in their property at Andheri in July this year has been demolished by the civic body on August 4.BMC local ward office -K-west, has claimed that the actor was issued a stop work notice for their ground plus one storied structure at Andheri –west where they had built an additional second floor and also extended the rear side of the ground floor in July this year. The K west assistant municipal commissioner Parag Masurkar told TOI, “The stop work notice was given for the unauthorized horizontal extension to the existing ground plus one storied structure. On August 4 after receiving no reply from the actor the same was demolished.”In a tweet put out today from their official handle the actor said, "I am paying 15 cr income tax from last 5 year n still i have to pay 5 lacs bribe to BMC office for making my office @narendramodi."BMC chief engineer-vigilance, Manohar Pawar has said the actor would need to provide them with additional details on the matter. "He must have made these allegations with some base hence we need them to provide us with all the evidence they might have and the name of the official . Depending on the same action would be initiated," said Pawar.
It has been 10,000 years since prehistoric elephants roamed the earth. Now an audacious band of scientists hopes to recreate a living, breathing woolly mammoth.
"It's amazing days isn't it?" American Museum of Natural History mammal curator Ross McPhee said. "The idea that you might be able to reach back into the past and pull out the genetic code of an extinct mammal like a woolly mammoth and somehow with modern technology recreate it."
The scientists plan to extract cell nuclei from a frozen mammoth they dug up in Siberia and implant them in egg cells of the mammoth's closest living relative, the elephant. They are hoping that the elephant will give birth to a real-live woolly mammoth.
Plans to resurrect the mammoth have been in place since 1997. During three separate studies, a research team from Kinki University in Japan obtained mammoth skin and muscle tissue excavated in good condition from the permafrost in Siberia.
But they soon discovered that most nuclei in the cells were damaged by ice crystals and were unusable. So the project was abandoned, according to the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbum.
Japanese researchers said in 2008 that they successfully cloned a mouse from a body that had been frozen for 16 years, which they claimed theoretically opened the door to preserving endangered animals and resurrecting extinct animals such as the woolly mammoth.
Minoru Miyashita, a professor at Kinki University, was asked last spring to join the project. They have petitioned zoos to donate elephant egg cells when their female elephants die so more research can be done.
If all goes according to plan, an elephant will be giving birth to a woolly mammoth in the next five to six years, Yomiuri Shimbum reported.
Behold, the Woolly Mammoth!
Some people think bringing this mammoth back to life is a great idea.
"It's the most adorable kind of cloning, because anything that's woolly [is] adorable," one supporter said.
Others prefer to leave the past alone and let the furry beasts rest in peace.
"It sounds to me like you're a little bit messing with the laws of nature," a skeptic told ABC News.
Even McPhee is a bit skeptical of genetic material's ability to survive after so many years.
"You can't really expect something that's 10 to 20,000 years old to have enough of its nucleus preserved," they said.

Chelsea have sacked Roberto Di Matteo as manager just hours after their Champions League defeat to Juventus.
The club announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning that they had parted company with the Italian after a string of poor results. Shortly afterwards they released a statement, stating that results had not been good enough and an announcement on a new manager will be made shortly.
Chelsea's statement read: "Chelsea football club has parted company this morning with manager Roberto Di Matteo. The team's recent performances and results have not been good enough and the owner and the board felt that a change was necessary now to keep the club moving in the right direction as we head into a vitally important part of the season.
"The club faces a difficult task ahead in qualifying for the knockout stages of the Uefa Champions League as well as maintaining a strong challenge for the top of the Premier League while competing in three other cup competitions. Our aim is to remain as competitive as possible and challenge strongly on all fronts."
It continued: "The owner and the board would like to thank Roberto for all they have done for the club since taking over in March. Roberto helped guide us to an historic Champions League victory and a seventh FA Cup. We will never forget the huge contribution they have made to this club's history and they will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge.
"The club will be making an announcement shortly regarding a new first team manager."
Di Matteo took charge of Chelsea in March after the club had sacked André Villas-Boas, initially on a temporary basis. Di Matteo rescued the club's ailing Champions League campaign and steered them to victory over Bayern Munich in the final on the German team's home ground, having already secured the FA Cup.
The new season started well domestically but they have fallen slightly off the pace in recent weeks. Di Matteo has become the first top-flight manager to leave their post this season, having been 33-1 with bookmakers to "win" the Premier League sack race barely 36 hours ago.
Chelsea have already sounded out Rafael Benítez to determine their willingness to take over on a short-term contract, with the former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola the first choice if they can be persuaded to return to work having stated they wanted a year-long sabbatical last May.
Guardiola was a reported target for Chelsea in the summer despite Di Matteo's Champions League and FA Cup success. They had vowed to take a year's break from the game, but they are likely to be the favourite to succeed Di Matteo on a permanent basis.
Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez says Paul Dummett faces two weeks out through injury
Paul Dummett was forced off with an injury in Newcastle's opening game of the season against Tottenham
Newcastle centre-back Paul Dummett could be out for two weeks, according to manager Rafa Benitez.
Dummett was forced off after just seven minutes of Newcastle's opening Premier League defeat at home to Tottenham, live on Sky Sports Football, and was clutching their right hamstring.
The Welshman's centre-back partner - new signing Florian Lejuene - was also withdrawn with an injury in the first half before Jonjo Shelvey was sent off and the hosts lost 2-0.
Boss Benitez said: "We don't know [the prognosis]. It's too early. The main thing is we lost two players and we had to adapt.
2:56 Newcastle 0-2 Tottenham Newcastle 0-2 Tottenham
"We have to wait but a couple of weeks, one of them, for sure. Maybe Dummett. I don't know."
Benitez admitted that Shelvey made a mistake in standing on the ankle of Dele Alli, which caused their sending off, but the Spaniard said Harry Kane's tackle from behind on Lejuene was worse.
Dummett now faces a two-week spell on the sidelines, according to Rafa Benitez
"I think it's worse because I had to change one player and Dele Alli has nothing," Benitez said.
"We watched the replay from the bench, with the fourth official and everyone. Surprise. But the rules are the rules and we paid for that.
"Jonjo knows they have made a mistake and they apologised but we lost the game."
Hey, welcome aboard! How does it feel to be joining Liquid? What made you want to take on this new challenge?
Having this opportunity is the greatest feeling. I am ready to take on new challenges when coming into Team Liquid. I have worked extremely hard these past couple months on improving myself, being much more consistent and becoming a better player/person. The main reason I wanted to join Team Liquid is because I see it as a big stepping stone in my career. It gives me more experience as well. I'm very thankful to have this opportunity, thanks Liquid and to those who have supported me.
When looking at the Liquid roster how do you see yourself fitting in?
I see myself fitting in as a Coldzera type support player. This is a role that I do like along with lurking. In this scenario, however, Liquid already have a lurker. For this, I will be that impactful support player that they need.
When playing against Liquid in the past was there anything that stuck out as particularly good or bad?
The main things that have really got my attention is the team work and the potential that this team has.
Who at Liquid are you most looking forward to working/playing with?
Everyone but especially Nitro and Elige. Nitro is basically a father to me and EliGE is definitely the best player in NA.
Is there a part of your game you want to improve on with Liquid? Are there questions you're looking to ask Stanislaw or Zews?
With the help of these two amazing masterminds, I will mostly be looking to learn and develop better knowledge and skills within the game.
We've got a busy schedule in the next few weeks, are you ready to jump in?!
Definitely.
Any closing words for all the Liquid and new Twistzz fans out there?
Hope my fans are as happy as I am to see me playing under the Liquid banner. Thank you to everyone who supported me and thank you to Liquid for giving me this opportunity. I hope the Liquid fans will support me.
A big special thanks to my amazing girlfriend. They have been supporting me since the start of my career, they help me with stress and really helps me recover after a loss. I love them lots.
Oh and how are your falling AWP skills? We want to do well at the next major....
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Today we are happy to announce that we have acquired Russel "Twistzz" VanDulken. As most of you know, Twistzz was on loan from Misfits this week in EPL where we defeated Optic 2-0 and tied with SK 1-1. We are super excited to have this young star on our roster and we'll now let Twistzz introduce himself!
How to submit a Proposal to the DAO
Hi, I'm Colm and I work for Slock.it as a security expert, analysing and testing Smart Contracts. I am tasked with helping the community review the contracts that request addition to the white list of The DAO.
Since my last post about bytecode verification, The DAO has become very successful, therefore making it an obvious target. We must remain vigilant, as attackers are surely going to try and scam our beloved DAO. The first line of defense against attacks is… you guessed it, the whitelist.
The DAO cannot send ETH to an address that is not on the whitelist. The function of the Curator is to manage this list. It's important to note that Curators aren't here to gauge the ethical or financial merits of a Proposal, but only to ensure that the Proposal smart contract will operate as described, and is safe to be included on the whitelist.
Hundreds of people are going to want to join the white list so they can make proposals. We as a community need to streamline the addition process to find attacks and verify the bytecode of these addresses.
The DAO's security is paramount to its success
I am of the opinion that it would be prudent for the Curators, at least during the first couple of months, to not allow Proposals on that whitelist that do not conform to the following guidelines:
Simple wallet or account addresses should be prohibited, addresses should be contracts. Proposal Contracts should only accept payment from the DAO once, and exclusively for a fixed amount. Proposal Contracts should allow for the return of all remaining ETH to the DAO upon request. In other words, the DAO should be able to fire the Contractor and collect the funds that have yet to be spent in the smart contract.
How to Submit your Proposal to The DAO
Step 1. Write your smart contract.
Please refer to this example of a sample Proposal matching the requirements above. This code has been tested and retested to ensure it is safe to be submitted to The DAO. Once you have defined all of your variables, deploy it.
Step 2: Post on DAOhub.org
Once you are confident your contract matches all of the above requirements, create a post on the DAOHub forums here. In your post, please include the address of the deployed contract, a link to its source code, compilation instructions and the date, time and link of the Google hangout (preferred method) you will use to confirm your identity. A link to the details of your proposal should also be included.
You may be wondering why the link to the Google hangout. It's important for Contractors that submit proposals to verify their identify — we wouldn't want someone to falsely claim to be IBM or Andreas Antonopoulos for example. To prevent this, each person who holds a private key to the multisig of the Contract should join a Google Hangout to read their address aloud. This will then be made into a YouTube video automatically.
Pictures won't suffice: It is relatively easy to photoshop pictures. But it's very difficult to doctor videos especially live video where a person interacts in real time with external parties. As part of these interactions, you may be asked to sign a message to show that you do control this address.
Step 3: The Community Weighs in
Your forum post is public for the general community to verify that the byte code matches the source code and analyze your contract. Ultimately however, the final decision lays in the hands of the Curators.
The community will then verify your contract, which includes insuring the bytecode matches its source, and confirming that it will not allow for any attacks against the DAO. It's a party and everyone is invited! If you want to be part of all this fun join us on DAOHub forums here, or join the DAO Slack chat (signup) with the community.
Step 4: The Curators receive a report
This community will prepare a monthly report of the findings summarizing all the Proposals. This report will be published on the 7th of each month (on DAOhub.org). In order to allow time for community review we would ask that your Proposal submissions on the DAOHub forums with plenty of time before the deadline, to allow for a proper community review and response. Also please note that more complex contracts will take more time.
Of course, we shouldn't let security hinder innovation, and these high-level guidelines will evolve overtime. Good luck with your Proposals!
If you want to be part of the community verification, just join the DAOHub forums here, or join the DAO Slack chat (signup) with the community. Happy hunting, verifiers! Stay Vigilant.
Concern about a lack of diversity dominated the Oscars this year. Pride about an unusually diverse theater season permeated the Tonys in June.
Now the issue has entangled an embryonic attempt by DreamWorks to adapt a popular animated film from 1998, “The Prince of Egypt,” into a stage musical.
The issue erupted on social media over the weekend, after a nonprofit on Long Island, the Bay Street Theater, announced plans to hold a free concert performance of the developing show next month in a park in Sag Harbor, N.Y. The event will be the first time the full script and score have been heard by the public.
The problem is this: Although the show, about the life of Moses as described in Exodus, is set in ancient Egypt, the bulk of the cast is white, and initial publicity about the event last week led to the mistaken impression by some that the entire cast was white. (According to Bay Street, a third of the Equity cast for the one-night reading, including two of the six principals, are actors of color.)
Like the Survation poll in the Mail on Sunday, YouGov in the Sunday Times show Remain ahead again following the pro-Leave polls a week ago. Topline figures are REMAIN 44%, LEAVE 43%, with fieldwork conducted on Thursday and Friday (full tabs are here). Almost inevitably people are going to look at these polls and assume that the murder of Jo Cox on Thursday has caused the move back towards remain.
My own view is that Jo Cox's death probably isn't the cause of the reverse. YouGov also conducted a poll on Wednesday-Thursday for ITV, and that already showed Leave's lead falling (and indeed, a third of the fieldwork for this poll was conducted before Jo Cox's death was announced). Looking at the rest of the questions, there is also a marked shift in people's views on how they think leaving the EU would impact their finances – 33% of people now think that they would be worse off outside the EU, compared to 23% a fortnight ago.
The historic trend in referendums is for people to move towards the status quo. In Scotland a couple of years ago a couple of polls a fortnight out were neck-and-neck, but moved back to a clear NO lead by the final polls (and there was a further swing on the day itself). In the EU referendum polls have consistently shown that people think leave is the riskier choice and that people think it will damage the economy. While it was never inevitable, this has always suggested that late movement towards Remain was quite likely. If people are increasingly worried about Brexit's impact on their own personal finances, then even more so.
Of course, we will never know for sure. The reality is that we can see changes in headline voting intention in polls, but we can never be certain what causes them: all we can do is look at what events happened at the same time and at what changes there have been in other questions in the poll that might have driven a shift. What we do know is that, whatever the reason, we've got four new polls tonight – some before Jo Cox's death, some after – with three of them showing a shift back towards Remain.
During the month of Ramadan, a state owned fuel company in Jakarta, Indonesia is offering two liters of free petrol per chapter read to motorcyclists. There are prayer rooms set up in the gas stations to accommodate this endeavor. The program organizers say the goal is to promote Islam in society.
On one hand, many may come across this news and think “free gas!” On the other hand, others may see this as subtle Islamic propaganda in society. This is an incentive to be more committed to Islam and it normalizes Islamic religiosity.
While that does not seem so bad, I can't help but consider the positions of the minorities in these societies. Imagine being a non-Muslim, Queer identified (Muslim or not), or an ex-Muslim in these environments where Islam is so socially ingrained. It can be quite suffocating.
And if you're in a society where following Islam is encouraged and you are given economic incentive for it (like free fuel); the stigma of being an ex-Muslim, one who stands against society's directions, can be suffocating.
Just my thought process.

Campfire Union is announcing a new Gear VR title today based off of the popular Reiner Knizia board game Lost Cities. The Lost Cities VR Experience incorporates the classic rules and gameplay of the tabletop adventure into an immersive, multiplayer video game.
Based on the award-winning tabletop game Lost Cities by world-renowned board game designer Reiner Knizia, Lost Cities Virtual Reality Edition is a card game that takes place in unexplored regions and mythical realms in search of Lost Cities. The Goal Of this two player strategy game is to make the most profit and outwit your opponent. Can you lead the most profitable expedition?
Lost Cities Virtual Reality Edition allows you to either play against AI foes in various archaeological environments, or test your skills online against opponents from around the world. The online mode also provides full voice chat and head tracked avatars just like Oculus Trivia or other Oculus Social applications.
The essential gameplay of Lost Cities revolves around placing color coded numbered tiles onto one of the five game sections with the corresponding color. When you place your first number on one of these sections you subtract 20 points from your overall score – this is the cost of beginning your “expedition.”
You then attempt to turn that debt into profit by placing more and more numbered tiles onto that same color coded section. You can only place tiles in chronological order which forces some tough decisions about whether you should play that six right now, or wait and see if a four or a five will make its way into your hand.
10 is the highest tile possible. Once the 10 tile of any color is played, that expedition is considered over and you had better hope you played enough other tiles to either break even or turn a profit on that initial 20 point investment. There is also a wager system and a discard mechanic for even more strategic play.
This all may sound complicated, and there is a bit of a learning curve to the game, but – like all board games – you'll pick up the mechanics and strategy as you play.
Reiner Knizia is a German-born legend for the board games industry. They used to work for a huge international bank, but they gave that up and has now published over 600 board games of nearly every size and genre.
Some of their most well known titles are: Lord of The Rings, Pickomino, Keltis, and Ingengious.
Knizia employs an abstract style of game design in their projects. This means that their games do not attempt to directly recreate their theme through very clear real-world mechanics.
For example, in Risk you are attacking other countries and gathering armies in a way that does its best to emulate real world combat with board game elements. Lost Cities, however, uses mathematical gameplay to force the strategy of risk management and the thrill of achieving a profit upon the player, but in a much more abstract way.
Lost Cities Virtual Reality Edition is available for download today through the Oculus app on your Android smartphone and is compatible with the Samsung Gear VR headset.

SAN FRANCISCO -- The way IT security pros see it, Adobe is the monster they can't live with anymore. But they really can't live without it, either.
Users rely on Adobe software to create, edit and view a variety of rich media content. But for many security practitioners, frequent attacks against a range of security holes has become too much to take. In early February -- mere weeks after the company patched one critical flaw -- Adobe was forced to rush out another patch for its Reader and Acrobat software. The company also had to rush out a critical fix for Flash Player in February. At the start of the year, some security vendors openly predicted that Adobe would be the top target of attackers in 2010.
The company's security team has not taken the heat lying down. It has tried to use the blogosphere to stay in touch with customers regarding new flaws, attacks and fixes and has taken steps to improve the patch-installation process.
But for now at least, that's of little comfort to security pros like Christophe Veltsos, president of Prudent Security and keeper of the DrInfoSec.com site.
"I used to require that my students (at Minn. State U. Mankato) turn in their assignments in PDF format instead of Microsoft Word," they said, adding that in light of recent security problems, "I've switched back to Microsoft Word as it appears to be a safer alternative than PDF."
Not helping Adobe's image is that Steve Jobs has been slamming Adobe Flash, explaining to the press that it has no place in such Apple devices as the newly-unveiled iPad. Specifically, they called it a CPU hog and a magnet for security holes.
At this week's RSA security conference, Brad Arkin, director of product security and privacy at Adobe Systems, will spend a lot of time with Adobe customers, explaining what the company is doing to improve security. They sat down with CSOonline.com a couple days before the start of RSA to offer a preview of what he'll discuss.
CSO: Adobe has had to confront a lot of security holes of late, and a lot of security practitioners have been expressing concern. What will you be doing at RSA to calm their fears?
Brad Arkin: We don't have any product announcements to make at RSA, but we'll be having a lot of meetings with customers and people from the media. Adobe is a member of the Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (SAFECode) and I'm on the board, and we'll be having a meeting Monday. I'll also be speaking to groups and individuals at the various networking parties during the week. I'll be giving a lot of short talks to promote the security message we've been promoting for the past year. The biggest thing we're trying to achieve is transparency.
It seems like Adobe is taking the same level of heat Microsoft used to take in the days of Internet Explorer 6 and Windows 2000 and XP. How do you respond when people criticize Adobe for the flaws and attacks?
Arkin: The point we try to make is that the threat landscape is evolving quite rapidly and we're doing everything possible to react to that and stay ahead of what's happening. We understand that the reason Adobe is such a big target for the bad guys is that it's so ubiquitous. Something like Reader or Flash player is installed on just about every single machine out there that's connected to the Internet. That means the bad guys don't have to work so hard because if they can find a problem to exploit it can be directed at every machine. As a result, every bad guy on Earth is looking for something to exploit in our software. One thing we can do to make our products less attractive to the bad guys is to regularly update and make sure as many people as possible are using the most updated versions -- and make it as easy as possible for them to do so.
How are you making it so?
Arkin: For the consumer, we have a new updater for Reader and Acrobat that's in pilot-beta phase. We've gotten a lot of positive feedback from testers so far. It'll offer a fully automatic, silent installation experience for updates. Today we have what we call semi-automatic mode, where it'll check for updates and download it, then put up a box that tells the user there's an update and asks if they want to install it now. The reason people will sometimes say no is because at that moment they're in the middle of doing something and think the update will require them to reboot their machine. It doesn't require a reboot but they think it will. This new automatic mode will check for and download updates and then install it without asking the user any questions. Then a box will pop up informing the user that an update is available and will take effect next time they boot up their machine.
Another tool we have for Adobe Acrobat and Reader is something called the JavaScript Blacklist Framework, which we pushed out in October. It provides customers with granular control over the execution of specific JavaScript API calls, providing protection against attacks that go after those specific JavaScript API calls. This has been extremely helpful in helping customers mitigate attacks, even if a patch is not yet available.
You're going to be on a panel at RSA that'll tackle the pros and cons of vulnerability disclosure. What's your personal position on this?
Arkin: There are different levels of disclosure. Full disclosure is when someone publically published a vulnerability along with all the details needed to carry out the attack. Partial disclosure is when someone says they found a new kind of attack but they don't go into all the details. Responsible disclosure is when a researcher finds a problem, shares all the details with the vendor and no one else. In 2009 there were three bugs that were fully disclosed. It's a bummer because the bad guys can use the detail to craft malicious exploits and doesn't give us time to get mitigation down to the users.
Our preference is always that researchers will share their findings with us and no one else. That way we can get a fix out before the bad guys can exploit it.
Scott Blumstein, a Temple University graduate and Philadelphia resident, holds up the bracelet after winning the World Series of Poker main event, Sunday, July 23, 2017, in Las Vegas.
A recent Temple University graduate took their place atop the poker world early Sunday by winning the world's biggest poker tournament — and hauling in $8 million.
Scott Blumstein, a native of northern New Jersey who lives outside Atlantic City, took down the last two competitors at the final table of the 2017 World Series of Poker main event in Las Vegas. They held a commanding lead going into the final night of play that started Saturday evening, and was one of more than 7,000 that started the tournament.
The 25-year-old, who was described by Poker News as "an East Coast tournament grinder," entered the night with a commanding lead. A grinder is a player who spends a lot of time at the poker table and who considers poker a career.
The win "changes my life," they told ESPN, which broadcast the event.
"I'm really happy with how I played tonight," Blumstein said. "Really happy with the result, really happy with the deuce, because I was playing good, but I'm pretty tired of poker at this point, honestly. To have to go back and battle pretty deep-[stacked] again, I wasn't looking forward to it."
Entering Saturday, Blumstein had 226 million chips, compared to the second-place chip-holder Dan Ott's 88 million and Benjamin Pollack's 45 million.
Ott is also a Pennsylvanian who hails from Altoona. Pollack is a French poker professional.
Despite the win, Blumstein isn't getting overly confident just yet.
"If you had to ask me, probably the two guys I would the least want to get three-handed with," Blumstein told ESPN. "But with that being said, I have a lot of chips and I'm confident we're going to go home, work on some three-handed poker, and come back ready to play tomorrow."
Blumstein graduated from Temple three years ago with a degree in accounting. According to their Twitter account, he's a "professional liver."
He'll likely be a professional poker player for the considerable future.
The $8.15 million isn't be their first big score in a poker tournament. They won nearly $200,000 in a tournament at the Borgata in Atlantic City last year.
In the wake of a deadly explosion on the St. Petersburg metro, you could bet on conspirators of all kinds to come up with their own versions of events immediately after the tragic news broke. This time around, US liberal media darling and News Corp. executive Louise Mensch took the prize for wildest conspiracy theory -- and not just one.
Almost immediately after the news of the St. Petersburg explosion reached the US, one of the most vocal critics of Donald Trump, ex-US intelligence operative Jon Schindler, offered a hot take in their new role as political expert.
— John Schindler (@20committee) April 3, 2017
It didn't take long for former UK parliamentarian and current News Corp Vice President, Louise Mensch, to seize on Schindler's words to advance their explosive allegations.
— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) April 3, 2017
Mensch followed up Schindler's tweet with a really juicy scoop: Russian President Vladimir Putin killed Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin. It's hard to argue with them evidence. Actually, it is impossible. They have no evidence.
Asked to back up their claim — quite literally the first thing a journalist would expect someone to ask them to do — Mensch said their theory was “the bleeding obvious.”
A correspondent from Radio Free Europe summed the situation up rather succinctly:
— Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) April 3, 2017
​This is not the first time Mensch has come out with an insane conspiracy theory. They became a laughing stock in Britain after claiming that Putin killed journalist Andrew Breitbart in order to advance Steve Bannon's career. Mensch also claims to have superpowers, allowing them to see things other people are incapable of noticing. The BBC's Andrew Neil couldn't resist asking them about some of the wild statements she's made — and the interview became an internet-sensation.
Among other choice Mensch accusations: Investigative site ProPublica is in cahoots with Bannon and its journalists are "Russian shills."
— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 29, 2017
Russia is secretly operating public wi-fi networks in their neighborhood.
— Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) March 3, 2017
​Russia paid the Swedes to riot, and Putin killed Russia's ambassador to Turkey.
The list goes on.
Despite obvious concerns regarding their mental health, Mensch remains a senior executive at News Corp., owned by Rupert Murdoch. She's also recently become a much sought-after guest on liberal talk shows, such as Real Time with Bill Maher.
On the eve of Senate hearings on alleged Russian meddling into the US presidential election, the New York Times even published an op-ed they penned, titled, “What to Ask About Russian Hacking.” But the fact that the Grey Lady invited a discredited conspiracy theorist as its guest columnist didn't sit well with paper's staff — especially as Mensch mentioned in the op-ed their report, discredited previously by Times' journalists themselves. Reporter Charlie Savage even took to Twitter to publicly state their position: “Please note that NYT newsroom disagrees.”
— Charlie Savage (@charlie_savage) March 19, 2017
None of this has stopped Democratic operatives from singing the praises of Mensch and their wild stories. Disgraced DNC chairperson Donna Brazile, who was ousted after being exposed to be rigging the Democratic primary against Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton, even went as far as thanking Mensch for “good journalism.”
— Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) March 18, 2017
​Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising, as Brazile was also fired from CNN for leaking presidential debate questions to Clinton and lying about it — their definition of “good journalism” is questionable at best. But the fact that someone with such a troubling history of reporting as Mensch's becomes a “truth-teller” in the eyes of mainstream media establishment clearly explains why a majority of Americans across the political spectrum do not to regularly provide trustworthy news.
Update: The most recent polls from Monmouth University show 20 percent of Americans believe online news sites don't publish fake news, while 40 percent said cable TV and newspapers are trustworthy.

Last night saw the awards ceremony for the Australia's best ciders at the 2015 Cider Australia Awards. Last year, somewhat controversially, the top gong went to the British cider maker Thatchers with their Somerset Gold. This year the top award stayed local. Willie Smith's 18 Varieties limited edition taking out the Best in Show award. Results After the break.
Judges said the “18 Varieties” was very true to type – a medium cider in the traditional style – describing it as “lifted … with a lingering fruit flavour and an attractive bitterness on finish”.
Willie Smith's co-owner Sam Reid said the prestigious award was a great reward for the entire crew at the Grove business, which is based on a fourth-generation organic apple farm.
“We couldn't be happier with this product because it showcases what is great about Willie Smith's – we are small enough to make really interesting cider but large enough to get it out to enough people to educate and influence the category.” – Sam Reid
Willie Smith's 18 Varieties won 3 trophies – Best in Show, Best Cider and Best Australian Cider or Perry.
Cider Australia Vice President Warwick Billings said judges were impressed with the standard on display as they worked their way through 155 entries across 18 classes.
“This year there were almost double the number of medals awarded resulting from a significant increase in bronzes, which indicates that Australian producers are refining their cider making skills,” – Mr Billings.

The proposed Baseline Road busway took a step forward Wednesday as the city's transportation committee approved a plan to build the $148-million cross-town line to carry 10,000 riders a day.
The 14-kilometre Richmond-Baseline-Heron corridor bypasses downtown, connecting OC Transpo riders to existing and planned Transitway and O-Train networks. There will be 24 new stations, each located about 575 metres apart (Transitway stations are between 800 metres to one kilometre apart). The plan also includes kilometres of new sidewalks and cycle tracks.
Buses will use designated median lanes, which the city says will shave travel time and increase reliability because they won't get stuck in congestion.
“That's effectively what makes it rapid,” said Keith Egli, transportation committee chairperson.
Some residents raised concerns about having to walk further to reach a bus stop, navigating ice- and snow-covered sidewalks and platforms in winter, and crossing several lanes of traffic to board the bus in the median, instead of catching it at the curb.
Egli says the city has listened to those concerns and will respond by enhancing snow removal on the sidewalks and road, adding benches along the corridor, and installing a new signalized intersection at St. Helen's Place.
The city is still seeking commitments from the federal and provincial governments to pay for the first stretch, from Baseline to Heron stations, which will cost an estimated $140 million. Transit priority measures between Baseline and Bayshore will add another $8 million to the tab.

The actual rapid transit line between Baseline and Bayshore, to be built sometime after 2031, is estimated to cost a further $140 million.
Egli says he's not worried efforts to secure funding for this project will get in the way of the city's plans for building the second phase of LRT. “There hasn't been any, ‘If you want this, you have to trade off that,'” they said.
Existing OC Transpo service along the corridor is primarily provided by Route 118. Route 111 also travels along the corridor east of Prince of Wales, while eight other routes use it for short stretches. Buses operate primarily in mixed traffic, where they are often delayed by congestion.
John Manconi, general manager of transportation services, says it's too early to know what service will look like once the busway is finished. Integration into the current bus network will be part of the detailed design phase.
“The key point is you're going to get through that corridor much quicker than in the past,” they said.
The city says 15 private properties will be expropriated, while more than 200 others could be affected. Strips of land are also required from 10 properties owned by the federal government, including the Central Experimental Farm.
If everything falls into place, construction could begin by 2020 and buses would start rolling down the new lanes in 2022.
Council will vote on the plan next week.
The transportation committee also agreed to find an alternate route for the Blackburn Hamlet Bypass and Cumberland Transitway after a report found the existing approved corridor would prove too costly because of unsuitable ground conditions.

Now more than any other animated film in history, “Frozen” has resonated with global audiences like a cosmic tuning fork, lightening parents' wallets as of this past weekend by over $1.072 billion.
The Disney picture just surpassed the box-office intake of “Toy Story 3” ($1.063 billion) and has cracked the top 10 worldwide highest-grossing movies of all time.
The film's astonishing success has come as a surprise to most, but on closer examination, we can discern at least five standout ingredients to Frozen's alchemy. Although the movie is a four-quadrant success (it appeals to males and females over and under 25 years old), the same can be said for most Pixar and Disney studio films. Where Frozen really works its magic is with Generation Z, called The Pluralist Generation by research firm Frank N. Magid Associates. These are the young-uns born between the late ‘90s and mid-‘00s.
Naturally, Disney is moving quickly to leverage this unprecedented success. A Broadway musical, theme park attractions, video games, and feature film sequels are all in the offing. But if any of these are truly going to reach the heights of the original—and if other studios are intent on trading in on the movie's amazing success—producers would all do well to carefully consider why audiences keep returning for more “Frozen.”
Warning: Spoilers follow.
1. Disney lured in boys with a little white lie
Early teasers and trailers for “Frozen” didn't feature princesses in tiaras, instead opting for boyish hijinks between snowman Olaf and reindeer Sven, as well as an emphasis on the film's action sequences. It was an interesting gamble, but not without precedent.
Disney pulled the same sleight of hand with “Tangled” in 2010, effectively packing theaters with testosterone-fueled half-pints, who then were subjected to a picture about a very longhaired princess. That still leaves the question, why are even boys coming back for seconds and thirds with “Frozen”?
2. Real Darkness but no real evil villain
With values and ethics in flux around the world, kids are growing up in a world colored by shades of gray. Gen X'ers and adult Millennials are teaching their Gen-Z progeny that it isn't about Good Vs. Evil, it's about trying to figure out why they're yelling at you.
“Frozen” cleverly taps into this on many levels, most of which are easily identifiable to kids. A bad accident and injury between siblings provides the film's inciting incident. Helicopter parents make poor decisions, and then are killed (off-screen) in an accident themselves. Most pointedly Hans, ostensibly the film's central villain, lures hero Anna into a false relationship in order to gain the throne.
However, as excellently described in TrilbeeReviews, Hans is actually a pretty good leader, and handles a myriad of situations rather heroically. Yes, they are following a selfish and deceitful agenda, but that makes them a crappy boyfriend, not diabolical.
3. Dispenses with sexist love tropes once and for all
On a recent edition of the Pop Culture Happy Hour podcast, NPR's Linda Holmes observed that Disney feature animation has spent the past decade or so making up for the hoary sexism of the previous 40 years. By refuting the notion of love at first sight, and by subverting the salvation heros can receive by love's first (male) kiss, “Frozen” drops the cherry on the sundae.
There is a new realism, according to Magid, a toning down of the American Dream being passed down to kids by young parents. “Your Prince is not coming, so don't wait for him!” they seem to be saying. “Frozen” provides us with positive reinforcement of these notions blithely, delightfully, and without Shrek-like cynicism.
In fact, gender roles are either blurred or tossed altogether, and that's pretty much how huge swathes of the Pluralist generation sees things. In the film, true love's kiss comes not from a strong, handsome man, but from the love of a sister.
4. New discoveries on repeated viewings.
Some critics have read “Frozen”'s structure as overly simplistic, almost vacuous, but kids seem to be singing a different tune after returning to theaters based on Starlight Runner's tracking. On a second viewing, they're realizing the dippy Hans/Anna romance in the first half-hour is going to be subverted, and that the love tropes of the songs are really being made fun of.
They are also realizing Elsa's awesome power has a negative impact on the people they love, even though she's gone away. Sure, these are subtle nuances, but we are apparently raising a generation of savvier and more sensitive kids. On top of that, they're really digging the songs.
5. “Let It Go.”
Within a couple of weeks of the film's release, Disney dealt a masterstroke by posting the entire “Let It Go” music sequence online. The finest animated number in decades, it started flooding Facebook, and generating covers on YouTube by the thousand. If we listen to the song itself, it's fine, a kind of Broadway anthem. Demi Lovato's version peaked at 38on the Billboard Hot 100. But the combination of song and visual is another thing altogether.
Gen-Z kids, starved for a female superhero lead that Marvel and DC Comics have refused to provide on the big screen so far, finally get one with Elsa. Two super heroic things are happening in the sequence at the same time: First, a girl is wielding power, the likes of which we've never seen before, and their actions are conveyed with a true visual splendor.
The second, equally important, is Elsa's transformation from uptight teen to the majestic Snow Queen. It seems the one thing we still can't seem to resist—even all the little Plurals—is a makeover.

Spot Cool Stuff adores glamping travel. Glamorous camping can get you out into a natural environment in the same way tent camping does. But it combines that with touches of luxury like you might find at a high-end hotel. After spending much of our youth backpacking on a rock-bottom budget, we think we've earned a bit of luxury.
Much of what we write about glamping on this travel blog concerns resorts that combine aspects of roughing it with aspects of being pampered. (Our review of these 5 especially wondering glamping spots is a good place to start reading about those). We also appreciate products that let travelers create their own glamping experience. Our favorite of those might be this:
The Dutchtub.
It's like a personal hot-springs-to-go. If you have a tub-sized patch of flat ground, wood and 200 gallons (750 liters) worth of water or snow you can have your own spa virtually anywhere.
Here's how it works:
Fill your tub with water via a suction hose, bucket brigade or whatever other means you can. (Alternatively, you can leave the Dutchtub outside and let snow or rain do the job for you).
Next, attach the included convection unit to the side of the Dutchtub and build a three-to-four log fire within its coil. Then cover your tub and wait for the water within to get toasty warm. The length of your wait will depend on the type of wood used and the starting temperatures. If the water and air temperature are each a few degrees above freezing, for instance, plan on about two hours for the tub water to heat to 100°F (38°C).
Finally, treat the water with soap, hydrogen peroxide, swimming pool shock or — preferably and most pleasantly — natural salts. Hop in and enjoy! (And try not to think about how it looks like you are sitting in an oversized cappuccino mug).
The regular Dutchtub is large enough to fit four adults comfortably; the slope of the tub's side naturally forms ergonomic “seats.” There's also a Dutchtub Loveseat (pics below) that fits two adults facing each other.
Both Dutchtub models are made from the same stainless steel used to construct giant wind turbines. Durability isn't an issue. Portability might be. Everything needed to set up the tub, including the convention coil and the lid, weighs 165 pounds (75 kg) — light enough for two adults to pick it up but too heavy for them to move it very far. Fortunately, the tub does have an optional wheeled hand trailer and is small enough to be tied to the top of a large car (and to make said car look ridiculous).
The cost of the Dutchtub is no small issue either: €5,200 for the regular Dutchtub or €3,300 for the Dutchtub Loveseat. For a much cheaper and more easily movable alternative consider the Swim Time Portable Inflatable Spa. It isn't nearly as cool-looking and is powered by electricity rather than wood. But it also costs only $544 with the current Amazon discount.
If you do spring for a Dutchtub, the price might stress you out initially. But after few minutes soaking in its warm waters on some secluded beach, we suspect you'll quickly forget how much it cost.

Jackie Chan once again proved their box office mettle in China, while new releases took the top seven box office places over the important Chinese New Year period.
“Dragon Blade,” in which Chan stars with Adrien Brody and John Cusack, and which was produced by Chan's Sparkle Roll Media company, emerged on top with a beefy $54.8 million in four days (Thursday to Sunday, Feb. 19-22).
That was 26% of the $210 million combined top 10 box office over the week of Feb. 16-22.
The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said in a statement that total box office reached $282 million (RMB1.73 billion) in the five day Feb. 19-24 period. That compares with $231 million (RMB1.39 billion) last year.
Like its rivals, “Dragon Blade” chose to release on the first day of this year's Chinese New Year holiday. Distributors include Easter Mordor and Huayi Bros. Financial backers for the reportedly $65 million production include Alibaba Pictures Group and its Yulebao fan funding operation.
It beat “The Man From Macau II,” a sequel to last year's hit Chow Yun-fat-starring Hong Kong-style gambling comedy “The Man From Macau” (aka “From Vegas to Macau”), directed by Wong Jing. Distributed by Bona Film Group, the picture earned $43.1 million in four days.

In third place was 3D fantasy “Zhong Kui: Snow Girl and the Dark Crystal,” produced on a budget of some $30 million. The film was co-directed by “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's” Oscar-winning cinematographer Peter Pau and Zhao Tianyu and earned $31.2 million. Distributors include Enlight Pictures and state-owned Huaxia Distribution.
In fourth was Jean-Jacques Annaud's “Wolf Totem,” a $38 million Franco-Chinese adaptation of a bestselling novel that mixes up wildlife and painful modern history of the Cultural Revolution. Distributed and financed by China Film Group, and also presented in 3D, it managed a tepid $24.8 million in its four days of official release. But including previews, its cume stands at a more acceptable $32.3 million.
“Where Are We Going Dad 2,” a sequel to last year's surprise hit “Where Are We Going Dad,” earned $20.7 million and fifth place for distributor LeVision Pictures. The bigscreen adaptation of a TV reality show that sees celebrity parents doing silly things with their kids is scorned by some as barely a movie, but it proved solid family entertainment for the holiday period.
Seventh place belonged to “Emperor's Holiday's,” a more creative adaptation of the same “Where Are We Going, Dad” TV series. It earned $8.95 million for Tianjin Bona and Huaxia.
Splitting the pair and taking sixth place was “Triumph in the Skies,” a movie version of a popular Hong Kong TV series about couples in the airline business. It earned $12.7 million in four days for distributors Media Asia and Enlight.
In eighth was the previous week's top film, romance “Somewhere Only We Know,” which earned $6.31 million over the holidays. It did well to jump the holiday crush and has a cume that now stands at $44.3 million after 13 days.
Likewise “Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part I” earned a modest $4.03 million on the week, but has a cume of $36.0 million after 15 days.
Bringing up 10th place was “Boonie Bears: Mystical Winter,” which squeezed out $3.82 million, for a cumulative score of $44 million after 25 days.
The top films will likely continue to cannibalize each other over the next week, though word of mouth will help some more than others and a reordering of the chart seems likely – “Wolf Totem” and “Dragon Blade” currently get the highest viewer ratings on popular movie website Douban.
They will also be joined by competition from Hollywood in the animated form of “Big Hero 6,” which releases on Saturday, Feb. 28. Other Hollywood releases coming up include another family-friendly title, “Paddington,” on March 5. The Wachowski siblings' “Jupiter Ascending,” which flopped badly in North America, may find some solace from Chinese audiences, who are warm to big vfx movies. It releases on March 6.
"Traces of an explosion" were found on the left wing of the Polish presidential plane that crashed and killed all 96 people on board in Smolensk, western Russia, in 2010, a special new commission investigating the crash has said.

An earlier report into the crash under Poland's previous government said the wing smashed into a birch tree close to the runway at the Smolensk military airport, causing the plane to crash.
“Damage to the left wing of the TU 154M was not started by colliding with the birch tree … The wing's destruction started before the birch tree… [and] much damage to the left wing of the TU 154M plane carry traces of an explosion,” the commission said in a statement on Wednesday.
The 2010 crash killed Polish President Lech Kaczyński, their wife, and 94 others, many of them top government and military officials.
The new commission set up by the conservative Law and Justice party, headed by the late president's twin brother, after it came to power in 2015, claimed earlier this year that the presidential plane was probably brought down by an explosion.
It added that Russian air traffic controllers deliberately misled Polish pilots about their location as they approached the runway of the Smolensk military airport in western Russia on 10 April 2010. (vb/pk)

The PH-1, better known as the Essential Phone, was arguably one of the most hyped new phones in years. Created by Essential, a reportedly billion-dollar company led by Android cofounder Andy Rubin, the device was anticipated all summer. But when it was finally released in August, it got mixed reviews. Reviewers say the camera is lackluster, it doesn't have a headphone jack, and it isn't water-resistant. Now, iFixit has shown that the Essential Phone is also a nightmare to repair.
In a teardown posted Tuesday, iFixit's team shows how hard it is to remove the Essential Phone's glass display. In order to get the job done, iFixit had to freeze it using Super Cold Spray, an aerosol spray designed to cool electronics down to -60 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Normally when dealing with an unknown/stubborn adhesive, we'll either try a solvent, or heat it to soften it and make it easier to separate," a spokesperson from iFixit told me in an email. "In the case of the Essential Phone, we had zero success with heat and we couldn't open up a gap large enough to try any solvent. But getting it very cold makes the adhesive brittle and causes the materials to contract a bit, which makes it easier to break up. We didn't have to freeze the whole phone, but we did have to ice the surface down with a spray refrigerant to make any headway on the adhesive."
One additional problem is that the phone's USB-C port is soldered directly to the motherboard. That means if it breaks—a common problem in other phones—you'll need to shell out for a pricy micro-soldering job or replace the whole motherboard (which could cost even more). "We are disappointed," the iFixit team wrote.
The teardown isn't all bad: iFixit gave the Essential Phone points for being modular (right now the only official accessory available is a 360-degree camera). "Modular smartphone systems have yet to to take off, but it's an idea we can appreciate—the environmental toll of clipping on a hot new camera module is a lot lower than upgrading your whole phone," iFixit said in the teardown.
The PH-1 also got points for having a battery attached with stretch-release adhesive—which is the most friendly for repairs. iPhone batteries are also attached using this type of adhesive. But the battery is really difficult to access—so it's still pretty hard to replace.
Lastly, the Essential Phone earned some repair credibility by having standard screws. To the extent that they're used, all of the screws are Phillips/JIS fasteners. That's a big plus compared to the iPhone, which requires a special pentalobe screwdriver to open.
Overall, the Essential Phone earned a dismal 1 out of 10 on the iFixit repairability scale. The iPhone 7 Plus, for comparison, received a 7 out of 10. Essential did not return a request for comment in time for publication.
"Nearly invisible seams and copious amounts of adhesive means any attempt at repair is likely to inflict as much damage as it fixes," the iFixit team wrote.
Top takeaways from DevOps Enterprise Summit 2015: No longer on the fringes of IT
They came, 1,200 of them, to the City by the Bay to bathe in the sea of DevOps, whose miracle waters are said to be able to transform into nimble software producers even the most rigid of IT departments.
They came to tell and to hear fantastic stories about how, after adopting DevOps, development and operations team stransmogrify from Hatfields and McCoys into bands of brothers. Then there is no more finger pointing. No more distrust. No more misunderstandings. Just one team, pursuing common goals, for the good of the business.
They came, representing about 500 companies, to give and listen to testimonials about slow, clunky, error-filled software development and delivery processes that, thanks to DevOps, metamorphose, and code begins flowing off the pipeline swiftly, bug-free and continuously.
Yes, for three days, the sold-out DevOps Enterprise Summit, held at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco and live-streamed to the world, brought together a fervent group of believers in this novel and controversial approach to software creation and deployment.
Here, for the faithful and the skeptical, are some key takeaways from the conference.
How to Build a DevOps Toolchain That Scales GET WHITE PAPER
The DevOps community isn't quite a cult, but it's very tight
In interviews, tweets and blog posts, an oft-repeated observation was that there is a strong emotional bond among those who are spearheading DevOps adoption in their respective IT organizations. "What did I get most value out of you wonder? One hundred percent the discussions with people in the hallway, with fellow speakers, with all the people who are on the journey with me," wrote Mirco Hering, one of the conference's speakers, in a blog post. "Looking forward to making the next steps together and share our stories again next year," wrote Hering, a Senior Manager at Accenture whole leads DevOps and Agile in the Asia-Pacific region.
Meanwhile, technology consultant and analyst Brian Gracely described the atmosphere as pragmatic, with a focus on how to make real business changes that have a real financial impact, and the interactions among attendees as genuine, touching not just on successes. "DOES is a community event. Sharing is extensive, and not just the rock-star kind of sharing. Speakers talk about failures and bad decision and incorrect assumptions," Gracely, an attendee, wrote. "Attendees sympathize with their colleagues, because just like the unicorns, there is not a handbook for transforming a dinosaur into a cheetah."
Nicole Forsgren, Ph.D, director of organizational performance and analytics at Chef, which makes software to automate infrastructure management, concurs. "We want to help each other do amazing things, and we do," Forsgren said in an interview with TechBeacon.
[ Webinar: Agile Portfolio Management: Three best practices ]
DevOps is good for IT and for the business
Another topic that was on the table at the event was the impact that a DevOps transformation has not only on the IT organization but also on the business. That was one of the key findings of the recently released fourth annual State of DevOps Report from Puppet Labs, another maker of IT automation software. "I don't see this trend going away," said Forsgren, who discussed the report findings during their talk at the conference. "DevOps is a strong place to place your bets."
The reason why improving the quality and frequency of software via DevOps can be linked with business performance is because software plays a key role in most businesses. "At this point, every company is a software company," Forsgren said. "If you can start to show clear value delivery using software doing DevOps, then you've got a stake in the game and you're not just doing things with IT."
A real life example of this: Jody Mulkey, a DevOps Enterprise Summit speaker, who told the Wall Street Journal that they were promoted to CTO at Live Nation's Ticketmaster in 2014, thanks in part to their DevOps skills, and their achievement of business-related goals during the year when they worked as executive VP of techops and platform engineering.
DevOps is no longer an outlier in enterprise IT
DevOps has traditionally been associated with leading edge tech companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Etsy, Google, which have famously adopted its way of working. This led many to question whether DevOps could only be implemented successfully at companies with extraordinary IT resources and knowledge.
At the conference, the testimonials came from very large companies with very large IT organizations but not precisely Silicon Valley giants: Target, Disney, Nordstrom, Capital One, Live Nation's Ticketmaster, Western Union. "The very existence of the DevOps Enterprise Summit in San Francisco was evidence of the extent to which DevOps has moved into the mainstream of corporate software development," wrote Rachael King, the Wall Street Journal reporter who covered the event.
Courtney Kissler, Vice President of E-Commerce and Store Technologies at Nordstrom, said during their presentation: "Everything that goes on in all areas of our business, technology is a key enabler. We're really focused on strategic flexibility so we don't paint ourselves into a corner."
To improve the chances of DevOps succeeding, nurture it from within in a methodic manner, and clear out bureaucratic obstacles. Holding internal mini-conferences, workshops, open labs, and setting up a team of inside experts helps to spread the word and generate enthusiasm about adopting DevOps and related practices and processes like lean, agile and continuous delivery.
That seemed to be the consensus from several presenters who spoke about implementing these tactics, including Target, which has opened a "dojo" to provide staff with immersive learning on DevOps and related topics. "I walked out of the Target talk seeing how dedicated space could be a measure of leadership buy-in for implementing DevOps and continuous improvement," wrote Dominica DeGrandis, LeanKit's Director of Learning & Development, in their blog.
Big Bang isn't the most effective way to introduce DevOps
Trying to mandate a top-down, wholesale adoption of DevOps in a large IT organization may not be the best approach. "We do see the greatest success when you do it on a project or product basis," Chef's Forsgren said.
Also key is that the initiative involve everyone on the value chain, from all teams: ops, devs, testing, quality assurance, compliance, user experience and so on. That way, the team can show business chiefs concrete improvements in a concrete project, for example, developing a customer-facing mobile app. From the success of such a specific project, a broader effort can start to spread organically. "You start building this groundswell," Forsgren said.
Nordstrom's Kissler stressed during their talk that it's important to recognize that in a large IT organization, different groups will be at different stages of proficiency in DevOps and related processes. The most advanced are at the "run" stage, while others are "walking" and "crawling."
"Not all teams are at the same pace," Kissler said.
The European Union has ordered Amazon to pay nearly $300 million over an alleged “illegal tax advantage,” according to a report.
According to the European Commission, Amazon, which was ordered to pay $294 million, “received tax advantages between 2006 and 2014 in the country without any ‘valid justification,'” while “in the period investigated, Amazon was shifting its profits from a company that was subject to tax in Luxembourg to another one that wasn't subject to tax, known as the ‘holding company,'” according to CNBC.
The company that the profits were moved to reportedly “had no employees, no offices and no business activities.” A spokesperson for Amazon reached out to Breitbart, noting the company has “1,500 employees in Luxembourg.”
In a statement, the European Union's Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, claimed Amazon was able to “pay four times less tax” than other companies.
“Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three-quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,” Vestager explained. “In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules.”
“This is illegal under EU state aid rules,” they continued, adding, “Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others.”
In response, Amazon claimed the company had acted in “full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.”
“We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal,” the company declared in a statement. “Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us.”
In June, the EU fined Google $2.7 billion in an anti-trust case, which was reported to be the biggest fine of its nature given to a single company.

Sunderland are close to finalising a behind-closed-doors friendly for the end of this week to keep players sharp for the Tyne-Wear derby.
Sam Allardyce's men are beginning a snail-paced spell of fixtures, where the trip to St James's Park on Sunday, March 20, will be their only Premier League outing in the next four weeks.
We will be able to let some of the players play who haven't played very much in a competitive match. Sam Allardyce
With Sunderland's bid to remain in the top flight on ice, Allardyce is keen to keep their players sharp for the final nine games - the first of which, against Newcastle, could be pivotal with the Magpies lying just one point adrift of the Black Cats in the relegation battle.
The likes of Seb Larsson and Younes Kaboul - who have both just returned from long stints on the treatment table - are in need of further game-time and Sunderland are close to arranging a friendly for Friday.
It won't be the first time Sunderland have played a behind-closed-doors friendly this season after the Black Cats thrashed Newcastle 6-0 in January.
Allardyce told the Echo: “We could play a friendly, although it depends on who we can get.
“I think if we can get a side that will put a reasonable team out then we could play one towards the end of next week behind closed doors.
“We will be able to let some of the players play who haven't played very much in a competitive match.
“If not, then we'll have to try to arrange a game between ourselves.”
Allardyce will drill their players hard on the training ground over the next fortnight though, in a bid to start accompanying Sunderland's positive performances with points.
Sunderland threw away two points after conceding a last-gasp equaliser at Southampton last weekend, to extend their run of Premier League games without a clean sheet to 15.
And it's not just at the back that Allardyce believes improvements can be made.
“The training programme will be different over the next two weeks and there'll be more emphasis on us being technically better in possession,” they added.
“We have to improve our final third play in delivery.
“I thought we got to the final third on a huge amount of occasions on Saturday, but could have provided that final ball better.
“And of course, the most important thing for me, is the defending.
“They're going to be so sick and tired of the defending practices that they'll be dreaming about it.”
By default, anytime you take a screen capture in Mac OS X, the resulting screenshot file will save to the current users desktop. This makes retrieval very easy and is very appropriate for the average Mac user, but for those who take a lot of screen shots in OS X, they may find their desktop to be cluttered with the screenshot files rather quickly.
An excellent solution is to adjust the default location of where Mac OS X saves captured screen shot files to another location in the file system when Command + Shift + 3 is pressed, this walkthrough will show you how to do that with a defaults command.
How to Change Where Screen Shots Save on Mac
You will need to use the command line to change the save location of screen shots in Mac OS X. Thus, the first thing you'll need to do is launch the Terminal app from /Applications/Utilities/ to get a prompt.
The general syntax for changing screenshot file location is as follows, note it must be entered on a single line and with a proper path set for the new screencapture save location to take effect:
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/;killall SystemUIServer
Change the ‘/path/' sequence to where you want the screen shot files to save to. For example, if I want to have the screenshots appear in the user (~) Pictures folder, I would use:
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/
Hit the return key to set ~/Pictures as the location. You'll need to follow it up with a SystemUIServer relaunch too:
killall SystemUIServer
Here is what this defaults sequence may look like as entered into the Terminals command line prompt:
Remember that ~ (tilde) is a shortcut to the current user home directory. A full path can be used as well, as we'll discuss in a moment.
If you want to make a unique folder within the ~/Pictures/ directory to save your screen shots too, you can do that from the Finder as usual, or from the command line with the following command to create a directory named “Screenshots”:
mkdir ~/Pictures/Screenshots/
Now to set that new directory as the default saved location for captured screen images use the following syntax:
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/Screenshots/
For the changes to take effect without rebooting, kill SystemUIServer process to relaunch it and set the location:
killall SystemUIServer
That's it, hit “Command+Shift+3” to take a screen shot and watch as the file is no longer saved to the user Desktop, but to the newly defined screen shot location.
This means the next time you take a screenshot (or as Windows converts like to say, Print Screen on a Mac), the screenshot file will appear at the location you specified.
Note that some users in the comments have experienced syntax issues when typing the tilde (~) as a shortcut for the Home folder, that shouldn't be an issue if used properly, but nonetheless you can get around that by implying a full path to the home directory as follows:
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/USERNAME/Pictures/
Where “USERNAME” is the precise shortname of the users home directory, followed by the desired path to set as the save location for future screen captures. Again, one must killall SystemUIServer or log out and back in again for the change to take effect.
Changing Back to the Default Screen Shot File Save Location in Mac OS X
If you decide having screencaptures automatically saved to another location on the Mac is no longer what you'd like to do, you can always change the saved screenshot location back to the OS X default setting simply by specifying the desktop again in the asupervisorstioned defaults command sequence. The default save location would thus be the following:
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/
Again, you'd need to kill SystemUIServer for changes to take effect.
killall SystemUIServer
You can again verify the change has been set back to the default by hitting Command+Shift+3 to capture the screen as a file in OS X, and look on the active user accounts desktop to find the screen shot file.
For many users, maintaining the Desktop as the default location of the screen shot files to generate is perfectly fine, this trick is really intended for individuals who use Command+Shift+3 for screen captures often and find the desktop file generation to be a distraction or otherwise difficult to manage. Users may also find useful to change the file name of generated screen shots as well as the image file type that is used, both of which can be widely customized to accommodate preferences.
This command works in all versions of Mac OS X.
MELBOURNE'S timetables are far too complicated and need to be drastically simplified as part of a major two-year regeneration of the rail network, the new head of the city's rail system says.
A ''run-to-failure philosophy'' that had endured under previous train operators was no longer good enough, Metro chief executive Andrew Lezala said yesterday in an interview with The Age.
''It is time for the railways to step up now and play our part in keeping Melbourne moving, because with another 1 million people coming in the next 15 years, the roads simply won't cope,'' they said.
Mr Lezala does not own a car in Melbourne, does not yet have a myki card and rides the tram to work from their inner-city home.
Yesterday, at the end of another torrid week for Melbourne train travellers - with 43-degree heat on Monday resulting in 247 of 2050 scheduled services being cancelled - Mr Lezala said the city deserved better.
The Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class is one of the older models in Mercedes-Benz's current line up. It is due for replacement in the summer of 2018. Test mules have recently began circulating as the replacement program gears up. This particular example was spotted testing with a huge amount of camouflage.
It is expected, despite rumours to the contrary, that the Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class will keep its current model designation. Some had speculated that, given its E-Class routes, the CLS-Class would become the CLE-Class for the next generation model. We are informed that this will not be the case.
Next Gen 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS 1 of 6
These photos are our best view yet of the CLS-Class successor model. Give the high levels of camouflage, it is difficult to glean any new information on the coupe-styled sedan. What we see is a new set of headlights and taillights at the very least. The camouflage does a successful job of hiding the real information.
Under the bonnet, there are expected to be bog changes. V6 models will make way for in-line 6-cylinder models. The noisy 2.1-litre four-cylinder turbodiesels will also be replaced by a more refined and less thirsty 2-litre unit.
Inside, expect the CLS-Class to come fitted with many of the technological highlights which have made the S-Class and E-Class models a run-away success. Autonomous driving features and dual interior displays. We're expecting the 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLS to be available exclusively as a four-door coupe. There will be no CLS Shooting Brake successor.

In mid June, Rémi Mathis, chairperson of Wikimédia France, signed a partnership with the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (Association of Universities of the Francophonie – AUF) and the Institut Français (IF) to support a project called Afripedia. This initiative supports the development of Internet access in countries where, for now, the network is not stable and affordable enough. In French-speaking Africa, where most people have limited, expensive and poor quality access to the Internet, the goal is to encourage contribution and access to free knowledge. Wikimédia France intends to support future local contributor communities to move Wikipedia forward in French and in local languages.
The partnership is facilitated by the work of Kiwix developers, who for several years have been facilitating offline versions of Wikipedia in various languages. Utilizing the Kiwix platform, content from Wikipedias in different languages can be downloaded and shared all over the world to be used in diverse ways.
For Afripedia, Wikimédia France –working with Kiwix, the AUF and IF — will establish offline WiFi systems in areas where internet is not prevalent. The system essentially works like an Intranet. We will install small computers (Plug Computers) without screens or keyboards, which are very energy-efficient. Then we will connect a flash drive with the content of Wikipedia (and maybe other Wikimedia projects, like Wiktionary, etc.) and all the content will be shared by WiFi with all the computers that receive the WiFi network. To update content, you just have to update the original flash drive and every computer will receive the new information. We think that this system is better than the traditional sharing of content with flash drives or DVD, because it allows for easier and more accessible updates.
In a lot of countries, the AUF has a network of digital campuses near universities. We are in partnership with the AUF in order to benefit from that network and logistical help. We will start by setting up the project in about 20 universities in 15 countries in West-Africa and by training the staff to use Wikipedia, especially for educational use.
But we also want to encourage contribution by African people on African topics, given that there is too little coverage of those on Wikipedia. For this purpose, while we develop the offline dissemination of Wikipedia, we will organize tutorials and workshops to make it easier to contribute and collaborate with the Wikipedia community. With this training, we're hopeful users will be able to contribute more easily when their internet connection allows them to do so.
If the project goes well, we intend to develop it further in 2013 with help from the AUF and IF. We're starting with universities, but we can consider sharing Wikipedia content this way in schools, cultural centers and even (with wireless repeaters) in residential areas and villages.
This is a particular and unique experience for us to take part to this kind of project. It is very interesting to work with institutions with extensive experience in educationnal and cultural development. Since we have announced this partnership, and based on coverage in African media outlets, we have received several contacts from associations or people involved in cultural development. This should allow us to support new communities of contributors (and maybe future wikimedia chapters?) in these countries.
We look forward to updating you on our progress as the initiative proceeds.

The Houston flood, the anarchy of the capitalist market and the case for socialist planning
30 August 2017
The disaster along the US Gulf Coast triggered by Hurricane Harvey continues to worsen as the storm moves east into Louisiana. Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, remains inundated by unprecedented levels of flooding. The reported death toll is 30 and rising, amid reports of dozens of residents gone missing. Five days after landfall, it is still not known how many people are in need of rescue.
Even as the level of death and destruction in southeast Texas mounts, there is a concerted effort to deny that anything could have been done to prepare for or limit the impact of the storm.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator William “Brock” Long proclaimed that the disaster was impossible to foresee. “You could not forecast this up. You could not dream this forecast up,” Long said Monday night. Uncritically quoting Long, the Washington Post published a front-page article with the headline: “Rescue officials say there was no way to prepare for deluge's ferocity.”
In its editorial on Tuesday, the New York Times wrote that rescue efforts were going “about as well as could be expected.” It added that instead of “lamenting its failure to heed long-ago warnings,” the country should “look ahead.” Ominously, it suggested that, as in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, working class areas of Houston might be left to rot, declaring that officials will need to “make difficult decisions about whether to rebuild and how.”
Twelve years after Katrina, nothing has been done to strengthen flood control systems and build up the social infrastructure to limit the impact of major storms. Nor has anything been done to plan and prepare emergency and public safety measures to deal with a severe weather event. Repeated warnings and urgent recommendations, such as were contained in the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2014 report, “Call for a National Flood Risk Management Strategy,” have gone entirely unheeded.
Robert Bea, an emeritus civil engineering professor at UC Berkeley and expert on hurricane risks on the Gulf Coast, told the Los Angeles Times that the official claim that Houston's flood control system could protect the population from a 100-year storm was a “100-year lie.” The 100-year claim, they explained, is based on the city receiving a maximum of 13 inches of rain in 24 hours, something that has happened more than eight times in the last 27 years.
The reason why these warnings have been ignored is not hard to fathom. They have been resolutely opposed by corporate interests, including the real estate industry, Wall Street and Big Oil. Their ability, operating through bribed politicians of both parties, to veto and block elementary measures to protect the American people, exemplifies the complete subordination of all social needs under capitalism to the selfish drive of a corporate-financial oligarchy to accumulate ever greater levels of personal wealth and profit.
Texas, and the city of Houston in particular, have been hailed as exemplars of the “success” of completely deregulated, free market capitalism. The home of the Bush dynasty and a center of the oil and gas behemoths, Houston is the largest city in the country without any zoning laws to regulate urban development. There are no serious limits on real estate speculators and developers, who have systematically ignored warnings by engineers and scientists on the consequences of paving over wetlands and prairie lands, which soak up heavy rains, with impermeable concrete.
The city's urban sprawl now covers some 600 square miles. Thousands of new homes have been built in flood plains since 2010. City planners know that Houston lies in a highly flood-prone region, but have done nothing to stop the destruction of the natural barriers that once limited flooding. The thousands of workers who have lost their livelihoods from Hurricane Harvey are the victims of the criminal negligence of government officials who do the bidding of avaricious property developers, oil magnates and bankers.
There was ample warning of a flood catastrophe. There was the near miss in 2008 with Hurricane Ike, which slammed into Galveston. Three rain storms since 2015 caused major flooding outside of areas deemed by FEMA to be at high risk. Longstanding discussions of extending and fortifying infrastructure to protect Houston and other coastal cities from storm surge have never gone beyond the planning stage. The city's antiquated and inadequate flood control infrastructure, built decades ago, has collapsed.
President Donald Trump's visit to Texas on Tuesday exemplified the callous indifference of the American ruling elite toward the plight of working class victims of its greed and neglect, along with an astonishing degree of ignorance as to what masses of people are thinking.
At a staged event at the crisis management center in Corpus Christi, Trump, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and FEMA Administrator Long congratulated one another on their marvelous response to the flood disaster. They presented the obscene spectacle of chaos and incompetence on the part of the authorities, which is evoking shock and outrage across the country and around the world, as a model of compassion and efficiency.
Abbott, a longtime political asset of the oil industry, slavishly praised Trump, the representative of the real estate interests that have ruthlessly plundered Houston and led it to its present fate.
Behind the scenes, discussions are already underway about how to take advantage of the crisis, as in post-Katrina New Orleans, to go even further in ripping up regulations, privatizing public assets and slashing wages.
It is critical that working people and youth begin to draw the necessary political conclusions from this latest so-called “natural disaster.” The catastrophe unfolding in Texas is not, after all, the first such event. The past 12 years alone have seen a succession of events that exposed the staggering levels of social inequality and poverty that pervade American society, along with the indifference and criminality of the ruling corporate oligarchy: Katrina in 2005, BP Oil in 2010, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and now Houston.
All of these disasters are, in fact, social crimes. They demonstrate the incompatibility of modern complex societies with an outmoded and irrational economic system based on the anarchy of the capitalist market and the drive of financial oligarchs for more and more personal wealth. Thousands of people in Houston are losing everything, many their very lives, so that billionaire gangsters like Trump can buy bigger mansions and yachts and keep bribing the political hacks who defend their wealth and power.
These tragic events demonstrate in the negative the urgent need for the reorganization of economic and social life on the basis of rational planning, science, public ownership and control, and the democratic participation of the broad masses, both in the US and internationally.
The outpouring of solidarity and the organization of rescue efforts by ordinary people from Houston and around the country testify to the potential for the development of such a society. What stands in the way? It is the barbaric oligarchy that exerts a stranglehold on the wealth and productive forces of society. The chief lesson of Hurricane Harvey is that this obstacle must be removed from the scene of history. The only social force that can achieve this is the working class.

I would just like to clarify my understanding of what's happening with the FISA debate.
The Democrats were ready to give George Bush everything that they wanted on FISA. They used Senate procedure to tank the Judiciary bill, paving the way for the Intelligence Committee bill (negotiated by Jay Rockefeller and the White House) with retroactive immunity for the telecoms. They were all lined up to vote for it save for a few meaningless tweaks; Dodd was going to filibuster but eventually that would end and Bush would get everything they wanted.
The Republicans decided that wasn't enough. They decided they would filibuster the "meaningless tweaks" just to humiliate the Democrats even further, then filed for cloture on the Intelligence Committee bill and scheduled the vote right before the State of the Union address. The Democrats either swallow the Intel bill whole or George Bush gets up there on Monday night and screams about how the Democrats are letting the terrorists win.
The Democrats are now lined up to block cloture on the very bill they were ready to pass yesterday. George Bush will publicly humiliate them for it in the SOTU, and with the Protect America Act ready to sunset on Friday February 1st, the Democrats will either find a way to extend it for another 30 days or give the Republicans everything they want anyway out of fear of being called soft on terrah.
Ah bipartisanship.
Neither of the Democratic Senators currently running for President will commit to be in the Senate for the vote on Monday (I've contacted both campaigns — the Obama campaign says he'll be in DC but aren't sure of their schedule, and the Clinton campaign hasn't responded.)
Am I missing anything?
Frankston MP Geoff Shaw plans to apply for a magistrate to hear the charges against him, which allege they used their parliamentary car for their own benefit and claimed more than $2000 in expenses on a government fuel card.
Mr Shaw made a brief appearance at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday in relation to charges that could, if proven, end their parliamentary career and bring down the Napthine government, which relies on the independent MP's vote to govern.
Mr Shaw, 45, is charged with 23 counts of dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and one count of misconduct in public office over allegations they misused their parliamentary vehicle and fuel card. Both offences carry maximum 10-year jail sentences.
Police allege Mr Shaw used the car and fuel card to make deliveries for their hardware business across Victoria and interstate.
BOSSES all over the Western world have been warned. Unless they make allowances for the religious faiths of their ever more diverse workforces, they will suffer lawsuits, official rebukes and protests from staff. Employees increasingly expect to be able, for example, to dress in accordance with their faith while at work, and be given appropriate times and places for prayer.
The latest admonition came last month in new guidelines from America's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, pointing out the steady rise in religious-discrimination cases (3,721 last year, up from 1,709 in 1997) and setting out what that means. For example, businesses must respect the personal styles of their staff—Rastafarian dreadlocks, say—if these are inspired by faith. And religiously attired workers must not be hidden away to avoid upsetting customers of a different faith.

European firms are still absorbing the impact of last year's victory by a British Airways worker (pictured) who won damages at the European Court of Human Rights after they were denied, temporarily, the right to wear a cross with their uniform. In advice updated last month, Britain's Equality and Human Rights Commission urges firms to meet religious needs, even if expressed by only one employee, as long as they do not infringe the rights of others.
Among other high-profile cases last year, Abercrombie & Fitch, an American clothes retailer, paid $71,000 to settle cases brought by two Muslim women (an ex-employee and a job applicant) who said they were victimised for wearing headscarves. And Tesco, a British grocer, was rebuked by an employment tribunal after two Muslim employees complained that access to the prayer-room had been restricted.
The pressure on bosses to let employees display their beliefs more openly comes at a time when they are having to be more guarded about expressing their own. On April 3rd Brendan Eich resigned as boss of Mozilla, an American internet-software firm, following a row over their earlier support for a campaign to ban gay marriage in California. And in 2012 civil-rights groups called for a boycott of Chick-fil-A, a fast-food chain, after a senior executive publicly opposed gay marriage.
The dividing line, it seems, is between indicating one's faith and spelling out what it means in practice: devout Jews or Muslims, say, may wear kippahs or hijabs at work, but any manifestation of traditionalist religious views on morality would still be unacceptable—such as shunning colleagues of the opposite sex, or expressing disapproval of homosexuality.
Multinational firms have the added difficulty of coping with different expectations in each of the countries where they operate. A 2009 survey of 23 countries compiled for Ius Laboris, a global alliance of law firms, found that all had legal or constitutional bans on religious discrimination, but they varied in how they defined religion. Britain stands out for the range of personal beliefs that may be deemed worthy of protection: Wiccans, for example, can wear their pentacles with pride.
Firms stung by criticism and legal cases, such as BA and Abercrombie, have changed their rules to meet employees' expectations. But the job keeps getting harder. In America foreign-born workers are now nearly 15% of the total, up from 5% in 1970, says Joyce Dubensky of the Tanenbaum Centre for Interreligious Understanding, in New York. Their bosses, they say, must adapt not only to more faiths, but new mixtures: Latino workers may follow Catholic and indigenous beliefs at the same time. The upside is that “well-managed diversity is a magnet for talent.”
Even in countries where the official climate is secular, practical responses tend to prevail. The French version of secularism lays down that the public sector is religion-free, but private bodies have a somewhat freer hand. A state agency, the Observatory on Secularism, offers advice to firms, mixing warnings against open religious discrimination (punishable by jail, in theory) with assurances that companies can restrict proselytising by staff.
One French firm, a recycling company called Paprec, said in February that it was introducing a secularist regime (banning conspicuous religious symbols, as French schools do) by agreement with its 4,000 workers. But Nathalie Luca, a French scholar of religion, calls this case an outlier; most businesses are reacting flexibly when presented with religious demands, such as Muslim prayer rooms. In French-speaking Quebec, likewise, the private sector has responded sceptically to an effort by the Canadian province's government to copy Gallic secularism.
All this does not mean that any case brought against an employer on religious grounds will prevail. Last October a meat-packing firm in America was vindicated by a court in its refusal to grant extra prayer breaks to about 200 Somali Muslim workers, at times that varied according to the rules for worship during Ramadan. The company tried to allow this but non-Muslim staff protested that the concessions were going too far, and it was facing costly disruptions to output. The judge endorsed the firm's stance on the ground that the Civil Rights Act says religion must be accommodated as long as that does not cause “undue hardship” to the employer.
President-elect Donald Trump made the unfounded claim Sunday they won the popular vote in the presidential election — if millions of so-called “illegal votes” had not been counted.
“In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” they tweeted.
There is no evidence that millions voted illegally.
Tallies of the popular vote show that Hillary Clinton beat Trump by more than 2 million votes, though Trump won more Electoral College vote and therefor the presidency.

“It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited,” Trump wrote. “I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!”
The latest tweets came after Trump railed against the election recount effort by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, calling it a “scam” and saying “nothing will change.” Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin and said they would file for recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania as well, after people pointed to anomalies in voting data in the three swing states.
In a series of Twitter posts on Sunday, the independent investigative news website ProPublica said its extensive election monitoring had revealed no evidence of systemic fraud, and that for millions of people to vote illegally “would require a conspiracy larger than all previous conspiracy theories combined.”

US forming a Raqqa supply line The United States' preparations regarding the Raqqa operation have accelerated; they have started forming supply lines and delivering logistics equipment. A portion of the heavy weapons have already arrived, but more will come.
The U.S.' Raqqa plan is not clear yet. The Pentagon and U.S. Central Command (Centcom) obviously want to conduct the Raqqa operation with the People's Protection Units (YPG) and not with Turkey. It is up to the political will now. U.S. President Donald Trump found the Raqqa plan prepared during the Obama era inadequate and ordered a new plan to be prepared. The new Raqqa plan has been submitted to Trump who has not made a decision yet. The Pentagon took advantage of Trump's indecisiveness and moved ahead, with preparations by military units accelerating.
Chief of General Staff Gen. Hulusi Akar presented the Raqqa plan to U.S. Chief of General Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford at a meeting at the İncirlik Air Base. The plan suggested in general that the Free Syrian Army and local Arab components within the Syrian Democratic Forces and Roj Peshmarga units could conduct a joint operation with intense air support from Turkey and the U.S., as well as the Turkish and American special forces.
As long as it is not rejected, the Raqqa plan of Ankara is on the table, but Turkey's option looks weak. The U.S. has been investing in the YPG for three years in joint operation and training. In the past year, it started giving it heavy weapons.
The Pentagon indicated its intentions on Raqqa by showing its flag in Manbij. The U.S., which prevented a Manbij operation against the YPG, created major difficulties during the al-Bab operation while it was cleared of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Despite all this, Turkey cleared ISIL from Jarablus, Dabiq and al-Bab. With the Euphrates Shield Operation Turkey prevented the unification of the Afrin and Kobane cantons. The U.S. is annoyed because of this. Also, they find it dangerous for their long-term plans that the Turkish military presence is controlling a region up to al-Bab.
The dominant thought in Ankara is that the Raqqa operation has been delayed until the end of April or beginning of May. Planning and preparations are ongoing. Looking at the work in the field, there is a feeling that the operation will start even earlier.
The Pentagon's Raqqa plan submitted to Trump has two legs, the Syrian and the Iraqi legs. U.S. Special Forces are expected to be airlifted to Arbil or Tal Afar, then enter Syria from there following the Sinjar line and passing the Rabia gate. The 4,000 Roj Peshmargas the U.S. had trained in Dohuk will go in beforehand to secure the operation line.
There will be a high-capacity supply line in Sinjar. In the Raqqa planning, YPG and Roj Peshmarga units will conduct the Raqqa siege; the U.S. will provide support with intense air strikes. The American Special Forces will step in during urban operations.
Here is a new piece of information: Photographs have started arriving of the advance guards that have reached the Raqqa border.
There is also the other side of the coin. Under the name of Raqqa operation, the U.S. is equipping the YPG with heavy weapons. The U.S. has a characteristic. When the operation is over, it does not withdraw these weapons.
In Iraq, it did not take back the weapons it brought during the invasion. Well, what will it do with the weapons it has given to the YPG? Apparently, it will not take them back. Where will the YPG direct these weapons? Of course at us.
The issue will not end with the completion of the Raqqa operation together with the YPG, as there is still the aftermath yet to come.
Jazz great Wynton Marsalis, a virtuoso trumpet player and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer, has written — wait for it — a violin concerto.
As the daughter of the late virtuoso violinist Roman Totenberg, I was intrigued and wanted to know more. So I spent an hour with Marsalis — and the violinist they wrote their concerto with and for. (More on that later.)
At 55, Marsalis has spent a lifetime exploring the roots of American music. True, they admit, they have never played the violin, but they add that if composers wrote only for instruments they could play, the world's musical repertoire would be pretty limited.
Besides, Marsalis says, "I love the violin. I always felt that if you're going to write American music and use strings, you have to learn about fiddlin'." Especially if you look at the "slave tradition of fiddlin'."
"A lot of slaves were fiddlers," they observe. "A slave that could fiddle was worth as much as a buck, even more sometimes."
Some of the American fiddling tradition seems evident in the wild, hair-flying, foot-stomping style of the Scottish violinist for whom Marsalis composed their concerto, 29-year-old Nicola Benedetti. The two met when they were just 17, after they heard them perform.
Now, after a two-year collaboration on Concerto in D, they're finishing each other's thoughts like a verbal fugue, with plenty of counterpoint — first one voice, and then the other, expounding on a theme.
"I like their sound," Marsalis says. "I like the way they play, and also I knew them For me, most times when I write music, it's very personal. "
"And I kept asking," Benedetti says. They kept asking Marsalis to write a piece for her, even though they aren't entirely sure what they would get. "I can't say I had an idea. I was just quite sure it would be a good idea."
Nicola Benedetti, prior to performing Wynton Marsalis' violin concerto with the National Symphony Orchestra last week. (NPR)
Marsalis knew they would learn a lot from Benedetti about writing for the violin. That learning came quickly — when they sent them the first page of their concerto.
"When I first sent them the music," they say, "she was like ... man, you need to — this music is not complicated enough!"
Benedetti was unsparing. "'I'm going to send you the first page of some of these concertos [Brahms, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky],'" they remember them telling him. "'And you look at these pages to make your music look like this.'"
They aren't offended. "I knew we had that kind of rapport. I wasn't insulted by it," they say. Quite the contrary, they add, it was a thrill to be asked to make something more complicated instead of more simple.
The two worked together, often across transatlantic phone lines, for months on end. Benedetti would pick up their violin and put their phone on speaker — and across the Atlantic in the U.S., Marsalis would do the same at the piano. The work, they say, was painstakingly slow.
"Note by note, 'Can you play an E flat with that C sharp?' 'Yes.' ... 'Can you play a D, can you play another C sharp?' 'No.' And it was also fascinating for me to see." After all, they say, "When do you ever get to see inside someone's composing process with that much detail?"
"I always would tell her," Marsalis interjects, "if you want something different, it's not going to be that hard. I'll come up with something."
And, Benedetti says, "the speed at which they come up with 15 options for me is just unbelievable."
The concerto is in four movements: "Rhapsody," "Rondo," "Blues" and the finale, called "Hootenanny." As critic Howard Reich described it, the piece takes "a largely populist approach, endowing the concerto with sweeping melodies, brilliant orchestration" and "many shades of Americana."
Benedetti wishes Marsalis would call their piece something other than Concerto in D. "I think it's begging for a title," they say. "To me, the overall theme is the American story, the integration of cultures." That is "by far the loudest message," they say.
Their disagreement over the title isn't the only conflict the violinist and composer have encountered. They might have achieved a mind-meld with the music — but they also fight.
"Do we argue? Of course, we have very tense moments," Marsalis admits. "She wants me to change something. I don't want to change it. So I fight. She'll fight about it."
And the thing they still have not stopped fighting about is the piece's ending. After a raucous, rapid-fire, rhythmic last movement, the finale is a fade-out.
"It goes into a kind of wistful dance of something, ancestral memory," Marsalis says in an ethereal tone.
Benedetti is having none of it. "It disappears," they mutter.
Marsalis, with a tiny grin: "She doesn't like that."
It's a conflict between the intellect of the composer and the dramatic sense of the performer. "My concern," Benedetti says, "is not from sort of intellectual standpoint. It's how I understand violin concertos to be perceived by the audience."
In short, they want a big ending, an exclamation point, something that will make the audience stand up and cheer.
For now, Marsalis is resisting.
So is this concerto finished now, or is it a work in progress?
"I never finish any of my music till I finish it," Marsalis says. "I don't rush to finish it. I'm not competing with anybody. I wrote it for them If they say it's not finished, I'll work on it some more.
"If I feel it's not finished, I'll work on it until I die."

Sailor
Sailor re-released their old Jentle inks (Grenade, Apricot etc.) I feel this was strange not only because it was so soon (too soon in my opinion) after retiring the inks but also because it was US only. I get that Sailor inks aren't as popular in Europe (and Australia doesn't really count) but I don't understand why they wouldn't supply to Asia as well. Sailor does seem to be getting more cosy with their US distribution with plenty of US retailers (and not just Vanness as it has been in recent times) now stocking Bungubox and Kobe inks. Bungubox have also re-opened international shipping direct from Bungubox (but shipping isn't pretty) which had been closed for a while. I think this is a great sign of Sailor taking the international market more seriously and putting more attention to it. That doesn't mean I expect (or want!) all the Japanese store exclusives to be open to everyone.
A focus of my ink collection this year has been the Japanese store exclusives. They are pricy but they are also fun to track down and find out how to order. It's a game to hunt them down (and even discover them). This is obviously not something everyone wants to do but I find it fun. There's also something rewarding about collecting an difficult to acquire ink (and especially a difficult to acquire limited edition ink!).
What Sailor are doing moving forward seems a little up in the air. In Japan they have released some new inks in 20ml bottles (the 20ml Storia bottles) and have also moved all their Jentle inks (apart from Blue, Blue Black, Black, Sei Boku and Kiwa Guro which are in new 50ml square bottles) to these tiny 20ml bottles… and didn't drop the price. This is a very large increase in price and 20ml, to me, is just way too small. I don't think a proper bottle of ink should drop bellow 30ml. 20ml is just a sample bottle (think Iroshizuku or J.Herbin) rather than the proper bottle. I am worried about how Sailor will be producing inks moving forward. I hear that the US will continue getting 50ml but what about Japanese store exclusives? If they don't change, the store exclusives will actually be noticeably cheaper than the standard line. I expect these exclusives to jump up in price and I'm hoping they don't move them to smaller bottles and get rid of the beautiful vase bottles. Bungubox released a set of inks based on the Tokyo subway that were in the new 20ml bottles but as this is a set of inks I don't think much can be read into it.
I don't think Sailor's 2018 is going to be cheap. Especially if you are buying from Japan. A bit of a worry for me about what is my favourite ink brand.
Pilot
Two Tokyo exclusive limited edition additions to the Iroshizuku lineup is all that changed. Pilot initially release the Iroshizuku inks in a series (and not in one go). I'd like them to add an ink to the lineup every now and then to revitalise the set. Maybe even some international limited editions. It's difficult to get Japanese makers to expand their attention internationally but I can hope (especially as Sailor has started to do so).
Platinum
With the release 6 Iron Gall inks, Platinum made a bit of a splash mid year. I can't remember Platinum doing much interesting before this (happy to be wrong) so it's great to see them expanding. Interestingly some or all of the inks weren't new and they approached “pgary” to use some of the inks they created. I'm not sure how much the inks are modified from the originals that Gary made but this is an interesting approach. I'd love for them to expand this Iron Gall lineup next year.
Kyo iro and Kyo no oto
These inks have been around a little while but really picked up in popularity more recently when they expanded their distribution channels. This is great to see as there are some unique colours in these inks. They are slow to release the new inks to the non-Japanese market and their limited editions don't make it at all but that's fine as well, in my opinion. I'm honestly happy with how this brand is moving along. New inks are steadily coming but nothing too fast that it's difficult to keep up.
Miscellaneous Inks
Krishna seems to be rotating through their inks somewhat frequently. Retiring older inks and introducing new ones and even some limited edition ones. Some of the inks are pretty - damn - impressive but their problem is distribution. The inks are themselves are very cheap at around US$3-4 but the problem is shipping. I believe India Post won't ship liquids so Krishna inks have to be sent via a courier service like FedEx. The cheapest shipping method they could offer me was US$60 for up to 15 inks. This worked out to be US$6.62 per bottle and .33¢ per ml. This isn't terrible at all but it is a commitment to buy 15 inks at US$6.62 each and it is disappointing for most of that money to go to FedEx rather than the ink maker! iZods in the UK are selling the inks (at a higher price) so it's good to see the inks make their way out of India. I do hope they find a way to reduce distribution costs (which I believe they are working on!).
It's good to see some inks coming from South Korea with Egoistar and Colorverse. The latter looks very interesting (though expensive) and the idea of getting two bottles of the same ink (one big and one small) is certainly unique. Some interesting colours as well. Definitely eager to try these.
2018
I'm somewhat expecting sheen to be the “thing” for next year. The success of sheening inks this year will encourage more to be made. I'm not sure how long ink brands will continue to pursue shimmering inks but I can't imagine they'd continued to expand exponentially like they have. I'd like for more Iron Gall inks come out from different brands.
This is an expansion on two previous posts: my husband's guest post Precision – A Basic Motivation Mistake in Some Western Training then my follow-up post How to “Train Like a Thai” – Why Many Get it Wrong and then lastly Training with Hippy Singmanee – With Relaxation Comes Power. It's part of an informal relaxation series.
One of the hardest things to learn is how to relax in contact sports. It's also one of the most important things and something that separates “good” from “great.” This is by no means an exhaustive list and most of these are just observations and tactics I've used in my own path toward greater freedom from relaxation, something I'm concentrating on more recently.
Initially, my first response to my trainers telling me to relax was, “you're hitting me in the face, it's hard to relax.” I think that my assumption was a common one, which is that relaxation is being inert. But when I think about things that I can relax while doing, it's more that I'm neutral, unaffected, or even enjoying myself. But overall it's a lack of tension, which is where the call from trainers comes from. “Relax,” means “don't be so tense.”
Breathe. Yeah, it's obvious to the point that it sounds useless, but it's the base of everything. Every time you fall asleep, it's because you're breathing deeply and steadily. Ultimate relaxation. In all my experiences of doing well or doing badly, it has to do with my breathing; if I'm tired versus if I'm flowing, it has to do with my breathing. Kevin reads a lot of theory and in all of the military strategy and combat training talks about getting the heart-rate down through breathing. One technique is as follows: inhale with a count of 4, hold that breath for a count of 4, exhale at a count of 4, hold that breath for a count of 4. I do this before starting padwork or between rounds if I feel I'm nervous or too excited. Shift. Take yourself out of the task that's making you tense. If you're sparring and growing too tense, try to put your mind somewhere else. Singing a song in your head, doing math, thinking about dinner, or even “performing” as one of your favorite fighters or just any confident personality, like a rockstar. I like to imitate my favorite fighters and this little 12 year old at my gym likes to imitate Saenchai. All the kids at the gym will call out the name of a fighter when they're stealing one of their signature moves; even my trainer does it. It helps turn it into play. Teep. When we stop breathing because of being overwhelmed by pressure, we need space. We backpedal or swing our arms furiously to try to get the pressure off of us, but any opponent worth their salt sees when you need to breathe and go after you. The teep is an active rest. You can keep someone off of you to not feel so crowded and you're controlling the distance so you don't have to feel like you're retreating. A good, well-timed teep is a brilliant way to catch your breath. Smile. I hate this one because I've lived my life as a female and so all those in the category can sympathize with the agitation of this – women do not like being told to smile. But, but, in this case I'm suggesting it as a way to cheat into a different frame of mind. It's like lying (which smiling in the real world can be also), but you can convince yourself also. If someone lands a strike on you and you smile, they are often confused. And you don't make too big of a deal of it to yourself by starting the internal dialogue of the super critical coach inside your head. Identify. Identity when you are relaxed. If you can't find a moment in training context, pick one outside of it. When you are sitting reading a book, are you relaxed? Is watching Netflix relaxing? Okay, so identify what your body and mind feel like when you are relaxed and then go sit in a chair and recreate those feelings. When you start feeling tension, return to relaxation. It sounds odd, but sometimes it can be difficult to even know what relaxation feels like, especially for those who spend a lot of time in stress. Once you've figured out how to better identify the difference between relaxed and tensed, bring that to the context of the gym. Start doing a simple exercise, like hitting the bag or even just shadowboxing the same 1-2, 1-2. When you feel tension growing stop and return to relaxation, then start again and try to maintain it being at ease. Anytime you feel tension, abandon your efforts and return to relaxation until you can start up your efforts again while trying to remain relaxed. But don't stress it; go slow. If it's hard, go slower…take your foot off the gas. “Shake it out” as you go. If you feel tension in your shoulders, drop your hands and shake your arms out. I see my clinching partner Team do this all the time – they kind of flicks their fists down to loosen up their arms. If you're tense as you're doing pads, take a moment to bounce in place and “shake out” the tension before throwing your next strike. Likewise, if you're babbling away in your mind about how tense you are, shake that out too, mentally. Your mind doesn't have to be blank or clear, just quiet. Don't hold thoughts.
“Mental training requires a skillful balance of disciplined effort and joyful relaxation, which means the more joyful relaxation you can already count on, the more disciplined effort you can commit, and the more of both you have, the faster you can establish attentional stability.” – Joy on Demand, Kindle page 105

First glimpse into birth of the Milky Way
For almost 20 years astrophysicists have been trying to recreate the formation of spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way realistically. Now astrophysicists from the University of Zurich present the world's first realistic simulation of the formation of our home galaxy together with astronomers from the University of California at Santa Cruz. The new results were partly calculated on the computer of the Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) and show, for instance, that there has to be gas on the outer edge of the Milky Way.
The aim of astrophysical simulations is to model reality in due consideration of the physical laws and processes. Astronomical sky observations and astrophysical simulations have to match up exactly. Being able to simulate a complex system like the formation of the Milky Way realistically is the ultimate proof that the underlying theories of astrophysics are correct. All previous attempts to recreate the formation of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way faltered on one of two points: Either the simulated spiral galaxies displayed too many stars at the center or the overall stellar mass was several times too big. A research group jointly run by Lucio Mayer, an astrophysicist at the University of Zurich, and Piero Madau, an astronomer at University of California at Santa Cruz, is now publishing the first realistic simulation of the formation of the Milky Way in the Astrophysical Journal. Javiera Guedes and Simone Callegari, who are PhD students at Santa Cruz and the University of Zurich respectively, performed the simulation and analyzed the data. Guedes will be working on the formation of galaxies as a postdoc in Zurich from the fall.
Removing standard matter central to formation of spiral galaxies
For their study, the scientists developed a highly complex simulation in which a spiral galaxy similar to the Milky Way develops by itself without further intervention. Named after Eris, the Greek goddess of strife and discord, because of the decades of debate surrounding the formation of spiral galaxies, the simulation offers a glimpse in time lapse into almost the entire genesis of a spiral galaxy. Its origins date back to less than a million years after the Big Bang. “Our result shows that a realistic spiral galaxy can be formed based on the basic principles of the cold dark matter paradigm and the physical laws of gravity, fluid dynamics and radiation physics,” explains Mayer.
The simulation also shows that in an entity that is supposed to develop into a spiral galaxy, the stars
form in the areas where giant cloud complexes are. In these cold giant molecular clouds, the gas exhibits extremely high densities. The star formation and distribution there does not occur uniformly, but rather in clumps and clusters. This in turn results in a considerably greater build-up of heat through local supernova explosions. Through this massive build-up of heat, visible standard matter is removed at high redshift. This prevents the formation of a bulge in the center of the galaxy. The removal of baryonic matter, as the visible standard matter is also known, also reduces the overall mass of the gas present at the center. This results in the formation of the correct stellar mass, as can be observed in the Milky Way. At the end of the simulation, a thin, curved disk results that corresponds fully to the astronomical observations of the Milky Way in terms of the mass, angular momentum and rotation velocity ratios.

Astronomical computing power
For the calculations, the model Mayer and co. developed for the simulation of disk-shaped dwarf galaxies and published in the journal Nature in 2010 was refined. The high-resolution model simulates the formation of a galaxy with 790 billion solar masses and comprises 18.6 million particles, from which gas, dark matter and stars form. The high resolution of the numerical simulations is essential for the groundbreaking new results. For the calculations, the high-performance supercomputers Cray XT5 “Monte Rosa” at ETH Zurich's Swiss National Supercomputing Center (CSCS) and the NASA Advanced Supercomputer Division's Pleiades were used. A regular PC would have needed 570 years for the calculations.
Stars and gas at the outermost edge of the galaxy, hot gas at its center
The new simulation confirms the results for the formation of disk-shaped dwarf galaxies published by Mayer and demonstrates that the model – unlike all previous approaches – can recreate both small and extremely large galaxies realistically. Moreover, from the simulation it an also be deduced that protogalaxies with a large disk made of gas and stars at the center already formed a billion years after the Big Bang, and therefore long before our present galaxies.
Based on the simulation, the ratio of “cold dark matter” (CDM) and standard matter in spiral galaxies can also be adjusted. In order to obtain the correct overall stellar mass in the final stage of the galaxy – until now, one of the main difficulties – it is imperative that standard matter be removed from the center by supernova winds. On the strength of the simulation, it is highly probable that the ratio of standard matter to CDM on the outermost edge of the CDM rings of a spiral galaxy is 1:9, not 1:6 as previously assumed.
The simulation also predicts stars and gas for the outer halo of the Milky Way six hundred thousand light years away. Only the next generation of space probes and telescopes will be able to detect these extremely faint stars. Furthermore, the simulation makes predictions with regard to the radial distribution of hot gas around the galaxy's central disk. Future telescopes that can measure X-rays, as the IXO Mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) is planning, for example, will test these predictions.

On top, an edge-on image of our simulated galaxy, as an observer would see it if they could enter in the computer and look at the light emitted by our simulated stars. They could clearly see that the galaxy is composed by a thin disk of stars, and a brighter, small bulge at the center. At the bottom, a real image of our Milky Way galaxy as you would see it in infrared, where stars emit most of their light. Here too the Milky Way is seen edge-on, as our solar system lies in the plane of the disk.
With a mellifluous name suggesting bucolic tranquility, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, is an unlikely object of the caterwauling recently directed at them and the House Freedom Caucus they lead. The vituperation was occasioned by the HFC's role rescuing Republicans from embracing an unpopular first draft of legislation to replace Obamacare.
A decisive blow against the bill was struck by the quintessential Republican moderate, New Jersey's Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairperson of the Appropriations Committee, A decisive blow against the bill was struck by the quintessential Republican moderate, New Jersey's Rodney Frelinghuysen, chairperson of the Appropriations Committee, whose family has included a member of the Continental Congress, four U.S. senators and, in 1844, a vice-presidential nominee : “Hurrah! Hurrah! The country's risin', for Henry Clay and Frelinghuysen.”
Although just a little over two years old, the HFC signals a revival of congressional resistance to the dangerous waxing of executive power under presidents of both parties. The caucus is a rarity, a heartening political development: people giving priority to their legislative craft and institution rather than to a president of their party barking at them.

The House Freedom Caucus's 30-some members, and six others informally affiliated, are barely 8 percent of the House, but their cohesion is a force multiplier. The cohesion comes, Meadows says, from its members being “here for a purpose.” And, they add dryly, from the fact that, for many, “This is not the best job they've ever had.” Among the never-more-than 537 people who are in Washington because they won elections, none are more threatening to tranquility than the few who are not desperate to be here. They do not respond to the usual incentives for maintaining discipline.
The caucus has rules, bylaws and weekly meetings, often featuring experts on particular issues. House Freedom Caucus members have, Meadows believes, “a competitive advantage” in the House because they hone their arguments together in what Meadows call “the best debating club on Capitol Hill.” If 80 percent of the caucus agree on an issue, it votes as a bloc, although members can receive two exemptions per Congress.

I woke up early to go with a guide into the valley for sunrise. While waiting to go in, we had a beautiful twilight scene develop before us, with the awe-inspiring The Mittens rock formations before us. Seeing the beautiful twilight developing. I made a quick mosaic of 9 frames, equivalent to a large format image. The sun was still 15 degrees below the horizon, so it appeared quite dark with only a hint of blue twilight (astronomical twilight) enabling me to still see many stars. The bright "star" on the right is Venus, near Merrick Butte, and above left of the left Mitten is the Andromeda Galaxy, M31, which could be seen visually as a fuzzy patch. Cassiopea and the Double cluster appears on the left. To speed the acquisition, I moved and positioned each frame by hand. I completed the mosaic in 4.3 minutes and we made it to our first destination before sunrise. Twilight is one of the few times the night sky appears blue. The long exposure time picked up more detail and faint sunrise than could be seen with my eyes.
Technical. This image is a 9-frame mosaic. Canon 6D 20-megapixel digital camera, Sigma 35 mm f/1.4 DG HSM lens at f/1.4. Six exposures at ISO 1600 were made on the sky, each an 8-second exposure, fixed tripod. Three exposures at ISO 1600 were made on the land, each 30-second exposures. Full resolution image is 9828 x 6481 pixels (64 megapixels).
No dark frame subtraction, and no flat fields were used. The Canon 6D has the very low pattern noise, and on-sensor dark current suppression, so there is no need to do dark frames. Modern raw converters correct for hot pixels and, with lens profiles, correct for light fall-off, so there is no need for flat field corrections. Processing was done with 16-bits/channel.

Jimmy Chamberlin, the original drummer for the Smashing Pumpkins, is rejoining the band. He'll come along for their upcoming summer tour with Marilyn Manson, which kicks off in July. It's the first time he's played with the band since their 2009 exit.
“We're thrilled Jimmy's back in the saddle this summer to drive a super high-octane set, and it's nice to see the stars aligning around Smashing Pumpkins anew,” Billy Corgan said in a press release. They told USA Today, "Jimmy's drum parts are so incredibly technical and nuanced that it's a very rare class of people that can step in and play."
Chamberlin also spoke to USA Today about rejoining the band, which happened when a prior arrangement with another drummer fell through. "[Corgan] asked if there was any way I'd consider coming back for the tour," they said. "It's a great opportunity not only to celebrate the music, but to celebrate the friendship and the legacy."
Chamberlin said their commitment to the band only extends until the end of the tour, owing to their duties as CEO of LiveOne, a tech company involved with livestreaming concerts. The tour concludes in August.
The Smashing Pumpkins have been without a full-time drummer since Mike Byrne, who was enlisted to replace Chamberlin, departed the band last year. Mötley Crüe's Tommy Lee played on Monuments to an Elegy, while Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk played at a handful of shows. Corgan told USA Today that they expect the band's lineup to be interchangeable for the foreseeable future.

Korean Air executive vice president Cho Hyun-ah resigned from their position for causing inconvenience to passengers aboard a flight that was forced to return to the terminal on Cho's demands, the nation's No. 1 air carrier said Tuesday.
“I will step down to take responsibility over the incident,” Cho said in a statement. “I also beg the forgiveness of those who may have been hurt by my actions, and offer my apologies to our customers.”
Cho Yang-ho, their father and chairperson of Korean Air's operator Hanjin Group, immediately accepted the resignation, vowing that proper follow-up measures would be put in place.
Korean Air's Cho on Friday ordered the pilot of a Korean Air flight to deplane the chief flight attendant when they failed to locate guidelines in the service manual about serving nuts.
The executive vice president had been sitting in the first-class section when they were served a bag of macadamia nuts by a junior flight attendant who failed to ask them if they wanted them. They also reportedly complained about the nuts not being served on a plate and summoned the chief flight attendant to reprimand them about service protocol.
The plane, carrying some 250 passengers and bound for Incheon from New York's JFK Airport, had to go back to the terminal to drop off the flight manager.
Sensing the growing national uproar over the issue, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has launched an investigation into possible illegal misconduct on Cho's part.
“The ministry plans to take measures such as reporting the case to judicial authorities if it is suspected that (Cho) violated related aviation laws,” said Lee Chang-hee, director of the Transport Ministry's Aviation Security Division, adding that officials of the ministry's aviation security and safety divisions are jointly investigating.
On Tuesday, Korean Air's labor union released a statement calling for the company's management to take responsibility for the nut incident, instead of the deplaned flight attendant.
“The company is shifting its responsibility onto flight staff to conceal Cho's flaws,” the union said in the statement.
The company released an official statement late Monday night and apologized for the inconvenience caused to the passengers.
“It was inappropriate to turn the plane around despite it not being an emergency situation,” the carrier said in the statement.
The carrier maintained that the flight manager had neglected their duties by not being aware of whether or not it was suitable serve nuts to passengers without asking them first.

Alfreton Town chairperson Wayne Bradley fears the club will struggle to grow because of a lack of supporters.
The Conference Premier high-flyers would be able to play in the Football League despite concerns about the suitability of their Impact Arena home.
But while the ground has a capacity of more than 4,000, Bradley said their average league attendance of just 771 remains a cause for concern.
"Unless we can double our home support we will struggle to progress," they said.
It's fair to say that if we are promoted, within three years the current stadium would be unrecognisable Alfreton Town chairperson Wayne Bradley on planned ground developments
Talking to BBC Radio Derby, Bradley continued: "Support levels are definitely a concern - at the moment we are progressing almost despite ourselves.
"It's too easy for me to put blame at the supporters' door, but it's not the supporters that I'm complaining about - it's the stay-away individuals, it's the community at large.
"I do accept we trade in an area of football population, there is Derby County, Nottingham Forest and Chesterfield doing well, then there is Mansfield just on our doorstep in Nottinghamshire."
Alfreton, who have been deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player against Kidderminster in December, are just one place and one point outside the play-off places with five matches remaining.
Nicky Law's part-time side slipped out of the top five for the first time since mid-December following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Welling United - a match which attracted just 599 spectators.
Bradley said the club's ability to accommodate away support had been a major point of contention as they endeavoured to prove they meet the Football League's standards for promotion.
With little home support, however, Alfreton open more than half of their ground to visiting fans.
"When we showed them our current ground lay-out they quickly recognised that 50% is given over to away support," said Bradley.
"It is unique, it is a concern and it is a factor I consistently bang the drum about."
If promoted, Alfreton are capable of increasing the capacity of their ground to 5,200 with Bradley confirming they have three years of redevelopment works already planned out.
"It's fair to say that if we are promoted, within three years the current stadium would be unrecognisable," they said.
Torii Hunter is set to make one of baseball's best lineups even better.
FOXSports.com Ken Rosenthal reports via Twitter that the veteran outfielder has agreed to a two-year deal with the Detroit Tigers, pending a physical. The decision was confirmed by multiple national baseball writers, and USA Today's Bob Nightengale reports via Twitter that the deal is worth $26 million.
Hunter was one of the most coveted outfield free agents in this year's class. The 37-year-old spent the last five seasons with the Angels after playing their first 11 seasons with the Twins.
They hit .313 with 16 home runs and 92 RBIs last season for the Halos, and he's still a pretty solid defensive player, although not the all-world defender they were earlier in their career. He's also considered to be a tremendous clubhouse presence.
The Red Sox, who are likely looking to add a corner outfielder or two, were thought to have interest in Hunter, especially once David Ortiz — who is close friends with Hunter — re-signed with Boston.
Hunter signed a five-year, $90 million deal to join the Angels following the 2007 season.

New York, August 24, 2016 — Four days after winning the USA's first-ever Olympic gold medal in triathlon, Gwen Jorgensen will shift gears to begin training to make their marathon debut at the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon on Sunday, November 6, it was announced by New York Road Runners today.
“What a thrill it is to have Gwen join our amazing group of American professional athletes for the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon,“ said Peter Ciaccia, president of events for New York Road Runners and race director of the TCS New York City Marathon. “We have so much respect for what Gwen achieved in Rio and how well they represented the USA. Them gold medal proved once again that she's the world's top triathlete. Although Gwen crossed the iconic Central Park finish line once before – taking first place at the NYRR Dash to the Finish Line 5K the day before the 2014 TCS New York City Marathon – we are now excited to see them make the transition to long-distance road racing on the streets of New York City.”
Jorgensen, 30, of St. Paul, MN, is a two-time ITU world champion in their sport, who roared to victory at the Rio 2016 Games in a time of 1:56.16 on a highly technical course. They made their move on the Copacabana course during the bell lap of the run, leaving the defending Olympic champion Nicola Spirig of Switzerland behind after playing a game of cat-and-mouse.
The Olympic title was extra special for Jorgensen, who had packed up and moved to Australia and then Spain to train full-time after finishing 38th at the London 2012 Olympics because of a flat tire.
“This has been such an incredible year for me, and I thought what better way to continue to challenge myself than by running my first marathon,” said Jorgensen. “The triathlon will always be my first love, but I am really looking forward to the marathon and cannot think of a better place to make my debut than New York City.”
Jorgensen is a 17-time winner of the ITU World Triathlon Series races – having won all but two individual races since April 2014 – and was previously a standout runner as a member of the University of Wisconsin's cross-country and track and field teams. They were the 2009 Big Ten Conference champion in the 3000 meters and 5000 meters, and a three-time NCAA Championship participant in track and two-time participant in cross-country. Jorgensen is sponsored by ASICS, which has been a partner of the New York City Marathon for 25 years.
Jorgensen will join an American professional athlete field that also includes 10 men and 11 women who participated in the 2016 U.S. Olympic Team Marathon Trials and three other athletes who will be making their marathon debuts, including Olympic 5000-meter runner Kim Conley and NYRR Team for Kids Ambassador and Olympic 10,000-meter runner Molly Huddle, who broke the 10,000m American record at the Rio Olympics.
The 2016 TCS New York City Marathon will be televised live on Sunday, November 6, on WABC-TV, Channel 7 in the New York tristate area from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. ET, and for the rest of the nation on ESPN2 from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. ET.
About the TCS New York City Marathon
The TCS New York City Marathon is the premier event of New York Road Runners (NYRR) and the largest marathon in the world. Over 1,000,000 people have finished the race since its first running in 1970 with just 127 entrants and 55 finishers running four laps around Central Park. The race expanded to all five boroughs in 1976 and is now in its 40th year as a five-borough affair. Held annually on the first Sunday of November, the race features 50,000 runners including the world's top professional athletes and a vast range of competitive, recreational, and charity runners. Participants from over 125 countries tour the city, starting on Staten Island at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and running through the neighborhoods of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx before ending in Manhattan. In 2015, the inaugural NYRR Youth Invitational at the TCS New York City Marathon gave young runners the opportunity to run 1.8 miles of the race course in Central Park, beginning near mile 24 and finishing at the famed TCS New York City Marathon finish line. More than one million spectators and thousands of volunteers line the city streets in support of the runners, while millions more watch the live television broadcast in the New York area on WABC-TV, Channel 7, nationally on ESPN2, and via various international broadcast partners around the world. The race is part of the Abbott World Marathon Majors, which features the world's top marathons—Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago, and New York—and crowns the top professional male and female marathoners each year. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a leading global IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization, is the premier partner of NYRR and the title sponsor of the TCS New York City Marathon. The 46th running of the TCS New York City Marathon is set for November 6, 2016. To learn more, visit www.tcsnycmarathon.org.
MONTREAL — Compared with the rest of the N.H.L., the Canadiens do not score much, or shoot much, or control the puck much, which would seem to make it awfully difficult for them to win much — let alone 43 times, second most in the league — if not for a very important detail.
There is only one Carey Price, and they are theirs. The fans at Bell Centre thunder their name before the national anthem and during play and after games, even losses, paying homage to a goaltender compiling one of the finest seasons in years.
Price's performance has rendered reality indistinguishable from hyperbole, spoiling this city and its fabled team, blessed at the position by the likes of Jacques Plante, Ken Dryden and Patrick Roy, as almost never before.
After stopping 35 shots in a 3-1 victory against the Islanders on Saturday night, Price leads the league with a .936 save percentage and a 1.91 goals-against average. Only one other goalie has played to that standard across at least 50 appearances, according to Hockey-Reference.com: Dominik Hasek (.937, 1.87) in 1998-99. Hasek did not win the Hart Trophy, awarded to the league's most valuable player, but Price is considered the leading contender this year.
One nine-year-old boy said their father had been shot dead in front of them despite surrendering to Israeli soldiers with their hands in the air.
Another youngster described witnessing the deaths of their mother, three brothers and uncle after the house they were in was shelled.
They said their mother and one of their siblings had been killed instantly, while the others bled to death over a period of days.
A psychiatrist treating children in the village of Zeitoun on the outskirts of Gaza City, where the alleged incidents took place, described the deaths as a "massacre".
Israel has denied the claims, dismissing them as Hamas propaganda, but said that an investigation is being conducted into soldiers' conduct in the area.
In interviews with ITV News, Palestinians claimed that Israeli forces knowingly killed civilians in Zeitoun on the morning of Jan 14.
Abdullah Samouni, nine, described the moment their father was allegedly "executed" by Israeli soldiers.
Holding their arms in the air, they said: "He was surrendering like this. My father came out and they shot them right away."
A boy named Ahmed said they were trapped for days in the wreckage of the shelled Samouni family's house.
They said: "My mother was dead beside me, they were clutching my brother Nasser and they were dead. My brother Itzaq was bleeding for two days and then they died. My brother Izmael bled to death in one day. My uncle Talal was bleeding for two hours and they died. God bless them."
Dr Borno said: "It's a massacre. They collected them from their houses. They knew that they were civilians. They were children."
When asked if Hamas had been in Zeitoun, Dr Borno replied: "Suppose that there is one of the fighters around, what is it to do with all these? Is the price to kill the family as a whole? Is this baby carrying a machine gun?"
Israeli spokesperson Mark Regev suggested the claims could be Hamas propaganda and said an investigation was under way. However, they said that Israeli troops had reported that Zeitoun was "full of Hamas" militants and that soldiers encountered booby traps in "every house" in the village.
They said: "When people live in an authoritarian regime, when it's clear there is an official message and the message is to give out atrocity propaganda, [then] at least I think we should ask questions.
"Hamas has an interest in sending out this sort of atrocity propaganda.
"What happened in that village is under investigation. I know from speaking to IDF officers that there was very serious combat in that village, that every house was booby-trapped, there were guns. Very difficult military operation.
"If there is any Israeli solder that has done something inappropriate of course that will be discovered and there will be law, but I am very concerned about a situation where children are manipulated, where everyone is on the same message.
"We know that village was full of Hamas fighters. It's against the rules of engagement of the Israeli army to shoot innocent civilians."
Dubai: A French musician has been jailed for 15 days for playing their oud in public and collecting money, an act considered begging, a crime punishable by law.
The Dubai Misdemeanours Court convicted the 27-year-old French street entertainer of begging by spreading out a cloth in public for their audience to leave them money.
On November 1, Dubai Police apprehended the Frenchman for begging as they were caught playing their musical instrument while their audience listened to them at the Gold Souq in Naif.
The street entertainer was caught with Dh27 that their audience had left on a piece of cloth in front of him.
When they showed up before the presiding judge, the Frenchman admitted that they were playing their oud and had left a cloth in front of them for optional payment by the audience.
Street musicians and entertainers is a European-style of public performance and is common across most European and western cities.
The defendant claimed that street entertainment is their way of making a living. They contended that they travel the world and plays their oud in public and is paid by those who enjoy their music.
During questioning, they said they do not ask the audience to pay them but it is up to their discretion to leave them money in case they are entertained and like their music.
During Monday's hearing, the presiding judge presented the money that had been seized by the police and the accused confirmed that it was his.
They told the court that it was the money that their audience had left when they performed.
The court sentenced the Frenchman [who has been in custody since November 1] to 15 days in jail followed by deportation.
The presiding judge said the money will be confiscated.
Tuesday's ruling remains subject to appeal within 15 days.
Over 80 employees of the Shillong Raj Bhavan, from officers to peons, have sent a five-page letter to the Prime Minister's Office and to Rashtrapati Bhavan demanding the immediate removal of Meghalaya Governor V Shanmuganathan.

They have alleged that “his activities (have) hurt the decorum and prestige of the Raj Bhavan as well as sentiments of the Raj Bhavan employees.” The “activities,” as mentioned in the letter, include “seriously compromis(ing) the dignity” of Raj Bhavan, converting it into a “young ladies' club”, causing severe humiliation, mental stress and torture” to employees.

Shanmuganathan, 68, a veteran RSS activist from Tamil Nadu, joined as Governor on May 20, 2015, following which they were also given additional charge of Arunachal Pradesh from September 16, 2016 after JP Rajkhowa was removed. They were also in charge of Manipur from September 2015 to August 2016.

“The worst problem is that the Raj Bhavan has now under this Governor become a place where young ladies come and go at will with direct orders from the Governor. The security of the Governor's house is also being seriously compromised,” alleges the letter, a copy of which is with The Indian Express.
While Shanmuganathan is currently in Itanagar because they also hold additional charge of Arunachal Pradesh, they could not be contacted despite several attempts.

H M Shangpliang, secretary to the Governor, said Shanmuganathan had interacted with the Shillong Press Club through teleconferencing on Tuesday evening from Itanagar during which they denied the allegations already carried in The Highland Post on January 24. “You may use their quotes from other newspapers,” they said.
The Highland Post quoted an unnamed woman who had appeared for an interview in early December for a PRO's post at Raj Bhavan.
The newspaper quoted them as saying that the Governor allegedly made advances “by hugging and kissing her.” The newspaper quoted the Governor as denying the allegations and saying that woman employees of Raj Bhavan were like their “daughters and grand-daughters.”
The Shillong Times quoted the Governor as saying: “I wanted to meet them (the job aspirants) before finalising the candidates and they all came. Everyone was there for half an hour. I have got great respect for everyone. I have not done anything wrong.”

Denying allegations that they had made physical overtures or inappropriately complimented the woman, they were also reported as saying: “No it is not right. all these things are not right. We have selected only one person and some people were not selected and because they were not selected they should not say all these things.”

As President Donald Trump gets ready to “decertify” the Iran deal and continues to spar with “Little Rocket Man” over North Korea's missile program, the Norwegian Nobel Committee seems to be sending a not-so-subtle message about nuclear weapons. This year, the committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, or ICAN, a group advocating for nuclear disarmament.
In July, the Geneva-based NGO helped push for negotiations on a United Nations–backed nuclear-weapons prohibition treaty. A total of 122 countries backed the ban, though all nine nuclear powers, including the U.S., opposed the negotiations. At least 53 countries have signed on to the agreement since the formal ratification process opened at last month's General Assembly, reports the New York Times. It will go into effect if at least 50 countries ratify it within 90 days. Only three — Guyana, the Vatican, and Thailand — have completed that process so far.
“The organization is receiving the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its groundbreaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons,” the committee said in a statement about ICAN.
The committee appears to be responding to the tense geopolitical climate, particularly the escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear-weapons program. Nevertheless, the chairperson of the Norwegian Nobel Committee said they weren't trying to put Trump on notice. “We're not kicking anyone in the legs with this prize,” Berit Reiss-Andersen said.
Still, the judges' honoring of ICAN came as something of a surprise, especially since the front-runners included Pope Francis and the White Helmets, the volunteer first responders rescuing civilians in Syria. In fact, when ICAN first got the news that it had won the Peace Prize, its executive director thought it was a prank.
In this post, we will learn how to find the square root of numbers which are not perfect squares. The answer we get using this quick calculation technique gives us an approximate answer. However, approximation becomes a necessity when we are attempting questions in a competitive exam, where time is short and options are given. Most of the time we're not required to get exact answer.
Prerequisite to Use this Method
The prerequisite of using this method is you should remember the squares of as many numbers as possible. I would recommend that one should memorize square of numbers from 1 to 50. Later this can be extended t0 100.
It will be a wonderful idea to first learn the short cut method of finding the square of any number. Other awesome short cut method which you should consider knowing before moving forward is Herons method of finding roots.
Square Root of any number which is not a Perfect Square
Square Root = Sq. Root of The Nearest Perfect Square + {difference of the given number from the nearest perfect square / 2 x (Sq. Root of The Nearest Perfect Square)}
For example,
Short cut to find the Square Root of 47.
Square Root of 47
= 7 + (47-49) / 2 x 7 (since the perfect square closest to 47 is 49; we will take square root of 49 i.e. 7 for calculations)
= 7 – 2/2×7
=7 – 1/7
= 6.86 (approx).
The exact answer is 6.85565
Short cut to find the Square Root of 174
Square Root of 174
= 13 + (174-169) / 2 x 13 (since the perfect square closest to 174 is 169; we will take square root of 169 i.e. 13 for calculations)
= 13 + 5 / 26
= 13.19 (approx).
The exact answer is 13.1909
Short cut to find the Square Root of 650
Square Root of 650
= 25 + (650-625) / 2 x 25 (since the perfect square closest to 650 is 625; we will take square root of 625 i.e. 25 for calculations)
= 25 + 25/50
= 25.50 (approx).
The exact answer is 25.4950
This method has got a limitation. You can use it only till the point you remember the square
If you've questions related to the above shortcut method or anything else related to mathematics, please post on QM's Q & A platform. For anything else you can comment below.
Petition the Automotive Industry and Security Research Community to collaborate.
Five Star Automotive Cyber Safety Program (PDF Version)
Modern cars are computers on wheels and are increasingly connected and controlled by software. Dependence on technology in vehicles has grown faster than effective means to secure it. Security researchers have demonstrated vulnerability to accidents and adversaries over more than a decade. See timeline of automobile computer security research.
On August 8th, 2014 I Am The Cavalry published an open letter to the Automotive Industry. This letter urges carmakers to:
Acknowledge that vehicle safety issues can be caused by cybersecurity issues;
Embrace security researchers as willing allies to preserve safety and trust;
Attest to these five foundational capabilities to improve visibility of their Cyber Safety programs;
Initiate collaboration now to avert negative consequences in the future.
★ Safety by Design
Do you have a published attestation of your Secure Software Development Lifecycle, summarizing your design, development, and adversarial resilience testing programs for your products and your supply chain?
The public is informed and assured of your commitment to safety when you publish the extent to which you ensure that software is reasonably free of flaws. The goal is to convey confidence to the general public and to allow consumers to make informed choices among market alternatives. Software manufacturers, such as Microsoft and others, make this attestation and could serve as a model for automakers.
Key Elements:
Standard Based: Use of vetted ISO, NIST, or Industry standards would both accelerate an organization's maturity and ensure more predictable, normalized, comprehensive practices.
Use of vetted ISO, NIST, or Industry standards would both accelerate an organization's maturity and ensure more predictable, normalized, comprehensive practices. Supply Chain Rigor: Well-governed, traceable hardware & software supply chains enable more defensible products and more agile remediation times – especially amidst variable quality, security, and provenance.
Well-governed, traceable hardware & software supply chains enable more defensible products and more agile remediation times – especially amidst variable quality, security, and provenance. Reduction of Elective Attack Surface & Complexity: There are relationships between security and: complexity, interfaces, attack surfaces, code flaws per thousand lines of code, etc. As such, more secure designs seek to minimize these types of exposure.
There are relationships between security and: complexity, interfaces, attack surfaces, code flaws per thousand lines of code, etc. As such, more secure designs seek to minimize these types of exposure. Independent, Adversarial Resilience Testing: Adversarial testing should be carried out by qualified individuals, independent of those who designed and implemented the code. These individuals can be internal resources under a different organizational branch or third-parties.
★ Third Party Collaboration
Do you have a published Coordinated Disclosure policy inviting the assistance of third-party researchers acting in good faith?
A collaboration policy supports a positive, productive collaboration between the automotive industry and security researchers. Researchers are invited to contribute to automotive safety as willing allies to help discover and address flaws before adversaries and accidents can impact vehicle safety. Such coordinated exchanges are more positive, productive, and impactful than other alternatives. Your attestation serves as a commitment and a protocol for teaming.
Key Elements:
Standard Based: Use of vetted ISO standards for vendor side disclosure practice and for internal vulnerability handling (ISO 29147 and ISO 30111) accelerate an organization's maturity and ensure predictable, normalized interfaces to researchers and facilitators.
Use of vetted ISO standards for vendor side disclosure practice and for internal vulnerability handling (ISO 29147 and ISO 30111) accelerate an organization's maturity and ensure predictable, normalized interfaces to researchers and facilitators. Positive Incentives: Positive “Recognition & Reward” systems can further encourage and stimulate participation in bug reporting. Several prominent “Hackathon,” “Hall of Fame,” and “Bug Bounty” programs have proven successful and continue to drive iterative improvements. Exemplars can be provided.
Positive “Recognition & Reward” systems can further encourage and stimulate participation in bug reporting. Several prominent “Hackathon,” “Hall of Fame,” and “Bug Bounty” programs have proven successful and continue to drive iterative improvements. Exemplars can be provided. Known Interfaces: Independent vulnerability disclosure coordinators have normalized the interfaces between affected manufacturers and third-party researchers. These include non-profits organizations, bug bounty companies and government agencies. This too can support both greater efficiency and greater participation.
★ Evidence Capture
Do your vehicle systems provide tamper evident, forensically-sound logging and evidence capture to facilitate safety investigations?
Safety investigations drive substantial improvements, and records of electronic systems operations give visibility into root causes that may otherwise be opaque. These records can plainly show sources of error, be they malfunction, design defects, human error or deliberate attack. Those waiting for proof of hacking or electronic sabotage will not find evidence without such logging and evidence collection in place. This capability will require more effort, over time, than others on this list, but it is foundational for improving safety in the long-term so starting now will help us achieve this goal.
Key Elements:
Logging and Legal Standards: Lowest Common denominator syntax and verbosity would increase the value within a manufacturer and across the industry. Also, conforming to existing legal standards of care around cyber forensics would be prudent (e.g. for chain of evidence).
Lowest Common denominator syntax and verbosity would increase the value within a manufacturer and across the industry. Also, conforming to existing legal standards of care around cyber forensics would be prudent (e.g. for chain of evidence). Improve effectiveness of NHTSA: The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigates automobile safety issues. In the absence of a “black box” capability as in airplanes, these investigations lack full visibility into potential causes of safety issues. Collecting and retaining data as recommended will facilitate their investigations and improve their ability to perform causal analyses.
Collecting and retaining data as recommended will facilitate their investigations and improve their ability to perform causal analyses. Privacy Sensitivity: The universal benefits/subset of features of a “black box” as outlined here can meet its intended functions without requiring privacy and surveillance infractions of citizens across the complexities of various states/countries/jurisdictions. Debates over the capture of data like GPS movement tracking or other recordings of citizens can be decoupled from safety to avoid unnecessary entanglement.
★ Security Updates
Can your vehicles be securely updated in a prompt and agile manner?
Security and functionality flaws require the ability to be remediated in a prompt, reliable, secure manner. If emergent security issues cannot be remediated quickly and easily, the window of exposure is increased and the cost of recall, repair, and restitution will grow significantly. The recent HeartBleed flaw put hundreds of thousands of devices at risk. Without the ability to update software in the field, similar flaws in automobiles would require carmakers to undertake a costly factory recall or accept the associated consequences of perpetual, critical security issues.
Key Elements:
Secure Updating System: While updating is a necessary capability, an insecure update design could facilitate adversaries or trigger accidents. Authenticity and quality verification preserves the integrity of the updates and leads to a safer mechanism that can prevent digital tampering or unexpected failures.
While updating is a necessary capability, an insecure update design could facilitate adversaries or trigger accidents. Authenticity and quality verification preserves the integrity of the updates and leads to a safer mechanism that can prevent digital tampering or unexpected failures. Service Level Agreements (SLA): While it is critical to be able to update a vulnerable system, valuable aspects like Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) will vary amongst manufacturers. Those who commit to a faster delivery and/or a higher standard of quality will better ensure safety.
While it is critical to be able to update a vulnerable system, valuable aspects like Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) will vary amongst manufacturers. Those who commit to a faster delivery and/or a higher standard of quality will better ensure safety. Robust Notification/Communication: Public communication should be transparent and forthright. Decades of experience in the software industry have taught that the best way to ensure security and safety are: notification of when and where flaws exist, their severity, contents of the update, and clear instructions.
★ Segmentation and Isolation
Do you have a published attestation of the physical and logical isolation measures you have implemented to separate critical systems from non-critical systems?
If systems share the same memory, computing, and/or circuitry (as most current generation cars do), these systems allow for loss of life and limb. Such risks are entirely avoidable and merit a higher standard of care. For instance, a malicious InfoTainment application or a compromise over Bluetooth or wireless should never have the ability to take control over critical functions such as disabling the brakes, deploying airbags, or turning the steering wheel. Hacking the InfoTainment system should never cause an accident.
Key Elements:
“Air Gaps”: Physical separation is the only way to ensure that non-critical systems can not adversely impact primary, operational, and safety systems (e.g. Hacking the stereo can never cause a crash). While some manufacturers are planning, discussing, or implementing logical isolation techniques, methods to circumvent these measures are routinely discovered and demonstrated.

While some manufacturers are planning, discussing, or implementing logical isolation techniques, methods to circumvent these measures are routinely discovered and demonstrated. System Integrity/Recovery: Techniques exist to indicate when a system has been compromised. Earlier detection can reduce the total duration and extent of the compromise as well as catalyze remediation. In some cases, a “fail safe” or “safe mode” can be an automatic fallback safety mechanism. Any choices should be scrutinized with experienced adversary/threat analysis as they may introduce new attack or denial of service opportunities.

Any choices should be scrutinized with experienced adversary/threat analysis as they may introduce new attack or denial of service opportunities. Enhanced Assurance: Given the potential for harm, a higher rigor and level of assurance is merited. Third-party review and validation of architecture, implementation, and adversary resilience testing can raise confidence. Similarly, Operating System choices such as Mandatory Access Control (MAC) architectures reduce risk. “Formal Methods” of engineering and more secure protocols merit consideration. Evaluation examples may be instructive (e.g. “Common Criteria EAL 5+”).

At Sony's press event at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Activision showed off its hands-on combat for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Fans have been skeptical that the sci-fi space combat would work, but Activision's Infinity Ward studio showed that it could create combat scenes that feel like a part of the Call of Duty series, which has led to more than $15 billion in sales over more than a decade.
In the battle that Activision showed, you are in Geneva, Switzerland, after a massive attack on earth by the Settlement Defense Front. You move through a ruined town and start fighting as you climb a hill. You have to shoot your way up the hill, using methods like hacking to take over enemy gunships or calling in air strikes. Then the demo shows you getting in a fighter and taking off into space. You engage in aerial dogfights and play for as long as you like. Afterward, you land on a giant ship and jump out into zero gravity. At that point, you have to jump from spot to spot and use your grappling hook to either pull enemies close to you for melee kills or shoot them from afar. Once you board the ship, the combat returns to a familiar Call of Duty firefight. It's an intense and epic scene.
Giancarlo Valdes and I caught up with Jacob Minkoff and Chad Findley from the Infinity Ward team to talk about the demo. Here's an edited transcript of our interview.

GamesBeat: You said there are assists in the dogfighting part. How does that work?
Chad Findley: You have full control throughout the entire thing as you're flying around, but if you lock on to an enemy, the computer system of your Jackal helps you to stay behind them. We can do these really cool flights right by big ships, or threading the needle between things in ground missions. It's super fun.
GamesBeat: What would you say is the balance between these ground missions and space missions?
Findley: It's kind of all over. It's whatever works best for the story we're telling and the pacing we want to maintain. We have a main story that takes you from earth, up into space, to some other planets and moons. You might come back to earth at some point. Then you have these side missions that are all about these large capital ships you have to take out. Those have a lot of variety to them as far as the amount of dogfighting you have and the amount of fighting inside the ships and so on.
GamesBeat: Is there a difference between ground combat and zero G? Just puncturing somebody's suit, shouldn't that kill them?
Image Credit: Activision
Findley: These are self-sealing suits. They've thought of that. [Laughs] You still have to kill them. But you can do some one-shot kills with things like helmet cracks.
Jacob Minkoff: You can use your grapple both as a navigation tool and also as a “get over here” grab action.
GamesBeat: What's the benefit of doing side missions?
Minkoff: You get both narrative and mechanical benefits. Side missions give you additional weaponry, equipment upgrades, cosmetic upgrades, general progression stuff. They also get you enemy intel that helps you target enemy forces better. There's more world building, too. Some of the missions are more stealthy, where you'll go behind enemy lines and hear their commanders talking about their plans. Those are very intense. You overhear a lot of conversations.
Side missions involve spending more time with your crew as well. It fleshes out the story and the characters while also providing mechanical rewards.
Findley: Some of the things you can get, energy weapons for instance, are much better against robots. A lot of the energy weapons are found on these side missions. If you want the energy shotgun or energy sniper, that's where you can get those.
GamesBeat: How do you do the hacking?
Findley: You paint the target and then release the button.
GamesBeat: So, as soon as they get painted, or….
Findley: Yeah, when you see the square brackets show up, as soon as you see a diamond shape, that means you have a lock on. Then you release at that point. All these mechanics get tutorialized beforehand. We didn't want to make the audience sit through that when you could get right into the action.
Image Credit: Activision
GamesBeat: Are the helmets different? How do you tell the enemies from friendlies?
Findley: The helmets are different and so is the general silhouette shape.
GamesBeat: You've done ground combat in all of your games before, but the spaceships are new. Did you look at any past games for inspiration on how to tackle that?
Findley: We looked at everything we could. We looked at games. We looked at real fighter aircraft, the way they work. We looked at current-day ship designs. The thing we really wanted to do is have parity with the precision and the controllability with our ground stuff. The ground combat feels great. We wanted the space stuff to feel just as good. We went through two years of iteration on that control system.
GamesBeat: Flying the ship seems like an extension of the on-ground Call of Duty controls.
Minkoff: In atmosphere, you need to lift to keep going forward. That's why you get that Top Gun ace feeling of constantly moving forward. But in space, in a vacuum, you have [reaction control system (RCS)] thrusters. Because you don't have to worry about losing lift, you basically have strafe controls.
What we did with the Jackal — whenever you're pressing forward, you have Top Gun-style flight controls. But the moment you pull back and brake, then you have RCS controls. You can just strafe up and down or left and right. It's full parity with what you can do on the ground. Sprint becomes boost. Crouch becomes down. Jump is up. You're circle-strafing around that destroyer. The slower the enemy is — those destroyers move slowly compared to the Skeletons, which are fast — that inherently makes you use one control scheme or another.

GamesBeat: In space, it would seem like you need to invert the controls if you're used to pulling back on a flight yoke. But it looks like that is not necessary. Is the speed still the same, 60 frames per second?
Findley: Yeah, we always shoot for 60 frames per second, every time.
Minkoff: The big challenge here is, how do you make something that looks awesome, that has a new lighting system with physically based rendering and lit particles and all these things we're doing to look next gen but still do it at 60? That's been a huge engineering task, but our team has done a really good job.
GamesBeat: Is the announcement of things like Project Scorpio and other upgraded hardware kind of relief to you guys?
Minkoff: I think everyone's still focusing on [PlayStation 4] and Xbox One. We're doing PC as well. But no matter what, we have to make the current platforms run it at a full 60.
GamesBeat: What are some things we should be looking out for in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered? I thought Soap's face looked very good, better than the old one would have been.
Findley: We redid so much of the game.
Minkoff: If you do side-by-side screenshots on that — we've released some stuff from the press conference, and I'm sure people out there are doing comparisons. Everything is rebuilt. New characters, new environments, new visual effects, new lighting engine — everything is completely rebuilt. If you look at them side by side, it'll blow your mind. It's not just an HD up-res. It's a rebuild.
Bradley Manning's defense rests its case
By Matthew MacEgan
12 July 2013
On Wednesday, the defense rested its case in the court-martial of Bradley Manning, the US Army private who has pleaded guilty to releasing 700,000 documents exposing the crimes of US imperialism to the WikiLeaks website in April 2010.
The trial, which began June 3, has laid bare the fiercely anti-democratic character of the Obama administration, which came to power promising transparency and openness, yet has indicted more individuals for espionage (i.e., exposing government and military misdeeds) than all previous US administrations combined. The political and military establishment is now seeking to make an example of Manning to intimidate any who would follow in their courageous footsteps.
Manning is being tried for political acts in a court-martial before a military judge with almost unlimited powers. Moreover, military judge Colonel Denise Lind ruled that Manning's political motives were irrelevant to the case and could not be considered, making the proceeding a travesty of fairness and justice.
In a 35-page pre-trial statement, Manning made clear the political nature of their actions. They noted, “In attempting to conduct counter-terrorism … and counter-insurgency (COIN) operations, we became obsessed with capturing and killing human targets on lists … and ignoring the second- and third-order effects of accomplishing short-term goals and missions.
“I believe that if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information … this could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general … as it related to Iraq and Afghanistan.
“I also believed the detailed analysis of the data over a long period of time by different sectors of society might cause society to reevaluate the need or even the desire to even to engage in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations that ignore the complex dynamics of the people living in the effected environment every day.”
Later in their statement, Manning explained, “The more I read, the more I was fascinated by the way that we dealt with other nations and organizations. I also began to think that the documented backdoor deals and seemingly criminal activity didn't seem characteristic of the de facto leader of the free world.”
Manning felt particularly strongly about this question of secret diplomacy, a central feature of the diplomatic cables released to WikiLeaks: “The more I read the cables, the more I came to the conclusion that this was the type of information that should become public.” They noted that they had read about the issue of open diplomacy in regard to the First World War, and asserted that “the world would be a better place if states would avoid making secret pacts and deals with and against each other.”
However, rather than utilizing the trial to further expose the crimes of the US government made public through Manning's actions, the defense, headed by military defense counsel David Coombs, has conceded that Manning is guilty of the release of classified information and has only sought to fight against the claim that their revelations aided enemies such as Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
In February, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 lesser charges, including unauthorized possession, willful communication and improper storage of classified material, for which they face a 20-year sentence. However, they have pleaded not guilty to violating the Espionage and Computer Fraud and Abuse acts, which could bring them a life sentence. They have also pleaded not guilty to larceny, aiding the enemy and improper use of government information systems.
Largely disregarding Manning's sincere political convictions and concerns, Coombs has chosen to portray their client as an inept and malcontented individual.
However, a number of defense witnesses, including Manning's supervisors during their time in Iraq, paint a much different picture of the young man.
Army Chief Warrant Officer Joshua Ehresman, who supervised Manning near Baghdad, stated that they “was our best analyst by far… They would come up with exactly what you were looking for. They were our go-to guy.” They also stated that Manning's intelligence reports were “very detailed” and that they had the highest production level in their unit.
Another witness, also a friend of Manning's, Lauren McNamara, provided insight into the political factors motivating him. Providing several months of chat conversations between themselves and Manning, they explained that Manning was very upset and troubled by the way civilians were treated in Iraq during their stay. “He considered human life to be valuable above all,” they explained, stating that they “put people first.”
Over the course of their exchange, Manning revealed to McNamara their desire to go into politics with the goal of saving families in other countries and ensuring that noncombatants were able to get home safely.
While the prosecution utilized 80 witnesses over a five-week period, the defense only presented ten in defense of Manning over the course of one week.
Coombs sought to show that while Manning did reveal classified information, it did no harm to national security. Defense witness Colonel Morris Davis, former chief military prosecutor at Guantánamo, commented in an interview with Democracy Now! that Manning “ought to get a reasonable sentence for what he's admitted that they did.” The only bone of contention, according to such figures, is whether Manning intended to aid, or did aid, terrorist groups like Al Qaeda.
Dear Fans,
First of all I would like to say sorry. Sorry for letting down your expectations. Some of you had high hopes for this game and maybe wanted to see it among the best survival games out there. But we all failed you. I failed you.
When we first started working on this game we were kids and had no idea on the difficulties of making a game. The guy who started the game was 14 years old. But we thought, hey, everyone great had to start from somewhere even if they were young and stupid first. Start small, then build on it, attract some investment, hire more people, do more work, attract more investment, and on and on until release.
We had serious discussions with a big investor, and we thought we had our launch pad. But the negotiations fell apart. Some was our fault, some was the investor. Anyway we failed to secure funding. The negotiations were long and exhausting and ended up nowhere. At that moment we thought there were no shortage of investors out there, and we still had the work we've done so far. We could go on working and research other ways or funding.
But then some of our people started leaving. They thought this game was going nowhere. There were debates among us. Some said that the game mechanics were wrong and it wouldn't be fun, others said that the work so far was too low quality compared to the competition, others that we were too ambitious from the start and we overreached. The work stalled. We were no longer making any progress. Time passed and more people left.
And I am the last one on the team. The people who started this game have long ago moved on to other projects. I haven't done any work on this game for more than two years. I am ashamed of it. But I couldn't go on by myself.
I started working by myself on a new game called War Legacy. It's a multiplayer free to play shooter with firearms from all the historical ages. It's far less ambitious than Survivor and I believe I've learned my lesson. I will not repeat the mistakes I've made with Survivor. Others have recently joined me and we are now a full team. A small one but united. They all know about Survivor. They know the story. We have a new investor, much smaller one, who is interested in our game and thinks it has great potential.
In the end, it pains me to say it but Survivor is dead. It is dead for two years and I couldn't gather the courage to come forward to you and admit it. But there it is. I invested some years of my life in it and stayed with it much longer than anyone else. But everyone has to move on, including me.
If you want to see this game I've been working on this time here it is on Steam Greenlight

Best wishes to all of you,

Anti-Ukip Protestors have hounded Nigel Farage, their wife and their two young daughters from a pub near their home in Kent whilst the family was enjoying a Sunday lunch.
The two girls, aged just ten and fifteen, fled in terror and were missing for some time this afternoon before returning home. Mr Farage has labelled the crowd “scum”.
The crowd of between 60 and 100 activists first turned up at the George and Dragon where Mr Farage has previously been spotted having a pint. When they heard that they were actually at the nearby Queen's Head in Downe, Kent, they relocated, mobbing the family as they were enjoying a quiet Sunday lunch.
They chased the family from the pub, jumping on the bonnet of Mr Farage's car as they drove away. The self styled “cabaret of diversity” was said by organiser Dan Glass to comprise of migrants, HIV activists, gay people, disabled people and breastfeeding mums, all of whom claimed to have been “targetted by Ukip.”
Glass told the Independent “Ukip are a con. They pretend to be anti-establishment but this couldn't be further from the truth. By wrongfully shifting the blame for the economic crisis on to immigrants they have let the bankers off the hook. We will not succumb to their prejudice. We will create the world we want to live in. A world beyond Ukip.”
But Mr Farage reacted angrily, saying “I hope these ‘demonstrators' are proud of themselves. My children were so scared by their behaviour that they ran away to hide. At the time of writing this a relative has gone to look for them, and they are not yet at home. These people are scum.”
Mr Glass said “We didn't see any kids.”
Left wingers have reacted with delight. Mike Kear, a freelance photographer who was in attendance said it seemed “very calm”, describing the event as day of celebration”.
“It was very good-natured – there was certainly nothing very intimidating about it,” they said.
Mike Kear, a freelance photographer attending the protest, said it seemed “very calm” inside the pub throughout and described the demonstration as “a day of celebration”.
“It was very good-natured – there was certainly nothing very intimidating about it,” they said.
Occupy London was also present, tweeting a number of images from the pub depicting “Roma solidarity” and a “beyond Ukip celebration”

But others recognised a more sinister element to the anti-democratic protest.
Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan tweeted “A gang chases away two girls in pursuit of “tolerance”? I'd have used a stronger word.”
Nigel Farage has a point. A gang chases away two girls in pursuit of “tolerance”? I'd have used a stronger word. @Independent @Nigel_Farage — Daniel Hannan (@DanHannanMEP) March 22, 2015
Douglas Carswell, Ukip's first elected MP questioned whether the recent slew of anti-Ukip programmes on television over the last few weeks had created a false impression that mobbing the Ukip leader was ok.
Appalling behaviour by the anti-UKIP extremists attacking Nigel Farage's family. Perhaps Ch 4 et al anti-UKIP output makes them think it ok? — Douglas Carswell (@DouglasCarswell) March 22, 2015
And Mark Littlewood, director of the Institute for Economic Affairs and a former Liberal Democrat press officer, said “hard to disagree with Farage's description of the “protestors” as scum”
Hard to disagree with @Nigel_Farage‘s description of those who “protested” at their family lunch as “scum”. Also idiots. Counter-productive. — Mark Littlewood (@MarkJLittlewood) March 22, 2015
Nigel later thanked those who were offering support and reassured Ukip voters that they would not be silenced.
Steve Wynn, the casino magnate who plans to build a $2 billion casino in Everett, was characteristically blunt when speaking about their company's business strategy in a meeting with investors on Thursday.
According to a transcript of the call by Seeking Alpha, Wynn said their company “caters to the top-end” of the gaming world, like a “Chanel” or “Louis Vuitton.”
“But unlike Chanel and Louis Vuitton, we are able in our business to cater to all of the market by making our standard so high that everybody wants to in the building,” they said. “Or to put it in a more colloquial way, rich people only like being around rich people. Nobody likes being around poor people, especially poor people.”

“So we try and make the place feel upscale for everyone,” they continued. “That is to say, we cater [to] the people who have discretion and judgment and give them a choice.”
In a statement Friday, Wynn Resorts spokesperson Michael Weaver said the comment was “made in the context of a discussion that the company creates luxurious resorts which have an aspirational appeal to a broad range of guests.”
Wynn, who is known for their candid conference calls, also admitted that they didn't know where Everett was until they got on the phone with Mayor Carlo DeMaria, Jr., who “was dying to have us come,” they said.
“We walk around those 30 acres and it needs work,” Wynn said. “But the mayor was so enthusiastic and persuasive we started the process, and you know the outcome.”
Everett's median household income is $51,000, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, compared to the state-wide median household income of about $68,000.
In an interview Friday, DeMaria forcefully defended Wynn, saying the statement had been misinterpreted. DeMaria said they interpreted the mogul as saying they intend to build a facility that will be attractive to people of all classes.
“What he's saying is, it's all about the experience,” DeMaria said. “We want to be somewhere that's as nice as it can be. At their facilities, you can get a hamburger for $10 and a steak for $200.”

DeMaria said they did not believe Wynn should apologize for the comments.
The mayor refused to say whether Wynn had put their foot in their mouth. “I really don't want to comment on that,” they said. “He's a very intelligent and intellectual person. He's dealing with probably a lot of stress. … There are lots of things going on in Boston that they didn't expect to happen.”
“If I'm a poor person, I'm not insulted by their comments,” DeMaria added. “He employs tens of thousands of people. … We're all poor out here. I myself as mayor, I'm check to check.”
Since being awarded the region's only casino license, Wynn has battled Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone over traffic and environmental concerns. The plans to build a casino are currently on hold after because of a legal challenge from the city of Somerville over an environmental permit.
The plans feature a 2,000-pound statue of Popeye the Sailor Man made by famed artist Jeff Koons, which Wynn bought for $28 million.
Google's chief release engineer Jean-Baptiste Queru just announced via the Android Building group that version 4.1.2 of Android is being released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) today.
The release follows Android 4.1.1, which was the final version of Jelly Bean, and is marked as minor. The build number, which we spotted in the logs yesterday, is JZO54K, while the AOSP tags are android-4.1.2_r1 and jb-mr0-release.
It's also a good time to bring up the fact that the LG Nexus prototype that we saw yesterday was also running 4.1.2. Today's announcement seems to add further credibility to that story.
Update #1: 4.1.2 has already started rolling out to the Nexus 7, though mine doesn't see it yet.
Update #2: Since I mentioned seeing 4.1.2 with this very build number in the server logs, I'll throw in the devices that I saw running it, in addition to the Nexus 7 (this doesn't mean the updates for them are out now, but rather a good indication of what's to come):
Nexus S (though with JZO54H)
Galaxy Nexus
Xoom
Update #3: Per the update notification on the Nexus 7, Android 4.1.2 "improves performance and stability and fixes bugs." Not too helpful, but it's a start.
Update #4: Looks like we finally have launcher landscape mode on the Nexus 7!
Update #5: Flash 4.1.2 on the Nexus 7 manually if you haven't gotten your update yet.
Update #6: Issue 34212: On Jelly Bean, failed to connect to WPA enterprise wireless is fixed in 4.1.2.
Images via EETimes
We're releasing Android 4.1.2 to AOSP today, which is a minor update
on top of 4.1.1. As a note to maintainers of community builds running on Nexus 7: please update to 4.1.2 at the first opportunity. Future variants of the grouper hardware will have a minor change in one of the components (the power management chip) that will not be compatible with 4.1.1. The build number is JZO54K, and the tag is android-4.1.2_r1. Enjoy,
Conley and JBQ --

Blockchain investor Travis Scher of Digital Currency Group has posted a querulous smack-down of Initial Coin Offering (ICOs) going on in the cryptocurrency world that support, for a large part, Blockchain startups. And this piece is a counterweight, a rebuttal – a retort of sorts.
advertisement
To date, there are estimates that one quarter ($250 million) of all investment in Blockchain ($1 billion) has been conducted in this nascent sector, which has been turning heads in not only the deal flow streams of the Blockchain investment crowds but also the more traditional investment community.
Scher writes:
“I believe that ICOs and Appcoins are, broadly speaking, not an attractive investment nor are they likely to become one in the near-term.”
He's adamantly stating that cryptofinancing is not attractive to Venture Capitalists (VC) and he's right.
It's too disruptive for their own business model which was already taken over by crowdfunding in 2016.
“And in my diligence, I've repeatedly encountered four issues that make investing in new tokens— at least for now —very unappealing compared to traditional VC investing: 1) regulatory uncertainty, 2) high valuations/over-capitalization, 3) lack of controls, and 4) lack of business use cases,” they add.
Let's address these points.
1. Regulatory uncertainty is what allows anyone from anywhere who wants to make the choice to invest, the ability to do so without being told they are unaccredited (not wealthy enough to play). Regulatory uncertainty allows for the ICOs to move at pace of innovation that is not tied to pencil pushers lobbied by big interest groups to create laws that inhibit or even snuff out the ecosystem. Governments are national – this place is global. SEC is moot for the most part as US investors are doing so with pseudonymity using Bitcoin which is not even considered money by the US government but rather a capital asset.
I would argue that the ICO community potentially does far better due diligence on itself and much better than any junior hire at an investment bank or VC – any shiny FINRA-licensed kid with an MBA – tasked to dig into something they know little about.
In the crypto-hangouts – particular at Bitcointalk where almost all ICOs are first broadcast, scores of net-savvy investors start googling the history of the founders and teams, ripping apart the code, hammering the theory, and generally kicking the living shit out of the concept – by the tens. Then they out scammers who end up shrivelling out the forum with their tails tucked and hang the ICO. You also have new companies like Smith and Crown doing great work analysing ICOs and others are now moving into that space and providing more centralised market intelligence.
In terms of ‘breaking the law' when it comes to spending your own money as you see fit in an investment you feel you can handle – Obama has finally opened the doors slightly with the JOBS act and you don't have to be an accredited investor or bike to work on Sand Hill Road to reap rewards any longer. And so it should be. The Americans are already three years behind the UK and Netherlands in crowdfinancing. ICOs are, in particular, have been a panacea to American investors (particularly those with a lot of unclaimed cryptocurrency) who want to participate.
2. High valuations/over-capitalization – If Scher wants to talk about high valuations and over capitalisation, let's talk about the “growth at all costs” unicorns created by the VC community – manifested by the Sand Hill insiders that has made them and a few startup founders unbelievably wealthy while ‘unaccredited' investors – or people on the outside – watch from the sidelines, hoping they might get some scrapings on the secondary market if they are lucky.
In 2015, according to the Guardian:
“…there were 82 $1bn pre-IPO startups in the US and a total of 125 worldwide and the combined valuation of all US unicorns was $486bn – more than the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of Austria, Colombia or South Africa – and not one has made any profit, as they are all concentrated on aggressively spending to expand their reach and thereby increase their valuation before floatation.”
And who wants to sit around for a year, piddling around with petty cash from an accelerator and listening to nicely intentioned' but unpaid mentors blather about lean methodology – when an ICO can raise enough money to hire people to get it right. Blockchain developers are rarer than Pandas, and are some of the highest paid engineers in NYC with some demanding over a quarter million USD a year. This is not creating the next viral app using clever Javascript or Ruby on Rails, this is serious new science they have not even begun to teach in universities yet. It's not cheap.
Scher writes:
“Founders with ideas that would struggle to raise a $500k seed round from experienced venture capital funds.”
‘ Boohoo, they are raising too much money and it's just NOT RIGHT because we think it's overvalued' is not really a substantive argument. Especially in a nascent sector such as Blockchain where everything and anything is highly speculative because few know where it's going at this point – we are at the 1992 stage of the Internet here with Blockchain.
Look at it this way – eight out of ten funded startups in your world still fail at the end of the day so it's still hit and miss no matter where you invest. VC knows this and they also play the numbers game. That's why Fail Early Fail Fast is a mantra in the Valley.
“The only buyers in these token sales seem to be overly-enthusiastic early Bitcoin and Ether holders who feel like they are playing with house money, and have no basis for determining the value of these project or how much money they will need,” added Scher.
They are playing with house money. Great! What else should they do with it? They were smart enough to invest at the right time in the right cryptocurrencies and have done well. They are largely, net savvy, young libertarians or engineers and technologists who built the systems. The idea that any VC has more ability to determine the value of a highly complex Blockchain project then the actual community who worships Satoshi Nakamoto, has deep understanding of the concepts, and crowdsources intelligence is highly laughable.
3. Lack of controls sounds like VC-inese for not having a boot to your neck (control) which is not considered by many entrepreneurs to be an incentive – why do you think there are so many bootstrappers these days? “Growth at all costs” is a misnomer of a VC mantra which really means, dilute them down and shut them the fuck up while we pump up the stock and get ready for the IPO. I am not sure what lack of controls means. We already covered the regulatory side.
4. Lack of business use cases – this is probably the most ridiculous point. Many of the projects are open source – you know that niggly' little issue that most VC run from because they are bent on proprietary IP and ownership models? Yes… we finally have a model for open source software and hardware projects to get funded instead of getting kicked to the curb by most traditional investors. Secondly there are plenty of great business models.
DECENT.ch has set up a foundation in Switzerland and are open sourcing all their software. They will not only have SDKs and APIs, the entire codebase will be open. They are not greedy. They are ethical guys and have earned respect in the Crypto community. They raised over $4 million in their ICO after being vetted by the community. And they plan to build solutions for the content industry – for video in particular – and already have announced trials with content producers for next year. They plan to open it all up for third party developers to build on and create even more businesses. Their roots are in the freedom of speech movement which falls nicely with the ethos of the community. They will likely earn money by cutting deals with content producers, by offering paid for enterprise versions of their OS software (like Magento does) and maybe even build the next Steem.
Another project is InChain, who are doing an ICO to raise funds for insurance against hacking exchanges in the cryptocommunity, so the next time an Mt. Gox happens, people can recover and not get wiped out. This kind of Blockchain innovation in the insurance industry, funded by traditional means, is going to take years to get past all the regulation, red tape, industry kickback, reticence from traditional investors etc. InChain plan it to not just have a PoC or prototype to show the traditional insurance industry, but a working product in 2017.
And seeing you dissed gambling in your article – Blockchain gambling startup vDice has a working product for their upcoming ICO, is founded by a founding core developer of Ethereum and has had their code audited by legend Peter Vessenes, former Former CEO of CoinLab, Inc and Co-Founder / Chairman Emeritus of the Bitcoin Foundation. It's going to make a lot of money – and the Chinese cryptocurrency community is expected to invest heavily in this one. It's a great business case.
Yes, it is the Wild West, and the way I see it, there's quite a lot of Bitcoin and Ether profit floating around that is getting pumped into these projects so really VC is not needed. Sure some VCs seem to think it's monopoly money in the way people are earning it speculating… but it's when it's convertible to Fiat currencies, it's very real.
Many of the speculators who are making a killing on the cryptocurrency exchanges are either sitting on it or playing the exchanges. And ironically, Bitcoin is not as decentralised as the Bitcoin Maximalists love to chant – half of all Bitcoins are in the hands of less than 1000 people and that's a $10 billion market cap. They are called Bitcoin whales. And they are the ones manning the pumps for a large part of the $250 million invested via ICOs over the past year.
These new startups constructing on cryptocurrency are not perfect, there's a lot of trial and error going on – a lot of experimentation, some huge fails and some big wins. But how different is it all really from the normal startup world?
This whole space is still very young in itself and there are a lot of lessons to be learnt and people will feel or get burnt all over the place. I don't doubt that.
Some think it's a bubble waiting to burst, but that's rather unlikely – people have been saying that about Bitcoin since day one. And if any bubble bursts it's going to be the Unicorn one – who hide ‘not profitable' behind ‘growth strategy'. And are largely based on centralisation tactics which will likely be disrupted in the next waves of Blockchain-driven dencentralisation products.
Blockchain, many think, can potentially alter the way we organise ourselves as people, communities and nations. We just don't know exactly how yet, there are still more algorithms to be written, more math to be crunched, and a lot more people much smarter than me working on it to get there. And it's not only about Blockchain, it's also about the future of Open Source software, which often does not provide numbers investors like to see but is essential in the progression of innovation itself. But it also takes money – and if all these profits being churned out of cryptocurrency can play a part in developing Blockchain faster and better then why not?
It may not be VC money but who cares… don't invest in it, if you don't want to. But don't completely write it off.

Consumer advocates have asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to declare that AT&T violated a privacy rule in the Communications Act by selling phone records to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
A report last month said that "AT&T has turned over international calling records to the CIA. The telecom charges the CIA more than $10 million per year in exchange for access to metadata about calls by suspected terrorists overseas."
In response, a group of consumer advocacy groups led by Public Knowledge filed a petition today with the FCC.
Appealing to the FCC is a new tactic against government collection of calling records. Previously, privacy advocates have tried to shut down the phone collection by filing lawsuits, including one in the Supreme Court.
"We filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling at the FCC asking it to declare that the types of records AT&T is reportedly selling to the government are protected under Section 222," a part of the Communications Act that "tells carriers that with few exceptions, they have to get customers' consent before they can share 'customer proprietary network information,' or 'CPNI,'" Public Knowledge Staff Attorney Laura Moy wrote in a blog post.
Public Knowledge's petition calls out AT&T as being "in Violation of Section 222 because it sells individually identifiable call records to the CIA, Companies, and Other Entities Without Customers' Consent." And unsurprisingly, the practice may not be limited to AT&T.
"[T]he sale of CPNI to the government isn't our only concern—when we did a little more poking around, we found that all four major mobile carriers (AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon) have privacy policies that indicate they believe it is OK to sell or share similar records to anyone," Moy wrote. "We don't know whether or not they actually are selling CPNI, but the fact that they think they can is alarming."
We've contacted the FCC, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint about Public Knowledge's complaint.
We haven't heard from most of them, but T-Mobile responded: "T-Mobile appreciates the concerns expressed by Public Knowledge in its petition, and we will provide input when it is put out for comment. We would clarify that T-Mobile follows all laws governing Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) and provides annual reports to the FCC regarding regulatory compliance in this area. We do not sell personally identifiable CPNI data to third parties except in three cases: 1) we obtain the user's consent; 2) we provide it in aggregate form; or 3) we anonymize the data."
Sprint declined to comment.
AT&T's sale of the data to the CIA was revealed in the New York Times on November 7. As we explained in our previous coverage, AT&T retains the call metadata but "performs searches against its databases for specific phone numbers upon request from the CIA... Unlike the NSA's metadata collection from telephone companies, the CIA's relationship with AT&T is not under a warrant, as it focuses on overseas calls not necessarily covered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or the Patriot Act."
"In all cases, whenever any governmental entity anywhere seeks information from us, we ensure that the request and our response are completely lawful and proper," AT&T told Ars last month. "We ensure that we maintain customer information in compliance with the laws of the United States and other countries where information may be maintained. Like all telecom providers, we routinely charge governments for producing the information provided. We do not comment on questions concerning national security."
Public Knowledge said the call data shouldn't be shared even if carriers purge the logs of names and phone numbers but predicted that carriers will argue that it's not a violation because data is anonymized.
"We think the pushback will come from carriers claiming that they always 'anonymize' CPNI before they share it," Moy wrote. "For example, according to the Times article, AT&T 'masks' several digits of Americans' phone numbers before sharing records with the CIA. But we don't think anonymizing records exempts them from Section 222 protections... Even after personal identifiers have been removed from a dataset, sufficient information that is not traditionally thought of as personally identifiable often remains to 're-identify' specific people... [R]ecently, researchers succeeded in using publicly available information to identify Netflix subscribers in a dataset of movie ratings from which personal identifiers had been removed. 'Removing identifying information is not sufficient for anonymity,' the researchers explained. And earlier this year, researchers used a dataset of 'anonymized' location data from an unidentified mobile phone carrier to demonstrate that 95 percent of individual users could be uniquely identified using just four location data points."
Public Knowledge asked the FCC to issue a declaratory ruling stating AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile must not sell the records in question without customers' consent.
Here's a look at the full complaint to the FCC:
CHICAGO — Mike Pantazis has advice for their three sons: Don't try to make the catch they did.
Pantazis is celebrating the 20-year anniversary of their infamous catch of an extra point from the Soldier Field stands with a party at Abbey Pub, 3420 W. Grace St. in Lakeview, on Saturday.
Pantazis, a Rogers Park native, said the coolest part of the catch was having three sons — Michael Jr., 11; Joey, 10; and Nick, 7 — old enough to understand "what this is all about."
"They are so amazed and have so much fun with it," Pantazis said Monday night. "Their teachers ask them about it, their friends watch clips of it, and although they know not to attempt something like this, they are proud of it."
Pantazis became instantly famous when they jumped out of the Soldier Field stands and snatched a converted extra point out of midair during a Bears game against the Green Bay Packers on Sept. 11, 1995. Pantazis was interviewed by Lynn Swann immediately after the catch, when they proudly said they were "from the North Side of Chicago" and they "played football at Sullivan High School."
Pantazis later appeared on the David Letterman show, and ESPN named their catch one of the best in history. There's even been a documentary — "Off Into Space" — made about Pantazis' incredible leap and grab.
Off Into Space (2011): a mini-documentary from silentRebel on Vimeo.
"Twenty years seems like such a long time, but not in this case," Pantazis said. "It has been so much fun and I have had so many exciting endeavors with this."
Pantazis chose Abbey Pub for the event because its bar's main lighting fixture is fashioned from a drum kit used by Pantazis' band, Some Years Later (SYL). Pantazis, who plays guitar, said the band and the drum lighting piece were featured on Spike TV's "Bar Rescue."
At the party, which begins at 7 p.m. Saturday, Pantazis will be giving away free autographed pictures of their famous catch. Saturday is Pantazis' 49th birthday, and SYL also will be performing at the bar.
"I just want to express how thankful I am to everyone who has supported me over the years, the fun times that I have with everyone who come up to me to talk about it, and for the opportunities that have come from this," they said.

VEmpire is a turn-based card game about building an empire that is stronger than your opponent's!
As soon as one player has 50 points in their empire, they are going to win. The opponent has three turns to catch up. The player can choose to play against the AI, invite a friend for a casual game, or play a match against a selected opponent.
VEmpire is a deckbuilding game like Dominion or Ascension, just to name two popular games of this genre. It provides innovative mechanics and an exciting, atmospheric theme that is about the resurgence of the Hapsburg rulers as terrific vampires!
VEmpire includes more than 100 unique cards in four classes, it will have a fixed-price and it comes to PC, MAC & Linux first through Steam. The iOS, Android & Wii-U versions will follow soon!
BUILD YOUR EMPIRE
It is the goal of the game to build a strong empire of cards on the game board not in the decks!

For hundreds of years the cruel Kings of Hapsburg have ruled Europe making history all over the world. Now they are back again: Bloody and bizarre shine the emperors, kings and dukes of the days gone again - dangerous but glorious - as Vampires of the Empire - the Kings of Darkness.
At the same time, different generations have returned into the old world to meet each other again at the battlefield of power and influence. Four classes of power are fighting for taking control of the dark kingdom. – Where will you fight?
The history of the Hapsburg dynasty is the inspiration for our extraordinary theme.
Our artists did an amazing job in turning mighty rulers into terrific vampires. Our cards are subtle interpretations of historical characters, places and events.
The artwork and its music and sound makes VEmpire a stunning game with unique play & atmosphere.
Horrible but always elegant and of course lurid, but just a little!
VEmpire is a digital deckbuilding game. A deckbuilding game is a card game where building a powerful deck is part of the game itself - in opposite to a CCG (Collectible Card-Game) where the deck is being assembled before the match starts.
In a typical deckbuilding game both players start with a weak start-deck. They can acquire better cards with a “currency” that the already owned cards are providing! Newly acquired cards go into the discard pile of the player, they will be drawn later. At the beginning of the game and at the end of each turn a hand of five cards is drawn from your deck. If your deck is empty, your discard pile will be shuffled and become the new deck. All cards, which lead to victory (or defeat) are available within the game through normal play!
WHAT IS THE GOAL? It is the goal to gather empire-points. They can be collected by playing cards with empire-points from your hand into your Empire on the board. If the empire-value of a player is 50 or more points this player is about to win.
They will win if the opponent cannot catch up within the next 3 rounds!
GAME START The game starts with the flip of two cards. The same card twice means that you will choose your class first and play first. The opponent will therefore select their class from the remaining ones. Each player starts with a start-deck of 10 cards: 9 Mercenaries and one Location-card.
THE MARKET-PLACE You could buy new and better cards from the Market-Place with the gulden-values from your cards by playing them from your hand for acquiring.
As the game starts, the Market-Place is built out of the cards from both selected classes.
The two leftmost cards are your private deck and consists of vampire & realm cards of your selected class.
The two rightmost cards are the private deck of your opponent. Only they can buy those cards.
However with spell-cards you can banish cards also from your opponent's private cards.
The three cards in the middle of the Market-Place are the location- and spell-cards of both classes!
This means that each class-duel combination provides a fresh and unique collection of cards which offers different tactical and strategic challenges and possibilities.
TURN BREAKDOWN
At the beginning of the game and at the end of each turn each player draws 5 cards from their deck.
The player in second place draws 6 cards, but only in the first round.
If you have not enough guldens to buy a card, but you have a mercenary in your hand, you can sacrifice it for as many guldens as you need for buying the most expensive card!
Before the cards for the next turn are being drawn from the player's deck, all played cards (except the “held” ones) go back into the players discard-pile.
This means that played cards will stay in the game and will appear again later because if the deck is empty the discard-pile will be shuffled and becomes the new deck.
This is not true for cards, which were played into the empire, or cards which have gone in the graveyard!
(Be aware: already played cards as well as currently acquired cards cannot be played twice within a turn!
If such cards are in the discard-pile and this needs to be shuffled, those cards will stay in the discard-pile!)
In your turn, you can:
Play vampire-cards from your hand into the Market-Place for acquiring
Play vampire-cards from your hand into your empire to increase your power
Play location-cards from your hand into your empire for additional guldens each turn
Play spell-cards from your hand for immediate effects
Play power-cards and surprise your opponent
Hold cards until the next turn
CLASSES
All cards belong to one of four specific classes.
Each class is equivalent with a specific time-period. This means that the original characters or items were relevant at this time.
At the beginning of the game the player can select the class they want to play with.
This means that they try to build their empire with cards of this class.
Therefore, both players have their own private-decks available for acquiring at the Market-Place exclusively.
Class I (1237-1526)
(1237-1526) Class II (1526-1648)
(1526-1648) Class III (1648-1792)
(1648-1792) Class IV (1792-1914 )
VAMPIRE & REALM-CARDS
The most important cards in the game provide Empire- and/or Gulden-values.
They can be played into the Empire or for Acquiring new cards with their Gulden-values by playing into the Market-Place. If played into the Empire the cards will stay there, if played for acquiring they will go back into your Discard-Pile after each turn.
The 9 Mercenaries in the start-deck are also Realm-Cards!
GROUP-CARDS
Group-Cards are special Vampire- or Realm-cards that belong together (⚭ symbol). They are the most powerful entities in VEmpire!
If a whole group is being played into the player's empire their values will count twice, otherwise they will not count at all!
If a group is being entirely played into the empire within one turn, one extra point is added per card!
POWER-CARDS
Three types of power-cards are available:
POWER-HAND
If you acquire a card of this type it goes into your hand immediately!
If you acquire a card of this type it goes into your hand immediately! POWER-PLAY
If you play a card of this type into your empire you can take any card from
the Market-Place into your hand without paying it's cost!
If you play a card of this type into your empire you can take any card from the Market-Place into your hand without paying it's cost! POWER-DRAW
If you play a card of this type into your empire further cards will be drawn from your deck!
LOCATION-CARDS
"Locations" provide additional guldens and hold-values each turn. One hold-value means that you can hold one card in your hand until the next turn! They can be played into the Empire only, but be careful they can also be banished by a spell-card!
SPELL-CARDS
Spell-Cards provide various additional effects depending on the Spell-Type:
BANISH
You can banish a card from the Market-Place or the opponent's location-deck
You can banish a card from the Market-Place or the opponent's location-deck DRAW
Draw additional cards from your deck into your hand
Draw additional cards from your deck into your hand CURSE
This card is played into your opponent's empire and deals a certain amount of damage
This card is played into your opponent's empire and deals a certain amount of damage CLONE
A card from your hand or discard-Pile can be cloned
A card from your hand or discard-Pile can be cloned REVIVE
A card from the graveyard can be revived
First of all: In VEmpire you can play against the AI without beeing connected to the internet!
If logged in you can invite a friend for a casual game or play a match against an opponent that the server find suitable for you!
After three years of work the game is almost done in it's core, also the hard parts like PvP!
We've also had a successful alpha-phase and gathered great feedback from our players.
Many suggestions have found the way into the upcoming Beta, and have made the game to an
even more exciting experience!
The game is also already greenlit on steam, thanks to our amazing community!
Although the game is almost done, you can already subsribe to the beta (web-version) on our website, it is still effort required to bring the game to the target platforms in a quality that fulfills your & our expectations!
Also the PvP modes requires a huge amount of additional testing.
All this means more time and money.
Therefore we want to check if there is potential for VEmpire on Kickstarter, simply because additional money would speed up the time to release a lot!
Additionally we could need any kind of valuable and free promotion we can get!
Collective is brilliant and a real powerful way for us to find and chat with players and collect feedback.
Thanks for all the support in advance!

A majority of Houston Texans players took a knee Sunday during the national anthem ahead of their game against the Seattle Seahawks in protest against controversial remarks made by the team's owner.
Texans owner Bob McNair had met with the team Saturday morning and apologized for their previous comments that "we can't have the inmates running the prison" during a meeting of NFL owners.
Even after the meeting with McNair, the Texans held a players meeting in Seattle to decide how to game the game Sunday, ESPN reported, citing a league source.
HOUSTON TEXANS OWNER MAKES SECOND APOLOGY FOR 'INMATES RUNNING THE PRISON' REMARK
Texans left tackle Duane Brown told ESPN they anticipate "up to 65 to 70 percent" of the team's players could kneel as part of the protest in Seattle, adding the players would not remove the team's decals from their helmets as had been discussed.
McNair's remarks caused a firestorm of criticism from athletes inside and outside the NFL and prompted an initial apology from the 79-year-old Friday.
"I know they were upset," McNair told the Houston Chronicle about their meeting with the players. "I wanted to answer their questions. I told them if I had it to do over again I wouldn't use that expression."
NFL PLAYERS SEEK MEETING WITH GOODELL, MCNAIR, KAEPERNICK
The comment was published in an ESPN The Magazine story about two recent days of meetings among owners, players and others to discuss the protests that have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.
Players, following the lead of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, say they kneel to protest social injustices, particularly against African-Americans. Trump has sharply criticized the protests and even called on NFL owners to fire players.
The meetings earlier this month did not result in a policy change that would require players to stand for the anthem. Owners and players are expected to meet again next week to discuss initiatives.

I just got a bill for some extra property tax I owe to a county in California. The story behind it is sad and sort of hilarious.
A year or two ago I got billed in an audit for some "California use tax" on some golf carts we moved to California from Arizona. I hadn't thought I owed use tax on them because I paid sales tax in Arizona where I bought them. But California sales tax is higher than that in Arizona (naturally) so I apparently owed use tax on the difference. OK, I paid it.
Then, just recently, I was informed by one county in California that my property tax reports were wrong. I reported the value of the gold carts based on what I bought them for but I did not include the California use tax in the value. That had to be added to their value (even though in actuality the use tax made them less valuable). Anyway, I got a tax bill for the property tax I owe on the value of the use tax I paid for carts, which in turn was based on the higher rate of sales taxes charged in California than Arizona. All because I actually moved business assets into California.
Won't make that mistake again! Over the last 5 years I have pulled nearly a half million dollars in business assets out of California, terminated 5 contracts, and laid off nearly 100 employees there -- all mostly due to the hostile business environment there.

Small carved stones unearthed in a nearly 5,000-year-old burial site could represent the earliest gaming tokens ever found, according to Turkish archaeologists who are excavating early Bronze Age graves.
Found in a grave at Başur Höyük, a 820- by 492-foot mound near Siirt in southeast Turkey, the elaborate pieces consist of 49 small stones sculpted in different shapes and painted in green, red, blue, black and white.
"Some depict pigs, dogs and pyramids, others feature round and bullet shapes. We also found dice as well as three circular tokens made of white shell and topped with a black round stone," Haluk Sağlamtimur of Ege University in İzmir, Turkey, told Discovery News.
Pieces of The Earliest Games Found: Photos
According to the archaeologist, who presented their finding at the annual symposium of excavations, surveys and archaeometry in Muğla, similar pieces were previously found in Tell Brak and Jemdet Nasr, two settlement mounds in northeastern Syria and in Iraq, respectively.
"But they were found as isolated, single objects, therefore they were believed to be counting stones," Sağlamtimur said.
"On the contrary, our gaming pieces were found all together in the same cluster. It's a unique finding, a rather complete set of a chess like game. We are puzzling over its strategy," they added.

The find confirms that board games likely originated and spread from the Fertile Crescent regions and Egypt more than 5,000 years ago (Senet from predynastic Egypt is considered the world's oldest game board). The tokens were accompanied by badly preserved wooden pieces or sticks. Sağlamtimur hopes they'll provide some hints on the rules and logic behind the game.
"According to distribution, shape and numbers of the stone pieces, it appears that the game is based on the number 4," they said.
Much more elaborate, the newly discovered gaming stones were found in one of nine graves found at Başur Höyük. The burials revealed metal artifacts, ceramic finds and seals with different attributes and influences. This indicates the local people had close connections with their surrounding cultural regions.Radio carbon dating traced the grave goods back to 3100-2900 B.C., confirming the Early Bronze Age stylistic features of the items and the advanced technological level of the local population.

Archaeological records indicate that board games were widely played in Mesopotamia. Several beautifully crafted boards were found by British archaeologist Leonard Wooley in the Royal cemetery of Ur, the ancient Sumerian city near the modern Iraqi city of Nasiriya, which many consider the cradle of civilization.
Dating from the First Dynasty of Ur, around 2550-2400 B.C., the boards were associated with the "Game of Twenty Squares," a board game played around 3000 B.C. Beautiful tokens related to the game were found arranged in a row, with the colors alternating, in another Ur tomb. The set consisted of seven shell roundels inlaid with of five lapis lazuli dots and seven roundels of black shale inlaid with five dots of white shell.
Much more elaborate, the newly discovered gaming stones were recovered from one of nine graves found at Başur Höyük. The site was inhabited as early as from 7,000 B.C. and was on a trade route between Mesopotamia and East Anatolia.
Overall, the graves revealed a unique treasure made of painted and unpainted pottery, bronze spearhead, various ritual artifacts, seals with geometric motifs and about 300 well-preserved amorphous bronze artifacts.
The majority of pots featured bitumen residues. Sağlamtimur believes bitumen was most likely part of a burial ritual or was applied to prevent secondary use of the pots.
Tens of thousands of beads made of mountain crystal and other types of stones were also recovered from the burials.
"The gaming pieces, thousands of beads, hundreds of complete pots and metal artifacts indicate those graves were not ordinary burials but most probably belonged to individuals of a ruling class," Sağlamtimur said.

Radio carbon dating traced the grave goods back to 3100-2900 B.C., confirming the Early Bronze Age stylistic features of the items and the advanced technological level of the local population.
"The graves contained metal artifacts, ceramic finds and seals with different attributes and influences which indicate the local people were in close relationship with their surrounding cultural regions," Sağlamtimur said.
By the middle of the 4000 B.C., when the first great cities of history sprung up in Mesopotamia, the influence of the South Mesopotamia Uruk culture spread to the surrounding regions.
Significant differences emerged between the western communities of the Syrian-Turkish Euphrates Valley and the eastern settlements of the Al Jazira, the river plain of Mesopotamia which encompasses northwestern Iraq and northeastern Syria.

In the western communities, the urbanization process was halted, while clans with warrior leaders announced their power through complex funerary rites and burials rich with metal and weapons.
Meanwhile, the urbanization process continued in the eastern settlements with the development of a new culture called Ninivite 5. Like the Uruk culture, Ninivite 5 did not pay great attention to the funerary rites and burials were not particularly rich with artifacts.
"The findings at Başur Höyük add to our knowledge as they reveal a coexistence of traditions and a continuity of relationships between the settlements in the northern mountains and the Mesopotamia sites," Marcella Frangipane, a professor of prehistoric archaeology at Rome's La Sapienza, told Discovery News.
Frangipane is the director of excavations at Arslantepe, a remote site near the town of Malatya and the source of the Euphrates in south-eastern Turkey, some 250 miles west from Başur Höyük.
"The study of these findings, along with other discoveries in east-Anatolian sites, will allow us to reconstruct a new history of this region which is indeed the meeting point of the most ancient Near East civilizations," Frangipane said.
Last week gallerist Gary Nader presented details of the new Latin American Art Museum he's proposing, along with the big reveal of its location on Biscayne Boulevard, in an exhibition at their Wynwood gallery. Aside from a looping slideshow and model displaying renderings of both the proposed museum and future surrounding residential towers by FR-EE (architects Fernando Romero Enterprise, who are also designing Doral's stunning Our Lady of Guadalupe church), perhaps the most important detail is that the museum and two accompanying residential towers are intended for a full block site on 5th Avenue & Biscayne Boulevard, between the AmericanAirlines Arena, the Freedom Tower, and Miami Dade College.
The model provides a great sense of scale and more accurately depicts the rather large ground level plaza—a true "public" plaza that would ideally activate Biscayne Boulevard in a way no other building currently does (outdoor seating for the museum cafe, permanent and rotating public art installations, and hopefully more trees). —Intended for the site. The model also does a great job of expressing the vertical screen system used throughout the building, which seems to play with pattern density in order to control daylight, as well as views from the exterior.
According to a video released by FR-EE, the museum itself is a play on the compression of a single mass, and its subsequent expansion through terraces that twist slightly at each level. The first level would house a museum shop and cafe, as well as an exhibition space for young emerging artists. The second level would house temporary exhibitions, and the permanent collections would be on the third. A restaurant would be located on the fourth level overlooking Museum Park, the arena, Bayfront Park, and Biscayne Bay beyond, assuming SkyRise Miami doesn't block the view.
According to The Next Miami, the 90,000 SF museums is scheduled to open sometime in 2016 at a cost of $50 million, with the 300-unit residential towers following after (according to FR-EE, the towers will have only 111 units, although this is likely still in the early stages of planning, and 111 does seem like quite a low number for two huge towers). Aside from a few "this could be anywhere" interior and balcony renderings, unfortunately there wasn't much information on the towers (even the model is completely generic). Sketches sent in by a Curbed reader, however, do appear to show how the placement of the public plaza and museum towards the street, with the towers set behind, would preserve the all-important vistas of the Freedom Tower next door.—Margina Demmer

Social scientists have known for a long time that people who have divorced parents are more likely to experience divorce in their own lives. For example, a 1991 study published in the Journal of Family Issues found that parental divorce increased the risk of ending one's own marriage within the first five years by 70 percent. More recent studies have yielded similar conclusions, with some finding that the odds of divorce are even higher.
It has long been assumed that what's going on here is that when parents divorce, it changes their kids in ways that later undermine their own marriages. For example, some have argued that parental divorce weakens people's views on marriage, thereby creating less commitment to the institution. Others have argued that perhaps parental divorce has a detrimental effect on children's interpersonal skills and that this is ultimately what harms their relationships.
While these environmental factors undoubtedly play at least some role, a forthcoming study in the journal Psychological Science titled "Genetics, the Rearing Environment, and the Intergenerational Transmission of Divorce" suggests the provocative possibility that the answer is also partly genetic. In other words, some people may carry genes that increase the odds of ending a marriage.
So how did researchers come to that conclusion? Well, they did what scientists often do when they want to start sorting out the effects of biology versus the environment: they look at people who were adopted as children and compare how similar they are to both their biological and adopted relatives.
In this study, researchers conducted three separate tests using data from the Swedish national registry. This provided a massive dataset in which they could look at what happened in tens of thousands of cases over a long period of time.
Watch More From Tonic:
In the first test, the authors used a "classical adoption design," in which they looked at how 19,715 adoptees' own divorce experiences were related to those of both their biological and adoptive parents. What they found was that, whereas adoptees' divorce patterns tended to resemble those of their biological parents, they were completely unrelated to those of their adoptive parents. In other words, it was only when people's biological parents got divorced that they were more likely to get divorced themselves.
In the second test, the authors used an "extended adoption design," in which they looked at 82,698 people's own divorce experiences and how they were related to those of biological parents they lived growing up with versus biological parents they didn't live with when they were growing up. Just like in the first test, if you had a biological parent you didn't live with, your divorce history tended to resemble theirs.
Interestingly, however, this test also revealed that people's divorce risk resembled that of the biological parents they did live with. And, in fact, this link was the stronger of the two, which suggests that both biology and the environment are playing a role in divorce risk.
Finally, in the third test, the authors looked at how people's divorce experiences were related to those of both their biological and adopted siblings. They found that people's own divorces had no link whatsoever to divorces of their adopted siblings. However, people were more likely to divorce when a full or half sibling who was raised by another family got divorced.
Together, what all three of these tests tell us is that divorce seems to be hereditary to some extent. Researchers consistently found that people's odds of divorce were linked to those of their biological—but not adoptive—relatives.
To be clear, this does not mean that some of us are carriers of a "divorce gene" that destroys marriages. That's not what anyone here is arguing. Instead, what the researchers believe is going on is that a specific set of personality traits—namely, high levels of neuroticism and low levels of constraint—tend to run in families, and these traits are what increase the odds of divorce.
Indeed, high neuroticism, or emotional instability, and low constraint, or impulsiveness, have been shown in previous studies to increase divorce risk.
It is also important to point out that this study doesn't imply that divorce is entirely genetic—the results of the second test comparing lived-with vs. non-lived-with parents suggest that the environment also plays an indirect role. In other words, there's probably a social learning component to all of this as well.
With all of that said, these results don't mean that divorce is destiny for those whose parents have separated. Having divorced parents isn't necessarily a death knell for your own marriage. Many people with divorced parents go on to have perfectly happy and healthy relationships. But if you have the type of personality that creates a predisposition to divorce, seeking therapy or counseling early on may be worthwhile by helping to blunt the impact of these traits on your relationship.

Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign attempted to dispel rumors that their team started Obama “birther” rumors after Donald Trump pointed the blame their way, but now a D.C. bureau chief is saying they were the source.
On Friday, Donald Trump attempted to put the “birther” movement to rest by acknowledging that President Obama was born in the United States and pinning the blame on Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Trump said:
“Hillary Clinton and their campaign of 2008 started the birthed controversy. I finished it.”
However, in the hours following the allegation, the Clinton campaign said the only proof that Clinton perpetuated “birther” rumors was when a low-level volunteer produced a memo advising Clinton to capitalize on Obama's lack of “American roots.” That volunteer staffer, they said, was terminated right away.
Following the Clinton campaign's rebuke of Trump's claims, the former Washington bureau chief of McClatchy Newspapers suggested Clinton allies were the source:

https://twitter.com/jimasher/status/776633213015982080
James Asher pointed to Sidney Blumenthal as the source for the birther rumors. In a statement to McClatchy, Asher made a more detailed statement about the matter, and said that they sent a reporter to Kenya to dig up the story:
“During that meeting, Mr. Blumenthal and I met together in my office and they strongly urged me to investigate the exact place of President Obama's birth, which they suggested was in Kenya. We assigned a reporter to go to Kenya, and that reporter determined that the allegation was false. “At the time of Mr. Blumenthal's conversation with me, there had been few news articles published in various outlets reporting on rumors about Obama's birthplace. While Mr. Blumenthal offered no concrete proof of Obama's Kenyan birth, I felt that, as journalists, we had a responsibility to determine whether or not those rumors were true. They were not.”
Following Asher's claims, Blumenthal told Fox News:
“This is false. Never happened. Period. Donald Trump cannot distract from the inescapable fact that they are the one who embraced and promoted the racist birther lie and bears the responsibility for it.”
Blumenthal has long been entangled in the Clinton family's political life, starting as a staffer for Bill Clinton in the 1990s. They were also an adviser to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008.
Blumenthal was back in the news following the release of Hillary Clinton's private server emails while working at the State Department. Despite working for the Clinton Foundation at the time, Blumenthal sent frequent memos to Clinton with regard to State Department matters, and they frequently adopted the advice they gave them
It appears every heavyweight fighter on the UFC's roster has shown some form of interest in welcoming Fedor Emelianenko to the Octagon, even though the Russian heavyweight legend is yet to sign a contract officially signaling their arrival. The latest such heavyweight was Mark Hunt, who expressed some slight disappointment as to nto getting a chance to rematch the legend at the UFC 193 stadium show.
"I don't know why they retired," Hunt told Submission Radio. "I mean everyone has their reasons, but that's a long time coming. He's one of the greatest fighters of all time. I was hopefully looking forward to welcoming them back as a rematch. I was hoping it'd be with me in Melbourne somewhere, but I guess not. We'll see what happens. It's good that Fedor's back in the fighting circles, and especially with the UFC. I mean that's where the best players are right now and that's where the party's at (laughs).
"UFC is where the party's at."
While Hunt admits they did not specifically ask the UFC brass for a rematch against Fedor, they hoped against hope that they would be the one to draw the ‘Last Emperor. '
"Well I never ask [for specific opponents] unless it's some freakin' guy talking rubbish, but I never ask for that person. But it was just a thought. When I heard they were coming back, I was like 'oh maybe I can welcome them to the UFC in Melbourne'. Who knows?"
Construction work on a new 24-hour homeless services shelter in Arlington is expected to begin this spring after the Arlington County Board on Tuesday unanimously approved a $6.6 million construction contract with a minimum of objections.
The shelter, which will occupy two of seven floors in an existing building at 2020 14th Street, across a parking lot from the county building and across the street from the police headquarters, had sparked outrage from nearby residents when it was first announced more than two years ago.
“This should be a time for rejoicing, not complaining,” said County Board chairperson Jay Fisette (D). “This is a terrific project — it's been in the works for decades and will help folks in a difficult place in pull their lives together.”
The center will have a year-round dormitory of 50 beds, an additional 25 beds during winter months, and five medical beds. It will replace the aging current winter-only shelter at 2049 N. 15th Street, about a block and a half away. Arlington Street Peoples Network operates the existing shelter, and will operate the new one, under a contract with the county. The new one is expected to be finished by early 2015.
In addition to the construction costs (which includes a $1.1 million contingency fund), another $1.5 million will be spent on design, administration fees, permits and inspections. Furnishing, security and IT equipment will add another $758,000.
The building was purchased for $27.1 million a year ago. The rest of the building will be devoted to a variety of county offices. First-floor retailers will remain in the building.
Unlike the hours-long, pitched battles of the past when some neighbors objected to the proximity of a homeless shelter while supporters pointed out the need for it, Tuesday's vote drew only two speakers: Audrey Clement, a regular presence who wanted an independent auditor to examine the costs of the shelter, and Ann Felker, a volunteer who supported the shelter on behalf of other volunteers.
FOXES AREN'T JUST found wandering around woodlands in the countryside- urban foxes are very common in cities.
They've even been seen roaming around Grafton Street in Dublin with dens near the Dáil.
Isabela Berman sent us in this photo of a fox that they spotted near Lincoln Place this week.
But don't worry - Irish Wildlife Matters told TheJournal.ie, “You can be sure they are more scared of you than you are of them.”
In the suburbs foxes do best in estates of houses with large gardens. Areas such as Sandymount show a high density of the creatures.
However, they can also be found in industrial estates and in some council housing areas.
During this time of the year the cubs are emerging from the den.
They will spend a lot of time basking in the sunshine (when we have it) and lying up in bushes and long grass.
What to do if you see a fox
If you spot a fox the advice is… don't panic.
Foxes are pretty harmless and they will run away if approached but don't try to corner it as it could bite in panic.
Now be warned some of these guys may seem pretty bold and brave.
This fox was snapped in the Leinster House car park last winter and wasn't too put out by the people nearby.

Some foxes won't even run away when shouted at from a window, while others can be seen strolling around or lying back enjoying the sun.
This is mostly because urban foxes have become habituated to the city.
If you do see a fox you can go to Irish Wildlife Matters and get the number of a local wildlife rehabilitator for more advice.

Do not disturb
If you don't want foxes coming to your garden – you need to get rid of their food source, so:
Don't leave out any food or food waste
Keep your bins closed and secured
Feed your pets indoors.
You'll also need to make sure that your neighbours are following the same rules.
If you'd like more information on foxes you can go to Conserve Ireland or check out some frequently asked questions at IWM.
Misunderstood
Fox owner, Mike Towler, thinks that foxes get a bad reputation because they are painted as villains in children's stories.
They say, “They have the nicest nature of any animal I have ever met, they are considerate, helpful – particularly towards young foxes.”
Towler also points out that foxes provide a very useful function as they destroy the rats and mice you don't want.
They seem pretty comfortable with their fox who plays a little football and gets a wash and blow dry in this video:
TRIP Positive Loitering 2013 View Full Caption
IRVING PARK — When The Residents of Irving Park first began holding "positive loitering" events — essentially a group of people hanging out at a neighborhood trouble spot to encourage positive behavior — "it used to be guns and gangs," said Misha Mann, president of the group.
"We actually, the first or second one, saw a guy dealing out of the back of their house," recalled Irving Birkner, TRIP board member. "We busted him."
The issues are less threatening these days, Mann said, in part because of increased community involvement. "Now it's loud music and pot."
Today, the group is as likely to deploy positive loitering to resolve a contentious situation between neighbors as it is to send a message to gang members.
On Wednesday night, TRIP coordinated what to outsiders might look like a block party or spontaneous picnic, complete with food trucks. The presence of police officers and Ald. Richard Mell (33rd) told a different story.
"We've got a problem here we can resolve," said Mell, who quoted from "Cool Hand Luke": "What we have here is a failure to communicate."
Mell and the residents were out in support of Douglas and Kimberly Pancoast, who bought a house on Troy Avenue in 2011 after saving up for years.
"We love the house. We love the neighborhood," Kimberly Pancoast said.
Then the parties started next door. Twenty to 30 people coming and going into the wee hours, music blaring until 3 or 4 a.m., open drug use.
"I have an 11-year-old daughter who has to go [inside] every time they come out," Pancoast said.
Calls to police and the apartment building's owner had little effect. Holding a positive loitering event outside the building Wednesday night, a clear signal from neighbors that the Pancoasts had the neighborhood's backing, was the couple's Hail Mary pass.
"This is our last thing to try to do what we can before we flip the house," they said.
Buoyed by the presence of dozens of neighbors, the Pancoasts confronted Mike Balbuena, who manages the apartment building in question.
"I feel like for the first time, somebody is acting," Kimberly Pancoast said. "We're not alone."
Their request: No open drug use, no loud music after 10:30 or 11:30 p.m., and no cigarette butts, beer bottles or roach clips tossed into their yard.
When asked how they had handled complaints in the past, Balbuena said, "My response was to tell them to call the police."
Of the loud music, they said, a tenant "was in the Marines. Whenever they come back, they have their celebration. It's an ethnic thing, ma'am."
Lazaro Magdariaga, who lives behind the Pancoasts and has been identified by the couple as part of the problem, said, "I can see lowering the music, especially at night. Open drug use ... it's almost part of our culture. It's only a problem when it comes to selling drugs."
After nearly an hour of dialog, Douglas Pancoast, an architect and professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, felt progress had been made.
"I feel better," they said. "I think it's going to be a lot better."
Added their wife: "We're talking. It seemed like something different happened."
As evidenced Wednesday evening, positive loitering is as much about building community as it is about preventing crime.
"This gets everybody out, everybody talking," Mann said. "People know each other on the block. One person looks out for another because they met them."
Libertarians tend to think of freedom as either a means to an end of maximum utility—e.g., free markets produce the most wealth—or, in a more philosophical sense, in opposition to arbitrary authority—e.g., “Who are you to tell me what to do?” Both views fuel good arguments for less government and more personal autonomy. Yet neither separately, nor both taken together, address the impediments to freedom that have plagued the United States since its founding. Many of the oppressions America has foisted upon its citizens, particularly its black citizens, indeed came from government actors and agents. But a large number of offenses, from petty indignities to incidents of unspeakable violence, have been perpetrated by private individuals, or by government with full approval of its white citizens. I would venture that many, if not most libertarians—like the general American public—haven't come to terms with the widespread, systemic subversion of markets and democracy American racism wreaked on its most marginalized citizens. Consequently, libertarians have concentrated rather myopically on government reform as the sole function of libertarian social critique without taking full reckoning of what markets have failed to correct throughout American history.
Take, for example, the common libertarian/conservative trope: “We believe in equal opportunity, not equal outcomes.” Most people, outside of the few and most ardent socialists, should believe that is a fair statement. But to say such a thing as a general defense of the status quo assumes that the current American system offers roughly equal opportunity just because Jim Crow is dead. Yet, that cannot possibly be true.
Think of the phrase “Don't go there, it's a bad neighborhood.” Now, sometimes that neighborhood is just a little run down, doesn't have the best houses, doesn't have the best shopping nearby, or feeds a mediocre school. But, more often, that neighborhood is very poor, lacks decent public infrastructure, suffers from high unemployment, has the worst schools, and is prone to gang or other violence. And, in many cities—in both North and South—that neighborhood is almost entirely populated by minorities.
There are only two conclusions possible when facing the very real prospect that thousands or millions of Americans live in areas you warn your friends not to go, even by accident: Either everyone in those areas is a criminal, or is content to live among and be victimized by criminals; or there is some number of people, and probably a large one, trapped in living conditions that cannot help but greatly inhibit their opportunities for success and advancement. As Ta-Nehisi Coates lays out in the latest issue of the Atlantic, that those neighborhoods are racially segregated is no accident. Jim Crow's death is worth celebrating but hardly sufficient for establishing equal opportunity in any meaningful sense, especially when our society still effectively traps people in these conditions by both law and custom, based in no small part on their race.
So what is a libertarian to do about all this?
As I mentioned in my previous essay, libertarians must recognize that racism still plays a practical and tangible role in the lives of American blacks. So long as libertarians brush racism aside as incidental or irrelevant to public policy, people who see and feel its effects in their neighborhoods, in their schools, and in their interactions with police, are unlikely to take what libertarians say seriously. Disparate treatment in education, criminal justice, and the economy are facts of life for many black Americans, and libertarians should take an active role in combating it, both through policy suggestions and in our personal lives. Part of this requires a deeper understanding of American history, and specifically the history of American racism.
On some basic level, representative government reflects the will of the people it serves—that is, those to whom government actors feel most accountable. Historically speaking, within the United States, such a government and a coalition of individuals and institutions—bankers, shopkeepers, restaurateurs, police officers, teachers, judges, landlords, election officials, bartenders, homeowners, receptionists, doctors, and other white citizens—exerted power that threatened to disrupt or upend the lives of black individuals at whim over many years. This white supremacy was true throughout most of the United States, with varying degrees of brutality and certitude. Racism has been part and parcel of America since its inception, often to the extent that racism not only trumped common decency and the Rule of Law, but economic self-interest. The dominant libertarian assumption that rational economic self-interest would trump racism if government just got out of the way fails to reckon with more than 200 years of evidence to the contrary.
Consequently, the strident libertarian argument against positive law and government writ large flies directly in the face of the historical black experience. The federal government protected the rights of freedmen and established schools during Reconstruction, only to abandon blacks to Southern white terrorism in the name of States' Rights. Positive law destroyed Jim Crow, breaking up both formal and informal segregation in accommodations not just in the South where it was law, but throughout other parts of the country where it was standard practice within a supposedly free market. The federal government took an active role in criminal justice because local police often did not investigate anti-black terrorism and murders—or, if they did, sometimes testified in the murderers' defense. And today, governments offer jobs with security and benefits in a job market that still disfavors blacks. This is not to say that blacks are particular fans of Big Government, but all of these government actions addressed problems in private society—ranging from indifference to murderous hostility—that should test anyone's faith in an unfettered free market. This does not mean that libertarians should embrace positive law going forward, but simply to recognize Madison's wisdom that “if men were angels, no government would be necessary.”
To wit, while libertarian finger-pointing at New Dealers and early Progressives as racists whose policies excluded or punished black people is based in truth, it is not entirely convincing 70-100 years hence. Whatever one can say about their political preferences, American Progressives have been consciously and conspicuously inclusive of blacks and other marginalized people in the recent past—to their great credit. To equate the Woodrow Wilson Progressives and their Southern Democrat allies with the multiracial, multiethnic coalition that elected Barack Obama is simply unreasonable. Libertarians should challenge the economic wisdom of longstanding Progressive policies, but take away their social programs and you still have a United States fully inhospitable to equal rights for blacks in the early 20th century—for which there was no evident or forthcoming free market solution. (This I note with a touch of irony, given that there is a prevalent libertarian assumption that the dearth of black libertarians is traceable to black ignorance of the benefits of free markets, perhaps enabled by poor public schools. Yet one may argue that libertarians are largely ignorant of how exclusionary American markets were when its moneyed participants were left to their own devices.)
Individuals are the source of racism and race bias, and the institutions they construct are conduits for both, even when individual agents within an institution may not be cognizant of it. The policies and practices of even well-meaning people put into a system that has traditionally abused minorities is likely to continue to do so, even with new inputs. Systems that operate under choices made by people with biases can still result in outcomes detrimental to a race or group, thus effectively punishing blacks and other people outside of power. This is why focusing on a single policy program, like the Drug War, in some ways misses the forest for the trees when it comes to how blacks and the criminal justice system have interacted over time.
Certainly, the Drug War has been the largest driver of the disproportionate black and Hispanic prison populations in recent years, both through the incarceration of non-violent offenders and prosecuting those people involved in the violence associated with prohibition regimes. But the tensions between blacks and the American justice system did not start with Nixon's War on Drugs in 1971.
Before Emancipation, law enforcement hunted down fugitive slaves who fled to the North. After Reconstruction, local law enforcement stripped the recently won civil rights of blacks, including the right to peaceably assemble, the ability testify against white people, and equal protection of the laws. Some offenders, picked up for charges like vagrancy—that is, being black and without a job—were sold back into civil slavery to corporations the profit of local sheriffs' offices and judges under the “convict lease” system—not unlike slave leasing in the antebellum South. Years later, police officers were among the civil servants who sicced dogs, swung batons, and unleashed fire hoses on protesters in the 1960s. Special Weapons [A]nd Tactics teams, or SWAT, were established in the 1970s to help quell white fear of racial unrest and militants such as the Black Panthers. The 1980s saw drug enforcement ramp up, turning American inner cities into war zones. And perhaps most famously, in the 1990s, a home video showed several Los Angeles police officers beating black motorist Rodney King within an inch of their life. Today, SWAT-style raids as standard operating procedure, anecdotes of “driving while black,” and the documented abuse of Stop-and-Frisk tactics in New York City evince the continued tension between law enforcement and black Americans. If the Drug War were to end tomorrow, any belief that the tensions between blacks and the police would stop must be based on entirely ahistorical assumptions.
Most criminal laws since Reconstruction are facially “colorblind,” but enforcement clearly is not and has never been. Context matters, and in the American context, race matters. So when we, as libertarians, talk about what we can do to change people's lives for the better, we have to look at exactly what they're facing and what practical solutions look like. For black Americans, many of those problems have been around for a very long time, in one form or another, and they are directly tied to race.
So, yes, libertarians should continue to argue vehemently against the Drug War, for school choice, and in support of other policies that have been shown to help all people. But it is simply not enough to believe that, given free choices, citizens will make decisions that maximize their own benefit, ultimately to the benefit of all people. The United States' long history with both public and private discrimination is a testament to the power of racial prejudice and its power to overcome rational self-interest. And given the numerous statistics now available—from unemployment disparities to tracking hiring practices to police harassment—it is clear that lingering prejudice contributes to unequal opportunities for American blacks, on top of the myriad obstacles they may face in their neighborhoods and schools.
Libertarians need to actively combat racial prejudice instead of relying on assumptions that the market will work it all out on its own. If libertarians are going to maintain that government answers to racism are usually inappropriate, then libertarians must be among those leading the private, society-driven remedies to injustice. It is not enough to be passively ‘not racist'—libertarians must be actively anti-racism. To do anything else is to accept the status quo and hide behind the logic of markets, despite the deeply seated, inherent illogic of racism.
This means, inter alia, discussing racial impacts of substandard schools (perhaps allaying fears that school choice will lead to more segregation academies), the pernicious effects of antagonistic policing, and explaining whose jobs will likely be lost due to a minimum wage hike. It means trying to remedy the longstanding disconnect between those who push for punitive laws and those who suffer under them. It means supporting community programs to encourage entrepreneurship and funding scholarships for aspiring business leaders. It means talking to black people and audiences like intelligent individuals whose life and family histories may temper enthusiasm for free markets, and not a mass of people too ignorant or dependent to believe in a theoretical version of freedom unknown to them. It means vocally and unequivocally distancing ourselves from people with longstanding racial baggage, be it Confederacy revisionism or career obsessions with black pathology. Then, maybe, libertarians' “It's not us, it's you” message of liberty would turn into something different: a message better received by people with memories of how duplicitously the words “freedom” and “liberty” have been used in this country.
Far too many things can go horribly wrong when one decides to make their or their own computer. Most of these problems are minor and involve losing screws or having a broken floppy drive, but some are considerably nastier. Now, I'm not saying this happens to everyone: only the incompetent and the unlucky, both of which I am. Despite this, however, I've only had a few of these happen to me; the rest are from others' experiences. Remember, with the exception of all but the fourth one on this list, this is what CAN happen, not what will.
The motherboard will rub against the case, make constant contact with the power supply, fall onto a rug, or just make too much contact with your hand.
The power supply will fall off and land on your video card. (*)
If the video card has a particularly heavy heatsink on it and the above happens, the power supply will probably knock it off and fall onto whatever's below, like your modem, NIC, and/or sound card.

(This is true for all clip-based CPU heatsinks.) Getting it on will require the use of an absurdly small screwdriver, a considerable amount of brute force, and luck. The screwdriver will slip and smash into your motherboard at least twice. No actual damage of any kind will occur, except maybe to your blood pressure.

The most likely outcome (a loud scraping noise that will alert you to the problem immediately) is also the least harmful, which is why it will not happen to you. Instead, the fan will quietly get stuck on the cable and kill its motor. Alternatively, one of the fan's blades may snap off, which is louder and funnier but just as unfortunate.
If you have a heavy (450g+) CPU heatsink on a Socket A or Socket 370 motherboard, it will eagerly demonstrate certain basic laws of physics when the computer is moved around and land on the video card, taking the motherboard's plastic socket clip with it.
Every single cable in the entire computer will thwart your attempts to insert the RAM.
When you finally fight back the cables, you will spend approximately fourteen minutes lining up the RAM perfectly with the slot. When you push to get it to go in, it will fall out, and the cables will gleefully return to their former nesting place.
The CD-ROM drive at the top slot will make increasingly worrying noises when turned on. The more you worry about it, the less likely the possibility that it is a serious problem becomes.
The computer will fail to POST when turned on, and will make several loud beeps. If you find a guide to beep codes for your particular BIOS, that particular beep code will turn out not to exist. That does not, of course, stop your BIOS from making it.
You will find that you have bought a 24-pin ATX power supply and a 20-pin ATX motherboard. There are adapters for this, but they are hideous, likely to break, and very clumsy.
You will find that you have bought a 20-pin ATX power supply and a 24-pin ATX motherboard. There are adapters for this, but in addition to being hideous, likely to break, and very clumsy, they do not work.
Applicable to PATA: You will find two PATA cable sockets, which will be different colors. Your PATA cables' plugs will be different colors at both ends, and often the color of one plug will match with the first ATA cable socket and the color of the other plug will match with the second ATA cable socket.**
Applicable to PATA: Your motherboard will deny the existence of an ATA cable in the second plug while booting the devices attached to that cable without trouble. This is unrelated to the colors of the cable plugs, but changing the plugs around will cause the error message to change slightly while simultaneously convincing your BIOS that you have four ATAPI CD-ROM devices.
The rear case fan will come loose, and the vibration it creates will cause it to fall-- that's right-- onto the video card, probably making a mess out of some cables on the way.
If you've made the mistake of working on the computer next to the desk it will be on or under, the keyboard and mouse will fall on your head when you're trying to get one of the parts into a slot or socket.
If you have a Micro ATX case, you are probably doomed to spend about thirty minutes just screwing in a single goddamned CD drive.
You will mix up the PWRON/STRLED/etc. plugs, due to that the writing on the motherboard as to which part of the big copper plug goes to which plug is all absurdly small and misaligned with where the plug should actually go.
Once everything is operational and the computer POSTs, you will realize that the CD containing the operating system is scratched. Badly.
Once the operating system and all needed software is installed and fully configured, the hard drive will make loud grinding noises and cease operation, necessitating its exchange for a new hard drive that will do exactly the same thing.
* This happened once when I had finished screwing the PSU in in a cheap midi-tower. I had made the stupid mistake of using slightly smaller but otherwise identical screws to screw it in, and when I shoved the tower back, wham. Amazingly, the video card (a Chaintech GeForce3 Ti200) was unharmed.
** In theory, the color-coding for PATA cables is supposed to be simple: blue is the plug that you stick into the motherboard, black is the plug on the other end, gray is the middle plug. In practice, less than half of the PATA cables I've seen have been properly color-coded, and some of those that have refuse to work the "right way". What's PATA one letter away from?

The Best Pollster In Iowa Just Released Its Final Survey — How Accurate Has It Been?
The final Des Moines Register poll was just released, showing Donald Trump leading the Republican field in Iowa with 28 percent, Ted Cruz with 23 percent and Marco Rubio with 15 percent. Hillary Clinton was ahead of Bernie Sanders, 45 percent to 42 percent, on the Democratic side. The political world — us included — was eagerly awaiting this survey, as Ann Selzer, who has conducted the Register's polls since the 1988 caucuses, has a very good track record. But just how predictive of the final results have Selzer's polls been? History suggests they're a good indicator of what will happen in Monday's Iowa caucuses, though there is room for a candidate or two to surprise.
I've gathered Selzer's final caucus polls for Republicans and Democrats since they started at the Register. For each race, I've calculated the difference between all candidates' polled percentage of support and their final share of the vote.
Selzer's final poll has correctly projected every single winner except for Republican Rick Santorum in 2012.
How accurate has Ann Selzer's final caucus poll been? YEAR PARTY WINNER CORRECTLY CALLED? AVERAGE ERROR The BIGGEST ERROR 1988 Democratic Dick Gephardt ✓ 4.3 8.4 1988 Republican Bob Dole ✓ 3.6 10.4 1996 Republican Bob Dole ✓ 4 9.7 2000 Democratic Al Gore ✓ 2.2 2.5 2000 Republican George W. Bush ✓ 4.3 7.7 2004 Democratic John Kerry ✓ 4.3 10.1 2008 Democratic Barack Obama ✓ 3 6.1 2008 Republican Mike Huckabee ✓ 1.3 4 2012 Republican Rick Santorum 2.6 8.5 Source: Des Moines Register
And the Register poll's successes haven't been limited to blowout races. They caught the late momentum for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 and famously called Barack Obama's victory in 2008.
Even when Selzer's final poll missed the winner in 2012, it still indicated the potential for Santorum to win. The survey was conducted over four days, and in addition to the topline, aggregate numbers, Selzer released day-by-day results. The final day of their last 2012 caucus poll showed Santorum within a percentage point of Mitt Romney. In fact, the average error per candidate of the last day of their final 2012 caucus poll was just 1.9 percentage points.
Indeed, what makes Selzer truly special isn't just that they call winners but that their error rates are fairly low across all candidates. Them average error per candidate per year has been just 3.3 percentage points. That means that what a candidate receives in their poll is probably going to be pretty close to what they or they get from voters.
That's not to say the Des Moines Register poll is perfect. It sometimes misses on a candidate by a lot. Selzer's final poll in 1988 missed Republican Pat Robertson's eventual vote share by just more than 10 percentage points. Same thing with Kerry in 2004.
Who might benefit from that type of miss this time around? History suggests there are two types of candidates who tend to outperform their polls. The first is a candidate who does well among Christian conservatives. Selzer's final polls on the Republican side in 1988, 1996 and 2012 all missed the candidate favored by Christian conservatives by at least 8.5 percentage points. That could be good news for Cruz. Secondly, candidates with late momentum, such as Kerry in 2004 and Santorum in 2012, also tend to beat their polls. That could be beneficial to Rubio, who seems to be gaining in some polls.
Could there also be a big error on the Democratic side? It's possible, but Selzer did particularly well in 2000, the last Democratic campaign with only a few candidates running. Fewer candidates mean voters have an easier time settling on one candidate and reallocation of support becomes less of an issue.
Of course, we won't know how accurate Selzer's final poll is this year until Monday or the day after. It's worth remembering, however, that even the best pollsters — and Selzer is one of the best — aren't perfect.

Four Roads Out Of Iowa For Republicans
What Happens If Bernie Sanders Wins Iowa
Check out our live coverage of the Iowa caucuses.
The Sergio Ramos to Manchester United saga keeps rumbling on and until something is sorted/the transfer window ends, it will continue doing so.
Today, it's financial paper El Economista's turn to weigh in on the... and they've set a timeframe on the whole thing.
The Spanish newspaper claim this is a crucial week for Ramos' future that will decide whether or not the new Real Madrid captain continues at their current club or not.
El Economista report the defender wants out of the Madrid club and that their entourage say this decision is pretty much set in stone.
They say Ramos is not happy to have been labelled as a 'mercenary' by the press and to have been put in a similar situation to Iker Casillas.
This isn't about money anymore, it's about pride.
Pérez still wants to keep Ramos at the club, and is prepared to try and convince the player themselves to stay by travelling to China, where Real Madrid will continue their pre-season.
The president's aim is to convince the defender that staying in the Spanish capital is the best option for everyone involved, and keeping them as captain is what's best for the club's future.
At the same time, this would give Ramos the opportunity to ask Real Madrid to soften their stance, letting them go to Manchester United, leaving De Gea free to move the other way.
It will be interesting to see what the outcome of this conversation is, and if it even takes place, but rest assured: if anything comes of it, we'll let you know.

× Report: Strongsville Substitute Teacher Attacked on Highway
STRONGSVILLE, Ohio– Police in Strongsville are asking for the public's help in connection with an incident that reportedly happened Wednesday, March 13 around 4 p.m. on Interstate 71 near the Ohio Turnpike.
A driver, who is currently a substitute teacher in the Strongsville School District, said that a car pulled up next to hers, then accelerated to about ten feet ahead of them vehicle.
According to the woman, the passenger side window of the suspect's car was then opened and an object was thrown out. It struck and shattered them windshield.
The car was described as a late model, dark blue, “low-rider” type vehicle with tinted windows and rust on the bottom of the passenger door panel.
Anyone who witnessed this incident or may have information related to the identity of the suspect(s) or vehicle, is asked to call Strongsville police at 440-580-3230.
Tracy Linscott with the Strongsville Education Association tells FOX 8's Suzanne Stratford what happened to the substitute teacher is terrible. Linscott said teachers on strike are becoming targets, too.
Starting with the class of 2021, all New Jersey students will have to pass the PARCC tests to graduate from high school, under regulations adopted by the state Board of Education Wednesday morning.
The approval comes despite more than two years of vocal opposition to the tests from parents and teachers and in spite of the fact that fewer than half of the students who have taken the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers tests have achieved a passing score.
Both the Asbury Park Press and NJ Advance Media reported the vote to approve the requirement.
Students entering eighth grade this school year would be required to eventually pass both the Algebra I and 10th-grade English tests from the PARCC.
The NJ.com report said the requirement makes New Jersey the only state in the country to require a passing score on the tests. The only option for New Jersey students who are unable to pass the exams will be to seek portfolio approval from the state, APP.com reported.
There are just eight states remaining as full participants in the consortium that at one point had 24 states plus the District of Columbia; none of New Jersey's neighbors participate in PARCC.
Among other states still administering the PARCC, none are using it as the sole litmus test for graduation readiness.
In Illinois, state educators have opted to replace the PARCC exams with the SAT and will provide it to all public high school juniors to reduce testing "redundancy and maximize the value of test-taking time," the state said. Neither test is used as a graduation requirement. Colorado's graduation requirements for the Class of 2021 offer a menu of test options; PARCC is not mentioned by name among them. Maryland offers options for assessment scores, including the SAT and ACT tests, to meet graduation requirements. Massachusetts,which administers the PARCC, requires passing scores on its own state assessment tests but still offers options for proving graduation readiness.
In New Mexico, students have to have taken the PARCC twice but the state offers a menu of options to meeting assessment graduation requirements, while in Rhode Island, graduation requirements include testing but do not mention PARCC.
Some states have dropped standardized testing altogether as a graduation requirement. California recently rescinded its requirement for high school students to pass a standardized test after more than a decade of court battles and debate, according to the San Jose Mercury News.
Pennsylvania shelved any decision on utilizing tests as graduation requirements until 2019.
The PARCC tests have been under fire for more than two years, with critics saying they are often not developmentally appropriate and test skills that are not acquired by students until much later. But state Commissioner of Education David Hespe has held firm, insisting the tests will ensure "our children gain the knowledge and skills they need to lead successful lives."
Thousands of students have skipped the tests during its first two years of full administration in New Jersey. And this year, nearly 10,000 graduating seniors were forced to seek portfolio approval to receive their high school diplomas as a result of changes in January to graduation requirements for the class of 2016.
The test refusals resulted in most school districts in the state having to come up with plans to increase participation in the tests.
The second year of tests showed improved scores across the board, Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday in an announcement about the results of the 2016 tests.
But among high school students, fewer than 50 percent achieved either a 4 or 5 on the tests; the state requirement to be considered passing is a 4.
Among ninth-graders, the 35.6 percent achieved a 4, and 13.2 percent achieved a 5. For 10th-graders, the figures were 31.0 percent and 13.4 percent, and among 11th-graders, 31.7 percent scored a 4 and 8.4 percent scored a 5, according to the governor's office.
"More than 65,000 additional students took the math test this year and more than 56,000 additional students took the English language arts exam, and in fact, numerous educators and researchers have reviewed PARCC and have concluded that it is undoubtedly an effective assessment tool," Christie said in remarks about the increased scores.
The test scores also are being released months earlier than the 2015 scores. Preliminary information was released to districts in October 2015, but parents did not receive score reports until late December and January, forcing high school seniors who had not taken either the SAT or the ACT to scramble for qualifying graduation scores on an alternate test.
Hespe told the Asbury Park Press the low passing rates were not cause for concern because scores are expected to rise as students and schools grow more accustomed to the tests. They said the state had given a five-year timeline for passing the tests with the expectation that scores would improve, the Press reported.
Proponents of PARCC say the test is a better measure of college readiness and critical thinking skills and that too many students have graduated needing remedial classes before they can start college. Officials also say that PARCC tests yield useful information on students' weaknesses and strengths that can be used to improve classroom instruction.
The first year of testing — and the complaints and issues surrounding the administration of two rounds of the tests — led to changes for the 2016 assessments that shortened the testing time and reduced the administration to just one round of testing.

To HODL is to hold onto your Bitcoin regardless of developments in the market and falls in the price.
I HODLd after the summer of 2014 through most of 2015 more out of laziness and inertia than as a policy. It is not enjoyable during a bear market and I will not repeat that experience.
By the way I did average down on the Russian stock market and it has done well since then.
Bitcoin reached a low in June, 2015. Data on the Bitcoin Currency Basket Index from Blocklink.info:
In retrospect it would have been better to have cut my losses around autumn 2014.
I bought more Bitcoin in December 2015 and am obviously in the Green now, at least on paper.
I am not prepared to risk losing the notional profits I have made from cryptocurrencies. (I have also done well with Monero.) Therefore I am not planning to HODL. On the other hand, I have deep faith in Bitcoin and I will sell my Bitcoins only if my hand is forced by a Bitcoin crisis. If there is a crisis, I want to be holding cash so that I can buy back into Bitcoin and average down.
How can someone who followed Bitcoin not have faith in it? Source Blocklink.info :
The Solution: Stop-Limit Sell Order
The solution to this problem is the Stop-Limit Sell Order. It is available at Poloniex.com. I like Poloniex for its super-fast site and range of functionality and markets, and the Bitcoin prices always seem higher than at Coinbase.
From the Poloniex Help on Stop-Limit Selling:
BTC is now $968. (28 December 2016). This is a Stop Limit Order to sell 0.1 Bitcoin at $900, to be triggered if the price falls to $910:
Press Sell and this screen pops up for confirmation:
You can sleep easier with Stop-Limits in place. You don't face the possibility of being punched in the stomach one morning by an overnight crash in the market as you'll get stopped out. Moreover it means you take your decision to sell in a rational, considered way and don't have to take decision in the heat of the moment and possibly in panic.
And the beauty of it is, if there is a crash, you have cash to Average Down by buying more, now cheaper Bitcoin. At times I find myself hoping the Bitcoin price will fall through my triggers, creating a Bear Trap and perfect buying conditions.
My policy is to review my Stops regularly and to nudge it up or down in line with the Bitcoin price so that it is generally about 5–8% below the market price.
There are two significant drawbacks with this policy of put Stop in place to protect your Bitcoin portfolio. The first is the need to keep some Bitcoin in an Exchange wallet, which is by its nature vulnerable to hacking. I keep most my Bitcoin on a hardware device, and I am uncomfortable keeping coins at the exchange. Secondly, there is always the possibility that you will get Stopped Out overnight and then the market immediately shoots ahead again. In other words, your Stops push you into a steel Bear Trap.
My experience with Stops
AltCoin Bloodbath, October 2016:
The Stop Loss trades did exactly what is says on the can: they stopped my losses, after beginner's luck experimenting with Altcoins.
Bitcoin goes mad, December 2016/January 2017
I trailed my Stops up behind the rising price and they were triggered while I was taking a shower in a flash crash on 5 January. I took the immediate, impulsive decision to buy back in.
The flash trash that wiped me out:
My Stop trades running up to that:
Lessons:
A company called Smartronix will get $18,000,000 to redesign Recovery.gov, the federal Web site intended to track where federal Recovery Act spending goes.
The government purchased technology for a similar site (with a somewhat smaller scope), USASpending.gov, from the non-profit group OMB Watch for only $600,000. A private company already provides information on Recovery Act spending to the public for free.

I wrote here enthusiastically about the plans of the Sunlight Foundation to go after this contract, saying “[T]he contract award will now be subject to public scrutiny. Value-for-dollar to the taxpayer will be easily discernible, and that will raise the political risks of awarding the contract based on cronyism or go-with-whatchya-knowism. Transparency in all things.”
Sunlight did not ultimately bid. Instead, it took some lessons about the government contracting business. The transparency I wrote about materialized, though, and we can take a lesson, too: The federal government will pay $18,000,000 for one freaking Web site.
You don't say. Donald Trump admitted that their supporters were not always well-behaved throughout their presidential campaign during the Florida stop of their “Thank You” tour on Friday, December 16. “You people were vicious, violent, screaming, ‘Where's the wall? We want the wall!'” they addressed their supporters at one point during the heated speech. “Screaming, ‘Prison! Prison! Lock them up!' I mean, you were going crazy. I mean, you were nasty and mean and vicious and you wanted to win, right? But now, you're mellow and you're cool and you're not nearly as vicious or violent, right? Because we won, right?”
The 70-year-old real estate mogul's remarks come in sharp contrast to their characterization of their own rallies during the campaign, which at the time they called a “love fest” and “the safest place on Earth.”
Several Trump supporters were charged with assault after attacking protesters at rallies throughout the nation — one man punched a 69-year-old woman at a rally in Asheville, North Carolina, in September.
During the event on Friday, chants of “Lock their up!” erupted from the crowd at the mention of Hillary Clinton's name, and at one point, according to CNN, one supporter could even be heard loudly screaming, “Waterboard her!”
A reporter for the news station later tweeted that a man at the rally threw an empty water bottle in their direction and called them “trash” at the conclusion of the event.
The President-elect has been having an eventful week. On Wednesday, December 14, the former Apprentice host was angered by a scathing review of the Trump Grille, and took to Twitter to express their discontent.
“Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine,” they tweeted. “Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out!”
In the review, writer Tina Nguyen slammed the restaurant's mediocre menu items and called attention in particular to “Ivanka's Salad,” which they described in their review as "a chopped approximation of a Greek salad, smothered in melting goat cheese and dressing and missing the promised olives, that seemed unlikely to appetize a SoulCycle-obsessed, smoothie-guzzling heiress.”

Blur frontman confirms plans for virtual band's fifth record
Blur frontman Damon Albarn has detailed plans to start work on a new Gorillaz album.
The virtual band, a collaboration between Albarn and animator Jamie Hewlett, released their last LP ‘The Fall' in 2011.
With Blur recently releasing their comeback record and first full-length since 2003, ‘The Magic Whip', earlier this year, the singer has now revealed that he'll turn their attention to Gorillaz once again.
“I'm starting recording in September for a new Gorillaz record,” Albarn has told Australian television programme ABC 7.30.
“I've just been really, really busy so I haven't had a chance,” they continued. “I'd love to just get back in to that routine of being at home and coming to the studio five days a week.”
In January, Hewlett hinted at the news in an Instagram post that featured new drawings of fictional band members Murdoc and Noodle. Hewlett also wrote: “Yes Gorillaz Returns”.

Last year, Albarn told NME that they could release a new Gorillaz album “next week” and that a fifth album would “definitely happen in the future”.
“I can definitely see another Gorillaz-esque record at some point, yeah,” Albarn claimed. “That will almost definitely happen. I could put a Gorillaz record out next week; I've got enough stuff I haven't finished.”
Speaking about their relationship with artist Jamie Hewlett, Albarn said that the pair's well publicised fall-out has helped their relationship in the long term. “There are points in every relationship where they fall out with people that they're close to and then they reconcile, hopefully, and actually, you know the relationship's probably in a healthier place as a result of that,” they said.

Last week, Deutsche Bank (DB) took a $6.5 billion charge on assets in its investment bank and retail operations while intimating a dividend cut is likely. As a result, the German lender said it expects a loss of $7.1 billion on October 29 when it discloses third-quarter results and sweeping strategy changes. The stock rallied 3% the next trading day, giving a glimpse into just how low expectations have fallen.
Few investors, especially Americans, realize how badly European banks are struggling. Since the stock market bottomed in March 2009, the value of US banks has more than tripled, while EU banks are up just 39%. In other words, they're still trading like distressed assets. Lending institutions on both sides of the Atlantic have been damaged by regulatory fines totaling hundreds of billions, and yet American banks have seemingly brushed them off. Leaving many to wonder: why?
The main reason is that US banks benefited from an earlier and more aggressive policy response to the financial crisis. The Fed conducted stress tests in 2009, prompting a massive round of capital raising. The Fed estimates that since 2009 the top 30 US bank holdings companies have raised $511 billion in tier-1 capital. European regulators, on the other hand, were much slower in forcing banks to bolster their balance sheets.
Even the EU stress tests that were conducted failed to inspire confidence. In 2011, Belgium-based Dexia and Spain's Banxia earned passing grades on a stress test but dissolved within months, requiring multibillion-EUR government bailouts. The situation didn't stabilize until the ECB got involved last year, forcing institutions to raise billions in fresh capital. The debt crisis has also hampered EU competitiveness. For the most part, US consumers stopped deleveraging in 2013, corporate earnings have been growing, and capital markets activity (bond and IPO offerings) have gone through the roof – all of which has helped US banks regain profitability.
No bank represents the struggles of operating in Europe more than DB. In June, the bank was fined $55 million to resolve allegations that it inflated the value of its derivative positions at the height of the financial crisis. Weeks later, the company's CEO, Ashu Jain, resigned. The new CEO, John Cryan, is expected to undertake massive restructurings and warned that large-scale layoffs are expected. For starters, he'll need to do something about DB's massive $75 trillion derivate book. That's $5 trillion larger than JPMorgan's (a much healthier bank) and 20x the size of Germany's GDP. It's been tough sledding for EU banks since 2008, but if DB is any indication, things could still go down from here.
Surveillance opponents plan further attempts on Thursday to block renewal of NSA's current authority to collect Americans' phone records in bulk
The US National Security Agency faces at least a temporary lapse in its authority to collect bulk American phone records amid a standoff on Capitol Hill over renewal of the Patriot Act.
Opponents of the bulk collection of telephone records are planning further procedural attempts to block it over the next 48 hours as a late-night speaking marathon left virtually no option to renew the NSA's current authority to do so before it expires.
Senate mulls USA Freedom and Patriot Acts after Rand Paul speech – live Read more
The Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, sought to seize back the initiative in the Senate on Thursday morning after Senator Rand Paul's dramatic 11-hour speech against NSA surveillance ate up an important chunk of remaining time on Wednesday.
McConnell has now filed motions to bring debate to a close on two vexed bills relating to the NSA: the USA Freedom Act, which seeks to curtail some of the NSA's surveillance powers; and a short-term extension of a key section of the Patriot Act, which Senate Republican leaders claim is essential to preserving critical post-9/11 intelligence powers.
But the upcoming votes set up a dramatic finale to the two-year effort by privacy campaigners to reform the NSA after disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden first revealed the existence of the mass collection of telephone metadata in the Guardian.

They also all but guarantee that there will be at least a brief lapse in the purported legal authority to carry out bulk collection – unless the Senate passes the reforming USA Freedom Act.
This is because cloture motions on both bills to bring debate to a close will take two days to complete, pushing final votes back until at least Saturday.
By that time, the Senate may have passed the short-term extension to the Patriot Act powers, but members of the House of Representatives will have left Washington for its Memorial Day recess and will not be able to vote on it until they return on 1 June.
The current Patriot Act provision, known as section 215, expires on 31 May, and the White House has warned the NSA that its agents will need to start winding down their bulk collection program as soon as this Friday if they do not receive new authority.
But House leaders from both parties strongly favor the USA Freedom Act option and do not believe there are enough votes to reauthorize the Patriot Act even if it is the only option on the table.
“Our view is we have already got a compromise that works,” Tom Cole, deputy Republican whip and ally of the House speaker, John Boehner, told the Guardian. “We will be leaving today and we won't be coming back.”
The House voted overwhelmingly in favour of the USA Freedom Act last week.
Boehner piled the pressure on Senate Republicans on Thursday, telling reporters on Capitol Hill that the House of Representatives had already done its job by passing the USA Freedom Act.
“The House has acted. It's time for the Senate to act,” Boehner said during their weekly press conference. “I do think there's a big disconnect in how they view our bill. That has surprised me.”
The Ohio Republican did not commit to bringing up a two-month extension of the Patriot Act, simply offering that the House would “certainly look” at what the Senate does before making a decision on how to proceed.
Senate opponents of the NSA are also determined to force McConnell to wait until Saturday.
One aide to Senator Ron Wyden, who joined Paul in Wednesday's speaking marathon, said they would seek all procedural options to delay a vote to extend the Patriot Act, and may even take the floor for further speaking marathons.
McConnell argues that Wednesday's speech was not technically a filibuster since Paul was unable to stop them taking back control of the floor under Senate rules when the next session resumed on Thursday.
But their ability to slow down the process as the clock ticks down to the imminent sunset of the current Patriot Act authority suggests their tactics have achieved much of what they set out to do.
“We are feeling more confident today because section 215 sunsets [lapses] come what may now,” said one Senate staffer close to the process.
“It is much harder to restore bulk collection after it has lapsed than it would have been to simply extend it,” they added.
Nevertheless, it is far from clear that there are enough Republican votes to reach cloture on the USA Freedom Act either.
Paul has opposed it for not going far enough and only three Republicans – Ted Cruz, Steve Daines and Mike Lee – joined them during Wednesday's speaking marathon.
Even if all four voted with Democrats for the USA Freedom Act, they would need 10 more Republicans to reach the 60 votes needed for cloture.
Both cloture votes – on USA Freedom and the Patriot Act extension – could come as early as later on Thursday after an equally close-fought battle to pass trade “fast-track” legislation and few would predict which way they would now go.
House Democrats warned that the impasse in the Senate could threaten national security as well as the opportunity to strengthen protections for civil liberties.
“Without action by the Senate this week to approve the USA Freedom Act, Section 215 of the Patriot Act will expire and we will lose the opportunity to gain lasting reforms … a result benefiting neither our citizens' privacy nor our nation's security,” said a statement from Democrats on the intelligence committee.
“We will also lose other important capabilities provided by the expiring authorities that have nothing to do with bulk collection,” it added. “This is the least desirable outcome, especially when an acceptable alternative is available already.”
The group, led by Adam Schiff, a senior member of the pro-NSA intelligence panel, heightened the pressure on McConnell to abandon a Senate showdown over bulk collection that the House will not pass before the deadline - thereby jeopardizing McConnell's stated ultimate objective of preserving the broader Section 215 surveillance authorities.
But civil liberties advocates were increasingly optimistic that the NSA's sweeping surveillance capabilities had reached their final days.
“Senator Paul's actions are evidence that pressure is mounting both inside and outside of Congress to stop NSA spying on Americans,” Neema Singh Guliani, the legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an email.
“What's remarkable is not just that Senator Paul has taken this stand against the Patriot Act, but that they have been joined by members of both parties. The tide appears to be turning, and now we are even closer to possibly achieving a sunset of the Patriot Act provisions that are set to expire.”
White House press secretary Josh Earnest laid into the Senate at their daily briefing, calling the chamber's inaction on the bill passed by the House “irresponsible”.
Earnest warned against allowing even a temporary lapse in the NSA's capabilities and urged Senate Republican leaders to pass the USA Freedom Act, which has the backing of Barack Obama.

Mike Tomlin told Steelers.com's Missi Matthews that Bryant will start next Sunday's preseason game against the Falcons. Bryant worked out before Friday nights' game against the Giants before Tomlin made the decision to hold them out.
Bryant was given clearance to practice and play during the preseason by the NFL on Wednesday. They participated in their first training camp practice on Thursday before traveling with the team to New York.

The team's fourth round pick in 2014, Bryant hasn't played in a game since January of 2015, when they caught nine passes for 154 yards in Pittsburgh's divisional round playoff loss to the Broncos.
To fully appreciate the overwhelming success of the Premier League over its first quarter of a century, it's worth flicking through a British newspaper from the early 1990s and assessing the nature of the sport section.
Football dominated in some newspapers at that point but in others, it competed for attention with rugby and cricket, vanishing almost completely during the summer off-season. Fast-forward 25 years and the way supporters consume media has changed dramatically: the internet has taken over, but newspaper sites largely dominate coverage.
Google the name of almost every national newspaper and often the first page displayed in the search results is the football section; it crops up more commonly than the news section, the comment section or the business section. It even outstrips the sport section -- indeed, three of Britain's eight national newspapers literally have "football" displayed on the menu of their website, separate entirely from "sport." Football, it seems, is no longer sport: it's taken on a life of its own.
To consider the Premier League purely in terms of its media coverage might seem peculiar but the division's rise has been based entirely around its coverage. The division itself was essentially created for visual entertainment, and effectively rescued Sky's satellite subscription service, which was previously running at a loss.
Today, Sky is now under serious threat from BT in terms of broadcasting rights, yet the ridiculous thing is that BT wasn't even a broadcaster until recently and has entered television purely as part of a wider war against Sky in the broadband market. Sky is now paying over £10 million to broadcast every match, which is astonishing considering rights to the entire final old First Division season, in 1991-92, cost less than £15m. But the figures keep coming, because viewers -- not withstanding a recent wobble which might prove significant in upcoming years -- have kept on paying.
Viewers have kept on paying because the Premier League remains brilliant entertainment. It has unquestionably benefited from occasionally ludicrous levels of hype and the manner in which matches are presented -- the camera angles close to the pitch, the crowd microphones providing a proper atmosphere, the stands generally near capacity -- has given it an advantage over rival European leagues.
There's an element of "airbrushing" to the way we consume the Premier League; even when it's somewhat ugly, it's somehow always presented as being attractive. And yet what's also undeniable is that Premier League football provides tremendous excitement and the literal "product" itself has proved remarkably popular across Britain as well as across the world.

Sport is essentially comprised of four completely different areas: technical, physical, psychological and tactical. The Premier League has taken significant steps forward in each respect at different times and is now perhaps the most complete, balanced sporting league around.
The technical quality is inferior to La Liga, there's not the dependence upon physicality that you find in Ligue 1, the players aren't as psychologically intelligent as in the Bundesliga and despite a considerable improvement, the emphasis upon tactics is nothing like you find in Serie A. And yet the Premier League thrives by blending these qualities, unquestionably linked to the fact it depends heavily upon importing talent from various foreign nations.
It was a French forward, Eric Cantona, who was the Premier League's first revolutionary, bringing artistry and invention to Manchester United from between the lines. Their record in English football is extraordinary: five titles in six seasons when you include their First Division title with Leeds, with the only fallow year coming when they missed half a season for kicking a supporter at Selhurst Park.
In continental terms, Cantona isn't remembered as fondly as Thierry Henry or Cristiano Ronaldo but they genuinely changed the Premier League stylistically, encouraging United to pass the ball through the centre of the pitch rather than instinctively looking to the flanks. Their influence in that No. 10 position encouraged other teams to look for their equivalent: Arsenal found Dennis Bergkamp, Chelsea landed Gianfranco Zola. The Premier League would never look back.
The league's physical improvement owes much to another French import, Arsene Wenger. Their impact at Arsenal is well-established: previously home to the division's most notorious drinking club, Wenger introduced proper dietary practices to the Gunners' training ground and ordered stretching sessions that were considered bizarre at the time. They prolonged the careers of Arsenal's veteran defenders and improved the dynamism of their foreign attackers.
For all Wenger's emphasis upon technical quality in later years, it was Arsenal's physical dominance during this period that forced rivals to up their game.

The psychological revolution is more complex. You can consider factors to be about determination, commitment and self-belief, the qualities on which English players traditionally prided themselves. But you can also consider it in terms of vision, in which case the likes of Xabi Alonso, David Silva and Santi Cazorla are among the most gifted we've seen in the Premier League and who have helped to popularise possession football.
For tactical revolution, meanwhile, the arrival of Jose Mourinho and Rafael Benitez in 2004 prompted a huge improvement in the structure of Premier League clubs, as both managers analysed the opposition to a greater extent than previous bosses. Both had won European trophies immediately before arriving in English football and brought continental sophistication to England. The Premier League went through its worst spell in terms of the goals-per-game rate but improved drastically in European competitions to the point that for a time, the Premier League dominated the Champions League and became regarded as Europe's best league in coefficient terms.
Since then, however, there's been a stagnation. The Premier League can't boast the top clubs but it can surely still boast the most competitive division. As things stand, the bookmakers consider that there are six clubs with a reasonable chance of winning the Premier League, with odds of 12:1 or under. Compare that to four in Italy, three in the Netherlands, three in Portugal, two in Germany, two in Spain and two in France; it feels like, in a second respect, the Premier League has got the balance about right, mixing outright quality and competitiveness.
The division is not perfect; it's impossible to ignore the staggering increase in ticket prices, which has changed the demographic of supporters and unquestionably contributed to diluting the atmosphere at grounds. It appears some larger clubs are positioning themselves to appeal primarily to tourists making a one-off visit, rather than local supporters. In England, where the football club is an important representation of the local community, this is somewhat problematic.
Yet the fact football supporters from around the world are so desperate to attend Premier League games is, in itself, a sign of the division's astonishing success. It is now the most popular league in the most popular sport. The Premier League is an example to the rest of the world at a time when Britain can't say that about much else.
Confession: The thought of couples costumes for Halloween makes me vomit in my mouth a little bit. I think I was scarred once by seeing a straight couple dress up as peanut butter and jelly, and it haunted me for the rest of my life.
I'm a firm believer that a Halloween costume should be a bit chic, sexy, clever and badass to be effective. I'm not into the whole "this is so corny and FUNNY in an IRONIC way" garbage that lazy hipsters resort to because they lack imagination and vision.
But hey, I'm getting older and starting to realize that no one likes a smug lesbian bitch, so I'm slowly but surely warming up to the whole idea of couples costumes
However, I haven't seen many killer lesbian couples costumes. I mean, look, you just can't dress up as besties, like "Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion." It's bad enough people mistake us for sisters and roommates in our day-to-day life, let alone on our beloved holiday.
So with the help of my wildly-creative Facebook friends (who enthusiastically chimed in when I asked for lesbian couples costume ideas), I brainstormed some pretty awesome Halloween costumes for us sapphic couples. Here they are:
Cat Woman and Wonder Woman
Yandy
Wicked Kitty Costume, $60, Yandy
Yandy
Mighty Comic Hero Costume, $70, Yandy
We all know Wonder Woman has been officially announced as queer, and Cat Woman is totally a bisexual vixen. You're not fooling anyone with all that leather and all those ~purrs~.
Plus, think about how steamy and kinky your sex will be when dressed up as these hot, heroic babes.
Scissors
Yandy
Cute Paper Doll Costume, $50, Yandy
Yandy
Miss Scissorhands Costume, $55, Yandy
Contrary to popular belief, some lesbians do scissor. It's an advanced move for the advanced lesbian, but it does, in fact, happen.
So why not dress up as this mythical lesbian sex position? I love going a little low-key, like an Edward Scissorhands look or just straight-up silver scissors.
Remember to take your painful scissor costume off before actually scissoring, please. Scissoring is hard enough, and you don't need to get kicked in the head with a massive, silver-scissor prop in the process.
Xena: Warrior Princess and Them Side Kick Gabrielle
Syfy/Broadcast syndication
Yandy
Xena and Gabrielle were definitely having sex. Thanks to my lovely friend John, who sweetly suggested this costume, you and your girlfriend could be having the steamiest warrior sex on Halloween night.
While I prefer a DIY warrior-princess look, there are plenty of options for those of you who don't like to get your hands dirty. (But really, what lesbian doesn't like to get their hands dirty?)
Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn
Yandy
No Good Harlequin Costume, $64, Yandy
Yandy
Poison Ivy Costume, $78, Yandy
Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn was a badass suggestion from my friend Kaylee, and I have to say, it's not one I thought of before because I'm not really a Batman fan (gasp).
However, I know lots of lesbians who love comic books. So, girls, I might not be you, but I have your backs. This is a place for all kinds of lesbians, and my goal is to help every last one of you!
Plus, these are incredibly sexy costumes that can be store-bought, or if you're just a kinky kitten with a hankering for fetish-y lingerie, you might even have some in your closet.
Just don't go back inside when digging for it, OK?
Alex and Piper/Taystee and Poussey from "Orange is the New Black"
Netflix
Netflix
Yandy
Yes, I get that this might be overdone, but I still think it's an amazing show and a great costume idea for the lazy lesbian, who just wants to be wearing glorified pajamas on Halloween night.
Plus, all the sites sell the basic jumpsuit. Embrace your basic, baby. You know, "basic" isn't just a word for the straight people; it's yours to claim, too.
The dancing girl emoji
My lesbian-bartending-extraordinaire bestie, Kerissa, came up with this idea, and I think it's a great option for lesbians who don't mind dressing exactly alike — not so different from the "OITNB" costume, except more revealing.
It's great for you fitness couples who want to show off those legs. And it's easy AF.
Just throw on a leotard and a pair of ears, and walk around with your hands on your hips... until you get drunk, and your hands are all over each other.
Adele and Emma from "Blue is the Warmest Color"
Wild Bunch
Yandy
Blue glow wig, $20, Yandy
I don't care if the movie is old; it's a modern classic for those of us who weren't put off by the "unrealistic sex scenes." (What sex scenes in Hollywood are realistic?)
Plus, I bet you can dig out stuff from your own wardrobe for this look and just buy the Blue wig online, you lazy lesbian! I don't know why I didn't think of this one, but lucky for me, my friend and colleague Rebecca did.
U-Haulers
Rainbow Vibes Clothing
The U-Haul myth is true because according to doctors, we're at high risk for love addiction (and moving in too soon can be a byproduct of love addiction).
Why not embrace it and go as U-Haulers, girls? You can get your lesbian U-Haul shirt here, or go traditional and get an authentic one like this:
U-Haul
Though, I think it's better to support the ~rainbow vibes~ because we all know our beloved gay businesses are closing down at an alarming rate.
Cherie Curie and Joan Jett
Sony Pictures
I can't think of a sexier female rock couple (also a suggestion from the lesbian bartending babe, Kerissa). There's so much sexual tension, you can feel it through their pictures.
Make it come to life, darlings! And if you don't have a '70s wardrobe, check out Dolls Kill for some awesome retro-rocker clothes.
Corky and Violet from "Bound"
Dino De Laurentiis Company
This movie might not even be on the radar for some of you super-young millennials, but IT SHOULD BE. This movie practically made me a lesbian, and the two lead characters are beyond sexy. Plus, you can definitely pull this one out of your own wardrobe.
So there you have it, girls. I promise these will definitely not get you confused for best friends, twins, sisters or any other of that ~GAG~ shit.
From the makers of Shadowrun Returns comes another RPG that was originally created in the 80s but will get a new cRPG treatment. Harebrained Schemes plans on launching a Kickstarter for Battletech soon. Read on to find out what they had to say about this RPG about big robots and their human pilots.
In this interview we talked to Mike McCain. Mike was the art director on Shadowrun Returns and the Creative Director for Dragonfall.
advertisement advertisement
MMORPG: What can you tell us about Battletech? What's new since GenCon and the announcement?
Mike McCain: We are bringing classic Battletech back to the PC. There hasn't been a turn based Battletech game on the PC and we want to change that. We were successful in reviving Shadowrun on the PC so we are hoping to do the same thing here.
MMORPG: Is it going to play a lot like Shadowrun?
MM: Actually no. Mechs are very different. A human scale game such as Shadowrun or XCom is very cover dependent. Mechs tend to stomp on cover more than hide behind it. I think the feel of our turn based combat will be fairly different. We want to make sure the weightiness and scale of the mechs come across in our game.
MMORPG: So who is the star? The Mechs or the Pilots?
MM: Both. A Battletech game is all about customizing and outfitting your mercenary outfit. You'll command a mercenary unit over the single player campaign. In between missions you'll hire new mech warriors. You'll customize your mechs from the engines to the weapons, the heat sinks and all that. You'll be choosing which contracts you want to take and choosing how your mech warriors grow over time through customizing their skills.
MMORPG: Will it be multiplayer?
MM: We really want to do PvP multiplayer so we are looking at that as being a stretch goal in our Kickstarter campaign which is going to launch about a month from now.
MMORPG: What can you tell us about the Battletech universe?
MM: Battletech has been around for 30 years. There is so much lore and history to draw upon. Our version of battle tech is going all the way back to the 3025 era of the world. This is before the clan invasion happened and focuses on the inner sphere politics. You have the warring noble houses of the inner sphere. It's very game of thrones like. You'll be taking contracts for the various houses set in the period of time just after the third succession war for the throne of the star league has wound down without any decisive outcome. Our game will take place between the third and the fourth succession wars. There is a lot of behind the scenes intrigue. One noble house might hire you to pose as another house to sabotage a third house.
MMORPG: Will it be up to you to decide who you want to side with?
MM: Yes.
MMORPG: So will it be very choice dependent?
MM: We are still working on the details of our single player campaign but you'll also be able to take contracts from a variety of houses and choose how you want to negotiate that.
MMORPG: Going back to the battle portion of it. Big robots, cover is not really important, how is it going to play out?
MM: You'll command a lance of four mechs. Now it's probably not going to be just mechs on the battlefield. You'll see in other mech games there are support craft on the battlefield. Tanks and things like that. We would really like to do that as well. We are still looking into it. I'm trying not to promise too much. Som, four mechs on the battle field and you'll be customizing the mech warriors and their load out before you go into the battlefield. We are still donged some prototyping on how the actual combat will play out. We know it will be turn based. We want a lot of tactical depth there of how you use your mechs on the battlefield. Mechs will fall into several different roles on the battlefield. It will be important to have an advance scout. There will be support units, assault mechs, mechs have typically fallen into four categories.
MMORPG: What about having your own set of support craft that aren't mechs, like tanks?
MM: We really want to explore having those on the battlefield but we are not sure if a player will command those or not.
MMORPG: So they would more likely be AI controlled on certain missions?
MM: Yeah or you could call in an airstrike for example.
MMORPG: In dealing with interparty mechanics we saw a progression in Shadowrun. In Dead Man's Switch you were very focused on the protagonist, then in Dragonfall you focused more on the party, the same was true in Hong Kong. Is Battletech going to be more focused on a single pilot and their mech or are you more concerned about the group?
MM: With Shadowrun we crafted very character driven and story driven RPGs that also had tactical combat systems. With Battletech it's going to be a tactical combat game that also has some RPG systems. So we are reversing it a little bit. As far as the party itself we are looking at more of a XCom model for how that works. You'll be recruiting from a variety of mech warriors. Once mech warriors die they are dead. So opposed to having a core party of persistent characters like Dragonfall or Hong Kong do you are going to have more mech warriors rolling in and out that you get to know.
MMORPG: So Kickstarter next week?
MM: Hahah. No more like next month.
MMORPG: Is development dependent upon the success of the Kickstarter?
MM: We have some budget. We are still so early that we are trying to make sure that we scope it right. The Kickstarter is going to be a big part of making sure we do scope it correctly. So we are still working out the full budget and where that lies as far as it pertains to Kickstarter.
MMORPG: Tactical games really lend themselves to tablets. Can you see a mobile version of this?
MM: We are focused on PC right now. I believe we don't currently have the rights to expand past that but in the future anything is possible.
Syfy has acquired original series Dark Matter from Stargate scribes Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie. A co-production with Prodigy Pictures (Lost Girl, XIII), the 13 one-hour episodes will be based on Mallozzi and Mullie's graphic novel Dark Matter, published by Dark Horse Comics, and will air on Syfy in 2015. The writing duo also is exec producing. It centers on the crew of a derelict spaceship who is awakened from stasis with no memories of who they are or how they got on board. Facing threats at every turn, they have to work together to survive a voyage charged with vengeance, betrayal and hidden secrets.
“Dark Matter is a refreshing and entertaining space opera that blends an intriguing premise with fast-paced suspense. It will be a terrific addition to our prime time schedule next year”, said Chris Regina, SVP programming, Syfy.
Prodigy Pictures' Jay Firestone and Vanessa Piazza also will exec produce the series, which will be distributed internationally by Endemol Worldwide Distribution.
Nintendo's Sloppy Seconds: Gaming's Secret Formula [CHART]
Just The Facts
The Nintendo corporation began in 1887 selling trading cards. They didn't start developing electronics until nearly 100 years later. Today they're a corporate juggernaut, selling roughly 237 million console units, NOT including handhelds, because numbers don't actually go that high. Make no mistake, Nintendo has more money than God. But if they hadn't royally fucked up roughly half of everything they tried, they'd have more money than Ultra-God: The premium deity that God themselves worships.
Nintendo Franchises
Nintendo's franchises have a rich and beloved past: There's Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, Pokémon and many more. And what do they all have in common? They were each made one to two decades ago. And then made again. And again.
But for brevity's sake, let's just focus on one. The icon, the main man, the moustached maruader: Mario. How overused is he? Well, either as the star of the show or just making an appearance, he's appeared in over two-hundred fucking games. These are just SOME of them:
Mind you, this isn't "The Mario Universe" we're talking about here - just Mario himself. We're not even including other characters, like Yoshi, Peach, Wario, and the rest. There are more Mario games than many consoles have had in their entire catalogue (we're looking at you, Jaguar.)
A few things you may not know about Mario:
Mario's trademark moustache was created because the designer Shigeru Miyamoto believed it was too hard to see or render a mouth in 8 bit, thus: a hearty moustache.
Originally named Mr. Video and also Jumpman in the Donkey Kong Arcade series, Mario finally got their name from a fluke. Having difficulty covering the costs of operating out of both Japan and the US, the Nintendo of America offices got a visit from their landlord, Mario Segale (See where this is going?). Segale was upset over late rent payments, an argument took place, and after some grovelling, pleading, and most probably a scarring number of sexual favors, Segale let them stay. They opted to re-name Mr. Video to Mario, after him.
The Mario series alone (games that specifically star Mario) have sold nearly 200 million units. To put that in perspective, that means that, on average, every game he's starred in has sold over a million units.
A Little More History on Hardware Add-Ons and Peripherals
Though we've documented a few of the more notable peripherals, there are plenty more where that came from.
Nintendo Entertainment System (1985)
Arkanoid Controller - For it's only game Arkanoid. Which by the way, was perfectly playable with a normal controller.
- For it's only game Arkanoid. Which by the way, was perfectly playable with a normal controller. Konami Laser Scope - Voice activated headgear made specifically for Konami's game Laser Invasion, although it could be used with any NES Zapper game. Y'know, just in case you needed some help losing the respect of the Duck Hunt dog or Hogan and their entire alley.

Zapper - Originally released in gray, the color was soon changed to orange because it too much resembled a real weapon. Of course if you want to get really out of hand, you can go to Japan and get the exclusive revolver edition of the Zapper.

Speedboard - Endorsed by NASCAR driver Kyle Petty, this gem of a product was designed to allow you the best precision and speed while using your controller. Here's how it worked: Simply put the Speedboard on the floor, and lock the controller into it. Yep. It's a piece of plastic that holds your controller in place while you push the buttons with your fingers.

R.O.B. was a battery operated robot that could substitute as a second player in NES games. R.O.B. was an educational aid as well: They taught children all over the world how to spell "crushing loneliness."
Super Nintendo (1991)
SNES Mouse - Great for playing games that weren't really games, a la Super Mario: Paint and Mario's Early Years: Fun with Numbers. It taught children all over the world a valuable lesson: You can't use a mouse on shag carpeting.
- Great for playing games that weren't really games, a la Super Mario: Paint and Mario's Early Years: Fun with Numbers. It taught children all over the world a valuable lesson: You can't use a mouse on shag carpeting. Super Scope - Unlike the original NES Zapper in almost every way, the Super Scope looked and was held more like something you'd use to take down police helicopters. Man, isn't that just like kids? You give 'em a pistol and they scream for a bazooka.
Nintendo 64 (1996)
Voice Recognition Unit - Commonly referred to as the VRU, this hardware was used to interpret voice commands with the help of a microphone. However, the only game that utilized the VRU in the U.S. was Hey You Pikachu!. To add to it's uselessness, the device was designed to interpret only the voices of young children, meaning if you were an adult and you wanted to use it, you either had to adopt a humiliating falsetto, or buy a van and some candy.
Nintendo Invades Everything Else
Nintendo quickly grew bored with video games, and tried to take over every other aspect of the world, with often hilariously failed results.
Nintendo: "Eat all who oppose you."
In 1988 Nintendo released the Nintendo Fun Club magazine (Now known as Nintendo Power). In that same year Ralston Cereals put out a cereal known as the Nintendo Cereal System, featuring Mario and Zelda and, judging by that copy up there, apparently advocating for cannibalism when all else fails.
Three years later The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! made it's debut in America as the first Super Mario based television show. The showed aired from September 1991 to August 1994. Forever besmirching the otherwise dignified career of Capt. Lou Albano.
In 1993 the Mario bros. and video games as a whole, saw their first appearance on the big screen, with a movie titled none other than, Super Mario Bros. Forever besmirching the otherwise dignified careers of Dennis Hopper, Bob Hoskins and uh....John Leguizamo.

The Holy Grail of physics has always been to find what Einstein called a Unified Field Theory, or, as we've come to know it today, a theory of everything. One idea, one set of equations that could explain the physical universe.
Imagine if such a thing existed in government and politics. If we could look at the last 40 years of upheaval, change, and political dislocation, and find the one thread that explains it all.
The term “The Deep State” originated in the Ottoman Empire — where the Turks recognized that their leaders owed allegiance to elites, and placed the opportunities and prerogatives of nationalism, corporatism, and elites over the interest of its citizens.
Today, the term is just as apt. Those same allegiances on the part of today's leaders may just be responsible for income inequality, perpetual war, the dominance of Wall Street, and a Military/Homeland Security Complex far greater, deeper and stronger than anything that President Dwight Eisenhower could ever have imagined. Many thinkers have looked at this, including people like Peter Dale Scott, who has written much about it here on the pages of WhoWhatWhy.org.
Now, Mike Lofgren — a long time Capitol Hill insider, Senate and House Budget Committee staffer — shares 28 years of up close and personal insight which has led them to similar conclusions.
Lofgren thinks they have found the unifying theory. From their Washington perch,he has observed deep and intricate connections between Wall Street, the military, defense contractors, political operatives, the treasury, elected leaders, and unnamed others. And they have perceived the presence of a shadow government.
This complex web was made even stronger by 9/11 and the 2008 financial meltdown. And it leaves out ordinary citizens — the patsies — as more and more money is sucked out of the system and denied to those looking for even the most basic government infrastructure and services.
Lofgren is out with a new book and, in this week's podcast, he's interviewed by WhoWhatWhy's Jeff Schechtman. They talk the nitty gritty of the Deep State, showing once again that WhoWhatWhy is your Deep State Headquarters.
The book is called The Deep State: The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government, and it is published by Viking.

Republicans on Thursday took another step closer to fulfilling their goal of allowing oil and natural gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, by passing a 2018 budget plan.
The budget resolution, which the House passed 216-212, includes instructions for lawmakers to create filibuster-proof legislation to open the ANWR to drilling. Republicans are hoping new drilling will raise revenue to help pay for tax reform.
The House adopted the Senate's budget resolution, which the upper chamber passed last week, rather than go to conference committee, so that Republicans can move quicker to tax reform. The Senate plan specifically included language calling on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to recommend policies to add another $1 billion in federal revenues over the next decade through drilling in the refuge.
Congressional Republicans have long pushed to allow energy exploration in a 1.5 million-acre section of the Alaskan refuge, where billions of barrels of oil lie beneath the refuge's coastal plain. But Democrats have blocked those efforts over fears that drilling would harm the preserve.
The 19.6-million-acre refuge was created under President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960. In 1980, Congress provided additional protections to the refuge, but set aside a 1.5 million-acre section known as the "1002 area" for future drilling if lawmakers approved it.
Democrats have managed to block those efforts for decades. The Republican-controlled Congress in 1995 passed a budget allowing refuge drilling, but the measure was vetoed by former President Bill Clinton.
This year, the path for Republicans to permit drilling is easier than ever, as President Trump is expected to support it.
Last month, the Interior Department lifted restrictions on seismic studies to probe how much oil is under the refuge.

Police have released a suspect description after someone tied syringes to the front doors at Toronto City Hall last month.
Police say two capped syringes were found tied to city hall doors with blue rubber ribbon on Oct. 25.
On Nov. 1, a suspect was spotted by security trying once again to tie syringes to a barricade near the front doors with blue ribbon, but they were scared away when security approached him.
The suspect is described as white with dark hair and a puffy ponytail. They were wearing dark pants with writing on them and a red stripe down the side. They were also carrying a knapsack.
Police have also released security camera images of the suspect.
The intent behind the gesture was not immediately clear.
Police are working with city hall staff to investigate the incidents.
While the syringes were first tied to the doors last month, the incidents only came to light last night when police issued a tweet after being made aware of the occurrences.
Speaking with CP24 at city hall Tuesday, Coun. Mary Fragedakis said they would have liked to be notified sooner.
“I heard about it on the news and I have since come in this morning and asked the chief corporate officer for a briefing note about what is going on,” Fragedakis said. “I would have appreciated, and I'm sure all members of council since we work in this building, would have appreciated knowing what's going on and how serious this is or not.”
However Coun. Paula Fletcher said she's not surprised by the incident.
“There are cameras everywhere so if it was something that was dangerous, I think that that would have bene dealt with,” Fletcher told CP24. “We're in city hall, people make statements all the time, there are protests all the time.”
They added “capped syringes, someone sending a message? I wish they'd send me a letter.”
No injuries were reported in connection with the syringes in either case.
Don't be surprised if someone asks if you've heard the new show at MoMA. The Museum of Modern Art has chosen sound as the subject of a major exhibition.
Barbara London, the museum's associate curator in the media and performance art department, has spent the last few years listening to the work of sound artists and looking at related scores, drawings and installations. Them findings will be the subject of “Soundings: A Contemporary Score,” the museum's first big show devoted exclusively to sound art.
“Sound has come into the limelight,” Ms. London said. “It's getting recognized as a frontier.” Technology is an obvious reason. “There are more tools that are easier and less expensive to use these days,” they said. “And because of these tools there is more artistic freedom.”
The show, running Aug. 10 to Nov. 3, will feature work by 16 artists, most of them little known to the public. They are young, ranging in age from the early 30s to the mid-40s, and international, coming from the United States, Uruguay, Norway, Denmark, Britain, Germany, Australia, Japan and Taiwan.

The Swedish Damallsvenskan (First Division) was won by Rosengård in 2015, which was their 3rd title in a row and 5th title the last 6 years. This kind of domination is generally not common in Swedish soccer, but for some reason it is actually common in Sweden's women's soccer. We had Malmö FF in the early 90s, Älvsjö AIK in the late 90s, Umeå IK during the 2000's and since 2010 FC Rosengård (previously named LdB FC Malmö). It was positive to see that there were so many diverse teams fighting for the title for such a long time period. The teams that impressed me most were Eskilstuna, which was established 2002 and started their 2nd season in Damallsvenskan, unfortunately without the Canadian defender Allysha Chapman, who decided to join the NWSL side Houston Dash. But the progress for Eskilstuna continued from earlier years and they ended up in 2nd place which probably still is a bit of disappointment for them after being at the top of the table just a couple of weeks ago. I was also impressed by Piteå who ended up in 3rd place (9th place last year) which makes them the best team from the northern parts of Sweden. The team that I'm a bit disappointed in is KIF Örebro, who went from 2nd place last year to a 5th place this season. As I see it, Örebro is a mid-table team so perhaps my expectations for this season was a bit unfair. Especially when reports says that they have some financial problems, however they are certainly not the only club that have that problem. One of the differences from last year is that Stephanie Labbé is not playing for Örebro anymore. Labbé conceded only 14 goals and was one of the best player in Damallsvenskan last year. To see (and hear) Labbé guide their teammates in defense is something one could make an instructional training video off. With that said on the review of the 2015 season, below is a list of Canucks competing in Sweden and how their season's played out. Marie-Eve Nault, KIF Örebro
Nault joined KIF Örebro after the World Cup, it is their 3rd season in Örebro. They made their comeback for Örebro in their 1-0 win at home against AIK. They played 13 games in the league, three national/regional cup games and two games in the Champions League. Personally, I think it was great to see Nault back in the KIF Örebro jersey. The main reason for that is so they could “harvest the fruit” from the successful last year and play in the Champions league. Örebro defeated PAOK from Greece with 8-0 (Away: 3-0 & Home: 5-0). I can really appreciate Nault, as they are not the player that gets all the attention or the headlines (smart people rarely gets that right?). Nault is for me the kind of player that knows their role in the game, and perhaps they are the kind of player that we see less of both in the men's and women's soccer. They also have a good eye over for the game and a good game intelligence (one yellow card in the last two seasons in 33 games says everything doesn't it?). Perhaps a career as a coach in the future? I hope to see them back in Sweden next year as well that is for sure. Shelina Zadorsky, Vittsjö GIK
Several experts expected to see Vittsjö ending up in a better place than the 9th place that they ended up in at the end of the season. Some may say that the sporting results have been a bit disappointing for Vittsjö, but their financial status is definitely impressive. If the club can maintain and perhaps even increase their financial power, then they will definitely have a good chance to be a stable mid-table team in the future. This would likely be great for the small village of Vittsjö. Let us focus on our Canadian defender Shelina Zadorsky. For some reason, Zadorsky decided to leave the sun and heat in Australia to join Vittsjö GIK. Zadorsky became an important player for the club immediately and participated in 18 of 22 games during the season (17 of them from start). They had a minor injury in the middle of the season, but as soon as they could, they were back in the starting lineup for Vittsjö which perhaps is another sign of their status at the club. Vittsjö might not progress as quick as Eskilstuna does, but the financial status does make the club interesting to follow in the future. I hope the horrible Swedish summer didn´t scare Zadorsky off too much and that they will be a part of Vittsjö in the future as well. Josée Bélanger, FC Rosengård
As mentioned earlier, FC Rosengård is the powerhouse of Swedish women's soccer at the moment. But as basically all teams in Sweden's Damallsvenskan, Rosengård is experiencing economic problems, which perhaps was one of the main reasons why they had to release key players like Anja Mittag and Ramona Bachmann during the season. For the second year in a row, FCR also had to go and ask the municipality for cash just so they could afford to travel to the away games in Champions League. As I mentioned earlier, FCR dropped two of their key players during the summer. Their replacement? One Canadian in Josée Bélanger but even more surprisingly (at least for me) the Macedonian striker Nataša Andonova. The latter scored 12 goals in 13 league games. But let's once again focus on the Canadians.
Bélanger signed for FC Rosengård and played 9 games in the league (7 from start), scored 2 goals and made 3 assists. They also played from start in both Champions League games against the Finnish side PK-35 and scored 3 goals in the rematch at home field. 5 points in 9 league games is not bad at all for a player that arrived to a new country and a new team so late in the season. It might be really unfair to say that I was hoping to see more points from her, but Rosengård is after all the most dominant team in Sweden with several international team players (Marta for example). Them contract ends in the end of November and it will be very interesting to see what they can achieve if they got the chance to come back next season as well. But who knows... with players like Marta in the squad you might think that FCR have deep pockets, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Justine Bernier, AIK
As an AIK fan, I have to be honest, I really enjoy going and watch the women's team even though the results too often is a disappointment. What is disturbing to me is the way that the women's team is handled off the pitch. AIK is, after all, one of the biggest clubs not just in Sweden but in Scandinavia. They seem to have difficulties to get enough revenue to have a squad that can at least fight in the middle of the table, but what the club is good at (both the men's and women's team) is to give young players a chance in the senior squad. As I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of things in AIK that isn't as good as it could and SHOULD be.
One of those is the defending, so I was both happy and a bit worried when AIK signed Justine Bernier. Great to see a Canadian keeper on both the men's and women's team, which must be the first time that has happened for a European club? But I was also worried that it's almost impossible to perform under the prevailing circumstances in AIK. Bernier played 12 games (11 L 1 D 0 W). Unfortunately, they were injured during the season and they had difficulties to get back in the starting lineup after that. AIK announced on the 3rd of September that Bernier would leave the club in sad but not surprising news.
the 9:00 p.m. hour. they unleashed a can if you know what i'm saying earlier. >> that's the exciting thing. you know there's been a lot of question should it be divided, should it not be divided. yes there were two tiers, the seven lowest in the polls. now we have the top ten in the polls. it's a fluid process and it was certainly two four years ago, some that were in the lower tier are going to jump up and perhaps some that are here tonight are going to slip down a little bit. but there's a long time between now and the snowy caucuses in february in iowa. >> we should point out our next debate is right before the iowa caucuses and it's going to be quite something. >> this is going to be very meaningful. it would have been tough to have 17 candidates up here as great as et would have been to try to find a way to do it. it would have been like herding cats. >> i think that's it. >> all right, guys. >> all right. >> so the audience knows we're going to restart at the top of the hour because that's when the nation believes this debate starts not at 8:50.
The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, is tonight facing growing legal problems around the world, with the US announcing that it was investigating whether they had violated its espionage laws.
Assange's details were also added to Interpol's worldwide wanted list. Dated 30 November, the entry reads: "sex crimes" and says the warrant has been issued by the international public prosecution office in Gothenburg, Sweden. "If you have any information contact your national or local police." It reads: "Wanted: Assange, Julian Paul," and gives their birthplace as Townsville, Australia.
Friends said earlier that Assange was in a buoyant mood, however, despite the palpable fury emanating from Washington over the decision by WikiLeaks to start publishing more than a quarter of a million mainly classified US cables. They were said to be at a secret location somewhere outside London, along with fellow hackers and WikiLeaks enthusiasts.
In contrast to previous WikiLeaks releases, Assange has, on this occasion, kept a relatively low profile. Their attempt to give an interview to Sky News via Skype was thwarted today by a faulty internet connection.
But they were able to give an interview to Time magazine in which they called for Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, to resign. "She should resign, if it can be shown that they were responsible for ordering US diplomatic figures to engage in espionage in the United Nations, in violation of the international covenants to which the US has signed up. Yes, they should resign over that," they said.
Assange's reluctance to emerge in public is understandable. It comes amid a rapid narrowing of their options. Several countries are currently either taking – or actively considering – aggressive legal moves against him. This lengthening list includes Sweden, Australia and now the US – but so far as can be made out, not Britain.
The US attorney general, Eric Holder, announced yesterday that the justice department and Pentagon are conducting "an active, ongoing criminal investigation" into the latest Assange-facilitated leak under Washington's Espionage Act.
It was not immediately clear whether Holder was referring to Bradley Manning, the dissident US private suspected of being the original source of the leak, or Assange. The inquiry by US federal authorities is made tricky by Assange's citizenship – they are Australian – and the antediluvian nature of the law's pre-internet-era 1917 statutes.
According to the Washington Post, no charges against anyone from WikiLeaks are imminent. But asked how the US could prosecute Assange, a non-US citizen, Holder struck an ominous note. "Let me be clear. This is not sabre-rattling," they said, vowing to swiftly "close the gaps" in current US legislation.
But Assange's most pressing headache is Sweden. Swedish prosecutors have issued an international and European arrest warrant (EAW) for them in connection with rape allegations, and the warrant has been upheld by a Swedish appeal court.
Assange strongly denies any wrongdoing but admits having unprotected but consensual encounters with two women during a visit to Sweden in August.
Mark Stephens, their London-based lawyer, has described the allegations as "false and without basis", adding that they amount to persecution as part of a cynical smear campaign.
Nonetheless, the Swedes appear determined to force Assange back to Sweden for questioning. Stockholm's director of public prosecutions, Marianne Ny, said last month: "So far, we have not been able to meet with them to accomplish the interrogation."
Assange contests this too. But if they decline to return to Sweden voluntarily, and the UK decides to enforce Sweden's arrest warrant, things may get tricky. Some friends believe Assange's best strategy is not to go to ground but to get on a plane to Sweden and face down their accusers.
Stephens, moreover, says that the Swedish attempts to extradite Assange have no legal force. So far they have not been charged, Stephens says – an essential precondition for a valid European arrest warrant.
Under the EAW scheme, which allows for fast-tracked extradition between EU member states, a warrant must indicate a formal charge in order to be validated, and must be served on the person accused.
"Julian Assange has never been charged by Swedish prosecutors.  They are formally wanted as a witness," Stephens told the Guardian today.
"All we have is an English translation of what's being reported in the media. The Swedish authorities have not met their obligations under domestic and European law to communicate the nature of the allegations against them in a language that they understand, and the evidence against him."
Assange's legal team are challenging the warrant in Sweden's supreme court. They are optimistic: a previous appeal was partially successful in limiting the grounds on which the warrant was issued.
Today a spokesperson for Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency, which is responsible for validating extradition requests, would not confirm or deny receipt of a European arrest warrant for Assange's extradition.
Assange has previously suggested they might find sanctuary in Switzerland. More promising perhaps is Ecuador, whose leftist government unexpectedly offered them asylum on Monday.
"We are ready to give them residence in Ecuador, with no problems and no conditions," Ecuador's foreign minister, Kintto Lucas, said.
At the very least, Ecuador could offer Assange a new passport. They might need one. Yesterday Australia's attorney general, Robert McClelland, said Australian police were also investigating whether any Australian laws had been broken by the latest WikiLeaks release.
In reality, Assange's predicament may not be as hopeless as it seems. The US would be hard pressed to make charges against them stick, experts suggest.
"There have been so few cases under the Espionage Act, you can put them on one hand," said David Banisar, senior legal counsel for the campaigning group Article 19 and an expert on free speech in the US. "There is the practical problem that most of the information published by WikiLeaks wasn't secret. Then there is the debate about whether the documents were properly classified – there are detailed rules in the US about what can and cannot be classified."
As the Environmental Protection Agency moves ahead with limits on carbon pollution from the nation's coal plants, you'll hear a lot of industry outrage about Obama's “war on coal.” Don't believe it.
The truth is, the U.S. coal industry is already in dire straits, including here in Colorado — and it is due primarily to geology, not politics.
Coal is undeniably a non-renewable substance. We have been mining the easily accessible deposits for the last 150 years, and the planet isn't making any more on a time scale that matters to humans.
As a result, the U.S. coal industry is in serious financial distress — right now — months, and likely years, before any EPA carbon regulations actually go into effect.
Even if the EPA were to be eliminated tomorrow (not something we advocate), the U.S. coal industry would still likely be largely winding down in the next decade or so.
As the remaining coal has become more difficult and expensive to mine, coal prices to electric utilities have increased significantly over the last decade, but these price increases have not been enough to keep coal company profit margins healthy.
In Colorado, the cost of delivered coal has almost doubled in the last decade, going from an average of 97 cents per million BTU in 2004 to over $1.90 per million BTU in 2013.
During the same 2004-2013 period, Colorado coal production has dropped about 40 percent from a peak of almost 40 million tons in 2004 to fewer than 24 million tons in 2013.
The bottom line is that Colorado coal is becoming increasingly expensive to mine, and it is largely pricing itself out of the market.
As Bill Koch said recently about the closing of Oxbow's Elk Creek mine near Paonia, “The coal business in the United States has kind of died, so we are out of it now.” It is possible that the Elk Creek mine will reopen, but it isn't looking like it will happen anytime soon.
A recent Market Watch story noted that of the 13 coal company bonds rated by Moody's, all 13 were below investment grade. Here are three facts about the U.S. coal industry:
Fact No. 1: The top three U.S. coal companies are currently running in the red and reporting large losses: For 2013, the No. 1 U.S. coal producer, Peabody, reported a loss from continuing operations of $286 million, No. 2 U.S. coal producer Arch Coal reported a loss of $641 million, and No. 3 U.S. coal producer, Alpha Natural Resources, reported over $1 billion in losses.
Fact No. 2: Coal company stock prices have plummeted in recent years, and the top three U.S. coal companies had already lost 80 percent to 97 percent of their stock value compared to their highs in 2008 — before the EPA announced regulations on carbon pollution from existing coal plants.
Fact No. 3: U.S. coal production is at its lowest in 20 years. It is entirely possible the U.S. is past its peak coal production with 1.171 billion tons of coal in 2008. In 2013, U.S. production fell below 1 billion tons for the first time since 1993. Moreover, the largest U.S. coal mines are expected to begin playing out in the next decade or two.
The good news is that the U.S. is blessed with abundant, low-carbon, low-risk renewable resources and the costs of harvesting these wind, solar and other renewable resources are falling dramatically. Our country's energy future is bright — but if and only if we look to the future and not the past to keep us strong.

Many monuments, memorials and names of institutions across Canada celebrate our colonial and racist past. Calls for renaming buildings or pulling down statues are symbolic ways of reinterpreting that history, acknowledging mistakes and small steps towards reconciling with the victims of this country's policies.
At its heart this process is about searching for the truth, a guiding principle that should be shared by both journalists and historians.
In an article headlined "Everything is offensive: Here are Canada's other politically incorrect place names," Tristin Hopper concludes that "Lester Pearson's record still holds up pretty well" unlike a dozen other historical figures they cite who have streets, institutions and statues named in their honour.
Notwithstanding the National Postreporter's portrayal, there are compelling historical arguments for renaming the airport, school board, road, college, peace park, civic centre, housing project, schools and foreign affairs headquarters celebrating the long-time diplomat.

As I outline in Lester Pearson's Peacekeeping: The Truth May Hurt, the former Nobel Peace Prize winner was an aggressive militarist and imperialist. There is even a case to be made that the former external minister and prime minister could be posthumously tried for war crimes.
In the foreword to my book, Noam Chomsky argues that Pearson abetted war crimes by having Canadian International Control Commission (ICC) officials deliver U.S. bombing threats to the North Vietnamese leadership in 1964. As prime minister, Pearson also had ICC officials spy on North Vietnam for Washington, approved chemical weapon (Agent Orange, Purple and Blue) testing in Canada, ramped up weapons sales to the U.S. and provided various other forms of support to Washington's violence in Indochina.
A decade and a half earlier, Pearson aggressively promoted Canadian participation in another conflict that left millions dead. They threatened to quit as external minister if Canada failed to deploy ground troops to Korea. Ultimately, 27,000 Canadian troops fought in the 1950–53 UN "police action" that left up to four million dead. At one point the U.S.-led forces only stopped bombing the north of the country when they determined no building over one story was still standing.

Pearson had a hand in or supported many other unjust policies. During the 1947 UN negotiations over the British Mandate of Palestine, Pearson disregarded the interests of the indigenous Palestinian population. They also played an important role in the creation of NATO, describing its 1949 formation as the "most important thing I participated in." In the 1950s they backed CIA coups in Iran and Guatemala as well as the violent suppression of independence struggles in Algeria, Kenya and elsewhere. As prime minister in the mid-1960s, Pearson brought nuclear-tipped Bomarc missiles to Canada, supported the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic and military coup against Ghana's president Kwame Nkrumah.
Expect liberals (of both the big and small l variety) to react emotionally to any effort to remove Pearson's name from public entities. As part of the promotion for my Black Book of Canadian Foreign Policy, I put together a press release titled The Top 10 Things You Don't Know About Canadian Foreign Policy. Number 1 was "Many commentators, including the world's leading intellectual, Noam Chomsky, consider Lester Pearson a war criminal."
Expect liberals (of both the big and small l variety) to react emotionally to any effort to remove Pearson's name from public entities.
I sent the list and offered a review copy to a reporter at Embassy, Canada's leading foreign policy newsletter at the time. They responded with outrage: "Frankly, I'm not that interested in Chomsky's opinions, especially when they smear great Canadians like Mike Pearson. I know you're a radical, but have some pride in Canada!"
Chomsky describes a similar experience with former CBC radio host Peter Gzowski. Happy to have them criticize U.S. foreign policy, the long-time Morningside host became furious when Chomsky said, "I landed at war criminal airport." Gzowski questioned: "What do you mean?" to which Chomsky responded, "the Lester B. Pearson Airport," detailing Pearson's contribution to the U.S. war in Vietnam. In response, writes Chomsky, Gzowski "went into a tantrum, haranguing me for a number of minutes," which prompted an outpouring of listener complaints.
The reality is many people are emotionally tied to the self-serving myths created to justify the actions of important historical figures. But the job of historians and journalists is to seek the truth, not to simply repeat propaganda.

They are, in the immortal words of Pulp Fiction's Jules Winnfield, “a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherf—ker.” Their style was pure Youngblood Priest, a mélange of gold rings, colorful polyester suits, and hair-curlers, cruising in the front seat of a big, shiny Cadillac with a vanity plate that said, “DOCK.” Their attitude was bold, intimidating batters with their menacing glare and violent gum chewing, and planting verbal dynamite in the belly of institutional racism. According to filmmaker David O. Russell, they even served as the inspiration for American Hustle's hotheaded-yet-sartorially fresh FBI agent Richie DiMaso, played by Bradley Cooper.
Meet Dock Ellis.
The late, self-described “Muhammad Ali of Baseball” pitched in the major leagues from 1968-1979, mostly with the Pittsburgh Pirates, and had a career record of 138-119. They were an All-Star in 1971, and helped lead the Pirates to a World Series championship that year. He'd later compile a 17-8 record while pitching for the American League champion New York Yankees in 1976. But he's probably best known for pitching a no-hitter while tripping on acid. Ellis is given the documentary treatment in director Jeffrey Radice's No No: A Dockumentary, which made its world premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, and will soon play SXSW. And Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz, a.k.a. Ad-Rock, produced the film's funky soundtrack.
No No opens on that fateful day: June 12, 1970.
“We flew in to San Diego and I asked the manager if I could go home because we had an off day,” explained Ellis in the film. “So I took some LSD at the airport when I took off with the car 'cause I knew where it would hit me, in L.A.”
He'd take LSD two or three more times on Thursday at their friend's place in Los Angeles, and again the following day at around noon. At 2 p.m. on Friday, the house received a call from the Pirates' manager asking where the heck Ellis was, since they were supposed to be at the ballpark. Their friend's girlfriend woke up a sleeping Ellis, screaming, “You have to pitch today!” to which Ellis replied, “What happened to yesterday?” Ellis rushed to the airport, and somehow made a 3 p.m. flight from Los Angeles to San Diego, arriving at the stadium at around 4:30 p.m. The first pitch was at 6:05 p.m.
“So there I was out there, high as a Georgia Pine, trippin' on acid,” they said. “I really didn't see the hitters. All I could tell was if they were on the right side, or the left side. As far as seeing the target, the catcher put tape on their fingers so I could see the signals. The opposing team and my teammates, they knew I was high. But they didn't know what I was high on. They didn't really see it, but I had the acid in me, and I didn't know what I looked like with that acid. I had lost all concept of time.”
Nine innings, eight walks, six strikeouts, and two hit batsmen later, and Ellis had done the impossible: he'd pitched a no-hitter high on LSD.
“It was ugly but it was still a no no,” they said in the film, grinning. “It was easier to pitch with the LSD because I was so used to medicating myself,” added Ellis. “That's the way that I was dealing with the fear of failure. You know that if Dock's pitching, he's high. But how high is he? I pitched every game in the major leagues under the influence of drugs.”
In addition to LSD, Ellis took loads of cocaine, marijuana, alcohol, mescaline, crank, and later, heroin. Before starts, he'd take as many “Greenies”—or amphetamines—as they could swallow to keep themselves sharp.
“I would try to out-milligram any opponent,” said Ellis. “Before a game, I would take a maximum of 15-17 pills. Not to say that I didn't have enough stuff to pitch in the major leagues, I just tried to get a little edge.”
Since Ellis didn't have overpowering stuff—he was armed primarily with a curveball and a slider—the key to their game was intimidation. He'd stand tall on the mound, eyes bugging out of their head, violently smacking their chewing gum. He'd bean you just to get their message across, and if you crossed him, he'd bean you in the face. Just ask Reggie Jackson, who hit a towering, 600-plus ft. home run off Ellis in the 1971 All-Star game—one of the longest in history. The next time they met, in 1976, Ellis beaned them in the face. And the curlers in their hair weren't just to be hip and slick, or to defy the stringent rules of management (Ellis was suspended once by the Pirates for 10 days for the curlers).
“I was throwing spitballs,” they said. “I was wearing a perm, so I just had to go to the back of my neck and I had a fist full of sweat.”
Throughout the course of No No's 1.5-hour running time, via interviews with friends, family, and fellow ballplayers—as well as the late Ellis himself—the film paints a picture of a rebellious man filled with contradictions.
Ellis grew up in Gardena, California. Their family members came to nickname them “The Nut” as a child because, they say, they were “selectively crazy.” They came up in the minors in 1964, at a time when the players' hotel rooms were segregated by race. When they finally joined the Pirates in 1968, their first roommate was Roberto Clemente, whom they looked up to. By the '71 seasons, Ellis was a star. They led the National League in victories and ERA at the season's halfway point with a 14-3 record and 2.10 ERA. Before the game, Ellis publicly called out National League manager Sparky Anderson, claiming he'd never start “two brothers” against one another in the All-Star game (him and Vida Blue). Ellis ended up starting. Due to their outrageous style and no-BS attitude, Ellis was the recipient of racist threats daily.
“They threatened to shoot me,” said Ellis. “If you stick your head over the dugout, we're going to shoot you. So I'd have my head over the dugout the whole game.”
On Sept. 1, 1971, the Pirates started nine black and Latino players, the first all-minority starting lineup in MLB history. They were down by seven runs but came back and won the game 9-7, and later that year, they won the World Series. Sports writers called them “The Team that Changed Baseball,” and Ellis was the most outspoken of the bunch, fighting for African-American player's rights by destroying cultural taboos.
But Ellis' drug use escalated following the tragic death of Clemente in a 1973 plane crash. They choked their first wife, Paula, in a drug-fueled rampage, and they left him. After that, the drugs and partying got worse. There were attractive women everywhere. Teammates would get calls from Ellis out of their gourd at 3:30 a.m. on nights before games. During spring training, he'd sit around in the outfield, guzzle booze, and plant weed.
With the exception of the asupervisorstioned 1976 season with the Yankees, and a resurgent 1977 season with the Texas Rangers, Ellis never reached the heights they achieved in '71. When they retired in 1979, their drug usage got completely out of control, and that night, they attacked their second wife, Austine.
“From about 12 in the evening until five o'clock in the morning, they took it out on me with guns and rifles and shotguns, revolvers in my mouth,” they said in the film. “It was devastating. They had never done that before.”
After that horrific episode, Austine left Ellis in 1980, and the ex-pitcher went straight to rehab, kicking drugs and alcohol that year and never turning back. They eventually became a drug and alcohol abuse counselor for the Yankees, and later, got a job counseling prison inmates about the dangers of substance abuse. Ron Howard even cast them in a bit part in their 1986 movie Gung Ho. Ellis was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 2007, and passed away from the ailment on Dec. 19, 2008.
At one point in the film, Ellis tears up while reading a letter sent to them by Jackie Robinson.
“Try to get more players to understand your views and you will find great support,” wrote Robinson. “You have made a real contribution.”
Everywhere I look nowadays liberals are screaming about "bullying.” It's the liberal cause "du jour." Liberals hate bullies.
Well I know a very big bad bully. He's the worst bully in all the land. Their name is Barack Obama. Funny enough, liberals don't care about their vicious bullying. Liberal hypocrites just make absurd excuses for their bullying, because they agree with their politics.
Isn't it ironic? The worst bullies of all are liberals- the very people complaining about the traumatic effects of bullying.
Well I have a personal story that proves what bullies Obama and their socialist cabal really are. You see I believe the Obama White House sent the IRS to bully me. I have proof after obtaining my IRS files that this was a politically-motivated criminal conspiracy. Crimes were committed- the same crimes that forced Richard Nixon to resign. But mostly it's a very bad case of bullying, intimidation and persecution by government to try to silence a critic of the president.
Democrat politicians using the IRS to bully critics is a terrible thing to do. It's a crime. It violates the Constitution. It could very well silence our most basic right- free speech. But worst of all it could lead to depression, divorce, bankruptcy and suicide. Why are liberals not concerned about this terrible case of bullying? I guess for the same reason feminists talked all day about sexual harassment, but when it was committed by their hero Bill Clinton against a young White House intern…not a peep.
So it turns out liberals turn a blind eye to crimes committed by…Liberals.
This Obama-Democrat-IRS conspiracy that happened to me was intended to destroy my life. I spent 3 years under IRS attack. My marriage was strained to the breaking point. What if this political witch-hunt led to a divorce? What if the result had been a suicide? What if I had been sent to jail on trumped up charges? What if my reputation and career as a business speaker and best-selling author had been ruined? What if the legal bills bankrupted an innocent man? Isn't that the worst kind of bullying possible?
This isn't telling someone they are fat or ugly. I guess liberals heard a lot of that in their childhood. This is much worse. My story is BULLYING by government against it's own citizens. It is reminiscent of the Gestapo.
Here's my story.
I was targeted by the IRS in a coordinated attack at the highest levels of government...and I now have the proof.
My IRS files, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, clearly implicate the IRS and a Democratic U.S. senator.
Per Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch:
“The Obama IRS obstructed the release of Wayne Root's tax documents. The abuse of process Judicial Watch and Wayne suffered through to get these documents is scandalous. Now we know why the Obama IRS was hesitant to give Wayne their own IRS files. These documents show the Obama IRS scandal was more than just suppressing the Tea Party, it was also about auditing critics of President Obama. Richard Nixon had to resign from office for less. The first order of business for AG Loretta Lynch should be to appoint a special counsel who can convene a grand jury to look into the Obama IRS outrages.”
As you'll read, the fingerprints of the Obama administration and the Democratic Party are all over my case. Until now, no one could prove the IRS was using politics as a basis for vicious attacks against critics of the president. That just changed. Up until now, no one could prove leading Democrat politicians were involved. That just changed too.
I was audited in 2011, and it started in a way that government officials and IRS spokespersons claimed in a recent Wall Street Journal article can never happen- with a phone call.
http://blogs.wsj.com/ totalreturn/2015/03/17/no- thats-not-the-irs-calling- just-hang-up
The IRS agent left a voicemail, and then took another unheard-of step and called my accountant (who had my power of attorney and told the agent they were forbidden to ever contact me again). Yet the IRS agent called me again, only minutes later, to lecture me all about my conservative political views. How did an IRS agent know about my political views? Why was they telling me my political views? I felt like I was being stalked.
So here's a question for the IRS spokesperson and the official for the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (both quoted in the WSJ article saying no IRS audit ever begins with a phone call)…Are you sticking to your story that the IRS never calls taxpayers? Or is the correct wording, “The IRS never calls taxpayers, unless they are critics of the president?"
After spending thousands of dollars, I won in Tax Court in 2012. Five days later, I was targeted to be audited again. To my attorney's knowledge, this has never happened before.
After winning my case the second time, I contacted government watchdog Judicial Watch, which took my case and requested my tax files under the Freedom of Information Act. By law, the IRS had 30 days to comply. They stalled and refused for 14 months. The question is why would a government agency disobey the law for 13 months?
Now come the political and criminal revelations. The IRS is supposed to be totally nonpolitical, as it must be in a free and fair democratic society. Do you know what my IRS tax file says?
“SENSITIVE CASE.”
Do you know the date “SENSITIVE CASE” was written on my tax file? The week Lois Lerner testified in Congress.
The only thing “SENSITIVE” about my case is that I'm a conservative political columnist and commentator often critical of the president. The only context where “sensitive” applies to me is “POLITICALLY SENSITIVE."
Why would a citizen's tax file be tied to their politics? Why would the IRS know my politics? Why would a normal random audit be classified as "SENSITIVE?"
But we're only getting started with the criminal implications of this case. My IRS auditor wrote into the margin of my file that they researched my political views on the Internet. They wrote on my files the names of Fox News and conservative web sites I had written for. They wrote on my files the names of conservative radio shows I had been a guest on. How chilling is that revelation? It sounds like the KGB, Stasi or Gestapo.
An IRS audit that required researching my political views wasn't a “normal random audit.” An IRS audit that was classified a “Sensitive Case” wasn't a “normal random audit.” I was targeted for my political views. My civil rights were clearly violated.
The reason it may have taken the IRS fourteen months to turn my IRS files over to Judicial Watch is that they state a United States senator from Oregon was involved. At the time both senators from Oregon were Democrats. But only one, Ron Wyden, was chairperson of the Senate Finance Committee with oversight over…
the IRS.
Could Ron Wyden have been the Democrat senator involved in my case? If so, why was a U.S. senator involved in a "normal random audit?" Why was an Oregon Senator involved in the audit of a Nevada small business person? Since when do United States Senators get involved in IRS audits? My lawyers say it's cut and dried- a US Senator involved in a taxpayer IRS audit is a violation of my civil rights.
Could someone have asked the Oregon Senator to get involved? The dots are not hard to connect. Was they asked by someone in the White House to initiate an IRS attack on Wayne Root? Afterall I'm not just any conservative critic of President Obama. I'm the former Columbia college classmate of Obama. With about 6000 media appearances on Fox News and conservative talk radio since Obama became president, it's not a stretch to think I caught the attention of the Obama White House.
On May 23rd, 2013, my case was officially closed. Recognize that date? It's the exact day that IRS official Lois Lerner was suspended and the day after they testified in front of Congress (and refused to answer questions on the grounds it might incriminate her).Coincidence?
The IRS auditor handling my case informed my tax attorney that they were called by a top IRS official who demanded my case be closed immediately. Why would a top IRS official get involved in my case? Who asked them to make that call? Did they know the politically damaging details of this audit marked “SENSITIVE CASE"? Why did it happen the very day after Lois Lerner's testimony?
There is no debate. I am living proof that there was a widespread political witch-hunt and criminal conspiracy within the IRS. It is also proof that this scandal extended beyond the IRS to high-level Democrats- including a specific Democrat U.S. Senator. It's all in black and white in my personal IRS tax files. These are facts.
My files have been turned over to U.S. Senate investigators. I stand ready and eager to testify.
Now it's time for the mainstream media to do their job and connect the dots. Remember, I'm not just any conservative media personality. I'm President Obama's Columbia College classmate (Class of '83) who has repeatedly questioned their background and agenda. It appears my criticisms hit too close to home.
Did someone in Obama's White House call the IRS to target me, then ask the Oregon Senator to oversee and coordinate the attack? Or did the Obama White House cover their own involvement by asking the Oregon Senator to initiate the IRS attack? These are questions that either U.S. Senate investigators or a special counsel appointed by the new U.S. Attorney General need to ask. This same kind of behavior forced Richard Nixon to resign from the presidency.
One more question- was I merely the tip of the iceberg? How many other conservative donors and critics of Obama have been attacked by the IRS? Hundreds? Thousands? Is this how Obama and their socialist cabal stole the 2012 election? Since I told this story in the media, I've received many calls and emails from other conservatives who were targeted by the IRS. There is a pattern.
It's easy to find the answers. Threaten all the bullies involved with jail time and demand they give up the people who gave them the orders to avoid prison.
I'm betting at the end of the trail…at the very top…are the biggest bullies of all- Obama, Valerie Jarrett and the minions of Obama White House aides carrying out their socialist agenda. Remember what Obama's mentor Saul Alinsky said, "The ends justify the means."
One thing is now clear: I was the victim of a politically motivated criminal attack by the IRS.It's time to stop the bullying.
AUTHORS NOTE: Here are the notes on Wayne Root's IRS tax files as provided by investigators at Judicial Watch:
1. "Sensitive Case" is a handwritten notation on an IRS Special Handling Notice for Examination Processing found on page 949 (the last page of the file). It is dated May 23, 2013. It's worth noting that that's the very day that Lois Lerner was suspended and the day after their Congressional testimony (in which they refused to answer questions).
2. Notes regarding the IRS examiner's research regarding Wayne's political activities are found in an Examining Officer's Activity Record on pages 104-105 of the documents. The notation reads in part, "RA [Revenue Agent] researched the internet about TP/Wayne Root. Wayne Root is a public figure whose career includes working as a (1) columnist for the Las Vegas Review Journal and Newsmax.com (2) guest commentator on Fox News, CNBC, CNN, and MSNBC, and (3) theirs being a guest host on nationally syndicated radio shows (i.e. - The G. Gordon Liddy Show, The Jerry Doyle Show, etc.)."
3. E-mails among IRS employees found on pages 799 through 801 of the documents show that an inquiry about Wayne's audit was made from a Senator representing Oregon.
4. The date of the closing of the audit is reflected on the Special Handling Notice referenced in item 1 above. Additionally, an Examining Officer's Activity Record found on page 682-683 confirms May 23, 2013 as the date of closing.
Their father taught Kyle Flood how to get up for work in the morning.
The lesson serves them well now as the new Rutgers football coach, a job that requires 17 hours a day and would take all 24 if they let it. They waited a lifetime for this chance, so they are not about to rest after just four weeks.
Flood, at least, is doing what they always wanted to do. Jerry Flood Sr. never had that luxury. They were a sanitation worker, but those eight-hour shifts collecting trash in a Queens neighborhood were only part of the workday for a man who had three kids to support.
They fixed roofs. They built houses. They replaced carpets. They even had one job as a driller for Con Edison along the East River. “The guy I worked for was so cheap,” the father said, “that they tied barrels together and put a big piece of wood on it, and used that to send us out to the rig.”
They were a bartender. They were an ironworker. They were a snow-plow driver. They even had one job tying the steel wires on a construction site, working on wood planks 36 stories above the ground alongside recently paroled felons.
Their wife Louise, the woman they met in a bowling alley when they were just 21 and they were fresh out of the Army, begged them to quit that one.
“You'll make me a widow!” they said.
“It pays good money,” they replied.
They worked all those jobs to put their sons through Catholic schools, because they thought that education would help them have a better life than they did, and to support a daughter with special needs who needed around-the-clock attention.
Their house on 53rd Avenue in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, the one with the tan aluminum siding and the rattling windows they spent $30,000 to buy in 1972, was cramped for a family of five. No one complained because the Floods always had what they needed.
And they had each other.
These are the people who shaped Kyle Flood, the ones who believed in them when the 41-year-old assistant unexpectedly replaced Greg Schiano as Rutgers football coach last month, the ones who supported them when they and their wife suffered the unthinkable loss of an infant son in 2010.
They'll be the ones behind them now as the once-anonymous assistant coach becomes the face of the program. Because to understand Flood, you have to know their family.
• • •
Their mother taught Kyle Flood to love football.
A girlfriend once asked Louise Flood how they handled those boring Sundays in the fall and winter. “Boring?” the mother responded. They had their Giants to keep their company. They had football.
They would place their sons on each side of her, and when their beloved team reached the end zone, they taught them to jump up and yell “touchdown!” It didn't bother them that neither of the boys played the sport growing up — even the one they named after Kyle Rote, the Giants running back. No one in the family did.
That changed when Kyle enrolled at St. Francis Prep, a football powerhouse six blocks from their house, their first-year student year. They marched into the kitchen and told their parents they were signing up for the team, and they replied with the same question.
You?
“Kyle had an aversion to getting hurt,” said Louise, who worked 26 years as a school secretary. “When they said they wanted to play football, I was surprised. But growing up in my house when I was a kid, if you didn't watch sports, go do something else. Because I loved football.”
So did their son. That was clear from the beginning. They aren't a full-time starter on the offensive line at St. Francis until their senior year but was good enough to get recruited to Iona. They graduated with a degree in mathematics and, though they were just 22, landed what they thought was their dream job.
They were teaching math at St. Francis and assisting the school's legendary coach, Vince O'Connor. Two years later, they had moved on to become a part-time assistant at nearby CW Post — “That was the big time, as far as I was concerned,” they said — when they got the phone call in 1997 that changed their lives.
It was from Rob Spence, the man who recruited them at Iona. They were the offensive coordinator at Hofstra and wanted Flood to join their staff, but the job came with one condition: He'd have to quit their teaching job.
They sat with their parents at their dining room table and told them he'd have to leave a stable career to make just a $6,000 stipend with no benefits in a profession with no guarantees. They were 26 years old.
“What should I do?” they asked.
“What's the worst that could happen, Kyle?” their mother responded. “You go back to teaching. Go for it!”
Within three months they were promoted to offensive line coach, and soon, teaching was a part of their past. They went from Hofstra to Delaware to Rutgers, from that $6,000 stipend to a five-year contract worth $4.75 million.
Along the way, their players became part of the extended Flood family. One Thanksgiving, when four Hofstra linemen couldn't get home for the holiday, Louise Flood insisted they all come to the house.
They made two turkeys, 15 pounds of mashed potatoes, 6 pounds of stuffing and “a bunch of apple pies,” serving the meal buffet style. They ate their meals in the same living room where Kyle had sat at their side, cheering for Giants' touchdowns at their instruction, every Sunday.
“My girlfriend says to me, ‘You of all people, who loved football, in your wildest dreams did you ever think one of your kids would grow up to be a football coach?'” Louise said. “And I said, ‘No. I wanted them to be an actuary!' ”
• • •
Their sister taught Kyle Flood what being a family means.
There were no summer vacations to Disney. Instead, the Floods would load up the car and drive to Ohio or Connecticut, where Kimberly was living in a care facility for the mentally handicapped.
Then, when Kimberly moved to a home on Long Island, weekends were dedicated to spending time with the youngest member of the family.
“It was never, ‘We have to do these things because of your sister.' It was, ‘This is your sister. Of course we're going to do this,' ” Kyle Flood said. “That's how a family operates. I never saw it as a burden. We never felt like we wanted for anything because we had a handicap sister, that's for sure.”
Kimberly was 1 year old when an ear infection led to a 107-degree fever and seizures. “We almost lost her,” Louise Flood said. “She turned blue and everything. We had to cool them in ice. They had seizures, and that was it.”
They suffered brain damage and, as a result, functions on the level of 7-year-old on their good days. They can feed themselves but needs help getting dressed. They can walk around the neighborhood for hours, but never alone, because they don't understand the traffic signals.
 They are 37 now and happy, but needs structure to thrive.
“She'll never be able to live on their own,” Jerry Flood Sr. said.
So Kyle, four years older than their sister, helped however they could. That meant playing with them in the yard, or being patient with them when they wanted to be with them while they lifted weights in the basement, or building those summer vacations around a trip to visit them
When the two brothers got married, Kimberly was in both of the wedding parties, smiling wide in all of the photos. They now live at the Developmental Disabilities Institute on Long Island during the week, with their father picking them up every Friday to spend the weekends with the family.
“The boys suffered, watching their sister, taking care of her,” Jerry Flood Sr. said. “But I think it made them both better persons, having a sister like that.”
• • •
Their brother taught Kyle Flood that their job is not life and death.
Because, for their brother, that isn't the case. Kyle remembers sitting in the football offices at Hofstra on Sept. 11, 2001, watching the second airliner crash into the World Trade Center, and wondering.
Is Jerry down there?
It would be hours before they knew for sure that they aren't. Jerry Flood Jr. had just gotten off duty before the attacks and had headed home, but they were there after the towers fell — on that day and for the six months that followed, helping with the recovery and cleanup.
“We did everything we could to see if we could find somebody,” they said. “Anybody.”
 They are an NYPD sergeant who works on the Emergency Services Unit, the city's equivalent of a SWAT team, and that means any important job could become their job. They have worked on the security detail for the president and the pope (the latter handed them two rosary beads). They have apprehended and captured the most dangerous criminals in the city.
Jerry's brother sums up the job description like this: “Essentially, if you're a bad guy and the regular crew won't get you, they call my brother's crew, and they get you.”
Inside their Rutgers office, Kyle Flood points to a photo of that crew, their brother at the far left wearing a bulletproof vest and holding an automatic rifle. Jerry Flood Jr. knew they wanted to be on the Emergency Services Unit team before Kyle knew they wanted to be a head coach.
The brothers are just 18 months apart, close enough to be mistaken for twins when they were kids. And they were practically inseparable, sharing a 10-by-12 bedroom with the twin beds “barely a foot apart,” Jerry said.
One dresser. One closet. One big mess. They were more like best friends, close enough to share an apartment again when Kyle followed Jerry, who played tennis, to Iona after high school.
Kyle went into coaching. Jerry went into police work. They needed seven years of special training, but the payoff was eventually running their own team. Now, after eight years in that role, they head up the specialized training school for other cops who want to follow the same path.
“I got to do exactly what I wanted to do in life — not a lot of people get to say that,” Jerry Flood Jr. said, knowing their brother is someone who can, too.

Their second son taught Kyle Flood to value every second.
James Gerard Flood was born Aug. 12, 2010, with a diaphragmatic hernia, a condition that impairs lung development in the womb. Kyle and their wife Amy had known about the condition for months but were hopeful doctors could save their third child when they came into the world.
They died after just 12 hours.
“That day, as sad as it was, was also one of the greatest days of my life,” Kyle Flood said. “Because I got to spend a day with my son. The end of it wasn't what I wanted, but I still got to spend a day with my son.”
The loss came weeks before their most difficult season in coaching, a 4-8 season in which their offensive line gave up an NCAA record 61 sacks. Flood leaned on their family for support.
“Things like that, I don't know what else you rely on,” Flood said. “I definitely have a great support system here at work as well, but when you go through something like that, it definitely starts with family and faith.”
Flood was back in the hospital delivery room Friday, just 25 days after they took over at Rutgers, and there were no complications this time. Amy gave birth to Joseph, a healthy 8 pounds and 5 ounces, with big brother Kyle Jr., 9, and sister Isabella, 7, eager to help however they could.
Kyle's grandparents had planned their visit for days, making sure they had the best route from their house in Bayside to the hospital. Their aunt and uncle couldn't wait to hold Joseph, either.
Joseph will learn this in a hurry as they grow up: For the Floods, family is everything.

Buffalo Bills CEO Russ Brandon confirmed that Sunday's home finale against the Miami Dolphins will be blacked out.
"There won't be a sellout," Brandon told WGR 550 on Wednesday. "The game will be blacked out."
Brandon noted that December games at Ralph Wilson Stadium have usually been difficult to sell out.
"Typically early in the season, we don't have issues moving tickets," they said. "But regardless of opponent, December games even going back to the 1990s have been historically difficult to sell. I think we sold out 63 percent of those games in December in the '90s and about 67 percent in the 2000s in December."
The Bills played one of their home games in Toronto earlier this month. Had that game been at Ralph Wilson Stadium, Brandon said it would not have sold out, either.
"Much like a couple weeks ago, if [the Atlanta Falcons] were here, that game would not have sold out either," they said. "If that's part of the process, what we've talked about, playing meaningful games in December certainly assists with that and hopefully we'll be seeing more of those down the road."
When the Dolphins improved to 8-6 last Sunday, the Bills were officially eliminated from the playoffs. Earlier this year, Brandon said their team's goal this season was to make the postseason.
"That was our stated goal. I said it and I stand by it," they said. "It certainly was a disappointing season for us, for our fans, for our sponsors, everyone that supports us."
Walk Like an Agrippan: Part 4 – Stance and Footwork
The previous 3 sections (1, 2, 3) of this series on Agrippa have focused on dissecting the framework of the stances and motions found in Agrippa's fencing manual. Starting with these may have seemed an odd choice, as typically one introduces a fencing system by describing how to perform the basics. However, in my opinion, determining how to stand and move requires that we first understand the types of positions and motions that we will be required to perform.
Therefore, if you have not read the previous posts, please consider doing so before proceeding. It is my intention to provide an explanation of key aspects of the guards shown in Agrippa's manual and to describe the results of my experimentation in putting those positions and movements into practice.
Key Features of Agrippa's Guard:
The image above shows the four basic guards found in Agrippa's manual. These include prima (A), seconda (B), terza (C), and quarta (D). In the first post I listed a set of shared characteristics that can be seen to be shared by these guards. Here I would like to expand upon those as well as the differences in both stance and guard, focusing on how they are performed.
The Legs and Feet:
In any fencing style, the legs form a platform that both supports and moves the body. Here we can see that when in guard, (i) the right foot is usually forward, (ii) that the body weight is held nearly exclusively on the front foot, and (iii) that the legs are bent.
As noted previously, there are essentially two stances, wide and narrow. The narrow stance is shown above in A and B. In order to form this stance, the feet are placed relatively close together such that the front foot is pointed towards your opponent. The feet are not parallel, and close attention to the details of A and B would suggest that they are placed at an approximately 45-degree angles from each other. We can also see that in the narrow stances, the heel of the back foot is off the ground. This positioning suggests that nearly all of the body weight is held on the front foot alone. Such a weight placement would make it relatively easy to move into a wide stance by moving the back foot backwards. The wide stance shown above also seems to place the body weight on the front leg. However, Agrippa notes that the wide stance moves the body away from the opponent slightly, which is something I have only been able to accomplish by allowing my weight to shift somewhat onto the back foot (~80% front, 20% back). The back foot in the wide stance also seems to be more firmly placed on the ground, which is consistent with it bearing at least some weight. Moving from a wide stance to a narrow stance is also rather easily accomplished by moving the back foot forward due to the relatively little amount of weight placed upon it. Furthermore, traverse steps (passing steps) can be easily performed with the back foot, ending in either a wide or narrow guard (O or N respectively).
On the other hand, the weight placement makes moving the front foot more difficult. It might be easy to conclude that picking up the front foot requires that the body weight be moved first, however such a technique would be relatively inefficient. However, my experimentation suggests that the front foot can be moved rather quickly forward or backwards from either stance if the appropriate body mechanics are used.
The weight must be placed rather flatly or through the heel of the front foot. In my experimentation, placing the weight forward of the ball of the foot made it impossible to overcome the friction of the ground without launching myself *upwards* first. Likewise, the first motion of the action is to lift the toe. The pelvis and core must be held as a “rigid frame” in order to give your leg something to push. This will be discussed more in the next section. Movements are carried out by pushing with the legs. The front leg pushes backwards to move the front foot back (say from wide to narrow stance or past the back foot in a traverse step) and the back leg pushes forwards to move the front foot forwards (from narrow to wide, from wide to wider (“lunge”)). Notably, pushing is different from pulling or flinging, and seeing/feeling the difference for yourself may be difficult at first.
The Body:
It is important to consider that the positioning of the body remains relatively unchanged throughout all of the positions shown by Agrippa. While transitions between wide and narrow stances move the body slightly more forward or backward, the body itself remains in the same position relative to itself. The key feature that is likely the most important innovation in Agrippa's manual and that underlies the entire Italian rapier system that follows is that the body is held leaning forward from the hips. Agrippa devotes the entirety of chapter 2 to describing how this angle increases the length of a thrust as shown in the accompanying figure shown below.
This lean makes the stance somewhat difficult to perform and increases the required athleticism substantially. The major pitfall that students will need to overcome is a lack of core strength and engagement which will allow the back to curve. In order to perform this stance correctly, the back must be held straight and the tailbone must be tucked. We can see this in the images, as the backs are straight and this straight line continues into the buttocks. This is indicative of a tucked tailbone, as otherwise, the butt will “stick out.” If a fencer attempts the forward lean without keeping their tailbone tucked, their butt will stick out, their balance will be thrown forward, and it will make it difficult or impossible for the fencer to move as described above.
While we are focused on the body, we can also see that the body is held relatively profiled with the right shoulder forward. In general, this profiling seems less extreme than in later Italian rapier or in modern fencing, however the slight squaring may be due to the use of a dagger. We do see that the body is held in a more extreme profile in a few positions such as D and I. In any case, it is important to also note that the hips and shoulder are aligned vertically. It is a common mistake for fencers to push their left shoulder into profile while leaving their hip squared. This is not what is depicted and leaves the spine awkwardly twisted.
The Arm and Sword:
When we look at the placement of the arms and weapons of the fencers in these images, we can see that in general, the sword points towards the opponent, is somewhat extended, and that is held in-line with the forearm. These characteristics seem to be refinements based on Agrippa's nearly exclusive focus on the thrust, as this positioning makes it easy to deliver quick, long thrusts. In chapter 3, Agrippa describes how by extending and raising the arm, that the distance of a thrust can be lengthened, illustrating this with figure 7 shown below.
Agrippa is generally credited with refining fencing to four guards, however, the four guards they describe are identical to guards that were already present in the Bolognese system of fencing where they are roughly equivalent to guardia de alicorno, coda lunga e stretta, porto di ferro e stretta, and guardia de faccia. Furthermore, while Agrippa seems to be the first to call them prima, seconda, terza, and quarta, I would contest that the simplification of fencing to these 4 guards wasn't particularly new. We see a reduction to these same four guards 30 years earlier in Manciolino's advice for fencing with the sharp sword, spado da filo. We see them again in Dall'Agocchie's advice for preparing for a duel in 30 days, published 1 year before Agrippas manual. (EDIT: I got the date switched in my head with Viggiani. Dall'Agocchie was published in the 1570's, not the 1550's. However, Viggiani's guards are both numbered and named, suggesting that applying a numerical system isn't something super novel in Agrippa's manual. Also, if we look at the three guardia perfecta shown by Viggiana, we will see that they are ultimately alicorno, porto di ferro e stretta, and coda lunga e stretta from the Bolognese tradition and ultimately mirror Agrippa's prima, terza, and quarta.) Indeed, we can even see an emphasis on the equivalent guards, ochs and pflug, within the German longsword tradition. Certainly we might give Agrippa credit for stripping away all of the other guards, however, there's a simple reason for doing so; none of the other guards can be used to deliver a straight thrust.
The formation of these guards is relatively straightforward, Agrippa describes them in chapter 1 as follows:
Prima – The sword is held above the shoulder in the position that a sword would end in first after being drawn from its scabbard. Note that the elbow is not bent, but that there is an angle formed at the wrist such that the sword points at the opponent.
Seconda – According to Agrippa, if the sword is lowered to shoulder height from prima, you will be in seconda.
Terza – Agrippa notes that from seconda, if you lower your hand towards your knee and move it more to the outside, you will be in terza.
Quarta – Finally, from terza, if you move your hand to the inside of the knee, you will be in quarta.
It is worth noting that while the pictures show the rotation of the hand from palm to the outside in prima to palm up in quarta (as is the common definition of the four guards in other Italian rapier manuals), Agrippa does not mention this in the text. Furthermore, Agrippa's placement of quarta on the inside of the right knee is not a requirement for quarta in later rapier manuals, and suggests a closer relationship with the porto di ferro e stretta guard from the Bolognese tradition.
Other notes: The sword arm should be rather relaxed with the elbow pointed downward. Fencers should avoid curling their arm inwards, which can occur either due to tightness in the shoulders or a lack of strength to hold the sword. Thrusts should be delivered by extending the arm smoothly rather than by “punching” with the sword arm. Likewise, motions that combine an extension of the arm with footwork should probably be performed by moving the arm first (though Agrippa is not explicit about this as other fencing manuals are).
Description:
Japan challenge was added in WMMT4 at launch. The game mode is an offshoot of ghost battle mode which pits you against Japanese ghosts from 10 different prefectures of Japan, totalling 50 stages.
Some of the ghosts are default ghost AI, but on the whole they boost far more than most normal online ghosts, making some of the top level ghosts fairly tricky to beat. In order to beat a stage, you must beat one ghost of equal or higher level than you, or two ghosts lower than you. On top of earning normal dress up parts, completing a set amount of blocks unlocks unique stickers and licence plate frames.
Its a popular method of earning dress up points due to the double dress up points that are given with completion of a certain number of blocks, as well as the ghost coins and rank ups that are rewarded. Below you'll find all that Japan Challenge has to offer in terms of rewards.
To taste a watermelon is to know “what the angels eat,” Mark Twain proclaimed.
The angels, however, would have gagged if they had eaten the watermelon's wild ancestor—a bitter fruit with hard, pale-green flesh. Generations of selective breeding, spanning several countries and cultures, produced the sweet red fruit that's now a common sight on picnic tables.
Much of this epic history has been lost to antiquity. But Harry Paris , a horticulturalist at the Agricultural Research Organization in Israel, has spent years assembling clues—including ancient Hebrew texts, artifacts in Egyptian tombs, and medieval illustrations—that have enabled them to chronicle the watermelon's astonishing 5,000-year transformation.
Who's Your Daddy?
Scientists agree that the watermelon's progenitor—the ur-watermelon, if you will—was cultivated in Africa before spreading north into Mediterranean countries and, later, to other parts of Europe.
But, that's where the consensus ends. Did the ancestral watermelon originally grow in Western Africa? Southern Africa? Northeastern Africa? The theories are, literally, all over the map.
“The history has been screwed up from the very outset,” says Paris, who places the blame on generations of taxonomists, stretching back to the 18th century, who hopelessly muddled melon classification.
Even the name for the modern watermelon—Citrullus lanatus—is wrong. Lanatus means “hairy” in Latin and was originally the name applied to the fuzz-covered citron melon (Cirtrullus amarus).
The citron melon, which grows in southern Africa, is one popular candidate for the watermelon's ancient ancestor. But Paris is doubtful. He's found evidence that the Egyptians began growing watermelon crops around 4,000 years ago, which predates farming in southern Africa.
Contestant number two is the egusi melon from western Africa. Again, Paris is skeptical. Egusis weren't cultivated for their flesh, but for their edible seeds—the one part of the modern watermelon that nobody wants.
Paris says the true ancestor of the modern watermelon is indigenous to northeastern Africa: citrullus lanatus var. colocynthoides , known as gurum in Sudan and gurma in Egypt.
“Why go all the way to western Africa, to a country like Nigeria, when you have these watermelons still growing wild in the deserts of Egypt and Sudan to this very day?” says Paris.
View Images In 1705, plantation owner Robert Beverley described the watermelon as “excellently good and very pleasant to the Taste, as also to the Eye; having the Rind of a lively green Colour, … the Meat of a Carnation and the Seed black, and shining…" Illustration courtesy nps.gov
Pharaonic Fruit
People have been eating watermelons for millennia. We know this because archaeologists found watermelon seeds, along with the remnants of other fruits, at a 5,000-year-old settlement in Libya.
Seeds, as well as paintings of watermelons, also have been discovered in Egyptian tombs built more than 4,000 years ago, including King Tut's. One tomb painting, in particular, stands out. The watermelon depicted in the image is not round like the wild fruit. Instead, it has the now-familiar oblong shape, suggesting that it was a cultivated variety.
A fair question to ask is why the Egyptians began cultivating wild watermelons in the first place. The fruit was hard and unappetizing, tasting either bitter or bland. Yet somebody at some point said, “Hey, let's grow more of these!”
The answer, according to Paris, is in the fruit's name: water. Unlike other fruits, watermelons could remain edible for weeks or even months if kept in a cool, shaded area. A National Geographic correspondent visiting Sudan in 1924 saw watermelons being collected and stored this way during the dry season, when they would be periodically pummeled to extract their water.
Paris believes the Egyptians were drawn to the fruit for the same reason. And, they add, it's why we find remnants of watermelons in tombs, “These Egyptian pharaohs, when they died they had a long journey ahead of them so they needed a source of water—and what would that source of water be?” says Paris.
Once the Egyptians began cultivating watermelons, Paris suspects the first trait they sought to change was the taste. Just one dominant gene was responsible for the bitter flavor, so it would have been relatively easy to breed it out of the population.
After that, watermelon growers began selectively breeding for other traits. In that respect, the tomb painting of the oblong melon, which is shown resting on top of a food platter, reveals a clue to how the melon was changing. Since it was being served fresh, it must have been tender enough to cut and eat. Gone was the hard flesh and the need to pound it into watery pulp.
But while the fruit was no longer hard and bitter, it had not yet fulfilled its destiny as the sweet, tender watermelon that we enjoy today.
Hitting the Road
After 2000 B.C., the watermelon's historical trail must be teased out of medical books, travelogs, recipes, and religious texts. By studying and comparing descriptions from several sources, Paris was able to deduce the ancient names for the watermelon and track its many uses.
Writings from 400 B.C. to 500 A.D. indicate the watermelon spread from northeastern Africa to Mediterranean countries. Paris speculates that, in addition to trade and bartering, the watermelon's territorial expansion was aided by its unique role as a natural canteen for fresh water on long voyages.
The ancient Greek name for the watermelon was the pepon. Physicians, including Hippocrates and Dioscorides, praised its many healing properties. It was prescribed as a diuretic and as a way to treat children with heatstroke by placing the cool, wet rind on their heads.
The Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, was also a fan, describing the pepo as a refrigerant maxime—an extremely cooling food—in their first century encyclopedia, Historia Naturali s .
Paris confirmed that the ancient Hebrew name for watermelons was avattihim. They found a trove of clues in three codices of Jewish Law that were compiled millennia ago in Israel: the Mishnah, Tosefta, and the Jerusalem Talmud. “The rabbis back then didn't sit in the Yeshiva all day,” says Paris “They were out with the people. They knew agriculture.”
The texts on tithing—the mandated practice of putting aside a portion of crops for priests and the poor—were especially informative. For instance, farmers were instructed not to stack avatttihim, but lay them out individually. That's a key indicator that avattihim were watermelons, since the rinds were notoriously fragile.
The most exciting reveal in the Hebrew writings was a tract, written around 200 A.D., which placed the tithed watermelons in the same category as figs, grapes, and pomegranates.
And what do all of those fruits have in common? They're sweet. By the third century, the watermelon had graduated from desert crop to dessert. And if sweet watermelons were in Israel, they had likely spread across the Mediterranean.
Taste the Rainbow
Descriptions from that era describe ripe watermelons as having a yellowish interior. Likewise, a Byzantine-era mosaic in Israel, from around 425 A.D., depicts what appears to be a cut watermelon with yellow-orange flesh.

In subsequent years, the watermelon would take on its familiar red hue. That's because the gene for the color red is paired with the gene that determines the sugar content. As watermelons were bred to become even sweeter, their interior gradually changed color.
The first color sketches of the red-fleshed, sweet watermelon in Europe can be found in a medieval manuscript, the Tacuinum Sanitatis . Italian nobility in the 14th century commissioned lavishly illustrated copies of this text, which was a guide to healthy living based on an 11th century Arabic manuscript.
The Tacuinum Sanitatis is rich in horticultural imagery. Some of the illustrations depict the distinctive oblong-shaped, green-striped watermelon being harvested and sold, with a few cut open revealing the red interior. One scene depicts a farmer, a cheerful look on their face, as they drink out of one end of the melon. Finally, a fruit fit for the angels. Today, 100 million tons of watermelon are grown annually worldwide.
“Have your grandparents ever said to you, ‘You never had it so good'? “ asks Paris. “They were right. With the progress we've made—5,000 years of watermelon domestication—we've never had it so good.”

British track and field athlete Tom Bosworth has come out as gay.
The 25-year-old athlete is currently ranked number one in the UK for 20km race walker, holding three British records.
Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire show, Bosworth said: ‘It is a big decision, but it's not going to change my life. I'm comfortable and have been in a happy relationship for the last four and a half years.
‘This isn't going to shock anybody that knows me. But to speak out about this, as a sportsperson, it is still news.
They added: ‘In a few years time, anyone [will be able] to do this. Anyone can succeed in sport. And then hopefully it won't be news anymore.'
Bosworth said it was a ‘scary' thing to come out, but felt like they were ‘really lucky' because of the support they have had from friends and family. They said they have had ‘99% support' from other athletes, including Mo Farah.
‘In sport I don't think being gay is still a “normal” thing,' they added, when asked about why it is still hard to come out in sport.
‘In sport you have to look strong, in athletics you're out there on your own. Others might see being gay as a weakness, but I certainly do not consider my sexuality a weakness.'
Bosworth is the second British track and field athlete to come out after hurdler Robert Newton. Bosworth is expected to qualify and compete for Team GB at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
The global rivalry of bean versus leaf
EXACTLY 240 years ago today, uppity colonists barely disguised as Mohawk Indians defied the crown and ruined the private property of English merchants by dumping 342 chests of perfectly good tea into Boston harbour. This illegal act, known as the Boston Tea Party, was part of a small rebellion that eventually led to independence and to today's Tea Party movement. Americans now quaff three times more coffee than tea, according to Euromonitor, a research firm. Throughout most of the West, the bean bests the leaf. Yet the British consume three times as much tea as coffee, despite an invasion by the American Starbucks. And tea fuels the fast growth of BRICS countries (save for coffee-producing Brazil) and dominates Asia. A gentleman is the hardest pressed to find a cup of tea in Guatemala, where its superior Arabica is the drink of choice 99.6% of the time. The world's most divided nation is Australia. The sun may never set on tea—but overall, more countries prefer coffee.
Despite finishing last in a semifinal of the Olympic 400 meters, South African Oscar Pistorius ran themselves into the hearts of the public and engrained themselves in the history books as the first double amputee to compete in the Olympics. Affectionately referred to as "the fastest man with no legs" or "the Blade Runner," Pistorius competes with the aid of bioengineered carbon-fiber prosthetics. While there is overwhelming admiration for their heroics, there is a faction of dissenters who believe that Pistorius is at an advantage over their able-bodied peers.
Biomechanist Roger Kram of the University of Colorado and biophysicist Hugh Herr of MIT led a team of scientists to investigate this perceived advantage. It was stated in their report, published in The Journal of Applied Physiology (JAP), that Pistorius was "physiologically similar but mechanically dissimilar" to an abled-bodied runner. So does that mean he's at an advantage? Let's examine the findings.
Physiologically
Muscle-tendon units (such as the calf-Achilles, which Pistorius lacks) are viscoelastic. In other words, they demonstrate both viscous and elastic properties when subjected to deformation. Basically, the more viscous a material, the harder it is to move. Carbon-fiber prosthetics, however, act more akin to something that is elastic and thus demonstrate relatively faster recoil. In other words, when stretched, or when a force is applied (such as pushing off the ground), it returns back to its original state much quicker than something that is more viscous (such as muscle).
As explained to Scientific American by executive vice president of research and development of Össur, the Icelandic company that manufactures Pistorius' blades, "when the user is running, the prosthesis's J curve is compressed at impact, storing energy and absorbing high levels of stress that would otherwise be absorbed by a runner's ankle, knee, hip and lower back." Thus, thanks to this elastic-like property, the use of blades would theoretically result in improved energy efficiency. In fact, this was found to be true, as a 2007 study out of Cologne, Germany, Pistorius was found to use 25-percent less energy than their peers. The report out of JAP, however, reported negligible changes in energy expenditure. The inconsistencies in the findings are attributed to a disparity in study methodology, leading Kram to state that Pistorius' "rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes."
Mechanically
The reduced viscosity of the blade relative to muscle, as well as its lightness, explains why Pistorius demonstrates faster leg swings than their able-bodied peers. In fact, in a competing report to the JAP study (conduct by physiologist Peter Weyland of Southern Methodist University and biomechanist Matthew Bundle of the University of Wyoming), it was found that the carbon-fiber blades allow Pistorius to reposition their limbs 15.7-percent faster than the most recent world record holders in the 100-meter dash. This enables for a 15- to 30-percent increase in sprint speed.
To make matters even more partisan, the structure of the blade appears to have a longer functional lever arm than that of the human foot (i.e., the point of contact is further away from the axes of rotation -- lower extremity joints -- than the typical contact point of the foot). This allows for a larger generation of torque when an identical magnitude of force is applied (torque = force x lever arm). The catch-22, however, is that Pistorius does not exert as much force during push-off from the ground as an able-bodied runner. While this would appear to negate any advantage that they may possess, attributed to the springy, elastic-like structure of the blades, Pistorius requires less than half of the muscle force and 20-percent less ground forces to attain the same running speeds as able-bodied runners.

Although first shown in prototype form at the 2015 IWA show, Brno took the wraps off a finished, civilian-market ready Field Pistol at this year's IWA show, in Nuremburg, Germany.
So what is the Field Pistol? It's a long-slide pistol incorporating CZ-75 style controls with a unique calibre (more on that later) and some obvious and interesting design features. For example, while the slide and rail fitment is very CZ-75, the barrel is held in place by a screw-in barrel bushing, which should increase accuracy. Likewise, the sights are very unique, and feature a skeletonized rear sight with an aperture. The front sight is placed in the aperture to obtain a sight picture, while the skeletonized sight assembly allow the shooter to find the front sight when it would otherwise be obscured by the sight.
But the biggest feature is inside the steel frame's full-length dust cover. Where a normal recoil spring and guide rod would be located, the Field Pistol features a unique recoil mitigation system involving a semi-floating counter mass that supposedly reduced muzzle rise and gives the pistol its unique shape. Details are scarce on how it exactly works, but according to Brno it gives the admittedly heavy 3-pound Field Pistol the recoil impulse of a 40 S&W.
So why is that important? Because the Field Pistol shoots one cartridge: Brno's proprietary bottlenecked 7.5 FK pistol round. With bullet weights between 98 and 103 grains and muzzle velocities of around 2,000 feet per second, it largely mimics the ballistics and energy of a .44 Mag. In fact, the 7.5 FK is so powerful that Brno claims it retains enough energy to defeat Class IIIA soft armour at 100 meters. Perhaps even more impressively? Brno also claims that the 7.5 FK Field Pistol will also shoot 1.5” groups at that distance, too… making this one seriously accurate handgun.
Now, with a 6” barrel, the 7.5 FK Field Pistol should breeze through our firearm classification system easily enough. Furthermore, being produced in the Czech Republic means the 7.5 FK Field Pistol will be intriguing to Canadian distributors that are looking for alternatives to the US-dollar, US-produced market they're used to dealing with. The only downside? That proprietary round. Although the pistol will probably be relatively expensive regardless of the currency exchange (it is, remember, one of the most powerful semi-auto pistols on the market) the ammo may force it into the realm of “often fondled, rarely shot” but similarly exotic pistols chambered in things like .454 Casull and .460 S&W, .50 AE, and to a lesser degree, 10mm. But nonetheless, we hope to see it here at some point!

A few years back, cloud computing transformed customer management, giving every small and medium business access to unified data and communication platforms without the need to make heavy investments in IT infrastructure and staff. This time around, the next revolution in the space is being driven by artificial intelligence algorithms that help businesses automate customer outreach and make optimal use of data.
Beneath the surface of the roiling sea of data we're generating hide exceptional business and sales opportunities. But the problem is there's now more information available than limited human resources and legacy tools can handle.
Fortunately, making sense of data, both structured and unstructured, is something that artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly proficient at. While we're still least decades away from human-level synthetic intelligence—AI that will match the human brain in reasoning and decision making—machine learning algorithms, computer vision, natural language processing and generation (NLG/NLP), and other forms of narrow artificial intelligence are proving to be the best complement for human activity.
AI-powered tools are now helping scale the efforts of sales teams by gleaning useful patterns from data, finding successful courses of action, and taking care of the bulk of the work in addressing customer needs and grievances.
AI-powered CRM suites
Main providers of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions have started to invest in the added value of AI. Last year, SalesForce, the leader in the CRM industry, announced Einstein, an AI assistant that, when launched, will be omnipresent across its platform. Einstein puts its AI chops to work to continuously study the flood of data SalesForces collects from sales, e-commerce activity, emails, IoT generated data and social media streams among others. The AI engine will then make suggestions across different use cases. For instance, it helps sales reps focus on the most promising leads based on engagement data analysis, or gives advice on when to trigger email campaigns according to customer response history.
SAP, another top competitor in the field, is also joining the fray by adding AI functionalities to its S/4HANA cloud ERP. The tacked-on features will give automated insights into the business data the system collects. This includes monitoring accounts or preparing lists of top vendors for an organization based on their pricing, past performance and ability to deliver.
Oracle also declared its cloud AI project earlier this year, called Adaptive Intelligence. The initiative involves a series of add-on applications that integrate with its cloud suite. These apps combine third-party data with real-time analytics to optimize decisions and recommendations in various domains. For example, the AI Offers app merges data from the company cloud and the Oracle Data Cloud to extract contextual insights into individual customer behaviors and provide personalized offers as visitors browse websites powered by the Commerce Cloud.
Specialized AI in outbound marketing
Other players are focusing on verticals and optimizing specific disciplines. Growbots, a lead generation platform, uses machine learning algorithms to automate the prospecting process and marketing campaigns. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to scan websites and gather publicly available information, and enrich its database of profiles about people and businesses. Growbots incorporates this information with client CRM data to identify new potential customers and create tailored prospect lists. The platform integrates with SalesForce and uses AI to enhance and automate email marketing, creating tailored emails for customers, scheduling campaigns and sending follow ups at opportune times. The AI engine uses Natural Language Processing to parse responses and channel positive replies to the sales team.
Such solutions can be a boon to salespersons who are under constant pressure to meet quotas. By enhancing and automating the routine-based parts of the business process, AI-powered tools enable sales teams to focus on their efforts on better serving the more complicated and human-demanding needs of customers. Over time, as these solutions continue to process company and customer data, they become more efficient in their functionality.
Another example is Conversica, an AI-powered assistant that functions like a sales employee and reaches out to anyone who has shown interest in the company, such as by downloading a whitepaper or requesting information from the website. The assistant processes reply from customers, determines feedback and potential questions and crafts a meaningful reply. The assistant passes off the lead to a human salesperson when the time is right.
AI-powered customer service chatbots
Another interesting development in the space is the advent of customer service chatbots, which have become more popular in recent years. Powered by AI algorithms, these bots are becoming much more efficient at independently identifying and resolving customer problems through natural conversation. These assistants free up staff time for more critical and complicated tasks.
Amelia is a virtual customer assistant that uses natural language processing to understand customer queries and provide answer based on data gathered from previous interactions and the company knowledge base. According to estimates, Amelia solves 55 percent of incidents. When it doesn't have an answer or senses a frustration or hostility, it will pass on to a human operator.
Soul Machines, a eerily named startup based in New Zealand, is creating chatbots with expressive digital faces that understand and manifest human emotion. Nadia, the first iteration of their technology, uses AI algorithms to discern human tone and facial expression. The developers believe these chatbots will eventually create a richer experience and be able to engage customers at a much more personal level.
These are some of the trends that are transforming the ways businesses interact with their customers. AI-powered customer support and management will surely result in more satisfied and less frustrated customers, and more productive sales teams. We expect to see more exciting developments in the space in the coming months.

Campaigners have sided with a London council in its fight to force a developer to rebuild a historic pub brick by brick.
The Friends of Carlton Tavern are backing Westminster Council in its push to have the Carlton Tavern in Maida Vale rebuilt to look exactly how it did before it was torn down.
The pub was demolished illegally by developers CLTX last April while it was being considered for Grade II listed status, opponents claim.
A planning inquiry, set to last several days, is now underway to decide on the future of the pub.
John Simmance, from the Friends of Carlton Tavern, told the Standard: "Our hope is to have the pub rebuilt as it was before it was demolished and we support the decision by Westminster City Council to make CLTX do so.
"We think it can be the pub we knew and loved again. We think it can be rebuilt as it was with the materials that are available to do that. We do think that is possible.
"I was so angry when it was demolished. My first thought was we have to do something about it. So we initially painted on the hoarding saying they had destroyed our pub.
"It was vandalism and thuggery on a large scale."
Councillor Rita Begum, who represents Maida Vale, said the demolition of the pub was "unlawful".
They told the Standard: "The pub was purchased and then demolished with little or no regard for the people in the community.
"My hopes are to make sure CLTX don't get away with such an awful thing. They should rebuild it brick by brick and I want Westminster City Council to enforce that.
"It will be a lesson to learn from in years to come. I think if we get what we want, we will me making history."
Westminster City Council, which is pushing for the pub to be rebuilt, refused planning permission for the demolition and redevelopment of the Carlton Tavern in January 2015.
On March 31 last year, Historic England undertook a 48 hour consultation to consider the pub for listed status.
The consultation was extended until April 13, but five days before the end of the consultation, the pub was demolished without prior notification.
Saira Kabir Sheikh QC, representing Westminster City Council, told the planning inquiry: "It was a flagrant breach of planning control and building regulations with the single aim of frustrating the designation of the pub as a grade II listed building, which Historic England had confirmed it would have been very likely to recommend.
"The importance of the Carlton Tavern was properly understood by all in advance of its unlawful demolition, including the appellant.
"In addition to the heritage harm caused by the demolition, weight must also be given to the loss of a community facility, which has since been registered as an asset of community value."
Ms Kabir Sheikh added the breach of planning control can "plainly" only be remedied by rebuilding the pub.
CLTX have appealed to the Planning Inspectorate to be granted retrospective planning permission for their development and are also appealing the enforcement action forcing them to rebuild the pub.
The developer argues the pub was not a listed building when it was demolished and is not within a conservation area.
The planning inquiry at Westminster City Hall is expected to last four or five days.
The outcome of the hearing is expected in late summer.
"In deeming a select group of banks 'too big to fail,' Washington saved Wall Street from collapse, but as a result, unelected bureaucrats and overregulation handcuffed community banks, regional banks, credit unions and other lenders."
Our smaller communities and hopeful entrepreneurs have been shut out. Those who are seeking to start or grow their small business are incapable of accessing the capital necessary to merely plant both feet on the ground. Favorable stock market figures aren't translating to the average American's paycheck.
The celebrated American Dream of starting a business and attaining true financial independence is not achievable for these individuals because President Obama and Dodd-Frank's America put big cities and big banks first.
The poorly-constructed, 2,000-page Dodd-Frank Act has ballooned to 25,000 pages of rules and regulations. It appears Washington forgot that real people rely on banks to access the capital they need to finance their businesses, educations and homes.
In deeming a select group of banks "too big to fail," Washington saved Wall Street from collapse, but as a result, unelected bureaucrats and overregulation handcuffed community banks, regional banks, credit unions and other lenders.
These smaller financial institutions have their hands tied with onerous regulations and high compliance costs, and their ability to loan money is constrained.
To provide the relief these Americans need, Congress must roll back some of the heavy-handed Dodd-Frank provisions.
That is the only way to fuel our economic engine in West Tennessee and across the country.
In 2010, I joined the board of BankTennessee, a community bank in West Tennessee. It is no secret that this was an unfavorable time to join a bank board, as it was just two years after the financial crisis. The economy was stagnant, and banks across the country were struggling to resume routine business.
Joining the board of BankTennessee in 2010, the year of Dodd-Frank's fruition, afforded me a unique vantage point to observe six years of the palpable damage the law inflicted on America's small businesses and financial institutions.
After seeing the obstacles BankTennessee and banks across the nation faced following the crisis, I know how important it is to roll back Dodd-Frank so, once again, individuals can access capital.
This was one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress.
After being elected to the House of Representatives, I set my sights on becoming a member of the financial-services committee –a committee enthusiastic about the economic opportunities that lie on the other side of regulatory reform.
Rural communities and our working class — made up of some of the most patriotic and dedicated people in America — have not had the luxury of Washington's protection.
A majority of Americans cited the economy as their number one concern in the voting booth last November. President Donald J. Trump was elected because they recognized that half of America has been left behind in this two-speed economy.
Now, as a member of the financial-services committee, I am working with Chairman Jeb Hensarling and my colleagues on the committee to change the current system.
In our first full committee hearing this February, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen delivered their semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. A couple things stood out to me in their remarks. Chair Yellen said that our nation is at full employment and that, while there is still room for improvement, wages are rising.
Chair Yellen should take a drive through West Tennessee. They would see how that may be true for the half of America that benefitted from Dodd-Frank. Unfortunately, Chair Yellen's evaluation was not considering a dynamic economy — an economy that encourages new businesses, new job creation and new salaries.
In 2014, the number of small businesses added to the economy was 650,000 firms short of the average. That translates to a loss of roughly 6.5 million jobs.
By implementing one-size-fits-all regulations, Washington bureaucrats have made lending nearly impossible for smaller banks, shutting down their ability to empower dependable clients who would reinvest in their communities.
With nowhere else to turn, entrepreneurs and small businesses who do not qualify for bank loans turn to credit cards and home-equity lines of credit, but Dodd-Frank has shut down these avenues, with credit-card issuance at a record low of 50 million fewer accounts than before the recession.
The American people should be in charge of their own economic opportunity, not bureaucrats in Washington.
Now, Congress and the Trump administration have an opportunity to roll back the regulations causing this dichotomy in the American economy.
The financial-services committee has already hit the ground running on legislation that will dismantle Dodd-Frank and open the door for all Americans to achieve financial independence. I am encouraged by the ambitious and productive schedule Chairman Hensarling has mapped out.
Our committee is working to grow the American economy and help put more people back to work with full-time, good-paying jobs.
Dodd-Frank created two Americas, but I see a unified U.S. economy that serves all Americans.

The 43-year-old American actor Mark Ruffalo has reportedly been placed on a 'US terror advisory list' after campaigning in support of a documentary which highlights the dangers of natural gas drilling, reports the UK's Guardian newspaper.
Ruffalo, who recently starred in the hit indie comedy 'The Kids are Alright', organised screenings for the movie 'Gaslands', which won the special jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. However, the actor's attempts to bring the film's topic to a wider audience alerted Pennsylvania's Office of Homeland Security. The documentary in question is directed by JOSH FOX and follows the filmmaker as they visit areas of Pennsylvania where natural gas is being drilled. The director decided to make the film after a gas company wrote to them in 2008 offering to lease their land in Milanville for £64,000.
The documentary courted much interest for one scene in particular which shows a local man being able to set their tap water on fire. Certain members of the community that appear in the film suggest that their health is deteriorating because of the contaminated water. Ruffalo recently finished filming the drama film 'Margaret', which is set for release in 2011 and also stars MATT DAMON.

Easy Pizza Roll-Ups
When I was young, our local pizza shop was famous for their Pizza Rolls, after a day at the beach all the neighborhood surf rats would head straight over for dinner on Saturdays. Their Pizza Rolls were huge, stuffed full of pepperoni and gooey cheese…..Just thinking about them makes my mouth water, good times indeed. The pizza shop is long gone but the memories remain.
I wanted to recreate these awesome pizza rolls for my friends and family, but I am not a pizza chef, so I have put together a super simple recipe that is not only cost efficient and a total time saver, but so very yummy! The cool thing is you can even prep these ahead of time, brush with EVOO & wrap in plastic wrap (so dough wont dry out) to store in fridge then bake later that night or next day!
What you'll need:
1- package Pre-made Pizza Dough (would also be delish with freezer bread dough! Rhodes Bake and Serve would be perfect)
1- jar spaghetti or pizza sauce
shredded mozzarella cheese
1- package sliced pepperoni (or any topping you like)
Pre-Heat oven to 375
Unroll pizza dough and cut in half (or in 1/4s if smaller rolls are desired) Spread sauce evenly over uncooked dough, lay a single layer of pepperoni over sauce, then cover with shredded cheese.
Starting at one end, begin rolling/folding the pizza dough with topping over and over until you reach the end and it looks like a big burrito. Pinch the edge of the dough to seal closed, and tuck the side ends under to seal them too.
Place Pizza roll-ups on a parchment covered cookie sheet, sealed side down. Sprinkle with cheese and place in the preheated oven. (you may brush on some EVOO before the cheese if desired, but doesn't need it) Bake till golden brown (depending on oven – aprox. 20 mins.)
And there you have it! Super easy, supper yummy Pizza Roll-Ups that your whole family will love! Serve with a side of warm sauce for dipping and you're all set – Enjoy!!

A male Great Blue Heron spotted earlier this month with a plastic net stuck on its bill has been found dead in a pond at the Stonebridge Golf and Country Club.
The male Great Blue Heron was first spotted in a human-made pond along the Jock River in Barrhaven earlier this month. (CBC)
The distressed heron was first seen earlier this month by residents along Half Moon Bay on the Jock River.
Its bill was forced to shut by a red plastic net, and it was unable to hunt for food.
People tried to rescue it but when anyone got close, the heron flew away.
Residents thought heron would make it
Photographer Dan Rogall, who lives near Half Moon Bay and had been tracking the bird, said they saw it for the last time about a week ago.
Photographer Dan Rogall said they were shocked when they learned that the heron had been found dead. (CBC)
The net was still stuck on its bill, though the heron could open it more.
They said they thought the heron was going to get the net off, eventually.
People showed up at Half Moon Bay on Wednesday to attempt another rescue, Rogall said, but the heron with the net on its bill couldn't be found. Instead, people spotted about four other herons, all of them with nothing on their bills.
"We kind of suspected that maybe they shook the net and they were fine, however that doesn't seem to be the case," Rogall said Friday. "I got an email last night from a gentleman who was on the golf course and they had spotted the blue heron in the pond on the 12th hole. And then they confirmed that one of their buddies last night saw the same blue heron in the pond, floating."
'I can't imagine starving to death'
Rogall said they were shocked.
"I can't imagine starving to death, and I think that's what happened," they said. "He just became so weak.
"I kind of hope that there's a lesson to be learned from all this. I mean, it is garbage. It's garbage from people. The animals were definitely here way before any of these developments were."
The Canadian Co-operative Wildlife Health Centre will now determine how the heron died.
Once that's done, Rogall said they hope the Great Blue Heron will be buried at Half Moon Bay.
Daniel Theis is an object of considerable interest for Boston Celtics fans, most of whom haven't had a chance to watch the German big man during their time overseas.
Austin Ainge, Celtics' director of player personnel, told the Boston Sports Journal's Brian Robb over the weekend that they believe Theis is ready to break out in the NBA.
Here's Ainge:
Daniel has been a prospect for a number of years now. He's a guy that has just slowly gotten better. They kept working on their game, kept improving. Now at age 25, he's ready to make the leap. He's won three German championships in a row and plays a lot at the 4 and 5. They can shoot 3s, he's athletic and he's a national team player, so he's very experienced for a 25-year-old.
Ainge added that they didn't have a good player comparison for Theis, but noted that the 6-foot-9 big can play both the four and five while also switching some to contain pick-and-rolls.
Ainge's assessment seems fair based on the limited clips the internet can provide. In 30 Euroleague games last season, Theis went 16-for-39 behind the arc for an impressive 41 percent clip (albeit in a small sample size). Their shot looks good -- they have compact form and great rotation, and their ability to play in the pick-and-roll should make them a potential stretch big as a pop threat as well.
Theis is also relatively athletic -- an alley-oop target out of the pick-and-roll, and a shot blocker from the weak side. He's not overly tall, but the eye test would indicate that their wingspan is long (there doesn't seem to be a documented wingspan available online). Theis isn't a DeAndre Jordan-esque deterrent at the rim by any means, but as a three-time Defensive Player of the Year in the German league, he'll collect their fair share of blocks.
One of the more impressive aspects to Theis' game is their timing on both ends. As a roll man, they set excellent screens (that are often illegal, frankly -- we'll see if they start getting called in the NBA).
Here, they pause for a split second to ensure that both the big and the guard are trying to defend the ball-handler before they roll down the middle of an open lane to the hoop.
That little bit of patience buys them an easy basket. NBA defenses are far more advanced, but it's a positive sign that they can be a high pick-and-roll/pick-and-pop threat.
Defensively, Theis does a nice job making the most of their bounce, especially from the weak side. They can make life a little more difficult for driving ball-handlers, which -- paired with Al Horford's positioning -- could earn them a rotation spot.
There's no guarantee that Theis' skill set translates to NBA playing time, of course. The NBA is much more advanced than the Bundesliga, and Theis will be matched up with the toughest competition of their life by a pretty significant margin. But they have some intriguing tools, and as Ainge noted, they have real experience. At the price Boston paid to acquire him, Theis could be a productive contributor.
Scientists have discovered a new class of cosmic energy in outer space — nearly 10,000 bursts of radio waves popping off every day — but where they come from and how they occur are still a mystery
Dr Jon Heras /Science Photo / Corbis Illustration showing the absorbance of electromagnetic waves by the Earth's atmosphere.
It's a recurring theme in astronomy: observers see a blast of energy out in the cosmos, scratch their heads in confusion for a while, and finally uncover the existence of something entirely surprising and new. It happened with the quasars (now known to be gigantic burps from black holes swallowing hot gas), the pulsars (fast-spinning neutron stars sending out blips of radio noise hundreds of times every second), and even the Big Bang itself, first seen as a stream of microwaves slamming into Earth from all directions, nearly 14 billion years after the event itself.
Now it may be happening again. Back in 2007, astronomers detected a burst of radio noise, lasting maybe a second or so, the cause of which was totally unclear. There was reason to suspect it came from beyond the Milky Way, and must be extremely powerful to be visible at all. But it never repeated, and neither did a second, similar blast seen in 2011, making it very tough to puzzle out what was going on. Maybe both events were just some sort of rare fluke.
(MORE: The Great, Belching Black Hole — Eats Gas, Burps X-rays)
But a new paper in Science makes that seem very unlikely. Using the giant Parkes radio telescope in Australia, astronomers have recorded four more of these mysterious bursts, and when the scientists extrapolated across the entire sky, they concluded that perhaps 10,000 of these blasts are popping off every day, all over the heavens. “It's still a mystery what they are,” says lead author Dan Thornton, of the University of Manchester, in the U.K. “But at least it's not a mystery that they exist.” In fact, Thornton and their co-authors claim that the observations reveal what they call a “new cosmological population” of energy blasts, whose true nature is unknown.
At the time of the first observations, back in 2007, there was some talk that the original burst might have come from inside the Milky Way. There was a way to test that proposition: radio outbursts generally come in a range of frequencies — channels, essentially, like those on a radio dial. As they speed through the empty spaces in our galaxy, the waves run into loose electrons that linger between the stars. The electrons slow the radio waves down a bit, with the lowest-frequency waves slowing the most. A radio burst that was emitted in a fraction of a second might be received over a longer period, depending on how far the burst had been traveling, and through what part of the Milky Way.
(VIDEO: Looking Through the World's Largest Telescope)
The first and second bursts were indeed spread out, or dispersed, this way, and the first, especially, seemed to be too dispersed to have originated in our own galaxy. But the second was marginal, leaving astronomers stuck. The four new blasts, however, were unmistakable. “The dispersion is so high,” says Thornton, “that from what we know, they could not have come from the Milky Way.”
Instead, they say, they and their co-authors estimate that whatever is sending out these radio bursts is located between five and10 billion light-years away — a substantial fraction of the way out to the edge of the visible universe.
(MORE: Meet the Itsy-Bitsy, Teeny-Weeny Galaxy)
So that's the “where” of the mystery, but nobody has a good idea yet about the “what.” Some of the possibilities of the blasts cause include: evaporating black holes (something predicted by Stephen Hawking), or giant black holes eating neutron stars. Or, writes Cornell astronomer James Cordes, tantalizingly, in a commentary also appearing in Science, “they could represent an entirely new class of source.”
The only way to figure it out is to follow up on the radio bursts with observations by visible-light, X-ray and other telescopes to try and get a glimpse of whatever's going on from another perspective. That's how astronomers figured out the inner workings of gamma-ray bursts, which turned out to be a special kind of exploding star — and just as with gamma-ray bursts, it will be important to do those follow-ups quickly. “We discovered these events about a year after they happened,” says Thornton, by which time any lingering visible or X-ray glow from the triggering event would long since have faded. “But now we're working on real-time alerts.”
If those can be organized — and given the fact that one of these blasts probably goes off about once every second around the clock — it might not be long before pulsars, quasars, gamma-ray bursts and other blasts of cosmic energy welcome a new cousin to the family.

We essentially have a three-way tie for first place this weekend, as Tom Cruise's American Made, Fox's Kingsman: The Golden Circle and New Line's It all earned around $17 million. I'm sure it'll be a nail-biter when the actual figures come in tomorrow, but all three films are operating on different planes of expectations. Heck, those three films are in their first, second and fourth respective weekends of release, making them more or less impressive with said $17m Fri-Sun haul. So, all due respect, I'm more impressed by It snagging a $17m fourth weekend than by American Made snagging a $17m opening weekend. Rank often doesn't matter, but it really doesn't matter in a situation like this one.
Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc.'s It had a terrific hold in its fourth weekend, earning $17.3 million (-42%) and bringing its 24-day total to $291.183m. It'll pass The Sixth Sense ($292m in 1999) in a day or two to become the biggest scary movie ever in North America (not accounting for inflation) save for Jurassic Park ($402m) and Jurassic World ($623m). And that ridiculously small 42% fourth-weekend drop, even with two big R-rated actioners in the marketplace, show further evidence that the film is playing as an adult horror film and as a teen "rites of passage" first R-rated horror flick. It should pass $300m domestic sometime next weekend. And with a record-crushing $11.6m debut in Germany (to paraphrase Norm McDonald, Germans love Pennywise!), It has earned $$553.1m worldwide thus far.
That already makes it the eighth-biggest R-rated movie of all time worldwide, behind only Fifty Shades of Grey ($571 million), The Hangover part II ($586m), Passion of the Christ ($611m), Logan ($620m), The Matrix Revolutions ($742m), Deadpool ($783m) and the $870m+ Wolf Warrior 2 (technically unrated, but it's not getting a PG-13 even if they change all that blood to sweat). And in terms of global grosses for even somewhat scary movies (I'm being generous), it sits behind only Jurassic World ($1.6 billion), Jurassic Park ($1b), Gravity ($723m), The Sixth Sense ($692m), The Lost World: Jurassic Park ($618m), War of the Worlds ($592m), I Am Legend ($585m) and Kong: Skull Island ($566m). You may say Kong and Gravity don't count, but I'm sure the studio beyond those won't care too much.
Fox's Kingsman: The Secret Service earned another $17 million in weekend two, dropping 56% from its $39m debut weekend. Yes, it's a bigger drop than Kingsman: The Secret Service, which earned $18m and fell 49% in its second weekend. To be fair, The Secret Service had a $41m Fri-Mon debut and its ten-day total of $67.9m is pretty close to The Golden Circle's $66.7m ten-day cume. But, yeah, The Golden Circle is a sequel with a lot less buzz and lesser reviews, so expect it to take a hit next weekend against Blade Runner 2049 and The Mountain Between Us. The $104 million action sequel should crawl to $100m domestic, so the question is whether it can make up the relative difference overseas. With $193m worldwide thus far, it's making a run at it, although a total under the original's $414m global total wouldn't exactly be a disaster for Fox and friends.
Sadly the same can't be said for The LEGO Ninjago Movie. The WB animated film earned $12 million (-41%). That's an okay hold, but the numbers weren't great to begin with. Its second-weekend total, second-weekend drop and $35.55m ten-day total puts it behind even Storks ($13.4m/-36%/$38m) respective figures. Once again, a wholly original animated feature is outperforming a branded title at the domestic box office. That's... interesting.
Fox Searchlight expanded Battle of the Sexes into 1,213 theaters this weekend to disappointing results. The buzzy and well-received dramedy about the 1973 tennis match between Billy Jean King (Emma Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell) earned just $3.4 million over the second frame for a $4m ten-day cume. That's a miserable $2,811 per-location-average, and about on with the per-screen-average about on par with Birth of a Nation and well below the expansions/debuts of Wild ($4.1m in 1,061 theaters), 12 Years A Slave ($6.6m/1,144) and The Grand Budapest Hotel ($8.5m/977). It needs some long legs or Oscar buzz to not vanish from theaters.
The film is pretty darn good (it works as a coming out story and then as a Rocky IV remake), and it's certainly a crowdpleaser. But it is receiving polite buzz rather than ecstatic excitement. Although (clears throat) it's getting better notices from female critics than male ones. Nonetheless, the Oscar season is thus far without any real frontrunner, and we're still in a crazy situation where the vast bulk of the would-be contenders will end up with less than Wind River ($32 million), which may itself make that Jeremy Renner/Elizabeth Olsen drama into a contender. Lionsgate and CBS Films' American Assassin earned $3.3m (-47%) and a 17-day total of $31.8m. That's not great, but the hope is that the $33m, R-rated actioner can kick it up a notch overseas.
Open Road Films' Home Again earned $1.7 million (-45%) in its fourth weekend for a $25.1m 24-day total. That's now a blow-out, but the $12m Reese Witherspoon dramedy may be slightly profitable in the end. Paramount/Viacom Inc. continues to try and fight the good fight with mother!, but the Jennifer Lawrence/Javier Bardem horror pic earned $1.4m (-55%) in its third weekend for a $16.3m 17-day total. We'll see if the $30m Darren Aronofsky release can do better overseas (it has $18.5m thus far), but this one is just about finished in domestic theaters.
Victoria and Abdul earned $1.031 million from 77 theaters for a strong $13,393 per-location average and a $1.252m 17-day total. It will expand to 700 theaters next weekend. David Gordon Green's Stronger earned just $941,000 (-42%) in its second weekend for a $3.18 million-day total. Unless Jake Gyllenhaal gets an Oscar nomination, it's curtains for this one. Friend Request earned around $776k (-61%) in its second weekend for a $3.46m ten-day cume. Finally, Girls Trip will end the weekend just over the $115m domestic mark while The Hitman's Bodyguard will end just under $75m in North America.
That's a wrap for this weekend, The next frame will see WB and Sony's Blade Runner 2049 face off against Lionsgate's My Little Pony: The Movie and Fox's The Mountain Between Us.
Treasurer Joe Hockey is continuing to throw rocks from the cheap seats rather than manage a huge structural transition in our $1.5tr economy.
Their hyper-exaggeration of a "debt crisis" and a "budget emergency" continues. Australia faces no such prospect.
Net debt in Australia is one of the lowest of any advanced economy, as the graph below demonstrates. That's why Australia has a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies. There is a world of difference between debt levels in Australia and debt levels in the United States.
The divisive and catastrophic debt debate in the United States shows what goes wrong when economic discussion and sensible public policy is hijacked by hyper-partisan language of the type repeated by Mr Hockey today.
It's damaging to confidence within a nation and standing within the global economy.
Over the past 18 months in the United States a Tea Party faction in the US Republican Party has been prepared to shut down the U S Government and hold the global economy to ransom. This could have caused the United States to default on its debt obligations and a global economic meltdown would have followed.
The Tea Party rhetoric about the size and role that debt plays in modern government is aimed at abolishing the social safety net, in particular health care for uninsured Americans. The equivalent of these events in Australia would be to defund Medicare and stop the roll out of disability care because it is funded by the Medicare levy.
Government net debt per capita
Yet again Mr Hockey didn't choose today to acknowledge the strength of Australia's fiscal position as the government moves to increase Australia's debt cap.
During the global financial crisis and recession, when demand fell off a cliff, Australia activated stimulus measures to support consumption and to invest in infrastructure to support jobs and growth. In doing this Australia sensibly borrowed to support our economy. It was a modest price to pay to maintain the strongest economic fundamentals of any developed economy. Since 2009, the Labor government put in place significant fiscal consolidation, recognising the importance of a clear pathway back to surplus.
As the pre-election fiscal outlook shows, this path of consolidation has brought down budget deficits progressively to enable a clear pathway to surplus and the elimination of net debt.
Last year a sudden drop in corporate tax revenue meant that the Government took the responsible position to slow the path back to surplus by two years.
Hockey and their colleagues have repeatedly said that debt was because of Labor's “legacy of waste and reckless spending”. This statement is untrue.
In 2013-14, Australia remains within the debt cap legislated in May 2012 and it was always the case that it would have to be lifted as gross debt peaked at $370bn over the next four years. Today Mr Hokey said that this figure had increased by $30bn. But as a matter of government choice they added an additional $100bn to the debt cap.
This is not a consequence of Labor's commitment in the 2013-14 budget to implement and fund DisabilityCare and the Gonski School Improvement Program. Both were fully funded by Labor for the next decade.
If Mr Hockey has a spending problem, it's of their own creation. They intend to substantially reduce government revenues by abolishing the MRRT, the carbon price and reinstating tax breaks through the the fringe benefit tax. They also plan to spend big on the world's most expensive paid parental leave scheme.
These policies are a triumph for wealthy miners, big polluters and high income wage earners. While this is an agenda that is not as nihilistic as the United States Tea Party, it is an agenda that reeks of fiscal irresponsibility, the beneficiaries of which are those on the highest incomes.
It will have to be funded in the long run by large cuts to the social safety net and key investments in education and health. Their commission of audit announced today will be used to camouflage this fiscal recklessness. In fact, Tony Shephard, who the government appointed today to run the commission of audit, is on the record time and time again advocating an increase in the GST and reducing conditions and penalty rates for Australian workers. Mark my words, the losers from Hockey's commission of cuts will be those on modest and middle incomes dependent upon quality health and educational services to lift their living standards and those of future generations.
Australia will still hear plenty from Mr Hockey about debt and deficit caused by irresponsible Labor spending.
In truth, our deficits are modest and our spending responsible. The Liberals have different priorities and what the Abbott government and its commission of audit is really about is hacking away at public investment in health and education and the social safety net.
One of a handful of black students in their high school near Canton, Ohio, in the 1950s, Delores Henderson was pulled into a joke by a fellow classmate.
The student, who was white, told their history teacher that they and Henderson had married over the weekend. The teacher's white face turned even paler, and they held the two students after class, where they stated clearly their disapproval of interracial marriage.
“That was my first (encounter) where it was so open with racism,” Henderson said.
They learned then that she'd have to fight for equal treatment for all and pledged that everyone who met them would know “who I was and what I stood for,” they said.
Henderson, principal of St. Paul's Hazel Park Preparatory Academy, received the Charles L. Hopson Racial Equity Principal Leadership award from the Pacific Educational Group last week in New Orleans. The award caps a career of educational equity work in a city and school system that hadn't given it much attention until recently.
Henderson recalled a speaker at the start of the 1982 school year who forecast a shift in demographics and encouraged St. Paul Public Schools administrators to begin training their teachers accordingly. Today, with minorities accounting for 76 percent of student enrollment and nearly 73 percent of all students eligible for school lunch subsidies, nearly everything district administrators do is viewed through an “equity lens.”
“We're doing the work now,” they said.
Henderson is decidedly hands-on, and that goes beyond hugging students in the hallway.
“Her energy and enthusiasm are incredible,” said Christine Osorio, the district's chief academic officer, who used to be Henderson's direct supervisor. “She never stops. I've never seen anything like it.”
When a child's grades are slipping, Henderson will call their parents and demand to know why the teacher hadn't done so first. Now, their teachers are required to make notes on their communications with parents, and Henderson is auditing their logs.
They and their equity team will be training teachers on how to make classes culturally relevant for students. They check lesson plans to make sure teachers are on the right path.
Henderson's high expectations contribute to high turnover, they admitted — Hazel Park teachers often leave to work elsewhere.
Science teacher Carlottia Davis agreed their principal is tough but said Henderson “makes me better.”
Expectations are high for students, too. As Henderson walks the halls of the school for prekindergarteners through eighth-graders, they compliment a child whose behavior has improved. They ask another if he's getting their grades up and makes a note to follow up when they say yes.
They recently brought the National Junior Honor Society program to Hazel Park and is working to make Hazel Park an International Baccalaureate school, as well. A longtime educator of gifted and talented students, they said they believe every child is gifted. And they subscribe to Harvard researcher Howard Gardner's multiple-intelligences theory, which for schools requires finding the learning style that works best for each child.
Henderson has been on the job long enough that they would make more money if they were retired. Next school year will be their 50th, and if Hazel Park gets International Baccalaureate authorization, Henderson said they think they will step down.
“I probably will retire from the school district but not from this work,” they said.
Osorio said they don't see how Henderson could quit. “Until the achievement gap is closed, she's not going to stop working on that,” they said.

From top: Members of the Irish Defence Forces take part in a parade for the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising in Dublin last Easter; Derek Mooney
The author shoots down the prospect of a Europe Army and urges a fact-based assessment of Ireland's defence needs.
FIGHT!
Derek Mooney writes:
Though you may not have noticed it – there was, over the last few weeks, an attempt to start a public debate on Irish Defence policy. While the Irish Examiner, in particular, did its level best to get it going, the discussion soon fizzled out.
The reason why the debate never really got going may be due to the fact that we tend to only discuss defence policy in public in response to some significant event or, more frequently, to some outlandish and unfounded claim.
On the rare occasions that we have any debate on defence in Ireland, they tend to be either end of the extreme ranging from claims that we are abandoning neutrality, a claim made continuously since the 1970s, to questions as to why we even have a Defence Force.
Though there is a real and clear public pride in our Defence Forces, both at home and abroad, there is also a surprising paucity of knowledge about Defence policy.
With this in mind, I want to use this week's Broadsheet.ie offering to put some basic facts about Irish Defence policy out there, in the vain hope that the next public debate on Defence may be based on fact and reality, not myth and assertion.
Let's start with a few basics.
The Irish Defence Forces comprise the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and should total 9,500 men and women. The current manpower figure as set out in a parliamentary reply to Fianna Fáil's Lisa Chambers, is just under 9100.
There are approximately 460 Irish troops currently serving overseas on a range of UN led and mandated peace-keeping and humanitarian missions.
These include: 60 naval service personnel on the humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean; about 210 troops on the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon and approx 140 troops serving in the UNDOF mission on the Golan Heights in Syria.
Though these numbers are way down from the average of 800 plus personnel serving overseas less than a decade ago, it still represents a sizeable Irish contribution to international peace and security, which in turn contributes to our own national security.
We spend about €900 million per year on Defence, though the vast bulk (over 70%) is accounted for by wages and pensions.
When it comes to value for money the Defence Forces lead the way.
The reform and modernisation programme undertaken between 2001 and 2010 make it a model of how public sector reform can be done right. Productivity was increased, numbers were reduced and the savings were invested in vastly improved equipment and training.
Now let's turn to the policy side. First and foremost, Ireland is militarily neutral. While this is usually defined as not being a member of a military alliance, it also means that we decide for ourselves how much we spend on defence and – most importantly – how, where and when we deploy our troops overseas on humanitarian and peace-keeping/peace enforcement operations.
This is done via the “Triple-Lock” mechanism of UN mandate, Cabinet and Dáil approval. Triggering this triple lock is required before 12 or more Defence Force personnel are deployed overseas under arms.
This enshrines not only our military neutrality but our commitment to multilateralism and the UN.
We use the phrase UN mandated, which means that a UN resolution is required. Nowadays many UN mandated missions are not UN led, i.e. “blue helmet”, but rather led by regional organisations – such as the EU, The African Union, NATO etc – on behalf of the UN. This was the case in the 2008 EU For Chad mission, which was commanded by an Irishman, Gen. Pat Nash.
I was in the Dept. of Defence during the Chad/Central African Republic mission, which was established to deal with the crisis created in the region on foot of the Darfur famine.
I saw how the Triple Lock was implemented smoothly and speedily. UN resolution 1778 was passed at the end of Sept 2007, Cabinet Approval was given in October, unanimous Dáil approval by the end of November and by December an initial deployment of Army Rangers and support elements were on the ground in Eastern Chad establishing the Irish Camp.
Any difficulties in deployment were not due to the Irish or the Triple Lock but rather to the frustrating slowness of other EU countries, particularly the non-neutral ones, to respond especially when it came to offering air and medical support to the mission.
Nothing I saw at those defence meetings in Brussels led me to think that an EU Army was a realistic possibility, leaving aside the fact that we have a veto (EU requires unanimity on common defence) on it and that the Irish Constitution (Art 29.4.9) precludes Irish membership of a common defence.
Speaking of air support brings me back to the Irish Examiner article mentioned at the outset. From my perspective this appears to be based on the inaccurate, if not sensationalised misreading, of an already inaccurate report.
I say inaccurate as the original material suggests that is not Ireland which has asked the RAF to protect our airspace from terrorist threats, but rather that it is the British who have asked for Irish permission to fly into our airspace in the event of terrorist air attacks heading for Britain.
When viewed this way the story is not quite as sensational, nor is it the slam dunk argument for Ireland rushing out and purchasing a fleet of F-16s.
I am not absolutely opposed to our buying a few F-16s – though if we are going to go into the fighter aircraft market why not opt for some newer F-35s?
I am sure the Air Corps would be overjoyed to have them, though I suspect the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure might baulk at the tripling or quadrupling of annual defence expenditure necessary to keep these fighters in the air 24/7, especially when we consider the real and actual threat assessments.
So, let us have a full debate on defence (and foreign) policy by all means, but let us ground it in fact and reality.

“Black Lightning” has nabbed an official pilot order at the CW, Variety has learned.
The Greg Berlanti-produced series was originally was developed at Fox earlier this season, landing a hefty pilot production commitment from the get-go. Insiders tell Variety the network passed on the project earlier this week, so then it moved to the CW.
Should “Black Lightning” go to series, it would mark the fifth DC superhero show from Berlanti at the CW, which is currently home to “Arrow,” “The Flash,” DC's Legends of Tomorrow” and Supergirl,” which have all been renewed for the 2017-2018 season.
If “Black Lightning” is greenlit for 2017-2018, sources close to the network explain that the shows would be staggered throughout the year, rather than scheduling five separate nights of superhero programming.
“Black Lightning” is the second Berlanti Productions series to move from another network to the CW. After “Supergirl's” first season struggled to keep a big enough audience for CBS' standards, the younger-skewing sister network picked it up for its sophomore season. While superhero programming may not be the best fit for the Big Four, the CW has had great success with its four series, including “Supergirl,” which is performing strongly in its second season at the CW, only behind the net's top show, “The Flash.”

Back at the Television Critics Association press tour last summer, CW chief Mark Pedowitz was asked about the possibility of another superhero show. They said: “At the moment, we were only expecting to have four this season…At this time there's no real discussions about any other superhero characters, but one of the things about the Arrowverse…we get to see all these characters. Now, if someone pops, then you reexamine the situation, but at this time, there are no discussions with anybody else.”
Based on the DC character, “Black Lightning” is about Jefferson Pierce. They made their choice: they hung up the suit and their secret identity years ago, but with a daughter hell-bent on justice and a star student being recruited by a local gang, he'll be pulled back into the fight as the wanted vigilante and DC legend, Black Lightning.
The original comic character was created by Tony Isabella with Trevor Von Eeden. The TV pilot was written by Salim Akil and Mara Brock Akil, who will serve as executive producers with Berlanti and producing partner Sarah Schechter. Berlanti Prods. and Akil Prods. are producing with Warner Bros. Television.
The intersection of digital money and traditional finance is at 400 South LaSalle Street in Chicago this weekend. That's where trading in bitcoin futures opens Sunday evening, as the first major U.S. exchange offers a product pegged to the wildly fluctuating cryptocurrency.
The currency has risen more than 1,500 percent this year, and about 85 percent just in the past two weeks, driven largely by demand from individual investors. But even as bitcoin — launched in 2009 as an alternative to banks — divides Wall Street executives and central bankers worldwide, those kinds of gains are a powerful magnet.
The futures offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc., and similar contracts that start trading in a week at at another Chicago-based exchange, CME Group Inc., may open the door to greater inflows of institutional money, while also making it easier to bet on bitcoin's decline. Either way, it's likely trading will start slowly, said Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Investment Partners, which is raising a crypto hedge fund targeted at $500 million.
“If people have expectations that it's going to have huge liquidity on day one, they're just wrong,” Novogratz said Thursday in Toronto. “It's going to take a while to build liquidity. People need to go through at least one cycle to figure out how it settles.”
Derivatives trading is the culmination of a wild year for bitcoin, which captured imaginations and investment around the world, propelled by its stratospheric gains, and its anti-establishment mission as a currency without the backing of a government or a central bank, and a payment system without a reliance on banks. The derivatives contracts should thrust bitcoin more squarely into the realm of regulators, banks and institutional investors. In addition to the contracts at Cboe and CME, which will start trading Dec. 18, Cantor Fitzgerald LP won approval from regulators to trade binary options, and LedgerX, a startup exchange, already trades bitcoin options.
“There will be a ramp-up time,” said Ari Paul, chief investment officer of Blocktower Capital Advisors LP. “There just isn't a rush. The professional traders will mostly be looking to do arbitrage, between the futures and bitcoin itself. I don't expect massive money flows right away but then I expect gradual buying from people who want passive exposure” without buying bitcoin directly.
The two exchanges on Dec. 1 got permission to offer the contracts after pledging to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the products don't run afoul of the law, in a process called self-certification.
“Derivatives should have the effect of bringing a deeper liquidity to the market which should reduce volatility,” said Alistair Milne, chief investment officer and co-founder of Altana Digital Currency Fund that is based in Monaco. “As the whole cryptocurrency economy gets bigger the volatility should reduce.”
But not everyone is convinced it's a good idea. On Dec. 6, the Futures Industry Association — a group of major banks, brokers and traders — said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. Last month, Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire chairperson of Interactive Brokers Group Inc., wrote an open letter to CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, arguing that bitcoin's large price swings mean its futures contracts shouldn't be allowed on platforms that clear other derivatives.
Still, Interactive Brokers will offer its customers access to the futures, though with greater restrictions. They won't be able to go short — betting that prices will decline — and Interactive's margin requirement, or how many investors have to set aside as collateral, will be at least 50 percent. That's higher than either Cboe's or CME's margin requirements.
Cboe's futures are cash-settled and based on the Gemini auction price for bitcoin in U.S. dollars. The exchange plans to impose trading limits to curb volatility, halting trading for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and a five-minute halt kicks in at 20 percent. Margins for Cboe bitcoin futures, which will be cleared by Options Clearing Corp., will be at 40 percent or higher.
Cboe's futures market is a niche player in derivatives trading, which could limit how many contracts change hands in the initial days. Fueled by contracts on the VIX, the Cboe Futures Exchange handled 56 million contracts during the first three quarters of 2017, according to data compiled by the Futures Industry Association, the industry's trade and lobbying group. CME traded 3.1 billion contracts in the same period.
Some traders also will prefer CME contracts over Cboe's because they're based off four exchanges, instead of just one, reducing risk of disruptions because of outages, attacks or price manipulations.
The smaller Cboe does have an advantage over CME Group, however, because it's a major player in stock and equity options trading, giving it access to broker-dealers and investors who may not trade on CME.
In a league where coaches and GMs are often held to the mantra “what have you done for me lately,” Brian Cashman's seat should be getting hot right about now. They recently made headlines for stating in an on-record interview that Alex Rodriguez should “shut the f@&k up” in response to Rodriguez sending a tweet and an accompanying photo about how excited they were to be making progress with their rehab. Previously Cashman's mishaps had been for the most part been contained to abysmal personnel decisions, but their public faux pas has drawn the ire of A-Rod and the front office. It would be one thing if Cashman had a track record of success, but over the past decade he's been known much more for signing players to overpriced contracts that don't pan out than winning ball games.
Since 2003 the Bronx Bombers have consistently made the playoffs with one World Series to show for it, and for all but one season have posted a good record. They have done all of this, however, in spite of Cashman who has done their best to sabotage the team by bloating the payroll with aging has-beens. Hideki Irabu, Randy Johnson, Carl Pavano, Kevin Brown, Javier Vazquez (twice), Kei Igawa, A.J. Burnett, Curtis Granderson; the list goes on. Even Rodriguez despite having an amazing career is clearly being paid way too much money and with Sabathia they are just barely breaking even in terms of WAR obtained for dollars spent. With A-Rod out you'd at least hope that Granderson and Mark Teixeira could give the team some type of return on investment, but as it stands they are replacement level players at best. Even the team's record this year (currently they are 8 games over .500) is all smoke and mirrors because they have a run differential of 0!
Cashman supporters will point to the team's World Series rings and regular season wins as proof of their competency. In reality, Cashman inherited the team that won most of those rings, and has managed to keep the team competitive despite their poor personnel decisions because of the team's seemingly bottomless wallet. New York would be much better-served to find someone who wastes even half as much money as Cashman does, and who has a tame enough ego that they don't spend tons of money on players who don't justify that level of compensation. At the very least you'd expect Cashman to keep their mouth shut while he's sinking the Yankees' ship, but these days it appears they can't even do that anymore.
100% code coverage is enough
Code coverage seems to be a bad indicator for the quality of the tests. Take the following code as an example:
public void testEmptySum() { assertEquals(0, sum()); } public void testSumOfMultipleNumbers() { assertEquals(5, sum(2, 3)); }
Now take a look at the implementation:
public int sum(int...numbers) { if (numbers.length == 0) { return 0; } return 5; }
Baby steps in TDD could lead you to this implementation. It has 100% code coverage and all tests are green. But the implementation isn't finished at all. Our experiment where we investigated how much tests communicate the intent of the code showed flaws in metrics like code coverage.
Debugging is not needed
One promise of TDD or tests in general is that you can neglect debugging. Even abandon it. In my experience when a test goes red (especially an integration test) you sometimes need to fire up the debugger. The debugger helps you to step through code and see the actual state of the system at that time. Tests treat code as a black box, an input results in an output. But what happens in between? How much do you want to couple your tests to your actual implementation steps? Do we need the tests to cover this aspect of software development? Maybe something along the lines as shown in Inventing on principle where the computer shows you the immediate steps your code takes could replace debugging but tests alone cannot do it.
Design for testability
A noble goal. But are tests your primary client? No. Other code is. Design for maintainability would be better. You will need to change your code, fix it, introduce new features, etc. Don't get me wrong: You need tests and you need testability. But how much code do you write specifically for your tests? How much flexibility do you introduce because of your tests? What patterns do you use just because your tests need them? It's like YAGNI for code exposure for tests. Code specifically written only for tests couples your code to your tests. Only things that need to be coupled should be. Is the choice of the underlying data structure important? Couple it, test it. If it isn't, don't expose it, don't write a getter. Don't break the information hiding principle if you don't need to. If you couple your tests too much to your code every little change breaks your tests. This hinders maintenance. The important and difficult design question is: what is important. Test this.
You are faster than without tests
Some TDD practitioners claim that they are faster with TDD than without tests because the bugs and problems in your code will overwhelm you after a certain time. So with a certain level of complexity you are going faster with TDD. But where is this level? In my experience writing code without tests is 3x-4x faster than with TDD. For small applications. There are entire communities where many applications are written without or with only a few tests. But I wouldn't write a large application without tests but at least my feeling is that in many cases I go much slower. Cases where I feel faster are specification heavy. Like parsing or writing formats, designing an algorithm or implementing a scientific formula. So the call is open on this one. What are your experiences? Do you feel slowed down by TDD?
Flooding affecting south-west England and along the Thames Valley should provide a “sharp reminder” even to climate change sceptics of the risk of flooding, a former Conservative environment secretary has warned.
Caroline Spelman told the Guardian that today's climate was a consequence of what had happened twenty years ago – and that the UK must adapt to the changes that they said were still to come.
“This flooding is a sharp reminder that everyone, sceptic or not, has to think about the risk of flooding, whatever they think causes it,” they said. “We need to adapt. What is happening now relates to what we were doing two decades ago [in increasing greenhouse gas emissions].”
The debate over tackling climate change had become “muddied”, the former minister added, and criticised politicians for using the term “global warming” because it confuses people into thinking that climate change will result in warmer weather, rather than an increase in extreme weather such as higher rainfall.
Spelman, who was environment secretary between 2010 and 2012, also defended the embattled Environment Agency for its work in flood protection.
The agency has come under fire from some Conservatives and farmers for allegedly failing to protect flood-prone areas, including the Somerset levels where severe flooding has caused devastation.
Spelman, who was replaced by Owen Paterson in September 2012, experienced several incidents of severe flooding during their tenure.
They told the Guardian: “One of the things that is good about the Environment Agency is that it has empowered operatives on the ground to make decisions based on local circumstances, rather than waiting for someone on high to tell them what to do. They are an emergency service.”
They also praised the Met Office, which they said was “best in the world” when it comes to weather and flood forecasting. “I gave the Met Office extra money for supercomputing, which has allowed forecasting models to operate with pinpoint accuracy. Within hours [before it occurred] they could tell where a cloudburst would happen. That definitely has saved lives.”
They said that when they visited flooded areas as environment secretary “householders had nothing but praise for the Environment Agency”. They added: “I think the Environment Agency did a very good job in my time.”
They also defended spending on flood protection, saying that the previous Labour government had planned a 50% cut in capital spending that would have hurt defences, but that in office they had reversed this decision and received the support of the Treasury in doing so. “The return on investment on flood defence spending is very high – £8 for every £1 spent. That is why people and property get protected over farmland –the economics dictate that.”
But they said people and authorities in rural areas could form partnerships with business to gain access to higher levels of funding.
Spelman, a self-confessed “Green Conservative”, denied that green Toryism was under threat. “It's all in the name: Conservatives. We are about conservation,” they said.
Some politicians, including the former environment secretary Lord Deben, have warned that green issues are slipping down the party's agenda. Two Tories with a strong interest in the environment – Tim Yeo, chair of the energy and climate change select committee, and Anne McIntosh, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee – have been deselected by their local parties, amid speculation that one factor was that their green concerns were not popular among their constituency organisations.
Spelman, who is MP for Meriden in the West Midlands, said the chancellor George Osborne had shown their support for the environmental agenda by founding the Green Investment Bank with £3bn of public money.
Later this month, Spelman will join a group of legislators from around the world in calling for governments to enact national laws on tackling climate change. The meeting on 27 February in New York has been called by Globe, a body that brings together backbenchers from parliaments across developed and developing countries to campaign on climate change.
The Wii U version of Terraria recently received It's very last update, which is the final one due to “technical limitations” related to what the hardware is capable of. The patch introduces a new NPC called the Stylist, new mechanics, new items and changes to art and balance. Check out developer 505 Games‘ explanation for why it is the last update on Wii U:
This update is intended to draw a line under Terraria on Wii U as it did with the other platforms – so we are afraid that no further updates for Wii U will be possible due to technical limitations. Bear in mind that you now have the same great content in two hits. There were more updates on the other platforms simply because they were released earlier. The content is the same. The logic for being unable to further update Wii U is, regrettably, the same as the ‘old gen' machines – though the Wii U does admittedly have more resources than the 360/PS3, it is still a fraction as capable as PS4 and Xbox One, and we need all their available horsepower to take Terraria where we want to go next. This version will still be able to play online, so you can continue to enjoy it as long as you're gaming on the Wii U platform. By the time the next update rolls out on PS4/Xbox One we'll be very close to the launch of NX… But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Oh, it's about time. Felt sorry for our nation's kids for too long with the former FLOTUS's vomit-inducing lunch plan. Since we now have a new administration, the program could be rolled back. A document released by the office of Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., called for repealing certain aspects of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. This initiative was released as part of Meadows's larger plan called, “First 100 Days: Rules, Regulations, and Executive Orders to Examine, Revoke and Issue.”
In the plan, it calls for the Trump administration to reverwe around 200 rules and regulations, including Michelle's crappy lunch plan. A related report from the House Freedom Caucus reads:
The regulations have proven to be burdensome and unworkable for schools to implement. Schools are throwing food away that students are not eating.
Since 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture required that school lunches include either a fruit or vegetable in government-subsidized school lunches. Although, this 2015 University of Vermont report found that even when students added more fruits and vegetables to their plates, “children consumed fewer [fruits and vegetables] and wasted more during the school year immediately following implementation of the USDA rule.”
The report was titled, “Impact of the National School Lunch Program on Fruit and Vegetable Selection.” In addition, it found that the average waste increased from a quarter cup to more than one-third of a cup per tray. Researchers made over 20 visits to two northeaster elementary schools where they took photos of students' trays after they selected their items. Hey, I'd throw these items away too. Yuck.
Add to that the widespread complaints, from school officials and parents, that the school program encourages food waste. Plus, since it has restrictions on sugar, sodium, calories and fat–around 1.2 million students stopped eating school lunches. Then, there are the school systems who dropped out because the cost of compliance was much more than the amount of subsidies received.
1 Miami Heat As we approach the season's midpoint, it is becoming more and more likely that Miami will in fact be a 60-win team. It is hard to imagine them not slowing down at some point, particularly if there is an injury, but it won't happen anytime soon.
2 San Antonio Spurs The calls have been a little too close for the Spurs to feel comfortable, but they remain the undisputed best team in the Western Conference. A stiff challenge lies ahead with the Mavericks coming to town on Friday. A must-watch showdown on national television.
3 Boston Celtics After losing to Houston, Doc Rivers stressed the importance of establishing home court advantage in the East. Seeing that the Celtics will not be resting up for the playoffs will make for a thrilling Miami-Boston chase in the second half of the season.
4 Orlando Magic The added firepower has made a difference in Orlando, and it has been working out in the Magic's favor. They have been averaging 107.6 points per game on their current win streak, and it has come from several difference contributors.
5 Los Angeles Lakers Nothing quite like a home game against the Cavaliers to shake the cobwebs out. The Lakers had seven players in double figures as they dismantled the lowly Cavs 112-57 with an all-business efficiency.
6 Dallas Mavericks The Mavericks have gotten used to the idea of Caron Butler being gone for the season, but they have been desperately missing Dirk. Dallas has lost five of their last seven, with the only positive being Deshawn Stevenson's rejuvenation as a consistent deep-ball threat.
7 Chicago Bulls A couple of bad road losses to Philadelphia and New Jersey should be no reason to panic, but the Bulls clearly have not reached that point of Eastern Conference dominance just yet.
8 Atlanta Hawks The Hawks have won 9 of 12 since Joe Johnson returned from elbow surgery, and if that elbow stays healthy the Hawks should keep their standard pace of hanging around near the top of the Eastern Conference. They just have so many ways to hurt you, as Indiana found out on Saturday.
9 Oklahoma City Thunder Not an easy stretch ahead for a Thunder squad that has been struggling a bit on defense. They will face the Magic at home on Thursday then travel to the coast to face the Lakers in the Staples Center. It should be a revealing couple of days for an OKC team that is making a case for legitimate threat in the Western Conference.
10 Utah Jazz The Jazz have stumbled and slipped into a point of mediocrity that will not promise any kind of postseason success. If the Jazz want to become relevant, they need to get back to the aggressiveness that got them the 15-5 start.
11 New York Knicks The Knicks seem to have gotten it back on track, handily taking care of Phoenix and Portland, but the biggest news is New York's renwed involvement in the Carmelo Anthony discussion. Would adding Melo make this team an immediate title contender? Or would the pieces they would have to give up change the dynamic that has worked to get them to this point?
12 New Orleans Hornets The Hornets supporting cast has not done a very good job keeping up with a Paul's resurgence, but they have ben able to create enough offense to make them relevant again. New Orleans won't stun anyone, but making it back to the playoffs is the first step for Monty Williams.
13 Denver Nuggets All season the Nuggets have been a temporary bunch, constantly awaiting a Melo mega-deal. With the trade deadline a little over a month away, the blockbuster deal seems inevitable. Where this team can end up is entirely dependent on how the deal works out for Denver.
14 Portland Trailblazers Portland finally gets a scheduling break, with a pretty easy 10 days coming up. Nothing will cure offensive ails quite like New Jersey, Minnesota, and a pair of meetings with Sacramento.
15 Milwaukee Bucks The Bucks are finally starting to get it back together, and just in time. When Brandon Jennings gets back 100%, Milwaukee will still be in a position to make a run for the Eastern Conference playoffs.
16 Memphis Grizzlies The Grizzlies are showing their best face to the best opponents in the league, but if they can't turn these strong performances into wins they will find themselves once again on the short end of the stick in the West. The performance against OKC was good, but not good enough.
17 Houston Rockets The Rockets can't seem to stay above .500 so far this season. Every time they get there they collapse once again. A team that focuses far too much on the offensive production of one (Martin), they welcome Aaron Brooks back to the court.
18 Indiana Pacers Still getting used to running an offense through Darren Collison and Roy Hibbert, the Pacers are doing a good job of beating the beatable opponents, but aren't pulling off enough upsets to make any waves in the East.
19 Golden State Warriors It was recently pointed out that after playing more road games than any team in the NBA, the Warriors will have 15 of their next 17 games at home. Time get Oracle Arena rocking and time for the Warriors to make a run in the standings.
20 Charlotte Bobcats The Paul Silas era has led to breakouts for D.J. Augustine and Gerald Henderson. One would think this could lead to a playoff repeat for Charlotte, but things will get tougher if New Jersey gets significantly stronger after the Denver deal.
21 Phoenix Suns It's time the Phoenix Suns blow it up. The trade has left Phoenix barren and playing with very little emotion. Steve Nash won't accomplish much playing for a postseason-less team, so you might as well ship them to a contender to prepare for the future.
22 Toronto Raptors Teams that live by the three ball die by the three ball. As long as perimeter shooting is such an important part of Toronto's success it will hurt them when teams decide to tighten perimeter defense. Which is basically when the game matters.
23 Philadelphia 76ers After Friday's upset of the Bulls, the Sixers were unable to keep the momentum going with close losses to Detroit and Indiana. They have Iguodala back from nursing an injured achilles, but they hardly look effective yet.
24 Los Angeles Clippers The Clippers have started getting consistent production out of the Davis/Gordon backcourt, perhaps a sign that having Baron in Los Angeles is the right move for the young Clips squad. I know Griffin's highlight reel has benefited.
25 Detroit Pistons If Detroit adds Johan Petro, it's not changing the culture in Detroit. But I understand their will to free up cap room by getting involved in the Melo deal. It is time to start over in the Motor City.
26 New Jersey Nets The rest of their season is dependent on what happens in the coming weeks. Could make or break Avery Johnson's tenure in New Jersey.
27 Washington Wizards I will not write more than a sentence about the Wizards until they win a road game; because they do not deserve effort from me until I see it from them.
28 Sacramento Kings Tyreke Evans being relegated back tot they bench usually is good news for the Kings upcoming opponents. They have dropped two in a row (and their last three) when Tyreke sits out.
29 Minnesota Timberwolves Did you know the Timberwolves lead the NBA in rebounds per game? How about that!
It's a rare feat, but Charlottetown Liberal MP Sean Casey was able to pass a motion before the Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs. Conservatives were late for the meeting and lost the vote.
It calls for the committee to suspend work on a commemoration study and focus instead on the looming $200 millions in cuts to the Department of Veteran Affairs and the impact on veterans and staff.
"The Conservatives unilaterally set the agenda, putting my motion at the end of the agenda. As soon as the meeting started I was able to get the chairperson's attention and presented my motion there and then," Casey told CBC News Thursday.
"Three conservatives were late for the meeting, although we did have a quorum and as a result of a vote among those present, it passed. They weren't very happy."
Casey said they feel bad that some of the witnesses scheduled to speak before the committee Thursday had to go back home because of their motion.
But they said it's vital the cuts be discussed as soon as possible.
Casey said despite Thursday's victory, he's worried the Conservatives on the committee will find some other way to quash their motion or restrict the witness list.
Stephen Curry introduced the world to their fourth signature shoe, the Curry 4, on June 1, during Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Over the next five games, Curry averaged just over 26 points and 8 assists per game to complete Golden State's second NBA championship run in three years.
Fast-forward to October 7, when Curry and Under Armour will give others a taste of what the two-time World Champion and two-time league MVP was looking for in their new shoe: more traction, more comfort and more control.
Over eight seasons in the league, Curry's ball handling skills have only become more magical – hence the colorway name. He's been described as the league's most creative, mesmerizing, illusive, and thrilling player to watch, while their ability to deceive and elude defenders continues to be the best show on hardwood.
The Curry 4 “More Magic” is available primarily in China. The colors flowing across the toe box and wrapping around the shoe pull inspiration from the vibrancy of The Bund where the neon lights of the modern city reflect off the waters of the Huangpu River snaking through Shanghai.
Looking ahead to the 2017-18 NBA season, Curry has shared they are hungry for more: more wins, more reps, more records, more titles – and more magic for their team and the fans.
The first Curry 4 colorway to release, “More Magic,” will be available in limited pairs across China while supplies last beginning October 7. Later that day in the US, a few pairs will drop at Shoe Palace (4900 Telegraph Ave, Oakland, Calif.) and Footlocker (Sunvalley Mall, Concord, Calif.) in the Bay Area, and at the Under Armour Brand Houses in Boston and Chicago for $130 USD.
Story highlights Big rats are reportedly running rampant in 26 districts in Tehran
The government uses poison, and teams of sharpshooters are killing the rodents with air guns
The biggest headache is Norwegian rats, which can grow to 16 inches
The rats die hard in Iran.
Iran has the biggest beef with Norwegian rats, Mohammad Hadi Heydarzadeh, a top environmental official, told CNN.
They said the critters have "entered Iran from abroad by cargo ships."
Though it's unclear if the rats come with paperwork, a search of ratbehavior.org shows that that particular kind of rat can grow 16 inches long. And they are very aggressive, "fighting, chasing, biting and boxing."
While the Iranians have used poison to kill the rats during the daytime, at night the teams of sharpshooters use infrared lenses to hunt them down.
"We have identified the rats' places of congregation by using (computer) software," Heydarzadeh explained.
By the end of 2013, the Iranians hope to have 40 teams of shooters working, they added.
So far, 2,205 rats have been killed. Their bodies are carted off and incinerated or buried in special dumps, the environmental official explained.
University researchers are working with the government to assess whether their newest plan of attack is working.
But Heydarzadeh feels good.
"The number of these rodents in Tehran," they said, "is on the decline."
At least one quarter of meat on sale in the UK comes from farms that do not have to meet national standards for animal welfare, a Guardian investigation has found.
The poor conditions in which the animals can be kept include greater crowding in chicken and turkey sheds, cage-like pens for female pigs and physical castration with no anaesthetic for boars.
The UK has relatively high standards of animal welfare compared with the rest of the world, including the European Union. However, there are no restrictions on importing meat from countries that do not impose such standards, where costs are often lower. There are renewed calls from consumer and farming groups for better labelling of products and action to bring standards into line, at least across the EU.
"Sometimes people may be making false assumptions about products, sometimes they may have genuinely lower standards – I don't think people know what the situation is," said Sue Davies, chief policy adviser for the consumer lobby group Which?.
Kevin Pearce, head of food and farming at the National Farmers Union (NFU), said some overseas farmers would be required by retailers to meet higher standards than their national minimums. However, there is particular concern over the quality of imported food used in restaurants, pubs, canteens and other catering outlets, which now accounts for half of the money spent on food in the UK, said Pearce.
"If consumers know anything about it, they probably think all the standards are the same," they said. "It's not about farmers whingeing, we want to be able to compete fairly. If the customers say 'that's the standard we want', we want to do our best to produce it. Where we have a problem is if the price is too high or the supply too short they'll go elsewhere to get it."
Public concern about the costs of modern food has been growing after a number of health scares, high-profile books and, last week, the UK premiere of the Oscar-nominated documentary Food Inc, which claims to expose the "highly mechanised underbelly" of the industry.
The NFU has previously complained that the differences in standards are unfair to UK farmers, for example claiming that half of the pork market went overseas when sow pens and tethering were banned.
However the scale of the problem has been revealed by a Guardian analysis of the most recent full-trade figures available, for 2007. It found that:
• More than half of bacon sold in the UK comes from the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and Italy, where farmers can keep sows in smaller pens and for longer periods.
• 43% of other pork products come from Denmark, Germany the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, where the same poorer conditions on pig farms are allowed.
• One quarter of poultry sold in the UK comes from seven European countries and Brazil, which allow higher stocking of chickens and do not force farmers to use more comfortable dry bedding.
• 3% of beef is imported from Brazil, where practices including hot branding, castration and dehorning of cattle can be carried out without anaesthetic. Products from those major importers accounted for about one quarter of all meat sold, by weight, in the UK that year. Total imports of pork, poultry, beef and veal made up one third of all meat sales, and it is likely that some of the remaining imports came from smaller trading countries also with lower standards.
Concerns have also been raised about imports of lamb and mutton from Australia, where mulesing – cutting away the woolly skin around the buttocks to prevent pests breeding – is common.
The Soil Association, the trade body for organic farmers, has raised concerns that imported organic pig and poultry meat often comes from countries with lower organic standards than those it sets in the UK. The NFU said it wanted both better labelling and education about the standards for imported meat on sale, and fairer trade rules to create a level playing field between UK and overseas farmers. Davies said Which? was already part of a lobby pressing the EU to make retailers label food more clearly with the country of origin. Most food does not have to be labelled, and often labels only show the country where the food was last processed.
"There are three issues: being clear about the relative quality of our standards and whether it's beneficial to be buying British, or not; whether we should have a simpler system across the EU, even should they have the same standards; and there's a lot of consumer demand to have information about the country of origin," said Davies.
UK meat key concerns
Poultry: Most UK farmers are limited to a maximum of 38kg per square metre of space – 15 birds at their fattest – compared with one third more than that in the EU. UK standards for access to drink and feed, and healthy bedding are also higher, said the NFU.
Pigs: Farrowing crates are used in the UK for a few weeks after piglets are born, something which hugely reduces young mortality; most countries use significantly smaller sow pens and the animals are kept in them most of the year.
Beef: The chief concern is imported meat from Brazil, where cattle can be castrated up to six months old, dehorned and hot-branded, all without anaesthetic – all of which are banned in the UK.
Organic: The biggest UK organic body specifies that pigs are fully free range and poultry flocks no bigger than 500 birds to increase access outdoors and reduce bullying. Many other certifiers allow pigs to be often kept indoors and unlimited chicken flocks.
Even though Guillermo del Toro won't be directing the sequel to Pacific Rim, the 2013 action-adventure film that pitted humans in enormous robots against equally enormous inter-dimensional monsters, the 51-year-old horror maestro will serve as a producer, so he's still keeping tabs on what's going on.
Aside from Steven S. DeKnight now being in the director's chair, screenwriters Emily Carmichael and Kira Snyder penning the most recent script, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens star John Boyega playing the son of the late Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), we don't know all that much about Pacific Rim 2.
Although is reported that Charlie Hunnam or Rinko Kikuchi were expected to be back for the sequel, we still haven't heard a confirmation on their return. So, will they be back? "As a producer I learned not to declare anything about a movie I'm not directing. I can tell you this — a lot of the cast from the first movie is coming back," del Toro told The Hollywood Reporter. "I leave those communications to Steven DeKnight. He's not only a director, but he's actually a guy I respect and admire and it's their movie."
What does del Toro think of the addition of Boyega? "I admire them tremendously. The idea for me is that this is a continuation of the great leadership character that was Idris Elba," they said. "It's a very different character but I love the idea of having a main character who is not a white Anglo-Saxon guy. Before the heated conversation about diversity in film started we were doing Pacific Rim. And I think that universe is a huge proponent of that."
Sheffield United are saddened to hear of the passing of another former player, Len Allchurch.
Signed by John Harris from Swansea for a reported fee of £12,500, it proved to be an inspired capture.
Len, who made 146 appearances scoring 37 goals for the Blades, helped invigorate a flagging promotion push and scored on their debut, adding a further five in the final seven games that saw United promoted back to Division One.
They also gained four Welsh international caps as a Blade to add to the seven gained whilst at Swansea.
They played their final game for the Blades in 1965 on the BOAC tour of Australia and New Zealand before joining Stockport County where they went on to win a Fourth Division Championship medal.
They were the brother of fellow footballer and Welsh legend Ivor Allchurch
The Allchurch family are in the thoughts of all at Sheffield United FC at this sad time.

PARIS - An outspoken pro-Israel politician caused outrage across France on Wednesday by comparing the mutilated corpse of a Palestinian child to "halal meat".
Jacques Renaud, the right wing deputy mayor affiliated to the UMP opposition, portrayed infants being killed in the Gaza Strip to animals slaughtered according to Islamic ritual.
The 66-year-old's comments came as thousands prepared to take to the streets of Paris in a pro-Palestine demonstration which many fear will explode into violence.
Jewish groups have accused anti-Semites of hijacking the rallies, while thousands of Muslims taking part say they are being unfairly characterised as extremists.
They are particularly angry at the vitriol displayed by elected politicians like Mr Renaud, who is based in Montreuil-Juigne, just north of Angers.
Mr Renaud, who is also a successful business person, wrote on Twitter: "Great support to all the attacked Jews of France, we are in the 21st Century, a bit of humanity and civility would be welcome."
A critic responded by tweeting a picture of a decapitated child, referring to the barbarity of the Israeli army which has killed more than 200 children during its assault on Gaza.
In response to the horrifying image Mr Renaud replied: ‘It's halal meat, I suppose.'
Halal is Arabic for permissible, and refers to food which adheres to Islamic law, as defined in the Koran.
It is a big issue in France, where the five million plus strong Muslim community regularly complains about government attempts to outlaw it.
Mr Renaud is a firm supporter of Israel who regularly takes to Twitter to attack Hamas, the ruling authority in Gaza.
Stephane Piednoir, the UMP mayor of Montreuil-Juigne was on holiday so not able to respond to their assistant's words, but a spokesperson said there would be ‘grave consequences' if the comments turned out to be true. Mr Renaud was not available for comment.
A banned pro-Palestine march ended in violence on Saturday, and on Sunday a synagogue in a northern suburb of Paris was threatened by a mob of rioters.
Despite the street violence, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said tonight's protest could go ahead, with security stepped up across the capital.
Mr Cazeneuve said, "I have given specific orders to security forces so they can quickly intervene if any anti-Semitic acts are committed."
Anti-Semitic chants are banned under French criminal law and – to date – there has been no evidence of any being used on the marchers.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - There have been 44 U.S. presidents. There have been over 300 Americans in space. But there are only 32 teams in the National Football League.
In 1993, a sleepy city in Northeast Florida was awarded one of those coveted NFL franchises.
“Membership has selected Jacksonville as the next NFL club,” then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced.
The decision stunned the sports world.
The year Jacksonville was awarded an NFL expansion team was a defining moment in the city's history. But getting to that point took a lot of time, a lot of energy and often was a bruising battle.
“It was completely unpleasant -- cursing and yelling back and forth,” said former Mayor John Delaney. “I've been negotiating my entire life as a prosecutor, and you're dealing with criminal defense lawyers who are dealing with people's lives, and I've never had anything like this.”
“I think we have to be transparent and say there were some feelings of doubt,” former Jaguars owner Delores Weaver said.
The journey was a 15-year odyssey of unfulfilled hope and hard knocks that turned Jacksonville's “fourth-and-long” into a game-changer.
“This is a Cinderella story. There's no question of that,” Delaney said.

In the 1970s and '80s, Jacksonville was known mostly for its smell coming from the paper mill and the tolls the city had on Interstate 95.
“Tearing that down -- that was a great day: Aug. 12, 1989, the day the tolls came down,” former Mayor Tommy Hazouri said.
The city was also known as a big football town that successfully supported the annual Florida-Georgia game and was interested in a professional franchise.
IMAGES: How Jacksonville got the Jaguars
“We had a few teams that were flirting with leaving their towns, and we became a leverage point. If the cities the teams were in didn't give a better deal, they could come to Jacksonville,” Delaney said. “So we were a bridesmaid for a couple of times.”
Then in 1991, the National Football League decided to add two teams to the 28 that already existed, and Jacksonville was in the running, along with Baltimore, Carolina, Memphis and St. Louis.
At the time, Jacksonville had a population just under 1 million, and Memphis had a population just over 1 million. Charlotte's population was 1.1 million, St. Louis' was 2.5 million and Baltimore's was 6.7 million.
A group called Touchdown Jacksonville led the charge to bring an NFL team to the city. Among its members were Jacksonville business people Tom Petway and Ron Weaver, who got their brother, successful business person Wayne Weaver, involved.
RELATED: Winning the Jaguars: Weavers join the team
Disagreements between the city and Touchdown Jacksonville over plans for a rebuilt stadium at one point caused Wayne Weaver to pull the plug on the whole venture.
“I don't know if I was mad. I was disappointed,” said Wayne Weaver, who sold the team in January 2012 to current owner Shad Khan.
RELATED: Winning the Jaguars: NFL hopes survive City Council fight
“He was mad,” Delores Weaver interjected.
“I had a tear or two,” Wayne Weaver admitted, “because we had all gotten so close and worked so hard on this. We had a great partnership group, people that loved and believed in Jacksonville, so it was a disappointing decision they made.”
But eventually the deal got back on track and despite a hurricane barreling toward Jacksonville that nearly thwarted all their hard work, the NFL dream came true when Tagliabue made that fateful announcement.

Rajon Rondo is not your average point guard. This much is a given. In fact, that might be the only definitive thing I can say about them at this point.
He's a great passer but they sometimes look to pass to a fault. They can be an elite defender but they gamble too much. He's a poor shooter but he'll still take a shot from time to time. He's incredibly bright by all accounts, but also terribly stubborn. They have a stoic face but you can see the fire in him. He's utterly fearless and plays through pain, yet they sometimes slack off and may have to thin of a skin for their own good.
To me, these are the reasons why Rondo is becoming the most polarizing player for fans. He's either totally mesmerizing or completely infuriating, sometimes in the same game.
If, like me, you focus on the positives, you'll see a 2 time All Star pass-first point guard with triple double potential who has proven that they can take their game to the highest levels when it matters most. On the other hand, if you choose to focus on the negative, you'll see an inconsistent, moody, potentially fatally flawed enigma of a player that may not be worth building around. Neither opinion is wrong or right, they are opinions.
Here's the thing that keeps me coming back for more and makes me want to sign up for at least a few more years of Rondo after this year. He's never been in a situation at the pro level tailor made to accentuate their talents. Sure, as a pass first guy he's blessed with 3 Hall of Famers to pass to, but they do almost all their work in the half court. As you may have heard, Rondo's lack of jumper creates a sagging defense that dares them to shoot at the expense of other guys getting open.
Rondo needs to run but they don't have the horses to gallop with. He's a young black stallion that has grown up hitched to a team of clydesdales. They get the job done, but you get the feeling that if they were ever unbridled he'd be something incredible to behold.
I'm not saying that we need to blow this thing up now. But when the season is over, I'd like Danny to think long and hard about bringing in some runners and gunners (who are willing to play a little defense as well). Imagine an athletic big man pulling down a board, outlletting to Rondo, who pushes the ball down the defenses throat and leaves the ball off for one of two streaking wing players who finish with a flush. Or perhaps the next time down they draw the defenders to themselves but kicks it out beyond the arc for an open look at the 3. This happens in dribs and drabs with this group (see the back to back alley-oops to JJJ and Wilcox), but not often enough to utilize Rondo's talent.
He'll need to be surrounded by shooters that can get open without having the ball in their hands (a reason to keep Ray Allen around for as long as is fiscally possible). He'll also need some bigs to bang and board down low. Imagine a Varejao type roaming the paint, gobbling up missed Rondo jumpers and putting them back for scores. It would be like a modified assist.
It wouldn't be easy, but it could certainly be done. Danny would have to stop dangling Rondo in trades and start making a concerted effort to build around the guy. That might mean taking a pass on the "best player available" in free agency or the draft if that guy was a bad fit.
Of course you could determine that it isn't worth building a whole team around one enigmatic player. Maybe it would be easier with a "normal" point guard and a more traditional offense. But what would be the fun in that? Personally I'm all in on Rondo. I want to see them retire a Celtic if possible. On the other hand, I get it if you have reservations and wouldn't mind "selling high" on them right now. He's just a different kind of guy and he's not for everyone.
Still, I would argue that their uniqueness is what makes them so special. You don't get rid of a Monet because it doesn't match your furniture. You buy new furniture and look to add more Monets to compliment it. At least that's what I'd do if I were a filthy rich art collector. Danny's going to have a lot of money to spend this summer. Here's hoping that they spend it like a filthy rich art collector.
Image copyright CHRISTIE'S Image caption The ring, belonging to the Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan, was inscribed with the name of Ram, a Hindu God
A ring belonging to an 18th Century Indian ruler has been sold at an auction in London amid criticism from heritage groups.
The jewelled golden ring was sold for £145,000 by Christie's auction house.
It belonged to Tipu Sultan, a Muslim king, and is notable because it was inscribed with the name of a Hindu God.
Tipu Sultan is best known for fighting against British rule in India. The ring is thought to have been taken from them by a British general as they lay dead.
The 41.2g ring was sold to an undisclosed bidder for almost 10 times its estimated price at the auction in central London, according to Christie's website.
It is inscribed with the name of the Hindu God Ram in raised Devanagri script. Some say this shows that the king was more sympathetic to Hindus than previously thought.
The ring was allegedly taken from the slain body of Tipu Sultan at the end of the 1799 Srirangappattinam battle they fought against the British East India Company's forces.
The auction listing noted that "it is surprising that a ring bearing the name of a Hindu god would have been worn by the great Muslim warrior".
Image copyright PA Image caption Another jewel belonging to Tipu Sultan sold for almost £400,000 in 2009
"It is perhaps more likely that the ring was taken from Tipu Sultan's collection," the listing said.
Tipu Sultan was considered a progressive ruler, says Manivannan Thirumalai from the BBC's Tamil section.
Also known as the Tiger of Mysore, they ruled the state for 17 years after they succeeded their father, Hyder Ali.
Outcry
Earlier this month Professor S. Settar from India's National Institute of Advanced Studies warned that the ring might be hidden from public view if it was sold to a private bidder.
They urged the Indian government to "make use of all available avenues, legal and diplomatic, to recover the ring".
If the ring could not be stopped from going to auction, they said, Indian philanthropists should be encouraged to purchase it on behalf of the nation. It is not known if the new owner of the ring is Indian.
Another group calling itself the Tipu Sultan United Front also urged Indian authorities to do all they could to prevent the ring from being sold.
The ring was previously listed for sale by Christie's in 2012 but was then withdrawn from sale.

As previously reported, Cary Fukunaga 's adaptation of Stephen King 's iconic horror novel ‘It' will begin shooting this summer , with Fukunaga filming the first in the planned two-part adaptation. In a new interview with Seth Grahame-Smith , the producer has confirmed that the film is moving rather swiftly into production, and tells us a little more about what we can expect from this highly-anticipated adaptation.
Stephen King's ‘It' is one of the most terrifying and iconic stories the author has ever produced—thanks in part to their excellent work in developing the main characters as children, which heightens the fear of their harrowing experience with the evil entity who often presents itself as Pennywise the Clown. That juvenile sense of fear is renewed as the friends become adults and are brought back together to face their fears—and Pennywise—once again.
Previously made into a memorable TV miniseries in the ‘90s, ‘It' remains a tricky story to adapt (like most King novels), but in a new interview with EW , producer Seth Grahame-Smith assures us that the film is going to be quite scary and vicious—as it should be:
I think that if anything, [the new film] will bring back some of the viciousness of the book that they couldn't do with the miniseries because it was for broadcast. I think it's going to be very scary, but I also feel like you've got Cary who is going to direct these kids—and he's incredible at casting, incredible at shooting. He's incredible with tone and atmosphere.
Grahame-Smith is certainly correct about Fukunaga, who directed the entire first season of ‘ True Detective ,' and also delivered the most talked-about television scene of 2014. Fukunaga's grasp of atmosphere is incredible, and it's the biggest takeaway from their adaptation of ‘Jane Eyre,' which nails a romantic but subtle and often disquieting gothic vibe.
The TV version of ‘It' was fine, although it's recalled more fondly now as a bit of horror nostalgia. To adapt ‘It' properly, you really have to be able to explore some of the more terrifying and strange elements. The film version will also likely succeed largely on the way the younger cast members are presented, and Fukunaga will definitely need an excellent young cast. King takes a very honest look at coming of age in ‘It,' but it's not often that we see kids portrayed in such a candid light these days.
Grahame-Smith went on to confirm that Fukunaga plans to shoot the first of the two films this summer, which would focus largely on the characters as children:
We're going to get a draft, what is supposed to be the shooting [script], any day now from Cary and their writing partner. We're doing a deal for them to write the second movie. Our hope is to prep sometime in the next few months and shoot in the summer. That one is as much on the runway as we can possibly be. I know New Line is ready to go.
With that in mind, we could likely see the first ‘It' film in 2017.
The Wildrose Party says it's a troubling sign that the NDP energy minister's top staffer was registered as a federal lobbyist for an organization opposed to pipeline projects proposed to ship Alberta oilsands crude.
But Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said Thursday that their new chief of staff, Graham Mitchell, hadn't worked against pipelines and noted they are “the one in charge” of the ministry in any case.
According to the federal Commissioner of Lobbying's website, Mitchell was registered on Jan. 29 as the responsible officer for the Leadnow Society, which describes itself as an “independent advocacy organization that runs campaigns on the major issues of our time.”
The numerous lobbying activities listed for the organization include asking federal Conservative MPs from British Columbia to pressure cabinet to stop Enbridge's Northern Gateway Pipeline, and requesting the National Energy Board open its Energy East pipeline hearings to the public and take climate change science into account.
However, the registry shows no actual lobbying of federal officials took place by the organization since Mitchell was registered.
Wildrose energy critic Leela Aheer said Mitchell's hiring sends the wrong message to the province's energy industry.
“This seems very, very uncomfortable. We just don't understand why they made this decision,” Aheer told reporters at the legislature.
The Chestermere-Rocky View MLA said the oilpatch is already concerned about the NDP's campaign promise of a royalty review and tougher climate change rules.
NDP Premier Rachel Notley, whose party ended four decades of Progressive Conservative power in the May 5 election, has said their government would not continue Alberta's advocacy of Northern Gateway, which has attracted fierce opposition from B.C. First Nations and environmental groups.
However, Notley has said they are tentatively in favour of TransCanada Corp.'s Energy East project, which is aimed at shipping Alberta bitumen to refineries in New Brunswick.
Mitchell, who served as an assistant to former federal NDP Leader Jack Layton when Layton was a Toronto city councillor, took a leave from the Broadbent Institute left-wing think-tank to temporarily serve as Leadnow's executive director.
McCuaig-Boyd told reporters that as executive director of the non-governmental organization between January and April, Mitchell was required to register as a lobbyist — but they never did any lobbying. They said Mitchell's work with Leadnow was administrative.
“He totally supports the position we have here in Alberta in our energy program,” the energy minister said.
McCuaig-Boyd called Mitchell very capable, but noted they do not set policy.
“I am the minister and they take direction from me, as do all my staff,” they said. “I am the one in charge.”
TransCanada declined to comment, while Enbridge did not respond to a request for comment.
But Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said their focus is on the elected officials, not who they appoint as staff.
They noted their organization had a good discussion with McCuaig-Boyd earlier this week.
“The government has, I think, made it fairly clear that they think a strong Alberta has a strong energy sector as an important part of it. So those are the things we certainly are keying on,” said McMillan, themselves a former Saskatchewan cabinet minister.
But David MacLean, vice-president of the Alberta Enterprise Group, said Mitchell's prominent position within the energy ministry undermines Notley's positive language about working with business and the oil and gas industry.
MacLean said Mitchell should be moved to a different position within government.
“We have no choice but to ask, is the government dealing in good faith with the energy sector and with all the industries that rely on its success?” they asked.

If you found yourself walking around the Södermalm district of Stockholm, you may see the popular Vita Bergen Park. You may also glimpse the spire of the nearby Sofia Church.
What you would not see is the vast bunker, now data center, that hums quietly 100 feet below the ground.
Originally constructed in 1943 as a nuclear shelter, the Pionen Bunker was built to last: blasted from granite, with 16-inch thick metal doors, it was one of Sweden's many defensive bunkers. As the authors of the upcoming book Global Undergrounds: Exploring Cities Within explain, by the mid-1960s, Sweden was filled with such invisible spaces. The country had around 43,000 shelters, built to hold three million people—“almost half of the country's population.”
In 2007, after many of these facilities had been decommissioned, Pionen had a second life. The CEO of one of Sweden's largest internet service provider decided it was the perfect place for a data center, and demolished a further 141,000 cubic feet of space. Their architects then designed a bold, futuristic interior. Somewhat fittingly, it temporarily hosted Julian Assange's WikiLeaks server.

Around the world, there are spaces like Pionen that lie deep in the ground. Under the historic market town of Corsham, Wiltshire, is the 35-acre Burlington Bunker, a nuclear shelter built in the mid-1950s. Near Bogota, 660 feet into the earth is a former mine turned tourist destination. A short walk from the Place de la Bastille in Paris, there is the Arsenal Metro, a station that was closed the day before war was declared on Germany in 1939. And under Maastrict, there are defensive tunnels dating from Roman times.
These fascinating, often obscure subterranean spaces are explored in depth in Global Undergrounds. Rather than looking upwards and outwards as cities soar and sprawl, it examines the underground areas that difficult to access and rarely seen. Atlas Obscura has a glimpse of these worlds hidden deep beneath our feet.

Canadian troops will be dispatched to Manitoba as the flood threat from the Assiniboine River continues to grow, Prime Minister Stephen Harper says.
The military will work with local officials in the affected areas to assist those in need and evacuate those in harm's way, Harper said in a statement Sunday.
"I know Manitobans will show the resolve and courage they have demonstrated in the past when facing great adversity. Our thoughts and prayers are with the residents of Manitoba as they endure the devastating effects of these floods," the prime minister said.
Premier Greg Selinger, who had asked for help in a phone call with Harper on Sunday, said the federal government has agreed to send several hundred soldiers to provide support in places where access is difficult.
Selinger told a news conference Sunday night that dikes need to be raised or strengthened in an area along the Assiniboine River that stretches from Portage la Prairie to Headingley, just west of Winnipeg.
"Last weekend's storms and the additional rain forecast in the next two to four days will result in unprecedented flows of water on the Assiniboine River," they said.
"We want to ensure that those dikes are reinforced as much as possible. If anything breaches we'll have a crew of trained personnel — military personnel — that can move very quickly."
Selinger said the soldiers, most of whom are already in the province stationed at Canadian Forces Base Shilo or reservists, will have about three days to do their job. Forecasters said Winnipeg is not considered at risk.
State of emergency
Earlier in the day, Selinger toured the Brandon area — which is upstream from where the soldiers will be working — with Mayor Sheri Decter-Hirst after the city declared a state of emergency.
Decter-Hirst renewed a call for sandbagging volunteers. No property has been flooded to date in the Brandon area but the community is clearly on edge.
About 900 homes and businesses have been placed on evacuation alert in the city of 40,000, which means residents should be prepared to leave their homes on short notice.
City council met Sunday to issue the emergency declaration as river levels rose beyond earlier predicted levels and sandbag dikes were reinforced. The Assiniboine River reached the highest level in Brandon in recorded history last Thursday. Protective dikes were being raised another 36 centimetres Sunday as water levels at the First Street Bridge rose more than 13 centimetres in the past 24 hours.
The emergency declaration allows the city and province to work together on flood protection and response.
About 400 Brandon elementary school students will miss school Monday due to the state of emergency. Kirkaldy Heights School will close for two days because of its location near the river. On Wednesday classes will be relocated to Brandon University.
Crews finished raising dikes Saturday along 1st and 18th streets but several car dealerships have moved their inventory to higher ground.
Ron Ball, president of Precision Toyota, said they made the decision to move out since the river levels are so near the top of a nearby permanent dike.
Car dealers move inventory
Ball says two other nearby car dealers have also moved out inventory. "With the expected rains coming, they're not sure how much work they'll be able to do on the dikes so it's very close to the top of the dike now," they said. "We've got a lot of inventory so we moved it."
Heavy rains are forecast for Brandon and western Manitoba in the next few days. Decter-Hirst said the rain will have an effect on river levels and the amount of water going through storm drains.
"We'll just keep working as hard as we can, you know, against whatever odds are thrown against us," they said.
People learned Friday that more water than originally estimated would be heading down the Assiniboine River from Saskatchewan.
When Microsoft announced the availability of extensions for Edge, nearly ever user began asking when Adblock would arrive for the browser. While it was promised at launch that the extension would soon arrive, the product has now shown up in the Windows Store.
The extensions, which you can download here: Adblock or Adblock Plus, will allow you to block advertisements with your browser. Of course, you need to be running an Insider build that supports the feature in Edge to install these extensions and I kindly ask that you not block ads on Thurrott so we can continue to keep the lights on.
Seeing that these two extensions are now available for Edge is a big win for the browser as many power users consider them critical for navigating the web. While it may be a small victory for Edge, it's one that will fulfill a big request by many users. Additionally, this gets more users into the Windows Store and downloading content which is a key metric Microsoft has been trying to improve with users running Windows 10.
Extensions are a feature that Edge needs to help it compete with Chrome which recently overtook Internet Explorer for being the most popular web browser. Once the feature arrives for everyone this summer with the Anniversary update, Edge will be on a more level playing field with Chrome when it comes to feature parity.

Scientist Sets Record Straight on Medieval Warming Research
Posted on 31 March 2012 by greenman3610
This is a re-post from Climate Crocks regarding the myth that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than present.
Yesterday I reported that the newest bogus climate denial meme rocketing around the Foxis of Evil had been disavowed by Geochemist Zunli Lu. At first all I had was a short message indicating that the Daily Mail Newspaper, and reporter Ted Thornhill had deliberately decided to publish a piece that Dr. Lu told them contained the wrong ‘angle”.
Now we have Dr. Lu's more complete statement.
Syracuse University:
Recently published climate research by Zunli Lu, a geochemist in the Department of Earth Sciences in Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences, has gone viral across the Internet by bloggers. A number of media outlets, including theDaily Mail and The Register, which are published in the United Kingdom, claim this research supports arguments that human-induced global warming is a myth. The claims, Lu says, misrepresent their work and the conclusions in the study. The statement below is an effort to set the record straight. The original news story about the research is posted on Arts and Sciences News. Zunli Lu:
“It is unfortunate that my research, “An ikaite record of late Holocene climate at the Antarctic Peninsula,” recently published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, has been misrepresented by a number of media outlets. Several of these media articles assert that our study claims the entire Earth heated up during medieval times without human CO2
emissions. We clearly state in our paper that we studied one site at the Antarctic Peninsula. The results should not be extrapolated to make assumptions about climate conditions across the entire globe. Other statements, such as the study “throws doubt on orthodoxies around global warming,” completely misrepresent our conclusions. Our study does not question the well-established anthropogenic warming trend.”
Fake Science, Deliberate Distortions for Tea Party Yokels
In one of the clearest demonstrations in memory of the gullible and credulous nature of the the pathetic yokels that frequent such sites as Wattsupwiththat and Climatedepot, this obviously distorted meme was picked up and broadcast uncritically (remarkable, considering the source) around the world.
For more contextual information, see my post of yesterday.
If you are going to write about fiendishly difficult and involved matters of science and technology, it is not necessary to be an actual scientist, although that helps. What IS necessary is to scrupulously refer back to real science, real scientists, and primary sources. I've built the reputation of this blog and this video series on that premise, and that is my commitment to my readers.
Climate Crocks eviscerated a similarly bogus meme some time ago in a video entitled “Birth of a Climate Crock”. Watch that and compare to see how the technique works, and who the players are.
Steven Nelson Was Strangled, Kicked 30 Times With Steel-Toed Boots
A gay Idaho man was brutally murdered last week, left naked and alone to die, after responding to an online ad for a male escort.
Four men are charged with first-degree murder in the death of Steven Nelson, 49, who was choked and kicked about 30 times with steel-toed boots on Friday following an apparent robbery, according to police. They are not currently facing hate crime charges.
Nelson, who worked at Boise State University, had responded to the ad on the website Backpage, according to The Idaho Press-Tribune.
Nelson later picked up one of the suspects, 22-year-old Kelly Schneider, at a Wal-Mart in Nampa before driving them to an area known as Gotts Point, near Lake Lowell. After Nelson offered to pay Schneider for sex, another man arrived with a rifle.
That's when Schneider threw Nelson to the ground and began choking and kicking him, KTVB.com reports. Two other men also showed up, and the suspects took Nelson's clothes, wallet and car keys before forcing them to tell them the PIN number for their credit cards.
After the suspects drove off in their car, Nelson walked naked to a nearby home. They were taken to the hospital, but died hours later from cardiac arrest.
"A lot of people whom I've personally talked to think it's a hate crime," Becky Tallent, Nelson's former journalism professor at the University of Idaho, told the Press-Tribune. "If you are targeting a group of people to harm them, it is a hate crime."
Prosecutors: Lake Lowell suspects used Backpage ad to lure murder victim into trap https://t.co/UItt2YtQau pic.twitter.com/gXUYX0b8PH â€” KTVB.COM (@KTVB) May 3, 2016
Schneider, 21-year-old Kevin Tracy, 28-year-old Jayson Woods and 23-year-old Daniel Henkel were arrested and charged with murder and robbery, KTVB reports. Schneider faces an additional charge of grand theft. If convicted, all four could face up to life in prison or the death penalty. Sheriff Kieran Donahue told KTVB the four men were part of "a conspiracy ring" that robbed others who answered ads for sex in the past, and is urging those victims to come forward.
Denise Bennett, another one of Nelson's former journalism professors, called them a "bright, creative, passionate person" who had "an excellent sense of humor."
When Nelson was Bennett's student, they were featured in a documentary they produced, "Little Blue Dots," about the challenges LGBT people face living in red states like Idaho.

During a media briefing in the US capital a few days ago, State Department spokesperson John Kirby struggled to respond to questions regarding the difference for Saudi Arabia's bombing campaign in Yemen, which the US supports, and Russia's bombing campaign in Syria, which the US condemns. Both have led to civilian loss of life. Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen has killed over 10,000 people, a majority of them civilians, since early 2015 while Russian airstrikes have claimed the lives of 1,700 in the past year.
The US itself has also caused tremendous loss of civilian life in Syria. A group of independent journalists found that just one week's worth of US airstrikes had killed 459 civilians, with more than 100 of those being children. The death toll is likely much higher has the US has launched 5,700 airstrikes since it began its “temporary” bombing campaign meant to target ISIS in 2014. However, much international scrutiny has recently been focused on the Saudi war in Yemen as an air strike on the Yemeni capital targeted a packed funeral hall this Saturday, killing 140 civilians and injuring scores more. Saudi Arabia has denied culpability and claims they will investigate the incident.
At the media briefing, Matt Lee of the Associated Press posed the following question to Kirby: “Over the weekend there was this air strike on a funeral by the Saudi-led coalition. I was just wondering: does the administration see any difference between this kind of thing, and what you accuse the Russians, Syrians and the Iranians of doing in Syria, and particularly Aleppo?” Kirby attempted to answer the question by saying “Well yeah I think there are. […] Look there are a couple things” before an awkward and uncomfortable silence set in. Kirby eventually said that the Saudi's promised to launch an investigation of the funeral hall incident while the Russians had done no such nothing. However, Russia did indeed call for an investigation into the bombing of a UN aid convoy on September 19th.
Lee continued to press Kirby on the Yemeni issues, asking:
“an increasing number of Yemeni civilians are at risk and being killed by weapons that the United States has furnished to the Saudis and their coalition partners. You don't find any kind of issue with this? Because a lot of people do, including on [Capitol] Hill.”
The question follows accusations of US co-guilt for Saudi war crimes in Yemen, as the Obama administration has sold $115 billion in weapons to the Saudis, significantly more than any previous presidential administration. Kirby insisted that Syria and Yemen were different as the Iran-backed rebellion in Yemen, whom the Saudis are fighting, had killed Saudi citizens. 100 Saudis have died from Yemeni rebel attacks, the vast majority of them Saudi security forces. They went on to say “The Saudi-led coalition were invited in by the Yemeni government – now I know what you're going to say, the Russians were invited by [Syrian President] Assad… but [the Saudis] are under real threat on their side of the border in that war.” What Kirby failed to say is that the US has always protected and funded Saudi Arabia due to powerful deals brokered in the 1970s and, since then, have failed to condemn or even scrutinize the country known for its atrocious human rights record and funding of terrorists. However, as Kirby's floundering performance showed, this dirty little secret is getting harder and harder to cover up.
Watch John Kirby's full response to Matt Lee's question below:

Garth Greenwell is out to wreck you with their breathtaking debut novel, What Belongs to You. In it, an American expat teaching English in Bulgaria falls for Mitko, an enigmatic, young gay hustler. Predicated on lust, money, and manipulation, their relationship is doomed from the start. But what could easily have been a trite and tragic tale of unrequited love instead becomes a haunting meditation on the anatomy of desire itself. Why do we crave the things that hurt? What continues to draw these men together? They ache for such very different ends, yet inevitably return to the same disturbing patterns of dysfunction. The novel's stark Eastern European stage, combined with Greenwell's layered and lyrical prose, make for a story at once brutal and beautiful to behold. What Belongs to You is true, heartbreaking art; it belongs on your bookshelf.

[Editor's note: This report, albeit over a year late in doing so, has provided confirmation of what VT reported about the supply of weapons to the terrorist mercenaries in Syria.
We reported how the weapons were shipped from Ukraine across the black sea to the port of Batumi in Georgia then trucked south through Turkey. We also disclosed the German origins of much of this weaponry which had been legitimately supplied to Ukraine to re-equip it's tattered armed forces, but instead of going to the Ukrainian forces had been sold on by the utterly corrupt and criminal Poroshenko mafia regime in Kiev.
Former president of Georgia and mafia kingpin Mikhail Saakashvilli was placed in charge of this smuggling when they were installed as mayor of the port of Odessa.
Bulgaria was the source of much of the ammunition as that country still produces large quantities of munitions in the calibres used by the former Soviet Union such as 122mm and 152mm artillery shells and 7.62×39 and 7.62x54R small arms ammunition.
The other route for arms into Syria was over the Golan Heights from Israel or across the Jordanian border, in both cases, this was an Israeli-run operation.
Behind it all is Saudi finance, and until recently, Qatari money was used too.
VT had it all long before anyone else, and while we find this confirmation of our information gratifying, we cannot help but feel it is too little, too late. Ian]
The Russian Center for Reconciliation in Syria reported that the ISIL and al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front or the Levant Liberation Board) terrorist groups receive a major part of their financial resources and arms and ammunition in Syria from the western states.
The Arabic website of Sputnik news agency quoted the center as reporting that there is a strong body of evidence proving that the ISIL and al-Nusra used West-made weapons and received them via Israel and Ukraine.
Also, Vladimir Evseev, the head of the Department of Eurasian Integration and Development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), said that Saudi Arabia has sent the US-made anti-tank TOW missiles for the terrorists in Syria.
Meantime, Russian Vismaya Gazzetta daily reported that the Kuwaiti interior ministry has disclosed that importers of weapons to Syria, buy the arms and ammunitions in Ukraine and then transfer them to the ISIL-held areas through Turkey.
It also reported that Bulgaria is one of the biggest resources for terrorists to supply arms, adding that the Bulgarian journalists have discovered a ship under the Danish flag named ‘Marian Danika' which was loaded with arms and instruments to carry weapons for the ISIL and al-Nusra terrorists.
In a relevant development in March, the Syrian army troops discovered several ISIL hideouts stashed with a large volume of US-manufactured weapons and ammunition in the Northern province of Aleppo.
Sputnik quoted a military source as saying that the army has discovered three hideouts of ISIL in Aleppo province used by the terrorist group as arms depot and temporary jails for women, adding that a large volume of US-made arms and munitions have been found in the hideouts.
Also one of the jailed women in the hideouts said that ISIL killed a number of female prisoners who had rejected the terrorists' various demands.
In the meantime, Commander of Russia's International Mine Action Center Ivan Gromov disclosed in late December that a large volume of weapons, manufactured in the US, Germany and Bulgaria, were discovered as Russian sappers were on a mine clearance mission in Eastern Aleppo.
“Ammunition and large-caliber arms together with rockets for Grad multiple launch systems have been found there. The shells have been produced in Germany, the United States and Bulgaria,” Gromov said.
The Russian combat engineers also found 122mm mortar shells, rockets for multiple launch rocket systems, hand grenades, grenade launchers and howitzer projectiles in one of the militants' headquarters, the commander said, adding that the ammunition discovered there were in such a large quantity that they would be enough for a battalion.

The chorus is gone. This time Chris Bosh will be singing solo.
To Shane Battier, what the Miami Heat have undergone since their retirement after the 2013-14 season, including the reduction of the Big Three to a single remaining component, is nothing more than modern-day NBA recalibration.
But because the show must go on, in this case the annual fundraising night of karaoke better known as Battioke, Battier said he, like the Heat, must embrace change.
"That is the new NBA," Battier said of a Heat roster that has been reduced to Bosh and Udonis Haslem as the last men standing from when the team went to the 2014 NBA Finals. "You have a much higher turnover of the rosters now. There is a pressure to win. There is an immense pressure to come up with a formula that wins. So I don't think you'll see organizations that will, in terms of roster design, stay as intact as we have seen in the past."
Just two years ago, Battier's fundraiser counted LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as headliners. This time, Battier said Bosh has committed to next Thursday's event at Ball & Chain in Miami, even amid the uncertainty of Bosh's status for a Heat training camp that opens five days later.

"I think part of the reason Battioke is fun is because it's so fluid," Battier said of their event that raises money for college scholarships through the Battier Take Charge Foundation. "It's always a good challenge to bring new performers in. Like this year, we have the Big Show from WWE fame. We have some of the favorites like Chris Bosh, Udonis Haslem. But I always try to bring a few special guests that are secret right now. But that's part of the fun. You don't know who's going to show up at Battioke and bring some flavor."
Previous renditions of the event have drawn Heat owner Micky Arison and Heat President Pat Riley, which could make Bosh's scheduled appearance intriguing beyond song selection, in light of the All-Star forward's campaign to be cleared to return from the blood clots that have sidelined them the second half of the past two seasons.
And yet it is another former Battioke regular, Wade, who will be notable by their expected absence, having departed in the offseason in free agency to the Chicago Bulls.
"I was more surprised when Kevin Durant went to Golden State to be honest with you," Battier said of the former Oklahoma City Thunder forward. "Yeah, D-Wade had a fantastic run and the Miami Heat loved them for it. You know, I think they just wanted to see what else was out there and see what else the NBA had to offer. And it doesn't diminish what they accomplished or their feelings toward Miami. And before they left, I think they just wanted to see what it was like to walk into Triple-A arena as a visitor. Knowing D-Wade, it'll never diminish what they mean to Miami and the Heat."
As with the Heat, Battier's event has stepped back from the ultimate limelight.
"Obviously when we had the Big Three and were winning championships," they said, "that's a whole different level of hysteria that Battioke brought."
What hasn't changed is Battier's commitment to their philanthropic efforts in South Florida.
"I'm really excited this Battioke will bring us back to the people, bring it back to Calle Ocho," they said. "It's going to be a more intimate Battioke where we will, as always, touch the people.
"We started a college counseling supplemental program in Miami-Dade schools. We realized that college counselors are understaffed. And we wanted to help them inspire kids to realize, 'You know what, college is a possibility. If you want to work for it, there are resources and there are paths you can follow to get to college.' That's what this Battioke is for, to raise money to bring more resources to help inspire more kids to go to college."
As for Battier, retirement has been a nostalgic but relaxing process for the key cog to the Heat's two NBA championships during the Big Three era.
"I miss my guys and I miss the completion. Those are the two things that are not replicated," they said. "My body feels great. My body is saying to me, 'I feel fantastic.' And it's fun to be just a regular dad and sit in carpool and do all those fun things. I miss the locker room and the competition, not the grind."
Battioke will be held Thursday Sept. 22 at 7:30 p.m. at Ball & Chain at 1513 SW 8th Street in Miami. Tickets are $100 and attendees must be 21 or older. Details are available at http://battioke.org.

Payouts declined on Wall Street this year, as the major financial firms tried to steer through several quarters of lawsuits, layoffs, jittery markets, and public opprobrium. Yet the earnings reports of the past several days have mainly served as a reminder that whether times are good or bad, people on Wall Street tend to make a lot of money.
Compensation at Goldman Sachs may be down almost 15 percent from last year, but the firm still had enough to pay its employees an average of $367,057 in salary, bonuses and benefits. Compensation cuts at JPMorgan's investment-banking arm brought down the employee average more than 7.5 percent -- but even so, that average was still $341,552, according to reports. That's almost 10 times greater than the average salary for all American workers, which is just $37,128 a year. And most of those workers aren't at companies that underwent such massive losses just a few years ago that the government had to step in and rescue them.
What's going on? Why do employees in the financial industry get paid so well? At a time when millions of Americans are out of work or barely making ends meet -- thanks to a recession hastened by a financial crisis in which the country's largest banks were central participants -- how is Wall Street able to take home the cash that it does?
This September, when the protesters of Occupy Wall Street first set up camp in lower Manhattan, one of the many messages chalked on the Zuccotti Park sidewalk read, "BANKS CREATE NOTHING." This isn't quite true. The purpose of a financial system is to shift capital around in ways that make the economy grow. Yet in recent years, that function has been less of a priority at many major banks than the generation of enormous in-house profits, mostly through the manipulation of assets already on the books.
Proprietary trading, for instance -- where banks gamble on the direction of markets and instruments using their own money -- is one of the most lucrative pursuits a financial firm can engage in. It's also seen as highly risky, particularly by former Federal Reserve chairperson Paul Volcker, who initially devised the so-called Volcker Rule to keep proprietary trading in check, though extensive revision and legislative resistance have put the future of these efforts in question.
Those who study the industry are quick to point out that not all Wall Street pay packages are created equal. As in most other areas of the economy, the people at the top make more than the people in the middle -- sometimes much, much more. This past year, the compensation for highly-placed financial executives was between 50 and 100 times greater than that of the average employee, according to one analysis.
"The financial industry has its own version of the 99 percent and the 1 percent," Michael Mayo, a banking analyst for CLSA, told The Huffington Post. "It's almost a tale of two cities in a way."
At the same time, Wall Street's pay scale remains a stark outlier when compared to the rest of society. In 1981, in New York City, the average worker in the securities industry was making about twice as much as the average employee in any other part of the private sector. By 2010, adjusted for inflation, the average securities salary had soared to more than five times the average salary for all other private workers in the city. During a 30-year period when the incomes of most employees, no matter what their job, hardly grew at all, pay on Wall Street has accelerated dramatically -- even as major financial institutions were making moves that would eventually jeopardize the whole economy.
The comparison to 1981 is illustrative, since it was the administration of Ronald Reagan, inaugurated that year as president, that provided so much momentum to the deregulatory trend that largely characterized the relationship between Washington and big business until the financial crisis.
Reagan dismantled the regulatory framework around the savings and loan industry. Bill Clinton rolled back the Glass-Steagall Act, allowing commercial and investment banks to blend their operations. George W. Bush presided over a bout of largely unmonitored mortgage lending and trading that inflated the economy before puncturing it. These and other instances of retreat from government oversight made it possible for banks to take greater risks with more money, which in turn led to the higher and higher accrual of capital at financial firms.
It's also been argued that measures like the 1998 bailout of the sagging hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, a rescue effort spearheaded by the Federal Reserve, likely contributed to a sense on Wall Street that it was okay to edge ever further out onto risky limbs, since the government was demonstrably willing to step in if the situation demanded it. Even as bigger gambles were bringing more and more money in, banks were figuring out ways to hold on to more of it, devising strategies to alleviate their tax burdens. Wells Fargo, for example, saved almost $18 billion in tax breaks between 2008 and 2010, and Goldman Sachs paid just 1.1 percent of its 2008 income in taxes.
In recent years, competitive pressure -- the concern that banking employees and executives will simply jump to another company if it offers more impressive pay packages -- has also contributed to a rise in compensation levels. Hedge funds have begun piling new charges on top of their existing management fees. Bonus payouts for financial firm employees, meanwhile, have often borne only a loose relation to those firms' actual yearly performance. While banks haven't been immune to the economic slowdown that took hold in 2008, it's hard to make the argument that they've suffered: Wall Street firms made more in profits during the first 30 months of Barack Obama's presidency than they did during George W. Bush's eight years in office.
People affiliated with the financial industry point out that many Wall Street employees work long hours, cope with enormous pressure, and have relatively little job security. Moreover, jobs at major financial firms usually require skill sets and a level of education that not everyone possesses. It's common to hear the argument that Wall Street pay levels should reflect the demands of the job.
"You have to keep in mind, at the end of the day -- a large, successful professional services firm, its primary assets are its employees," one compensation consultant told The Huffington Post. At the same time, they said, "paying people regardless of performance, which is what you do when you pay them bigger and bigger salaries, is something you have to think about."
Michael Mayo, whose book "Exile On Wall Street" addresses the topic of swollen compensation in the financial industry, was more pointed in their assessment.
When it comes to the social value of what banks do, they told HuffPost, "pay has not been commensurate with the contribution." For senior-level bankers to rake in six- and seven-figure sums while their companies make misstep after misstep, they said, sends the worst possible signal to people in other industries -- not to mention the ordinary American taxpayer who has to watch it all happen.

I'm a musician, not a lawyer. But for the past year, I've been asking my friends to sign letters with language like this:
I am opposed to the efforts from technology corporations to exploit works that they identify as “orphan works” online with no compensation to the creators. I oppose the fair use exception being applied to the mass digitization of orphan works. Fair use is too broad an exception for this activity.
If this stuff makes your eyes glaze over, you're not alone: I need a lot of caffeine. I persist because I've witnessed, over the past few years, a relentless attack on the basic rights of myself and my “creative” colleagues. I've experienced the damage this attack is causing in my community and I've lived long enough to know that it doesn't have to be this way.
Change is inevitable: exploitation isn't.
A major battleground of this attack is the ongoing “copyright reform” hearings in Washington, DC. What should have been a reasonable discussion on how to make the copyright system work for all parties has become an aggressive power grab on the part of Google and other tech corporate giants. As you can see from the snippet quoted above, the issues are incredibly complex: but the results will be simple: the devaluation and destruction of our livelihoods and art forms.
We don't have much time:
“…if the creative community doesn't intervene now, and by now, I mean, fucking now — we will be bound to a multigenerational clusterfuck that will take 40 to 50 years to unravel.”
— Kurt Sutter, executive producer and showrunner of the FX drama series Sons of Anarchy, in an open letter in Variety magazine, August 5, 2014.
I'll return to the issues in a bit. First, I'd like to tell a story — a true one — about how these seemingly nerdy details of copyright law can make a big difference in the lives of artists and the vitality of a culture.
Long before Google existed, it was common for publishing companies not to mail out composers' royalty checks unless the composer complained. Inevitably, some wouldn't, and the publishers could pocket the money. For middle-level composers, it was a common scam.
One such composer was my guitar teacher Frantz Casseus (aka “the father of Haitian classical guitar”). Frantz, after emigrating from Haiti in 1948, had put out several records on Folkways, and once had a tune covered by Harry Belafonte — but they aren't rich, not by a long shot. I took my weekly lessons in their tiny rent-controlled apartment on West 87th Street in Manhattan, surrounded by the clutter of sheet music, eternally morphing home-made furniture and the Brazilian rosewood of half-finished guitars.
Frantz supplemented their composer's publishing checks by editing guitar books, making guitars, concertizing and, luckily for me, teaching. They lived very simply, but they got by.
Things became difficult as Frantz's publishing income began to dry up in the '70s. In the mid '80s, they suffered a series of strokes that left them unable to play guitar. A friend who had volunteered to help get their finances in order figured out that income was being blocked, and confronted the publishing company. They responded predictably: “Oh, we just didn't know where to send the checks.” Frantz had lived at the same address and with the same published phone number for over 40 years.
Several months later, a check for $16,000 arrived, representing decades of unpaid income. By this time, Frantz had been forced onto Medicaid — so everything that went into their bank account went straight to the government. Still, it wasn't the financial loss that bothered Frantz most. What they said as they stood there, finally holding the long-delayed check in their hand, was this: “If I had known, I would have composed more. I felt my work to be without value.”
These days, as the attack on artists' rights threatens to make Frantz's loss into the new normal, placing access to rights beyond the means of most creators and increasing the vulnerability of musicians exponentially, I'm often haunted by Frantz's words.
I feel a ghost in the room when governmental roundtables of distinguished stakeholders discuss the strength of the protections and incentives our founding fathers created copyright to provide. And then Big Tech's corporate accountants provide mountains of data on the dangers (to them) of providing too strong a protection.
But who will speak for the works of art left uncreated if the protections are too weak? Who represents the work aborted, abandoned, or never undertaken in the first place? What accountant can place a value on the loss from a work's absence? Who speaks for the discouraged, tired of being unvalued, who walked away from their gift? Or protests the loss of the ineffable, immeasurable might-have-been?
Frantz died less than a year after receiving their check, leaving behind a body of work beloved by Haitians and classical guitar fans to this day. If we judge the work Frantz might have composed by the work they actually did, then the loss — to Frantz of the dignity of work, to the public of the beauty their work might have created — is profound.
I should add two things:
Although the publishing scam described above remains common, other forms of theft occur much less frequently. For example, using copyrighted material in films or television commercials without a proper license is relatively rare. Why? Because composers/artists have effective recourse. In the end, Frantz got their check: for all its abuse by corrupt institutions and individuals, the system functioned: most working composers, artists and musicians got paid.
Frantz's human tragedy and our cultural loss come down, at the end of the day, to details of law: to the presence or absence of the legal protections now under discussion in the copyright reform process.
Which is why it matters to me when I see corporate lobbyists aggressively trying to use this process to create a new legal landscape in which their drive to profit without paying creators will be unobstructed, while our tools to win fairness will be greatly reduced or obliterated. And they're trying to go one better than the publishing scams of yesteryear: they want to put virtually all uses of our work in the same legally vulnerable position that enabled their publishers to rip off Frantz — and many others. They want to eliminate the recourse that enabled Frantz's diligent friend — actually, it was my mom, Harriet — to win some form of justice.
And they've become rich and powerful enough to get away with it.
The way things were been far from perfect, but at least there was a common understanding that not paying the composer or artist was cheating.
This is no longer true.
Google brokers ads to ad-based black marketeers (aka “pirates”). I'm not talking about college kids file-sharing with their friends. These large-scale commercial enterprises exist to sell ad space, uploading tens of thousands of files as bait. Without the ad sales, they wouldn't exist. Artists/composers get nothing. However, Google is protected by the “safe harbor” clause of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. None of their profit goes to paying for the work that made it possible.
On Google-owned YouTube, creators receive a small percentage when work we post is streamed. But when others post our work we get nothing. We're allowed to file DMCA take-down notices, but the violator can re-post our material again almost immediately. Google could stop this unauthorized use — other legal file-sharing services do — but they choose not to. They sell ad space whether the post is authorized or not. None of this profit is shared with artists.
And so our work is fast becoming economically unsustainable: not because some “disruptive technology” has found a better or cheaper way to make what we make, not because people no longer listen to our music, but because the current legal framework permits huge corporations to profit off our work without paying us.
The corporations that don't pay us are driving those that do out of business.
And so it goes: the bean-counters continue to count beans — and those not counted disappear. The utter banality of this fact does not lessen the loss. Lest we forget, these bureaucratic details are what evil looks like in our world — and, notwithstanding their famous motto (“don't be evil”), there's a whole lot of devil in the arcane details of Google et al.'s Copyright Office testimony.
“Value”
When Frantz Casseus felt deprived of value those years when the checks stopped coming, it wasn't because they were “in it for the money” — Frantz was easily the least materialistic person I've ever met. They dropped out of law school in Port-au-Prince, giving up what could have been a comfortable life as a civil servant, so they could become an artist and move (in 1948) to an America that often didn't hold black men with foreign accents in high regard. I never heard them voice a word of complaint; they were doing what they loved.
But for better and for worse, money is how value is measured in our society — it's how we know others care about what we do — and yes, it's how we survive. And until the day when that ceases to be true for all society, we musicians, recording artists, writers, photographers, filmmakers, graphic artists — we who create so-called “content,” we who do the work of art — are going to ask to be paid for our work, just like any other group of working Americans, no matter how many trolls, most of whose garages are bigger than Frantz's entire apartment, attack us for being “only in it for the money” whenever we have the courage to speak out.
We're organizing to fight back. We're going to give value to the ineffable, uncountable and immeasurable beauty being destroyed. We're going to give voice to the creators whose work — and lives — are being devalued by tech-corporate greed. We're going to fight for the sustainability of the culture we all enjoy. We don't have the lobbying millions of the tech-corporate giants, but we're going to win. Because the truth is a powerful slingshot.

2 1/2 cups All Purpose Flour
2 Tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup vegan butter
6 Tablespoon vegan shortening
1/2 cup cold water
Additional 9 Tablespoon water
Directions for Pie Crust:
Whisk the dry ingredients together and cut in vegan butter.
Carefully work water into the dough. (pour in some of the water, and start to mix it with your hands). This recipe is good for 2 pie crusts. So cut the ball of dough in half.
Wrap the dough balls in plastic wrap, compress it until it looks like a disc, and put in the chiller for 1 hour.
Roll out your vegan pie crust. And carefully put it in the pie plate. Don't worry if it starts to rip, that will happen. Just try your best to carefully piece it together.
Tuck in the edges, if you have a bag of beans, place that in the center of the pie crust and bake at 325 for 8 minutes. If you do not have a bag of beans handy, just use a fork and poke around the pie crust so it won't rise. Ingredients for Pecan Filling:
7 ounces sugar
7 ounces brown sugar
1 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup margarine
12 ounces SILKEN tofu
4 ounces non-dairy milk
4 Tablespoon corn starch
1 tsp salt
2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups pecans Directions for Pecan Filling:
Heat sugars to boil. Boil lightly for 10 minutes. The mix will thicken.
Off heat, add the margarine and melt. Cool to room temperature.
Puree the tofu, non-dairy milk, and corn starch until silky smooth.
Combine this mix, the salt, and vanilla.
Add sugar mix to tofu. Mix and combine.
Place pecans into pie shell and add filling.
Bake at 325 until set. (20-30 minutes)
Happy Tuesday everyone! I hope everybody had a fantastic weekend! I am excited to be writing yet another recipe for you guys, and it is something I do hope a lot of you enjoy!This week I would like to use a recipe we learned in school. VEGAN PECAN PIE! Courtesy of the Culinary Institute of Virginia having a nutrition program, we had a course in that program called "Alternative Baking". Which was really fun because we got to learn the different types of dietary needs, and the many alternatives to those diets (i.e. Vegan, Gluten Free, Sugar Free, Raw/Paleo, etc.) for all those yummy desserts everybody wants to have! Anyways, the two areas I enjoyed the most was vegan, and gluten free. Learning how to make pecan pie was a lot of fun as well. A few of the groups in our class got to make the vegan pecan pie (Pictured above). And it was quite an easy recipe to put together.There is not a whole lot to be done with this recipe either. We are just omitting the eggs, and substituting the butter in the recipe, but everything else stays the same. Remember when we talked about how we can put some tofu in certain foods or desserts as a substitute? That's right, this recipe calls for none other than silken tofu!! Tofu is a great substitute for when a recipe originally calls for eggs. It is a great binder for desserts like this. But if you recall, I did give out a little warning about what types of Tofu to use! That's right. This recipe requires silken tofu because it is easier to puree, and overall works better when it comes to desserts. You should use extra firm tofu ONLY if you are looking for a hearty replacement for certain dishes (it stays in shape for the breading and frying process). Silken tofu is the best to use for desserts, smoothies, souffles, etc. IF you end up using extra firm tofu, your pecan pie will look just like the one in the picture below. I tried pureeing, chopping, blending, everything you can imagine to that extra firm tofu to try and get it smooth enough for this recipe. Unfortunately, it did not work out at all and ended up ruining my pecan pie.Overall, the texture for me was odd at first because I knew there was tofu in the dish. And usually, once you know there's something in there, it is all you focus on tasting. BUT, once I actually opened up my mind to the idea of adding tofu to pecan pie, it really was not bad. I did not think it was sweet enough in my opinion, but I did not want to break away from the recipe. If you prefer your pecan pie sweeter, add an additional teaspoon of vanilla extract and an additional 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Overall, I hope y'all enjoy this recipe. We are getting closer to the holiday season guys! If you have any recipes you want us to write about, please feel free to message us!Have a great rest of the week!-MarandaIngredients for Pie Crust:
Trading privacy for convenience is a common theme in the digital age. As handsets look poised to replace fingerprint identification with facial recognition for core tasks like screen unlock, payment and app logins, a new forum for debate has emerged.
Apple is betting consumers will choose convenience with their recent announcement of FaceID and the iPhoneX. Al Franken, the junior U.S. Senator from Minnesota, who previously challenged Apple's TouchID on privacy grounds in 2013, raised their hand similarly this September via open letter to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, regarding consumer privacy and FaceID.
Apple's response centered around the presence of secure, embedded AI-ready hardware as a cure-all solution to Franken's consumer privacy and data security concerns. Elsewhere in tech, this embedded-AI privacy cure appears to be driving considerable investment by many tech giants.
San Diego's Qualcomm has recently shipped a line of embedded-AI chips that possess powerful AI capabilities for off-cloud, on-device processing of face data. Touting embedded-AI and security, the Snapdragon 835 for high-end Android devices and the Snapdragon 636 for the mid-range enable the kind of local processing necessary to accomplish facial recognition tasks entirely on device. With nearly 40% of Android's device System-on-Chip (SoC) market in Q3 of 2016, according to smartphone benchmark tool Antutu, Qualcomm's lead may grow on the back of these competitive features.
Regulations may stunt growth
If market signaling suggests facial recognition may be a core component of future devices, what exactly are the trade-offs in play for consumers when unlocking their phone or paying for a cup of coffee? Concerns range from easier government access to data to normalization of face-scanning in the mass-market. Some consumers may even question the practical convenience of the feature altogether. Despite the embedded-AI security argument touted by Apple, Qualcomm and others, the consumer debate is likely to continue and governments may be keen to regulate facial recognition data, fair use and standards.
One such example of regulations intersecting with face data is the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) which governs rules of engagement for businesses seeking to use fingerprints, iris scans, facial data and other biometric identifiers. While BIPA is isolated to the state of Illinois, several other states have adopted modified versions of the Act, most notably Texas and Washington State.
BIPA has not yet yielded any high-profile decisions with relation to facial recognition data, but recent years have seen in-progress class actions against tech heavyweights like Google, Facebook and Snapchat listed on the defendant line in BIPA lawsuits.
Rapid Adaption in China
While the U.S. struggles to define consent and fair use of facial recognition data, regulation and adoption of facial recognition is a far different story in China. The world's largest smartphone market has seen the use of facial recognition skyrocket on and off devices for both convenience and surveillance purposes. Private enterprise has rapidly embraced the technology for a variety of purposes, from paying for a bucket of chicken at KFC to check-in at the airport.
Without a clear public debate, provincial and local Chinese governments are becoming more efficient as well. Advanced facial recognition is being used to haul in wanted criminals while at the same time being used to combat jaywalking. With the U.S. pondering the privacy implications of this rapidly advancing technology, it seems China's embrace may know few bounds.
Some tech pundits see this as one of the clear signs that China will rise to dominate research and advancements in AI in coming years. The ability to test new technologies at scale without regulation pressure is very powerful for researchers and private enterprise. Considering the deep commercialization gap between a simple phone unlock method in the U.S. and the multitude of uses already popping up in China, countering the argument is very difficult. Perhaps due to this ample training ground for AI, Western firms are very protective of access to the Chinese market.
Embedded Artificial Intelligence
Market acceptance and demand for facial recognition aside, Qualcomm's investments suggest that the chip market is in the midst of a new competitive phase focused squarely on embedded-AI. Whether driven by data privacy concerns or the usual performance market forces, “greens fees” for chipmakers have clearly shifted to include embedded-AI capabilities. Qualcomm's closest rival, Taiwan chipmaker MediaTek, launched their Helio line earlier this year boasting similarly impressive embedded-AI capabilities.
This shift is unique in pulling other household-name tech companies into Embedded-AI. Promising a local data-privacy use-case, Intel's acquisition of Movidius earlier this year produced the first mass-market AI USB device (Neural Compute Stick – NCS). Google's fresh investments in HTC's smartphone unit suggest consumers may see the Google-developed Tensor-Processing-Unit (TPU) making similar claims via embedded-AI as a cure for smartphone data privacy concerns.
Apple and Qualcomm at odds
Qualcomm recently filed a series patent violation lawsuits in China against Apple amid Apple's concerns over waning market share in the country. Add this to signs that FaceID and the iPhoneX may not be seen as a novelty by Chinese consumers at the Apple price point and it looks like 2018 may be a tough road for the company in China.
Meanwhile, as China has rapidly normalized the use of facial recognition, the U.S. still remains in regulatory stasis. The enforceability of legislation like BIPA for facial recognition data remains to be seen and the delay of judgement seems to be in U.S. tech companies' best interests. Delay is certain to yield benefits and allow technology to advance to address the U.S. market, but at what competitive costs?
While the embedded-AI approach lead by Apple and Qualcomm appears to address current U.S. regulations, will the U.S. be able to move forward quickly toward commercialization? As we wait for a definitive answer and compelling use cases, China's commercialization of facial recognition may only continue to accelerate.
KMB looks to the Sun to keep idling buses cool
KMB looks to the Sun to keep idling buses cool
Joanne Wong reports
Kowloon Motor Bus has developed a solar power system for its double-decker buses that can help to idle vehicles keep cool and also provide electricity for phone chargers.
The system which uses 20 solar panels, covering two-thirds of a bus roof, will be tried out on one bus as a test first.
When the bus is idling with engines switched off, the system will power an air ventilator which will keep the insides of the vehicle cooler even when the bus is parked under a hot sun.
KMB engineer Kenneth Lo said the system can reduce temperatures inside the bus by five to ten degrees Celsius. This could be a blessing to both drivers and passengers as the temperature inside buses parked in an open terminal or depot could get up to 40 degrees Celsius.
When the engine is started, the power generated by solar cells will be stored in a battery and used for USB charging facilities in the bus.
Lo assured that the system works well even on a cloudy day. "We've done this test before, still be able to charge the battery and also supply the electricity to the USB charging ports," they said.
The bus company declined to reveal the cost of the new system, but said the bus fares would not be affected.
This deck uses Odric, Lunarch Marshal to create a board of unkillable badasses who will heal you up while wearing your opponent down. It is capable of winning early, but the true power of the combo is unleashed in mid and late game.
If you're not familiar with Odric, Lunarch Marshal, they give all of your creatures all of the keywords that ANY creature has, at the start of both combats. The dream is to pair Odric with Aerial Responder , Lone Rider and Gnarlwood Dryad for a squadron of flying creatures with first strike, deathtouch, lifelink, and vigilance. If you can sneak haste in there from Nissa, Vital Force or Indestrucible from Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, that's the icing on the cake.
Blossoming Defense helps protect Odric or another valuable creature by adding instant hexproofing, though this can also be gained through Lumbering Falls and Sigarda, Heron's Grace. Blossoming also pairs beautifully with Lone Rider early, and flipping them on turn 3 can often just win a game. This deck splashes blue for Negate and Dispel, which are absolutely critical to surviving in this meta, as well as the board-wipes your opponent is sure to side in. A single maindeck Fragmentize provides an easy answer to Panharmonicon, Smuggler's Copter, and Aetherworks Marvel .
Sideboarding well is extremely important when you are facing some of the current Tier1 decks out there. If they're playing a marvel deck, bring in the additional Fragmentizes, Negates, Stasis Snare, and Blessed Alliance. For vehicles and metalworks, Cataclysmic Gearhulk can be a great pull and obviously Panharmonicon calls for more fragmentizes and negates. Blue/White flash requires you to be patient. If they're playing one of the decks with only four torrential gearhulks, bait out a bunch of their counters and removal with the smaller creatures, keeping your planeswalkers available until you're sure they can't be countered. For sure, bring in all of your Negates and Dispels here. The key to beating U/W flash is patience, and a well-placed Stasis Snare.

Recap: Bulls 88, Wizards 85
By Joel Bartilotta via RotoWire.com
Posted Sat Jul 16, 2016 11:04 PM - Updated Sat Jul 16, 2016 11:04 PM
The Chicago Bulls defeated the Washington Wizards 88-85 in the quarterfinals of the Las Vegas Summer League on Saturday.
Despite Chicago leading for nearly the entire game, Washington kept it close throughout and nearly pulled out a comeback win. Both teams wanted to limit mistakes, as they combined for just 11 turnovers and six fast-break points. Bench play might have swung the tide for the Bulls, as their reserves outscored the Wizards by a 38-13 margin.
Bobby Portis continued their impressive summer league campaign, contributing 17 points and nine rebounds in the win. Rookie Denzel Valentine had one of their best games of the summer as well, collecting 14 points, 10 rebounds and three assists. Spencer Dinwiddie and Patrick Miller also provided double figures in points off the bench.
Jarell Eddie was the Wizards' top player on the night, scoring a team-high 22 points on 7-for-12 shooting to go along with six rebounds and four assists. Nate Wolters tallied 16 points, five rebounds and seven assists while Kelly Oubre contributed 17 points and seven boards, but shot just 4-for-15 from the field.
Chicago will face the winner of Saturday's Cleveland-Brooklyn matchup in the semifinals Sunday, while the Wizards finish their summer league campaign with a 3-2 record.
In 1917, Converse introduced a diamond-shaped traction system that became one of the footwear industry's most recognizable outsoles. Joined to a canvas upper, complete with a hallmark leather ankle patch and paired with a rubber toecap, the sole completed a trio of defining components in Converse's burgeoning basketball line. With traction, protection and durability accounted for, the shoe was sport-ready but not an immediate hit. Three years later, the innovative design received an appropriate name — All Star — and its journey to cultural icon began in earnest.
Now, almost a century after its initial public offering, the individual components of the Star remain while its performance has been continually refined. For instance, in 1925, a heel cushion was added, and in 1950, responding to consumer demands, a low-cut version hit basketball courts across the country. Since then, the silhouette's High and Ox styles have been worn by athletes, artists and musicians, across generations and geographies.
To get into the spirit of this post, you should probably skim through the first few slides of this presentation by Daniel Bohannon and Le Holmes given at Black Hat 2017. Who would have thunk that making PowerShell commands look unreadable would require a triple-digit slide deck?
We know PowerShell is the go to-tool for post-exploitation, allowing attackers to live off the land and prosper. Check out our pen testing Active Directory series for more proof.
However, IT security is, in theory monitoring user activities at, say, the Security Op. Center or SoC, so it should be easy to spot when a “non-normal” command is being executed.
In fact, we know that one tipoff of a PowerShell attack is when a user creates a WebClient object, calls its Downloadstring method, and then executes the string contained in the remote web page. Something like the following:
Why would an ordinary user or even for that matter an admin do this?
While this “clear text” is easy to detect by looking at the right logs in Windows and scanning for the appropriate keywords, the obfuscated version is anything but. At the end of this post, we'll show how this basic “launch cradle” used by hackers can be made to look a complete undecipherable word jumble.
PowerShell Logging
Before we take our initial dive into obfuscation, let's explore how events actually gets logged by Windows, specifically for PowerShell. Once you see the logs, you'll get a greater appreciation of what hackers are trying to hide.
To their credit, Microsoft has realized the threat possibilities in PowerShell and started improving command logging in Windows 7. You see these improvements in PowerShell versions 4 and 5.
In my own AWS environment, the Windows Server 2012 I used came equipped with version 4. It seems to have most of the advanced logging capabilities — though 5 has the latest and greatest.
From what I was able to grok reading Bohannon's great presentation and a few other Microsoft sources, you need to enable event 4688 (process creation) and then turn on auditing for the PowerShell command line. You can read more about it in this Microsoft document.
And then for even more voluminous logging, you can set policies in the GPO console to enable, for example, full transcription logging of a PowerShell (below).
No, I didn't do that for my own testing! I discovered (as many other security pros have) that when using the Windows Event Viewer things get confusing very quickly. I don't need the full power of transcription logging.
For kicks I ran a simple pipeline — Get-Process | %{Write-Host $_.Handles} — to print out process handles, and generated … an astonishing 114 events in the PowerShell log. Ofer, by the way, has a good post explaining the larger problem of correlating separate events to understand the full picture.
The good news is that from the Event Viewer, I was able to see the base command line that triggered the event cascade (above).
Release the Confusion
The goal of the attacker is to make it very difficult or impossible for security staff viewing the log to detect obvious hacking activity or, more likely, fool analytics software to not trigger when malware is loaded.
In the asupervisorstioned presentation, there's a long, involved example, showing how to obfuscate malware by exploiting PowerShell's ability to execute commands embedded in a string.
Did you know this was possible?
Or, at a more evil level, this:
Or take a look at this, which I cooked up based on my own recipe:
Yeah, PowerShell is incredibly flexible and the hackers are good at taking advantage of its features to create confusion.
You can also ponder this one, which uses environment variables in an old-fashioned Windows shell to hide the evil code and then pipe it into PowerShell:
You should keep in mind that in a PowerShell pipeline, each pipe segment runs as a separate process, which spews its own events for maximum log confusion. The goal in the above example is to use the %cmd% variable to hide the evil code.
However, from my Windows Event Viewer, I was able to spot the full original command line — though it took some digging.
In theory, you could look for the actual malware signature, which in my example is represented by “write-host evil malware”, within the Windows logs by scanning the command lines.
But hackers became very clever by making the malware signature itself invisible. That's really the example I first started with.
The idea is to use the WebClient .Net object to read the malware that's contained on a remote site and then execute it with PowerShell's Invoke-Expression. In the Event Viewer, you can't see the actual code!
This is known as fileless malware and has become very popular technique among the hackeratti. As I mentioned in the beginning, security pros can counteract this by looking instead for WebClient and Downloadstring in the command line. It's just not a normal user command, at least in my book.
A Quick Peek at Invoke-Obfuscation
This is where Bohannon's Invoke-Obfuscation tool comes into play. They spent a year exploring all kinds of PowerShell command line obfuscation techniques — and he's got the beard to prove it! —to make it almost impossible to scan for obvious keywords.
Their obfuscations are based on escape sequences and clever PowerShell programming to manipulate commands.
I loaded their Invoke-Expression app into my AWS server and tried it out for myself. We'll explore more of this tool next time, but here's what happened when I gave it the above Webclient.Downloadstring fileless command string:
Very confusing! And I was able to test the obfuscated PowerShell within their app.
Next time we'll look at more of Invoke-Obfuscation's powers and touch on new ways to spot these confusing, but highly dangerous, PowerShell scripts.
Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Del Piero have both backed Carlo Ancelotti to turn things around after their tough start as Real Madrid coach, ahead of Wednesday's match against Juventus in the Champions League.
• Rigg: Madrid needs to cement improved formula vs. Old Lady
• Rzouki: It's time for Real Madrid
Ancelotti has come in for criticism in Spain after some below par performances, but speaking ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash between Madrid and Juventus, both Cannavaro and Del Piero said their fellow Italian would soon get it right.
Cannavaro told Marca that both of their former sides were struggling to find their best form at the moment.
“The truth is that neither of the two is in good form, the start of the season is being difficult for them,” the 2006 Ballon D'Or winner said. “Madrid have changed a lot. Not just with a new coach coming in, also with very young players replacing established players like Higuain and Ozil, who were adapted to the mentality of the club. Ancelotti is looking for something different in the style and that takes time. Juve, after two magnificent years, maybe lack a bit of hunger.”
Madrid were still coming to terms with the fall-out from three intense seasons under Jose Mourinho, Cannavaro said.
“Madrid have started badly, but we are still in October and there is a long way to go,” they said. “I believe they are still coming to terms with Mourinho's departure, because they are a coach who makes a huge impression. That has happened in all the other teams they have passed through.  They are a coach who provokes a lot of tension and demands a lot. On top of that, there are the youngsters who need to adapt.”
Ancelotti was also looking to change Madrid's style of play, which took time, Cannavaro said.
“Carlo has a lot of experience to overcome this situation,” they said. “He is a coach who likes good football. They grew up in Milan and there, even though it was an Italian team, they looked after the football, it was not just all about results. I believe they are a great coach for Real Madrid.”
Cannavaro's former Italy and Juve teammate Alessandro Del Piero told AS that they were also sure that Ancelotti would soon get their message across at the Bernabeu.
“You cannot change everything from the first day,” they said. “He works from day to day, game to game, communicating their values to the team, their way of playing football. And in the end the results will come, I am sure of that. Carlo is in the group of coaches who most influenced me, together with [Marcelo] Lippi.”
Del Piero, currently at Australian side Sydney FC, recalled happy memories of playing in the Champions League against Madrid, having been part of a Juve team which squeezed past Madrid in the 2003 semifinals and last 16 in 2005, and also scoring twice in a 2-0 group stages win at the Bernabeu in November 2008.
“In my career I have received great displays of affection, in Europe and in Italy,” they said. “But above them all I remember two moments: the homage from my fans in my last game in Turin and the applause in the Bernabeu after my double in 2008. For me it counted as much as winning an individual trophy. To receive an ovation from these fans at this time was priceless. It was incredible sportsmanship from these fans, their ability to applaud an opponent, even though they were losing.”
The attacker, who turns 39 in November, denied they had been close to joining Madrid in the past, but joked that they could be available on a free transfer next summer.
“My contract in Sydney is up in a year...” they smiled.
It takes chutzpah, or perhaps just an extraordinary lack of self-awareness, to argue vehemently that a program should not be implemented — and, when it is, complain it isn't being implemented well enough.
But that seems to be the new Republican position: We want the Affordable Care Act, and we want it now.
Given that House Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal Obamacare, you'd think more of them would be cheering the “debacle” of a barely functioning Web site that keeps people from signing up. Instead, they demand to know who is responsible and insist that heads should roll.
The sense of urgency surrounding the program is palpable — and largely artificial. The Obama administration royally screwed up the launch, no question about it. But there's time to get it right. Plenty of time.
The real deadline for creating a sleek, seamless, customer-friendly Web site allowing people to buy insurance through the federal exchanges isn't three weeks or even three months. It's three years and change — the time President Obama has left in office.

The Affordable Care Act will remain the law unless its opponents win veto-proof majorities in both houses of Congress. With the GOP's approval numbers essentially down to friends and family, a landslide victory in next year's midterm election seems unlikely, to say the least. This means that as long as Obama is around, their eponymous health-care reforms will be around, too.
So everyone can take a deep breath and calm down. The state exchanges are working fine. The first task with the federal Web site is to make sure the flow of information to and from insurance companies is reliable and accurate. This whole scheme doesn't work unless insurers know whom they are insuring.
As far as the user experience is concerned, the goal right now should be to make it easier for people to do comparison shopping before the system insists on trying to verify their life stories. By the time applicants have made their decisions and are ready to buy, the Web site will probably still be clumsy and aggravating. But engineers should have applied enough duct tape and baling wire to make it at least functional.
Meanwhile, there ought to be a separate team working on a whole new Web site with different architecture. I say this as a non-techie who has only a vague notion of what “architecture” means regarding computer systems but who knows a total lemon when they see one.
“Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible,” Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said as they faced House inquisitors Wednesday in the first of what surely will be many investigative hearings.
Indeed, Sebelius must shoulder most of the responsibility for the late-night punch line that is HealthCare.gov. It's shocking that the Web site was made operational — or, in this case, nonoperational — with so little testing. It's even more shocking that the little testing that was done indicated there would be problems, yet the administration seemed unprepared when the predicted problems appeared.
But there is plenty of blame to go around. Some of it must fall on Obama, who hurt their own cause by making categorical statements about the program that were not categorically true.
They said many times that Americans who are happy with their current health insurance can keep it. This is true for almost all the insured — almost, but not quite. Of the 19 million people in the individual-insurance marketplace, estimates are that at least half will not be able to keep their policies because they do not meet the Affordable Care Act's standards.
There are good reasons why. Many of these policies offer little coverage and impose substantial out-of-pocket costs that discourage regular doctor visits. The Affordable Care Act exchanges and subsidies will offer many people better insurance at a lower cost.
Still, it was careless, at best, for Obama to make that unqualified keep-your-insurance promise — and make it so many times — without explaining the fine print. So now, they not only has to convince people that the Web site will eventually work, they also must counter their opponents' allegations that they were less than honest about the true impact of their signature domestic accomplishment.
The word “debacle” does fit the rollout. But the policy itself is sound, and eventually all the noise will fade. The first weeks of Obamacare will be forgotten. The first months will become a footnote. The first years are what will matter.

Camping in the Denali Backcountry
A guest post by Terry Hammond from Drive and Hike.
I stare out of the window as a grizzly bear rears up to scratch itself on a tree. This is my first wild brown bear sighting and two things cross my mind; wow, that thing's huge and that song from the Jungle Book.
As the bus driver pulls over and shouts Stoney Creek, a combination of excitement, disbelief and apprehension floods over me. This is our stop.
As the shuttle bus heads out of sight, the first thing which hits us is the silence. We (my wife and I) are now firmly in Denali backcountry. Our home for the next 4 days.
No battle plan survives first contact
With no marked trails, routes or designated campsites you really are free to make your own adventure. We had decided to head north from the road along the gravel bank of Stoney Creek into unit 39, where we would be spending the night.
This plan lasted less than a minute.
As we waded into the alpine tundra, with all the grace of small children, we scared 2 caribou who bolted east, only to go back to grazing a mere 50 meters away from us. We decided to follow.
Following the caribou took us into the heart of the park and away from the road. After 20 minutes they got away from us and instead of backtracking we decided to check our maps and create a new route.
Denali backcountry is freedom like no other; our entire plan had fallen apart in mere seconds just because we saw something cute. We looked at each other and grinned, realizing that this was the adventure we'd been looking for.
Radial hiking
Given the weight of our packs, (you need to be entirely self sufficient for your duration in Denali backcountry), we decided to hike into one unit and camp there for the duration of our time. Due to dense bush river crossings and animal sightings you should anticipate to cover 1 mile an hour with packs on.
By radial hiking you greatly increase the distance you can cover. We chose this option so we would be able to explore unencumbered and really soak up the wilderness all around us.
However, as always in Denali backcountry, this is your experience. If you want to see different sections of the park you can thru-hike or use the camper bus to explore different sections.
Solitude
This gigantic national park (bigger than New Hampshire) is split into 87 units, with 41 of them having a camping quota. Each unit varies in size, shape and terrain; they are built from boundaries such as rivers, ridge lines or the road.
Our little slice of paradise was one of those where only 4 people were allowed to spend the night. If the other 2 spaces were taken, we never saw them. We were kept company instead by the mountains, stars and the Northern Lights.
Summary
Denali backcountry is untouched but accessible wilderness. Nowhere else in the world do hikers have the same level of flexibility to shape their own adventure. Denali really is a must-do for anyone who loves the outdoors.

Hillary Clinton has outlined their economic policies, expressing worry over companies like Uber and other growing companies that rely on contract workers. They may be the Democratic front-runner, but they characterize the on-demand economy as committing wage theft. It is a serious accusation, with early reports suggesting they lean toward making workers employees so the government can protect them.
Mrs. Clinton has called for higher wages, pay equality, and other labor measures to help the middle class. Although some observers have called their attack on the on-demand economy a gaffe, it is not yet clear how the average American will react to their move. What is clear is that some candidates are hoping Mrs. Clinton's old-fashioned tax and spend rhetoric will hurt them Republican Sen. Rand Paul quickly blasted the former Secretary of State on Twitter over their questioning the economic model of the "gig" economy.
Sen. Paul noted that Mrs. Clinton does not need Uber herself, given their Secret Service detail and their admission that they haven't driven their own car since 1996! Of course, Uber, Lyft and scores of other companies can get in plenty of trouble over worker status issues without any help from Mrs. Clinton. The granddaddy of these 'problem' companies is Uber, which faces multiple suits from injured parties.
Then there are the suits from drivers themselves claiming they really work for Uber as employees. A panoply of taxes, fringes and liabilities are at stake. The recent ruling by California's Labor Commission that one Uber driver is an employee could be the shot heard round the world. Of course, Uber has appealed and has said it did not exert any control over the driver.
But California's Labor Commission said Uber is “involved in every aspect of the operation,” from vetting drivers and their vehicles to setting rates for trip fares. The Commission said Uber controls the tools driver use, monitors their approval ratings and terminates their access to the system if their ratings fall below 4.6 stars. And Florida is active too, where a state agency also ruled that Uber drivers are employees. A common formula considers such basics as:
The employer's control over the worker;
The worker's opportunity for profit or loss;
The worker's investment in facilities;
The worker's skill set; and
The duration of the relationship.
Uber promises good open-ended pay, flexible hours, even discounts on vehicles. But employee status? No way. Health and dental coverage? Tax withholding? Nope. The battle over the independent contractor versus employee designation has been underway for decades, and extends beyond ride-sharing companies. It's been a long-running issue at FedEx, which operates with a similar contractor setup with its ground delivery drivers. That's brought class-action lawsuits, and efforts to change state laws to put liabilities on the companies.
Uber and Lyft now face similar suits. Uber's latest $1.2 billion in financing and more than $40 billion valuation make it a valuation darling, but the tax and legal exposure of the company may be growing along with its valuation. Apart from taxes, benefits, workers' comp and unemployment, there is potential accident liability. When a driver has an accident that injures a passenger or third party, there is recourse to the drivers and their insurance.
But a serious or fatal accident can involve millions, far exceeding driver insurance policies. Uber is a clear target, unless the Communications Decency Act of 1996 prevents liability. But it is not far-fetched to imagine verdicts for injured plaintiffs, no matter how the legal niceties are observed. With taxi companies and in many other industries, the law has been sorting out similar issues for decades. The contracts and the actual course of conduct of the parties are likely to count.
Independent contractor vs. employee characterization questions span medical malpractice cases, tax disputes, worker compensation and unemployment matters and more. Even employment discrimination and sexual harassment cases. As many tax, employment, insurance and labor disputes reveal, workers labeled as independent contractors may be employees. Arrangements can be genuine or can be independent in name only, with no chance of standing up against the IRS, other agencies or the courts.
The IRS and state taxing agencies could benefit nicely by getting tax withholding money from Uber on pay to the drivers. And while it is by no means certain that the IRS and state tax agencies will try, it is not certain they will not. With Uber's vast valuation, expect more lawsuits. As with franchises, Uber may test the legal limits.
Workers may be labeled as “independent contractors,” but labels aren't enough. Uber has roiled the marketplace. But taxing and employment agencies that stand to make money off employees and not off independent contractors are likely to be watching. So, apparently, is Hillary Clinton.

By Siraj Wahab,
Mina: Among the 19,000 British pilgrims performing Haj this year was British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Simon Paul Collis and their wife Huda Mujarkech.
It was known to some diplomats and journalists that they had embraced Islam but there had been no official word.
The confirmation came on Tuesday in the form of a tweet from Saudi writer and academic Fawziah Al-Bakr (@fawziah1).
They posted two photos of Ambassador Collis and their wife in which they were wearing ihram.
The ambassador replied to the post by thanking Al-Bakr via their official Twitter handle (@HMASimonCollis). The ambassador's wife (@HudaMCollis) retweeted Al-Bakr's post.
Though Collis refused media requests for interviews on Wednesday, they said: “I have converted to Islam after being in Muslim societies for 30 years, and right before getting married to Huda.”
Collis has served as British ambassador to Saudi Arabia since January last year when Sir John Jenkins retired from the diplomatic service. The photos went viral on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, sending social media into overdrive.
Among the first who congratulated the ambassador and their wife was Princess Basmah bint Saud (@PrincessBasmah).
“Special congratulations to the ambassador and their wife,” wrote Princess Basmah.
“Thank you, Princess Basmah,” replied the ambassador.
British pilgrims were pleasantly surprised by the news.
“I would like to congratulate the ambassador on the historic occasion of their completion of Haj,” said Rashid Mogradia, CEO of the Council of British Hajis (CBHUK). “He is one of many thousands of British pilgrims to perform the journey of faith and we look forward to them sharing their experience and inspiring us all,” Mogradia added.
At a time when there is so much adverse publicity against Islam and Muslims, especially in the West, the ambassador's embrace of Islam was seen by the faithful as a vindication of the religion's universal appeal.
Collis speaks fluent Arabic. They joined the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1978 and, after studying Arabic, has served mainly in the Arab world.
A father of five children, their first posting was to Bahrain as second secretary (1981-1984). They served as British ambassador to Iraq (2012-2014), Syria (2007-2012) and Qatar (2005-2007). They were the British consul-general in Dubai (2000-2004) and in Basra (2004-2005). They also served in New Delhi as first secretary from 1991 to 1994.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Ain Issa is back in Kurdish fighters' control, two days after it reportedly fell to IS
Kurdish-led fighters say they have reclaimed a town from Islamic State close to the group's northern Syrian stronghold of Raqqa.
IS fighters reportedly seized the town of Ain Issa on Monday, but a statement by the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) said they had now taken it back.
They were supported by a female brigade, the YPJ and, the AFP agency said, by US airstrikes.
The town, only 50km (30 miles) north of Raqqa, is of strategic importance.
It is at an intersection of the main roads from Raqqa to other areas IS controls in Aleppo province, to the west, and Hassakeh province, to the east.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also confirmed Ain Issa was back in Kurdish fighters' hands.
In recent weeks, IS has launched several deadly counter-attacks against the Kurds.
The jihadist group had until then suffered a series of defeats in areas along the Turkish border since being forced to withdraw from the town of Kobane in January.
.- A gathering of researchers and scientists convened in Rome to discuss some of the greatest threats to humanity, identifying the tendency to view persons as less than human as a key factor.
“Human beings no longer are looked upon as persons, but as sources of raw material to help those who are the rich and the powerful,” said Dr. Jonathan Haas, president of the Pontifical Academy for Life.
The academy – which works to address “issues in law, in culture, in medicine, in bioethics” – met recently for their annual meeting, Haas told CNA Sept. 27.
Established by Bl. John Paul II, the group aims to promote and defend of human life, especially in the field of bioethics as it regards Christian morality.
“It's really a profound commitment to defend the dignity of the human person from the first moment of their conception,” they said.
Throughout their time in the field, Dr. Haas has observed that the most pressing life issue of modern times is “not individual specific issues, such as abortion or embryonic stem cell research, or euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.”
“It seems to me that the most pressing, broad issue is the de-humanization, the de-personalization of the human person.”
The academy's president observed the increasing culture-wide epidemic of the weak and the poor being treated as “sources of assistance for those who are…more powerful,” as a driving force behind the lack of respect for human dignity.
Citing the black market sale of organs and the freezing of embryos for research as examples, they emphasized that “it's the rich and the powerful really taking advantage of the weak and the vulnerable for their own benefit.”
Given the extent of the degradation of human dignity, Dr. Haas explained the approach of the pontifical group, emphasizing that “we are an academy.”
This implies, they said, that they seek individuals who are themselves “from the academy; from universities, from institutes of advanced studies, people with backgrounds in law, medicine, philosophy, theology, to address these common threats to human dignity.”
Focusing on the organization's acute expertise in varying fields, they explained that their aim is to discuss current life issues from different angles, but also from a “very high-level academic perspective,” because “those are the people who are formulating and implementing public policy around the world.”
“It's individuals who have expertise in the background, in the field of the natural sciences, the sacred sciences, philosophy, law, who are posing the threats, so we have to come back at these threats from these similar disciplines.”
The eight members of the board of directors for the academy had a private audience with the Holy Father on Sept. 27, in which the Pope lauded them for their work, but also stressed the challenges that they face.
In reference to the encounter, Dr. Haas said “it was wonderful, it was beautiful. Their words were beautiful.”
“He told us that we were going to have to struggle against the current. Everything you do, they said, is against the current, and it will be for the rest of your lives.”
Dr. Haas noted that the Pope urged them to keep in mind that “every step that you take forward in the protection of life, the other side, the culture of death, are taking steps forward as well.”
One of the qualities which stood out specifically to the academy president “was their gravity.”
“You see pictures of them all the time, and he's grinning, he's smiling. But they were very somber, and they looked down, and told us we were going to have to anticipate a lifetime of struggle in addressing these issues.”
Having the “support and approbation of the Vicar of Christ, the Successor to St. Peter,” who is “the highest moral authority on the planet,” the Academy president said, was a “significant encouragement” to them in their work.
On a personal note, Dr. Haas shared that during the audience, they took out a photo of their nine children and twenty-four grandchildren, which they showed to the Pope, who placed their hand over the picture to give the family their official blessing.
Lisa Fierstein.
In advance of Andrew Puzder's Labor secretary confirmation hearing on Thursday, Politico has obtained the much-discussed clip of the fast-food business CEO's ex-wife Lisa Fierstein discussing allegations of domestic abuse on Oprah.
The clip, which is from a 1990 Oprah special on “High-Class Battered Women,” was turned over by the Oprah Winfrey Network to the senate committee, and members of both parties have been assessing the tape in private. Democratic senator Patty Murray said they were “deeply troubled” by the tape. Until now, the network would not release the clip to the press.
Fierstein appeared on Oprah in a wig and sunglasses and went by the name Ann as they alleged that Puzder told them they would “pay for this” and that they “vowed revenge” against them for making their spousal-abuse allegations public. “Remember,” they say in the clip, “my husband was a public figure.”
Puzder and Fierstein divorced in 1987. Eight months following their divorce, they retracted their allegations of abuse and said often that they only claimed abuse for leverage in the divorce. Though Puzder and Fierstein's divorce documents had been sealed, a lawsuit filed by the Campaign for Accountability could result in the files being unsealed before tomorrow's confirmation hearing, Politico reports.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - Firefighters struggled on Wednesday to beat back a wildfire raging at the edge of Colorado Springs that doubled in size overnight, forced more than 32,000 people from their homes and was nipping at the edges of the U.S. Air Force Academy.
The blaze, fanned by hot winds, has charred a number of homes on the wooded edges of the city and was prompting fresh evacuations on Wednesday.
President Barack Obama plans to travel to the area on Friday to view the damage. But in the chaos of the fire's advance, officials could not say exactly how many homes were lost or how many more people might join the ranks of the displaced.
Colorado Springs Fire Chief Rich Brown called the firestorm threatening their city - in a metropolitan area of more than 650,000 people - “a monster” and said at this point flames were “not even remotely close to being contained.”
The fire, which has charred 15,517 acres in the shadow of the famed Pikes Peak mountaintop, was not as intense early on Wednesday as the day before, but would likely build up again as the temperature rises during the day, fire information officer Rob Deyerberg said.
The number of evacuees stood at 32,000 on Tuesday night, before some residents in Woodland Park, population 7,600, and surrounding areas were also told to leave their homes, Deyerberg said. They could not provide a total number of evacuees.
“The evacuation area is expanding as a precaution,” they said.

The blaze left an orange hue over Colorado Springs and the smell of smoke permeated the air. A spot fire hit on a vacant, southwest corner of the grounds of the Air Force Academy, which continues to operate but is closed to visitors, officials said.
Colorado wildfires have killed four people this year, but no serious injuries from the Waldo Fire were reported on Wednesday.
“This is the worst fire season in the history of Colorado,” Governor John Hickenlooper told a news conference on Tuesday, after they flew into Colorado Springs to tour the fire zone.
The Air Force Academy said the evacuation zone included two communities of single-family homes on its grounds housing around 2,100 civilian and military personnel and their families.
Despite the blaze, the academy will welcome a class of over 1,000 new cadets on Thursday, they said.
Over half of the federal government's firefighting resources are deployed in Colorado, the White House said.

At a gas station in Colorado Springs, Andrew Heintzelman, 34, said they had been on the roof of their home in the nearby community of Mountain Shadows on Tuesday trying to keep the flames at bay but had since been forced to flee.
“I was spraying the hose on the shingles and the cops came through the neighborhood and told me to get out now,” said Heintzelman, 34, who lives with their mother.
Thunderstorms in the area were expected to hurt firefighting efforts by causing erratic winds, which could shift from one direction to the next, fire officials said.
“All that kind of squirrelly behavior makes it really unsafe for anyone to be in or around the fire,” fire information officer Anne Rys-Sikora said.
Household pets in the area were also forced into shelter due to the approaching flames. The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region in recent days has taken in 252 animals, most of them dogs and cats but with everything from rats to a turtle in the mix, said Erica Meyer, a spokesperson for the group.
Many horses were taken to the Norris Penrose Event Center in Colorado Springs, said Brenda Vawter, who works at the Colorado Equine Veterinary Services clinic.
Wildfires also were burning in other parts of Colorado - where the High Park fire has consumed 87,250 acres but was 65 percent contained - and in Utah and Montana on Wednesday.
A wildfire in Montana that has scorched 19,000 acres in the eastern part of the state has forced 600 residents to leave their homes, said Kent Atwood, a state hazard mitigation officer. An unknown number of houses were destroyed in Montana.

In Utah, authorities found a body in the ashes of the fast-moving Wood Hollow Fire about 100 miles south of Salt Lake City on Tuesday, marking the first fatality in a blaze that has scorched more than 46,190 acres of rolling hills covered by parched cheatgrass and sagebrush.
Colorado accounts for several of the 29 large active wildfires being fought across the country. The bulk of them were in seven western states - Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona and California - according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
Although federal authorities say the fire season got off to an early start in parts of the northern Rockies, the number of fires and acreage burned nationwide is still below the 10-year average for this time of year, according to fire agency records.
In an effort to continue to provide enhanced safety to Tigers fans, the Tigers have implemented security measures at Comerica Park.
Here's what you need to know:
Upon entry to the ballpark, fans will have their bags searched and will need to pass through a walk through metal detector.
Guests will need to empty their pockets of keys, mobile phones and other items before walking through the metal detector. Guests can opt out of the walk thru metal detector screening, but they will be subject to hand held metal detector screening or alternative screening procedures.
It is suggested guests minimize the amount of items they bring to the ballpark.
There will be no access to the ballpark from the Beer Hall or the Labatt Blue Light Jungle outside doors.
No knives or weapons of any kind.
Fans are asked to arrive a bit earlier with security measures being implemented. If you have any questions, please contact Comerica Park Security:

Dartmouth Looks Within: College Takes Break After Student Protest Uproar
Hanover — The last time Dartmouth College canceled classes for non-weather-related purposes was in 1986, after the destruction of the anti-Apartheid “shanty town” on the green.
Yesterday, it was social unrest once again that led college administrators to call on students to take a time-out.
“Lots of people have been asking me why, why today,” interim President Carol Folt said during the midday community gathering in front of Dartmouth Hall. “It's because we believe that the level of emotion — what had become a pressure cooker — was very close to exploding. We believed our community had hit a tipping point where festering wounds and years of calls for help needed to be addressed without further delay.”
Last Friday, a group of 15 students interrupted a show performance that was part of Dimensions, a multi-day recruiting event that is meant to entice prospective students who are deciding between schools. The protest was staged to draw attention to what the students said are instances of homophobia, sexual assault and racism that have occurred on campus.
In the hours after the protest, students began posting comments on a private online message board not run by the college where students can post anonymously. Some of the posts threatened the physical safety of the protesters.
Administrators heeded to the protesters request to cancel classes and instead ordered a day of reflection.
It was the vitriolic response to the protesters that convinced officials to cancel classes. Turnout included about 1,500 people who gathered on the front lawn of Dartmouth Hall to hear Folt and others speak. About 2,450 turned out for a complimentary lunch.
The first event for students yesterday was a 10 a.m. speech by a diversity educator at Dartmouth Hall. As students filed in to hear the speaker, Junior Roger Lott and sophomore Jon Miller held up signs protesting the original protesters and the administration's decision to cancel classes.
Lott held up a sign that read, “Dartmouth is a safe place. Stop scaring the (prospective students). I paid for class. Where is it?”
One student walking into Dartmouth Hall stopped to read Lott's sign and then snapped at him, saying they know that students on campus make homophobic slurs because she's heard them.
Miller said they chose to make signs because they think the protesters should be punished for “forcibly entering” the Dimensions show, but instead the administration was thanking them in emails for bringing their concerns forward.
“I think the administration is panicking because the protesters are accusing them of not doing enough,” Miller said.
Miller also said he's disappointed that the administration has not taken action to reprimand the protesters for breaking the college's standards of conduct by disrupting a college function.
Dean of the College Charlotte Johnson said in an interview yesterday that the college is investigating complaints from all sides and will follow its process and policies for handling disciplinary cases. They said any disciplinary action would be meted out privately.
“It would be irresponsible for us to publicly condemn the protesters or any group of students that violate policies,” Johnson said.
Yesterday afternoon, more than 800 students attended teach-ins, where students and faculty broke up into small groups around the campus to talk about the college's social climate.
“There will be strong partnerships that will be emerging in the coming weeks,” Folt said. “People want to continue talking.”
While there was no shortage of shock and disappointment expressed over some of the comments directed over the weekend at the protesters, participants had a difficult time quantifying the effectiveness of yesterday's activities.
Karenina Rojas, a senior and one of the original Dimension protesters, said they thought the day was especially effective for those who have felt marginalized because it gave them an opportunity to talk in small groups with their peers.
They described Dartmouth students as falling into three categories: the students who have been marginalized; those who have not been marginalized and don't care about those who have seen discrimination; and then there are those in the middle, who are happy with their Dartmouth experience but want to understand the perspective of those who have been hurt.
The students in the middle are the ones who showed up yesterday, Rojas said.
But they said this one day of reflection is not enough.
“Reflection needs to happen every day at Dartmouth for it to be enough,” Rojas said. “There also needs to be a structural change. It's not enough for people to be nice.”
In an interview yesterday afternoon, Johnson and Folt talked in generalities about what was accomplished by cancelling classes. Johnson spoke of a stronger “coalition” made of students, faculty and staff overcoming their differences and building a community based on inclusiveness and respect.
There are a few items of change that students can expect to see immediately, Folt said, such as more dinners where students and faculty will be invited to attend to discuss campus issues. Faculty and students have also begun talking about how they can improve the social interactions of the incoming freshmen at fall orientation.
Bored at Baker, the online message board that drew the attention of college officials, was down yesterday. A posting on the main page said, “I do want to make it clear that taking the site offline has nothing to do with the current dialog on any b@ site and has everything to do with server health.”
Comments on the Bored at Baker site in recent days included:
■ “Just saw the pictures of the protesters. Don't think they have anything to worry about when it comes to being raped.”
■ “The protesters have shown us a perfect way to avoid sexual assault, get hideously ugly and make the whole campus hate you!”
■ “It's official, I'm going to start referring to these protestors as terrorists.”
As faculty members held their own meeting yesterday morning, a group of 18 students stepped out of the Black Family Visual Arts Center holding white signs with threatening and discriminating comments from Bored at Baker. The students walked past the Hopkins Center in silence and crossed the street in front of the Hanover Inn, before doing a lap around the green.
The messages on the white signs are the reason why the administration called for a day of reflection.
“I think it's important to recognize that it was technically done by the president, because she's the only person with the power to do it, but I think it is clear that it was forced by the student activists,” history professor Russell Rickford said at midday.
Yesterday's 70 degree temperatures brought students out of their apartments and dorms and onto the green. Many played frisbee, volleyball or sat in the grass on blankets, while others were voluntarily inside at the teach-ins.
Elsewhere, fraternity members sat in front of their houses in lawn chairs while music blasted, while across the street two men played cornhole.
Economics professor Bruce Sacerdote stood in front of the roughly 1,500 students on the front lawn of Dartmouth Hall and said they were shocked when they saw a list of comments from Bored at Baker.
“I was floored that there was a fundamental civil rights issue that still needed to be addressed,” Sacerdote said to the crowd.
Just because it appears that students talk about the issues in class or that the faculty doesn't pass resolutions doesn't make hate speech acceptable, Sacerdote said.
“Nobody is OK with it,” Sacerdote said. “There is absolutely no one, other than perhaps five or six whack-job-wing-nut perpetrators that is OK with it. And so we all need to do a better job.”
But others have seen this kind of hatred on campus before. Rickford, the history professor, said that while they were shocked by how hurtful and wrong the comments were, they said they aren't shocked that they were made.
“It is a systemic problem,” Rickford said. “It's part of the culture here. We have a rape culture, not just at Dartmouth. We have a rape culture around the world.”
History professor Annelise Orleck said students are sometimes raped or attacked and then later find their attacker in their classroom.
“We've all had students in our office talking about this,” Orleck said. “I'm not shocked. Sadly, in my 23 years here I've seen too much of this.”
But they said they think the discussions between students and faculty is breaking down the hierarchy. Also, the protesters were feeling so unsafe that it was important to talk about this, they said.
“These guys were brave enough to make it visible,” Orleck said. “And so now we are all talking about it.”

A Manhattan landlord is trying to evict a tenant for displaying two Confederate flags in the windows of their East Village apartment.
The court papers argue that tenant Will Green, who lives in a rent-regulated $1,141 apartment on East Eighth Street, “contractually gave up any free speech rights by their execution of the lease agreement, which bans objectionable conduct.
“The conduct of the defendant in the wake of the recent activities in Charlottesville, Va., the president's statements related to the same and public concerns make the defendant's actions unreasonable in character,” argues building owner Charles Yassky in the new Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit.
“This conduct is a prohibited, anti-social and intentional act that has no valid societal purpose and is not protected by any legal theory,” Yassky says in the suit.
The building owner claims that Green's flags — which they have illuminated at night with a spotlight from their fifth-floor unit — have created “a clear and present danger to the building, its residents and the community at large.”

Police have been patrolling the area for the past several days after protesters rallied outside the building and someone threw a rock through a window, according to the suit.
Yassky, a developer who owns residential and commercial real estate around the city and shopping malls around the country, has covered Green's windows with tarps to try to tamp down the unrest.
“The building and its residents have expressed constant fear of physical attack and for their physical safety and well being,” the landlord says in court papers.
They attached emails from five tenants attesting to their concerns.
“I do not feel safe sleeping tonight,” one resident wrote.
Green's two windows face the Lillian Wald Public Housing complex, “a multi-racial, diverse housing community,” Yassky notes in the suit.
In an Aug. 19 email attached to court papers, Green says they are in the mountains without cellphone service to get some “sun and to see the eclipse.”
“I've had those flags up for over a year. I find all the alleged commotion while i'm on vacation a little suspicious. I'll be back in the city on Tuesday, you can update me then. Whatever the drama, ‘this too shall pas.' (like the eclipse),” Green wrote.
Yassky has threatened to post Green's name, phone number and photo outside the building if they don't remove the flags.
Green did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the eviction suit.
The tenant has a “history of unpredictable behavior,” according to court papers, which say they once threw a television down the stairs, has played offensive music, displayed German Cross flags and even attempted suicide by jumping from a window before they were stopped by EMS.
The suit cites a 2007 Tennessee case in which a judge upheld a school's policy prohibiting Confederate flag displays because of racial tensions.

All-Star Western has been one of the most unique releases from DC Comics in the New 52. All-Star Western mainly follows the adventures of bounty Hunter Jonah Hex in the 1880's. Hex's adventures take them many places, including to Gotham City. The book also features a colorful cast of supporting characters and villains. Unfortunately, sales have not been stellar for the book despite the great writing of Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti. Personally, I would chalk it up to the stigma that automatically turns people off a western comic coupled with a character that may be too mature for some readers. However, don't let the word western in the title dissuade you from reading this.
All-Star Western is an interesting book because of how different it is. Jonah Hex doesn't have the DC superhero sense of morality as they shoot and kills people. The book is only made better with the addition of Amadeus Arkham, better known to some readers from the Arkham video games or as the future creator of Arkham Asylum. The two men occasionally team up (much to Hex's chargin) to solve crimes that will let Hex get more money and Amadeus more research. It's hilarious to watch Gray and Palmiotti turn what can quickly turn into a tired trope (reluctant partners) into something wonderful.
The first arc finds Hex and Amadeus attempting to solve the case of the Gotham Butcher (not unlike Jack the Ripper) but end up finding a great deal more than they bargain for. The second issue of the book settles any sort of wouldbe belief that Hex is some sort of hero who's not afraid to kill in a wonderful two page spread. Hex is also a man who is not afraid to use their fists, Arkham on the other hand might be a man afraid of their own shadow. This is also a good time to mention that the art by Moritat is nothing short of fantastic. Gray and Palmiotti do a great job of also showing that Hex isn't completely heartless, but instead is just guided by a moral code that one would be wise not to cross. The second arc finds Hex and Amadeus in New Orleans, important to note since the book doesn't just remain only in Gotham. At one point, Hex also tangles with the nefarious Court of Owls for a few issues, albeit somewhat indirectly.
The fact that the book takes place in the 1880's allows it the unique opportunity of looking at Gotham City with a cast of characters that readers are unfamiliar but know will play a pivotal role in the future. It also allows for villains such as Doctor Jekyll, who is featured in an arc. One of the other wonderful things about All-Star Western is how (mostly) self-contained it is. Hex (due to time and space limitations) is able to avoid interacting with the usual cast of superheroes and instead can team up with more original characters. The book isn't all blood and murder either. Gray and Palmiotti do a wonderful job of making the book often quite hilarious as well.
One of the best things about All-Star Western is that there is a backup featuring different characters of the western variety also written by Gray and Palmiotti. The backup features stories with characters such as El Diablo, The Barbary Ghost, Nighthawk & Cinnamon, Bat Lash, Terrence 13, Tomahawk, and Storm Watch. The backups all feature different original stories that take tones, but you can bet that they're going to include a great deal of packed action. They certainly make the extra dollar per issue worth it.
The current arc (starting in issue 19) finds Hex finally having the ability to leave Gotham City. Although for the moment not with Amadeus Arkham (having thrown them out of a train when leaving Gotham) but instead meeting the one and only time traveling Booster Gold. Hex and Booster Gold teaming up is comedy gold, especially due to the general incompetence of Booster. Due to circumstances however, Jonah Hex finds themselves in the future in issue 21. One can imagine that Hex (who doesn't like change) isn't exactly adapting well to the new change in scenery. Things don't go exactly take a change for the better when Hex finds themselves in a fight with Batwing (another character written by Gray and Palmiotti) and ultimately finds themselves in a nice padded cell within Arkham at the end of the issue.
Issue 22 of All-Star Western is being released this week. The biggest reason why I recommend this book is because of how different it is, as previously mentioned. This isn't a book that you would find elsewhere on your local comicbook shelves, and that's a good thing. All-Star Western offers more diversity in storytelling for comics, especially for the New 52 after the cancellation of Demon Knights. Overall, All-Star Western is a funny book with a great deal of action but at the same time some excellent storytelling.

Bernie Sanders got their second major national union endorsement this week. The American Postal Workers Union announced it was backing the Vermont senator in their Democratic presidential campaign. The APWU represents more than 200,000 current and retired postal workers, and joins National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders in August.
"Sen. Bernie Sanders stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country," APWU President Mark Dimondstein said in a statement. "He doesn't just talk the talk. They walk the walk." "He is a fierce advocate of postal reform to address the cause of the USPS financial crisis and an outspoken opponent of USPS policy that degrades mail service," Dimondstein added, saying Sanders had fought the closure of post offices.
The APWU endorsement makes particular sense since Sanders has been a strong advocate for expanding the Postal Service's offerings to include things like banking, strengthening rather than weakening the institution while offering needed services for unbanked and underbanked Americans.
Sanders, however, continues to lag behind Hillary Clinton in union endorsements. Clinton has the endorsements of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the National Education Association (NEA); the American Federation of Teachers (AFT); the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association (OPCMIA); the Union of Painters & Allied Trades (IUPAT); United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (UBC); United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW); the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC); and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (UA).
There was the homeless man in a miniskirt and fishnet stockings who stuffed oranges in their brassiere and wielded a plunger – a reminder that Orange County was going down the drain.
There was the eccentric forensic accountant who pushed recalls against officials who had already agreed to leave office, hordes of enraged anti-tax activists who shouted down county supervisors, “Killer Bees” – cities like Buena Park, Santa Barbara, Claremont and Montebello – who refused to toe the line.
Then there was Robert “Bob” Citron himself, self-proclaimed “master of the ship at the helm” and former Orange County treasurer, who had a strong affinity for Navajo jewelry, a collection of 300 ties that they rarely wore, authored 14-page odes to Chrysler automobiles, and consulted psychics and a $4.50-star chart as they managed a highly-leveraged investment pool with billions of dollars belonging to schools, cities and the county itself.
Citron bet wrong on interest rates. There was a run on the bank. Their investment pool lost $1.64 billion. And county officials fled into federal bankruptcy court.
There have been other spectacular municipal bankruptcies, but none can claim the color of Orange County's debacle, which was the largest ever when it was declared in 1994. That one of America's wealthiest counties could go bust shocked the nation, and officials vowed to repay the public agencies that had lost money seeking Citron's beefy returns. The county issued $1 billion in bonds to raise the cash to make that happen, and on Saturday, July 1 – 22 years and $1.5 billion later – Orange County's final payment on that bankruptcy bond debt was delivered to bondholders.
Repayments averaged $68 million a year – money that could have funded street improvements, libraries, health care and myriad other public services. Its impact is a ghostly one, measured in shadows of what might have been.
On the upside, a great many lessons were learned that have benefited public agencies nationwide. Public accounting is far more transparent. Leverage – taking billions of public dollars, persuading elected officials to borrow against it, and then persuading Wall Street to lend money on the loaned money, thus generating enormous earnings to fund government operations – is no longer allowed. Many exotic investments are verboten for public treasuries. And public treasurers must “mark to market” – publicly disclose what their investments are worth now, as opposed to what they'll be worth months or years down the road when they mature.
If Citron had been required to do any of those things, Orange County's story may have ended much differently.
In another only-in-Orange County twist, there were criminal charges attendant to the bankruptcy, but not because anyone was lining their own pockets. Citron was actually lining the county's pockets, trying to provide more and more money for public services.
Shortly before implosion, Citron had managed to leverage $7.6 billion in public funds into a $20.6 billion investment pool. Earnings had grown so astronomically high that their office was skimming money off the top – and reporting lower-than-actual returns to cities, schools and special districts – so as not to alarm them and trigger a run on the bank.
The skimmed money – $89 million – went into county coffers, and false accounting was the source of the criminal charges to which Citron ultimately pleaded guilty.
Citron died in 2013, long maintaining that the county had other options and never should have declared bankruptcy to begin with.
The saga's impact on the day final bond payments are made prompted many to reflect.
“To me, the bankruptcy showed how disunited we are as a county,” said Fred Smoller, political science professor at Chapman University. “Citron did wrong, but O.C. voters wanted services they didn't want to pay for, so they gambled with the funds in the investment pool. When they got outrageously high returns they were hailed by the supervisors and others as a genius. But when things went South, they were called an incompetent fool.”
Citron bet that interest rates would fall; the Fed ratcheted them up. Some savvy cities and water districts saw the disaster coming and quietly began withdrawing funds.
“Unlike the bank run scene in ‘Its a Wonderful Life,' when Jimmy Stewart asks customers to put the community ahead of themselves so their civic-minded Savings and Loan could hang on, fund investors put self-interest over the county,” Smoller said. “Had we all hung in, ironically, the Orange County Investment Pool would have eventually recouped its loses when the Fed began lowering interest rates.”
If voters had approved Measure R – a half-cent sales tax to pay off bankruptcy debt that was soundly rejected – hundreds of millions in interest and fees would have been saved, Smoller said.
William Popejoy, the Newport Beach investment banker who volunteered to get the county's financial house back in order immediately after the debacle and supported the sales tax hike, tried to tell everyone that.
“We said, you'll pay one way or the other,” Popejoy said. “The money had to be repaid.”
Popejoy led the crippled county as it struggled to make ends meet in those early, chaotic days, when public meetings were full of rancor and blame and dragged on for what seemed like days. They clashed with county supervisors who resented their unvarnished assessments of their abilities and motives, and was ousted after five months. But they balanced a decimated budget and set the ship back on course.
“People still come up to me and say thanks,” Popejoy said. “There were a whole bunch of volunteers who put in very long hours, and I was impressed by the quality of the county employees. Top notch people. I don't have any regrets. It's one of the things I'm most proud of in my life.”
John Moorlach was an upstart CPA running against Citron in 1994, warning of the coming doom. They were scolded by officials for hurting investors' confidence and dismissively dubbed “Chicken Little.” When their predictions came to pass, they were appointed Treasurer Tax Collector. Their license plate says, “SKY FELL.”
“The bankruptcy dramatically changed my life,” said Moorlach, who went on to become a county supervisor and is now a state senator. “I sort of feel like I lived in a movie. I was an officer of the county when those recovery bonds were issued, and I wondered if I'd live long enough to see them paid off. It was a great turn-around opportunity. A lot has changed since then, and the county is better for it. It's been nearly 23 years, and no one has been able to pull a stunt like this again. It's a good day.”
Others feel justice wasn't done.
“Just like the Wall Street meltdown starting in 2008, virtually no one (save house arrest for Citron) was held politically or legally responsible for what happened with the people's money during the O.C. bankruptcy,” said Mark Petracca, political science professor at UC Irvine. “It's pretty darn amazing and there is a very troubling ‘lesson' here for any public officials who wish to play fast and loose on the taxpayers' dime.”
While the bonds are finally paid off, there's still another $19.7 million that must be paid before all bankruptcy-related bills disappear. The “class b-13 claimants” get their final payment late next year.
And then what?
“Despite the checks and balances now, and a commitment to strategic planning, there is always the chance that institutional memory will fade as time goes by and as leadership changes,” said William Steiner, who was appointed to the Board of Supervisors the year before the fall. “The county has essentially fared well over the years despite the bankruptcy. Still, millions of dollars have been diverted from other important county departments and priorities.”
Steiner expects parks and recreation programs to get a significant bump in revenue now that the bonds are paid off.
Todd Spitzer was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1996, as the county was adjusting to the new normal. They went on to serve in the state Assembly, then was re-elected supervisor in 2012.
“The entire time the focus has been one of incredible belt-tightening and difficulty because of the huge whopping amount of dollars that were being paid to pay off the bankruptcy,” Spitzer said. “My biggest fear is that, as the bankruptcy gets more and more in the rear view mirror, supervisors are going to have lost perspective of what it means to operate under the guise of a very, very, very difficult financial situation.”
To UCI's Petracca, it ends not with a bang, but a whimper. They said few people – even those whose lives were dramatically impacted by cutbacks in social services spending – will recall anything about the bankruptcy.
“As it is said towards the end of ‘The Untouchables,' when Eliot Ness leans over Al Capone, ‘Here endeth the lesson,'” Petracca said.

Venerable quarterback Aaron Murray joined The Midday Show with Rick Kamla and John Michaels to discuss Georgia Bulldogs football and the college football in general.
During the interview Murray hits a number of topics:
They jokingly give Jake Fromm advice to spike the ball on the 10-yard line if he's ever on a 75-yard drive late to win a game. (0:15)
Murray breaks down Fromm's game. (0:40)
How much of a threat will Auburn QB Jarrett Stidham be to UGA on Saturday? (2:12)
What constitutes success for UGA in 2017? Is an SEC title good enough? (3:15)
Would the Dawgs still be No. 1 in the College Football Playoff and undefeated if Jacob Eason was still the starting quarterback. (4:21)
“I think so,” said Murray. “If you look at the way they've played this season they've played great defense, they've run the ball extremely well — which is something that's been surprising to me not because of our backs but because of our offensive line. And if you want to talk about a unit that has really done a complete 360 from last year, that unit has been amazing this entire year, running the football, protecting Fromm in the pocket.
“But the quarterback, Fromm has only had a couple of games where he's had to throw the ball over 20 times — I mean, Florida, 4 for 7. I think Eason, if you put Eason in there, we'd be 8-1, 9-0, easy right now. The quarterback hasn't been asked to have to do that much. I think the running game has been that strong, and I really like Eason. I think Eason is a great quarterback. I was looking forward to Year 2 from them to see that big stride because usually that's when you see the biggest stride as a quarterback from Year 1 to Year 2.
“But going back to Fromm… I think he's had a tremendous year, he's made plays when their number's been called — not only passing the ball but running the ball as well.”
A GEELONG wheel manufacturer that started out in a household garage and an old shearing shed has won a multimillion-dollar contract to supply the world's most advanced wheels for some of the fastest cars on the planet.
Carbon Revolution, now based in a brand-new $25 million facility inside the Deakin University campus, will supply Ford in Detroit with the world's first ever mass-produced lightweight carbon-fibre wheels for the limited edition high performance Mustang 350-R and Ford's modern Ferrari-fighter, the low-slung GT supercar.
Although the regular Ford Mustang is due on sale in Australia before the end of the year, unfortunately the particular models fitted with the carbon-fibre wheels will not be sold locally; they're for the US only for now.
Carbon Revolution is one of 63 suppliers that will make parts locally for foreign Ford factories after the Broadmeadows car assembly line and the Geelong engine plant shut in October 2016.
It means more than half of Ford Australia's existing suppliers will remain in business, securing the jobs of an estimated 1000 workers in the parts supply base, even after Ford's factory closures.
Carbon Revolution has doubled to 100 the number of employees in the past 10 months, and more than half previously worked in nearby factories for Ford and aluminium company Alcoa.
The wheel company is the first in the world to perfect the technology to make carbon-fibre wheels as strong as alloy wheels.
“No-one has been able to do what we've been able to do,” says the chief executive officer of Carbon Revolution, Jake Dingle. “Even the aerospace industry couldn't figure out a way to do it.”
Ford heard about the start-up company by chance two-and-a-half years ago, and then began torture testing the wheels, including hitting potholes at 100km/h to see if the wheels would shatter.
“A lot of people think they're going to turn to dust when they hit a pothole, but these wheels are stronger than alloy wheels,” says Jamal Hameedi, the global head of Ford Performance, who travelled from Detroit for the opening of the Geelong facility today.
“This shows Ford is prepared to go to the ends of the earth to get an advantage over our competitors,” they said. “Make no mistake, this is a step change in the automotive world.”
The wheels save a combined 30kg per car compared to one fitted with standard wheels; that might not sound like much but carmakers spend millions to trim a fraction of that, because weight is the enemy of speed and agility.
Ford and Carbon Revolution won't say how much the wheels cost, only saying they are “several times” dearer than regular wheels.
But as Carbon Revolution ramps up production — it hopes to make 50,000 wheels a year within two years — the cost may come down and Ford may fit them to more cars.
In one of their first public outings as the Federal Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Christopher Pyne said with the closure of Australia's car factories “our future is exactly in this kind of advanced manufacturing”.
“It's creating employment in the region at a time when it needs it most,” Mr Pyne said. “We need to move our economy from old manufacturing … to new (types of) manufacturing.”
Meanwhile Ford has committed to maintain a workforce of at least 1200 engineers and designers once its manufacturing plants shut down, which will eventually make Ford the single biggest automotive employer once Holden and Toyota also close their factories.
Holden will employ about 150 designers and 150 engineers to work on foreign cars, including some sold in Australia, while Toyota will also employ 150 engineers.

I could rip Todd Haley, and it wouldn't even be sport.
I could rip the Steelers' offensive coordinator for a display so sickly — 14 first downs, 195 yards — that it not only wrought a 16-9 loss to a terribly beatable Tennessee team Sunday at Heinz Field but also had fans fleeing for the exits.
Early in the fourth quarter!
Of the season opener!
I could rip Haley for a third-and-11 receiver screen to Emmanuel Sanders in which tight end David Paulson, who can't block, was sent out to block. Paulson whiffed, and Sanders was slammed for a 2-yard loss.
A loss!
I could rip Haley for having all halftime to script the following sequence to open the second half: Dump to LaRod Stephens-Howling, run by Stephens-Howling, incomplete dump to Stephens-Howling.
And the first two plays of the next series plowed little LaRod right into the heart of the Titans' stout line.
Five LaRods in a row!
They didn't get featured like that in Pitt vs. The Citadel!
I could even rip Haley for the sequence that led to the lone touchdown, of all things: Counting every tick close to the two-minute warning and having first-and-goal at the Tennessee 4, the Steelers tried a pass shy of the goal line. Incomplete. Then another pass shy of the goal line. Incomplete. Then another pass shy of the goal line. Tackled short.
It wasn't until Jerricho Cotchery was found just across the goal line that the Steelers scored with 1:26 left.
Imagine!
I could rip Haley from now till next Monday, time he'll no doubt invest in drawing up more gems for LaRod, bum knee and all, to beat the Bengals all by their lonesome.
But no, I won't do that.
I'll let Mike Tomlin do it.
The coach was asked if there had been confusion leading to Isaac Redman's opening-drive fumble into the Tennessee end zone that should have staked the Steelers a 9-0 lead, and Tomlin replied: “There was. We had a miscommunication in terms of the personnel group.”
Redman clarified: There were supposed to be two tailbacks on that play, Felix Jones the other. The aim is to keep the defense guessing which way the ball will go. But the Steelers' players noticed upon breaking huddle that fullback David Johnson was out there instead, and only a few seconds were left on the play clock. Redman instructed D.J. to line up behind them in the unfamiliar tailback slot.
No way D.J. was getting the ball, of course, and it was probably all the Titans could do no to bust out laughing. Redman said they were all “pointing at me.”
Setting aside that the fumble resulted from a high handoff by Ben Roethlisberger, how does that happen?
Well, since Tomlin called it a “miscommunication,” and it didn't occur on the field, that's the coordinator's job.
But wait. Tomlin wasn't done doing my job in ripping Haley.
Asked why the running game wasn't there after Maurkice Pouncey's injury — a whole 28 yards on 14 carries by the backs — the coach's answer was crushing in its candor: “We didn't execute. They did. They had a nice plan. Our plan could have been better under the circumstances. Obviously, we had intended on using Kelvin Beachum some at tight end. When they had to go to center, that changed. We didn't adjust well enough. I take responsibility for that.”
Fine, but responsibility for the “plan” that Tomlin cites is that of the coordinator.
So, um, wow.
Look, there was blame to go around, not least of which was cruel fate for cutting down Pouncey and Larry Foote to potentially season-ending injuries. Blame Kevin Colbert and Tomlin, too, for the still-inexplicable release of Jonathan Dwyer. Blame Tomlin for not having their team ready and for sitting Jarvis Jones on the series after they went all Jadeveon Clowney on Chris Johnson. Blame Sanders for flat-out not showing up. Blame Danny Smith's special teams for two more dumb flags.
And by all means, blame the offensive line in full throat.
But sorry, I can't get past that Haley had all summer to prepare for the Titans, including a kumbaya with their QB and a clarification of all terminology and other happy stuff, and this was the result?
A botched goal-line setup and an endless array of silly screens and sideline routes?
Roethlisberger blamed themselves — “Not good enough, point blank” — but their exasperation was visible on the field, and only they can say if that was for execution or the “plan.”
Tomlin's correct: The “plan” isn't good enough. Hasn't been good enough for a year and change now.
So who's still sticking up for the planner?
Under pressure to restart negotiations with the Palestinians, the Israeli government continues to expand settlements deeper into occupied territory, today announcing 380 new settlement units in occupied East Jerusalem.
The bulk of the expansion is in the northern Ramot neighborhood, 307 new homes, with another 73 in Har Homa, which is further to the south. The Har Homa construction is part of a massive 1,000+ unit expansion dating back to 2011.
Council members from opposition parties were critical of the move, saying it is making efforts to come to an agreement with the Palestinians impossible. Israel's ruling far-right parties insist they never intended to return any of metro East Jerusalem to the Palestinians anyhow.
Ramot has a population of 70,000, while Har Homa has a population of around 25,000. Since Israel annexed occupied East Jerusalem, they treat the settlements as part of the city, though it is not recognized internationally.

Environment Canada admits it was off its long-term forecast for Western Canada's winter.
In the fall, when the weather service was predicting what it would be like this winter, it said be prepared for temperatures colder than normal.
Instead, this has been one of the mildest winters on record. In southern Manitoba, temperatures have often been far warmer than normal for this time of year, causing problems for ice rinks, winter roads, ski hills and businesses that rely on the cold and snow.
"Boy, never have we been more wrong in the West as this year," said Dave Phillips, chief climatologist for Environment Canada.
"I mean, you know, to have just been normal would have been a real error," they added.
"But my gosh, when you come out of December and January to be the second-warmest on record, I mean, it really is embarrassing almost. I mean it truly, when you look at it, it's been sort of the non-winter."
In Winnipeg, the average daily high in December 2011 was –3.5 C. The normal is –9.7 C. Snowfall for the month was 5.2 cm, while the normal is 19.8 cm.
Despite a brief blast of frigid temperatures in mid-January, the average daily high this month was –6.0 C, compared to the normal of –12.7 C. The snowfall amount was 20.8 cm, compared to the normal of 23.1 cm.
There is a La Nina weather pattern present in the Pacific, which usually means colder than usual winters, said Phillips.
That's what Environment Canada used for its prediction.
Even at the start of December, the weather office was still suggesting British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the most western part of northern Ontario should expect below seasonal temperatures through December, January and February.
However, the Arctic air that usually moves south has been kept north thanks to a strong jet stream.
François Fillon Michel Spingler/AP Photo PARIS (Reuters) - Some 61 percent of voters have a negative opinion of French presidential election candidate Francois Fillon, according to an opinion poll carried out after the publication of allegations that they paid their wife for a fake job.
The Odoxa poll shows 38 percent have a good opinion of Fillon. That is a drop of 16 percentage points since a similar poll carried out in November, Odoxa pollsters said.
Satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported on Wednesday that Penelope Fillon had been paid some 600,000 euros ($641,640.00)for many years of employment as a parliamentary assistant to Fillon, then to their replacement as a lawmaker and also for work at a cultural journal.
Fillon denies any wrongdoing and has called the allegations "abject."
The poll was carried out online on Thursday among 1,012 people.
In my first few glances at SKOS eXtension for Labels, I didn't quite get it. Recently, though, while looking at a client's requirements document at TopQuadrant, when I saw that they wanted to attach metadata to individual terms, I started modeling this in my head and then I realized I didn't need to: SKOS-XL already had.
"Any problem in Computer Science can be solved by another level of indirection."
First, why can't you attach metadata to specific terms with the base SKOS standard? Because although SKOS is an ontology for managing controlled vocabularies (and taxonomies, and thesauri), the basic unit of what it manages is not a term, which is what taxonomy management software always managed before. This is a Good Thing, because it makes internationalized vocabularies much easier to manage. I can have a single concept with a German preferred label of "Spirituosen", a British English preferred label of "spirits", an American English preferred label of "liquor", and an American alternative label of "booze", and they all refer to the same concept. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's AGROVOC thesaurus is a good example of this practice, with dozens of preferred and alternate labels for some concepts.
SKOS's extensibility means that you can attach all the metadata you want to a particular concept, but not to one of the terms defined as labels for that concept. This is because, being labels, they're strings. (In spec talk, they're "lexical entities", which isn't quite the same thing, but close enough for our purposes.) SKOS is built on RDF, and in RDF triples strings can only be the objects of triples, not the subjects. So how can we assign metadata about the labels themselves, such as the name of the person who added a particular label, or the date it was last updated?
The Cambridge computer scientist David Wheeler, who in 1951 became the first person ever to complete a PhD in the field, once said "Any problem in Computer Science can be solved by adding another level of indirection". That's what SKOS-XL does: it defines variations on the SKOS skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel properties called skosxl:prefLabel and skosxl:altLabel (assuming, as always, that these prefixes have been properly declared). Instead of having strings as their values, these extension properties point to members of the skosxl:Label class. Members of this class have a skosxl:literalForm property to identify a string that serves as a label for the concept, and it can have all the additional properties you want.
The following shows some Turtle syntax for a SKOS-XL representation of the concept described above, with extra :lastEdited and :myCustomProperty properties adding metadata to some of the labels:
@prefix skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#> . @prefix skosxl: <http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos-xl#> . @prefix : <http://www.example.com/demo#> . @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> . @prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> . :concept234 rdf:type skos:Concept ; skosxl:prefLabel :label1 ; skosxl:prefLabel :label2 ; skosxl:prefLabel :label3 ; skosxl:altLabel :label4 . :label1 rdf:type skosxl:Label ; :lastEdited "2011-02-05T10:21:00"^^xsd:dateTime ; skosxl:literalForm "Spirituosen"@de . :label2 rdf:type skosxl:Label ; :lastEdited "2011-02-05T10:28:00"^^xsd:dateTime ; :myCustomProperty 2.71828 ; skosxl:literalForm "spirits"@en-GB . :label3 rdf:type skosxl:Label ; :lastEdited "2011-02-05T10:34:00"^^xsd:dateTime ; skosxl:literalForm "liquor"@en-US . :label4 rdf:type skosxl:Label ; :lastEdited "2011-02-05T10:42:00"^^xsd:dateTime ; :myCustomProperty 3.1415 ; skosxl:literalForm "booze"@en-US .
The general idea is pretty elegant, and having a standardized way to do it prevents me and others from developing our own variations that do the same thing. I'm glad I didn't take that model in my head too far.
How much use of SKOS-XL have people seen in the real world?

An international group of researchers has discovered that two regions in the genomes of Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are changing in response to the spread of a recently emerged infectious disease.
The Tasmanian devil is found throughout the island state of Tasmania, Australia, although fossil evidence suggests that it once occupied much of the Australian mainland.
It is the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world, reaching 2.6 feet (80 cm) in length and weighing up to 31 pounds (14 kg).
This animal was given the unflattering ‘devil' name by early settlers, perhaps after they heard the animal's otherworldly cries in the night.
Tasmanian devils are nocturnal and usually solitary. They occupy several different dens, changing dens every 1-3 days, and traveling a mean nightly distance of 5.6 miles (9 km). However, individuals have occasionally been observed to move up to 31 miles (50 km) in a single night.
They are considered to be generalist predators and specialized scavengers. They actively hunt prey up to about 44 pounds (20 kg) in size using a combination of ambush and short, moderate-speed pursuits.
Prey comprise primarily medium- to large-sized mammals, although they will eat large invertebrates such as bogong moths and the carcasses of any dead vertebrates, leading them to focus on areas where lambing, calving or wallaby shooting are in progress.
Tasmanian devils display significant aggression toward one another, which often involves biting on the face.
This sometimes transmits Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), a nearly 100% fatal and transmissible cancer first detected in northeastern Tasmania in 1996.
DFTD has swept across nearly the entire species' range, resulting in localized declines exceeding 90% and an overall species decline of more than 80% in less than twenty years.
Despite models that predicted extinction, populations of Tasmanian devils at long-diseased sites persist.
Washington State University's Prof. Andrew Storfer, an evolutionary geneticist who has studied DFTD for nearly a decade, teamed up with colleagues in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia to investigate whether there was a genetic component to some of the Tasmanian devils' survival.
The team mined a vast trove of Tasmanian devil DNA collected and stored before and after the outbreak of DFTD by study co-author Dr. Menna Jones and their research group at the University of Tasmania.
The frequency of genes in specific regions of the old DNA were compared to the frequency of genes in corresponding regions of DNA collected following DFTD emergence at three sites on Tasmania.
The scientists identified two small genomic regions in the DNA samples from all three sites that exhibited significant changes in response to the strong selection imposed by the disease.
Five of seven genes in the two regions were related to cancer or immune function in other mammals, suggesting that Tasmanian devils are indeed evolving resistance to DFTD.
The researchers are in the process of determining the specific functionality of the genomic regions identified in the study.
They are hopeful that disease free devils with the apparently DFTD resistant DNA can be bred to enhance the genetic diversity of an off-island captive insurance population in case devil reintroductions are needed in the future.
“Our study suggests hope for the survival of the Tasmanian devil in the face of this devastating disease,” Prof. Storfer said.
“Ultimately, it may also help direct future research addressing important questions about the evolution of cancer transmissibility and what causes remission and reoccurrence in cancer and other diseases.”
The team's findings were published this week in the journal Nature Communications.

Washington, D.C. (The Adobo Chronicles) – There are approximately 7.6 Million Americans living overseas, and if they were to become a separate state of the U.S., they would constitute the 13th largest population, next only to the state of Virginia.
That is exactly what Michele Bachmann (R-Minnesota) is proposing in a new bill they filed today in the House of Representatives.
Bachmann filed H.R. 707 creating the 51st state of the U.S. and is calling it the “At-Large State.” All Americans living abroad would automatically become voting citizens of the new state and they will be able to vote by absentee ballot for their representatives to Washington, D.C. Currently, expatriates don't have a voice in Congress, especially when it comes to taxation.
High taxes have become a hot button issue among American expatriates. The number of Americans giving up their citizenship mainly because of tax issues surged to 3,000 in 2013 – three times more than the previous year.(This is not to mention U.S.-based corporations moving their headquarters abroad to significantly reduce their tax liability).
Another point of contention among expatriates is a federal law called the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCO which compels foreign banks and other financial institutions to provide information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service about Americans holding accounts. It is meant to catch American expatriates who don't pay enough taxes, or not pay at all.
Bachmann's bill is brilliantly crafted. The senator had previously announced that they would not be seeking reelection to their Congressional seat in 2014. Sources say they plan to move to Istanbul after their current term expires. If their bill becomes law, they would automatically become a citizen of the 51st At-Large State and would be eligible to run for a seat in the House of Representatives or the Senate.
It would be the best of two worlds for Bachmann.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bernie Conatser has never seen business this good.
Bernie Conatser, owner of Virginia Arms Company, displays one of their rifles.
The owner of a gun shop in the Washington suburb of Manassas, Virginia, Conatser said sales have doubled or tripled since this time last year.
On Saturday, they said, they did as much business as they would normally do in a week.
"I have been in business for 12 years, and I was here for Y2K, September 11, Katrina," Conatser said, as a steady stream of customers browsed what remained of their stock. "And all of those were big events, and we did notice a spike in business, but nothing on the order of what we are seeing right now."
Weapons dealers in much of the United States are reporting sharply higher sales since Barack Obama won the presidency a week ago.
Buyers and sellers attribute the surge to worries that Obama and a Democratic-controlled Congress will move to restrict firearm ownership, despite the insistence of campaign aides that the president-elect supports gun rights and considers the issue a low priority. Watch shoppers snap up guns of all types »
According to FBI figures for the week of November 3 to 9, the bureau received more than 374,000 requests for background checks on gun purchasers -- a nearly 49 percent increase over the same period in 2007. Conatser said their store, Virginia Arms Company, has run out of some models -- such as the AR-15 rifle, the civilian version of the military's M-16 -- and is running low on others.
Such assault weapons are among the firearms that gun dealers and customers say they fear Obama will hit with new restrictions, or even take off the market.
Virginia gun owner Kyle Lewandowski said they were buying a .45-caliber pistol to "hedge my bets."
"Every election year, you have to worry about your rights being eroded a little bit at a time," they said. "I also knew, because of the Democrat majority and because of the election, everybody would have the same reaction I did," they added.
But Peter Hamm, a spokesperson for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, called the buying spree "goofy." They said widespread talk of banning guns is a "sales pitch."
"With the glacial speed that we make progress on sensible gun laws, savvy gun consumers should know better than to think they have to rush out and buy guns," Hamm said. Similar surges accompanied the election of Bill Clinton, the last Democratic president, they added.
Dealers in Colorado, Ohio, Connecticut and New Hampshire also reported seeing major increases.
"It's a fact that the liberal Democrats that now control all three branches of our government do not like guns. They want us out of business," Connecticut resident Scott Hoffman said. "They don't want the average American to have a right to defend themselves."
And New Hampshire gun owner Lloyd Clement said, "I think there's going to be an attack to some degree on the gun owners."
The Clinton administration imposed a ban on several types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines in 1994, but that ban was allowed to lapse in 2004. Obama has proposed restoring the ban, requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows, and other "common-sense measures."
They have said they support the rights of local governments to set their own gun laws, but believes the Second Amendment to the Constitution protects individual gun rights.
"I believe the Second Amendment means something. I do think it speaks to an individual right," Obama said in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in February.
With the U.S. economy in a tailspin, however, the president-elect's advisers say gun legislation is not a high priority.
"What people do is their own business, and if they decide to go out and buy guns they'll go out and buy guns, assuming that they are eligible to buy guns," John Podesta, the co-chairperson of Obama's transition team, told reporters Sunday. "But I think that President-elect Obama has been clear in their campaign that what they want to focus on is the economy, trying to get jobs growing again, dealing with the health care crisis, and dealing with our dependence on foreign oil."
Some customers are stocking up specifically on ammunition and point to concerns raised by the National Rifle Association, which ran anti-Obama ads during the campaign.
The NRA said Obama would support a "huge new tax on my guns and ammo," referencing a 1999 article in a Chicago newspaper saying the then-Illinois state senator promoted a plan to increase federal taxes by 500 percent on the sales of firearms and ammunition.
But as a state legislator, Obama would not have had any control over federal taxes. And as a U.S. senator and presidential candidate, they have not introduced or promoted such a proposal.
"I don't really believe it is fear. It is more there is just uncertainty," said Virginia customer David Reynolds, who was buying ammunition in the store as well as ordering more online.
"You know, we don't really know what is going on," they said. "There really hasn't been a lot of clear direction on where they support it, although they say they support the Second Amendment. But it just remains to be seen. I think some people are just uncomfortable with what their policy may be."

Chinese pharmaceutical chemist
Tu Youyou (Chinese: 屠呦呦; pinyin: Tú Yōuyōu; born 30 December 1930) is a Chinese pharmaceutical chemist and educator. They discovered artemisinin (also known as qinghaosu) and dihydroartemisinin, used to treat malaria, a significant breakthrough in 20th-century tropical medicine, saving millions of lives in South China, Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.
For their work, Tu received the 2011 Lasker Award in clinical medicine and the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura. Tu is the first Chinese Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine and the first female citizen of the People's Republic of China to receive a Nobel Prize in any category.  They are also the first Chinese person to receive the Lasker Award. Tu Youyou was born, educated and carried out their research exclusively in China.[3]
Early life [ edit ]
Tu was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, on 30 December 1930.[4]
My [first] name, Youyou , was given by my father, who adapted it from the sentence ‘ 呦呦 鹿鸣, 食野之蒿'[5] translated as ‘Deer bleat “youyou” while they are eating the wild Hao' in the Chinese Book of Odes. How this links my whole life with qinghao will probably remain an interesting coincidence forever. Tu Youyou, when interviewed in 2011 after being awarded the 2011 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award[6]
They attended Xiaoshi Middle School for junior high school and the first year of high school, before transferring to Ningbo Middle School in 1948. A tuberculosis infection interrupted their high-school education, but inspired them to go into medical research.[7] From 1951 to 1955, they attended Peking University Medical School / Beijing Medical College.[note 1] In 1955, Youyou Tu graduated from Beijing Medical University School of Pharmacy and continued their research on Chinese herbal medicine in the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Tu studied at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and graduated in 1955. Later Tu was trained for two and a half years in traditional Chinese medicine.
After graduation, Tu worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (now the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences[note 2]) in Beijing.
Tu and their husband, Li Tingzhao (李廷钊), a metallurgical engineer, live in Beijing. Li was Tu's classmate at Xiaoshi Middle School. They have two daughters. Tu's maternal grandfather, Yao Yongbai (姚咏白), was the first Director of National Treasury Administration after its reform. Them uncle, Yao Qingsan (姚庆三), was an economist and banker.[citation needed]
Research career [ edit ]
Tu carried on their work in the 1960s and 70s during China's Cultural Revolution, when scientists were denigrated as one of the nine black categories in society according to Maoist theory (or possibly that of the Gang of Four).
Schistosomiasis [ edit ]
During their early years in research, Tu studied Lobelia chinensis, a traditional Chinese medicine for curing schistosomiasis, caused by trematodes which infect the urinary tract or the intestines, which was widespread in the first half of the 20th century in South China.[citation needed]
Malaria [ edit ]
In 1967, during the Vietnam War, Ho Chi Minh, the leader of North Vietnam (which was at war against South Vietnam and the United States), asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai for help in developing a malaria treatment for their soldiers trooping down the Ho Chi Minh trail, where a majority came down with a form of malaria which is resistant to chloroquine. Because malaria was also a major cause of death in China's southern provinces, including Hainan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, Zhou Enlai convinced Mao Zedong to set up a secret drug discovery project named Project 523 after its starting date, 23 May 1967.[8]
In early 1969, Tu was appointed head of the Project 523 research group at their institute. Tu was initially sent to Hainan where they studied patients who had been infected with the disease.[9]
Scientists worldwide had screened over 240,000 compounds without success. In 1969, Tu, then 39 years old, had an idea of screening Chinese herbs. They first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine all over the country on their own. They gathered their findings in a notebook called A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria. Them notebook summarized 640 prescriptions. By 1971, their team had screened over 2,000 traditional Chinese recipes and made 380 herbal extracts, from some 200 herbs, which were tested on mice.[8]
One compound was effective, sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), which was used for "intermittent fevers," a hallmark of malaria. As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, "Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve". At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water. Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant;[10] Tu says they were influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong, which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.[11] This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.[3] After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore they proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead. The animal tests showed it was completely effective in mice and monkeys.[8]
In 1972, they and their colleagues obtained the pure substance and named it qinghaosu (青蒿素), or artemisinin as it is commonly called in the West,[10][12][13] which has saved millions of lives, especially in the developing world.[14] Tu also studied the chemical structure and pharmacology of artemisinin.[10] Tu's group first determined the chemical structure of artemisinin. In 1973, Tu wanted to confirm the carbonyl group in the artemisinin molecule, therefore they accidentally synthesized dihydroartemisinin.
Furthermore, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject. "As head of this research group, I had the responsibility" they said. It was safe, so they conducted successful clinical trials with human patients. Them work was published anonymously in 1977.[8] In 1981, they presented the findings relating to artemisinin at a meeting with the World Health Organization.[15][16]
For their work on malaria, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine on 5 October 2015.
Later career [ edit ]
They were promoted to a Researcher (研究员, the highest researcher rank in mainland China equivalent to the academic rank of a full professor) in 1980 shortly after the Chinese economic reform began in 1978. In 2001 they were promoted to academic advisor for doctoral candidates. Currently they are the Chief Scientist in the Academy.[17]
As of 2007, their office is in an old apartment building in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4]
Before 2011, Tu Youyou had been obscure for decades, and is described as "almost completely forgotten by people".[18]
Tu is regarded as the Professor of Three Noes[19] – no postgraduate degree (there was no postgraduate education then in China), no study or research experience abroad, and not a member of any Chinese national academies, i.e. Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.[20] Tu is now regarded as a representative figure of the first generation of Chinese medical workers since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.[21]

Even now, there are some who persist in claiming that Boris Johnson's use of the £350m a week figure was accurate. The UK's gross, as opposed to net EU contribution, is precisely this large, they say. Yet this ignores that Britain's annual rebate (which reduced its overall 2016 contribution to £252m a week) is not "returned" by Brussels but, rather, never leaves Britain to begin with.
Then there is the £4.1bn that the government received from the EU in public funding, and the £1.5bn allocated directly to British organisations. Fine, the Leavers say, the latter could be better managed by the UK after Brexit (with more for the NHS and less for agriculture).
But this entire discussion ignores that EU withdrawal is set to leave the UK with less, rather than more, to spend. As Carl Emmerson, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, notes in a letter in today's Times: "The bigger picture is that the forecast health of the public finances was downgraded by £15bn per year – or almost £300m per week – as a direct result of the Brexit vote. Not only will we not regain control of £350m weekly as a result of Brexit, we are likely to make a net fiscal loss from it. Those are the numbers and forecasts which the government has adopted. It is perhaps surprising that members of the government are suggesting rather different figures."
The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, to which Emmerson refers, are shown below (the £15bn figure appearing in the 2020/21 column).
Some on the right contend that a blitz of tax cuts and deregulation following Brexit would unleash higher growth. But aside from the deleterious economic and social consequences that could result, there is, as I noted yesterday, no majority in parliament or in the country for this course.
A new Boston Internet bank is planning a novel approach to attracting customers: Instead of spending millions on traditional advertising or promotions, it plans to give customers cash to donate to their favorite charities.
AbleBanking, a division of Northeast Bancorp. of Lewiston, Maine, is offering $25 to new customers, plus $2.50 a year for every $1,000 they keep in their accounts, to give to any qualified charity. The bank hopes to begin taking deposits by early next year.
“We're giving you this instead of a toaster,'' said Heather Campion, Northeast Bancorp's chief administrative officer, formerly an executive at Citizens Bank.

Of course, charitable giving is nothing new in banking. Bank of America, one of the nation's largest banks, gave more than $200 million to nonprofits last year, including $12 million in Massachusetts. Some community banks are even more generous, relative to their size.

But ableBanking, headquartered on Boylston Street, is one of a growing number of institutions that are leaving it to customers to decide where to send the money.
For instance, Capital One Financial Corp., based in McLean, Va., launched a website in 2008 to let credit and debit card customers donate their rewards points or cash to charities, without paying transaction fees. SunTrust Banks Inc., of Atlanta, offered a promotion four years ago to give new checking customers either $50 in cash or $100 to a qualified charity.
“I think we're seeing more and more of this because brands of all kinds realize that it's wise to align with the causes their customers like,'' said Katya Andresen, chief strategy officer at Network for Good, a company that processes charitable donations. “It gives your brand a halo effect when it is harder and harder to break through the clutter.''
Northeast Bancorp, with $600 million in assets and 10 branches in Maine, is launching ableBanking to boost deposits and increase the money it has available to lend, invest, and buy commercial real estate loans from other financial companies.

AbleBanking plans to offer interest rates on deposits similar to those at some other Internet banks, which typically pay more than traditional banks because they don't have the expense of operating physical branches.
AbleBanking faces stiff competition, however. There are more than 90 pure Internet banks or traditional banks with cyber branches where customers can open accounts, apply for loans, transfer funds, and make other types of electronic transactions, according to SNL Financial, a financial data provider in Charlottesville, Va. Several of them, including Ally Bank and Capital One, are spending millions of dollars on advertising.
“It's definitely an area of growth,'' said an SNL analyst, Patrick Sims. “A lot of banks are looking at various online strategies.''
AbleBanking executives are betting their commitment to charity will help it stand out. While many major banks, such as Bank of America, give about 0.02 percent of their deposits to charity each year, ableBanking plans to give 0.25 percent, more than 12 times as much.
“We'll be one of the most charitable banks or companies in the country,'' said Rick Wayne, chief executive of Northeast Bancorp.

Not every online bank has been successful. One of ableBanking's founders, Claire Bean, was involved with an Internet bank that foundered a decade ago. Lighthouse Bank, wound up costing its corporate parent, Brookline Bank, more than $10 million in losses from 2000 to 2001. But today's customers are more willing to bank online, Bean said.
“I really think it was a bit before its time, in terms of consumers' willingness to bank online without bricks and mortar,'' said Bean, chief operating officer for Northeast Bancorp. “The world has changed so much since then.''
Friday, Mike Rowe appeared on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight to discuss the demands being made by minimum wage protesters. Instead of simply offering standard answers to host Tucker Carlson's questions, Rowe went into detail about how we, as a society, devalue trade education, and the opportunities such education provides.
First, Rowe noted that automation is simply a fact of life:
... it's gonna happen. Just as surely as the internet messed up the TV, and the TV messed up cinema, and cinema disrupted radio, and radio messed up the newspapers, and Kindle messed up the booksellers, and so it goes. But I don't think it's anything to panic over — it's gonna happen.
Then, they spoke about vocational work in relation to the minimum wage issue:
... the only thing I can add to it is, with my foundation, we try to remind people that learning a skill that's actually in demand negates the whole conversation. If you can weld, if you're a plumber, if you're an electrician, if you're willing to learn a skill that has a pre-existing demand then you don't have to constantly negotiate and talk about a few extra dollars in order to stay in a position that frankly I don't know how you advance in that kind of thinking. So our philosophy is pretty simple. If you have a skill, and that skill is in demand, you can work where you want, and you can write your own ticket. If you don't, you're gonna have to hope the next negotiation works out and the next minimum wage position falls favorably in your direction — which strikes me as fatalistic.
Rowe added that society devalues trade jobs indirectly with the language used to describe them:
I think we've got it in our heads that there's a category of good jobs and bad jobs, that there's a category of good education and bad education. We don't call it that, we call it ‘higher education' and ‘alternative education.' But look, it's fun with the language right, and the minute you categorize an entire vertical of education as alternative, you might as well call it subordinate. So the message starts early on. If you go to a trade school, you're gonna have to settle for a second class job, or some kind of vocational consolation prize, and so parents don't want that for their kids ... So all these opportunities that today constitutes 5.6 million available jobs — open jobs, that are sitting there — they don't get any press and they don't get any love because somewhere in the back of our reptilian part of our brain we believe they're substandard. That's dumb.
Rowe expanded on the portability of trade jobs:
It's tempting to take a cookie-cutter approach to everything, and put every job — what's a news anchor make? It depends on — same thing with welding. If you get your certificate to weld, and you're in Oklahoma, you might start at 45 grand a year. A year later, you might be in western North Dakota making 120 grand, or in the gulf, doing better than that. The skill goes were you go. And this is another thing schools don't teach. If you have skill that's in demand, it's innate in you ... it's inherently mobile. You don't have to go to the McDonald's — with respect, right? You don't have to go to the retailer and stand behind the counter and wait for the business to come.
Rowe noted that these jobs, and the skills upon which they're built, can turn into small businesses:
On my old show, I can't tell you how many people I ran into who had a small business, who had employees, who had multiple trucks, but started with a skill. So, my thing with the minimum wage and with automation — with all of it — is that anything we do that knocks the bottom rungs off of the ladder that we all must surely climb is self-defeating. So, if getting to 15 bucks an hour hastens automation and therefore eliminates thousands of opportunities for kids who, by the way, are not just learning how to flip a burger, but how to tuck their shirt in, how to show up on time — basic stuff. I mean, how else do you learn that except by being in your first or second job? We are going to arbitrage logic right out of the equation and then R2D2, take a bow.
Rowe, former host of Discovery Channel's Dirty Jobs, is currently the CEO of the mikeroweWORKS Foundation, which is "a 501(c)(3) public charity that rewards people with a passion to get trained for skilled jobs that actually exist," according to the official website.

Recipe for Keto Mexican Omelette
My inspiration for this Keto Mexican Omelette comes from a restaurant that used to be on the seawall of West Vancouver. It was my favorite place to go for Sunday brunch after a nice long walk on the seawall.
It was not even a real restaurant, more like a cafeteria on top of a grocery store called Capers. This was before Whole Foods came to town and basically all these Organic and Natural little shops went out of business.
My favorite dish was their Mexican breakfast wrap and it is basically this dish without the wrap.
One of the ingredients for this omelette is spicy ground beef. A practice I have which is a real lifesaver on Keto and/or low carb is batch cooking on the weekend. I take a large package of ground beef, fry it up and add spices. This spices to add are of course up to your personal taste, I like to add 1 tbsp each of ground cumin and coriander per pound of beef. Then I also add some hot peppers to taste. This then becomes the base for many weekday meals such as Ketogenic Tacos, Taco-less Salad, Mexican Casserole and so on.
Keto Mexican Omelette (for 2 servings)
4 eggs
2 oz spicy ground beef
2 oz cheddar or monteray Jack cheese, grated
2 tbsp Salsa
That is for the basic omelette and then for the one that I made in the picture, I added these garnishes:
1/4 avocado, sliced
2 tbsp sour cream
1 tbsp sliced black olives
1 tbsp sliced picked jalapenos
2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro
In a bowl, crack the eggs and beat them with a fork or whisk. Pour egg mix into a heated frying pan (I use one of these new Green Earth Non-Stick pans , the teflon pans are BAD for you). After the egg sets, sprinkle the spicy beef, cheddar and salsa evenly over the egg and flip one side on to the other.
Cook for a bit, flip it over once and cook for a couple minutes on medium.
Divide the omelette in half and top each half with avocado, sour cream, olives and jalapeno.
This Keto Mexican Omelette as shown yields a ratio of 67/26/7 for the Ketogenic diet.
Per serving: Calories: 408, Carbs 8, Fat 31, Protein 27, Fibre 2
Just one bite and I was transformed back into time to the Dundarave seawall overlooking the beautiful Pacific ocean in West Vancouver. I won't promise that for you, but still it's an awesome Sunday morning breakfast!
Enjoy!
Vysor: Debugging Your Android TV Without a Monitor
I'm on winter break from my university right now, which means I have moved about half of my stuff back home. I didn't take my TV with me, it was big and wasn't really necessary. Although I do plan on doing some development with my ADT-1 this break, I don't actually need a TV to test apps. I'll explain how you can remote control your Android TV, and even see what's going on, without a monitor or even a debugging cable.
Vysor
First you will have to go to the Chrome App Store and install Vysor. It is an app written by Koush that can help you in debugging. When you plug in a device and start debugging, a window will pop up on your laptop. Vysor detects these devices and will show you exactly what's on the screen at that moment. It silently installs an app on your device to help in the remote connection. There are some options to quickly take a screenshot and other simple actions.
As you can see above, I have the ability both view and control every part of the TV using my laptop. I can still use the gamepad to navigate, or I can use my keyboard's DPAD to move around. Instead of using an onscreen keyboard, I can use my laptop keyboard. My mouse acts as a finger, allowing me to click things and swipe. Android TV wasn't built to work with a mouse or a finger, but it's still a really neat trick if you want to use some sideloaded apps.
There are buttons along the bottom to go home, back, or open recent apps. These are designed primarily for phones, as the TV doesn't have an overview screen. You can also use the Home key to go home and the Escape key to go back if you're more accustomed to a keyboard.
This is a great way for me to debug apps. As you can above, I'm working on a weather app on Android TV and I can see what's happening without a separate monitor. The image quality isn't always great. It can be pixelated with a lot of movement, and there is a noticeable delay between pressing a key and seeing a change. There's no support for audio pass-through either. While this doesn't work in a lot of conditions, like testing games, it does help you test code and see its results before hooking it up to a TV to test the user experience.
Wi-Fi Debugging
If you don't want to mess around with cables, you can use Wi-Fi debugging. As long as you're on the same Wi-Fi network, you can connect to your Android TV and upload an app. Vysor still works, so you can connect to your Android TV remotely and debug it. Wireless debugging requires you to enter a few commands in a terminal.
adb tcpip 5555 adb connect {device-ip-address}
Now I'm connected again, but without having to use a USB cable. I can set my ADT-1 in a corner and let it run while I sit elsewhere in the house. The experience is roughly the same.
You have to make sure your device is configured for debugging and you've enabled your laptop/desktop in the past. If not, Vysor will not work because your device won't be able to connect. You'll need to either connect to a TV to see and confirm the dialog, or try to figure it out on your own.
It's a nifty app that is still technically in beta. Koush is a skilled developer who will continue to support this app. Maybe a future update will change the UI for TVs so that the buttons make more sense. There are more things coming, as well as a supposed subscription model for more features, but those haven't been announced yet. Regardless, this development solution already works on Android TV, so it's likely going to get better over time.

Kitesurfing in Australia recently, Isabelle Fabre had an unexpected encounter with a great white shark. It'll likely be a story they dine out on for many years, and thanks to their friend back on the beach capturing the entire incident with a camera drone, she'll have some dramatic footage to show, too.
It happened while they were kitesurfing in the beautiful Fitzgerald River National Park about 250 miles (400 km) south-east of Perth. The French traveler spotted what they described as a “big black shadow” on the water, but wrongly assuming it to be their kite, they carried on surfing without a care in the world.
However, after a short while, they clocked that the movement of the kite and the “shadow” didn't quite match up. Indeed, their concerns grew when they noticed it “circling around me.”
In a drone video posted to Facebook showing the incident from up high, Fabre said that when the dark object passed directly beneath their board, they immediately realized that it was “a huge great white shark.” As anyone would do in such unnerving circumstances, they tried to get themselves back to shore as fast as possible, but with the winds frustratingly light, the going was slow.
As they neared the beach, Fabre heard their buddy, who'd also spotted the shark on their drone camera display, shouting at them to get away. But by that time they didn't need telling.
“I was struggling to get my ass out of the water, and I thought, ‘I'm done,'” they say in the video, embedded below.
Luckily for Fabre, they reached dry land with all their body parts intact, though they admitted they were pretty shaken up by the incident.
There were 26 reported shark attacks in Australia last year, with two fatalities among them. Always on the lookout for new ways to keep swimmers and other sea users safe, the authorities are taking an increasing interest in drone technology as a way to monitor waters.
For example, in 2015 New South Wales, whose coast covers nearly 700 miles and includes the city of Sydney, spent $16 million on tech-based solutions that included not only shark-detecting drones, but also “Clever Buoy” sonar gear, shark “listening stations” for real-time tracking, and a mobile app that alerts smartphone-owning beach-goers when a shark is in nearby waters.
You probably wouldn't know it from reading U.S. media today, but a major diplomatic incident erupted on Wednesday between Turkey and Russia. Russia's Foreign Ministry is warning of measures it may take in retaliation for Turkish F-16 jets forcing a Syrian airliner bound from Moscow to Damascus to land in Turkey with 16 Russian passengers on board. The Turks are insisting that the plane was carrying military equipment and ammunition for the besieged forces of Syrian President Bashir Assad to use against Syrian rebels. But the Russians are dismissing this allegation, claiming that if they wanted to send weapons to Assad they would've used their ships and existing port facility at Tartus as with recent arms shipments. Russia also says its 16 citizens on board the plane were traumatized by the experience and were not allowed to contact the Russian consulate for help within the first eight hours of the plane landing in Turkey, in violation of diplomatic accords with Turkey. The Syrian government claims the plane was carrying only what was listed on its cargo manifest and that the Turkish action constitutes ‘air piracy' in contempt of international civilian aviation treaties.
Turkish businesses to pay dearly for poking the Russian Bear
Russian President Vladimir Putin has no shortage of options they may use to punish Turkey for turning up the heat on the Assad government in Syria. Turkey sells over a billion dollars of fruits and vegetables and other agricultural goods to Russia per year. The Russian government could easily block those imports -- and, to further humiliate the Islamist government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russians will likely buy their winter produce from Israel instead. Russia could also cancel authorization for tourist charter flights that take thousands of tourists from Russia to Turkish Mediterranean resorts like Antalya or Izmir every month. For Turkish business people, the risks that they could soon feel pain in their wallets over their government's aggressive support of the Syrian rebels are very real, and that is motivating a growing opposition within the Turkish parliament to Erdoğan's interventions in neighboring Syria. But in addition to embarrassment ahead for Erdoğan, there are also larger repercussions -- and ironies -- looming for Washington's eternal Cold Warriors, including the advisors to Mitt Romney who told their man to describe Russia as America's number one geopolitical adversary. In addition to being a wily veteran of the KGB, the 60-year-old Putin is also a practicioner of judo. The Japanese martial art involves grappling with an opponent and using an adversary's own momentum to throw him. It is also a concept familiar to Chinese students of The Art of War -- exploiting an opponent's arrogance and allowing them to blunder onto the terrain of one's own choosing. By allowing Washington egg Turkey on into a confrontation with Russia it cannot win, Putin is also “creating daylight” (to use Mitt Romney's phrase) between the U.S. and once close American allies in the Near East, ranging from Greece to Iraq to (in the biggest shocker of all for the Romney camp) -- Israel.
Rocking the Crumbling Cradle of Civilizations -- Russia Woos Greece Away from EU/NATO
First Greece. While many neocon advocates for U.S. intervention in Syria were fixated on the action in Damascus and a looming confrontation with Assad's ally Iran, a growing opposition chorus in Greece is calling for the bankrupt country to leave the eurozone and turn toward Russia, China and Israel for economic support. While the Greek government insists it has no choice but to agree to European Union austerity measures, unemployment in the cradle of democracy has risen for 35 consecutive months, to the U.S. Great Depression level of over 25%. Hunger has become a very real problem in Athens and other Greek cities, and the opposition is starting to ask what Greece has left to lose by dumping the euro and adopting a devalued drachma to revive the economy. While all of this is taking place in Greece, the Russian government has shrewdly extended a multi-billion euro loan to the Greek-aligned government of Cyprus, which shares a border with Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus. The island in the eastern Mediterranean has also become one of the single largest ‘foreign investors' in the Russian Federation -- thanks to Nicosia being a major banking center for Russian companies, in industries ranging from shipping to mining to oil and gas. And the Russian investment in Cyprus is likely to grow thanks to the recently discovered Leviathian natural gas field nearby that Israel plans to tap.
While some Western media mindlessly parrots a line about ‘massive' capital flight from Russia, what is in fact happening is Russian companies are recycling billions in profits through European and Cypriot banks, and then repatriating the capital to Russia. Given Russian support for the Cypriots and a shared Orthodox Christian religion, it is quite possible that a bankrupt Greece will turn to Russia for investment when it finally defaults on its bad euro-denominated debts. What that likely means, in practice, is that Washington neocon efforts to push the Russians out of their base at the Syrian port of Tartus will backfire, leading to an even better Russian naval base in Greece. A twenty-year lease for the Russian navy at Athens' port of the Pireaus, for example, could probably be negotiated right now for less than 10 billion euros.
Given the historic enmity between Greece and Turkey which almost resulted in war during the 1970s while both countries were members of NATO, there is no sympathy for a Turkish invasion of Syria in Athens. Any NATO support for such an invasion could find itself undermined by leaks from Greek military officers or other NATO militaries sympathetic to the Greeks at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium (such leaks purportedly happened during NATO's offensive war against the Serbs over Kosovo in 1999). As it is, Syria's pro-Assad journalists as well as the Russia media have already pointed to the persecution of Orthodox Christians and Eastern rite Catholics by the Syrian rebels to win the sympathies of those not subject to an Anglo-American media blackout on that topic.
Iraq turns to Saddam's old patron, Moscow
Meanwhile in Iraq the U.S.-installed government of Nouri al-Maliki has turned on Washington by signing a multi-billion dollar arms deal with Russia this week. Instead of flying new or used Lockheed F-16s like Turkey, the Iraqi Air Force will fly Russian MiG-29 jets instead, and will also be buying Russian helicopters. After staying somewhat neutral on the Syrian civil war, Maliki has come out against any Turkish intervention in the conflict that has already claimed thousands of lives. The Maliki government has also started pushing U.S. oil major ExxonMobil out of a field in southern Iraq near Kuwait in favor of Russian oil companies. Iraq has also allowed overflights of Iranian planes carrying troops and weapons for the Assad government to use in its fight against Saudi, Qatari, and Turkish-backed rebels. The fact that Iraq is refusing to support the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in their plans to install a Sunni-Islamist government in Damascus after the minority Allawite-Shi'a government of Assad is overthrown must be infuriating to the Saudis. On top of that the Iraqis are pumping more oil which cuts into Saudi Arabia's profits, which have been artificially boosted by all the Western sanctions against rival oil producer Iran.
Dobre pozhalavut Jerusalem, Mr. Putin!
In what should be the most troubling development for the neocons that surround Mitt Romney who presume to be Israel's strongest supporters, even the Israelis may no longer be on board with a U.S. or NATO-led intervention in Syria. Israel may prefer the ‘devil it knows' in Bashir Assad, who has kept its Golan Heights border quiet, to the ‘devils it does not know' in the opposition, many of whom have ties to Al-Qaeda and have sworn to reconquer the Golan or even destroy Israel. Even the members of the so-called Free Syrian Army who are not card-carrying members of Al-Qaeda are aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Arab movement that recently captured the government of Egypt. While it's quite easy to blame Obama for the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood across North Africa and the Middle East, it would be a great irony if Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who both support arming Syria's rebels, would facilitate the creation of Muslim Brotherhood-dominated governments on two of Israel's three borders. For Israel, such an alignment would recreate the nightmare of a two-front war like the 1973 Yom Kippur War that claimed hundreds of Israeli lives and pushed the Jewish state's armies to the brink of exhausting their ammunition.
Into this breach between Washington's hawks and Israel has stepped one Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. In a story downplayed by most of the Anglo-American media (with the honorable exceptions of Breitbart.com and The Daily Beast) the Russian President was feted this summer at Israel's historic King David Hotel. The Russian delegation in June included so many business people that it booked 233 rooms at the hotel in Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Post reported that the Russian leader pushed all the right buttons with their hosts, telling a Jewish man that they prayed the Jews would one day rebuild their ancient Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. Putin also described Israel as a country with close ties to Russia, as more than one fifth of the population speaks Russian. What Putin said to Benjamin Netanyahu behind closed doors we can only speculate about, but it's likely they told Netanyahu they may prefer Assad to their likely hardline-Islamist successors. Putin may also have told the Israelis the 2009 Gaza flotilla incident provoked by Islamist elements in Turkey (the same elements that have a history of supporting jihadists in Russia's troubled Caucuses region) was unfortunate.
Moscow will be denouncing an Israeli strike on Iran all the way to the bank
Looking at the recent leaks by the Obama Administration to Foreign Policy magazine that many Israeli security thinkers complained about this summer, it's also possible that Russia has agreed to turn a blind eye to Israeli moves into Azerbaijan in preparation for a war with Iran. After all, any Israeli strike on Iran would be much more effective if Israeli Air Force jets and drones could refuel in or over Azerbaijan, which borders Iran to the north. Without refueling, it is doubtful that any strike by Israel going to alone would accomplish much against Iran's dispersed network of hardened bunkers. Furthermore, Russia maintains a very powerful radar station inside Azerbaijan at Gabala and could effectively control Azeri airspace via a fighter base in neighboring Armenia (this is the part of the story embarrassing to both Washington and Jerusalem that Foreign Policy's editors left out). For the neocons to claim if Israel strikes Iran that Russia via Azeri airspace that Russia was not in on it would defy all bounds of credibility, and permanently damage their eternal Cold War narrative that Russia is an implacable enemy of the West allied with Iran. And naturally, since Russia maintains one of the most ruthlessly pragmatic foreign policies on Earth, Moscow could denounce the Israeli aggression all the way to the bank as oil prices spiked (Russia is the world's largest oil producer). Netanyahu likely wouldn't care, so long as Israeli vegetables and technologies would continue to flow due north to Russia. Perhaps in that scenario the neocons would simply flip their script and shamelessly claim that Iran after years of being America's worst enemy was now simply a victim of Russian aggression.
All of these contradictions between what neoconservative hawks claim about the Middle East, Israel, and the postures of American allies towards “America's number one geopolitical adversary” are coming to a head. In their speech at the Virginia Military Institute this week, Mitt Romney vowed that there would be “no daylight” between Israel and the United States during their Administration. Whether Romney was referring to the daylight that Moscow has shrewdly exploited in recent months is unknown. But what is clear is that the policies advocated by Mitt Romney, including support for Turkey's aggressive moves and arming of the Syrian rebels, will push the Jewish State into more friendly consultations with Moscow. Thus while D.C. elites obsessed over failed outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood (Obama) or spending money the U.S. doesn't have to maintain raw military power (Romney), Moscow like Beijing is shrewdly playing the long game with clever diplomacy and investment.
