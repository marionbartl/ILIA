The European Commission warned Poland Wednesday that it could impose unprecedented sanctions if the country moves forward with plans to reform its judicial system.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has been given one week to halt reforms that would give the government greater control over the country's courts. European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said the EU executive is “getting very close” to triggering Article 7 of the EU's treaties.
The sanction has never been imposed before and would strip Poland of its voting rights at EU summits.
“Recent measures taken by the Polish authorities on the judicial system greatly amplify the threat to the rule of law in Poland,” Timmermans told reporters after a meeting with EU commissioners. “If implemented in their current form, these laws would have a very significant negative impact on the independence of the judiciary and would increase the systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland.”
Krzysztof Szczerski, President Andrzej Duda's chief of staff, said he was “surprised” by EU's threats since the reforms are “being done in accordance with the law,” Radio Poland reports.
Poland is one of three countries to face legal action from the EU over its refusal to abide by migrant relocation quotas.
The Times reported in April that Germany, France and up to 21 other countries are prepared to demand Hungary and Poland accept the quotas if they want to stay in the EU.
“They will have to make a choice: are they in the European system or not?” an unnamed senior diplomatic source told The Times. “You cannot blackmail the EU, unity has a price.”

In A Sea Of Homicide Stats, A Familiar Name — And A Heartbreaking Story
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jun Tsuboike/NPR Jun Tsuboike/NPR
It was a memorable name: Thelonious Monk, like the jazz musician.
And when Adam Marton read it, a decade-old memory came flooding back.
Marton is an editor at The Baltimore Sun. He was working on an infographic about the homicides in Baltimore in 2015 — a record 344 deaths, most of them black men, most of them shot to death.
Thelonious Monk was one of those victims. And years before, Marton says, Monk had stolen his car.
"I had dropped it off one evening and someone had fished the key out of a night-drop at the auto body shop," Marton told NPR's Renee Montagne on Morning Edition.
In A Sea Of Homicide Stats, A Familiar Name — And A Heartbreaking Story Listen · 4:15 4:15
It was an inconvenience, that's all. Marton and his wife got a loaner car from their insurance company and went on vacation.
A few weeks later, he got a call — his car had been found. It was waiting for him at the Baltimore City impound lot.
Marton went to pick it up. As he described on Facebook this week, what he saw in his vehicle has stuck with him ever since:
"Thelonious had installed a baby seat and a subwoofer and the car was strewn with job applications. It was and remains one of the most heartbreaking scenes of my life."
LISTEN: Adam Marton Reads From His Post
Marton read from his posting on Morning Edition, choking up as he commented on the differences between his life and Monk's:
"Our lives crossed, however oddly and briefly, and I can't help but think that Thelonious probably never had a chance. A chance to escape, a chance to succeed. The opportunities I have always enjoyed. I feel like maybe he was trying to use my car to make a break for it. I wish he had made it.
"Rest in peace, young man, I will never forget you."
I expected to see a crime scene, and what I saw instead was inside somebody's life.
"What I saw in the car told me a story about this man's life," Marton told Renee. "It seems at the time, it still seems today, that he took this car but he was kind of trying to make it his own car. 'I have this car now, now I can have a new life — I can go get a job, and drive my baby around, I can listen to music.'
"I expected to see a crime scene, and what I saw instead was inside somebody's life."
Marton doesn't know many details about how Monk died — he was shot in the chest in southwest Baltimore and died at the hospital.
But since posting on Facebook about the event, Marton says he's heard from several of Monk's family members. They remember him as someone who had "a lifestyle that most people think is wrong," Marton says, but was a good person.
"He was always trying to turn his life around," Marton says. "They talk about the great loss that they feel now that Thelonius is gone. And I think that's really telling. Especially when all you have to look at is a criminal record — this was a loved person who was trying to make his life better."
Jamie Reed. Stefan Rousseau PA Wire/PA Images LONDON — The Conservatives are favourite to win the upcoming by-election in Copeland — and the significance of this is difficult to overstate.
Bookmakers, including William Hill and Betfair, make the Tories strong favourites to nab the Cumbrian seat after it was left vacant by Labour MP Jamie Reed, who announced on Wednesday that he is resigning.
History tells us that Labour should go into Copeland expecting nothing less than victory.
Firstly, it has been a Labour seat since 1931. Copeland served as a prime example of a safe seat throughout the 20th century and well into the 21st. A Tory victory here would put an abrupt end to over 80 years of Labour dominance.
Secondly, it is pretty much unheard of for a party-in-government to gain a seat in a by-election. The last time it happened was in 1982 when a resurgent Tory government took Mitcham and Morden from Labour.
The circumstances surrounding this particular case were incredibly strange, though, as the sitting Labour MP had chosen to defect to the Social Democratic party before the by-election took place.
But in 2017 the history books could be thrown out the window, with the Tories preparing to throw everything at this by-election when campaigning gets underway — and they have every reason to do.
A constituency Labour has left behind
For decades Copeland, known as Whitehaven up until 1983, had all the ingredients for Labour victories.
A traditional industrial area, it's towns are and villages are now generally deprived and connected by transport links so neglected that it would be generous to describe them as a network. It has a proud mining heritage and strong trade union culture, the latter owing mainly to workers in the area's nuclear industry.
Pockets of loyal Tory support dotted around the Cumbrian coast meant Labour election victories were rarely massive, but as frequent as clockwork nonetheless. Copeland has been Labour since the seat's inception.
But now the political landscape is shifting under Labour's feet and Copeland is no exception.
Around 60% of people there voted for Leave in the EU referendum. Naturally, this means people there will feel more inclined to vote for the Tories, who have promised to deliver Brexit rather than Labour who campaigned against it.
Copeland is just one example of many pro-Leave constituencies in the north of England that are at risk of falling through Labour's grasp. It's a hunting ground for May and Paul Nuttall's UKIP too, although the success of the latter in targeting seats like Copeland could be undermined by the party's weak presence in the north of the country.

Then there's the area's demographics. While Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell and other members of Labour's cabinet come from the London bubble, Copeland is a white, working-class area, with barely any students and lots of retired people. Polls show that Corbyn is astonishingly unpopular with elderly people, who are also more likely to vote.
To borrow a turn of phrase from Business Insider's Adam Bienkov, for many older voters in rural seats like Copeland the Corbyn-led Labour is about as appealing as "a sack of rotten fish."
Then you have the rather massive and unavoidable elephant in the room: Corbyn's anti-nuclear stance.
Copeland forms part of one of the UK's main nuclear hubs. It is where Sellafield is based, a huge nuclear plant that employs around 10,000 people, many of who live in the surrounding area. It is where Reed will take up his next job.
Copeland's loyalty to Labour is going to be severely put to the test at this by-election, which is expected to take place in February."It's up Corbyn's henchmen and women to prove now that they are capable of winning," a Labour MP told Business Insider on Thursday. If Labour loses, it'll be a historic defeat and the clearest signal yet that the party is heading for disaster at the next general election.
The judgment by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, obtained by AFP on Friday June 10, found Tehran responsible for financing and training Hamas and Hezbollah operatives, who purportedly carried out eight bombings or hostage-takings in Buenos Aires, Israel, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia between 1983 and 2002. Tehran did not immediately comment on the court judgment.
“The broad issue before the court is whether Iran is entitled to immunity from the jurisdiction of Canadian courts for its support of terrorism,” Ontario Superior Court Justice Glenn Hainey claimed.
The move by Ottawa came after the US Supreme Court ruled on April 20 that Iran's assets frozen in a bank account, which are worth around $2bn, should be turned over to American families of those killed in a 1983 bombing in Beirut and other attacks blamed on Iran. Tehran has denied any role in the attacks.
The ruling for the $13m payout does not affect Iran's diplomatic property in Canada but does touch non-diplomatic properties and a list of frozen bank accounts, the report added.
This is while Canadian Foreign Minister Stéphane Dion confirmed on Friday that Ottawa has started “official” talks with Tehran in an attempt to renew ties with the Islamic Republic following a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. “Talks have started, yes, at the official level,” Dion said. Iran's ambassador the United Nations declined to comment when asked whether the talks were happening between the two country's missions to the UN.
Italy has been handling Canada's interests in the country since ties were cut four years ago. Canada broke diplomatic ties with Iran in September 2012.
“Thank God we have the help of the Italians but it would be much better if Canada were able to help itself as a country,” Dion added.
He would not speculate on the type of diplomatic presence Canada might pursue in Tehran, but added that an embassy was not a likelihood in the near future. “I would say it's step by step — and an embassy cannot be a first step.”
Groovy is an almost perfect complement to Java, providing a compact, highly expressive and compatible scripting environment for my use. Of course, Groovy isn't totally perfect; as with any programming language, its design is based on a series of trade-offs that need to be understood in order to produce quality results. But for me, Groovy's advantages far outweigh its disadvantages, making it an indispensable part of my data analysis toolkit. In a series of articles, I'll explain how and why.
In the late 1990s, I found myself becoming increasingly interested in the Java programming language, using it more and more for stuff that was too complicated for AWK and for most of what I used to do in C. By 2005, the low cost and great functionality of Linux had convinced me to ditch my beloved but aging Sun workstation. And for my kind of work, AWK, sort(1) , paste(1) , and join(1) had serious competition in the Linux environment, first from Perl, then from Python. The syntax of Perl has never been to my taste, but I found Python intriguing because of its readability, its "batteries included" philosophy, and its level of integration with all sorts of other stuff, such as delimited text files, spreadsheets, databases, graphing, except for one thing—it didn't give me what felt like clean and transparent access to the whole Java universe that was becoming increasingly central to my workflow.
And then I "discovered" Groovy.
Delimited text files
In my AWK-centric data analysis universe, working with data generally means working with delimited text files. This came about through a combination of two factors. The first was that Unix text file processing facilities generally recognized that data was often encountered in delimited text files—that is, text files whose lines, delimited by newline characters, were separated into fields, delimited by a field separator character (for example, a TAB, or some other unusual character, such as the vertical bar). The second was that tools such as spreadsheets tended to provide an "export" facility that produced comma-separated value text files, whose first line was by convention the names of each field, and whose remaining lines consisted of fields of data separated by commas (or, in countries that used the comma as a decimal point, by semicolons).
AWK is pretty good at dealing with delimited text files, unless the field or line delimiters also show up within the data. Moreover, AWK is also really geared toward being used to write stanzas of code that react to the data presented, and is not nearly so attractive when the data presentation is complex (for example, hierarchical). Nor does AWK really provide any good way to read from, or write to, a relational database, or a spreadsheet, or a binary format such as dBase, without passing through an intermediate delimited-text format.
This is where a more complete programming language—such as Python or Groovy— starts to become interesting. But before getting to those kinds of direct integration examples, I'm going back to delimited text. Let's write some code! But first, let's get some data! But wait—we better install Groovy first.
Getting Groovy
The best way to find out how to install Groovy is to go to the installation instructions at groovy-lang.org. I prefer to use SDKMAN for this purpose (documented midway down the installation instructions), but you can also install the version in your repositories. Note that Java is a prerequisite. These days, I use Java 8. Again, you can install the version in your repositories.
Getting data
Now that you have Groovy, use your browser to visit the open world population data from the World Bank site. On the right, you'll see a Download button. Get the data in CSV format; it comes zipped in a directory called API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2. Unzip this directory into a good place on your system. Then open a terminal window and cd into that directory.
Finally—some code!
Here is a simple Groovy script to read one of the CSV files you downloaded and print it to your terminal window:
= "Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv"
new File ( mdCountryCSV ) . withReader { reader -& gt ;
reader. eachLine { line -& gt ;
println line
}
} String mdCountryCSVmdCountryCSVreadergtreader.linegtprintln line
This script gives a good overview of what Groovy provides for Java programmers.
First the String mdCountryCSV = ... . This is "just like Java"—we are declaring a String variable that is initialized to a String literal. Oh yes, Groovy allows us to drop line-ending semicolons in most cases.
Next, new File(mdCountryCSV).withReader { reader -> , which is closed by a } four lines later. The new File() part is also just like Java; however, Groovy enhances a lot of java.lang.* , java.io.* , java.util.* , and other parts of the standard Java libraries. And in this case, Groovy enhances the File class with a method called withReader . This method accepts a closure as an argument, which in this case we manifest as the block of code { reader -> ... } . The reader -> defines the argument to the closure as the variable reader .
What does this Groovy newness accomplish? Functionally, withReader creates a Reader instance and calls the closure code with that instance assigned to the variable reader , finally closing the File instance created and releasing its resources and handling any errors that occur. Effectively, this lets the Groovy programmer declare anonymous methods as parameters to other method calls. Moreover, the surrounding context is available inside the closure without any special hocus-pocus.
Next, reader.eachLine { line -> , which is closed by a } two lines later. Again, we are seeing a Groovy-enhanced Reader method, eachLine , being called with a closure as an argument, which in this case we manifest with { line -> ... } . Here the Reader instance calls the closure for each line of the file read.
Finally, println line simply prints the line read by the Reader instance. Here Groovy shows us that it's OK to omit parenthesis around arguments to method calls, and also that it in effect has an import System.out as preamble to executing the code.
Save this code block as ex01.groovy in the same directory as the data and execute it from the terminal command line with:
groovy ex01.groovy
What do you see?
At this point, it's worth noting that Groovy also quietly did away with the imports and public class definitions that need to happen in a Java program that might carry out the same task.
Dealing with fields
So far, our Groovy script has dealt with line delimiters, but has yet to split the lines into fields. A quick examination of the file Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv will show that it is the most complex kind of CSV file—it uses commas as the field separator and quotes fields that can contain field or line separators.
Look at the third line, for Angola; in the fourth field, the phrase "Based on IMF data, national accounts" appears. And in the ninth line, for Argentina, not only commas appear in the same field but also carriage-return/line-feed pairs. Finally, on line 199, that field contains a double-quote character, which is shown as two successive double quotes; a "quoted," which is not to be confused with two successive double quotes as the only content of a field, implying an empty field. Ugly!
In AWK, dealing with this kind of messy stuff is less than pleasant; however, in Groovy, we can make use of a fine Java library called opencsv. Download the .jar file from SourceForge. Put that .jar file in Groovy's default lookup path—in your home directory, in the .groovy/lib subdirectory.
At this point, the first program can become field-aware:
import com.opencsv.CSVReader
= "Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv"
new File ( mdCountryCSV ) . withReader { reader ->
CSVReader csvReader = new CSVReader ( reader )
csvReader. each { fields ->
println fields
}
} String mdCountryCSVmdCountryCSVreaderCSVReader csvReaderCSVReaderreadercsvReader.fieldsprintln fields
Save this as ex02.groovy in the same directory and run it with the groovy command.
What's new here?
First, we have to import the CSVReader capability. Then we create a CSVReader instance from the reader handed to us by withReader . Finally, we print the fields yielded by the CSVReader instance. Here, we use the method that Groovy puts on every object and the line-splitting that opencsv provides in order to process the lines in the file. csvReader.each { fields -> gives us each line split into fields—that is, an array of Strings. We can refer to the first field as fields[0] , the second as fields[1] and so on.
Given that the first line of this kind of CSV file provides the field names, we can adjust the above code to let us refer to the fields by name, as follows:
import com.opencsv.CSVReader = "Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv" new File ( mdCountryCSV ) . withReader { reader -> CSVReader csvReader = new CSVReader ( reader ) String [ ] csvFieldNames = csvReader. readNext ( ) = new HashMap ( )
csvReader. each { fieldValuesByNumber ->
csvFieldNames. eachWithIndex { name, number ->
fieldValuesByName [ name ] = fieldValuesByNumber [ number ]
}
println "fieldValuesByName[ \" Country Code \" ] = " +
fieldValuesByName [ "Country Code" ] +
" fieldValuesByName[ \" IncomeGroup \" ] = " +
fieldValuesByName [ "IncomeGroup" ]
}
} String mdCountryCSVmdCountryCSVreaderCSVReader csvReaderCSVReaderreadercsvFieldNamescsvReader. HashMap fieldValuesByNamecsvReader.fieldValuesByNumbercsvFieldNames.name, numberfieldValuesByNamenamefieldValuesByNumbernumberprintlnfieldValuesByNamefieldValuesByName
Save this as ex03.groovy in the same directory and run it.
In the above code, we call the readNext from the CSVReader instance right away to get the first record, and save the field names in a String array. Then, every time we read a record, we execute the method on the field names to copy the values from the array of fields delivered by csvReader.each() into a map where the key is the field name and the value comes from the corresponding field on the record.
The println statement shows us accessing field values by name, for example, fieldValuesByName["Country Code"] .
Where to next?
That's probably plenty of Groovy to get started. Here are good references to enhance the experience:
Quite a number of Groovy books with good introductions to the language are also available.
The next installment in this Groovy series will take the themes already introduced further: making the last example groovier, reading multiple CSV files, linking their data, and writing out a composite/summary.

Welp, there goes Australia's Tekken representative…
It looks like activists are really trying to “politically correct” anything that they can get their hands on, and while video games haven't been an exception in this long struggle to prevent animal abuse, whether in real life or within the virtual realms of video games and entertainment, this time, the long-running Fighting Game franchise, Tekken, specifically the new installment, Tekken 7, makes the list as activists moved to remove the character Roger Jr, which is a boxing kangaroo, removed from the game's western versions.
As to why this happened, Katsuhiro Harada, one of the head honchos of the Tekken series and Executive Producer of Tekken 7, explains to us via VG24/7 that:
There was a video of a man's dog being headlocked by a kangaroo, and he punched it in the face, It turned into a big problem. People were complaining about him punching a kangaroo. It seems that in the last few years there's a lot more animal activists – even though they probably wouldn't play our game they would still hear about that, about a kangaroo in our game being punched, and would complain about it.
Now speaking of animals, while Roger Jr. is going to be cut out from the game, the bear Kuma will be staying and this is due to the fact that bears are stronger than humans, not counting Tekken's logic where a small dinosaur can take on a military class cyborg and the devil himself.
Sad to say, the decision has already been implemented, and unless you travel to Japan and play on their arcades or somehow manage to get a copy of the Japanese version of Tekken 7 working, we may never get the chance to have a Kangaroo square it off against Akuma in Fated Retribution.
Tekken 7 will be coming to the PC, PS4, and Xbox One worldwide on June 2, 2017.
Archbishop says he has seen mass grave of Christians killed by neighbours who said they feared being 'made to become gay'
African Christians will be killed if the Church of England accepts gay marriage, the archbishop of Canterbury has suggested. Speaking on an LBC phone in, Justin Welby said he had stood by a mass grave in Nigeria of 330 Christians who had been massacred by neighbours who had justified the atrocity by saying: "If we leave a Christian community here we will all be made to become homosexual and so we will kill all the Christians."
"I have stood by gravesides in Africa of a group of Christians who had been attacked because of something that had happened in America. We have to listen to that. We have to be aware of the fact," Welby said. If the Church of England celebrated gay marriages, he added, "the impact of that on Christians far from here, in South Sudan, Pakistan, Nigeria and other places would be absolutely catastrophic. Everything we say here goes round the world."
This reasoning has until now been kept private, although both Welby and his predecessor, Rowan Williams, anguished about it in private.
Welby also condemned homophobia in England. "To treat every human being with equal importance and dignity is a fundamental part of being a Christian," he said. Although he continued to uphold what he called the historic position of the church, of "sex only within marriage and marriage only between a man and a woman", he agreed with the presenter, James O'Brien, that it was "completely unacceptable" for the church to condemn homosexual people more than adulterous heterosexual people.
African churches do not share this opinion, and the Anglican churches in both Uganda and Nigeria have given enthusiastic backing to laws which criminalise even the expression of support for gay marriage. Despite these confusions, Welby denied that the church was woolly in its preaching in a testy exchange with the former Conservative cabinet minister Ann Widdecombe, who left the Church of England over its support of female priests in 1992, but phoned in on Friday to attack it. "I think the opponents of women's ordination are wrong theologically," he said.
Welby refused an opportunity to criticise Iain Duncan Smith on welfare reform, but he was unequivocal in support of the church's work with food banks and against inequality. He cited statistics showing that a third of those coming to food banks were entitled to benefits which had not actually been paid and another third were in employment, but for them "the month is a bit longer than the money".
"Whatever the causes, those are the people we are dealing with. They need to be treated with human dignity and they need to be loved. I do want to live in a country where the economy works in a way that means that food banks are no longer necessary," Welby said.
In remarks which showed the clear influence of Catholic doctrine, he said that food, house prices and energy costs were all moral issues that could not be left entirely to the market. "How much you charge for essentials is always a moral issue," he said.

In an SOS deal, a Rs 125 crore contract for 50,000 bulletproof vests is on the verge of being finalised. (File photo)
Highlights For over a decade, shortage of bulletproof vests Order for 50,000 is ready, delivery within 6 months The rest to be bought by end of the year: sources
Seven years after the Army, in distress, said it desperately needed nearly two lakh bulletproof jackets, action is being taken to plug a basic necessity for the soldiers who guard our borders and fight terrorists.In an SOS deal, a Rs 125 crore contract for 50,000 vests is on the verge of being finalised with a supplier that is part of the Tata group. A complete delivery will take place within six months.NDTV has learned that a contract with Tata Advanced Materials Ltd will be signed if they are able to submit production-grade samples which match the quality of the bulletproof jackets they showcased earlier during field trials.Earlier this week, a parliamentary committee that looks at Defence said, "It is an unpleasant surprise for the Committee that in spite of critical shortages of Bullet Proof Jackets being highlighted ... no improvement in the situation has taken place, which is alarming."Last year, a much larger deal to acquire 1.86 lakh bulletproof jackets fell through when none of the competitors met the standards laid down by the Army in trials. NDTV has learned that the Army has now issued a fresh tender for these jackets with clear instructions that companies interested in participating in trials need to submit their proposals by June. The Army wants these jackets to withstand .30 calibre armour piercing bullets, a requirement spelt out by the US National Institute of Justice level 4 (NIJ-4) which defines the global benchmark standards in body armour. The 50,000 jackets being immediately procured do not meet this standard and provide less than ideal protection for jawans from enemy bullets. Indian companies like Kanpur-based MKU and Tata Advanced Materials export body armour to armed forces around the world. Now, finally, the process of acquiring these jackets for India has picked up momentum, a move that couldn't have come a day later for the jawan defending the frontier.
With enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, also affably known as Obamacare, now closed for 2014, I believe it's fair to say that it's been a learning experience for all parties involved.
Obamacare, in a nutshell, is a complete transformation of how citizens in this country receive and pay for health care. There have been few precedents in history where such sweeping reforms have been implemented in the health care sector, so a learning curve was to be expected. Consumers had to learn how the law would affect them personally and understand how to make smart decisions by choosing a plan in an open marketplace. Businesses are also still in the process of understanding how part-time and full-time employees will be accounted for and affect their bottom-line. Even insurers have needed time to fully understand the demographics of their enrollees in order to price their premiums properly to both attract consumers and generate profits.
However, with a year under the belt so to speak, uninsured citizens who made the choice not to enroll for health insurance in 2014 may find that the smooth transition into Obamacare feels less like a slap on the wrist and more like a thud in 2015.
Obamacare penalties set to soar
Overall, more than 8.1 million people enrolled in a federal or state-run health exchange for 2014. Yet, according to initial estimates from the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center from early March -- which claimed that 5.4 million enrollees in Obamacare were previously uninsured – the uninsurance rate of 18 to 64 year-old persons in this country is still over 15%, or approximately 48 million using current Census figures. Of course, not every uninsured person will face a penalty under the individual mandate due to a number of circumstances including low-income and hardship exemptions, but it does mean that millions of Americans are facing a tax penalty on their 2014 return when they file by April 15, 2015.
For 2014, the first year where the Affordable Care Act and individual mandate went into effect, uninsured persons who aren't exempt will face a penalty equal to the greatest of $95 or 1% of their annual income, not to exceed cost of a bronze health-insurance plan.
In 2015, this gentle nudge toward signing up for health insurance is going to turn into something that resembles a push as Obamacare penalties are set to soar. Keeping with the idea of paying the greater of the two penalties, citizens who choose to go without health insurance for more than three months during the course of 2015 will face a penalty that's the greatest of $325 or 2% of your annual income, not to exceed the annual cost of a bronze health plan. In other words, the minimum penalty will rise a not-so-subtle 242% while the top-line percentage penalty will double!
Although the IRS is using its "trust-but-verify" approach to discern which individuals did and did not have health insurance during the prior year, it's clear that the IRS is going to take mandate collection very seriously with the agency requesting in 2012 to hire an additional 1,269 employees, at a cost of $473.4 million according to the Treasury Department, specifically to assist with the Affordable Care Act's implementation. Even though the IRS can't garnish your wages, seize your possessions, or throw you in jail for not paying your Obamacare penalty, if you're owed money (and more than 80% of taxpayers are owed a refund at year's end) it can withhold your penalty amount from your refund.
Will this be the result?
While the penalties themselves might not be overwhelming for many citizens, they could provide the impetus needed to persuade a number of currently uninsured individuals to sign up. As ACA penalties for non-compliance with the individual mandate continue to rise, the result will likely be an improvement in favorable enrollments for our nation's largest individual insurers such as UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and WellPoint (NYSE:ANTM). Remember, those unlikely to go to the doctor in the first place are probably among the healthiest (i.e., young adults). Getting these individuals signed up represents a key target for both UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint in their efforts to pay the higher costs associated with signing up sicker individuals. And given that UnitedHealth Group is showing signs of expanding their exchange footprint, it seems that they may recognize this opportunity (WellPoint is already competing aggressively for exchange lives, and estimates over 500,000 new members from the exchanges for this year).
But, the impetus to sign up may go beyond just the fact that the penalty for not having insurance is growing.
Part of the Obamacare learning curve also likely included uninsured individuals who chose to wait out a year to see how successfully the new health reform law was implemented. Following a year of better-than-expected enrollment and, thus far, primarily modest premium price increase requests from insurers, I would suggest that these modest cost increases could entice some on-the-fence uninsured individuals to sign up in 2015.
Another point to consider is that as the penalties for non-compliance with the individual mandate increase, the value proposition of potentially being able to claim tax deductions from health-care premiums paid versus paying a penalty which has no tax benefits may begin to flip in favor of signing up for health insurance.
I can speak from experience that, having signed up for Obamacare in my home state of Washington back in October, my penalty and the cost of enrolling in a health plan were fairly equal. In other words, I was going to pay a similar amount whether I chose to get health insurance or not. For me it made sense to both obtain coverage (I'm not getting any younger folks), and be able as a self-employed individual to claim my health-care premiums as a deduction. If I chose to simply pay the penalty I would receive no deduction and, worse still, would pay all medical costs out-of-pocket were they to arise. Obviously everyone's situation is unique, but I'd be surprised if there aren't other citizens out there that come to a similar realization next year.
Combined, all of these factors could spell a scenario conducive to higher quality enrollments in 2015 for both UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint.
Senators unwilling or unable to provide documented proof of their residence are being called on the carpet and forced to explain themselves in a series of meetings with members of the Senate's internal economy committee, CBC News has learned.
Those meetings begin today. It's unclear how many or which senators will be called.
Conservative senators David Tkachuk and Carolyn Stewart Olsen will play the role of interrogator, along with Liberal Percy Downe, the CBC's James Cudmore reported.
The internal economy committee asked all senators last December to prove where they live through drivers licences, health cards and tax filings. The committee is in charge of senators' budgets and administrative matters.
The audit was ordered following media reports suggesting some senators were claiming a living allowance despite having lived in the Ottawa area for years. The allowance is intended to cover senators who have to keep a second home in Ottawa after they are appointed. MPs receive a similar allowance.
The results of the audit are expected by the end of the week.
Government Senate Leader Marjory LeBreton and Liberal Senate Leader James Cowan have asked that the results of the audit be made public. In a letter to the committee, they also said any expenses that can't be backed up should be repaid.
Nothing to be shortcircuited
Senator Mike Duffy said Friday he would repay expenses claimed for his home in Ottawa, explaining he made a mistake in declaring that his primary residence was in Prince Edward Island. Other senators, including Pamela Wallin, Mac Harb, Dennis Patterson and Patrick Brazeau, have faced questions about their expense claims and residency declarations.
Cowan said Monday that paying back the expenses may not be enough, depending on the results of the audit.
"That's not necessarily the end of it, absolutely not. It may be, but it depends on what the audit report says," Cowan said.
Emphasizing that he can't speak for any senator but himself, Cowan said he finds the form filled out by senators to be perfectly clear. If there is something confusing about a form he's filling out, he says, "You ask about it. That's what I do when I don't understand something. I never sign anything that I don't understand."
Cowan says he and LeBreton agree on how the issue of senator expenses should be handled, regardless of party.
"I don't think there's any difference between Senator LeBreton and me on this. We are both determined that this is dealt with fairly, openly, transparently, and nothing's going to be swept under the carpet. Nothing's going to be shortcircuited."
'Unacceptable for any other Canadian'
In question period, the opposition New Democrats compared the Conservative government's tough approach with abuse of the Employment Insurance system to the approach taken with the party's senators.
NDP Leader Tom Mulcair pointed to Duffy's claim that the form senators have to fill out is unclear, and to the fact Wallin has an Ontario health card but tells the Senate she resides in Saskatchewan.
"He says the form is too complicated …She told the federal government that she lived in one province while telling a provincial government that she lived in another. This would be unacceptable for any other Canadian. Why does the prime minister seem to think it's acceptable for his Conservative senators?" Mulcair said.
NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus said EI forms tell applicants that if they misrepresent the facts to make a false claim, they are committing fraud and could be prosecuted.
"So will the government hold senators who break the rules to the same standards they hold unemployed Canadians to?" Angus said.
Government House Leader Peter Van Loan says the government has committed to ensuring expenses and the rules governing them are appropriate, and to reporting publicly about them.
"Senators Patterson, Wallin and Duffy all own property in the provinces and territory they represent. They maintain deep and continuing ties to those regions and in fact three senators all spend considerable time in their home provinces and territory," he said.
"The reality is if you want to see real change in the Senate, if you want to see real change towards an accountable Senate, you need to embrace the Conservative proposal to actually let Canadians have a say who represents them in the Senate. The NDP simply won't do that."
Vancouver city councillor Geoff Meggs says that's doubtful because we don't know yet who's in charge of BC
Uber says the Liberals, New Democrats and Greens all promised to make ride-hailing services available by the end of 2017
VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – As British Columbians wait to see what shape the provincial government takes over the next few weeks, the operators of a major ride-hailing service are still expecting to set up in the province by the end of this year.
Uber Canada's Susie Heath wasn't available for comment, but she has issued a statement suggesting the Liberals, New Democrats and Greens all promised to make ride-hailing services available by the end of 2017.
Vancouver city councillor Geoff Meggs says that's doubtful because we don't know yet who's in charge in Victoria.
“We don't have a provincial government really at this stage, so it's pretty difficult to predict,” he says.
Meggs, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Uber, also says so-called price surging in London over the weekend is driving customers away.
“There are other ride-sharing companies out there who've tried to take a lesson from this,” he says. “Lyft, which is only operating in the United States, sometimes will send its cars for free to trouble spots.
“Uber has run into these problems on a number of occasions, including in New York when there was a demonstration against Trump's immigration legislation. Uber seemed to take advantage of that by driving up prices.”
Uber officials admit charges were initially jacked up during Saturday night's violence in London, but say what they call ‘dynamic pricing' was quickly halted and drivers started giving people free rides out of the danger zone.
WASHINGTON: A US businessman has pleaded guilty to exporting products without a licence to atomic and space agencies in Pakistan, violating US federal laws. Imran Khan, 43, faces up to 20 years in prison.
US Attorney for the District of Connecticut Deirdre Daly said that Khan, a resident of North Haven, waived his right to indictment and pleaded guilty on Saturday in a Hartford federal court to violating US export law.
Court documents and statements show that from 2012 to December 2016, Khan and others were engaged in a scheme to purchase goods that were controlled under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and exported them without a licence to Pakistan, in violation of the EAR.
Suspect Imran Khan faces up to 20 years in prison
Khan conducted business as Brush Locker Tools or as Kauser Enterprises-USA.
When asked by the US manufacturers about the end-user for a product, Khan either informed them that the product would remain in the US, or he completed an end-user certification indicating that the product would not be exported.
After the products were purchased, they were shipped by the manufacturer to Khan's North Haven residence in Connecticut or to a business owned by him.
“The products were then shipped to Pakistan on behalf of either the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) or the National Institute of Lasers and Optronics (Nilop),” the US Justice Department said. All these organisations listed on the US Department of Commerce Entity List, it added.
“The illegal exportation of sensitive technology to prohibited entities such as PAEC, Suparco and Nilop, poses a significant threat to our national security,” said Leigh-Alistair Barzey, special agent in-charge of the Defence Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Northeast Field Office.
The Justice Department said that Khan never obtained a licence to export any item to the designated entity even though he knew that a licence was required prior to export.
Khan pleaded guilty to one count of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
He admitted that between August 2012 and January 2013, he procured, received and exported to the PAEC an “Alpha Duo Spectrometer” without a licence to do so.
Khan is scheduled to be sentenced by US District Judge Vanessa Bryant in August 2017, at which time he faces a maximum prison term of 20 years.
He has been released on a $100,000 bond since he was arrested in December last year.

Fifty years ago, Link Wray's “Rumble,” a snarling instrumental, was banned by radio stations because programmers worried that the song's grinding distortion would incite teenage audiences to West Side Story- esque delinquency. Perhaps an overreaction, but at least this censorship showed a respect for the power of wordless music. Try getting your wordless tune on the radio today. From 1960 to 1974, 128 instrumentals reached the Top 20, while only 30 did from 1975 to 1990. And since? Five. These standouts are likely remembered only by smooth-jazz aficionados and soundtrack collectors: “Lily Was Here” by David A. Stewart and Candy Dulfer; Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen's remake of the Mission: Impossible theme; “Southampton” from Titanic; and Kenny G's “Forever in Love” and “Auld Lang Syne.”
While wordless pop has disappeared from commercial radio, pop music has become ever more long-winded. The year-end top 10 songs from 1960 to 1969 have an average word count of 176. For the 1970s, the figure jumps to 244. In 2007, the average climbed to 436. The top 10 for the week of Feb. 2, 2008, features six songs over the 500-word mark. Chris Brown and T-Pain use 742 words in their “Kiss Kiss.” While music can express what words cannot, music rarely gets a chance in contemporary pop, and certainly not in “Kiss Kiss.” Except for the first two seconds, vocals fill the song's every moment. Entirely absent are instrumental phrasings that allow a song (and singers) to breathe. Guys, take a break.
In contrast, the Great American Songbook is a bible of pithiness. “Blue Moon,” “Over the Rainbow,” and “Embraceable You” all make their cases in fewer than 100 words. Will Smith, Kenny Chesney, Bon Jovi, and Beyoncé all have songs called “Summertime” yielding word counts three to five times as high as Gershwin's tune of the same name. They all have a similar message: “The livin' is easy.” But with only 92 words, Gershwin says it best by letting the melody become part of the story. Done well, the song sounds like a hazy, slow summer day. In Smith's “Summertime,” he recalls hanging out in Philly parks, in Mercedes-Benzes, and at a place called “The Plateau,” where everybody goes. All I picture are the Fresh Prince's summers. They sound fun, but I want my own. Gershwin's lyrical economy makes room for our own dog-day memories. Instrumentals are even easier to personalize. With no lyrics to dictate my emotional response, Funkadelic's “Maggot Brain” conforms to my mood. When it's playing on my stereo, just driving around assumes a cinematic brio.
In the contemporary radio landscape, instrumental blockbusters like Duane Eddy's “Peter Gunn” simply don't happen anymore. Considering the cultural impact they've had, that's a shame. The ubiquity of “Green Onions” by Booker T. & the M.G.'s (used in at least 15 movies and countless beer commercials) makes us forget just how good this swaggering and slightly dangerous-sounding piece is. Long before there were video games, the Tornados' “Telstar” sounded like one in 1962. The song, with noises supposedly from the first communication satellite (launched months prior), has the spirit of a world giddy about space exploration. Edgar Winter's jam “Frankenstein” (and his early version of a keytar) and the laid-back sounds of fluegelhornist Chuck Mangione are gold mines for students of the 1970s. “Axel F” from the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack and “Miami Vice Theme” (our most recent No. 1 instrumental) tell us much of what we need to know about the 1980s. Herbie Hancock gave hip-hop its watershed instrumental in 1983 with “Rockit“—the first time many people heard record scratching.
Science offers some clues, if not a smoking gun, in the music vs. lyrics debate. Neuroscientists believe that the brain uses a different system to store and process music than it does words. Not much research has been done on which affects us more, but an American University study published in the Psychology of Music in 2006 gives a slight edge to melody. When listening to happy or calm songs, subjects found that lyrics dulled the tunes' emotional kick. Words, however, enhanced emotional responses to angry and sad songs. When researchers mismatched the melodies and lyrics—sad words with happy music, etc.—melodies held more sway with participants' moods than lyrics. Possible real-world application (my theory): Of all the phenomenal singers who have tackled the “Star-Spangled Banner,” Jimi Hendrix's tortured, celebratory, and wordless version remains the most emotionally layered.
I understand the appeal of the human voice, and I certainly can't begrudge anyone's joy at singing along in the car (unless I'm in it). But why such shabby treatment for the instrumental? Marketability. A band is practically faceless with no crooning frontman. People still credit the Surfaris' “Wipe Out” to the Ventures, the Beach Boys, or, bizarrely, Morton Downey Jr. And it's not as if good instrumental music isn't still getting produced. Singerless combos emerged in big numbers in the 1990s, and instrumental buffs have their pick of genres: electronica, sprawling post-rock, cello metal. But even the danceable and hooky pop of Ratatat runs into the same wall: No singer means no airplay. The experimental but profoundly catchy Battles didn't break out until the group added vocals on 2007's Mirrored.
Here's another problem for the instrumental: Fancy a new song, but don't know the name? You can Google the chorus. But with no words to work with, you're reduced to humming the guitar part to friends and record-store clerks, hoping they'll recognize it. They won't. Music journalists also share some responsibility. Words are writers' friends—they're easier to critique than a musical phrase the reader can't hear (although hyperlinks change this a bit). Take Black Sabbath's “Iron Man”: I can go on for quite a while about the title character's tragic circumstances, but it's the riff that raises the song to pioneering doom classic. For all of the riff's majestic awesomeness, though, I'm at a loss to describe it.
Finally, there's Bob Dylan, the man perhaps most responsible for the word/music power imbalance. With the releases of “Wipe Out” and Lonnie Mack's “Memphis” in 1963, things looked bright for the rock instrumental. Then came The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and his 564-word “A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall.” That year, the New York Times likened his songs to “speeches delivered to guitar chording” and called him “an inspired poet.” Two years later, the Times reported that everyone was copying him.
UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 17: Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, speaks with Roll Call in his office in the Hart Senate Office Building on Monday, Nov. 17, 2014. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)
House and Senate leaders have agreed to cut funding for the nation's largest source of grants for college students to pay student loan contractors, according to legislation that would fund the federal government through next year and avert a shutdown.
Money appropriated for the Pell grant program this year would fall $303 million, or 1.3 percent, to $22.5 billion, according to a proposal first introduced over the summer by retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Most of those funds would instead be used to pay private contractors that collect borrowers' monthly student loan payments. Harkin has defended the move as necessary.
The provision, which faced a flurry of criticism after it was revealed in a Huffington Post article published Saturday, was expected. Lawmakers are likely to pass the more than $1 trillion spending bill in the coming days. The government's spending authority expires Thursday.
The cuts come amid an era of record college costs, skyrocketing student debt burdens and decreasing government support for state schools. The Pell program has a budget surplus that is forecast to turn into a deficit in two years. Cuts to the program would likely lead college students to increase the amount they borrow, further driving up the nation's $1.3 trillion stack of unpaid student loan bills.
Meant for low-income students, three of every four Pell recipients during the 2012-13 award year had household incomes of $30,000 or less, according to the Department of Education. Nearly 8.9 million students are forecast to receive on average $3,826 from the program this fiscal year, White House budget documents show.
The Department of Education's student loan servicers -- companies that counsel borrowers, set them up with repayment plans and collect their monthly checks -- are set to reap the rewards from lawmakers' cuts to Pell. They'll get up to $721.7 million, an $8 million cut from last year, but a nearly $44 million increase compared with 2013.
The cash comes at a time when the Education Department's loan servicers are under intense scrutiny.
Federal officials have accused them of mistreating borrowers and hurting taxpayers, state attorneys general are probing their allegedly anti-consumer practices, and some student advocates are pushing for their lucrative contracts to be terminated.
Nearly 23 percent, of loans in the government's main student loan program are either delinquent or in default, according to a Dec. 1 presentation by the Education Department. Given the availability of generous federal repayment plans, consumer advocates point to poor servicing practices as a reason behind high delinquency rates.
Federal policymakers worry the growing ranks of troubled borrowers will sap economic growth in the coming years. President Barack Obama in June questioned the Education Department's loan servicers' commitment to helping borrowers manage their student debt.
The Department of Justice in May accused one of the government's loan servicers, Navient Corp., formerly known as Sallie Mae, of deliberately cheating as many as 60,000 active-duty troops out of as much as $60 million. Navient neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
Despite those concerns, it seems at the moment that the Obama administration and congressional leaders are more concerned with ensuring payments to companies such as Navient and Nelnet Inc. than helping college students pay for college.
“This bill takes a thoughtful approach to funding these critical programs because it funds America's priorities and it is how we invest in our future,” Harkin, the Senate's leader on education issues, said in a prepared statement.
A spokeswoman, Susannah Cernojevich, did not make Harkin available for an interview.
In July, a Harkin-led Senate appropriations subcommittee explained its decision to cut funding for Pell grants to instead pay student loan contractors by pointing to the recent elimination of a pot of money previously set aside exclusively for loan servicing.
But neither Harkin nor his staff have publicly explained why the money to pay for servicing had to come from Pell.

Bill Maher is taking credit for the swift downfall of Milo Yiannopoulos. In a New York Times interview posted online this morning, Maher suggests that Yiannopoulos' appearance on last Friday's Real Time With Bill Maher was the “disinfectant” needed to expose the now-ex Breitbart News provocateur.
Maher's decision to book the right-wing loudmouth came under considerable fire last week, most notably when scheduled fellow guest Jeremy Scahill refused to appear on the same episode.
“I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant,” Maher tells The Times, appropriating the brilliant phrase from the great Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis. “Then we had Milo on, despite the fact that many people said, ‘Oh, how dare you give a platform to this man.' What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe, trying to make a buck off of the left's propensity for outrage.
“And by the end of the weekend, by dinnertime Monday, he's dropped as a speaker at CPAC. Then he's dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You're welcome.”
While the Real Time exposure certainly gave much of America its first look at Yiannopoulos, the conservative speech-maker's profile was no doubt boosted pre-Maher by the anti-Milo riot earlier this month at the University of California, Berkeley, and his subsequent booking at the Conservative Political Action Conference.
Yiannopoulos' downward spiral on Monday – he lost the CPAC gig, a Simon & Schuster book deal and his job at Breitbart News – came after a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion unleashed footage from a 2016 interview showing Yiannopoulos smugly endorsing sex with 13-year-old boys and joking about his own under-age relations with a Catholic priest.
Pushed by The Times on whether he went too easy on Yiannopoulos during the HBO episode, specifically regarding his guest's insults against transgender people, Maher (correctly) pointed out that the issue “dominated the entire [online] segment.”
“You know what he is?,” Maher says of Yiannopoulos. “He's the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream.”
The pheromones of the honey bee are mixtures of chemical substances released by individual bees into the hive or environment that cause changes in the physiology and behaviour of other bees.
Introduction [ edit ]
Honey bees (Apis mellifera) have one of the most complex pheromonal communication systems found in nature, possessing 15 known glands that produce an array of compounds.[1][2] These chemical messengers secreted by a queen, drone, worker bee or laying worker bee to elicit a response in other bees. The chemical messages are received by the bee's antenna and other body parts. They are produced as a volatile or non-volatile liquid and transmitted by direct contact as a liquid or vapor.
Honey bee pheromones can be grouped into releaser pheromones which temporarily affect the recipient's behavior, and primer pheromones which have a long-term effect on the physiology of the recipient. Releaser pheromones trigger an almost immediate behavioral response from the receiving bee. Under certain conditions a pheromone can act as both a releaser and primer pheromone.
The pheromones may either be single chemicals or a complex mixture of numerous chemicals in different percentages.[3][4]
Types of honey bee pheromones [ edit ]
Alarm pheromone [ edit ]
Two main alarm pheromones have been identified in honeybee workers. One is released by the Koschevnikov gland, near the sting shaft, and consists of more than 40 chemical compounds, including isopentyl acetate (IPA), butyl acetate, 1-hexanol, n-butanol, 1-octanol, hexyl acetate, octyl acetate, n-pentyl acetate and 2-nonanol. These chemical compounds have low molecular weights, are highly volatile, and appear to be the least specific of all pheromones. Alarm pheromones are released when a bee stings another animal, and attract other bees to the location and causes the other bees to behave defensively, i.e. sting or charge. The alarm pheromone emitted when a bee stings another animal smells like bananas.[5] Smoke can mask the bees' alarm pheromone.
The other alarm pheromone is released by the mandibular glands and consists of 2-heptanone, which is also a highly volatile substance. This compound has a repellent effect and it was proposed that it is used to deter potential enemies and robber bees. The amounts of 2-heptanone increase with the age of bees and becomes higher in the case of foragers. It was therefore suggested that 2-heptanone is used by foragers to scent-mark recently visited and depleted foraging locations, which indeed are avoided by foraging bees. However, this has recently been proven false. In a new discovery, it was determined that bees actually use 2-heptanone as an anesthetic and to paralyze intruders. After the intruders are paralyzed, the bees remove them from the hive.[6]
Brood recognition pheromone [ edit ]
Another pheromone is responsible for preventing worker bees from bearing offspring in a colony that still has developing young. Both larvae and pupae emit a "brood recognition" pheromone. This inhibits ovarian development in worker bees and helps nurse bees distinguish worker larvae from drone larvae and pupae. This pheromone is a ten-component blend of fatty-acid esters, which also modulates adult caste ratios and foraging ontogeny dependent on its concentration. The components of brood pheromone have been shown to vary with the age of the developing bee. An artificial brood pheromone was invented by Yves Le Conte, Leam Sreng, Jérome Trouiller, and Serge Henri Poitou and patented in 1996.[7]
Drone pheromone [ edit ]
Drones produce a pheromone that attracts other flying drones to promote drone aggregations at sites suitable for mating with virgin queens.
Dufour's gland pheromone [ edit ]
The Dufour's gland (named after the French naturalist Léon Jean Marie Dufour) opens into the dorsal vaginal wall. Dufour's gland and its secretion have been somewhat of a mystery. The gland secretes its alkaline products into the vaginal cavity, and it has been assumed to be deposited on the eggs as they are laid. Indeed, Dufour's secretions allow worker bees to distinguish between eggs laid by the queen, which are attractive, and those laid by workers. The complex of as many as 24 chemicals differs between workers in "queenright" colonies and workers of queenless colonies. In the latter, the workers' Dufour secretions are similar to those of a healthy queen. The secretions of workers in queenright colonies are long-chain alkanes with odd numbers of carbon atoms, but those of egg-laying queens and egg-laying workers of queenless colonies also include long chain esters.[8]
Egg marking pheromone [ edit ]
This pheromone, similar to that described above, helps nurse bees distinguish between eggs laid by the queen bee and eggs laid by a laying worker.
This pheromone is left by bees when they walk and is useful in enhancing Nasonov pheromones in searching for nectar.
In the queen, it is an oily secretion of the queen's tarsal glands that is deposited on the comb as she walks across it. This inhibits queen cell construction (thereby inhibiting swarming), and its production diminishes as the queen ages.
Forager pheromone [ edit ]
Ethyl oleate is released by older forager bees to slow the maturing of nurse bees.[9] This primer pheromone acts as a distributed regulator to keep the ratio of nurse bees to forager bees in the balance that is most beneficial to the hive.
Nasonov pheromone [ edit ]
Nasonov pheromone is emitted by the worker bees and used for orientation and recruitment. Nasonov pheromone includes a number of different terpenoids including geraniol, nerolic acid, citral and geranic acid.
Other pheromones [ edit ]
Other pheromones produced by most honey bees include rectal gland pheromone, tarsal pheromone, wax gland and comb pheromone, and tergite gland pheromone.
Types of queen honey bee pheromones [ edit ]
Queen mandibular pheromone [ edit ]
Queen mandibular pheromone (QMP), emitted by the queen, is one of the most important sets of pheromones in the bee hive. It affects social behavior, maintenance of the hive, swarming, mating behavior, and inhibition of ovary development in worker bees.[10] The effects can be short and/or long term. Some of the chemicals found in QMP are carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds. The following compounds have been shown to be important in retinue attraction of workers to their queen and other effects.[11]
( E )-9-Oxodec-2-enoic acid (9-ODA) – inhibits queen rearing as well as ovarian development in worker bees; strong sexual attractant for drones when on a nuptial flight; critical to worker recognition of the presence of a queen in the hive

4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy phenylethanol (HVA)
Work on synthetic pheromones was done by Keith N. Slessor, Lori-ann Kaminski, Gaylord G. S. King, John H. Borden, and Mark L. Winston; their work was patented in 1991. Synthetic queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) is a mixture of five components: 9-ODA, (−)-9-HDA, (+)-9-HDA, HOB and HVA in a ratio of 118:50:22:10:1.
Queen retinue pheromone [ edit ]
The following compounds have also been identified,[12] of which only coniferyl alcohol is found in the mandibular glands. The combination of the 5 QMP compounds and the 4 compounds below is called the queen retinue pheromone (QRP). These nine compounds are important for the retinue attraction of worker bees around their queen.
Other [ edit ]
The queen also contains an abundance of various methyl and ethyl fatty acid esters,[17] very similar to the brood recognition pheromone described above. They are likely to have pheromonal functions like those found for the brood recognition pheromone.

Leadership is one of the most difficult tasks for man to undertake. It requires a rare combination of wisdom, courage, knowledge and experience. Very few people possess all of these qualities and even fewer know the art of combining them in a balanced way.
When looking into the personality of Moshe Rabbeinu, we learn an astonishing story of how he became capable of undertaking the most challenging leadership role in the history of man: liberating a few million slaves from an anti-Semitic dictatorship and transforming them into a nation of God, with the added mission of teaching mankind the highest level of ethics.
One might think that the ability to inspire a few million people to fear God would require the best religious education available, with only the finest teachers. A person of that caliber should also be holy, living in a well-protected environment into which outside heretical ideologies do not penetrate and where secularism plays no role. Only from a background like that could emerge a man who would be great enough to experience an encounter with God and receive His teachings. But in reading the story of Moshe, we are confronted with a different truth.
When Moshe leaves Pharaoh's palace for the first time, to visit his enslaved brothers, he is struck by the hard realities of life. Right in front of him an Egyptian strikes a Hebrew, possibly with the intention of killing him. Without hesitation, Moshe smites the Egyptian and buries him in the ground.
Reflecting on the fact that Moshe had just left Pharaoh's home, in which he was raised for many years, we wonder what went through his mind. Whose side was he going to take? Brought up in the world of Egyptian culture, and instructed by elite Egyptian educators, possibly receiving private tutelage from Pharaoh himself to prepare him for the monarchy of Egypt in years to come, Moshe must have seen the Egyptian as a compatriot. This was a man of his own culture! Why take any action against him? On the other hand, it would seem from the text—“he went out to his brothers” (1)—that Moshe knew he was of Jewish lineage, despite being far removed from anything Jewish. He had warm feelings towards the Jews, though they were foreigners to him. Psychologists would no doubt raise the question of Moshe's dual loyalties and how to resolve this dilemma.
A deeper reading of the verses may give us some insight. “And he (Moshe) turned this way and that way, and he saw there was no man, and he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand” (2). As suggested by an unknown commentator, this may allude, albeit in an allegorical way, to the state of Moshe's mind. Moshe suddenly realized that he was living in two worlds. While his youth was spent in the world of Egyptian culture regarding knowledge, art and religion, his heart was elsewhere. Deep down inside of him was a Jewish voice demanding the opposite of everything Egypt represented. It is for this reason that “he turned this way and that way.” Moshe realized that he was at a crossroads in his life and that “there was no man.” As long as he did not decide to which world he belonged, he was a man with neither character nor strength. He therefore killed the Egyptian man within himself and buried him in the sand.
It is this decision that turned the world on its head, steering mankind in a completely different direction. Made in the blink of an eye, this is possibly the most radical decision ever made in human history, causing both Jews and gentiles to put God at the center of their lives and commit themselves to a higher ethical mission. But Moshe must have also realized that by ending his ambivalent situation, he would be destroying his entire future. Not only would he not become the new monarch of Egypt, but he would surely turn the whole of Egypt against him, becoming a wanderer and refugee, with no money or future.
Heroism is in no way better demonstrated than by one who can say no and then calmly accept the consequences of his resistance, knowing all too well that most of the time that heroic act will vanish into oblivion. Many a great man disappeared from the map of history because others were mediocre and could not grasp his message.
Yet, contrary to Moshe's expectations God reveals Himself to him at the burning bush, viewing him as the man suited to be the leader of the Jewish people. Had Moshe been educated by the best teachers in a warm Jewish environment, and protected from the influences of the outside world, he would not have become the extraordinary man he was. He would have remained in Pharaoh's palace, probably to become the next head of state in Egypt, but he would have left no legacy that would turn the word around.
What is completely surprising is that Moshe became the prototype of the ideal leader not in spite of being raised in a world of idol worship, self-worship, and total lack of morality, but because of it! He became the greatest Jewish leader ever, because it was his secular, polytheistic, and morally empty education that did the trick. It turned him into a fighter, determined to overthrow the false ideas he knew and recognized so well from the inside. It was the “rebel within” that made Moshe the leader of a nation whose function it is to fight and protest.
*****
One of the great tasks of Jewish education is to deliberately create an atmosphere of rebellion among its students. Rebellion, after all, is the great emancipator. We owe nearly all of our knowledge and achievements not to those who agreed but to those who differed. It is this virtue that brought Judaism into existence. Avraham was the first rebel, destroying idols, and he was followed by his children, then by Moshe, and then by the Jewish people.
What has been entirely forgotten is that the Torah was the first rebellious text to appear in world history. Its purpose was to protest. It set in motion a rebel movement of cosmic proportions the likes of which we have never known. The text includes all the radical heresies of the past, present and future. It called idol-worship an abomination, immorality an abhorrence, the worship of man a catastrophe. It protested against complacency, self-satisfaction, imitation, and the negation of the spirit. It called for radical thinking and drastic action, without compromise, even when it meant standing alone, being condemned and ridiculed.
All of this seems to be entirely lost on our religious establishment. We are instructing our students and children to obey, to fit in, to conform and not stand out. We teach them that their religious leaders are great people because they are “all-right-niks” who would never think of disturbing the established religious and social norms. We teach them that they are the ideal to be emulated. By doing so, we turn our backs on authentic Judaism and convey the very opposite of what Judaism is meant to convey.
By using clichés instead of the language of opposition, we deny our students the excitement of being Jewish: excitement resulting from the realization that one makes a huge difference and takes pride in it, no matter the cost; excitement at the awareness that one is part of a great mission for which one is prepared to die, knowing that it will make the world a better place.
When we tell our children to eat kosher, we need to tell them that this is an act of disobedience against consumerism when human beings are prepared to eat anything as long as it tastes good. When we go to synagogue, it is a protest against man's arrogance in thinking that he can do it all himself. When couples observe the laws of family purity, it is a rebellion against the obsession with sex. The celebration of Shabbat must be presented as an enormous challenge to our contemporary world that believes our happiness depends on how much we produce.
As long as our religious teachers continue to teach Jewish texts as models of approval, instead of manifestations of protest against the mediocrity of our world, we will lose more of our young people to that very mediocrity.
Judaism is in its essence an act of dissent, not of consent. Dissent leads to renewal. It creates loyalty. It is the force through which the world is able to grow.
To forget this crucial element is to betray Judaism.

1. Shemoth 2:11.
Ars Technica's latest analysis of the worldwide game console market will look largely familiar to anyone who has been following our previous reports. Sony continues to slowly increase its majority share, while Microsoft holds relatively steady and the Wii U slides quickly into market obscurity.
Last week, all three major console manufacturers released their quarterly financial reports for the period ending in September. Sony once again reported the strongest console sale results, shipping four million consoles to stores during the three-month period, up from 3.3 million during the same time a year ago. Nintendo also saw its quarterly console shipments improve slightly from a very low base, up from 610,000 consoles last year to 720,000 consoles this year.
(We'll include the usual disclaimer about sales versus shipments here: while the two numbers aren't precisely equivalent, hardware units shipped to stores are usually sold through to consumers within four to six weeks, according to industry analysts. Most units shipped by the end of September have likely been cleared off store shelves by this point, having little impact on the relative console race. The terms are used interchangeably throughout this article.)
Determining sales information for the Xbox One was harder than ever this quarter, as Microsoft didn't break out shipment numbers for the Xbox One or the Xbox family as a whole in its latest report. The only hint about the company's console sales came in an off-hand sentence saying that "Xbox hardware revenue decreased 17 percent, mainly due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold."
Last year, Microsoft sold 2.5 million Xbox systems in the third calendar quarter, and we estimated that anywhere from 1.44 to 1.8 million of those were Xbox One systems. We multiplied those numbers out based on the contemporary prices of the Xbox One and the Xbox 360 at the time (and some guesswork on the distribution of differently priced bundles) to get a range of roughly $809 to $874 million in Xbox hardware revenue for the period. Lop off 17 percent and you get $671 to $725 in hardware revenue for the third quarter of 2015.
Next, we had to split out the Xbox One revenue from the Xbox 360 revenue. Last year at this time, based on our estimates, the Xbox One was responsible for anywhere from 70 to 80 percent of all Xbox hardware revenue. But Microsoft said that this year's revenue drop was "mainly due to lower volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold." Given that and the increasing age of the Xbox 360, we estimated that the Xbox One is now responsible for 90 to 95 percent of all Xbox hardware revenue.
Divide all of that back out by the Xbox One's current sale price of $350, and you get 1.73 to 1.97 million systems sold for the quarter. That's a slight unit sales increase from a year ago despite the overall Xbox hardware revenue dip, made possible by cratering Xbox 360 sales and a price drop for the Xbox One. Our estimation method means this figure is a bit less solid than usual, but we're relatively confident it's in the right ballpark.
With those numbers in hand, we can see that Sony continues the slow but relentless erosion of the competition's positions in console market share. The PlayStation 4 now controls roughly 52 percent of the worldwide console market (Fig. 4) and enjoys its largest ever relative lead over the Xbox One in this market. Microsoft continues to sell enough systems to prevent Sony from having PlayStation 2-style dominance of the market, but it's not selling nearly enough to achieve anything close to parity.
Microsoft's sales aren't improving quickly enough
To see just how that increasing sales gap between the PS4 and the Xbox One plays out, it's useful to look at the year-to-year changes in both system's fates. For all intents and purposes, the end of the third quarter also ends the second full year of sales for both the Xbox One and PS4 (even though the first reporting "year" is closer to 11 months of actual sales, since both systems launched in North America in October). This means we can look at relative improvements in sales performance for both consoles smoothed out over an entire year rather than focusing on the sometimes jumpy quarterly numbers.
So which system showed the most improvement in its second year on store shelves? That depends on how you look at it. On a relative basis, Microsoft seemed to have the better year, with annual sales increasing over 25 percent compared to just a 17 percent increase for the PS4 (Fig. 5). But the PS4 was starting at a much higher base of 13.5 million sales in its first 11 months compared to about 7.2 million sales for the Xbox One in the same period.
The result (Fig. 6) is that the PlayStation 4 actually outsold the Xbox One by a slightly larger margin in its second year (6.8 million more console shipments than Xbox One) than it did in its first (6.33 million more console shipments than Xbox One). In other words, while the Xbox One is increasing its sales at a faster rate than the PS4, Microsoft still lost more ground to Sony this year than last on an absolute basis.
Of course, if current annual sales rate increases continue, the Xbox One would eventually overtake the PS4 in the annual sales race. However, that process would take quite a while. Fig. 7 above shows just how long, projecting out how annual sales would look if the PS4 continued to increase annual sales by about 17 percent a year and the Xbox One continued to improve at about 25.5 percent annually.
It's important to note that console sales patterns decidedly dowork in this way, and it's a bit ridiculous to expect annual sales to continue increasing in this kind of parabolic curve. Still, it's interesting to see that based on current trends, the Xbox One wouldn't start to outsell the PS4 on an annual basis until 2024. At that point, Sony would have continued building up a significant life-to-date lead of over 50 million consoles worldwide before Microsoft would be able to stop the bleeding (Fig. 8).
The takeaway from this hypothetical is clear: Xbox One sales need to improve at a faster rate (or PS4 sales need to start slowing down significantly) if Microsoft wants to have any hope of pulling even with Sony's sales in this console generation. Xbox Division Chief Phil Spencer might say that Microsoft isn't that concerned with the Xbox One's relative market share, but for anyone who is, the road ahead continues to look difficult.
Congress Denies Jeff Sessions Funding To Fight Marijuana Laws
The congressional budget bill, expected to pass this week, bars the Justice Department from spending any money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws, dealing a blow to the Trump Administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who seemed eager to push back on the growing acceptance of marijuana use throughout the country.
The bill includes a provision known as the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, which forbids any funds to be used to go after state medical marijuana laws. The amendment has been included on every budget since 2014, and this budget will extend state protections through the end of September.
The amendment reads:
“None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to any of the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, or with respect to the District of Columbia, Guam, or Puerto Rico, to prevent any of them from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.”
However, The Denver Channel points out that six states—Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota—are not included on the list of protected entities. The channel reached out to budget writers and the Department of Justice to find out why these states were omitted, but did not receive a response. Of those states, North Dakota and Indiana have medical marijuana laws.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a hardline stance on marijuana and has insinuated that he may go after states that have legalized medical or recreational marijuana.
“States, they can pass the laws they choose,” Sessions said during a February Justice Department press briefing. “I would just say it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not.”
Proponents of medical marijuana praised the inclusion of the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment.
“Medical cannabis patients in the U.S. can rest easy knowing they won't have to return to the black market to acquire their medicine,” Jeffrey Zucker, president of Green Lion Partners, a cannabis business strategy firm, told The Huffington Post. “Operators can relax a bit knowing their hard work isn't for naught and their employees' jobs are safe.”
The budget amendment gives no protection for the eight states and Washington, D.C. that have passed recreational marijuana laws.

Some recent polls show a decline in President Donald Trump's approval rating while others show little change. | AP Photo Trump suffers month of rough polling
The Obamacare repeal debacle has eroded Donald Trump's already weak approval ratings, leaving him historically unpopular just 10 weeks into his presidency.
A comparison of polls conducted before and after House GOP leaders pulled the bill to repeal parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act suggests Trump has suffered only a slight downtick over the past week. But the attrition culminates a month in which perceptions of the president have notably worsened.
Story Continued Below
Over the past week, six pollsters have released surveys conducted after the failure of the GOP health care bill. And while some show a decline in Trump's approval rating and others show little change, one thing remains consistent across all of the surveys — more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump. None of the polls shows any improvement in perceptions of the president.
Trump's latest approval ratings range between 38 percent and 46 percent. Fifty percent or more of respondents in each of the polls disapprove of his performance.
The president's lowest approval rating comes from the Gallup Daily Tracking survey . In interviews conducted Monday-Wednesday, 38 percent of Americans approved of Trump's job performance, while 57 percent disapproved.
Gallup has generally been more negative for Trump than other public polls. His approval rating dipped as low as 35 percent in the tracking survey earlier this week — down from 41 percent immediately before the health care bill died.
The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll has featured some of the most positive results for Trump, and the president's 46-percent approval rating in this week's survey is the highest recorded by any pollster since Trump and Republicans fell short on health care. But even that number reflects a slide of 4 percentage points from the previous week, down from 50 percent.
Trump's approval rating also declined 3 points from earlier this month in an automated-phone survey from the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling .
In SurveyMonkey's polling around the health care legislation's rollout, Trump held steady at 42 percent. But he is in a longer-term decline. Even Rasmussen Reports , the Republican-friendly automated polling firm, shows a decline for Trump over time, though little change from last week.
All in all, March has been a month the administration might just as soon want to forget. On March 1, Trump's average approval rating stood at 45 percent, according to HuffPost Pollster , with 50 percent disapproval. By Thursday afternoon, the numbers were down to 40 percent approve, versus 55 percent disapprove.

The RealClearPolitics average shows a similar movement in the wrong direction: On March 1, Trump was at 43 percent approve versus 50 percent disapprove. As of Thursday, his average approval rating had ticked down to 41 percent, compared to 53 percent disapproval.
Beyond Trump's approval ratings, there are other red flags for his presidency, as it shifts its focus to confirming Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and other legislative priorities, like an overhaul of the U.S. tax code.
In the CBS News poll, only 42 percent of Americans say they are confident in Trump's ability to make deals with Congress to pass legislation, while 54 percent are not confident. And only 32 percent of Americans approve of how Trump is handling health care, versus 59 percent who disapprove.
In the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, voters in the latest survey trust congressional Democrats over Republicans when it comes to dealing with health care, 45 percent to 35 percent. Two weeks ago, Republicans actually held a narrow advantage on the issue: 43 percent to 39 percent.
While Trump's ratings are historically poor for a new president, there are examples of presidents recovering in their first year. Bill Clinton's approval ratings bottomed out in the high 30s in June 1993, only to recover into the 50s when the summer ended in September. And Trump's approval ratings on the economy remain higher than his scores overall or on other, more controversial issues.
Americans are also still relatively hopeful about the future of the country. Despite poor views of Trump's job performance, 53 percent of Americans surveyed by CBS News say they are optimistic about the next four years with Trump as president, more than the 42 percent who say they are pessimistic.
Image copyright Hever Castle Image caption How the bed came to be in the attic of the Redland House Hotel in Chester is unknown
A 500-year-old bed left in a hotel car park once belonged to Welsh-born King Henry VII, it has been claimed.
The four poster, which it is suggested could be worth £20m, was left outside a hotel in Chester during a renovation before being collected by auctioneers.
Ian Coulson bought the bed at auction for £2,200 after spotting it online.
He then contacted TV historian Dr Jonathan Foyle who, following DNA testing, confirmed that the bed once belonged to the Pembroke-born monarch.
Dr Foyle described the artefact as "a complete national treasure".
He said: "It is specifically the marriage bed for Henry and Elizabeth."
The ornately carved four poster is currently on display at Hever Castle in Kent.
As a way to say thank you to the community for helping us make Heroes of the Storm the best game it can possibly be throughout its Alpha and Beta phases thus far, we'll soon be trying out a new method for sharing Closed Beta testing invitations, which will allow existing players to bring a few of their friends into the Nexus.
Essentially, a number of players will receive an email containing four Heroes of the Storm Beta Keys, which they can then give out to their friends and start brawling as a team. Initially, we're going to send these Beta Keys out to a rather small group of playtesters. If everything goes smoothly with this trial run, we will expand this program to include many additional players over the weeks to come.
It's important to note, however, that this will not replace our existing Closed Beta invite waves, which we're still sending out regularly. If you do not already have Beta access, make sure you've opted in to Heroes Beta testing on the Beta Profile Settings page in Battle.net Account Management. If you'd prefer not to wait for an invitation, you can purchase a Founder's Pack to gain immediate entry into the Heroes of the Storm Closed Beta.
If you're currently participating in Closed Beta testing, you may wish to keep an eye on the email address associated with your Battle.net account over the coming weeks to find out if you've received invite codes. We hope that many of you who receive these invitations will enjoy playing Heroes of the Storm even more after introducing your friends to the game, and we hope that you'll keep sharing your feedback with us as Beta testing continues.
Thank you very much!
Despite Boris' pronouncements, almost one in five Londoners do not earn enough to afford a decent quality of life
In the run up to the General Election, every few weeks Left Foot Forward will take a look back at the coalition's record on a specific policy area. This week we focus on low pay, and each day we will feature a piece that looks back at the impact of coalition policies on in-work poverty over the past five years. The following is from Jenny Jones, Green Party member and deputy chair of the Policing & Crime Committee
London's streets are paved with gold, but an increasing number of Londoners are living on credit. I grew up in the 1950s being taught that debt was to be avoided if possible. My parents heard distressing stories of the workhouse and debtors' prisons. Today's working poor would probably recognise some of those stories.
I've heard it said too often that London has been an economic success story under this mayor and government, with a booming jobs market and high rates of growth. This may be true, but it shows the poverty of these measures of success when they can conceal such desperate income poverty and inequality.
Average pay was still eight per cent lower in 2014 compared to 2008, when adjusted for inflation, and the minimum wage has fallen further and further behind the London Living Wage. The national minimum rate now leaves low paid workers up to £2.65 per hour below the amount they need to build a life on, and too many below even that as minimum wage enforcement remains a big problem.
The mayor has certainly talked up the London Living Wage, and the campaigners – with a little help from his office – have had a lot of success in getting large employers to sign up on a voluntary basis.
But there are many more people earning less than the London Living Wage today than when he came into office – the GLA estimates the number to have risen from 569,000 in 2008 to 917,000 in 2014. That's almost one in five working Londoners not earning enough to afford a very basic quality of life, and even this wage rate leaves you relying on tax credits and housing benefit.
Without those in-work benefits, you would need to be paid £11.67 per hour just to scrape by in London. Yet the national minimum wage is just £6.50 per hour, and for young adults a miserly £5.13 per hour.
Then there are those struggling on zero hour contracts or in self-employment, or worse still putting in 30 hours a week without pay on counter-productive workfare schemes. The mayor and this government co-funded a workfare pilot in London that halved the participants' likelihood of finding work. One in 10 participants were sanctioned, mostly for refusing to participate, which also meant they lost access to Jobcentre training services.
Try scraping by on this low wage, insecure job market while paying sky-high rents and dealing with bus fares that have gone up by a fifth in real terms. Add to that the punitive array of service cuts imposed by austerity government and councils, and the cruel cuts to council tax benefit, and it's no wonder that half a million Londoners are now facing problem debts, as an investigation of the London Assembly's Economy Committee which I chaired recently found.
Poverty is not just about income, but the low wage economy in London makes it inevitable. One million Londoners desperately need a government and mayor with a completely different economic strategy.

BoxingScene.com has been advised by promoter Gary Shaw that a deal has been finalized to merge his company, Gary Shaw Productions, with the boxing division of Roc Nation Sports, a sports management and promotional company which was founded by rapper Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter in 2013.
Shaw, who founded his company in 2002 after a lengthy stay with Main Events, will head Roc Nation's boxing division.
Roc Nation Sports—which announced its intentions to enter the boxing market in 2013—will stage their first event on Friday night from the Madison Square Garden Theater in New York City. Fox Sports 1 will televise.
"I'm proud that I'm with Roc Nation officially. I've brought over all of my employees, my fighters. I'm a big step for me personally and for GSP. Roc Nation is going to bring more exposure than any other promotional company to any fighter," Shaw told BoxingScene.com.
Some of Shaw's fighters include Bryant Jennings, Daniel Geale, Jose Pedraza,
Jhonatan Romero, Thomas Dulorme, Luis Del Valle, Laudelino Barros, Darley Perez, Victor Fonseca, Marvin Qintero, Art Hovhannisyan, Kimbo Slice, Tureano Johnson and others.
Pedraza's promotional situation is more unique than the others, as he is also co-promoted by DiBella Entertainment and Universal Promotions. Shaw plans to relinquish his shares of Pedraza's contract to Roc Nation, but such a move would require the approval of all parties involved, otherwise he would have to buy out his portion of the contract.
At the moment, matchmaker Eric Bottjer is assisting Roc Nation Sports. Shaw states that his company will hire and announce a head matchmaker in the coming weeks.
MORE DETAILS TO COME...............
BANGKOK, Thailand — After killing and enslaving ethnic minorities, illegally pursuing nuclear weapons and rigging a parliamentary election, Burma's ruling junta could use some positive attention.
The pending release of Aung San Suu Kyi, a revered icon of Burma's democracy struggle, could offer just that. Elected prime minister in 1990, but denied her title and confined off-and-on ever since, the Nobel Peace Laureate is considered a Gandhi-caliber icon.
The U.S., the United Nations and even Burma's censure-shy neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have all insisted on her release from 15 years of house arrest.
But few believe Suu Kyi, now 65, will be allowed to lead a movement posing any threat to the junta. Her political party has been disbanded. Unlike Burma's ethnic groups, which fend off the junta with guerrilla armies, Suu Kyi's followers are weaponless.
“If they're going to release her, that means the generals are quite confident they've secured the vote and feel they can control her,” said Aung Zaw, a Burmese exile and founder of The Irrawaddy magazine on Burma affairs. “Even the new generation of army leaders isn't going to negotiate with her.”
Though Suu Kyi's faithful are giddy over her possible freedom, pro-democracy groups such as Burma Campaign U.K. warn her release may be a shrewd bid for positive publicity in the wake of a Nov. 7 election widely considered fraudulent.
Some within the resistance fear the fanfare of Suu Kyi's release will distract from Burma's deeper problems and relax pressure on the junta. Secret monitors are still sorting out facts from the election, which officially recorded 80 percent of voters choosing the military's proxy party.
Some Suu Kyi allies inside Burma are openly questioning her role, a taboo within the pro-democracy movement.
“We are neither her subservient followers nor her personal worshippers,” said Khin Maung Swe, head of the new political party National Democratic Force, to the Irrawaddy.
The party largely consists of former members of Suu Kyi's party who left to compete in the election rather than backing a boycott.
While dismissing her hardline followers as a “personality cult,” Maung Swe is adamant that Suu Kyi is the “leader of the Burmese people” and even offered to disband his party if she desired. (The party won only about 3 percent of available parliamentary seats.)
Inside Burma, where news reports are limited to pro-junta propaganda, Suu Kyi's profile has suffered from her combined 15 years of confinement. Those born after her 1990 election are unlikely to know the full details of her mistreatment, even though her supporters have struggled to keep her name alive.
“We'll be interested to see how this young generation reacts to her release,” Aung Zaw said. “They still talk about her, some call her ‘Auntie Suu,' but there are some questions about her relevancy and popularity.”
Suu Kyi's freedom will be subject to the whims of Burma's junta, which last convicted her of crimes stemming from a fanatical U.S. Mormon's intrusion onto her property in 2009.
Her safety is equally uncertain. An armed attack on her convoy in 2003, during a short-lived release, was officially reported as a civilian riot. Human rights groups believe it was actually a junta-ordered assassination attempt.
Even Suu Kyi herself has at times dampened expectations of her power to change Burma if freed. “My release should not be looked at as a major breakthrough for democracy,” she said said prior to her last release in 2002. “For all people in Burma to enjoy basic freedom? That would be the major breakthrough.”
In this review, we are going to take a close look at an ARKit first-person shooter game called W.AR. W.AR (stands for Walkers Augmented Reality) isn't an ordinary Augmented Reality game. In fact, it's completely different than any other game that I've played before and you'll soon understand what exactly.
What is W.AR and What Makes it so Unique?
W.AR is an ARKit first-person shooter (FPS) in Augmented Reality. In this game, the players need to survive endless waves of zombie attacks. The player needs to locate weapons scattered around the garden and use them to kill the zombies. The gameplay will remind some of you the game Left4Dead or the Zombie mode in Call of Duty.
Before we move on talking more about this game, and I have a lot to share with you, let's take a look at some gameplay footage.
The developer bought the classic realistic FPS gameplay to AR. OK, I know, there are many other AR FPS games out there, so you might ask, what makes W.AR so unique?
Well, this game was designed from the ground up for outdoor gameplay. The game spawns a life-size gaming map onto the real world. I didn't count steps, but I get this map is like 30 by 30 meters (98.5 by 98.5 ft) in size, no kidding, it's a very large map.
It kind of funny because I first tried playing it inside my apartment. I laughed at myself a few seconds later by just even thinking of trying it. The second time I went downstairs to the street trying to see if it can play it there, but nope, I need much more space.
After that, I took a ride to the nearby park. This is the only place I could actually play this game as the developer intended it to be played. W.AR requires constant movement. Once those zombies start attacking, they come from all angles. The longer you survive, the higher their numbers become. You can't just stand in place and think you can take them all down, you just can't, you need to run from them. I've found out that even the size of the virtual base area isn't enough, you need some extra space to run away from the zombies. I was going like even 20 meters outside of the base area in order to avoid getting hit by the zombies. I did like a long circular turn and then got back to the base to pick up another weapon.
W.AR gives you three weapons to shoot with, an assault rifle, a grenade, and a pistol. In the game's screenshot on iTunes, I saw a pump-action shotgun but I wasn't able to find it so there might be more weapons. Furthermore, I saw a video where the player picks up a grenade from the floor, I didn't find one either so maybe I just missed it.
Update: after checking the gameplay video, I clearly see that there were grenades on the floor but I didn't pay attention to them while playing.
The game remembers your highest score and you can view the highscore leaderboard and see how long you played and what's the highest score you achieved and that particular match.
A Full-scale Battlefield Map in AR
W.AR puts you in a battle zone. Once the game starts you hear an alarm and then you need to get ready to shoot some zombies. The map includes several sheds, fences and a guard tower. There are also some virtual trees and other objects around the scene.
It's amazing that such a simple map design looks so amazing when you spawn in in the real world. Suddenly the park really looked like a protects based. The trees and the fence help to create that closed base area and make the scene look extremely realistic.
It's the first time I've experienced an AR game on such a large scale. Obviously, this game isn't for everyone because to enjoy playing it, you really need to play in a very large open space. Now how many of you would go to the park just to be able to play again, not many of you I suppose. Of course, if you are already there you can give it a try. Don't get me wrong, you can still play it even a small place, but you probably won't be able to move to reach the table where the gun is and run away from the zombies.
W.AR is probably the most realistic first-person shooter you ever played. The entire scene is the real-world scene so it can't get more ultra-realistic than that. The added virtual objects are just for decoration, to create the feeling like you are inside a base.
Overall, the entire map looked nice in AR. Obviously, this is not a very practical setting for an AR game, at least not if you want to reach a broad audience. If I wasn't reviewing this game, I would probably wouldn't have played it at all, unless I am already in a park with friends and want to try it out.
I have to admit, the gameplay was fun. The problem is that although you can see the real world on the screen, it's not that safe to play in a large area because you can't see what happens underneath near you fit. I certainly wouldn't recommend running while playing this game. If you do play this game, it's better to play it in a large open area far away from roads, obstacles, people, etc.
By the way, when you launch the game, there is a link to a YouTube video. In the video's description, there is a link to a Unity 3D tutorial for this app on udemy.com. So it seems like this game was also developed to promote that course or whatever this tutorial is.
Gameplay Experience
W.AR lacks a lot of features that could have made it so much better like better visuals, a larger selection of weapons (I want to be able to shoot with rocket launcher and a machine gun!), hiding spots, ability to aim down the sight, a better grenade throwing animation, weapon reload option, more subtle incremental difficulty (in just two minutes you find yourself dealing with hundreds or zombies), different maps to explore, a progression system, a larger variety of zombies, better-looking zombie 3D modes, etc.
That being said, I think this is the first iOS AR game that I've seen that dares to try out this large-scale Augmented Reality experience. The FPS genre is an excellent choice and the gameplay experience was intensive, engaging and most importantly fun. It doesn't mean that I will go to the park playing this game every day, of course not. However, W.AR is a good demonstration of how a large-scale battlefield game looks and plays in Augmented Reality (AR). I still think that there should be an option to select the size of the map so people can play this game in smaller areas and add a separated highscore leaderboard for each one.
I have no doubt that this game could have been much more engaging with AR glasses and a dedicated gun accessory, even better as a co-op game. I'm sure that this game will inspire other developers to develop large-scale ARKit games.
I've played quite a lot of zombie shooters last month, including Dead Lands AR zombies, Zombies! ARgh!, Angry Zombies, Zombie gunship Revenant AR and ARZombi. When I played ARZombi and Dead Lands AR Zombie, I did feel that those shooters are meant to be played in a large space. I really didn't enjoy playing them in a tight space. So if you are already developed a game that requires a large space, why not go all-in, and that's what the developer of W.AR Augmented Reality did. I didn't like seeing zombie spawning in the air. The reason for that because ARKit doesn't recognize vertical surfaces and therefore it cannot limit the gameplay area to the inner boundaries of the game. This made the game looks funny. The same goes for W.AR, but because I played it in the park, I didn't experience any of this “floating” appearance of the virtual 3D models.
Overall, a really fun experience, especially when you experience a game like this in AR for the first time.
Graphics & Sound Effects
The graphics quality is not impressive at all. However, because you are usually located far from the 3D objects, you don't really notice the low-poly model and the low-res textures. The trees are far away and blend in nicely with the environment, regardless of the low graphics quality. I didn't even pay attention to the graphics quality of the trees, only when I came home and view the screenshot.
The same goes for the zombie characters, they just look very blend, grayish and you can easily see the low texture quality when they are very close to you.
The visual effects are nice though, not spectacular but OK. I especially liked the shooting and the explosion visual effects. The same goes for the sound effects, they are pretty good and make the shooting experience feel quite authentic.
There is certainly a large room for improvements in both the visual and sound departments. I think that the developer kept the visual quality low so that the game can run in acceptable frame rates as more zombies spawn in. You can check out the gameplay video yourself. You can see that after a few minutes, there are already hundreds of zombies on the screen. I think that higher quality 3D models could have lead to significant drop in frame rates.
I've noticed that the 3D models do have shadows and this made the experience more authentic. In fact, I played in an open area without trees close by, but when you look at the floor you can see lots of shadows. Those are the shadows from the virtual trees. I actually felt like I am in a shady area and this help to produce a better sense of authenticity of to the virtual scene.
Before we ramp things up. I want to add this game is not optimized for the iPad and you get a black frame when you play it. Furthermore, the game had a bug that when you pick up the same gun the second time after your magazine is empty you cannot shoot with it. I hope this will be addressed in a future update.
Conclusion
W.AR is a great example of how a realistic, large-scale, room-scale experience in AR looks and plays like. I see very few users playing a game like this because of the large gameplay area requirement. The game's map is not resizeable either.
The Shooting experience was fun and intensive. However, the gameplay area requirement just makes this game impractical for many users.
The gameplay is still fun and addictive. I think it's the first time that I actually felt like how amazing it will be if I could play and ARKit game with AR glasses.
I do recommend downloading this game and trying it out. I personally wouldn't go to the park especially to play this game, but if I am already in a large open area, I would definitely try playing it again and see if I can beat my own previous highscore.

The numbers are far from finalized at this point, but voters showed up in droves at the polls on Election Day in Alberta, posting the strongest showing in decades in the province.
Early estimates show that 59 percent of eligible voters cast their ballot, which is a huge improvement from the 50.9 percent average across the last six elections.
While it didn't break the 60 percent mark, that saw Ralph Klein elected premier in 1993, it sure did come close.
Advance polling numbers factored in quite a bit this time around as well, with voter turnout at advance polls coming in at 30 percent higher than in 2012.
Approximately 235,000 people cast their ballots in advanced voting, breaking a record that had just been set.
179,820 voters cast their ballots in advance polls in 2012.
Don Martin, with CTV's Power Play, says that with such high voter turnouts, it usually means a revolutionary decision is on the way.
"Ralph Klein's Miracle on the Prairie election in 1993, a voter gamble over what was expected to be a strong Liberal challenge, set the bar at its highest level. Last night, as Rachel Notley's orange mop swished away the Progressive Conservative dynasty, that record was very nearly beaten. Big turnout means big problems for the status quo."
Martin says that voters will show up in record numbers when it's clear that they want their voice to be heard.
"Last night, the voter turnout medium became a message wrapped in a PC pink slip."
As for the seat breakdown in Alberta following last night's historic win:
NDP – 53
Wildrose Party – 21 (Official opposition)
PC – 10
Liberal – 1
Alberta Party – 1

The Washington Redskins on Sunday meet the New England Patriots for the ninth time in the history of the franchises. Washington owns a 6-2 record against New England, but the last time the teams faced off, the Patriots handed the Redskins a 52-7 thrashing in Foxborough.
Under normal circumstances, the Redskins would have a tough time keeping up with the Patriots. New England this season has scored 41 touchdowns. Washington, meanwhile, has mustered only 19 all year. And now the going gets tougher for the Redskins, who are without top playmaker Fred Davis and left tackle Trent Williams.
“I wouldn't say it's more pressure, but it's definitely going to be tough to go out there and get a win,” cornerback DeAngelo Hall says. “But the guys in this locker room, we're not going to quit. We're going to go out there and fight to get a win.”
Here are some key matchups for this game:
WSH cornerbacks vs. NE wide receiver Wes Welker
Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan, defensive coordinator Jim Haslett and Hall all call Welker the best route-runner in the NFL. That's a big reason why Welker leads the league both in catches (93) and receiving yards (1,253) and has eight touchdowns despite being only 5-foot-9. He lines up in the slot much of the time, so while Hall may find himself matched up with Welker some, a lot of the responsibility of covering him likely will fall on Kevin Barnes. The Redskins occasionally have put fellow corner Josh Wilson on the opponent's slot receiver, however, and put Barnes on the outside. It will take a collective effort to limit Welker.
WSH tackles Sean Locklear/Willie Smith vs. NE defensive end Andre Carter
The Redskins haven't yet announced Trent Williams' replacement, but it will be either eight-year veteran Sean Locklear, who started two games this season at that spot with Williams injured, or Smith — an undrafted rookie, who boasts good athleticism and size. Carter, who spent the last five seasons with the Redskins, has revived his career after signing with New England this offseason and boasts nine sacks. He had a four-sack game against the Jets this season. Carter has long arms, great strength and explosion off the edge. Locklear or Smith must try to fend him off to give Rex Grossman time to throw.
WSH safeties Oshiomogho Atogwe, Reed Doughty vs. NE tight end Rob Gronkowski
The Redskins could be without strong safety LaRon Landry for a second straight game (groin strain), so they'll rely heavily on Atogwe, Doughty and rookie DeJon Gomes, to try to limit Gronkowski, who leads the NFL with 13 touchdown catches. The 6-foot-6, 256-pound tight end also ranks seventh in the league with 65 catches and ninth in the NFL with 928 receiving yards. Washington's linebackers aren't strong in coverage, so the safeties will have to help over the top. The Redskins don't have anyone in their secondary that has even close to the type of size that Gronkowski boasts, so Shanahan said the defensive backs will have to use their athleticism and leaping ability to try to combat Brady's favorite red zone target.
WSH running back Roy Helu vs. NE middle linebacker Brandon Spikes
The Redskins will need another well-rounded effort from their rookie running back, who averages 4.7 yards a carry (15th in the NFL) and leads all rookie running backs with 42 receptions (third overall among NFL rookies). Washington's offense runs best when the Redskins can put together a balanced attack that features runs from Helu and play-action passes. The Redskins in the last two weeks have started games with strong execution and game-opening touchdown drives. They couldn't sustain that effectiveness against the Jets, however. But if Spikes and his fellow defenders can take away the run and put Washington in an early hole, it could be a long day.
WSH wide receiver Santana Moss vs. NE cornerback Kyle Arrington
Santana Moss hasn't had the impact that he has had in years past for the Redskins. Part of that has to do with the four-week injury absence, and part of it has to do with the fact that teams are able to concentrate on shutting him down because the Redskins have few threats outside of Moss. Moss (averaging a career-low 10.9 yards per catch) needs to have a big game for the Redskins to help boost their struggling offense, which now is missing Davis (59 catches, 796 yards, three touchdowns). Arrington leads the NFL with seven interceptions and will likely match up with Moss often. Jabar Gaffney (46 catches, 665 yards, three touchdowns) also needs to have an effective game for the Redskins as he faces his former team, the Patriots.

Jimmy Kimmel is learning that there are consequences to getting political — even if it's for a worthy cause.
Ever since the late-night show host began crusading against the effort by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there have been “incidents with Trump supporters” that have forced him to increase security at his show tapings.
Want to see editorial cartoons on the topic?
Follow us on Flipboard.
Sources close “Jimmy Kimmel Live” tell the website The Blast that the comedian has had some issues with protestors who don't appreciate his criticism of Trump and his support of Obamacare. In response to protesters, the show has increased personnel at both the front and back entrances. This personnel consists of highly-trained, off-duty police officers.
In addition to the protesters, several “concerning” emails and letters have also been sent to the production, The Blast said.
A representative for the show has yet to comment on the report.
Salon notes that Kimmel's campaign against GOP health care proposals may have struck conservatives as particularly jarring given that he hasn't been previously known for advocating progressive causes.
Such advocacy has been the domain of Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah, while Kimmel's humor has been defined as known as more apolitical and “everyman,” Salon said.

In fact, he flouts political correctness, has boasted of his nonpartisanship, and he uses his “dudebro” humor to tease groups that are some of the favorite targets of conservatives, including the Hollywood elite.
A 2015 survey commissioned by The Hollywood Reporter, and cited by Salon, showed that Kimmel's fans split evenly between Democrats and Republicans. “If you had to declare one host the quasi-conservative in the left-leaning late-night landscape, it would have to be Kimmel,” Salon said.
Kimmel decided to get political in his monologues after his son, Billy, was born this spring with a rare congenital heart defect and needed emergency surgery. Kimmel noted that his son now had a pre-existing condition that wouldn't necessarily be covered under GOP proposals.

In the midst of the GOP's third push for Obamacare repeal, Kimmel said, “By the way, before you post a nasty Facebook message saying I'm politicizing my son's health problems, I want you to know, I am politicizing my son's health problems.”
Kimmel's campaign to save the Affordable Care Act was arguably decisive in the ongoing debate, encouraging millions of people around the country to contact their representatives in Congress, Salon said.
But it may also have been decisive in alienating some of his conservative viewers, with Salon saying that “Jimmy Kimmel Live” had 2.04 million viewers last week during the heart of his health care fight, a 5 percent drop from his average.
I certainly shared your optimism initially. However, when you find 'Researchers' whom you alert to a fallacy or factual error first arguing the toss, then accepting defeat, but then printing their flawed polemic anyway, you understand that this isn' a genuine Scientific Research Program. It's just self-promotion or academic careerism.
I suppose the same thing could be said of virtually everything Philosophers pretend to talk about.
At one time, I suppose, one could say A.I mavens were equally deaf to constructive criticism. That's changed.
I recall a few years back a young engineer in India claimed to have solved the P equals NP thing. He hadn't, but what was heartening was the way everybody was prepared to pay attention and keep an open mind.
There have been long running 'dialogues of the deaf' in Math- e.g. Brouwer's intuitionism vs Godel's Platonism- but that stuff ends with useful things. Turing used Brouwer choice sequences to illuminate a result from Godel. Since then, the pace of what Grothendieck calls 'Yoga'- i.e. the unification of discrete branches of mathematics on the basis of greater generality has speeded up as has the use of 'machine intelligence' in producing proofs.
We are beginning to understand that Maths itself might have a univocal ethos. Except, a real smart dude like Terence Tao, would see the opposite- Maths is like Walt Whitman's America, or Borges's India- it contradicts itself because it is bigger than the world.
A few years ago, I loved Gladwell type articles which made STEM stuff sexy and read like a thriller. But, the real time story- which we can all get a glimpse off on our smartphones though stuck in brain dead professions- is just so much more exciting.
Haemsturhuis spoke of Beauty as being that which is most productive of new ideas. I think we've reached a point now where we are reacting not to the ethics of a.i's- like Microsoft's teen-girl chatbot which turned into a Hitler loving sex freak- but some gestalt type aesthetic involving a Spinozan univocity within which our own individual life-projects are subsumed.
Dear God, did I just write this gush? Yup. At least I'm not getting paid for it, which is why I won't do it again.
Don't pay philosophers, or football players or plumbers come to that, for writing worthless gush otherwise the day may come when that's all they do.
His career sidetracked by an alcohol problem, Erin Henderson believes the door is open for a return to the Vikings.
The linebacker played for Minnesota the past six years, the past three as a starter. But he was released Feb. 7, shortly after his second drunken driving arrest in 1-1/2 months.
“I completely understood where the organization was coming from and what they needed to do for themselves moving forward,” Henderson said in a phone interview Wednesday.
Henderson, though, said he met with Vikings general manager Rick Spielman shortly before he was let go, and Spielman told him “there was that window of opportunity” for him to return to the only NFL team he has known.
Henderson said Spielman told him that “if I can continue to take care of myself from what I need to take care of, then there's always a chance that I can get back up there. So the door was left open.”
A Vikings spokesperson said Spielman was unavailable for comment.
When Henderson, 27, last spoke to Spielman, he had just completed a 30-day program at a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center but had not resolved his legal problems. That changed this month, when he pleaded guilty in separate cases while having more serious charges dismissed. That could pave the way for Henderson, who has been working out in Los Angeles, to return to the NFL.
“That was something I wanted to take care of as soon as possible, and we were able to come up with something that worked for both sides,” Henderson said. “I'm looking forward to moving forward with my career. Having that legal burden lifted is definitely some weight off my shoulders. … I'll definitely be playing in (the NFL in 2014).”
Henderson faced two counts of fourth-degree driving while impaired, one count of careless driving and one count of possessing more than 1.4 grams of marijuana after being arrested Nov. 19 in Eden Prairie.
Eden Prairie prosecutor Jennifer Spalding said Henderson pleaded guilty May 6 to one count of careless driving. He received a $1,000 fine and one year of probation and must perform 40 hours of community service, which Henderson said he is setting up.
Henderson's second arrest was Jan. 1 after a single-car accident in Chanhassen. He was charged with second- and third-degree DWI, possession of marijuana, possession of paraphernalia and a violation of a special condition in his driver's license.
Chanhassen prosecutor Elliott Knetsch said Henderson pleaded guilty May 5 to fourth-degree DWI. He received a $1,000 fine and two years of probation while having to provide evidence of having completed rehabilitation.
On Jan. 2, the day Henderson was released from jail following his second arrest, he checked into Hazelden, a treatment center in the Twin Cities. He chronicled that experience in a first-person account he wrote last month for the website TMZ.com.
“It was tough at first, but you get adjusted to being there,” Henderson said Wednesday. “I wouldn't trade those 30 days for anything, to be able to better myself and do some soul searching. … I'm sober (now), but it's definitely an everyday battle. Every day is a struggle, but they say it's one day at a time, so that's how I'm taking it. But I'm enjoying the sober life; it's really not as bad as I thought.
“In a perfect world, I would say that I would never have another drink. Marijuana is not really a huge problem for me. I didn't smoke when I was in college (Maryland, 2004-07), and I've gone years at a time without messing with it, so I don't see that as much of an issue as it is with alcohol. Alcohol is always present and always around, so it's just one day at a time.”
Henderson said he has received plenty of support from Vikings players. He said he has had more spiritual awareness since wide receiver Greg Jennings visited him in Hazelden and “brought the word of God.” Linebacker Chad Greenway and safety Jamarca Sanford and former Vikings linebacker Marvin Mitchell also have reached out to him.
Henderson did not want to elaborate on how much he drank while with the Vikings, but he acknowledged it was sometimes evident to teammates and coaches that he was hung over during practice.
Did it affect his play?
“I'd been drinking my entire life, since I was 15 years old,” he said. “I've never really known what my body is like without alcohol, and that is something that I'm curious to see.”
Signed as an undrafted free agent in 2008, Henderson earned a starting position in 2011 and in 2013 signed a two-year deal that could have been worth more than $4 million. Being released potentially cost him more than $2 million.
“I'll be forever grateful to the Vikings for what they did for me and the different opportunities that they presented to me, but it was more so that I let my family down that bothered me more than anything,” said Henderson, whose brother, E.J. Henderson, was a Vikings linebacker from 2003-11.
Still, Henderson is hopeful his two arrests will end up being a “blessing in disguise” because he is sober and optimistic about a bright NFL future.
Henderson said he's in great shape but not close to signing with a team. One reason is uncertainty over possible NFL discipline, which could include a suspension.
“I think a lot of teams are hesitant right now because they don't really know what the league is going to do as far as punishment or anything,” Henderson said. “So that's the next step.
“I feel 100 percent healthy, no bumps or bruises. … With my body of work that I've done in this league, I'll definitely be playing in the league (next season). I think that outweighs the negative things that have come my way. But while some people might look at them as negatives, I think it's a blessing in disguise because you find out a little bit about yourself in the darkest times and the character about who you are.”

If you are living in a coastal area and are looking for an alternative home in case global warming causes sea levels to rise, you should consider these 11 countries with the highest average elevation. Even if both polar caps melt, people living in these areas will stay safe.
Aside from providing breathtaking landscape, living in countries with the highest elevation in the world has its more practical advantages. Currently, the lowest average elevation country is Maldives, with an average elevation of just 6 feet. If the sea rises just 3 feet (1 meter), 80% of the Maldives will be submerged in the Indian Ocean. People living in countries on our list don't have to fear that scenario.
When compiling the list of countries with the highest average elevation, we ran into some interesting tidbits. For instance, if the Tibet was independent, it would easily be number one on our list, with the average elevation of 16,000 feet (4900 m). On that altitude, air contains just 56% of oxygen compared to sea level. That means you need to breathe almost twice as much to inhale the same amount of oxygen. It also means that, due to changes in air pressure, it takes more than twice as long to boil an egg.
Greenland is another region we left out, due to not being an independent country. Its average altitude of 1,792 m (5,879 feet) would assure it a place on the list. Antarctica would also be placed high, if it were a country, with the average elevation of 2,300 m (7,546 feet).
Contrary to popular belief that living on higher altitudes improves one health, neither of the countries on the list is among the world's 15 healthiest countries. If you take a look at the elevation maps of the world, geographical locations of countries with the highest average altitude are easily guessed. Out of 11 countries, 7 are located in Asia, 2 in Africa and 1 each in Europe and South America. All of them are high above the world average elevation of 840 m (2,756 feet). Let's see which countries are high enough to earn a spot on among countries with the highest average elevation.

NATO has confirmed that crew members from a flotilla moored in Belfast are being investigated after a bridge was smashed up over the weekend.
The Lagan Weir bridge, that spans the river from Donegall Quay to Queen's Quay in Belfast city centre, was extensively damaged in an incident that appears to have occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Glass panels at the side of the footbridge were smashed as were spotlights embedded in its floor. It is estimated the cost of repairing the damage could run into thousands of pounds.
On Sunday, a spokesman for the NATO fleet, the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group One, Lt Cmdr Talis Dzerve, said he could “confirm crew members from the NATO group” are being questioned about the incident.

He added: “Representatives from our group are in close contact with the police regarding proceedings in this case. We are co-operating with the police, but as the case is proceeding we cannot comment any further at this time.”
Lt Cmdr Dzerve declined to comment on whose custody the sailors were in, however he described the alleged incident as “very unpleasant”.
In a separate statement, sent to Belfast Live from NATO headquarters, a spokesman also confirmed the allegation is being investigated.

They added: “We are aware of this incident and can confirm that crew members of one of the ships of the NATO standing group are cooperating with local authorities. Due to ongoing legal proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment further.”
Belfast Live understands that the incident was captured on CCTV overlooking the bridge. It is understood two individuals were seen in the vicinity of the incident and that some sort of implement, possibly a golf club, was used to smash the glass panels and lights. It is understood the incident occurred over a period of minutes and that police were alerted by a witness.
The footbridge was closed on Saturday while temporary repairs were carried out. The £5m footbridge was opened two years ago replacing an old footbridge which was used by 16,000 people each week.
Sources say that each of the panels smashed costs hundreds of pounds. The bridge was re-opened late on Saturday afternoon following the temporary repairs.
The Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1 (SNMCMG1) arrived in Belfast last week for a port visit as part of the group's 2017 deployment.
Over the last two weeks the ships of SNMCMG1, their crews and the command staff have participated in intense training during the United Kingdom's exercise Joint Warrior which took place in British waters North-East of Scotland.
On Tuesday, the PSNI confirmed they are investigating the incident.
A spokesman said: "Police officers on patrol in Belfast city centre at around 4am on 14 October arrested two men on suspicion of criminal damage after they noted damage to the Perspex panels on the Lagan Weir walkway.
"Both were released on bail pending further enquiries. Police enquiries are ongoing."
Also on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Department for Communities which has responsibility for the bridge said the "estimated repair bill to the bridge will be £7,500".

Another fine summer Sunday is upon us, and with it the accompanying global warming has swept in another open thread with some odds and ends that slipped through the cracks during the week. Off we go…
Nobody can visit Martha's Vineyard without coming away with the impression that the struggle is real. So, not unlike Hillary Clinton, Sen. Elizabeth Warren showed up at a Vineyard town hall to remind the marginalized and downtrodden that she's fighting on their behalf:
The headline is befitting somebody with Dances With Identity Fraud's resume, and the crowd roared in approval after Warren pledged to redistribute everybody's wealth except those who live on Martha's Vineyard.
After reminding the audience that “words matter” using a Trump example, Warren helped show why Dems will continue to lose by approaching the opposition like this:
“Every one of you knows somebody who lives in a state with a Republican senator . . . Urge them to get out, please. Urge them to go to the office, carry a sign. Urge them to make their voices heard, and make your voice heard. Pick up your phone, email, tweet, every part of this. We need the sound; we need your energy from the grassroots up. It's democracy.”
[…]
She said it is critical to speak with those who hold opposing views: “This is the moment, you've actually got to reach out and talk to your crazy uncle.”
Elizabeth Warren diagnosing somebody as crazy should be the new clinical definition of sanity.

Phil Donahue's memory in regards to the history of American politics seems to be less comprehensive than mine:
Former talk-show host Phil Donahue on Saturday reflected on President Trump's administration, calling it “the darkest political moment in American history.”
[…]
“He can shoot a gun down Fifth Avenue, right?” Donahue added, referencing Trump's past claim. “All of a sudden we got a crotch-grabber for a president.”
Bill Clinton unavailable for comment.

No words:
Jesse Watters debated a protester from ANTIFA, short for anti-fascism, a group calling for violence against the “Trump- Pence regime.” Kevin from the Boston ANTIFA branch penned an open letter on the anarchist site ItsGoingDown.org urging liberals and progressives to violence to take down President Trump.
[…]
“What about when an ANTIFA member stabbed a police horse in the neck with a knife,” Watters continued. “Was the horse a racist Trump supporter?” “Yes,” the protester said.
Talk about the ultimate dilemma for PETA.

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
Israel's moral claim to land comes from the Bible, not Google, Communications Minister Tzachi Hanegbi said in Washington on Tuesday at an event held in support of placing West Bank settlements within final borders of the Jewish state.
“Defense is important and security is important, but the most important thing is the moral claim of Israel. We are committed to go forward with living in our ancient land, land that was given us not by Google and Wikipedia, but by the Bible,” he said.
The event Hanegbi spoke at was hosted by the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea and Samaria to mark the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Six Day War, titled “Celebrate 50 Years of Rejuvenation in Judea and Samaria.” It was purposely held near the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual policy conference to attract those in attendance there.This was the first time the council held an event in Washington concurrent with the AIPAC conference to specifically target those attendees, as part of its growing focus on soliciting support abroad for the settlements, both in the United States and the European Union.Housing and Construction Minister Yoav Galant (Kulanu) said, “For us, Judea and Samaria is Israel,” adding that continued control of Area C of the West Bank was existentially necessary for Israel.“There is no way that Israel can exist” without the Jordan Valley and the mountaintops of Samaria, he said. “Of course, it is difficult to have a strong Jerusalem without [the settlements of] Givat Ze'ev, Ma'aleh Adumim and Gush Etzion and all these places.”Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said there were three quick arguments for placing Area C of the West Bank within Israel's borders, all of which centered around the word “just,” and then mentioned Israel's victory in the Six Day War.“It was a just war. It is a just defense. But the most important one, it was based on a just claim.A just claim of the Jewish people on [the Biblical areas of] Beit El, Shechem, Jerusalem and Hebron,” she said.“Let me tell you something, if those places are not Jewish, who can tell me that [the modern cities of] Herzliya, Rehovot, Rishon Lezion and Tel Aviv are Jewish,” Hotovely said. “I always say that the occupation is a myth, because we never occupied other people's land. This is Jewish land [Judea and Samaria]. This should forever be a Jewish land under Israeli law.”Area C of the West Bank is outside the boundaries of sovereign Israel, but is under IDF military and civilian rule. The Palestinians believe it will part of their future state.The event came as the Trump Administration is in the midst of attempting to break the three-year deadlock on the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.

SAMARRA, Iraq
At least 82 people were killed and 85 others were injured Monday in two separate attacks that targeted military facilities in western Iraq, police and military sources told Anadolu Agency.
An Iraqi police officer said 37 people were killed and 55 others were injured in a suicide attack in Anbar province.
The dead and injured were all members of the Iraqi security forces, including senior officers. The attack targeted the headquarters of the Third Brigade in north Fallujah.
“The explosive-laden army vehicle was an army personnel carrier,” the police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. "The explosion led to the destruction of 12 police vehicles and the destruction of large parts of the building. The attack led to large financial and human losses on the part of the Iraqi forces.”
Earlier in the day, at least 45 people were killed in a separate attack in western Iraq after a military tank exploded inside an army warehouse, military sources told the Anadolu Agency.
The sources also said more than 30 people were injured in the attack in Tharthara area, west of Samarra city.

Sir Albert and Sir Andrew were tied, with two points each. They raised their swords, touched blades for the ceremonial start and attacked.
Flashes of silver swooped through the air as the two armor-clad men jabbed, stabbed and poked their weapons at each other. The Great Hall was filled with the clanging of metal scraping metal. Andrew drove his sword low, toward his rival's pancreas. Albert reacted with an upward-sliding chest thrust. His 28-inch blade touched the chin of Andrew's helmet.
Point to Sir Albert, declared the judges.
The victor may have been smiling, though it was impossible to tell. Except for two narrow eye slits, his face was completely obscured by his headgear.
Sir Andrew removed his helmet and transformed back into Andrew Venezia. The 29-year-old student at the European Martial Arts Academy in Alexandria questioned the call, which seemed to contradict what he'd learned in class: that the point zone falls between the shoulders and th e waistline, and a thrust to the head or a blow to the hands or legs counts as a fault.

“He got me directly in the face. I was lunging and I heard my helmet rattle,” he said.
But the point stayed with Sir Albert.
In an official setting, Albert Thompson (history professor and academy co-owner) might have lost the winning point to Venezia (doctoral candidate in neuroscience at the University of Maryland). This, however, was a practice session for an upcoming performance here at John Strongbow's Tavern in Old Town, where entertainment would trump survival. And Sir Albert's more-dramatic strikes had caught the judges' eye. Of course, if the knights had been fighting on a 15th-century battlefield, the outcome could have been much worse than a miscall. One of them could be dead.
But apart from the ending, the swordplay on display faithfully hews to an original historical source: the illustrated fighting manuals of Hans Talhoffer, a German fencing master and instructor of the mid-1400s.
Thomas Booth, who founded EMAA and owns the tavern, frequently reminds his disciples that the fighting style is a true warrior art form.
“Swordsmanship isn't what you see in the movies. This isn't wild Conan stuff,” he informed a Wednesday-night class. To drive home the point, he raised his weapon high over his head like a lumberjack preparing to swing an ax and released a primal grunt. “It was designed for knights to fight in a full suit of armor.”
In the crowded arena of martial arts classes, Old World sparring techniques are generally eclipsed by more ethereal practices such as judo and jujitsu. But Booth is an ardent promoter and practitioner of Talhoffer's moves, which he describes as “the most deadly and effective mixed martial arts that I've ever seen in the world.”

As a former Army Special Forces serviceman (1980-88), Booth has a facility for fighting; as a history major at Yale (Class of 1991, cum laude), he knows the past. He whipped the two together for his first medieval-themed restaurant in Winston-Salem, N.C. To avoid the cartoonish swashbuckling often performed at period-piece shows, he researched authentic styles from the Middle Ages, back when knights were like Hell's Angels on horseback. He locked onto Talhoffer's texts, which had languished in obscurity for nearly 400 years. The first English translation appeared in 2000.
“We're not trying to historically re-create Talhoffer,” Booth said. “We're trying to show the historical importance of taking what was dead for 500 years and bringing it back to life.”
***
The academy, which opened in November, focuses on dagger, broadsword, sword and shield, two-handed broadsword, grappling, striking and crisis response. It teaches many — but not all — of the chapters in the book.
“Really, some of it is kind of silly,” Booth admitted.
For example, students who wish to learn “Fight Between Man and Woman” will have to look elsewhere. Booth will not show a woman how to throttle a man standing in a waist-high pit.
Many of the instructors, including Booth, perform at the weekend Medieval Madness dinner theater above John Strongbow's. Booth will also tag some of his standout students to fight in the spectacle — in full armor (from the waist up) and with real swords that can slice a frozen Yule log like pudding. Beyond the honor of appearing onstage, the winner takes home a pocketful of cash. (Booth throws in some seed money and diners add to the pot. On a recent Friday night, it added up to $168.)
“I've never been in a live sword fight,” said Venezia, who was selected for the show in January after only a few weeks of training. “I'm very surprised and a little nervous.”
In the Beginning Sword Combat class, the risk of getting cut or punctured is low. Participants practice with plastic swords and wear nonmetallic workout clothes. The biggest fear is probably agitating Booth. Speak over the Grand Master and you'll have to drop and give him 10.
At one late-January session, nine male students (one would-be knightess joined the sparring in a later class) lined up in two rows and faced Booth, who instructed them on the proper grasp of the sword: The first two fingers control the weapon, which balances like a lever in the palm of the hand. He called out strike positions. The students' swords danced in the air, leaping and twisting and landing in the gut of an invisible opponent. Afterward, they paired up and practiced blocking and thrusting.
“Your body is moving too much,” Booth said to a wiggly student.
To teach precision and control, Booth enlisted two punching bags. The pupils had 30 seconds to show the equipment who was boss. He corrected one student's posture, reminding him to place his hand on his back hip in a classic Zorro pose.
On a typical day, you're not likely to meet an angry knight in a dark alley, but you could very well find yourself face-to-face with a mugger wielding a small, sharp weapon. For the next set of drills, the students grabbed wooden daggers as Booth issued a warning: This drill was not about stabbing or throwing knives.
“Stabbing is to be discouraged. It's really hard to pull a knife out of someone,” he said.
A better option: Disarm the villain.
Booth demonstrated a multistep choreography that involved grabbing and twisting the opponent's wrist, pulling the arm back, placing weight on the shoulder and snapping a body part. If all goes as planned, the perpetrator will release the weapon and need a cast.
“They were doing this in the 15th century,” he said. “It's an old trick.”

After class, Joseph Legacy, who received a 10-pack of lessons as a gift from his fiancee, was able to try on a suit of armor. Dream-come-true is a bit of a stretch, but the self-proclaimed “major nerd” was clearly excited. A radar tech with the D.C. police, Legacy grew up on King Arthur and fantasy books, Pathfinder and Dungeons & Dragons. Now he's all grown up and gallivanting around in 30 pounds of chain mail.
“Would I like to get into sparring? Yes,” he said. “Do I think I'll be able to translate German longsword to the street? Probably not.”
These days, the closest the European martial art gets to the street is a second-floor room overlooking King Street.
On a Thursday night, while diners ate and drank below, Sir Andrew and Sir Albert fought two practice bouts in a sliver of space by a brick fireplace. Both modern-day knights suffered wounds — a bruised elbow for Thompson, swollen knuckles for Venezia. But the knight's code of courage and valor doesn't include grousing and griping.
“I woke up this morning and wished I could spar again today,” Venezia said the next day. “It's addicting.”

Trump's golf club must pay $5.7M to locked-out members, judge rules
Members of a Florida golf club who claimed they were barred from using the facility after Donald Trump purchased it in 2012 are entitled to return of their money, a federal judge has ruled.
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled Wednesday that the Trump National Golf Club has to pay $5.7 million in membership deposits and interest to the locked-out members, Politico, Bloomberg and CNN Money report.
The class action suit was filed on behalf of 65 club members who paid deposits ranging from $35,000 to $210,000.
When the club was owned by Ritz-Carlton, membership agreements allowed the members to be placed on a resignation waiting list, and they would get their money back when new members joined, according to Marra's opinion (PDF). They would be entitled to continue to use the club until their resignation, although they had to continue paying dues and remain in good standing, Marra concluded, based on his reading of the contract documents.
After Trump purchased the club, those on the resignation list were initially informed that they would have no club access, but they wouldn't have to pay annual dues. The club changed the policy at the beginning of 2013, however, and charged annual dues even while barring the resignation-list members from the club.
Marra found the golf club had recalled the memberships of those on the resignation list by barring them from the facilities. That entitled them to a refund of their deposits within 30 days, he said.
A lawyer for the Trump Organization told Politico an appeal is planned. “The members who resigned were all members under Ritz-Carlton who resigned prior to Trump taking ownership. Trump purchased the club from Ritz and effectively saved it because it was in financial ruin. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we disagree with the judge's ruling and intend to appeal it,” said the lawyer, Alan Garten.
The Republic of Ireland is one of the most tolerant countries in the world when it comes to the practice of religion, according to new research.
Not only that but social hostility towards religion is on the decline, bucking an international trend that has coincided with concerns about migrants, according to Whether it be Government restrictions or social hostility ... Ireland is rated at the “low” end of the scale by a report by the Washington-based think-tank the Pew Research Center.
The study, which measures intolerance under two headings – government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion, found that both had increased in 2015 for the first time in three years.
However, the Republic of Ireland rated at the “low” end of the scale in both categories in the 198 country index, showing a drop under the social hostilities measure.
In contrast, the UK rated “high” on social hostility involving religion – just below the worst ranking of “very high”. So too did Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the US and Australia.
Spain, Sweden, Norway and Canada are rated “moderate”.
In Europe Ireland was joined by France, Portugal, Finland, and the Baltic States in being rated “low” in levels of social hostility involving religion.
Looking at Government restrictions on religion, the Pew Center found that Ireland was again at the “low” end of the scale, with Britain this time, also Portugal, Sweden, Finland in Europe, Canada and Australia.
It found “high” Government restrictions on religion in France, while similar retrictions in other European countries were “moderate”, as they were in the US .
Harassment
Across Europe, “more than half of the 45 countries in the region (53 per cent) experienced an increase in government harassment or use of force from 2014 to 2015, the report found.
“Twenty-seven European countries (60 per cent) saw widespread government harassment or intimidation of religious groups in 2015, up from 17 countries in 2014 .”
Governments of 24 countries in Europe (53 per cent) “used some type of force against religious groups, an increase from 15 (33 per cent) in 2014,” it said.
Two European countries, France and Russia, “each had more than 200 cases of government force against religious groups, mostly of individuals being punished for violating the ban on face coverings in public spaces and government buildings in France, and groups being prosecuted in Russia for publicly exercising their religion.”
France and Russia were also the only two European countries with more than 200 cases of government force against religious groups in 2014, but there was a significant rise in 2015 in the number of countries in Europe where lower numbers of incidents occurred.
Much of this was related “to Europe's incoming refugee population. In 2015, 1.3 million migrants applied for asylum in Europe” and “more than half (54 per cent) came from three Muslim-majority countries, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq”.
Unsurprisingly the Pew study found government restrictions on religion to be “very high” in Russia, China, North Africa, the Middle East, and Indonesia. It also found social hostility involving religion to be “very high” in Russia, as well as in India and Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and Nigeria.
Overall it found that 40 per cent of countries worldwide had high or very high levels of restrictions on religion, up from 34 per cent in 2014.
A waterfront-altering redevelopment of the Domino Sugar refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is poised to be approved by the city this week after the de Blasio administration struck a deal Monday to include more affordable housing units in the project.
The compromise signaled the end of a temporary impasse on the high-profile plan, which was abruptly held up last month by aides to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a left-leaning Democrat keen to demonstrate that he takes a different attitude toward real estate from his development-oriented predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg.
The $1.5 billion project, which includes several slim and architecturally distinctive residential towers, office space for tech firms and an expansion of riverfront parkland, had been years in the making. But City Hall officials felt the number of affordable apartments set aside in the project — 660 units out of 2,300 total — was too little.
The negotiations had been viewed as a test case both for Mr. de Blasio, who turned his pledge to expand affordable housing into a populist rallying cry, and the city's real estate establishment, which is wary about just how aggressively the mayor plans to negotiate with developers in order to keep that promise.
I noticed the streeter asking about Premier Kathleen Wynne's steadily fizzling popularity in a local newspaper dropped on my driveway two days ago.
Eight Midtown residents were asked whether the most unpopular premier in Canada could still pull a rabbit out of a hat and win a second term in 2018.
I shouldn't be surprised (seeing as Midtown is Liberal territory) that all but one actually thought she was doing what was right with her “fair” hydro scheme that will (temporarily) slash hydro rates by 25%.
One seemingly naive woman suggested that all would be right with the world once the rates are cut and get this, that the embattled Wynne actually had her best interests in mind.
OK, then.
There was no recognition from any of them of the fact that the Liberals messed up hydro rates in the first place, or that selling off slightly more than 50% of hydro shares will give the government less control over energy prices, or that Wynne has opted to mortgage her own grandchildren's future with the temporary four-year rate fix (by amortizing the debt used to pay for electricity system upgrades over a longer period.)
But least of all, these naive souls seemed to have bought the Liberal spin and trust that Wynne was doing this to truly help them — not as a cynical attempt to improve her popularity before she returns to the polls next June.
It was truly frustrating to read, but I suspect there are many other Wynne deniers out there — voters who still don't believe (after so many $1-billion-plus fiascos) that this premier and her sad, tired, incompetent, duplicitous and arrogant cabinet only care about their own interests and those special interests (can we say teachers' unions and overpaid bureaucratic fatcats) who will endeavour to keep them in office.
So, I'm not the least bit surprised that while Wynne and Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault were presenting a public face of deep concern for Ontario residents and their hydro bills (and shamelessly lauding themselves for this alleged concern), privately they were only moving the shells around — temporarily.
According to a confidential cabinet document released by the Tories on Thursday, once the dust settles on another Liberal term (at least in their fantasies), hydro rates will spike again and by 2024 they will reach on average $161 per month and $183 per month by 2026 compared to $123 per month this year.
The cabinet document also reveals that the controversial debt retirement charge will return under another name.
It has to happen. The government has no money. They can't prop up their vote-buying schemes forever.
Interestingly enough, in his statement Thursday, Thibeault does not deny the rate increases but instead tries to change the channel by insisting the cabinet document is “outdated,” a distraction from their charitable efforts (the latter my words) and that PC Leader Patrick Brown has no “real plan.”
Look, what or who would anyone believe: A leaked cabinet document or a government that has messed up nearly every file it has dealt with (I haven't even mentioned health care), has left the province mercilessly drowning in debt, put together a fake balanced budget and still has the gall to come out with cheesy spin about the great job they're doing for Ontario residents.
I know it. Likely most of those who will read this article will agree, as well.
If only those people who still think Wynne is going to save them with a few shiny baubles could be shocked into reality.

Some UCLA graduate student academic workers have lost access to their full health benefits, after their departments failed to process payment for their tuition and fees on time.
The Office of the Registrar informed the teaching assistants, tutors and readers that they had outstanding balances on BruinBill on Thursday.
United Auto Workers Local 2865, the union representing academic student employees, filed eight complaints with UCLA Employee and Labor Relations, alleging the university violated the contract for academic workers by failing to provide health insurance for student employees who work 25 percent time or more.
[Related: UC, UAW Local 2865 reach agreement, avert finals week strike]
Jonathan Koch, recording secretary for UAW and a graduate student in music said at least 30 graduate students in seven different departments told him they had difficulties accessing health care. For instance, some had trouble making appointments online with the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center or picking up prescriptions. Affected departments include economics, comparative literature and political science.
Koch said after meeting with Ashe Center officials, he learned that graduate students with fees-pending status could access Ashe services as a temporary solution.
Zeke Trautenberg, a head steward for UAW and a Spanish and Portuguese graduate student, said that while fees were due on Sept. 20, he received notification that he had not paid his tuition on Sept. 22. Trautenberg added he immediately requested meetings with officials from UCLA Labor Relations, but they declined to see him.
In a statement released by UCLA media relations Tuesday, officials said they asked affected departments to issue fee waivers for academic graduate student employees and graduate student researchers in fees-pending status by 5 p.m. Tuesday.
“The Graduate Division is determining who was impacted, and what the outstanding issues and root causes were,” the statement said. “The issue will be discussed at an upcoming meeting for department chairs, where recommendations will be made to prevent this problem from recurring, and how to keep students better informed of their status and access to resources.”
The statement also said that approximately 1,100 students currently have fees-pending status, but only about 62 students had fee remission issues. The statement also said 35 academic student employees currently have payment pending, but all 62 are expected to receive fee deferrals by the end of the day.
“Fee remissions can be delayed for many reasons, such as when a student does not complete paperwork on time, when a department must wait to finalize teaching assistant appointments, or the hiring department has a high volume of requests to process,” the UCLA statement said.
Mike Miller, a UAW representative and a mathematics graduate student, said he does not think that most of the fee remission issues were due to unsubmitted paperwork. He added he thinks UCLA should come up with a permanent solution to what he has heard is a recurring problem.
Ashe Center sent an email to graduate students with fees-pending status to assure them they would still have access to the full range of services at Ashe Center without incurring out-of-pocket costs. The email also said students with fees-pending status who seek outside medical care or pick up a prescription from any pharmacy other than Ashe, will incur the full fee for those services or medications until their status is updated.
[Related: Petition calls for negotiations with UAW Local 2865]
Trautenberg said he thinks Ashe's solution does not address health insurance issues for students who live farther away from school who need access to doctors and pharmacies close to home. He added he thinks UCLA should reimburse students who incur out-of-pocket costs.
Trautenberg added some students have still had trouble making doctor appointments at Ashe, and one said he had used part of his stipend to cover tuition without his consent.
UAW will hold a rally Wednesday morning at Murphy Hall to protest what they call a lack of access to health coverage.
LONDON (Reuters) - A "brain training" iPad game developed in Britain may improve the memory of patients with schizophrenia, helping them in their daily lives at home and at work, researchers said on Monday.
Scientists at Cambridge University said tests on a small number of patients who played the game over four weeks found they had improvements in memory and learning.
The game, "Wizard", is designed to help so-called episodic memory -- the type of memory needed to remember where you left your keys several hours ago, or to remember a few hours later where you parked your car in a multi-storey car park.
Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, ranging from changes in behaviour through to hallucinations and delusions.
While some psychotic symptoms can be reasonably well treated with medication, patients often still have debilitating problems with memory and cognitive function, meaning they struggle to get back to work or stay in education.
There is increasing evidence that computer-assisted training can help people with schizophrenia overcome some of their symptoms, with better outcomes in their daily lives.
This study, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that 22 patients who played the memory game made significantly fewer errors and needed significantly fewer attempts to remember the location of different patterns specific tests.
They also improved their scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, which doctors use to rate the social, occupational and psychological functioning of adults.
Importantly, the patients also said they enjoyed the game and were motivated to play it across the eight hours of cognitive training. The researchers said this was important, since lack of motivation is a common feature of schizophrenia.
"We need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with episodic memory, but slow progress is being made towards developing a drug treatment," said Barbara Sahakian from the department of psychiatry at Cambridge University.
"This proof-of-concept study...demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed. (And) because the game is interesting, even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training."

(RNS) President Obama addressed the National Prayer Breakfast this morning in Washington.
The big news was that Joshua DuBois, the director of the White House faith-based office, is leaving the administration this Friday. We'll have more in that in our report later today.
Meanwhile, here's a transcript, courtesy of the White House, of Obama's remarks this morning.
For Immediate Release February 7, 2013
REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
AT THE NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST
Washington Hilton
Washington, D.C.
9:03 A.M. EST
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Please have a seat.
Mark, thank you for that introduction. I thought he was going to talk about my gray hair. (Laughter.) It is true that my daughters are gorgeous. (Laughter.) That's because my wife is gorgeous. (Applause.) And my goal is to improve my gene pool.
To Mark and Jeff, thank you for your wonderful work on behalf of this breakfast. To all of those who worked so hard to put this together; to the heads of state, members of Congress, and my Cabinet, religious leaders and distinguished guests. To our outstanding speaker. To all the faithful who've journeyed to our capital, Michelle and I are truly honored to be with you this morning.
Before I begin, I hope people don't mind me taking a moment of personal privilege. I want to say a quick word about a close friend of mine and yours, Joshua Dubois. Now, some of you may not know Joshua, but Joshua has been at my side — in work and in prayer — for years now. He is a young reverend, but wise in years. He's worked on my staff. He's done an outstanding job as the head of our Faith-Based office.
Every morning he sends me via email a daily meditation — a snippet of Scripture for me to reflect on. And it has meant the world to me. And despite my pleas, tomorrow will be his last day in the White House. So this morning I want to publically thank Joshua for all that he's done, and I know that everybody joins me in wishing him all the best in his future endeavors — including getting married. (Applause.)
It says something about us — as a nation and as a people — that every year, for 61 years now, this great prayerful tradition has endured. It says something about us that every year, in times of triumph and in tragedy, in calm and in crisis, we come together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as brothers and sisters, and as children of God. Every year, in the midst of all our busy and noisy lives, we set aside one morning to gather as one community, united in prayer.
We do so because we're a nation ever humbled by our history, and we're ever attentive to our imperfections — particularly the imperfections of our President. We come together because we're a people of faith. We know that faith is something that must be cultivated. Faith is not a possession. Faith is a process.
I was struck by the passage that was read earlier from the Book of Hebrews: “Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists and He rewards those who diligently seek Him.” He rewards those who diligently seek Him — not just for one moment, or one day, but for every moment, and every day.
As Christians, we place our faith in the nail-scarred hands of Jesus Christ. But so many other Americans also know the close embrace of faith — Muslims and Jews, Hindus and Sikhs. And all Americans — whether religious or secular — have a deep and abiding faith in this nation.
Recently I had occasion to reflect on the power of faith. A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, I was blessed to place my hand on the Bibles of two great Americans, two men whose faith still echoes today. One was the Bible owned by President Abraham Lincoln, and the other, the Bible owned by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As I prepared to take the sacred oath, I thought about these two men, and I thought of how, in times of joy and pain and uncertainty, they turned to their Bibles to seek the wisdom of God's word — and thought of how, for as long as we've been a nation, so many of our leaders, our Presidents, and our preachers, our legislators and our jurists have done the same. Each one faced their own challenges; each one finding in Scripture their own lessons from the Lord.
And as I was looking out on the crowd during the inauguration I thought of Dr. King. We often think of him standing tall in front of the endless crowds, stirring the nation's conscience with a bellowing voice and a mighty dream. But I also thought of his doubts and his fears, for those moments came as well — the lonely moments when he was left to confront the presence of long-festering injustice and undisguised hate; imagined the darkness and the doubt that must have surrounded him when he was in that Birmingham jail, and the anger that surely rose up in him the night his house was bombed with his wife and child inside, and the grief that shook him as he eulogized those four precious girls taken from this Earth as they gathered in a house of God.
And I was reminded that, yes, Dr. King was a man of audacious hope and a man of relentless optimism. But he was always — he was also a man occasionally brought to his knees in fear and in doubt and in helplessness. And in those moments, we know that he retreated alone to a quiet space so he could reflect and he could pray and he could grow his faith.
And I imagine he turned to certain verses that we now read. I imagine him reflecting on Isaiah, that we wait upon the Lord; that the Lord shall renew those who wait; that they shall mount up with wings as eagles, and they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.
We know that in Scripture, Dr. King found strength; in the Bible, he found conviction. In the words of God, he found a truth about the dignity of man that, once realized, he never relinquished.
We know Lincoln had such moments as well. To see this country torn apart, to see his fellow citizens waging a ferocious war that pitted brother against brother, family against family — that was as heavy a burden as any President will ever have to bear.
We know Lincoln constantly met with troops and visited the wounded and honored the dead. And the toll mounted day after day, week after week. And you can see in the lines of his face the toll that the war cost him. But he did not break. Even as he buried a beloved son, he did not break. Even as he struggled to overcome melancholy, despair, grief, he did not break.
And we know that he surely found solace in Scripture; that he could acknowledge his own doubts, that he was humbled in the face of the Lord. And that, I think, allowed him to become a better leader. It's what allowed him in what may be one of the greatest speeches ever written, in his second Inaugural, to describe the Union and the Confederate soldier alike — both reading the same Bible, both prayed to the same God, but “the prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.”
In Lincoln's eyes, the power of faith was humbling, allowing us to embrace our limits in knowing God's will. And as a consequence, he was able to see God in those who vehemently opposed him.
Today, the divisions in this country are, thankfully, not as deep or destructive as when Lincoln led, but they are real. The differences in how we hope to move our nation forward are less pronounced than when King marched, but they do exist. And as we debate what is right and what is just, what is the surest way to create a more hopeful — for our children — how we're going to reduce our deficit, what kind of tax plans we're going to have, how we're going to make sure that every child is getting a great education — and, Doctor, it is very encouraging to me that you turned out so well by your mom not letting you watch TV. I'm going to tell my daughters that when they complain. (Laughter.) In the midst of all these debates, we must keep that same humility that Dr. King and Lincoln and Washington and all our great leaders understood is at the core of true leadership.
In a democracy as big and as diverse as ours, we will encounter every opinion. And our task as citizens — whether we are leaders in government or business or spreading the word — is to spend our days with open hearts and open minds; to seek out the truth that exists in an opposing view and to find the common ground that allows for us as a nation, as a people, to take real and meaningful action. And we have to do that humbly, for no one can know the full and encompassing mind of God. And we have to do it every day, not just at a prayer breakfast.
I have to say this is now our fifth prayer breakfast and it is always just a wonderful event. But I do worry sometimes that as soon as we leave the prayer breakfast, everything we've been talking about the whole time at the prayer breakfast seems to be forgotten — on the same day of the prayer breakfast. (Laughter.) I mean, you'd like to think that the shelf life wasn't so short. (Laughter.) But I go back to the Oval Office and I start watching the cable news networks and it's like we didn't pray. (Laughter.)
And so my hope is that humility, that that carries over every day, every moment. While God may reveal His plan to us in portions, the expanse of His plan is for God, and God alone, to understand. “For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know even as also I am known.” Until that moment, until we know, and are fully known, all we can do is live our lives in a Godly way and assume that those we deal with every day, including those in an opposing party, they're groping their way, doing their best, going through the same struggles we're going through.
And in that pursuit, we are blessed with guidance. God has told us how He wishes for us to spend our days. His Commandments are there to be followed. Jesus is there to guide us; the Holy Spirit, to help us. Love the Lord God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. Love your neighbor as yourself. See in everyone, even in those with whom you disagree most vehemently, the face of God. For we are all His children.
That's what I thought of as I took the oath of office a few weeks ago and touched those Bibles — the comfort that Scripture gave Lincoln and King and so many leaders throughout our history; the verses they cherished, and how those words of God are there for us as well, waiting to be read any day that we choose. I thought about how their faith gave them the strength to meet the challenges of their time, just as our faith can give us the strength to meet the challenges of ours. And most of all, I thought about their humility, and how we don't seem to live that out the way we should, every day, even when we give lip service to it.
As President, sometimes I have to search for the words to console the inconsolable. Sometimes I search Scripture to determine how best to balance life as a President and as a husband and as a father. I often search for Scripture to figure out how I can be a better man as well as a better President. And I believe that we are united in these struggles. But I also believe that we are united in the knowledge of a redeeming Savior, whose grace is sufficient for the multitude of our sins, and whose love is never failing.
And most of all, I know that all Americans — men and women of different faiths and, yes, those of no faith that they can name — are, nevertheless, joined together in common purpose, believing in something that is bigger than ourselves, and the ideals that lie at the heart of our nation's founding — that as a people we are bound together.
And so this morning, let us summon the common resolve that comes from our faith. Let us pray to God that we may be worthy of the many blessings He has bestowed upon our nation. Let us retain that humility not just during this hour but for every hour. And let me suggest that those of us with the most power and influence need to be the humblest. And let us promise Him and to each other, every day as the sun rises over America that it will rise over a people who are striving to make this a more perfect union.
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

Update: Jay Electronica put out a new song last night (14/03/14). The name of the song matches with the Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn) tracklist that Jay Electronica shared on Twitter in July 2012.
It's 2007, and Jay Electronica has just put out Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge). The 15 continuous minutes of music, without drums, built from Jon Brion's soundtrack to the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a timeless classic. Idiosyncratically beautiful, the tape interspersed used samples from Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, spoken word, and an abstract rhyming style over orchestrated keys of ivory white and charcoal black.
It was aural haute couture. If you believed it, Jay Electronica, call him Jay ElecHannukah, Jay ElecRammadan, Muhammad A'salaamaleikum, was the deity that hip-hop had been waiting for. Even if you were atheist to the idea of a biblical rap icon, Jay Electronica perpetuated any worthwhile rap blog, heralded under the words: The Best Thing To Happen To Hip-Hop. In other words, he was fucking brilliant.
It's 2013, and five years later, Jay Electronica hasn't released another full-length. He's had several singles, “Exhibit A” and “Exhibit C”, and signed to Roc Nation. He's received props from Jay-Z, who stated – “Him as a lyricist is almost scary. He's scary good” – and hat-tips from Q-Tip, Nas, Diddy, and Erkyah Badu, with whom he has a child. But, still no album.
Understandably, for anyone with more than a casual interest in hip-hop, Act II: Patents of Nobility (The Turn) is the Holy Grail. Jay has tweeted on two occasions that the album is complete, once in 2011, and again, with a tracklist, in July 2012. But, with no fixed release date, and a half-decade wait, anticipation for the record has reached both a fever point, and dismissal. Rap fans who believe that artists owe them something, rather than the other way round, have been demanding Jay release his record. But they're slightly missing the point. It is meant to be a Holy Grail.
Let's take into account the two titles for both records – (The Pledge) and (The Turn) – and contextualise them next to this quote from the film, The Prestige. Let Michael Caine explain.
“Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called "The Pledge". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige"."
Jay Electronica loves films – remember, his first mixtape was built entirely upon the Eternal Sunshine soundtrack and movie samples – therefore it wouldn't be ridiculous to suggest that he has built his career upon The Prestige. It's fact that the first two album titles directly correlate to the above quote, with a third, reportedly titled Act III: The Last Will & Testament of Timothy Elpadaro Thedford (The Prestige), cementing the theory.
If we take the The Prestige theory into account, then Jay Electronica has already released his Pledge. Act I seemed ordinary, built upon a cult film soundtrack, but it wasn't. It was special. Now, with the disappearance of its follow up, he has made “the ordinary something… do something extraordinary”, by generating a truckload of hype for something that doesn't exist. Because it's all part of an elaborate magic trick, if we follow the theory, the only way that the record can come out is with the conclusion, The Prestige. Once Act III is released as the culmination of the trick, it is only then, that Act II will make sense, or be discovered.
If we delve further into the album titles, then the theory can be further built upon. Timothy Elpadaro Thedford is Jay Electronica's real name, and the title of the third act. This act, The Prestige, which is the conclusion of the magic trick, needs to be released in order to make the second act, The Turn, make sense. In simple terms, a magician can hold a coin, make it disappear, and reappear behind your ear. The first part, the coin, is The Pledge, and the reappearance is The Prestige. Once those two are in place, then if he chooses, the magician can explain the second act, the disappearance of the coin, The Turn. The album titles follow this theory. Once Act III: The Last Will & Testament of Timothy Elpadaro Thedford is released, it will give purpose to Act II: Patents of Nobility. A Patent of Nobility is the appointment of an aristocrat, and in this case, would refer to the re-birthing of Jay Electronica as a member of hip-hop's high society. If we take into account the coin theory, then without the third part of the trick, the second act, The Turn, will not be tangible, because it cannot exist without its former and latter parts.
It's easy to argue that this idea is reaching harder than a tiptoe teetering five-year old for the cookie jar. Jay has had a few featured tracks out in the past few years, all of which seem to be touched with glaucoma, a sort of unfocused haze. Maybe the reason Act II isn't out yet is because it's just not good enough. But they're featured artist tracks, and they're very separate. If anything, they're keeping Jay Electronica's name in the spotlight, assuring us that a follow up is imminent.
The religious references to deities and Holy Grails aren't just scattered in here because Jay Electronica is the musical equivalent of a Christ-like-figure. Alongside being married to a Rothschild, he's also a member of the Five Percent Nation, the religious group formed by Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X. It's a movement that's been affiliated with hip-hop from the very beginning, coining lexicon from “ciphers”, to “dropping science” and influencing everyone from Big Daddy Kane, Rakim, Wu-Tang Clan, Brand Nubian and Nas.
With these artists, and any others associated with the Five Percenters, music was more than just a message. It was a metamorphosis of the base elements of the Nation of Gods and Earth into the wisdom of song writing. It's the reason why no one else, except Jay Electronica, has managed to capture the essence of The Golden Era since. If Jay Electronica subscribes to the hip hop ideals of The Five Percenters, then he's going to put out his record when he's ready, and realise his next vision as much more than a piece of throwaway music uploaded to the internet.
Jay Electronica was first featured as an unsigned artist in The Source almost ten years ago, and it's clear that he isn't constrained by time. In an interview with URB in 2008, he stated: “Most people wake up everyday and are worried about doing stuff based on time. I used to feel like I gotta do this, this and that before this time, but I don't feel that way anymore.” Regardless of the hungry hip-hop heads who are convinced they're dying of thirst (despite this year being an all-you-can-eat buffet of great releases), Jay doesn't need to release his record any time soon. Not if anything else he releases is as timeless as Act I: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge).
But in the five years that we've waited, the features this year – on “Control” and “Suplexes Inside of Complexes & Duplexes” – and scattered festival appearances suggest he's slowly building up to something. If The Prestige theory is to be believed, then maybe we're waiting for Act III, and Act II is already out there, somewhere. Hidden.

Women's Mid-Calf Boots
A trend that has been noticed by all fashionistas on the runway is the mid-calf length boots which come in handy for any lady. Mid calf boots are great for those who want more than the ankle height yet still have the desire to flaunt their sexy legs. Look taller and leaner in mid height stiletto boots. Adding a stiletto heel to boots, gives the classic boot design a feminine and elegant feel. Mid-calf boots are taller than booties, however they are not as tall as knee-high boots.
Their shaft length finish just under the calf or halfway up the calf. They are trending and looking particularly fresh this season. And based on what the fashion world reveals, there is no stopping the mid-calf boot trend. The most popular shoe on our site as a matter of fact is a Patent Pointy Toe Lucite Heel Boot; it comes in bold colors that take an outfit for ordinary to extraordinary. Another favorite includes the Combat Lace Block Heel Boots which are perfect for any occasion. The mid calf boots come to the rescue whenever you are not sure what to wear, and there are so many reasons why we welcome them into the cooler seasons.
When it comes to styling, mid calf boots can be combined with many different outfits. Shirt dresses is one of the most traditional ways to wear mid-calf boots. These boots should be worn with a dress above your knees which will elongate your legs. One of the most popular ways is to wear them with plain skinny jeans, and if you are young and bold then mid-calf boots go great with shorts because they create a bold statement. Other great fashion ideas also include combining them with over-the-knee socks which make a great accessory, or with mini skirts, maxi skirts, and even leggings.
Meshach Taylor, who played a lovable ex-convict surrounded by boisterous Southern belles on the sitcom Designing Women and appeared in numerous other TV and film roles, died of cancer at age 67, his agent said Sunday.
Taylor died Saturday at his home near Los Angeles, according to agent Dede Binder.
Taylor got an Emmy nod for his portrayal of Anthony Bouvier on Designing Women from 1986 to 1993. Then he costarred for four seasons on another successful comedy, Dave's World, as the best friend of a newspaper humor columnist played by the series' star, Harry Anderson.
Other series included the cult favorite Buffalo Bill and the popular Nickelodeon comedy Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide.
Taylor's movie roles included a flamboyant window dresser in the 1987 comedy-romance Mannequin as well as Damien: Omen II.
He guested on many series including Hannah Montana, The Unit, Hill Street Blues, Barney Miller, Lou Grant, The DrewCarey Show, and, in an episode that aired in January, Criminal Minds, which stars Joe Montegna, with whom Taylor performed early in his career as a fellow member of Chicago's Organic Theater Company. Taylor also had been a member of that city's Goodman Theatre.
The Boston-born Taylor started acting in community shows in New Orleans, where his father was dean of students at Dillard University. He continued doing roles in Indianapolis after his father moved to Indiana University as dean of the college of arts and sciences.

After college, Taylor got a job at an Indianapolis radio station, where he rose from a "flunky job" to Statehouse reporter, he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 1989.
"It was interesting for a while," he said. "But once you get involved in Indiana politics you see what a yawn it is."
Resuming his acting pursuit, he set up a black arts theatre to keep kids off the street, then joined the national touring company of Hair. His acting career was launched.
After Hair, he became a part of the burgeoning theater world in Chicago, where he stayed until 1979 before heading for Los Angeles.
Smaller role turns big
Seemingly his gig on "Designing Women" could have been even more short-lived. It was initially a one-shot.
"It was for the Thanksgiving show, about halfway through the first season," Taylor said. But producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason told him if the character clicked with audiences he could stay.
It did. He spun comic gold with co-stars Jean Smart, Dixie Carter, Annie Potts and Delta Burke, and never left.
Meanwhile, his real life worked its way into one episode.
"We were doing some promotional work in Lubbock, Texas, and somehow Delta Burke and I got booked into the same hotel suite," he said. They alerted their respective significant others to the mix-up, then muddled through with the shared accommodations.
"When we got back I told Linda, and she put it into a show: We got stranded at a motel during a blizzard and ended up in the same bed!"
Taylor is survived by his four children and his wife, Bianca Ferguson.
For the first time in more than 50 years of surveys, the CDC on Wednesday reported that more than 90% of Americans — 90.8% of us, to be specific — have health insurance.
Until now, no major survey had ever found that the uninsured rate in America has hit single digits.
The data comes from the National Health Interview Survey, which the CDC and the Census Bureau have been conducting for more than 50 years. The questions have sometimes changed, but until this year, the answers haven't: More than 10% of respondents, and sometimes as many as 18% of Americans, have reported that they've been uninsured.
The clear factor is the Affordable Care Act's push for coverage expansion, which kicked in almost two years ago. I spoke about the ACA's role with several experts back in June, and you can easily see the law's effects on the chart.
Nearly 16 million fewer Americans were uninsured in early 2015 compared to 2013.
And based on past precedent, there's every expectation that the uninsured rate will continue to go down as enrollment in the ACA exchanges and Medicaid keeps going up.
For example, the CDC issues data on the uninsured rate throughout the year, and Wednesday's results are based on surveys conducted between January and March of 2015. (Since it's not full-year data, CDC calls it their early release program.) And last year's equivalent early-release report, which surveyed Americans between January and March 2014, found that 13.1% of Americans were uninsured at the time. But after a full year's worth of 2014 data, the number of uninsured was down to 11.5%.
CDC's new report also plays up the divide between Medicaid expansion states and non-Medicaid expansion states.
In states that haven't expanded in Medicaid, about 23% of residents under age-65 were uninsured in 2013; that's down to about 17%. But in states that have expanded Medicaid? The comparable uninsured rate has fallen from about 18.5% in 2013 to 10.5% this year.
Who's going to pay for coverage expansion? Listen to Dan and colleagues debate whether health care spending is about to skyrocket.
I've already seen a few articles on this new data, but there are several important caveats that have been mostly overlooked.
One is that CDC's report of sub-10% uninsured counts Medicare enrollees; among Americans ages 18-64, the uninsured rate is 13.0%.
And something else I haven't seen reported is that the uninsured rate for America's poor is still awfully high. About 28% of poor Americans and 24% of near-poor Americans didn't have coverage, versus 7.5% of Americans who weren't poor.
It's also worth noting that the uptick in insurance coverage has been disproportionately driven by more people getting private health plans, as the chart below shows.

Of course, buying a health plan doesn't cure all your woes. Plenty of plans sold through ACA exchanges are thin and force customers to pay many out-of-pocket costs. Democrats like Bernie Sanders are trying to make "underinsurance" into a key political issue.
And there are still questions over who will pay for America's growing health care bill.
But it's also clear if you lack health coverage, becoming insured offers real benefits. More insurance improves your access to see a doctor, and reduces your problems paying for medical care.
Being insured even appears to cut down on your risk of death.
Having more insured customers is good for the health care industry, too. Hospitals are reporting huge jobs gains, and the health care sector is reporting its best 12-month stretch of new jobs in almost 25 years.

The germ for this post came from a question I was asked by a reader of this blog:
In SQLRPG do I have to define cursor, open cursor, fetch, close cursor if I only want one record?
That is a lot of work just to retrieve one record. Fortunately there is a very simple method where I can retrieve a field, multiple fields, the entire record, or join to another record, etc providing I am just returning one record/row.
But before I get started let me give the DDS of my example file, TESTFILE , and show the data it contains.
01 A R TESTFILER 02 A FCHAR 3A 03 A FPACKED 3P 0 04 A FDATE L 05 A FTIME T 06 A FTIMESTAMP Z 07 A FDFT 1A DFT('A') 08 A FNULL 1A ALWNULL 09 A DFT(*NULL) 10 A K FCHAR
And the file contains two records:
FCHAR FPACKED FDATE FTIME FTIMESTAMP FDFT FNULL 1 1 2001-07-05 08.38.00 2016-05-04-15.40.01.000000 A - 2 2 2001-04-15 19.12.23 2015-04-30-15.45.12.000000 A X ******** End of report ********
I am sure I do not have to explain what the different types of fields are. Just not that the field FNULL contains null in the first record.
In my first example I want to retrieve the data from the first record/row. I use the SELECT INTO which allows me to retrieve just one row/record from the statement.
dcl-s xTime time ; exec sql SELECT FTIME INTO :xTime FROM TESTFILE WHERE FCHAR = '1' ;
The only difference between this Select and the many others I have used in this blog is the INTO clause. This takes the value from the retrieved record's FTIME field and places it in my program variable xTime . As the SELECT INTO can only retrieve one record/row I have to make sure that my WHERE is unique. If it is not the statement will not complete successfully and the value of the SQL Code field, SQLCOD , will be -811.
This next example show how to retrieve a value from a field that could be null, I won't go into too many details as I have it extensively in the post SQL and null.
dcl-s xChar char(3) ; dcl-s NullInd int(5) ; exec sql SELECT FNULL INTO :xChar :NullInd FROM TESTFILE WHERE FCHAR = '1' ; dsply ('Rec 1: xChar = & NullInd = ') ; exec sql SELECT FNULL INTO :xChar :NullInd FROM TESTFILE WHERE FCHAR = '2' ; dsply ('Rec 2: xChar = & NullInd = ') ;
Notice that in the INTO clause there are two variables, notice that there is not a comma ( , ) between them. The first variable will contain the value from FNULL and the second will contain the value from the null byte map for the FNULL field. When I look at the output from the DSPLY operation code I see:
DSPLY Rec 1: xChar = < > & NullInd = DSPLY Rec 2: xChar = <X > & NullInd = <0>
The first record's FNULL is null, therefore, the program variable NullInd is -1.
Of course if I wanted to retrieve more than one field from the file I could just:
dcl-s xChar char(3) ; dcl-s xPacked packed(5) ; exec sql SELECT FCHAR,FPACKED INTO :xChar,:xPacked FROM TESTFILE WHERE FCHAR = '1' ;
If I wanted to retrieve all of the fields from the file I could list them all, or I could use a data structure like this:
dcl-ds InDs extname('TESTFILE') qualified ; end-ds ; dcl-s InNulls int(5) dim(7) ; exec sql SELECT * INTO :InDs :InNulls FROM TESTFILE WHERE FCHAR = '1' ; dsply ('Inds.fNull = + InNulls(7) = ') ;
Notice I have a data structure for nulls. As the FNULL can contain nulls I need this to contain the null byte map for FNULL . I can ignore the values for all the other array elements except for the seventh, which is the null byte value for FNULL .
DSPLY Inds.fNull = < > InNulls(7) =
I can even join multiple files together and retrieve a single "row":
dcl-s xChar char(3) ; dcl-s xName char(10) ; exec sql SELECT A.FCHAR,B.FNAME INTO :xChar,:xName FROM TESTFILE A LEFT OUTER JOIN NAMEFILE B ON A.FCHAR = B.FCHAR AND A.FCHAR = '1' ;
In all these examples I have used the SELECT INTO like a Chain operation code in RPG. But I can do so much more, like this:
dcl-s xChar1 char(3) ; dcl-s xChar2 like(xChar1) ; dcl-s xPacked packed(5) ; exec sql SELECT COUNT(*),MIN(FCHAR),MAX(FCHAR) INTO :xPacked,:xChar1,:xChar2 FROM TESTFILE ; dsply ('xPacked = + xChar1 = + xChar2 = ') ;
Which gives me the following:
DSPLY xPacked = <2> xChar1 = <1 > xChar2 = <2 >
xPacked contains the number of records/rows in the file
contains the number of records/rows in the file xChar1 is the lowest value in the field/column FCHAR
is the lowest value in the field/column xChar2 is the greatest value in the field/column FCHAR
You certainly cannot do that with a CHAIN .
You can learn more about the SELECT INTO statement from the IBM website here.

Image caption Dan Penteado admitted receiving housing and council tax benefit while at the BBC
A presenter on the BBC consumer affairs show Rogue Traders has been jailed for 12 weeks for benefit fraud totalling more than £24,000.
Dan Penteado, 40, from Bournemouth, admitted eight offences of dishonestly or knowingly claiming housing and council tax benefits.
Bournemouth Magistrates' Court heard he failed to declare his BBC earnings.
A spokesperson for the corporation said Penteado would not be returning to the programme.
He had been the motorbike-riding on-screen sidekick of Rogue Traders star Matt Allwright since 2001.
During a hearing at Bournemouth Magistrate's Court in June, the prosecution said the offences went back to 2007 when Penteado filled out his first claim form and failed to declare he had another bank account.
'Truly shocking'
The court heard he repeated the fraud in subsequent years up to 2011.
In that time Penteado failed to tell Bournemouth Borough Council he had been paid more than £56,000 for his work on Rogue Traders from 2008 to 2011.
He was paid a total of £24,077 in housing and council tax benefits.
His solicitor Terrence Scanlan told the court he committed the fraud from 2008 to 2012 because he was on a short-term contract with the BBC and made the "very poor judgment not to interrupt the flow of housing benefit".
The council brought the prosecution after a member of staff dealing with a benefit claim recognised the TV personality from a newspaper article.
Councillor David Smith, cabinet member for planning and environment, said: "The amount of money stolen in this case is truly shocking. We are pleased that Mr Penteado has now been successfully prosecuted and brought to justice.
"The council will not tolerate benefit fraud and will always take action to ensure public funds are protected from abuse and available to support the most vulnerable in society."
Passing sentence, chairman of the magistrate's board John Corben said it had not been a victimless crime and Penteado had "stolen from the public purse in a calculated way".
A BBC spokesperson said: "In light of the prosecution, Dan Penteado will not be returning to Rogue Traders."
The war in Yemen took an unexpected turn last week when the country's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was assassinated by a Houthi rebel militia at his home in the capital, Sanaa. Until early December, Saleh and the Houthis, an Iranian-backed group that controls Sanaa and much of northern Yemen, had been allies. But days before he was killed, Saleh split with the Houthis and reached out to Saudi Arabia in a bid to end its nearly three-year military campaign against the rebels, whom the Saudis view as an Iranian proxy force on their southern border. Bombing by a Saudi-led coalition has decimated infrastructure in already impoverished Yemen and killed thousands, while an intermittent Saudi blockade on all ports of entry in Houthi-controlled Yemen has created famine-like conditions and a severe fuel shortage.
Saleh had ruled Yemen for 33 years before he relinquished power in 2012 following a year of Arab Spring-inspired protests. He built a Yemeni state that grew increasingly centralized under his control and also made him extraordinarily wealthy. His regime stymied human rights and killed scores of protesters during the Arab Spring; after North and South Yemen were united in 1990, many southerners felt the Saleh regime was biased against them. Under Saleh's watch, and partly because of it, Yemen became home to a burgeoning Al Qaeda offshoot. Saleh played an astute political game that pitted his enemies against each other, while bringing others into his fold via a vast network of corruption. The inner workings of his government, especially the sprawling patronage network and kickbacks for everyone from businessmen to former Al Qaeda members, were secretive but crucial to how the country functioned during his presidency.
Saleh stayed in Sanaa after he stepped down, but grew increasingly frustrated with his successor, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Feeling sidelined, Saleh helped the Houthis in their conquest of Sanaa in September 2014. That Saleh connived his way back into a position of leadership by embracing his former enemies came as no surprise to Yemenis who knew their longtime leader would never give up power easily. Saleh's move to end the war by violating his alliance with the Houthis and making overtures to Saudi Arabia may salvage his reputation for many Yemenis. Others always viewed him as a necessary dictator, believing that Yemen's messy tribal politics required a strongman who could — at least to some extent — control powerful tribes.
When I lived in Yemen during the Arab Spring, Yemenis often told me that Saleh would never be killed by his opponents in a public and graphic manner like former Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi. It is against Yemen's all-important and unwritten tribal code to debase a leader in such a way. Urbanization has been eroding tribal law, however, and the war has taken a toll on common morality.
I asked five Yemenis of different ages and from many parts of society to reflect on Saleh's death and what they think it means for the future of their country. A recent internet and social media clampdown in Sanaa has made communication with people in Houthi-controlled territory much more difficult; as a result, I was unable to reach Houthi supporters for comment. All the Yemenis I spoke to were shocked that their famously mercurial ex-president was gone, but none saw his death as a good omen for Yemen, even those who risked their lives to protest against the Saleh regime in 2011. All but one answered in English; Maged al-Madhaji's comments have been translated from Arabic. Responses have been edited for clarity.

Personally, I didn't want Ali Abdullah Saleh to die now. I wanted him to end the Houthis first. No matter how bad he was, the Houthis are so much worse. They are full with anger. They lived most of their lives fighting. I have seen what they have done to Aden and the south. I wanted Ali Abdullah Saleh to take control so the peace process can have a chance. Three peace talks and nothing happened, and nothing will happen because Houthis are nothing but a rebel militia. However, Saleh deserved what happened to him. He is the reason behind all of the destruction that happened to Yemen. And I know that millions of Yemenis who have suffered from his actions are happy.

The death of Saleh is the end of an era, the end of three decades when everything that happened in Yemen was always about him. Saleh was the most manipulative and unethical politician. He was one of the shrewdest of Yemenis in a difficult and complicated country. Saleh was a dictator, and Yemenis' dreams were crushed during his reign. He left many questions unanswered. There is much sadness about his death because many were attached to the idea that he had the chance to save them from the rule of the Houthis and indeed from the brutal way in which the Houthis treated him. My personal feelings are mixed. This man has been in power for so many years. He was the most influential man in my country and responsible for everything that happened in Yemen. I suffered a lot because of that. Now we are suffering from a war for which Saleh was one of the causes. I am angry with him and saddened for him. The situation is very confusing as a result of his sudden and shocking departure.

The circumstances surrounding the killing of the former president remain unclear. What is certain is that his absence will add to the political ambiguity and leave a vacuum that I doubt can be filled soon. Saleh represented the highest degree of pragmatism and used all means in his power to protect his presidency. I will remain confused in explaining his decision to break his ties with Houthis: Was he betrayed? Was he suicidal? Did he miscalculate the reaction and the support he had from tribes and the people? What happened to him will remain a big question mark. Houthis are now alone to face the consequences of their action. They will be in total control of the north and are now the sole representatives in any future peace negotiations. I was saddened for the death of Saleh and shocked at the way he was shown by the Houthis' cameras! It [hasn't happened] in Yemeni history since imams used to display the heads of men they executed. The scenes were horrific and inhumane.

Since 2011, Saleh has played a very risky game that has endangered his life, his history, the whole country, and the future of the coming generations. Fueled by a desire for revenge against opposition parties who joined the youth revolution in 2011, he allied with the Houthis, no matter what the cost, and supported their expansion till they invaded Sanaa in September 2014. He played the same game successfully in 1994, when he used the Muslim Brotherhood to get rid of his vice president, Ali Salem, and the Socialist Party. Throughout all this, Saleh was putting the country and military forces in wars that only aimed to terminate his enemies. This has gradually dissolved and weakened the Yemeni army and the country's military institutions while the Houthis' militia was getting stronger. For the country, I think after Saleh's death, people will suffer a lot from the repercussions of his tricky politics, particularly in the capital Sanaa, where people will find it as difficult to confront the Houthis as we did in Taiz [where the Houthis have been engaged in a brutal and deadly ground war] and Aden.

In the three days prior to Saleh's death, I barely got any sleep. I was worried about my family and friends in Sanaa as the clashes were getting fierce. As one of the first organizers against Saleh during the revolution in 2011, my reaction to his death was a mix of different emotions, the worst of which were fear and uncertainty. During the protests, I would argue with protesters who held an image of Saleh's head hanged on a rope, and we would get into lengthy debates about capital punishment. For me, the ideal scenario for Saleh would have been a fair trial where Saleh would be sentenced for life for the crimes he committed during his rule and the crimes he committed during our revolution, where some of my friends were killed by his men. None of the scenarios in my head for Saleh during the war involved his death. For many Yemenis, he was just invincible, maybe even immortal. The Houthis have proved how strong they have become since they took over Sanaa, and Saleh's death paves the way for their dominance. The recent shift in power means that the prolonging of the war and the continuation of Saudi airstrikes are inevitable. For those like me who are abroad, this means the continuation of being worried about our loved ones and the continuation of sleepless nights.

AN SAS sniper killed an ISIS terrorist from almost 2.4km away using a mega-powerful rifle, a report says.
The Sun reports, it took three whole seconds for the bullet to reach the terror thug in Mosul, Iraq two weeks ago.
A veteran sniper hit the insurgent in the throat as he tried to escape a burnt-out building, killing him almost instantly, the Daily Star said.
It is believed to be one of the most difficult long-range kills in the elite regiment's history.
The paper claimed the shot was fired from a CheyTac M200 — a record-breaking US-made rifle with a max range of up to nearly 3.2km.
It was reportedly on loan to the British army as part of a battlefield trial.
The kill shot was made after a four-hour game of cat and mouse ended when the ISIS terrorist, himself a sniper, let his guard down as he moved between positions, a source told the paper.
“It was a classic counter-sniper operation”, they said.
“The SAS team had him in their sights on several occasions but did not have the time to get a shot off.
“At such a long range there are so many factors which can affect the flight of the bullet.
“The distance was so far that it took almost three seconds for the bullet to hit the target”.
The report comes after US President Donald Trump implored Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries to extinguish “Islamic extremism” emanating from the region, describing a “battle between good and evil” rather than a clash between the West and Islam.

In a pointed departure from his predecessor, Trump all but promised he would not publicly admonish Mideast rulers for human rights violations and oppressive reigns.
“We are not here to lecture — we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship,” Trump said, speaking in an ornate room in the Saudi capital.
“Instead, we are here to offer partnership — based on shared interests and values — to pursue a better future for us all.”
The president's address was the centrepiece of his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia, his first overseas trip since his January swearing-in.
For Trump, the trip is a reprieve from the crush of controversies that have marred his young presidency and an attempt to reset his relationship with a region and a religion he fiercely criticised as a candidate.

The NFL 1000 series aims to rank the best players in the league right now but doesn't take into account potential or projection of talent. That left a big hole, which is why the NFL 20 for '20 was created.
Who will be the NFL's best players in the year 2020?
After projecting the top players at each position, I looked at whom the 20 best players will be overall. Of course, this is a lot of speculation, but it's a fun way to recognize the best young guys in the NFL right now and look at the college players who could be impacting the game in five seasons.
Will a young quarterback like Russell Wilson or Andrew Luck take the No. 1 spot? Will J.J. Watt and Khalil Mack still be terrorizing offenses in five seasons?
Did we miss anyone? Let us know in the comments.
On Friday, the Daily Sports newspaper posted the first photograph from the Subaru Forester commercial created in collaboration with next year's live-action Attack on Titan film. The commercial will debut during this evening's Kinyōbi Road Show! (Friday Road Show!) movie airing.
Shinji Higuchi, the 48-year-old director of the live-action Attack on Titan film and The Floating Castle (Nobō no Shiro) , also worked on the commercial. The commercial features three Titan giants, including one regular Titan and one female Titan played by stunt people and enhanced with computer graphics. It took four hours to apply the female Titan's makeup.
In addition, the commercial filmed a model of a colossal Titan's upper body. The model was about two meters (about six feet) tall and required seven people to operate.
In the commercial, a Forester sports utility vehicle "skillfully dodges" the attacking Titans. The 30-second commercial costs several tens of millions of yen (several hundred thousand U.S. dollars). NTV's morning television program Zip! aired a segment (pictured above) on the commercial.
Principal photography on the live-action film itself has yet to begin, and the staff has not decided if the Titans in the film will appear as they do in the commercial. Still, Higuchi was grateful for this "welcome opportunity" to create a preview of what is to come.
Higuchi is scheduled to begin shooting Toho's film this summer. He worked as a storyboarder for the Evangelion television series and the three reboot films, and he served as assistant director on Royal Space Force - The Wings of Honnêamise. He has also served as the special effects director for the Gamera: Guardian of the Universe, Gamera 2: Advent of Legion, and Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys films.
Yuusuke Watanabe (Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, live-action Gantz, Gantz II: Perfect Answer, 20th Century Boys, Gatchaman ) is writing the script. Film critic Tomohiro Machiyama, who is friends with original Attack on Titan manga creator Hajime Isayama, is also working on the scripts together with Isayama and Watanabe. Isayama himself has been present at business meetings for the film and has offered ideas on the scripts and characters.
The manga has has inspired four spinoff manga, and a 25-episode television anime version aired last year. Isayama launched the series in Bessatsu Shonen Magazine in 2009.

Tastemakers at the city's world-class museums or the art-world arrivistes who plunk down millions for a Picasso or Warhol give little respect to paintings sprayed on buildings, bridges or mailboxes. Vinny Pacifico wants to change that.
"I love graffiti," Mr. Pacifico said. "I love its energy. I love that it's part of the fabric and history of New York."The 60-year-old collector owns a meat-cutting and food-distribution empire in the Bronx with an estimated annual revenue of $1.5 billion—and in a 2,000-square-foot room near his office he maintains a private gallery packed floor-to-ceiling with hundreds of spray-painted murals by dozens of artists. His graffiti collection is surely one of the largest in the city, if not the nation."One day, people here are going to wake up to all this, just like they woke up 10 years ago and decided they wanted Kobe or organic beef," he said. "And when that time comes, I want the kind of market share in art that I now have in meat."Graffiti may well be the city's true indigenous art form, yet it remains shunned by New York collectors who regularly pay huge sums for contemporary works inspired by graffiti imagery. Indeed, the edgiest of art patrons can be fans of what's called street art and at the same time be foes of graffiti. That's because street art tends to look less improvised and is more politically minded, with critiques of state and corporate power. Taggers, meanwhile, spray-paint their names on surfaces in acts that seem less about self-expression and more about self-absorption, an urban update on the World War II street scribble "Kilroy was here."The main reason graffiti art sales have taken off elsewhere but not here may be psychological: To many New Yorkers, it symbolizes an era of blighted subways and decaying neighborhoods they'd rather forget. Ironically, gentrification may actually help the art form make a commercial impact as developers pay for a piece of New York's grittier past."There's still a stigma to this art in New York because so many people here lived through the hard times that spawned it," said Angelo Madrigale, director of contemporary art at auctioneer Doyle New York and organizer of the city's first graffiti auction three years ago. "The art is a very New York thing, but it's maligned."Not so in other global art capitals. Graffiti began crossing over to the commercial mainstream at a 1984 exhibition in Basel, Switzerland. Earlier this month, a painting by the notorious artist Banksy on a side of a trailer in Britain fetched about $680,000 at a Paris auction.One of the top collectors is U.S. businessman John Axelrod, whose townhouse is decorated with works by such New York artists as Crash, Dondi White and Lee Quinones, who in the 1970s painted more than 100 entire subway cars. The thing is, Mr. Axelrod lives in Boston.

June 5, 2014 Update: The presence of police officers in schools has increased dramatically in the last 20 years, and as a result, so has the number of students receiving misdemeanor and felony charges. African-American and Latino youth appear to bear the brunt of zero-tolerance policies and out-of-school suspensions. Fault Lines correspondent Wab Kinew traveled to Texas, where being late for class can get you sent to jail, to examine the difficulties of disrupting what the U.S. government now refers to as the school-to-prison pipeline. In January, as part of Getting Schooled, an America Tonight special series on some of the biggest issues in U.S. education, we looked at where and how the school-to-prison pipeline is playing out throughout the country. For a preview of the Fault Lines episode, tune in to America Tonight Thursday at 9 p.m. ET/6 PT. Catch the entire episode Saturday at 7 p.m. ET/4 PT. *** At a luncheon honoring Martin Luther King Day on Monday, NAACP attorney Monique Lin-Luse took the stage in Salt Lake City and urged the attendees to honor the iconic leader's legacy by taking on “one of the greatest civil rights challenges today.” She was talking about the school-to-prison pipeline. Minority students are more likely to be steered from graduation by harsh school punishments — suspensions, expulsions and even arrests — that leave them disaffected, more prone to drop out and entangled in the criminal justice system. The problem is so systemic that the Obama administration issued new recommendations on classroom discipline earlier this month, geared toward ending the gaping disparity. As part of this week's Getting Schooled series, correspondent Sarah Hoye traveled to Wake County, N.C., which advocates say has one of the largest school-to-prison pipelines in the country. What she uncovered is just a slice of what some researchers and educators argue has been going on around the country for years. How prevalent is the pipeline? And what's to blame? America Tonight broke it down.
In Wake County, 40 percent of black students caught with cellphones were suspended last year, compared with 17 percent of white students
Jason Langberg, the supervising attorney of Advocates for Children Services. America Tonight Jason Langberg, the supervising attorney of Advocates for Children Services, a project of Legal Aid of North Carolina, investigated the racial lopsidedness in student suspensions in Wake County. In an analysis of discipline data, he found that black students in the county's schools were suspended five times as often as their white peers. But he said there's no evidence to suggest that black students act up more often or more severely than white students. And this disparity is found not just in Wake County.

In the spring of 2012, a girl at Hinsdale South was caught smoking pot and confessed that she'd had three accomplices. The two girls in the group were suspended for five days; one boy denied the crime and wasn't suspended. The only black student in the group, however, was arrested and pleaded guilty to a drug ordinance charge. This is one example of a much larger trend in Chicago's schools, uncovered in a 2012 Chicago Tribune investigation. The newspaper found that school discipline was often inconsistent and even arbitrary and that black and Hispanic students were far more likely to be referred to police.
Nationally, black students are more than three times as likely to be suspended or expelled as their white peers

Across the country, the race gap in student punishments is enormous, according to Department of Education civil rights data from 2011 to 2012. Black students without disabilities, as they're broken down in the data, are suspended or expelled three times as often as white students without disabilities. Students with disabilities, often emotional or behavioral disorders, are also extremely overrepresented in the ranks of the suspended. The government study adds that this disparity can't be explained by more frequent or serious infractions by minority students. In a letter sent to school districts earlier this month, the Justice and Education Departments stated: “In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem.”
Since the 1970s, suspensions of black secondary school students have increased at 11 times the rate of white students
A truancy task force in Richmond, Va., checks school-age children. Truancy is one of the nonviolent offenses that now automatically trigger suspensions at many schools. Don Long/AP
Research has consistently shown that suspensions and expulsions have escalated dramatically since 1974, with disproportionately higher rates for minorities than their white peers. For example, a 2013 UCLA study of secondary school suspension found that the suspension rate increase of black students was 12.5 percentage points, compared with 1.1 percentage points for white students. Critics charge that the rise of zero-tolerance policies helped fuel this racial divide. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, fears of drugs and violence in public schools compelled many to institute quicker and harsher mandatory punishments for particular offenses such as drugs, violence, alcohol and tobacco. Over time, the policies were also widely instituted for minor infractions, like tardiness, disobedience and insubordination.
Ninety-five percent of suspensions in Indiana in 2002 to 2003 were for minor offenses
Today, pipeline critics often cite that 95 percent of suspensions are for minor infractions, a statistic can be traced back to this 2004 study in Indiana by the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy. According to the study, only 5 percent of suspensions in Indiana concerned a more serious offense — drugs, weapons, alcohol or tobacco — from 2002 to 2003. More than half were for disruptive behavior.
If a student is suspended in ninth grade, he's twice as likely to drop out of high school
Students walk down a hallway at Washington High School in Sioux Falls, S.D. Argus Leader/AP
Multiple studies have found that out-of-school suspensions act as a primary predictor of whether a student will drop out before graduation. Researchers determined that suspensions lead students to be more absent, fail more courses and become generally more disengaged from their academic careers. In a 2012 Johns Hopkins University analysis, researchers followed more than 180,000 Florida students from ninth grade through high school and beyond. They discovered that after just one suspension in ninth grade, a student's chances of graduating plummeted from 75 to 50 percent.
In Texas, police officers in schools write more than 1,000 misdemeanor tickets a year
A student from Gladys Porter High School in Brownsville, Tex. is handcuffed for excessive truancy. Christian Rodriguez/AP Hand in hand with the zero-tolerance movement, many schools began cooperating more intimately with police. Thousands of districts paid local police agencies to send armed officers into schools, often with federal subsidies. And after the shooting massacre in Newtown, Conn., the Department of Justice announced it would spend nearly $45 million to place more armed police in schools across the country — a move advocated by the National Rifle Association. Supporters of the policy say it makes schools safer, but critics are skeptical, arguing that its greatest impact has been an explosion of arrests and misdemeanor charges for nonviolent infractions. The Texas figure, reported in The New York Times, comes from Deborah Fowler, deputy director of the legal center Texas Appleseed, who said the charges leave kids with whopping legal costs and sometimes a lasting record.
An estimated 250,000s youth are tried, sentenced or incarcerated as adults every year in America
In the last few years, many states have moved to keep more young offenders in the juvenile justice system rather than put them in the adult system. But an enormous number of young offenders still wind up in the adult system, largely for nonviolent offenses. In New York and North Carolina, all 16- and 17-year-olds charged with a crime are automatically prosecuted as adults. This means students referred to police for a schoolyard scuffle or drug possession may face the full force of adult criminal justice — which could result in a record that could hurt their college and job prospects and disqualify them from financial aid. Without the support and counseling of juvenile facilities, studies show that these youths are more likely to become hardened criminals.
What motivates employees to do their jobs well? Competition with coworkers, for some. The promise of rewards, for others. Pure enjoyment of problem-solving, for a lucky few.
Increasingly, companies are tapping into these desires directly through what's come to be known as “gamification:” essentially, turning work into a game.
“Gamification is about understanding what it is that makes games engaging and what game designers do to create a great experience in games, and taking those learnings and applying them to other contexts such as the workplace and education,” explains Kevin Werbach, a gamification expert who teaches at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
It might mean monitoring employee productivity on a digital leaderboard and offering prizes to the winners, or giving employees digital badges or stars for completing certain activities. It could also mean training employees how to do their jobs through video game platforms. Companies from Google to L'Oréal to IBM to Wells Fargo are known to use some degree of gamification in their workplaces. And more and more companies are joining them. A recent report suggests that the global gamification market will grow from $1.65 billion in 2015 to $11.1 billion by 2020.
The concept of gamification is not entirely new, Werbach says. Companies, marketers and teachers have long looked for fun ways to engage people's reward-seeking or competitive spirits. Cracker Jacks has been “gamifying” its snack food by putting a small prize inside for more than 100 years, he adds, and the turn-of-the-century steel magnate Charles Schwab is said to have often come into his factory and written the number of tons of steel produced on the past shift on the factory floor, thus motivating the next shift of workers to beat the previous one.
But the word “gamification” and the widespread, conscious application of the concept only began in earnest about five years ago, Werbach says. Thanks in part to video games, the generation now entering the workforce is especially open to the idea of having their work gamified.
“We're at a point where in much of the developed world the vast majority of young people grew up playing [video] games, and an increasingly high percentage of adults play these video games too,” Werbach says.
A number of companies have sprung up—GamEffective, Bunchball and Badgeville, to name a few—in recent years offering gamification platforms for businesses. The platforms that are the most effective turn employees' ordinary job tasks into part of a rich adventure narrative.
“What makes a game game-like is that the player actually cares about the outcome,” Werbach says. “The principle is understanding what is motivating to this group of players, which requires some understanding of psychology.”
Some people, Werbach says, are motivated by competition. Sales people often fall into this category. For them, the right kind of gamification might be turning their sales pitches into a competition with other team members, complete with a digital leaderboard showing who's winning at all times.
Others are more motivated by collaboration and social experiences. One company Werbach has studied uses gamification to create a sense of community and boost employee morale. When employees log in to their computers, they're shown a picture of one of their coworkers and asked to guess that person's name.
Gamification does not have to be digital. Monica Cornetti runs a company that gamifies employee trainings. Sometimes this involves technology, but often it does not. She recently designed a gamification strategy for a sales training company with a storm-chasing theme. Employees formed “storm chaser teams” and competed in storm-themed educational exercises to earn various rewards.
“Rewards don't have to be stuffed,” Cornetti says. “Rewards can be flextime. Rewards can be extension time.”
Another training, this one for payroll law, used a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs theme. Snow White is public domain, but the dwarfs are still under copyright, so Cornetti invented sound-alike characters (Grumpy Gus, Dopey Dan) to illustrate specific payroll law principles.
Some people don't take as naturally to gamified work environments, Cornetti says. In her experience, people in positions of power or people in finance or engineering don't tend to like the sound of the word.
“If we're designing for engineers, I'm not talking about a ‘game' at all,” Cornetti says. “I'm talking about a ‘simulation,' I'm talking about ‘being able to solve this problem.'”
Gamification is “not a magic bullet,” Werbach cautions. A gamification strategy that's not sufficiently thought through or tailored to its players may engage people for a little while, but it won't motivate in the long term. It can also be exploitative, especially when used with vulnerable populations. For workers, especially low-paid workers, who desperately need their jobs yet know they can be easily replaced, gamification may feel more like the Hunger Games.
Werbach gives the example of several Disneyland hotels in Anaheim, California, which used large digital leaderboards to display how efficiently laundry workers were working compared to one another. Some employees found the board motivating. To others, it was the opposite of fun. Some began to skip bathroom breaks, worried that if their productivity fell they would be fired. Pregnant employees struggled to keep up. In a Los Angeles Times article, one employee referred to the board as a “digital whip.”
“It actually had a very negative effect on morale and performance,” Werbach says.
Still, gamification only stands to become more popular, he says, “as more and more people come into the workforce who are intuitively familiar with the structures and expressions of digital games.”
“We are way ahead of the tipping point,” Cornetti agrees. “There's no reason this will go away.”
The Columbus Blue Jackets will have to wait a little longer to get a good look at Sonny Milano.
Milano was forced to leave Friday's Traverse City Prospects Tournament game between Columbus and the Minnesota Wild after being pushed face-first into the boards during the first period. Blue Jackets president John Davidson confirmed Milano would miss the rest of the tournament on Saturday.
"It's a very minor, small fracture which is good news," Davidson told BlueJackets.com. "There is no surgery required for him. When you think of a time frame, it's really hard to tell. He will miss a little bit of time, but not a lot of time - it all depends on how it heals."
Milano will remain with the team and travel back to Columbus after the tournament to be assessed by team doctors.
"He's out of the tournament and we don't know anything beyond that," Davidson said. "I don't want to jump to any conclusions because we just don't know. He'll stay with us here but he won't be playing."
CAMP FOSTER, Okinawa — The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is probing a shooting that injured four U.S. servicemembers at Camp Schwab in northeast Okinawa, officials said.
No major injuries were reported, and all four are in stable condition, Marine Corps officials said in a statement.
The incident was reported to the Marine Corps Provost Marshal's Office around 10:45 a.m. Thursday, the statement said. The incident, which involved a 9 mm pistol, appears to have been caused by negligence.
The Marines said they could provide no other details while the situation is under investigation.
“The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is currently investigating the incident,” the statement said. “There exists no evidence at this time to indicate this was an intentional shooting, or a result of anything other than negligence.”

There was big news today that North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein is suing a drug company over the marketing of an opioid product to physicians.
This is part of a pattern that Stein has established. We can affectionately refer to it as Stein's Suit-of-the-Month.
He has sued the Trump Administration at least several times. One of his previous suits failed spectacularly when the Supreme Court allowed President Trump to bar refugees from terrorism-prone countries.
He has also sued Trump over his executive order to end the DACA amnesty even though the federal courts had previously ruled that Obama's DACA amnesty was illegal. And Stein's side is losing at the Supreme Court level on this issue thus far also.
Here is the problem. We have an attorney general who cavalierly flouts the rule of law, and who seeks to prevent the president from protecting American citizens. The concept of border security has many facets, but it is quite clear that Josh Stein opposes strengthening it.
Unfortunately, when we have poor border security, opioids flow freely across the border from Mexico. Opioids also flow from Muslim-majority countries around the Middle East; and it became clear this week that Obama prevented the interception of drugs from these countries before they might cross our southern border.
The legalization and marketing of marijuana in several western states has prompted the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico to increase opioid distribution in the United States because it experienced declining profits from marijuana.
But none of Stein's many lawsuits address securing the southern border and building a wall. His actions are entirely consistent with that of the national Democratic Party and the GOP establishment to undermine border security. That keeps the opioids flowing freely across the border.
Thus, Stein is a major league hypocrite. He creates a scene, making it appear that he is getting tough on private American companies marketing drugs in a suspect fashion. But that involves no heroics on his part, because going after the private sector is entirely consistent with his overall political philosophy and his worldview. Tightening the southern border decidedly is not.
He seemingly doesn't say a word about the western states that have legalized marijuana; and he certainly doesn't sue them. Oh, I forgot. That is a project sponsored by those within his own party.
I won't even discuss his religious and ethnic background, and how that might affect his tendency to oppose border security. That is apparently not allowed.
But my advice is to refrain from falling for Josh Stein's stunt. He is a deceiver.
JAMAL Idris could make a return to rugby league via Group 3 club Port City Breakers next season after expressing an interest to play alongside his cousin.
The Daily Telegraph spoke to Breakers coach Digby Murray, who confirmed the club's interest in the former NRL star but only if he was available and in the right mental state.
Murray said Breakers assistant coach and former Sharks and Roosters hooker Daniel Dumas has spoken to Idris about the possibility of lacing up the boots next year.
However, he stressed this was as far as the interest in the former Panthers, Bulldogs and Titans centre had gone.
Murray admitted Idris, who spent part of his youth in nearby Forster, would be a tremendous boost for the Breakers if he was keen to play.
That said, he revealed the 25-year-old had also mentioned plans to travel and the club wouldn't begrudge him if he decided to do so.
BIRD: Roberts always wanted to leave Titans
“Jamal has said he would like to play with his mates, but he is still undecided,” said Murray, who played two games for Parramatta in 1983.
“But it's all about Jamal though and he has obviously got other things on his mind at the moment.
“If it (a deal) does eventuate down the track that would be fantastic, but if not then that's fine too.
“The club would love to have him, but depends on where Idris is placed personally and we are more than happy with that.
“Our season doesn't start until April next year, so a lot could change between now and then as well and we'll just wait and see what happens.”

The president launched his attacks of Cruz early Saturday, accusing her of having poor leadership, and working with Democrats.
"Such poor leadership ability by the mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help," Trump tweeted.

The Trump administration has faced criticism over the past week for the slow movement of aid to the U.S. territory, which was left without power by the hurricane.
Cruz begged for help on Friday, and criticized the federal government's response to the crisis.
"I will do what I never thought I was going to do. I am begging, begging anyone who can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency," she said.
As I said hereÂ — and, earlier, here — the whole Syrian “nuclear” facility that the Israelis supposedly took out, in a faux-replay of the Osirak narrative, turned out to be a hoax:
“According to current and former intelligence sources, the US intelligence community has seen no evidence of a nuclear facility being hit. US intelligence ‘found no radiation signatures after the bombing, so there was no uranium or plutonium present,' said one official, wishing to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject. ‘We don't have any independent intelligence that it was a nuclear facility — only the assertions by the Israelis and some ambiguous satellite photography from them that shows a building, which the Syrians admitted was a military facility.'â€
Now that the IAEA is has the satellite photos, the truth is about to come out:
One of the diplomats indicated that the photos came from U.S intelligence. Two others said the images, which have been studied by experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency since being received on Thursday, do not at first examination appear to substantiate reports that the target was a nuclear installation, but emphasized that the images were still under examination.
The serial liars running our foreign policy don't care if theirÂ deceptions are exposed: the value of lying is the impression it leaves. Many heard about the Syrian “nukes,” few will notice the debunking.
DALLAS (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — Dallas police say a driver was killed when his vehicle crashed into a school building before classes started for the day on Tuesday.
Police did not immediately release the name of the driver who died in the fiery accident around 5:30 a.m.
Investigators are trying to determine what caused the vehicle, traveling at a high rate of speed, to hit a corner of a building at Uplift Heights Primary Preparatory School on Calypso Street. The vehicle burst into flames with the driver inside.
The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. No one else was injured.

California governor challenges GOP candidates on climate change
Jerry Brown (EPA/GIUSEPPE LAMI)
Democrats are also looking forward to Thursday's debate among the Republican presidential candidates -- and making demands.
California Gov. Jerry Brown, for example, released an open letter Wednesday asking the GOP candidates what they plan to do about climate change.
“Longer fire seasons, extreme weather and severe droughts aren't on the horizon, they're all here -- and here to stay," Brown said in his letter. "This is the new normal. The climate is changing. Given the challenge and the stakes, my question for you is simple: What are you going to do about it? What is your plan to deal with the threat of climate change?”
The GOP candidates gather Thursday in Cleveland.
In general, the Republicans have criticized President Obama's climate change plans as government overreach that will cut jobs in the energy sector and increase utility bills for middle class Americans.

In a flurry of often uncritical reporting, the University of Sheffield has announced it has found evidence of life beyond Earth, publishing its findings in the online Journal of Cosmology. Particles of material, recovered by a balloon from the stratosphere at an altitude of 27km, included a diatom fragment, a frustule, or "shell" if you like, of this most ubiquitous group of ocean and freshwater-dwelling micro-organisms.
These fragments, according to the study, seeded into the upper atmosphere by a comet and then collected by Earth-bound scientists, are proof that comets are a vehicle for life, a claim that has been a long-held view of one of the co-authors of the paper, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe. Professor Milton Wainwright, from the university's department of molecular biology and biotechnology, proposes this explanation based on a supposition that there are no known mechanisms for lofting terrestrial debris, including microbial matter, into the stratosphere. Even if fragments do get there, they would soon drop out.
Astrobiology is often afflicted by optimism about alien life. People want to believe that we are not alone. But the concern with this new claim is not that it is possibly another example of over-optimism but that it is inconsistent with one of the guiding principles of constructing a scientific hypothesis. It was William of Ockham, a 13th-century theologian and philosopher, who chanced across the idea of "parsimony". In everyday language, one should seek the simplest explanation for observations; the one with a minimum number of assumptions should be accepted until that simplicity can be traded in for greater explanatory force.
So here are some facts. The authors have observed a fragment of a diatom in the stratosphere. Diatoms are one of the most common type of water-dwelling organisms in the world. They are evolutionarily quite advanced. There is no fossil evidence for them before about 185 million years ago, although they may predate this time. From this, and other molecular evidence, they do not appear to be "deep-branching" – ancient lineages of life on the Earth.
These organisms are so common that they comprise the major fossilised component of "diatomaceous earth", a very crumbly material that is known to be atmospherically transported across the planet. The most prolific source of diatom dust, the Bodélé depression in Chad, sends the fragments of these ancient diatoms, laid down in ancient lakes, to Europe – there are a lot of dead diatoms floating around in the lower atmosphere. Further ephemeral facts to consider are that scientists estimate there are approximately 100 billion billion billion microbes on the Earth, not including diatoms, based on direct observations. To date we have not detected, unequivocally, a single active micro-organism beyond the Earth's atmosphere.
So the question is not whether there are alien fragments in the stratosphere. This can be determined by further experimentation. The scientific method will, ruthlessly and objectively, do this job over the coming years. Everything comes out in the wash eventually. Rather, the matter is whether, given our current state of knowledge, the most parsimonious and economical explanation for the observations reported is that the material is of extraterrestrial origin.
The question that Ockham would have demanded is this: is it more likely that our knowledge of particle transport from the lower atmosphere into the stratosphere is incomplete (like many areas of science) or that the microbes observed are alien denizens of passing comets?
You might ask why I haven't provided a long and detailed exposition of the various mechanisms by which diatoms and other microbial matter might float into the stratosphere in refutation of the Sheffield hypothesis. The answer is that one does not have to. Suppose we knew absolutely nothing about atmospheric transport processes. I suggest that the answer to the question above, given these facts, would still be the same – the most likely explanation, at the current time, is that our understanding of atmospheric transport processes is incomplete.
Why does the group that proposes these findings ignore Ockham so completely, igniting an international media frenzy on a claim of alien life that becomes pinned to British science and astrobiology? Probably because they are not testing a scientific hypothesis, but instead attempting to make data fit a pet theory that life has come to the Earth on comets. The scientific adage that has become a cliche – "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" – applies particularly to the claim of the discovery of extraterrestrial life. A fragment of diatom in the stratosphere is not extraordinary evidence for extraterrestrial life. It might be extraordinary evidence for poor science.
Help DC school kids cook, eat, and live healthier lives—kick-start our teaching kitchen!
(All donations are 100% tax deductible.)
Thanks to FRESHFARM Markets and its FoodPrints local foods program, we have made a huge impact on kids' attitudes toward growing and eating fresh, nutritious food. During the school year more than 200 first and third grade students at Watkins Elementary go home understanding good food can be fun, or as we like to say, “It's COOL to eat kale.” (click here to see a curriculum overview)
In order to expand the hugely popular FoodPrints program and reach more kids at Watkins Elementary School, we need a teaching kitchen—without it, we just can't offer more classes or reach more students.
Right now, our cooking classes are held in a regular classroom. We cook on portable hot plates, have no oven or dishwasher and wash our fresh garden produce in a tiny science lab sink. Before the school year starts in Fall 2011, we must transform our classroom space into a proper teaching kitchen. With your help we can do it.
Your support would provide vital funding to cover:
· Kitchen basics like handwashing sinks, ovens, dishwasher and countertops
· Induction cook top and display mirror so everyone can watch the cooking demonstration
· 100 square feet of shelving with grow lights to begin plants from seeds indoors
· Mobile, indoor composting unit
· Large kitchen island with child-height counters on one side to allow students to safely work near the cook top
Here's more info on our school, FoodPrints and FRESHFARM Markets
Watkins Elementary, a public school in Southeast Washington, D.C., benefits from FoodPrints, a local foods program funded by FRESHFARM Markets, a non-profit organization operating the largest network of producer-only farmers markets in DC, Maryland and Virginia.
FoodPrints has made it possible, along with the help of dedicated parents, school staff, and volunteers, to have our own garden right on school grounds. What makes FoodPrints so unique is how it integrates our delicious, edible garden produce into classroom lessons. Each two-hour class offers kids a chance to learn about ecology and plant biology, but it also instills in them an appreciation for the natural world and the joys of growing and harvesting food.
And of course—the cooking is fun and educational! Kids love the hands-on learning as each class ends with a cooking lesson and a simple, shared meal that each child helped prepare.
Our accomplishment so far:
· Built a 1700 square foot classroom kitchen garden with fence and outdoor classroom seating area
· Hired Jennifer Mampara, a part time teacher, to conduct and manage the FoodPrints program
· Jennifer has developed a year-long classroom curriculum that supports local and national science standards (By the end of this summer, the FoodPrints Curriculum will be finalized and available to the public on the FRESHFARM website at no charge. In the meantime, click here to see a curriculum overview.)
· Volunteer master gardener, Barbara Percival, cares for and manages our garden program
· Two parents donated their architectural services to create the design plan for the kitchen
· Another parent has pledged his firm's services for demolition and disposal to prepare for construction.
Our deadline is Wednesday, June 15th. Once we achieve our goal, we will announce the news to our students and teachers before they leave for summer break. That way, when they return to school in the fall, the kitchen will be fully operational!

The first thing to know about Bitcoin has nothing to do with how it works or what the current value of one is — of primary importance is the fanatical devotion Bitcoin users have to the mother of all cryptocurrencies. Many fans of Bitcoin promote the anonymous internet money at every turn, encouraging others to use it as a way to combat everything from government overreach to unethical banking practices. This is why cryptocurrencies are still a thing. Bitcoin enthusiasts scored a major victory when Overstock and Zynga started accepting Bitcoins recently, and that prompted one fan to start asking other internet companies what their plans were. Surprisingly, the one organization he got anywhere with was Google.
Updated: Google has since issued a statement that it isn't looking to incorporate Bitcoin — but as far as we can tell, the email conversation isn't being contested. Basically, Google probably is investigating Bitcoin, but isn't quite ready to publicly jump on the train.
It was an email to Google+ head honcho Vic Gundotra that got a response. Gundotra forwarded the message to the Google's commerce team, and a manager there confirmed that the company is indeed investigating how Bitcoin could be incorporated. Mountain View has been careful to say that there are no immediate plans to accept Bitcoin, but Ariel Bardin, VP of Google Payments did request the original emailer start a Google Moderator discussion to see what users wanted Google to do with Bitcoin. The entire exchange was detailed on the Bitcoin section of Reddit.
Bitcoin has been on a steady rise over the last year, more than doubling in value over a few months. Even recent law enforcement actions against Tor network sites (where Bitcoin is very popular) and China's crackdown on the currency haven't dampened enthusiasm much — a single Bitcoin is still worth over $900. A year ago one Bitcoin could be exchanged for a mere $20.
The question remains, what would Google do with Bitcoins? The overwhelming majority of Google's business comes from Adsense, so clearly taking payments for ads in Bitcoin would have the largest impact and would make Bitcoin fans extremely happy. However, Google has to police its Adsense content very well to keep scams and illegal goods out. Having a paper trail aids in accountability, but Bitcoin is anonymous by design. As such, Google's involvement with Bitcoin, if any, is likely to be more modest.
Now that the word is out, though, I expect Google to do something if only to get brownie points from privacy advocates. Google sells various consumer digital goods like apps, music, and books through Google Play, and many of the suggestions pouring into the Google Moderator page are asking the company to enable Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Google Wallet, and thus its entire content ecosystem. However, the act of paying 0.000012 BTC for an app lacks elegance, which is important in a consumer-facing venue like Google Play. Don't expect a Bitcoin logo will be popping up in the Play Store any time soon.
A solution that satisfies all parties might be to allow Bitcoin transfers directly into Google Wallet. It would be a quick way for users to make Bitcoins “real” and only requires that Google change one of its systems to accommodate virtual money. The Google Wallet debit card might finally get some traction as the fastest way to spend Bitcoins in the real world.
Rapid reversals of Earth's magnetic field 550 million years ago destroyed a large part of the ozone layer and let in a flood of ultraviolet radiation, devastating the unusual creatures of the so-called Ediacaran Period and triggering an evolutionary flight from light that led to the Cambrian explosion of animal groups. That's the conclusion of a new study, which proposes a connection between hyperactive field reversals and this crucial moment in the evolution of life.
The Kotlinian Crisis, as it is known, saw widespread extinction and put an end to the Ediacaran Period. During this time, large (up to meter-sized) soft-bodied organisms, often shaped like discs or fronds, had lived on or in shallow horizontal burrows beneath thick mats of bacteria which, unlike today, coated the sea floor. The slimy mats acted as a barrier between the water above and the sediments below, preventing oxygen from reaching under the sea floor and making it largely uninhabitable.
The Ediacaran gave way to the Cambrian explosion, 542 million years ago: the rapid emergence of new species with complex body plans, hard parts for defense, and sophisticated eyes. Burrowing also became more common and varied, which broke down the once-widespread bacterial mats, allowing oxygen into the sea floor to form a newly hospitable space for living.
Scientists have long argued over what caused the Cambrian explosion in the first place. Potential explanations have included rising levels of atmospheric oxygen because of photosynthesis, allowing for the development of more complex animals; the rise in carnivorous species and new predatory tactics, such as the flat and segmented, armor-crushing creatures known as anomalocaridids; and the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, which may have created new ecological niches and isolated populations as the continents drifted apart.
In their new study, however, geologist Joseph Meert of the University of Florida in Gainesville and his colleagues propose a different hypothesis: that these evolutionary changes might have been connected to rapid reversals in the direction of Earth's magnetic field. During a reversal, magnetic north and south trade places—an event which, in geologically recent times, occurs about once every million years.
Yet in the Ediacaran, such reversals were a lot more common, the team proposes. Certain minerals in rocks can preserve a record of the direction of Earth's magnetic field when the rock formed. While studying these magnetic records in 550-million-year-old, Ediacaran-aged sedimentary rocks in the Ural Mountains in western Russia, the team discovered evidence to suggest the reversal rate then was 20 times faster than it is today. “Earth's magnetic field underwent a period of hyperactive reversals,” Meert says.
Previous research has suggested that Earth's protective magnetic field would be weaker across such periods of frequent reversal, compromising its ability to shield life from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays. On top of this, the duration of each individual reversal episode—thought to take an average of 7000–10,000 years—would likely see the field temporarily weakened even more before growing back in the opposite direction.
This weakened shielding would have allowed more energetic particles into the upper atmosphere, which would have begun to break down the ozone layer that protects Earth from harmful UV radiation, Meert says. Twenty to 40% of ozone coverage might have been lost—in turn, doubling the amount of UV radiation that reached Earth's surface, the team reports in a paper in press in Gondwana Research. “Organisms with the ability to escape UV radiation would be favored in such an environment.”
This flight from dangerous levels of UV light, therefore, might explain many of the evolutionary changes that occurred during the Late Ediacaran and Early Cambrian, Meert says. Creatures with complex eyes to sense the light and the ability to seek shelter from the radiation—for example, by migrating into deeper waters during the daytime—would have been more successful. The growth of hard coatings and shells would afford additional UV protection, as would the capacity to burrow deeper into the sea floor.
In turn, these changes may have opened up new environments. The development of shells, for example, helps creatures colonize intertidal areas, protected not only from UV rays but also stronger waves and the risk of drying out. Similarly, the breakdown of the bacterial mats by early burrowing would have opened up the upper sea floor further for life.
Looking forward, the researchers are now hoping to examine other Ediacaran sediments from around the globe to verify the rapid reversals' signal, along with hunting for biological or chemical evidence for high doses of UV radiation in the fossil record.
There are many factors that may explain why the Cambrian explosion occurred, but the researchers' “escape from light” idea adds a novel possibility to the debate, says David Harper, a paleontologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the study. “The authors have opened up yet another exciting and imaginative area of research within which to frame and test new hypotheses for the origin and early evolution of animal-based communities.”
Geobiologist Joseph Kirschvink of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, is skeptical, however. Although the idea that UV radiation increases without Earth's magnetic field is long-established, its effect on the evolution of life at this time should be limited, he says, as the radiation would not be able to reach and damage the germ line, the cells of the body used in sexual reproduction to pass genetic information to offspring. The radiation “would affect the outer skin … but the germ cells are usually internal and protected.” As such, he argues, the idea that increased levels of UV radiation significantly affected the evolution of life in the Ediacaran is problematic.

„DACA ERAM IN ALTA TARA, NOI TOTI, ASTIA CU JEEPURILE, ERAM LUATI TOTI LA POLITIE, PANA ACUM, PENTRU ASA CEVA!” – un sofer de jeep privind bariera smulsa in cursul noptii 21/22 August 2013.
Da, aceasta este realitatea, asa este viata in orasul Busteni si in Parcul Natural Bucegi. Asa se prezinta unii politicienii din judetul Prahova. Bariera ce inchidea drumul spre Babele, a fost smulsa din beton. Ca si cum nu ar exista lege, ca si cum fiecare face ce doreste. Multi, probabil nu ati avut rabdare sa cititi sau nu ati crezut de cate ori v-am spus ca aici la Busteni, totul are o singura coordonata: fentarea legii.
Nimeni nu are ce sa-i faca primarului, el face orice doreste. Desi va fi greu de dovedit, el este acela care a dat ordinul sa fie smulsa bariera. Nimeni nu are autoritate asupra soferilor de jeep, decat el!
Impulsionat de Mircea Cosma, presedintele Consiliului Judetean Prahova, ce doreste sa inaugureze DJ 713 pe 31 august, considerat si numit „prietenul meu” de catre vicepremierul Gabriel Oprea , acest politician iresponsabil, fin al ministrului Liviu Dragnea, ajuns prin tot felul de tertipuri Primar al orasului Busteni, jongleaza cum vrea el cu institutiile statului.
In filmare se vad masini, toata lumea a parcat in afara barierei smulse, se vad turisti , soferi de jeep, se aude vocea unui prieten, ma intreba daca l-am sunat pe inspectorul Clementin de la Administratia Parcului. Nu l-am sunat, pentru ca nimeni in afara de Parchet, nu poate face nimic. Si tinand cont ca prim-procurorul Parchetului de pe langa Judecatoria Sinaia este prieten foarte bun cu primarul…
Pentru ca DJ 713 recent asfaltat se termina la intersectia cu Babele si Piatra Arsa, institutia ce administreaza Bucegii, pentru a stavili afluxul masiv de masini, a gasit oportun sa monteze o bariera acolo unde se termina drumul asfaltat. Potrivit legislatiei de mediu, mai departe, spre Babele, accesul motorizat este interzis, acela nefiind un drum public. Cu toate acestea, in lipsa unei bariere, cele mai multe masini urcau pana unde se putea…degradand zona de conservare speciala a ariei protejate. Deja masinile ajungeau pana deasupra Crucii de pe Caraiman…se impunea o astfel de masura.
DJ 713 este un drum care se termina la o intersectie, si pe care intr-o saptamana de vara circula mii de masini, acestea umbla necontrolat printr-un Parc Natural, sit Natura 2000 din anul 2007. Au dorit doar sa ia bani din asfaltari si sa accesibilizeze terenurile din preajma drumului…o lovitura imobiliara. Cine ajunge la capat de drum nu are ce sa faca, nu stie unde sa mearga, nu exista un panou informativ, vreun obiectiv turistic. Nimic! Au asfaltat muntele, le trebuia pretext sa cheltuiasca banii statului!
Dupa cum stiti, pe 22 august trebuia sa se faca o repetitie la Crucea de pe muntele Caraiman. Sa lanseze noaptea artificii Mircea Cosma, sa vada el cum iese. Smecherul de la Busteni, a pus oameni sa elibereze drumul, adica lor, sa le vorbesti de lege? Ei care conduc mii de oameni, sa se impiedice de o bariera? Ei sa respecte legile cand ei fac legea, a lor lege??
Nu pot sa cred ca au smuls acea bariera, fiecare stalp era rasucit, scos din pamant si beton. Oare ce trebuie sa mai faca acest nenorocit ca legea, legea adevarata, sa-l ia la intrebari?!
Nu pot sa cred, si mi-au dat lacrimile atunci cand nu m-a vazut nimeni, ca poti sa calci in picioare cu atata grosolanie si marsavie, autoritatea statului, orice lege, orice institutie. Ma chinui de ore bune sa insailez acest articol, sunt socat, cuvintele imi vin greu, pentru ca stiu ca nimeni nu le va pune o intrebare, nimeni nu va misca un deget. Ei sunt legea!
Am muncit la bariera aceea, alaturi de reprezentantii Administratiei Parcului Natural Bucegi, din dorinta de a pastra cat mai bine aceasta arie protejata. Cu gandul ca autoritatea statului primeaza in fata actelor de tip infractional. Impreuna cu Jandarmeria s-au luat masuri de stopare a accesului cu jeepul spre Babele. Au stat jandarmii in ploaie, vant, au risipit combustibil. Politia Rutiera pe de alta parte, a dat un aer de legalitate pe Dj 713. Totul in zadar!
Jandarmeria Montana oprind traficul ilegal spre Babele
Administratia Parcului Natural Bucegi lucrand la montarea barierei…din dorinta de a mai ramane ceva din acest munte
Vine azi 22 august, Mircea Cosma, presedintele Consiliului Judetean Prahova si promite ca face parcari, drumuri nu stiu de care, fara sa-si dea sema ce spune. Platoul Bucegilor nu are acelasi statut ca si lanul de porumb de la periferia Ploiestiului. Fara sa ia in seama ca nu exista baza legala pentru asa ceva, fara sa-i pese ca incalca legislatia de mediu. Pentru a-i netezi accesul, acolitii sai din Busteni au trecut la smulgerea barierei de la capatul lui DJ 713. Sa poata sa fie distrus si ce a mai ramas din acest Parc Natural. Este limpede, mafia a invins statul la scor de neprezentare. Parchetului, Politiei, Jandarmeriei, le este teama sa se atinga de persoane de un asemenea calibru. Legea nu este pentru ei.
Unii au muncit, altii au ordonat ca legea sa fie scoasa din Bucegi
Toate aceste masini, o sa le vedeti prin preajma Babelor, a Sfinxului…nu pentru a dezvolta vreun turism, ci pentru a da drumul la lucrari de asfaltare, sa mai faca si altii un ban, adica tot ei, initiatorii.
Poate ca nu intelegeti ce insemna acea bariera in Parcul Natural Bucegi. Era limita, era legea sau daca vreti era „linia frontului”. Pana unde ai voie sa mergi, pana unde ai voie sa faci ce vrei. Era acel ceva ce arata ca in acest munte se doreste pastrarea patrimoniului natural. Niciun sofer de jeep, nu a desconsiderat acel simbol al legii. O mai luau prin jnepenii de la Piatra Arsa, mai treceau dupa ora 17 pe dupa bariera, dar nimeni nu a indraznit sa o smulga.
Acesti doi politicieni iresponsabili, situati deasupra legii, au subminat printr-un gest tot ceea ce alte institutii ale statului au creat. Si nimeni nu-i va trage la raspundere in vreun fel. Am fost surprins si de atitudinea soferilor de jeepuri. Foarte putini, cativa, izolati, au trecut de bariera smulsa. Pana si ei, desi acum drumul este liber pana la Babele, erau socati de un asemenea abuz. Nu poti sa dispretuiesti legea de o asemenea maniera. Sa le ceri unor soferi sa traga cu cablul stalpii barierei. Nu stiu cati realizati dimensiunea unui astfel de gest, de o mare gravitate.
Cei de la Parcul Natural, jandarmii, padurarii, comisari de mediu, toti sunt socati. Nu poti face asa ceva intr-o tara considerata civilizata. Cat de infractor sa fii, sa smulgi o bariera ce reprezenta legea in Parcul Natural Bucegi?
Priviti ingineri silvici manuind lopata. Pentru ca si altii sa se bucure de frumusetile muntelui, nu sa le distrugem urcandu-ne pe ele, cu masinile. Munca unor oameni cu studii superioare distrusa de niste inculti..
Statul este evident ca nu functioneaza. Peste noapte un grup de infractori au schimbat statutul unui munte si nu li se intampla nimic. Nu pot accepta asta, stiu ca nu vor pati ceva. Deja acest mincinos, Mircea Cosma, a declarat azi ca drumul este asfaltat pana la Babele. Asa a spus si acum o saptamana, ca se deschide drumul din Valea Doftanei la Busteni si ca Politia va pune curand semne de circulatie…insa acel drum nu este practicabil, nu exista ca drum, am scris in 12 august despre acest lucru. Mai toate site-urile de stiri, au preluat poze si parti din articolul publicat de mine, realizand dezmintiri. Acest personaj, presedinte de Consiliu Judetean, nu a fost tras la raspundere pentru aceasta dezinformare. Nici nu va fi, pentru ca incet-incet puterea va fi acaparata de astfel de persoane si vom trai intr-un stat mafiot.
Mi-am asumat in timp orice risc, am fost urmarit de zeci de soferi de jeepuri, s-au facut felurite planuri cum sa fiu batut si aruncat prin prapastii, impuscat sau spanzurat, ingropat pe nu stiu unde. Am avut nenumarate sicane si eu si cei apropiati mie. Nu mi-a fost teama si nici nu imi este. Daca imi era, faceam altceva. Cred intr-o societate normala, unde oricine poate face orice, cat timp respecta legile si nu-l deranjeaza pe celalalt. Am mers mai departe pe munte, singur de multe ori. Cred in Dumnezeu, cred in ce fac, cred in mine…nu mi-a fost teama o secunda pentru viata mea. Nici atunci cand ma asteptau cu masina prin jnepenii de la Piatra Arsa. Am refuzat tot felul de avantaje materiale, as fi putut sa fac altceva, sa obtin multi bani…
Pentru mine, alte lucruri sunt importante. Nu ma astept sa ma inteleaga, sa ma creada cineva. O clipa nu mi-am inchipuit ca sistemul mafiot poate surclasa atat de evident legea. Daca poti calca legea in picioare, de o asemenea maniera, nu mai are rost altceva. Deja nu mai tine de mine, de Administratia Parcului, de Ministerul Mediului…oamenii acestia ar trebui imediat arestati preventiv.
Am o singura bucurie…ca ploua! In aceasta seara ploua. Banditii nu au reusit sa faca o repetitie la Crucea de pe Caraiman, sa lanseze artificii…
Si o intrebare pentru autoritatile statului:
ISI MAI FACE CINEVA DATORIA PRIN TARA ASTA????
Au legat cabluri de bariera si au tras cu jeepul, pana au smuls-o din pamant si beton. Gravitatea faptei i-a socat pana si pe soferii de jeepuri. Bariera era la pamant, data in laturi si totusi cei mai multi nu treceau. Se uitau socati! Va dati seama ce se intampla? Nu am de unde sa stiu in ce masura, va dati seama! Astazi, 22 august, legea si reprezentantii sai au fost scosi din Parcul Natural Bucegi. De fapt, nici arie protejata nu mai este, este un teren la dispozitia unora. O mana de delicventi aplica de azi inainte, in Bucegi, legea…legea lor. Prin forta, amenintari si presiuni, orice reprezentant al statului a fost determinat la inactiune. Mafiotii pot face orice…se poate intampla orice.
Comentariile sunt libere, nu mai sunt in asteptare. Poate mai scriu, poate nu, poate sterg din comentarii sau nu, nu stiu ce voi face, probabil astept, voi mai vedea. Am auzit in seara aceasta, oameni care au facut puscarie, comentand subiectul. Unul nu a spus ca se bucura de smulgerea barierei. Toti care aud si care realizeaza dimensiunile unui astfel de gest, sunt consternati…pentru ca toti isi dau seama ce inseamna acest lucru…absenta legii, instaurarea unui regim personal, tehnici mafiote. Iti dai seama, ca orice ai fi, om cinstit sau hot, nu mai esti liber, legea pe aici, fiind…cate unii.
Deja este trecut de ora 2 noaptea, am scris in multe ore…suntem deja in 23 august!

Am primit informatia ca postul de jandarmi montani al judetului Dambovita refuza sa trimita patrule la acea bariera smulsa. Le este teama! Iata ce fac declaratiile unor politicieni iresponsabili.
Cine doreste ii poate suna pe jandarmi si intreba de ce nu vin la acea bariera? Sau le poate scrie sefilor lor la: „contact@jandarmeriadambovita.ro”
Fiti siguri ca exista cineva care pozeaza intersectia periodic si nu vor putea minti, spunand ca au fost acolo.
De asemenea, va rog, daca ajungeti in zona acelui drum, filmati sau pozati masinile care intra. Daca aveti curaj si vedeti oamenii ai legii amendand, nu ezitati sa va puneti martori. Oamenii acestia si asa sunt timorati. Asta daca o fi cineva pe acolo…

CLOSE At Disney's D23 Expo, stars of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" shared their excitement for the newly announced 'Star Wars' theme park attractions.
'Star Wars'-themed lands are coming to Disney Parks. (Photo11: Disney)
ANAHEIM, Calif. — Ever wanted to hang out in the sleazy cantina from Star Wars? Or itched to fight on the Millennium Falcon? Visualize it.
Disney chairman Bob Iger announced the creation of two-Star Wars theme lands coming to the Disney parks in Orlando and Anaheim, Calif. Iger made the announcement before a rabid crowd at the biennial Disney D23 Expo Saturday morning.
The concept received a rousing standing ovation from the 8,000 fans gathered.
The parks will allow Star Wars fans to step into the stories and interact with the characters from a galaxy far, far away. They will be transported to a never-before-seen planet, a remote trading port filled with Star Wars characters.
The plans to bring Star Wars to life in the two parks include creating Disney's largest single-themed land expansions ever at 14 acres each.
"We are creating a jaw-dropping new world," said Iger. "We're bringing Star Wars to life in a big way. ...These new lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet.
"Nothing in land will be out of character," added Iger, including the famed cantina. "You've never seen a cantina like this before."
The locations will also allow guests to ride the Millennium Falcon in a "climactic battle."
"Guests will truly become part of a Star Wars story," said Iger. "It's going to be a whole new level, a whole new galaxy."

The news was even exciting to Star Wars: The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams, who talked longingly about hanging out with droids and riding the Millennium Falcon.
"It's really pushing what you thought was possible in terms of an amusement park experience," Abrams said backstage at D23. "When you see what they're working on in these parks your mind is going to be blown. And it's really fun for anyone who likes Star Wars. I think they're gonna have an experience they'll never forget."
Oscar Isaac, who plays an X-wing Fighter pilot in The Force Awakens, warned that he hopes the experience is not too real.
"Don't eat up to two hours before flying an X-wing," said Isaac. "From experience, I say don't do that."
No timeline was given for the additions, but park attendees will be able to experience more Star Wars even before the themed lands are ready.
At the Disney Parks panel Saturday afternoon, Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Bob Chapek said that fans will experience Star Wars updates to pre-existing rides. As part of Disney's 2016-Star Wars: Season of the Force event, popular indoor roller coaster Space Mountain will transform into Hyperspace Mountain.
More Star Wars attractions coming soon: The 3D simulator Star Tours will include new characters from The Force Awakens, there will also be a new Star Wars Launch Bay for guests to peek behind the scenes of movies and play games, and a reimagined Jedi Training Camp with new characters from Star Wars Rebels.

Today's question: The Green Bay Packers have won the NFC North for four consecutive years. What will it take for them to be supplanted as division champ?
Rob Demovsky, Packers: Their division foes could start by actually winning in Wisconsin; that hasn't happened for the Lions since 1991. One game doesn't make a division winner, but it's emblematic of what has held back the Lions in their quest for a division title. The first thing Packers coach Mike McCarthy emphasizes every season is winning division games. He has created a culture in which those weeks leading up to division contests take on a special feeling. The Packers have won 65.6 percent of their division games in McCarthy's nine seasons. That is well ahead of the Bears, who have the second-best division mark at 54.2 percent in that stretch. The Packers are even more dominant at home against division foes, winning 75.7 percent of those games under McCarthy. The Vikings are second at 61.1 percent during that same period. Notice that the Lions aren't second-best in either category.
Jeff Dickerson, Chicago Bears: It would take an injury to Aaron Rodgers. That's the only way I envision any NFC North team consistently beating Green Bay. But even when Rodgers has been hurt, good fortune seems to smile on the Packers -- like in 2013, when Green Bay still won the division despite Rodgers missing seven games after Shea McClellin broke his collarbone. Not even the lone highlight of McClellin's career could keep the Packers out of the playoffs. Amazing. Now I firmly believe the Vikings, and maybe the Bears, will be better in 2015. But I just don't see any of the three squads supplanting Green Bay until Rodgers retires. Brett Favre played 20 years. Rodgers is entering his 11th season. It might be a long time before the balance of power in the NFC North shifts outside of Green Bay.
Ben Goessling, Minnesota Vikings: The key to beating the Packers has been the ability to pressure Rodgers without sending extra pass-rushers. That's how the New York Giants shut the Packers down in the playoffs after Green Bay went 15-1 in 2011. And even with Rodgers hobbled by a leg injury in the NFC title game, the Seahawks only blitzed him on nine of his 34 pass attempts. To supplant Green Bay, you've got to keep up with them in the division and probably steal one of the head-to-head matchups with them. The Vikings might actually be the team with the defensive formula to do it, especially if the additions to their secondary pan out.
“Professional pundits” who appear heavily in the media should be given time limits on air, says Canadian author and activist Naomi Klein.
"US presidents are restricted to eight consecutive years in office, so why do people who shape political opinion appear to have jobs for life?"
As the usual suspects take up ever more air time ahead of the NZ election, could Klein's suggestion be a good idea here?

What a week it's been for punditry in New Zealand.
Long-serving pundits like Chris Trotter were rolled out to pronounce on the political upheavals in the Labour Party and the media scrambled to find pundits to comment on the so-called 'Jacinda Effect'.
But in New Zealand it's not so much the length of service of the pundits that's striking; it's the fact that a handful of them feel almost omnipresent.
And when it comes being everywhere Mike Hosking is in a league of his own. He's not so much a pundit as a production line of reckons.
Most mornings he blasts out a couple of strongly worded opinion pieces on his Newstalk ZB breakfast show – one of which is re-worked into one of his 'Mike's Minutes' on the NZ Herald's website – and night after night he ends TVNZ's Seven Sharp with yet more strident opinions.
It doesn't matter the topic: Hosking has a strongly held view on it.
So how does one person – juggling so many gigs – come to have such definitive opinions on... well, everything?
It's as if Hosking resides in the Nirvana envisaged by former Prime Minister Mike Moore when he said he wanted New Zealand to be a net exporter of knowledge. It's one of those quips that sounds good until you give it a second's thought.
If there's a pundit that comes close to Hosking in terms of being everywhere, it's Matthew Hooton.
Unlike Hosking, he's neither a professional broadcaster nor a journalist but a political lobbyist and former National Party staffer.
Hooton is a political insider who often claims to have insider knowledge from both the right and the left of the political divide.
Last Tuesday he told RNZ's Kathryn Ryan that Helen Clark and Michael Cullen had been calling Labour MPs on behalf of Jacinda Ardern.
The next morning Duncan Garner asked Ardern about that on Three's AM Show.
"Helen's in Europe so I think it's very unlikely that she would have given up her holiday to start making phone calls for little old me," Ardern said.
Another person who was sceptical of the claim was Tim Murphy of the Newsroom website, who tweeted:
"Hooton claiming on @ninetonoon Helen Clark and Michael Cullen calling MPs on behalf of Jacinda. Seems so implausible to be implausible."
To which Clark replied:
"Complete and utter rubbish as you surmised. Fake news in the real sense."
Hooton climbed into Twitter with this riposte:
Photo: RNZ
"More implausible would be that Helen Clark wouldn't get involved in a @nzlabour spill. Tim owes me an apology."
Mediawatch gave Sir Michael Cullen a ring to see if he could shed any light on the question.
He told us that Matthew Hooton was half right and then added: "Not bad for Matthew."
The former deputy prime minister said he'd rung a reasonable number of MPs encouraging them to appoint Adern but wouldn't be more specific than that.
And Hooton often brings an insider's knowledge to his punditry – no-one else seemed to be aware of Cullen's lobbying.
But as the managing director of Exeltium – which boasts on its website that it's New Zealand's most successful corporate and public affairs consultancy – listeners can't but wonder whose barrow Hooton is pushing.
So as appealing as Naomi Klein's suggestion of a term limit for pundits might be it doesn't deal with the main problem in New Zealand, which is that a small pool of pundits – many of them working in the field of public relations – hog the public soapbox.
RNZ, ZB, TVNZ, Radio Live and TV3 all share the same pundits. It's time for more diversity.
Japan is the world's 7th largest beer producer, and beer and beer-like beverages accounted for 67% of Japan's 9 billion liters of alcohol consumption in 2006. Until 1994, Japanese tax laws, enacted to protect domestic brewing, set minimum production limits that instead ensured the dominance of the big four breweries Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory. Combined, they account for 99% of all beer sold nationally.
However, when those minimums were lowered from two million liters/year to 60,000 liters/year, it opened the door for craft brewing to emerge in the land of the rising sun. Since then, a fledgling, but vibrant scene has developed, and Yo-Ho Brewing in Nagano is a leading player.
Yo-Ho was founded in 1996 by Keiji Hoshino, who drank his first craft beer in the United States while he was an exchange student, and quickly discovered how bad most Japanese beer was. According to Yo-Ho's president, Naoyuki Ide, the brewery sees itself as being more like an American craft brewery than any of its Japanese counterparts. Their focus has been almost entirely on ale production since the first batch was brewed in 1997, and their intended customer is "the general beer drinking consumer," as opposed to other small breweries which primarily sell locally to tourists.
Many of the brewery's current styles were developed by former head brewer Toshi Ishii, who honed his craft at Stone Brewing in California. He has since left Yo-Ho, and started his own brewery, Ishii Brewing Company, in Guam.
According to Ide, Yo-Ho maintains a very strong emphasis on quality control, focusing on natural carbonation and the use of their own yeast strands in the brewing process. The brewery uses slightly harder water than most, since it's located on the foothills of volcanic Mt. Asama, which Ide claims "adds to the depth of our beer flavors."
The company is expanding its presence in Japan and abroad. Many larger Japanese retailers have started selling craft beer, and Yo-Ho will also soon be opening a brewpub in Tokyo's Akasaka district. According to Toshi Kojima of Seattle-based importer BeverageTraders (who also kindly provided translations for this article,) Yo-Ho currently exports to Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States, where they primarily ship to the west coast, but are in the process of signing on with a new east coast distributor.
What do the beers taste like? I sampled a few, including their newest release, a Belgian White called Suiyoubi no Neko. My thoughts are below.
Suiyoubi no Neko
Fairly smooth, faintly fruity, with hints of banana and citrus, Suiyoubi no Neko is a simple and unassuming Belgian Wheat. In addition to the fruit, it tastes yeasty and unfiltered, as is common for the style, despite not being very cloudy (I could see my fingers through the glass.) I wouldn't necessarily seek this out over, say, Hoegaarden, but it's light, refreshing, and well-executed, just right for serving with sashimi or salads. Also, I really like the cat on the can (Suiyoubi no Neko translates to "Wednesday Cat.")
Yona Yona
Yo-Ho's American-style Pale Ale is fairly hoppy and bitter. But it's smooth and it has a certain sweetness, with some hints of citrus, and even a little maple and honey. Yona Yona translates to "Every Day," and indeed, this beer was intended to be drinkable on a regular basis. Like Suiyoubi no Neko, it's not a tremendously innovative beer, but it's a really well-excecuted version of the style. Drink it with katsu curry or ramen.
Aooni
Indo no Aooni, which translates to 'Blue Demon of India', is an English-style IPA, and a bit stronger than Yona Yona at 7% instead of 5.5% ABV. It's a bit less sweet than the pale, with lingering earthy hops, though fans of American IPAs won't find it super hoppy. Drink it with a big cheeseburger and French fries.
Tokyo Black
The first note I wrote down when I started drinking this was "f***ing outstanding porter." There's really not that much more that needs saying. This one is black as night; a heavy, sludgy pour even though it's only 5% alcohol. It's smooth, smoky, and roasty—the beer tastes bittersweet, with a lot of coffee and a little bit of chocolate and vanilla in the mix. This is a porter of the highest order, in my opinion. Pair it with smoked meats or cheeses, or try it with a steak.
What's Next for Japanese Beer?
Most of Yo-Ho's beers wouldn't really stand out in today's vibrant American craft beer scene, but in the Japanese beer market, they're miles beyond what's commonly sold. And when you consider that America's first popular craft beers debuted long before Japanese deregulation and Yo-Ho's first batches, the future looks very bright for Japanese beer and this unique Nagano brewery. Now please, beer me a Tokyo Black.

Another 20 troops will be sent to Baghdad to advise Iraqi military leaders. A spokesman for the French Chief of the Defense Staff confirmed to VICE News that 20 "experts" would be deployed at a later date, with the mission to "advise on planning and logistics."
The new deployment is forecasted to last at least three months, and will consist of two separate operations. Two operational training units of around ten troops each will be dispatched to Erbil and Baghdad to deliver a three-month training program to Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers fighting alongside coalition forces. Their first order of business will be to train Iraqi forces to respond to the rapidly escalating threat of improvised explosive devices — the homemade bombs and landmines favored by Islamic militants to attack military convoys. IEDs are currently the "main issue" faced by Iraqi troops, according to former air force general and former French defense ministry advisor Michel Asencio.
French army spokesman Gilles Jaron announced the deployment at a press conference on Thursday, emphasizing that the French troops are being deployed in an advisory role. They are not expected to be "confronting the enemy directly," he said. Canadian army officials recently revealed that Canadian troops had been involved in a gunfire exchange with Islamic State fighters.
Over the coming weeks, France will boost its support of the battle against the Islamic State terror group by dispatching an extra 40 soldiers to train Iraqi forces in Baghdad and Kurdish peshmerga forces stationed in the Kurdish capital of Erbil in northern Iraq .

The French army sent a dozen special forces personnel to Erbil last August to train Kurdish fighters in the operation of machine guns and artillery. It launched Operation Chammal the following September, an ongoing military operation to contain the expansion of the Islamic State and support the Iraqi army. The mission, currently mobilizes 800 troops and consists mainly of airstrikes, is part of the international coalition's efforts in the region.
Nine French Rafale aircraft are stationed at the Al Dhafra air base in the United Arab Emirates, while six of the country's Mirage jets are based in Jordan. France has also sent an anti-aircraft frigate to the Persian Gulf, and recent reports have indicated that the country's flagship aircraft carrier, the Charles-de-Gaulle, could join operations in the region in the coming months.
It could take two years to defeat the Islamic State, says UK Foreign Secretary. Read more here.
Defense expert Jean-Pierre Maulny, the deputy director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Relations (IRIS), explained to VICE News that the French army will carry out three different training programs.
The first, he said, is "leadership training, and guidance on how to organize a unit training around its command" — in other words, smoothing out any authority issues between junior officers and army commanders. The second involves equipment training. In the third component, French forces will provide training in line with France's military doctrine, sharing general strategic expertise and military knowledge with the Iraqi army.
The French army is following in the footsteps of the United States. There are currently some 2,000 American troops stationed in Iraq to train and advise the country's security forces and help them carry out more precise airstrikes against the enemy. US Gen. Dana Pittard remarked to AFP earlier this month that the campaign's aim was "to train confident and competent combat forces."
Maulny expects the US-French training coalition will work closely together to avoid any overlap and to share responsibilities.
"The Americans and the French will divide up the workload," he said. "Training will not be standardized, since both militaries have different military doctrines."
Maulny described the effort as assisting the development of Iraqi forces, which when sufficient will allow foreign troops to withdraw.
"It's what we did in Mali," he said. "The army comes in like a fireman to extinguish the blaze, and then trains units that are then able to secure and defend their own territory."
French lawmakers vote overwhelmingly to continue attacking the Islamic State. Read more here.
He drew a parallel with the Afghan army, which in 2008 had only 70,000 soldiers. Today it has 250,000 troops.
Asencio said that it is crucial for the Iraqi army to unify its military.
"We've been trying to train the Iraqi army for 10 years," he remarked, "and we have no intention of staying there 20 years."
He described the peshmerga and Iraqi forces as "excellent fighters when they operate in small tribe-like groups of 150. However, the Iraqi army has a very hard time managing a regiment of 1,500 troops. We must start by training a squad [of a few soldiers] before moving on to an entire regiment, to ensure a cohesive army."
The main priority in Iraq, Asencio added, is to "train police officers in order to re-establish security and regain the people's trust." But the former general thinks that simply having aircraft and an army is not enough to accomplish the task at hand.
"We need to provide the people with a sense of security," he said. "These regions are being threatened from within their borders, hence the importance of a well-trained and efficient police force."
Another prime concern is strengthening the country's intelligence services.
"We need human intelligence in order to infiltrate the jihadist group," Asencio emphasized. "Having boots on the ground will allow us to carry out more precise airstrikes and avoid collateral damage."

At first, Marine Sgt. Jon Gordon didn't exactly jump at the chance to learn to train a service dog. When he returned from Afghanistan, where he was injured driving over roadside bombs, he said, "I was where my head hurt so bad that I didn't want to do anything. I stayed in my room — I didn't like talking to people — I didn't go out." Then Gordon met Birdie, a Labrador Retriever from Warrior Canine Connection, a nonprofit that teaches veterans with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress to train service dogs for other veterans — and everything changed.
How Training Dogs Retrains Veterans
The idea behind WCC is that training dogs is healing for the trainers. The first step in the process is socializing the puppies, getting them out and about so they'll become accustomed to daily life. That's also a first step for a veteran like Gordon, who was isolating himself. When he started working with Birdie, he found that the dog made it easier to interact with people.
"Having a dog with you, it's kind of like a safe buffer when people come up and talk to you," says Gordon. "It's 'Oh, you've got a cute dog, what does it do?' not 'What are your injuries, what's wrong with you?'"
But human contact isn't the only part of the process that's valuable for the trainers. A service dog must learn to be comfortable around crowds and calm in the face of unexpected loud noises — which can also be difficult for someone who's been injured in battle.
"Startling events or loud noises are often triggers for the veterans we work with," says Rick Yount, executive director of WCC. "To teach the dog that a car backfiring is a good thing, you have to challenge your own automatic distorted thinking that it's maybe an IED. To teach the dog that the world is safe, you have to sort of convince yourself of that."
Yount first created a service-dog training therapy program called Paws for Purple Hearts as part of his master's thesis work in 2008. Since 2010 he's been working with veterans in the PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury research and treatment center at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence in Bethesda, Md. In 2011 he joined WCC, where he continues to focus on that work.

Yount says that one very basic principle of training turns out to be part of the healing process: To effectively praise a dog, you've got to sound like you mean it. This is therapeutic for soldiers suffering from the emotional numbness that comes with post-traumatic stress. "You have to at least pretend to sound happy," says Yount. "Having service members who are emotionally numb doing that, it really kind of pulls affect out of them."
Learning to use that happy tone of voice is hard for most people the first time they take a dog training class, but it's even more of a challenge for these injured vets. What inspires them to try, Yount believes, is the fact that they're helping other veterans. "That core value system of taking care of your own is a very powerful motivator."
Another goal of WCC is to conduct brain science research to get hard data on how interacting with and training dogs affects people with brain injury and PTSD. One of their planned projects will examine sleep problems, another common symptom experienced by the veterans in the program.

Many commuters will recognise the moment. You're standing on a packed bus or in a crowded carriage, and you feel a hand rub against your thigh. Was it just an accident? After all, you're squished in so tight you can tell the man standing next to you showers with lime Radox and just ate a bag of Cool Original Doritos. But then those fingers edge slightly higher...
When I asked for tales about sexual harassment on public transport, I was inundated. Londoners reported being leered at, catcalled, followed, flashed and groped — all on the daily commute.
A student travelling on the Central line in rush hour felt a man rub his erection against her leg. Then there was the literary agent on a busy bendy bus who suddenly realised a teenage boy was putting his hand up her skirt; when her boyfriend understandably made a scene, a much older man told him to shut up because she was “asking for it” and she was “a slag”.
Then there was the woman on the last train from Richmond to Waterloo who thought the man opposite her was snoring — when she looked up, she realised he was actually groaning: his fly was open and he was masturbating.
Currently, police are appealing for witnesses to a sexual assault at Aldgate East station in March, when a man wearing a multi-coloured jacket boarded a District line train and harassed and assaulted female passengers. This list could go on. And on. And on.
A 2012 YouGov survey for the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) found that 43 per cent of women in London aged between 18 and 34 had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces during the previous year. And the capital's Tube, rail and bus networks are prime hunting grounds for the capital's creeps and gropers.
Between July 2013 and April, there was a 27 per cent jump in the number of sexual offences reported on public transport, with 936 cases, compared with 737 a year earlier. However, this rise coincides with a campaign by the British Transport Police, Project Guardian, to raise awareness of harassment and to encourage victims to report crimes. The number of suspects arrested and charged or cautioned has also risen by 22 per cent in this period, to 358.
Project Guardian is run in conjunction with the Met, TfL and the City of London Police, and has taken advice from women's groups EVAW, the Everyday Sexism Project and Hollaback London, the capital's branch of a global movement that aims to stop harassment in public places.
“It is a heavily under-reported crime: TfL research suggests around 90 to 95 per cent of cases doesn't get reported,” says Inspector Ricky Twyford, who manages Project Guardian. “Our main aim is to give victims and witnesses the confidence to come and talk to us about it... The more reports we have, the better equipped we'll be to deal with it.”
A MAJOR cause of under-reporting is a perception that these crimes are trivial or inevitable and that the police have more important matters to address. “People have misgivings about reporting these things — they see them as minor,” says Bryony Beynon, who co-founded Hollaback London with Julia Gray in 2010. “But people who commit such crimes may go on to do something more serious. It's a gateway crime to a higher level. Leering may become groping, which might become public masturbation or assault.”
And such crimes can have long-lasting effects on victims. Last month, a woman told the Evening Standard that a sexual assault had left her too emotionally scarred to travel on the Tube. She was attacked at London Bridge station last October by a father-of-two, Cao Cooc, and said: “I don't know what would have happened if the police had not been there and grabbed this man.”
Twyford is adamant that the police treat these crimes seriously: “We're trying to debunk myths. There's a belief that victims won't be believed, that it won't be taken seriously, that we can't catch these people. It's never going to be a positive experience but we are trying to make the interaction with the police as reassuring and comforting as possible.”
Far from it being impossible to bring prosecutions, the police have powerful weapons in their anti-groping arsenal. Around 2,000 police officers and PCSOs patrolling the capital's transport network have been specially trained to deal with cases of sexual harassment. Plain-clothes police sometimes catch people in the act. Officers are also trained in “behavioural assessment screening” so that they can recognise the way sexual offenders tend to act before they commit an offence. “Our pursuit is relentless,” says Twyford.
Both the Tube network and buses are well-covered by CCTV, a major tool for investigations. Images can then be circulated among the police and public. Oyster data can also be used: if users are registered to cards, the police know where they tapped in and out, and can send officers to those stations to pick them up there.
Sometimes, there is also DNA evidence. And — to serve as a warning to others — when individuals are convicted, the BTP publicises it, putting the sanction (such as the perpetrator going on the sex offenders list) into the public domain.
EVAW says it tends to be the same perpetrators again and again. The charity also notes that teenage girls and younger women are more heavily targeted, perhaps because they may appear less confident and the perpetrator may calculate that they are less likely to call them out. But men can also be victims. One recalls being groped aged 14 on a crammed tube train: “A man started stroking my penis through my trousers. All I could do was use my nearest hand to hold his hand away forcibly — I didn't want to cause an incident in such a narrow environment.”
The low reporting rate also reflects the fact that some victims are too upset to report the crimes and would prefer not to relive it. Many of those who contacted me — both women and men — said they were too shocked, embarrassed or even ashamed either to draw attention to it at the time, or to go to the police.
Sometimes, though, victims are also unsure whether a crime has been committed. The law here is actually fairly straight-forward: as soon as a person makes contact with someone in a sexual manner without consent — which can include pressing up against someone — that is sexual assault. Exposing genitals or masturbating in public can bring charges of “outraging public decency”, and aggressive sexual comments can be an offence under public disorder laws.
Additionally, the railway has very specific bylaws, some of which can be used against lower level criminal behaviour.
Next year, TfL will also launch a poster campaign to try to combat sexual harassment on the transport network, although critics note that this would have been better timed if it had started with the BTP's campaign. “These things need to be even higher up the priority list,” adds Beynon. “Awareness work on trains and buses will really help, though.”
Beynon is pleased, though, that victims increasingly feel able to fight back: “People say ‘just walk away' but that contributes to a culture of silence. It won't be right for everyone but speaking up to perpetrators can be really empowering — you can counter expectations that you'll stay quiet and take back some control of the situation.”
HOW TO HANDLE THE GROPERS
There is no single, correct way to respond to harassment. But police advice is to try to extricate yourself from the situation, ask for help from other passengers and call the British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or text them on 61016 in confidence. You can also contact Rape Crisis.
Gropers are trying to humiliate you into staying silent. If you feel able, make other passengers aware: calmly relay exactly what is happening and identify the groper.
If you have a bag, use it to put some distance between yourself and the groper. It communicates to them that you won't tolerate what's happening. If you're able to, consider taking a photo of the perpetrator.
If you're above ground, make a call and refuse to engage. Many perpetrators are excited by the distress they're causing by isolating you: making a call makes you less alone and simulates apathy for what is taking place in front of you.
One friend handles sexual comments by staring down the Neanderthals and asking them to repeat some crasser comments “so the rest of the ladies in the carriage can hear what a catch you are”.
If you're being followed, go above ground immediately. Find a member of the British Transport Police or go into a shop and tell a member of staff.
For inspiration, some Twitter followers of the Everyday Sexism blog have come up with snappy replies for less threatening situations:
“On train home guy rubs my bum. I grab hand, lift it in the air & say ‘Has anyone lost a hand? I found this one on my arse!'” (@punk_manners)
“Flashed at on a bus when I was 19. Snorted and said I'd seen more meat on a butcher's apron. Flasher got off bus, head low.” (@Rachel_Malone)
“When I get harassed I always pretend I didn't hear & say ‘What?' The more they have to repeat, the sillier they sound.” (@KariAnnSpriggs)
PHOEBE LUCKHURST
Ambra Prescott was raised in an evangelical Christian household. But even as a child, she said, she questioned what her family believed. "I almost got kicked out of Sunday school multiple times for asking things like, on Noah's ark, 'Where did all the poop go?' because they taught me a literalistic interpretation," she said.
Ambra Prescott was raised in an evangelical Christian household. But even as a child, she said, she questioned what her family believed.
"I almost got kicked out of Sunday school multiple times for asking things like, on Noah's ark, 'Where did all the poop go?' because they taught me a literalistic interpretation," she said.
Prescott, 20, said she spent her high-school years exploring other religions before settling on atheism in college. She now leads the Secular Society at Bowling Green State University.
She and others from her group are attending the Secular Student Alliance's annual conference this weekend at Ohio State University.
The conference is mostly leadership training for secular groups from colleges around the country but also has sessions for attendees to talk about secular ideas and beliefs and for college administrators seeking to make their campuses more accepting.
About 230 people are expected at the conference, the largest gathering of secular students in the country, said Lyz Liddell, director of campus organizing for the alliance.
Shared religious beliefs bring people together, and the alliance offers a way for secular people to come together as well, Liddell said.
"It's very important for secular students who don't participate in that religious subculture to have a safe place," she said.
Prescott, an intern with the alliance, said telling her family that she had turned to atheism was difficult and she turned to counseling for help with her mental and emotional struggles.
"There aren't very many of us," she said. "Sometimes when you're a part of a minority group, especially an invisible identity like this, it can feel very isolating."
Meeting with others who have similar views helps to eliminate that isolation, she said.
While her views align more with humanism, which believes that mankind can be good without God, she identifies as an atheist in an effort to take away the stigma associated with atheism, she said.
"People shouldn't instantly dislike or be afraid of somebody just for that," she said,
According to a study by the Pew Research Center, 45 percent of Americans believe that it's necessary to believe in God to be moral and 49 percent said they'd be unhappy if an atheist married into their family.
"People have this idea that if you don't believe in God, you're a bad person," Liddell said. "We're just like everybody else - we're good people, we're trying to make the world a little better."
A different Pew study that compared religious affiliations among American adults from 2007 to 2014 showed that 3.1 percent identify as atheists, an increase of 1.5 percent, and 4 percent identify as agnostic, an increase of 1.6 percent.
Young people 18 to 29 make up a significant portion of each group - 40 percent of atheists and 39 percent of agnostics.
In addition to representing atheist and agnostic views, this year's conference includes other diverse viewpoints, Liddell said. One speaker will be Lucien Greaves, a co-founder and spokesman for the Satanic Temple, which has chapters across the country.
Greave advocates for the separation of church and state and recently was in the news as part of the fight for the Baphomet, a statue that depicts the devil as a goat, to sit beside the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Oklahoma state capitol.
Greaves, whose real name is Doug Mesner, said that if one religion is represented, all viewpoints should be represented.
When the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in June that the Ten Commandments must come down, Greaves dropped out of the Baphomet push.
Greave presents Satanism as a nontheistic religion, he said in an interview. In his eyes, it's not the worship of Satan but using Satan as a symbol for rebelling against authority and as a defender of personal sovereignty.
The temple has seven tenets for its members to follow, including acting with compassion and empathy toward everyone.
"We feel that you can separate religion from superstition," Greaves said.
Most Satanists and other secularists believe and fight for social justice, including LGBT rights, Liddell said. Two national LGBT advocates, Marsha Botzer and Greta Christina, will speak and receive awards at the conference.
For many secular people, being true to who they are and telling their families about their views is similar to an LGBT person coming out of the closet, said Nick Stancato, the conference director.
Prescott's father, who isn't very religious, has been accepting of her views, but her mother has struggled, she said.
"When you say you don't agree with somebody or that you believe something else ... they feel rejected because you reject their beliefs even though you're not rejecting them," Prescott said.

For a lot of Android users around the globe lies the dilemma: older flagship or brand new mid-budget. If you ask us, we are cheering on the side of the older flagship devices.
For example, Samsung Galaxy S6. Amazing device, great design, sleek but occasionally erratic TouchWiz, stunning camera. What more you would expect from an Android smartphone? Well, lack of the timely and functioning software updates may come in question, but only because that's a general problem with Samsung and not an individual handset issue.
So, recently, users of S6 received the Nougat via OTA update. And then the hell broke loose. Many of them reported a lot of issues and today we provided a list of most common issues and possible workarounds for each individual reported the problem. If you have a hard time with your S6 after an update, make sure to check the list below.
Call issues
We had to start with the essential feature that some users reported as broken. Well, imagine that you own an amazing feature-rich device but, there's a little negligible problem: you can't answer your calls. That happened to some users. The phone is ringing but nothing is shown on the screen. This is how one user explained the problem:
”Since the Android update yesterday I go through periods where I cannot answer incoming calls. The phone rings but there is no indicator that there is an incoming call and icons or anything to even answer the incoming call. How do I correct this? I can restart my phone and I can answer incoming calls for a brief period then it starts all over again where I can't answer them. I have changed nothing on my phone. The only thing that has happened was the Android upgrade”
There's an alternative, but the only permanent solution is a factory reset. At least, if you want to answer to your calls like you used to before the Nougat update. For an alternative solution, you can navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Answering and end calls > and enable “Answer calls by pressing the home key”.
However, you can perform a factory reset and have a good chance of resolving this issue. This is how to do it:
Backup your data and make sure that the phone's battery is at least on 30%. Tap Settings. Open Backup & restore. Tap Reset device. Tap Erase everything. Confirm selection.
Your device will restart and you should be able to answer calls just like before an update.
Wi-Fi issues
Even the fundamental connectivity was struck down for some users. Namely, some of them reported that they were unable to connect to both home or public networks after the update. One user offered a concise description of the problem at hand:
”Got the new Android upday today (I have an S6) and tonight I couldn't connect to a public Wi-Fi network. How do i fix this? I had no issues connecting before the update.”
These are some steps you should take in order to address the Wi-Fi issues:
Forget/reestablish network.
Update router firmware.
Reset Network Settings.
Restart the router.
Use 2.4 GHz band instead of 5 GHz.
Use Recovery mode to wipe cache data.
Reset phone to factory settings.
If the problem is still there, make sure to address the issue to your carrier support center.
Camera issues
It seems that some of the native camera features are gone with the latest update. Allegedly, after the update, some users lost filters that were available on the previous Android version. This is how one user described his/her concerns regarding the subject:
”I've only had my phone running for a day with the latest update, but the grayscale camera filter seems to be MIA and the low light resolution is sub par now. I always found the grayscale filter to give better photos in low light, so even though I can edit a color photo to make it grey…it's not at all the same. I don't see grayscale as an option for a filter to download, but has anyone else run into this and found a solution?”
As you would imagine, there isn't a practical workaround for this. However, you can use an alternative app before the next system update to utilize your camera's full potential with all the needed features.
Buttons/keys issues
Another key feature (no pun intended) is broken for some users. Namely, the Power and Home keys are unresponsive for some users periodically after the update rollout. This is how one S6 owner explained his problem and the way her/he resolved it:
”After the Nougat update my power button intermittently stopped working, i.e. unable to turn screen on or if it is on, turn it off. Holding it down does nothing. After charging it for a bit, the problem seemed to go away. It was over 60% charged when I noticed the problem. Similarly, the home button either did nothing or opened Google Assistant (did not hold the button, simply tapped it). I powered off and on. I cleared the cache. Yet the problem still persisted. For NOW, it seems to have returned to working normally. Only thing I did was let it charge for about 30 minutes during a car ride. There is something unstable in the code.'‘
As you can see, this issue is somehow resolved by charging. On the other hand, if this strange occurrence is still there after a while, you should perform the factory reset.
Battery issues
Battery drains aren't exactly a novelty for Samsung updates. After the S7 and S7 Edge battery issues, the battery life is substantially decreased on S6, as well. One user shared a thorough explanation behind this issue:
”I've had my Samsung Galaxy S6 for around 16 months now. It seems like over the past 3-4 months the battery life has gotten worse, I've experienced a weird problem a few times too. Today, I was surprised look at my phone and see that the battery life was much lower than it should have been, since I had not been using my phone, it had just been in my pocket. Looking at the battery life chart in settings confirmed that there was a sudden drop in battery life a couple hours ago.”
As you can see for yourself, sudden drops of battery percentage are not uncommon after the update. However, you can perform a few tweaks to improve your battery life and those can be found in this article.
Wireless charging issues
Wireless charging is also impacted by the update. Some users reported that they're unable to charge their devices with wireless chargers as soon as the system updated. One user summarized the problem this way:
”Is anyone else having a problem with wireless charging after Nougat update? I keep my wireless charger on my desk at work. I did my update and then left. Came in the next day and the wireless isnt charging. Its not the charger because someone with an S7 and S8 have both tested it and they can charge on it. Any one else having this problem ?”
If you're certain that the wireless charger is functional, you can wipe the cache partition and, if that's not of any use, restore the factory settings.
Reboot/boot loop issues
Now, this is a dealbreaker for most of the users. Once they've installed the Nougat update, their respective devices get stuck on the welcome screen or the random resets started. One user presented the problem he has to cope with after the update:
”Hi, I tried to update my firmware with the new Nougat upgrade last night. When I retrieved my phone this morning, it was frozen on the Verizon screen. I tried all of the tricks: rebooting the system, rebooting to bootloader, wiping the cache partition, and even doing a hard factory reset. Nothing has worked – not even the factory reset! It still freezes on the Verizon screen. Any advice for a self fix before I take it to a repair shop? Thanks!”
It seems that there's no solution at the moment, at least not the one that can be performed by users themselves. So, if you've experienced similar issues, make sure to take your device to a service center.
Voicemail issues
This issue is not as much connected to a voicemail as it is an interface bug that causes the message playback to stop after the phone is close to your ear. It seems that the sensor bug affects the voicemail playback. Here is the description of the problem provided by one user:
”I have visual voicemail and anytime I hit play and then put the phone to my ear to listen to the message pauses. The only way for me to listen to the voicemail is to put it on speaker phone. Anybody knows a fix to this?”
Until now, the 3 workarounds proven as the best-suited for the job.
Navigate to Settings > Apps > Voicemail app > Force stop, and restart your device.
Disable all lock screen security measures (pattern, PIN, password).
Perform a factory reset.
But, for most of the users, the problem is still there. So, we should expect some fixes in the upcoming app and system versions.
Summary
At the end, it's important to say that some of these may be the isolated cases and the Nougat update work's as intended on your Samsung handset. However, there's also a possibility that we missed some of the issues, so you're welcome to share them in the comments section.
Either way, we certainly hope that the Samsung and the carriers will work their way out of this in the next update that's at the moment in the beta stage.
iOS 8 changes location tracking permissions from “Yes/No” to “Always/While Using The App/Never”, meaning that technically Facebook has to change the location permission for people who've turned on Nearby Friends. To pre-empt and thwart any freak outs, it published a blog post today explaining it's not tracking users any more than it already did, and not at all if they didn't opt in to enabling location tracking.
After years of sketchy privacy changes, this is Facebook's predicament. Everyone assumes its trying to harvest their personal data like the Matrix turned humans into batteries, which it typically is, but over the last year at least it's tried to be more up front about it.
Its iOS 8 app won't come out for a few more weeks, and will support the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sizes as well as iOS sharing sheets with friend tagging and emotion/activity sharing. But it's going out of its way now to tell users that the way its app and location tracking works isn't changing at all.
Facebook says “Nothing has changed about how Facebook gets location information from devices, but Apple has updated its Location Services setting…Facebook isn't getting any new location information when you upgrade to iOS 8…You control your location information. Nothing is changing and Facebook will continue to respect the choices you've made about location.”
As for its other apps, Facebook says “For apps from Facebook that don't have features that rely on getting location in the background, the Location Services setting for the iOS 8 versions will start at “While Using the App.” These apps include Messenger and Instagram.”
Facebook launched Nearby Friends, an opt-in always-on real-time proximity sharing feature, back in April to help people see if any of their friends were close enough for a spontaneous meetup. To preserve privacy, it doesn't actually show people's location, just how far away they are, and it doesn't get more specific than “1/2 mile”. Friends do have the option to share their exact location with a special someone for a few hours or indefinitely.
Nearby Friends has to be able to track your location even when the app is closed to work. So when iOS 8 changed the location tracking permission structure, Facebook had to switch people from “Yes” to “Always”. These mean the same thing, but people are still liable to panic. If it had switched people to “While Using The App” it would have broken Nearby Friends for anyone using it, and people wouldn't get an easily accessible option to switch to “Always”.
Facebook deliberately made Nearby Friends opt-in rather than opt-out to minimize privacy issues. It did the same for audio ID of songs and TV during status updates. And it recently started pushing all users through a privacy checkup. While its history with privacy has plenty to complain about, at least it's trying hard going forward.
There were some outstanding performances from B1G players in Week 6, but a few players went above and beyond the call of duty on Saturday.
With so many players putting up big numbers, narrowing down the top performers in each area had to be difficult for the conference this week. But when the dust settled, everyone can probably agree on who deserved the honors.
Here are the Week 6 Players of the Week in the B1G:
After rushing for 249 yards and two touchdowns on just 25 carries against Nebraska, Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor was tabbed as the B1G's Offensive and Freshman Player of the Week. It's not often that one player brings in two honors in the same week, but Taylor was sensational in Lincoln last weekend.
The #B1GFootball Offensive Player and Freshman of the Week is @BadgerFootball RB Jonathan Taylor. https://t.co/8LvzkBlNqr pic.twitter.com/PaVTftXTa5 — Big Ten Football (@B1Gfootball) October 9, 2017
Michigan State's Joe Bachie was tabbed as the Defensive Player of the Week after making 10 stops, one sack and recording an interception in Ann Arbor this weekend. His contributions helped the Spartans notch another big win over Michigan.
Maryland got thumped by Ohio State this weekend, but Ty Johnson was a diamond in the rough for the Terrapins on Saturday. He returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown and was named the B1G's Special Teams Player of the Week.
California has its Sunrise Powerlink transmission line, designed to bring cleaner power from various renewable energy projects in the Imperial Valley to San Diego residents. Nevada, too has its own such large scale transmission line project, called the One Nevada (ON) Transmission Line, which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) this week decided to help fund it in the form of a $343 million loan guarantee.
The online project, which broke ground back in October, consists of a new 500 kilovolt (kV) AC transmission line that will carry approximately 600 megawatts of electricity, including from renewable energy resources, in northern Nevada. It will run 235 miles from Ely, Nevada to just north of Las Vegas, and is described as they will run 235 miles from Ely, Nevada to just north of Las Vegas and is described by the DOE as the first phase of the Southwest Intertie Project (SWIP) which, when fully completed, will carry approximately 2,000 megawatts of electricity and enable wind and solar resources in Wyoming, Idaho and Nevada to power the southwest and California markets.
This particular power transmission line is the first of its kind funded in part by the DOE, which usually puts Recovery Act dollars towards large scale clean energy projects, particularly solar power. It is said the online project will contract about 85 percent of its parts and labor from U.S. companies and will create approximately 400 construction jobs. How many green jobs will be available after the project is built out were not mentioned.
The online is jointly owned by Great Basin Transmission South, LLC and NV Energy. It is projected it will be operational by the end of 2012.
We have received an incredible letter from Tanya Vittorio, a representative of Cordant, which claims that we're not in dispute and threatens striking members. Our General Secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, has replied at length to refute the claims that Ms Vittorio makes, and to affirm that our strike ballot is lawful and will continue:
Tanya Vittorio wrote on Friday 10 March 2017:
Dear Sirs,
With regards to the above matter. I have now taken instructions from our operations team and they in turn have discussed matters with the University of London (UOL).
Whilst we have seen the email from the UOL to the IWGB in 2011 we do not consider this to give rise to any contractual entitlement. The UOL were not in a position to create legal relations with your members (our employees).
As we have given no undertaking to ensure that pay differentials are maintained no legal entitlement arises.
In addition we do not accept your assertion that some of our workers are on zero hours contracts. The workers you are referring to are on annual hours contracts and therefore you have no valid complaint here either.
Finally, the pay slips provided to our workers comply with the statutory requirements. We are required to do no more.
On that basis we are not prepared to negotiate with you in respect of these issues and we are fully prepared to embrace any strike action you wish to pursue. As a Trade Union you are not recognised and have no bargaining, negotiation or consultations rights.
I am sure that you recognise your members will not be paid by us for the days they engage in any strike action. As we are not prepared to accept your demands or negotiate with you, then your strike action will be of no use to your members.
At this moment we do not consider that a trade dispute has arisen and therefore any strike action by your members will be unlawful and they will not attract statutory immunity. The correspondence you sent to our operations team in January 2016, does not have your members support. There is simply no evidence of this.
The attached list of signatures is nothing more than that (a list). There is no reference in that list to those signatures being in support of the letter sent. Therefore, we do not accept that the definition of a trade dispute has been met.
In addition the Trade Union will not be entitled to rely on statutory immunity either. Therefore, any strike action in the absence of a trade dispute will result in legal action against your member and the Union. We would also be entitled to dismiss any employee that strikes unlawfully.
We also note that your notice to ballot referred to the 1992 Act. We assume that you are aware of the recently implemented Trade Union Act 2016 and the balloting requirements contained within it.
It is unfortunate that this matter can not be resolved. However, the business intend to take a firm stance on this matter.
I will inform ACAS that conciliation is no longer an option.
Kind regards
Tanya Vittorio | Group Employee Relations Consultant, Cordant Group
and Jason Moyer-Lee's reply of Monday 13 March 2017:
Dear Ms. Vittorio,
Thank you for your email which I have read with with a mixture of amusement and absolute bewilderment. I would love to keep this reply short and snappy, however as you have managed to cram so much absurdity into your 13 paragraphs, I do fear I will struggle to be pithy in my response.
I am glad to see in your letter that your operation team has “discussed matters with the University of London (UOL)”. This clarifies for me, lest I had any doubt, that the various unlawful threats you go on to make about suing the union and dismissing workers is on behalf of and with the consent of the University of London.
As you know, the pay dispute over which we are currently balloting security guards arises because in 2011 the University of London made a promise to maintain their differentials with other outsourced workers as part of the London Living Wage implementation. The University has of course failed to do this and security guards as a result have seen smaller and smaller pay rises each year as compared to other outsourced workers. The beauty of outsourcing from the perspective of the unethical employer is that it allows a presumably reputable institution like the University of London to contract an incompetent middle-man company like yours to effectively manage relations with UoL workers on the University's behalf. Despite the fact that the University paid for the London Living Wage uplift, negotiated the implementation, and the dispute regards UoL security guards, you appear to be saying that the UoL's promise is worthless because UoL is not technically the employer. Whilst that may be the case legally, morally it is absurd.
You then go on to dispute that any of your workers are on 0-hours contracts, by implication drawing an important distinction between a 0-hours contract and a less-than-one-hour-per-day contract where all of the other hours routinely worked are on a 0-hours basis. Indeed this is precisely the sort of contract you appear to be giving security guards (see attached by way of example). To be clear, if a security guard has a guarantee of 336 hours in an entire year, to be allocated entirely at your discretion, yet they routinely work more hours than this, for all intents and purposes it is a 0 hours contract. The person has no stability, will struggle to get a mortgage, and is unable to financially plan with any degree of certainty. The fact that you somehow claim this is different because he is guaranteed on average less than one hour per day is preposterous. Also, the attached letter indicates you are not offering all security guards their entitlement to the enhanced holiday and sick pay to which they are legally entitled. I expect that to be rectified immediately, not least because this issue has already been raised before. As convenient as you may find it to have someone consistently check your work, we have a union to run and cannot spend all of our time trying to correct Cordant's pervasive incompetence.
Thank you for reminding me that the workers will not be paid for their strike action- very helpful. And thanks as well for the heads-up that in your opinion the strike will serve no purpose. I'm afraid I'm going to have to beg to differ. You see after a few days of the University being entirely shut down because there are no security guards or receptionists, and the halls of residence unable to function for the same reason, something tells me UoL will send its lackeys (that's you guys) to negotiate.
Incredibly, you assert in your letter that you do not consider there to be a trade dispute and as such you may take legal action against the IWGB or the workers and you may dismiss the workers. Here you appear to be dreadfully confused. The definition of a trade dispute, according to s218 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 is:
“…a dispute between employers and workers, or between workers and workers, which is connected with one or more of the following matters-” Included in the list of following matters is “terms and conditions of employment”. And further down in the section it states: “A dispute to which a trade union or employer's association is a party shall be treated for the purposes of this Part as a dispute to which workers or, as the case may be, employers are parties.” In other words, if we are in dispute with you, then the workers we represent are in dispute. Maybe take a minute to just pause and digest that.
You then go on to point out that the Trade Union Act 2016 has come into force and imply that we were unaware of this as our letter referred to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That's because the effect of the Trade Union Act 2016 was to amend the existing legislation. As such the relevant law is the 1992 Act. So to answer your question, yes we are aware of the impact of the Trade Union Act 2016. It appears maybe you are not.
You close by stating that Cordant is going to “take a firm stance on this matter.”
In trying to analyse the incredible amount of absolute nonsense contained in your email, I am able to come up with two theories. Either 1) despite being the in-house legal person you are so incredibly unaware of the relevant laws that the analogy of a doctor not knowing what paracetamol is comes to mind; or 2) you are aware of the relevant legislation and are purposely writing factually inaccurate emails in order to try and intimidate your workers out of strike action. If theory 1 is correct I'm afraid I don't have too much to say but I would recommend Cordant and the UoL have a little chat with you about the basics of employment law. If theory 2 is correct we will pursue you in an employment tribunal. My guess is your response to this email will probably tip the balance in favour of one of the two theories.
Regardless of what the explanation for your ridiculous email is, let me take this opportunity to make abundantly clear what our position is. Unless Cordant/UoL engage in meaningful negotiations and make a suitable offer on pay that our members accept, the ballot for industrial action will continue. And any strike will shut down the basic functioning of the University. If Cordant makes one more mention of the possibility of dismissing our members, or even issues so much as a verbal warning, we will pursue you to the full extent of the law. There is nothing we treat with more seriousness than the legal rights of our members and if you think you can act as though the law doesn't apply to you without consequence, I strongly suggest you think again.
Once again, thanks very much for your email.
Kind regards,
Dr. Jason Moyer-Lee, General Secretary, IWGB

So it's the day after Labor Day and its football season. After all the indulging you and I had yesterday I figured it was time for something somewhat healthy but still satisfying on game day! It's light…but heavy…and very satisfying…it's a Mexican Quinoa Jambalaya recipe!
It's a shrimp and chorizo jambalaya layered with Mexican spices and black beans but without the gut busting rice. Instead I use quinoa to give you the perfect balance between light and savory and you won't need a nap after you eat it.
So I'm sure by now you've realized that this recipe is not for my son. It's for you…all the guys and girls who are trying to stay healthy (kind of) during football season while still trying to enjoy the game with great friends, great family, and great food!
Ingredients
1/2 pound chorizo sausage
1/2 pound uncooked shrimp
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 15.5 oz. can black beans, rinsed
1/2 medium onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
Instructions
Preheat a sauté pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook chorizo until firm, turning frequently to avoid burning. Set aside to cool and then slice into bite sized pieces.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan add 1 cup rinsed quinoa, diced onions, diced peppers and all of the seasonings. Mix ingredients with 1 1/4 cups of water, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling lower heat to simmer quinoa for 15 minutes or until water is absorbed and quinoa is tender. During the last 3 minutes of cooking add uncooked shrimp and sliced chorizo sausage to saucepan and stir.
Once done let quinoa rest in saucepan, covered, for 5 minutes before serving.

“We Democrats cannot vote for that substitute and urge others to vote against it.”
That was Senate Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) explaining in no uncertain terms that the proposed continuing resolution by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is dead on arrival.
The unexpected turn of events came as negotiations broke down between McConnell and his counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).
I write “unexpected” because the legislation McConnell is touting as a compromise was apparently not even agreed to by Reid. It's a Republican bill — that funds Democrat priorities.
And, it strips out language that would have prevented the transition of U.S. oversight of the Internet's domain name system to foreign powers and multinational corporations at the end of the month, risking censorship by an unaccountable Internet global monopoly — with no First Amendment federal court remedy once out from under the U.S. government contract..
Meaning, McConnell is singularly responsible for everything in the legislation, including surrendering the Internet. He could have put whatever he wanted into the bill, including the language blocking the Internet giveaway. He opted not to.
Luckily, what he has on the floor now might not even pass. He has no idea what Reid will do when it goes to the floor Monday for a vote.
In other words, it's a amateur hour. McConnell ceded U.S. oversight over the Internet — in exchange for nothing. They got nothing.
Well almost nothing. You know what we're hearing? Republicans might have kept language out that would have allowed the Export Import Bank to meet and conduct business at a lower quorum requirement. And they kept out funding for Flint, Michigan's water crisis — which will probably pass next week anyway.
So they delayed inevitable meetings by the Ex-Im Bank to make loans pending another appointment to its board of directors in the next few months, and they slowed down passage of funding on Flint by a few days.
We ask you: Was that worth surrendering U.S. oversight of the free and open Internet we all use and depend on?
You know what we're also hearing? That Senate leaders are blaming Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for elevating the issue and using their platforms to communicate to their supporters about it. Oh, the horror.
As negotiations broke down, Reid told reporters Sept. 22 that Trump's support made the rider a non-starter: “It's obvious to me that Trump, [who] wants the federal government out of everything, suddenly now wants the government in something. It's his issue now, I don't think it's going to sell well in my caucus.”
So, Reid bluffed and told McConnell that Democrats would shut down the government if Republicans tried to block the surrender of the Internet to the international community — because Donald Trump said something about it.
And McConnell believed him, stripped the language out all by himself — without consulting with Reid — and put it on the Senate floor.
Can you believe this?
The Internet had to be given away because blocking the surrender was simply too popular, garnering the support of the GOP standard bearer, Trump, and oh gee, that was just too much exposure.
Never mind the fact that Trump's statement actually helped to begin the process of reconciliation between Trump and Cruz after a bitter primary battle, helping to unify Republicans for the elections in November. A legislative victory by McConnell could have had Republicans nationwide saluting and feeling inspired to keep the Senate majority, to keep the Internet free and open.
Now? They're cursing the day we ever won the Senate majority and put McConnell in charge.
In a statement, Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning lamented McConnell's surrender: “It is truly ironic that an issue which unifies the GOP, can be tossed aside because the minority in the Senate threatens to shut down the government… [T]he ultimate conclusion is that the GOP wields far more power when the Democrats control the Senate and they are forced to unify around conservative principles for political campaign purposes. The current Majority in Name Only is hardly worth defending when the Democrats and the corporatists win every battle.”
Perhaps McConnell also blames grassroots Americans who have been phoning their representatives and writing letters on this issue for 2-and-a-half years to stop the Internet surrender.
Or the Wall Street Journal's L. Gordon Crovitz for writing too many columns about it.
Or Americans for Limited Government for filing too much Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests demanding the Commerce Department's legal analysis of the authority to perform the transfer. Or demanding via FOIA analysis of antitrust issues to do with creating the global Internet monopoly in ICANN — which the Commerce Department still has not found any responsive documents for, nor have they responded to Congressional demands for the analysis.
You see, really, it's our fault. For advocating the issue. We simply raised its profile too high. If only we all had kept quiet, Congress would have addressed this issue.
Oh wait, no they wouldn't have.
In reality, it's McConnell's fault. For unilaterally stripping out the language blocking the Internet transfer, without apparently checking with anyone. Language his entire conference and both major Republican presidential candidates supported, which would have protected the vital Internet freedoms of each and every American. Because he did not know how to fight and win this issue, and when he unilaterally surrendered, blamed those who were on the outside trying to help.
Fortunately, all is not lost. McConnell has scheduled a vote for Monday, but already he is losing supporters for his precious continuing resolution. Sens. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) have withdrawn support because it did not address the Export Import Bank's quorum issues.
Which about that. If what it takes to save the free and open Internet for another fiscal year and kick this into the next administration so a new president can have a look is to lower the quorum requirements for the Ex-Im Bank, you lower the quorum requirements for the Ex-Im Bank. That's not even a choice. Include funding for Flint, Michigan's water supply in a bill that already spends hundreds of billions of dollars when similar legislation might pass the House next week anyway? Whatever.
The thing is, those issues however important (or unimportant, depending on your perspective) could also be dealt with again next year. Whereas once U.S. oversight of the Internet is relinquished — creating an unaccountable global monopoly over the Internet's domain name system — we will never get it back. We hope we're wrong, but the risks are there.
And we'll know who to blame. Senate Republicans, who refused to fight and, in this case, compromise to get something done on behalf of the American people.
If House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has any sense he'll immediately write his own continuing resolution, defund the Internet surrender — for the entire year, not this 3-month nonsense, like anyone wants to do this all over again in December — and send it to the Senate for consideration.
Or, Ryan can join McConnell's failure and force his own conference to vote for an unpopular, ill-conceived continuing resolution that surrenders U.S. oversight of the Internet.
Because, make no mistake, a vote for the continuing resolution is a vote for surrendering the free and open Internet to foreign powers and multinational corporations. Whoever votes yes will share the blame. And the shame — when one day it goes against U.S. interests, and results in censorship, a global Internet tax and other evils.

Against the Odds: Battle of Wits
by SaffronOlive // Mar 17, 2016 Tweet
video Against the Odds
Hello everyone and welcome to episode twenty-seven of Against the Odds. This week is actually pretty special. For only the second time in the history of Against the Odds, our Legacy option came out on top of our poll. As a result, we are going to be playing Battle of Wits in Legacy. One thing I realized as I was working on the episode is that, while Battle of Wits itself is fairly straightforward (you just have to play four decks mashed into one), making content about Battle of Wits is quite challenging. I mean, how do you make a deck tech for a 240 card deck?
The other good news this week is we have some bonus content. Last week when I went to record Rough Drafts, I happened to open a Battle of Wits in 9th Edition draft. Against my better judgment, I decided to go all in on building a draft version of the Battle of Wits deck. In the end it didn't fit the flavor of Rough Drafts (apart from being rough), so I recorded another draft for the series. Well, as I was editing Against the Odds, I remember I still had the Battle of Wits draft footage, so I decided to edit it and include it as a bonus for this episode. If you need a reminder as to why drafting around Battle of Wits is a bad idea, make sure to look for the video at the end of the article.
We'll talk more about Battle of Wits in a minute. First let's get to the videos. A quick reminder. If you enjoy Against the Odds and other video content here on MTGGoldfish, make sure to subscribe to the MTGGoldfish Youtube Channel to keep up with the latest and greatest.
Against the Odds: Battle of Wits Intro
Against the Odds: Battle of Wits Games
The Deck
$ 0.00 $ 0.00
I'm not even going to try to go over the entire list. It's simply too big and contains too many cards, so instead I'll focus on a few of the highlights. First off we have Battle of Wits, which let's us win the game on our upkeep, which is good, but requires us to play a deck of 240 cards, which leads to a ton of variance. Two hundred and forty cards is exactly the size of four constructed decks, so cards that we play as four-ofs will show up about as frequently as a one-of in a normal deck. As a result, playing a Battle of Wits deck feels a lot like playing a Commander deck.
First, we want to play cards that help us find Battle of Wits because just hoping we draw one isn't realistic. Actually, odds are against us seeing a Battle of Wits in any given game without the help of tutors. Second, we need to have some backup plans for winning the game, since even with tutors we are by no means guaranteed to find a copy of Battle of Wits in our massive deck.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Enlightened Tutor, Intuition, and Academy Rector are our best ways of finding a copy of Battle of Wits, and since we get to play four of each, this brings the total number of Battle of Wits in our deck to 16. It's still not enough that the odds favor us drawing a copy, but much better than if we were just playing the four Battle of Wits. Enlightened Tutor is the most efficient tutor in our deck, but it comes with the downside that we need to plan two turns ahead (one to put the Battle of Wits on top of our library and one to cast it). Intuition is essentially the blue Demonic Tutor, except it can only search for four-ofs (or three-ofs). Academy Rector might be the most powerful tutor in the bunch because it puts the Battle of Wits directly on the battlefield, however for it to work we need to find a way to kill the Academy Rector, which can sometimes be challenging, especially since we are in Bant, a color combination without many good non-exile removal options.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Gifts Ungiven and Bring to Light can't find us Battle of Wits. With Gifts Ungiven our opponent will just choose to have Battle of Wits go to the graveyard. Bring to Light can't search for enchantments. However, these cards are very good at finding our other tutors which, in turn, can find Battle of Wits. As such, I count each copy of Gifts Ungiven and Bring to Light as half a copy of Battle of Wits, which brings the total number in our deck to 20.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Birthing Pod and Chord of Calling also count as half-copies of Battle of Wits, since we can use them to find Academy Rector to find a Battle of Wits or Eternal Witness to get a Battle of Wits back from the graveyard. Chord of Calling is really powerful, since it can find a Academy Rector after our opponent has declared attacks. Afterwards, we can use the Academy Rector to block, search up a Battle of Wits, and win in our next upkeep.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Apart from using Birthing Pod to value our opponent out of the game, we have a couple other Plan B's, the first of which is a Stoneforge Mystic / equipment package of Batterskull, Umezawa's Jitte, and one of each Sword.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Another way we can win the game is to use Birthing Pod and Chord of Calling to assemble the Spike Feeder and Archangel of Thune combo. When we have both creatures on the battlefield, we can remove a counter from Spike Feeder to gain two life, which triggers Archangel of Thune's "Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature on control" ability, which puts a counter back on Spike Feeder. The end result of this loop is that we not only gain infinite life, but our creatures have infinite power and toughness, which is almost always enough to win the game.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Finally, our deck benefits from playing a lot of cards that are unexpected in Legacy. One of the hallmarks of Legacy is efficient, cheap creatures and efficient, cheap answers, which means that some decks are ill prepared to deal with things like Wurmcoil Engine, Thragtusk, and Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite. Our deck is so big that I can barely remember everything in it, which means it is exceedingly unlikely our opponent will have any idea what's going on, so we definitely benefit from the element of surprise. Legacy players don't expect opponents to be blinking Thragtusks with Restoration Angels.
The Matchups
Trying to break down matchups with a Battle of Wits deck is really strange. How good or bad any matchup ends up being depends on what cards we happen to draw. If we happen to have an opening hand of Noble Hierarch into Kitchen Finks into Obstinate Baloth into Thragtusk I don't think Burn could ever beat us, but we are just as likely to have an opener that is Force of Will, Academy Rector, Lotus Cobra, and Qasali Pridemage, in which case it's almost impossible for us to win.
The one thing I know for sure is that Force of Will is really hard for our deck to beat and pretty much everyone in Legacy is playing it. Typically, combo decks can get around Force of Will by playing their own counterspells, and while we have some in our deck, the odds that we have a Spell Pierce, Force of Will, or literal Counterspell in our hand when we need one isn't all that great. There were several games where we were able to put our opponent to the test: if they had a Force of Will we lose; if they don't, we'd win. Our opponent had it every time, which isn't surprising because Legacy decks are prepared to answer things like Show and Tell or Goblin Charbelcher, and Battle of Wits is essentially the same game winning threat, just slower and with a huge deck building restriction.
The Odds
Overall we manage to win one out of five matches (20% match win percentage) and three out of our 12 games (25% game win percentage). I think these numbers are pretty representative. Sometimes we'd get draws that match up well against our opponent (or managed to take advantage of the element of surprise) and win. Other times we'd draw the wrong half of our deck and lose.
The problem with Battle of Wits is there really isn't a way to fix its inconsistency. There simply isn't a way to play a 240 card deck and have it function like a 60 card deck, and that's the challenge of Battle of Wits. While the deck leads to some fun, random, Commander-esque games, I wouldn't want to play it in a competitive environment. The inconsistency is too great.

Newswise — More than a million cancer survivors living in the United States are foregoing what they believe is necessary medical care due to the cost, and Hispanics and African-Americans are twice as likely to go without services, according to data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference on the Science of Health Care Disparities.
"These survivors are either going without, or significantly delaying, dental care, general medical care, mental health care or prescription drugs," said Kathryn Weaver, Ph.D., a cancer prevention fellow at the National Cancer Institute.
Although insurance status did play a role, foregoing care due to cost still persisted among the insured. "There are significant out-of-pocket expenses, even for those with insurance," said Weaver. Weaver and colleagues used data from the Center for Disease Control's National Health Interview Survey to identify 6,602 adult cancer survivors. Of these survivors, 64.3 percent were female, 4.8 percent were Hispanic, 6.4 percent were non-Hispanic black and 88.8 percent were non-Hispanic white. The survey is conducted annually and questions about 30,000 to 40,000 households. Overall, the prevalence of foregoing medical care due to cost was 7.8 percent for general medical care, 9.9 percent for prescription medication, 11.3 percent for dental care and 2.7 percent for mental health care.
Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics were 2.14-fold more likely to forego prescription medications due to cost concerns and African-Americans were 87 percent more likely to forego prescriptions. For dental care, Hispanics were 2.31-fold more likely to go without and African-Americans were 57 percent more likely.
These differences persisted after statistical adjustments for education, health insurance coverage and non-cancer medical comorbidities.
"Efforts to expand insurance coverage might go some way toward addressing these problems, but absent that, clinicians need to be more aware that their patients are not getting these services and work to try to connect them to charity or low-cost care," said Weaver.
The mission of the American Association for Cancer Research is to prevent and cure cancer. Founded in 1907, AACR is the world's oldest and largest professional organization dedicated to advancing cancer research. The membership includes more than 28,000 basic, translational and clinical researchers; health care professionals; and cancer survivors and advocates in the United States and 80 other countries. The AACR marshals the full spectrum of expertise from the cancer community to accelerate progress in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer through high-quality scientific and educational programs. It funds innovative, meritorious research grants. The AACR Annual Meeting attracts more than 17,000 participants who share the latest discoveries and developments in the field. Special conferences throughout the year present novel data across a wide variety of topics in cancer research, treatment and patient care. The AACR publishes five major peer-reviewed journals: Cancer Research; Clinical Cancer Research; Molecular Cancer Therapeutics; Molecular Cancer Research; and Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention. The AACR's most recent publication and its sixth major journal, Cancer Prevention Research, is dedicated exclusively to cancer prevention, from preclinical research to clinical trials. The AACR also publishes CR, a magazine for cancer survivors and their families, patient advocates, physicians and scientists. CR provides a forum for sharing essential, evidence-based information and perspectives on progress in cancer research, survivorship and advocacy.
One more thing to be clear: the fact 0.9.0 patchnotes appeared today (partially) is due to the fact that today, patch 0.9.0 appeared on supertest. According to regular schedule, that means that common test should come next Thursday. HOWEVER, this patch is anything but common and delays are inevitable. Storm posted that the test will come in 2-3 weeks.
- optimization of World of Tanks is being conducted continuously
- there is no need to rebalance arty in general apparently
- choosing your team setup for maps in team battles will come after 9.0
- current amount of arties in battles is 1-3 per team
- it's not yet sure, whether confrontation will be completely scrapped or just temporarily disabled – Storm states that in order to work, it needs its MM fixed and there are no resources to do that for now
- apparently, according to Storm, confrontation setups like 15 RhB vs 15 ISU are not caused by faulty MM, they are caused by the fact that there are too many vehicles of that kind in the queue
- roaming: “when it's done it's done”
- according to Storm, the “epic” part of 9.0 are the HD tanks and historical battles
- the exact wording of new team battle awards and how Steel Wall was changed will be disclosed when the common test comes, but basically, Steel Wall had HE shell hits removed from its counter
- Storm confirms that T7 speed was buffed
- for now, new tree, bush and grass render is “when it's done it's done”
- T7CC and Mk.VIc were not buffed earlier simply because the department didn't get to do it
- the way MM will work in historical battles is simple: each vehicle will have its special HB MM weight, both teams are to have the same weight and a hardcap on each team's MM weight sum
- fixed setups (SS: as in, 5xPanzer IV and 1x Tiger vs 5x T-34 and 1x IS) for historical battles were not implemented, because they caused queues
- characteristics of tanks in historical battles will not be changed compared to random battles, the only changes will be the limits on tanks in battles, the limits on their configuration and historical ammunition setup
- no matter what, historical battles will not be removed – there will be no imbalance between sides and if they prove to be unpopular, that's not reason enough for removing them
- the dynamic resolution means that the UI resolution will remain the same, while the texture and game resolution can get lower in order to increase FPS
- it's not known yet, when (if at all) E-10 will appear in WoT, it's not in plans right now
- Storm confirms that the T7CC and Vickers Mk.VIc changes leak is correct
- improved graphics video for 9.0 will be released when the graphics development is finished
- on the new models, rotating parts such as the ventilators will not be animated (SS: that's okay, in real life you wouldn't see that from outside anyway)
- destroyed tank model will be as it was until now (pre-rendered) and not changing with the way your tank was destroyed
- WT E-100 autoloader will not be animated
- T-62 will not get the automated shell ejector animation
- apparently, “small” tanks (lower tiers) will have improved income in historical battles, 50 percent credit bonus and 20 percent XP bonus
- there will be awards for historical battles as well
- 9.0 test will come in 2-3 weeks
- new HD models will have collision models changed as well (SS: one important thing to note is the fact that ALL reworked vehicles will have different collision models – in other words, even if you don't use HD textures, you will still use the new collision model)
- parts of tanks falling off will come when Havok is introduced, eg. not in 9.0
- “British Shermans” (SS: Firefly) will come this year
- the timetable for HD tank implementation for Wargaming is very strict and leaves very little space for other model changes
- graphic improvements (not mentioned in 9.0 patchnotes for now) include new shaders and switch from SSAO to HBAO (SS: whatever that is)
- SMAA anti-aliasing will not be implemented, because it concerns standard (old) render
- ammorack hitpoints will not be rebalanced (SS: in connection with the turrets flying off)
- developers didn't manage to finish the possibility of turning tanks upside down (on their roof) on time for 9.0
- other than T7CC and Mk.VIc, there will be no tank changes in 9.0
- developers already have statistics of how nerfing TD alpha influenced gameplay, but Storm stated he can't tell
- aim sigma wasn't changed recently (SS: not sure whether it means previously, or in 9.0)
- dynamic tank characteristics in garage were not forgotten
- various levels of detail of HD tanks will not consist of old textures (the current ones), but of new HD models, cut into lower resolution
- the “even spread throughout the team positions rule” (SS: as in, you spend on the bottom of the team the same time as on top) will be disabled for historical battles
- heatmaps posted by “an American server” (SS: not sure which sever posts these, wotlabs?) are invalid, according to Storm
- it's possible new historical turrets will appear when vehicles are reworked into HD
- for now, it will not be possible to have platoons in historical battles, later this option will be implemented
- new shaders will not cause FPS increase
The NCAA Selection Committee announced the postseason field of 64 on Monday, and it's now time to start breaking down the overall field and individual NCAA Regionals.
Our postseason coverage begins with an in-depth overview of the field.
Toughest regionals
1. Starkville: Despite putting together an impressive run at the SEC tournament, the NCAA certainly didn't do the Bulldogs any favors when it comes to their NCAA Regional draw. Mississippi State must face Central Arkansas, a team that should be a No. 3 seed, in the first game. It also should be noted UCA actually took two of three from the Bulldogs on the road earlier this season. Meanwhile, both South Alabama and Mercer have impressive offensive lineups with just enough pitching to make some noise.
2. Blacksburg: Oklahoma hasn't played a great brand of baseball for much of the season, but did play very well in last week's Big 12 tournament. That should be reason enough for concern if you're Virginia Tech and others. The Sooners, if they hit, are an elite type of team with starting pitchers Jonathan Gray and Dillon Overton leading the charge. That's only the tip of the iceberg in this NCAA Regional, as Coastal Carolina has the pitching and offense to make noise, and Connecticut is one of the nation's hottest teams after winning the Big East tournament.
3. Columbia: I'm not sure if this NCAA Regional is quite as tough as the others, but it's always challenging when you must face an arch-rival in the NCAA postseason. For the second-straight season, Clemson heads to South Carolina, and certainly will give the Gamecocks some stiff competition. Meanwhile, Liberty is a very solid club and has an elite reliever in Ashton Perritt, among other quality arms, while Saint Louis is a very tough No. 4 seed with some quality wins this spring.
4. Los Angeles: This will be a very challenging, but exciting NCAA Regional for all the teams involved. UCLA has a very solid weekend rotation, while San Diego State has the potential to be a scary No. 4 seed with pitchers such as Michael Cederoth, Philip Walby and others leading the charge. Meanwhile, we all know what hard-hitting third baseman Kris Bryant and San Diego are capable of, while Cal Poly is a very solid club with Joey Wagman and Matt Imhof, among others, leading the way. Anyone could come out of this NCAA Regional.
5. Manhattan: This is one of the more balanced NCAA Regionals out there with Kansas State, Wichita State, Arkansas and Bryant involved. The Wildcats have an impressive offensive lineup, WSU has the talent to beat anyone, Arkansas is the favorite with starting pitchers Ryne Stanek and Barrett Astin leading the charge, and Bryant is a scary club with ace pitcher Peter Kelich as the headliner. Host K-State will have a tough time escaping this NCAA Regional.
Easiest regionals
1. Chapel Hill: Never say never, but it would be a shocker if the Tar Heels didn't escape from this NCAA Regional. UNC will play Canisius in the opening game, and should get through Florida Atlantic despite the fact the Owls are one of the hottest teams in the country. Meanwhile, the Tar Heels also have a relatively easy draw as a No. 3 seed with Towson, which enters the postseason with an RPI of 90.
2. Charlottesville: The Cavaliers certainly wouldn't admit this, but it would be a huge surprise if they didn't advance to an NCAA Super Regional. The Cavaliers draw Army in the second game, and if they win, will either play UNC Wilmington or Elon in the second game. UNCW is a dangerous club with Mat Batts leading the way on the mound, while Elon is in the postseason after getting hot in the SoCon tournament.
3. Baton Rouge: We wouldn't call the Tigers' draw an absolute cakewalk, but it's certainly very favorable. The Tigers open postseason play against weak Jackson State before facing either Louisiana-Lafayette and Sam Houston State. ULL has a very solid offensive lineup, but likely will throw ace pitcher Austin Robichaux in the opening game, while SHSU could provide somewhat of a threat with a solid rotation including pitchers Cody Dickson, Tyler Eppler and Caleb Smith.
4. Bloomington: Critics of the Big Ten will say Indiana is overrated, but we disagree. The Hoosiers are a very solid club and could very well end up in the College World Series. The Hoosiers have a solid draw in the first game in Valparaiso, who got hot in the Horizon League tournament, while Austin Peay is sizzling but. The big question with Austin Peay is how will it compete in the postseason environment after successfully doing it in the past, while for Florida, it'll be interesting to see which team shows up. The Gators have a lot of upsides, but haven't always clicked on all cylinders.
5. Eugene: The Ducks are very solid at home, and get a favorable set of teams at P.K Park this weekend. Rice is playing a solid brand of baseball, winning last week's Conference USA tournament, but still doesn't possess an offensive lineup that will overwhelm you. However, do keep an eye on the Rice pitching staff, which has a trio of solid starting pitchers, and a stud reliever in Zech Lemond. Meanwhile, San Francisco is a solid club, but isn't expected to pose a significant threat to the host Ducks.
Four seeds to watch
1. Central Arkansas: Considering the Bears hit the road earlier this season and took two of three from Mississippi State on the road, it's safe to say this is a team to watch in this weekend's Starkville Regional, especially that opening round rematch with the Bulldogs. UCA has a pair of solid starting pitchers in Caleb McClanahan and Bryce Biggerstaff, while Forrestt Allday is a spark plug atop the offensive lineup.
2. San Diego State: The Aztecs got over a huge hump over the weekend by winning the Mountain West tournament over New Mexico. Well, they might just be a team to watch this weekend in the Los Angeles Regional. SDSU has a trio of solid starting pitchers in Ryan Doran, Philip Walby and Michael Cederoth, while at the plate, Tyler France (.313/5/35) had a huge showing at the MWC tournament.
3. Connecticut: Though the Huskies didn't do particularly well in Big East play, they're playing a solid brand of baseball entering the NCAA tournament. UCONN has one of the nation's elite players to watch in second baseman LJ Mazzilli, who's hitting .364 with six homers and 49 RBIs, while starting pitcher Carson Cross can beat anyone, entering the postseason with a 2.50 ERA in 104 1/3 innings.
4. Wichita State: The Shockers used a strong run in the Missouri Valley tournament to make the NCAA postseason. Despite being a No. 4 seed, as usual, this is a very quality club entering the Manhattan Regional. Wichita State has a very good ace pitcher in Cale Elam that will give K-State fits in the opening game. Elam has a 2.60 ERA in 93 1/3 innings, along with 74 strikeouts and 29 walks.
5. Saint Louis: This isn't your typical weak No. 4 seed. The Billikens are an experienced and solid club, and they've been incredibly consistent this spring. Saint Louis has a pair of solid weekends starting pitchers in Alex Alemann and Clay Smith, while Alex Kelly is worth watching at the plate, hitting an impressive .340 with 11 homers and 60 RBIs.
Best potential super regional matchups
1. South Carolina vs. North Carolina: There's already not much love lost between the Gamecocks and Tar Heels over that whole "Carolina" debate. Throw in former UNC assistant Chad Holbrook returning to Chapel Hill, N.C., as an opposing head coach, and this is a very intriguing potential NCAA Super Regional.
2. Vanderbilt vs. Louisville: Though the Cardinals didn't get a national seed, they're elite and likely would've been in the mix if not for a poor showing in the Bg East tournament. The two teams are very familiar with each other, and each possesses an elite pitching staff.
3. Cal State Fullerton vs. UCLA: This potential NCAA Super Regional might not grab the attention of some on the national stage, but this would be an outstanding series. Fullerton certainly is the better team at this point in the season with more balance, but both teams possess impressive pitching staffs with Thomas Eshelman and Justin Garza for the Titans and Adam Plutko and Nick Vander Tuig for the Bruins.
4. Virginia vs. Mississippi State: The Cavaliers have been incredibly consistent this spring and a series against the Bulldogs would be outstanding. The Cavaliers are more offense oriented this season, while the Bulldogs tend to rely on their deep pitching staff to get the job done, though, the offense isn't bad. This would be a fantastic three-game series.
5. Florida State vs. Indiana: FSU head coach Mike Martin has done one his best coaching jobs this season, and a matchup against Indiana would be a dandy. The Hoosiers have one of the nation's elite offensive lineups with Sam Travis, Kyle Schwarber and Dustin DeMuth leading the charge, while FSU is very balanced.
Hottest teams to watch
1. Florida Atlantic: The Owls already were a safe bet to make the NCAA postseason before the Sun Belt tournament, but only helped their position with a strong run through the tourney, winning the Sun Belt tourney title. FAU is in the midst of an 11-game winning streak and hopes to give top-seeded UNC some growing pains this weekend.
2. Austin Peay State: Folks aren't talking about the Governors, but this is a very solid club that's in the midst of a 15-game winning streak. The Governors have plenty of players to watch, but keep close tabs on sluggers Craig Massoni and Jordan Hankins, who have 16 and 11 homers, respectively.
3. Cal State Fullerton: It's really difficult to be more consistent than the Titans have been this season. Eshelman and Garza have been fantastic on the mound, but two-way star Michael Lorenzen is having a strong campaign, while first baseman Carlos Lopez has a tendency to get big hits. Rick Vanderhook's club is playing at an extremely high level entering the postseason.
4. Virginia Tech: The Hokies earned plenty of recognition earlier this season for capturing huge series win over Virginia and Florida, among others. But they're finally coming together both offensively and on the mound, and that's a development that should scare some teams in this weekend's Blacksburg Regional.
5. Rice: Remember the perennial power Owls? The Owls haven't done enough to warrant a ton of headliners this spring, but they've played well the past couple of weeks, storming through the Conference USA tournament on the way to the C-USA automatic berth into the postseason. Rice has a solid weekend rotation with John Simms, Jordan Stephens and Austin Kubitza leading the way, while reliever Zech Lemond is a power arm that I absolutely love going into the postseason.
The Hotaru compact shower can reuse the same five gallons of water for two weeks
Sustainability was a trend I picked up on this year as I met with several startups at SXSW 2016. One company that clearly falls into that category is Hotaru, which created a water-recycling portable shower.
The early-stage hardware startup, based in Tokyo, received an undisclosed amount of angel funding from Taizo Son. Their compact shower product works by using multiple water reservoirs to store and purify water. I spoke with CEO/co-founder Riki Kitagawa and co-founder Ryo Yamada; they claim their device can recover 95-98 percent of the water used in the shower.
In operation, it holds five gallons of water. According to the co-founders, a family of three can each take a daily five-minute shower using the same five gallons of water for up to two weeks.
The compact shower can be easily deployed in any area. It does require a power source, but Riki and Ryo told me that you can hook it up to a car for basic power to run it (unheated water). To power the water heater, a generator or AC hookup is needed.
Hotaru is focused on a concept they call “water freedom.” This freedom of being able to live anywhere — even in locations where plumbing or access to water treatment is not available — is achieved by personalizing water treatment.
Obviously, outdoor living, military or travel uses come to mind for this concept (more showers on airplanes anyone?). However, when I contemplate the sheer waters savings that could be achieved, even in a residential setting, from a system like this, it seems pretty powerful.
Making sure the water remains purified is obviously a concern, and they are taking that challenge very seriously. The shower is outfitted with various sensors and alerts to maintain that level of purification.
The team was hilariously enough demonstrating the product on the trade-floor show by taking showers (with clothes on of course).
We were not able to discuss planned pricing or market availability at the time of publication.
UPDATE: I heard back from Hotaru; they plan to have the product in market in 2017 for $3,000.

Pallotta: ‘I thought Totti would miss'
By Football Italia staff
Roma President James Pallotta admits he thought Francesco Totti would miss his last minute penalty against Sampdoria.
As it happened, club legend Totti converted his spot-kick and handed the Giallorossi a 3-2 victory over the Blucerchiati.
Speaking to media post-match at Stadio Olimpico, the American said the wet playing surface was the reason for his reservations over the game's decisive moment.
“Totti? I thought he would miss the penalty, I thought this because it was wet,” Pallotta told reporters. “I wouldn't have had any worry if it had been dry.”
The club owner also claimed that if his side replicate Sunday's second half showing on a regular basis, few teams would be able to live with them.
“If Roma play like they did in the second half neither Juve nor Napoli could stop us.
“Even against Porto we played very well in the first half.”
(Joshua Paladino, Liberty Headlines) A U.S. District court voted on Nov. 16 in favor of “censorship zones” meant to keep pro-life activists away from abortion clinics.
Plaintiffs plan to appeal the decision, arguing it violates freedom of speech and purposefully disadvantages the pro-life message.
Plaintiff Nikki Bruni sued the City of Pittsburgh in 2014 with the hope to overturn a city ordinance that prevents congregating, patrolling, picketing, or otherwise demonstrating within 15 feet of health care facilities.
The Pittsburgh City Council intended the ordinance to “avoid violent confrontations” and “regulate use of public sidewalks,” according to the case decision. Upon passage of the ordinance, the city council expressed its hope to balance free speech rights with abortion rights.
ALSO: Supreme Court to Hear Calif. Case About Pro-Life Clinic Coercion
“The exercise of a person's right to protest or counsel against certain medical procedures is a First Amendment activity that must be balanced against another person's right to obtain medical counseling and treatment in an unobstructed manner,” the city council wrote.
Bruni decided to sue Pittsburgh after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a 35-foot buffer zone for abortion facilities in Massachusetts.
The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case, McCullen v. Coakley, agreeing that the Massachusetts law — the “Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act” — violated the First Amendment by placing overly broad restrictions on free speech.
Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion concurring with the decision, added that the Massachusetts law discriminated against pro-life speech.
“It is clear on the face of the Massachusetts law that it discriminates based on viewpoint. Speech in favor of the clinic and its work by employees and agents is permitted; speech criticizing the clinic and its work is a crime,” Alito wrote.
District Judge Cathy Bissoon dissented from the precedent set by the Supreme Court.
She wrote in the decision of Bruni v. City of Pittsburgh that the ordinance “imposes only a minimal burden on Plaintiffs' speech.”
One of her stated reasons: 15 feet is less than 35 feet. Bissoon admitted, however, that distance alone did not settle her decision.
“Unlike in McCullen, there is undisputed evidence in this case that Plaintiffs are able to communicate their anti-abortion message using their preferred form of expression— i.e., sidewalk counseling,” Bissoon wrote.
ALSO: Federal Court Blocks Ill. Law Forcing Pregnancy Centers to Refer for Abortions
Massachusetts's 35-foot buffer zone, in many cases, pushed pro-life counselors to the other side of the street, effectively silencing their message.
In Pittsburgh, however, Bissoon argued that no such problem occurs, which Bruni admitted during testimony.
In her decision, Bissoon also considered that Pittsburgh had attempted less intrusive restrictions of free speech, such as stationing police continually at Planned Parenthood to discourage violence and enforcing anti-obstruction laws.
The district court decided in favor of Pittsburgh once before in 2016, but the plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.
The 3rd Circuit court sent the case back to the district court after concluding “the Ordinance imposes the same kind of burden on speech” as the Massachusetts law, which the Supreme Court decided against.
Bissoon clearly did not agree with the 3rd Circuit Court or the Supreme Court.
The Alliance Defending Freedom, which litigated McCullen v. Coakley, is also trying this case.
“Because the city cannot justify squelching the peaceful offers of help that the sidewalk counselors we represent offer to women, we are consulting with our clients regarding the possibility of appeal,” ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot said.
Theriot said the Pittsburgh ordinance favors the pro-abortion viewpoint over the pro-life one.
“The government can't stifle free speech simply because some pro-abortion politicians or activists demand it. The district court should have ruled in accordance with the appeals court, which correctly applied what the Supreme Court made clear three years ago—that free speech receives the highest protection on public sidewalks,” Theriot said.
The ordinance creates a buffer zone “around the facilities of abortionists, eye doctors, dentists, and any ‘therapeutic,' ‘healing,' or ‘health-building' treatment services,” according to an ADF press release.
Supporters of the ordinance have painted this as protecting the right to access all medical care. Free speech advocates believe the city council specifically intended to criminalize sidewalk counseling in front of abortion facilities.
ADF Senior Counsel Matt Bowman said the stated goal of Pittsburgh's buffer zone to “avoid violent confrontations” does not warrant restrictions on free speech.
“The city of Pittsburgh didn't put together any good reason at all why innocent people who want to engage in free speech on the sidewalk should be banned when the city could just directly police any actual problems that are occurring,” Bowman said, according to the Daily Signal.
The court said incidents of “violence, disruption, and obstruction” occurred outside a downtown Pittsburgh Planned Parenthood in the 1990's.
In the 2000's, “incidents became less frequent and severe,” but some “pushing” and “verbal harassment” still happened.
In a 6-month period in 2005, the Pittsburgh Police Department reported 22 responses to the downtown Planned Parenthood.
Pittsburgh maintains the city needed the ordinance to address the burden of constantly patrolling and responding to disturbances at the Planned Parenthood.
Bruni and the ADF maintain that restrictions on free speech were not the proper way to remedy the situation.

This is pretty simple, let's dive in!
Has someone already written this package?
It might be worth saving yourself some time and doing a couple of searches for the package you are looking for.
As of this writing there are ~86k packages in npm and there is a good chance someone has done something similar to what you are building.
Some good places to search are: http://npmjs.org, http://node-modules.com, and http://npmsearch.com. There is also npm search on the command-line which you may find useful.
Choose a name
Find a name that isn't taken and clearly describes what your package is doing. You'll probably not want to use your-first-node-package as below, but for example's sake that is what we will be using.
Choose a descriptive name!
$ npm view your-first-node-package npm ERR! 404 'your-first-node-package' is not in the npm registry. ...
Woohoo, that name is not taken, let's take it.
Project initialization
It's probably best if you create a GitHub repository before initializing your project. That way when we run npm init , it will already know what repository you're pulling from and your git remote will be properly setup to track origin/master.
If that was all mumbo-jumbo, then it might be wise to have the git cheatsheet on hand.
**Note**: you don't need to use git in order to use npm, but you'll find that many packages in the npm registry are hosted on GitHub. Understanding the basic git commands will come in handy, promise!
$ git clone git@github.com:user/your-first-node-package.git $ cd your-first-node-package
OK, now we are ready to initialize package.json which will let npm know what the name of your package is as well as what dependencies it uses
$ npm init This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file. It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sane defaults. See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields and exactly what they do. Use `npm install <pkg> --save` afterwards to install a package and save it as a dependency in the package.json file. Press ^C at any time to quit. name: (your-first-node-package) version: (0.0.0) description: My very first package entry point: (index.js) test command: git repository: (https://github.com/user/your-first-node-package.git) keywords: author: Elijah Insua <tmpvar@gmail.com> (http://tmpvar.com) license: (ISC) About to write to /Users/tmpvar/your-first-node-package/package.json: { "name": "your-first-node-package", "version": "0.0.0", "description": "My very first package", "main": "index.js", "scripts": { "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" }, "repository": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/user/your-first-node-package.git" }, "author": "Elijah Insua <tmpvar@gmail.com> (http://tmpvar.com)", "license": "MIT" } Is this ok? (yes)
npm init will ask you a couple of questions. Once you've finished filling them out you can take a peek at the package.json file it generated to see what it actually did.
**Note**: if you `npm config set init.author.name ` and `npm config set init.author.email ` with your details, `npm init` will be able to pre-fill them these values as shown above.
$ cat package.json
{ "name": "your-first-node-package", "version": "0.0.0", "description": "very first package", "main": "index.js", "scripts": { "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" }, "repository": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/user/your-first-node-package.git" }, "author": "Elijah Insua <tmpvar@gmail.com> (http://tmpvar.com)", "license": "MIT" }
You can also manually edit this file if you need to. A good reason to do this is if you decide that your name is not specific enough or if the name you chose has been taken by the time you are ready to publish. You might also want to add a "test" script later on or bump the "version" , although you can also use npm version for that!
package.json is a config for installing packages and resolving dependencies, but there are also packages that use it to configure other aspects of your package's lifecycle.
Code time
A word of advice: packages should do **one thing**. If you have a `lib` directory with a grab-bag of utilities and other stuff in there, you should probably break those out into their own packages. Packages should be easy to digest and focused on the task they were created to perform.
module.exports = function(width, height) { return width * height; };
Looking for more info on npm? Check out our complete guide: Read now: The Ultimate Guide to npm
What is that module.exports thing?
By splitting individual units of functionality out into their own packages you are being a good Node.js citizen by allowing those who come after you to pick and choose how they want to build applications. Not only that—smaller packages allow faster iteration, focused documentation, and generally better test coverage (it is easier to test small packages)! ### The Hello World package So let's create a new file (module) *index.js* and make it compute the area of a rectangle. Why? Because it's a really easy demo!While the filename here is *index.js*, you could name it whatever you want. If you change it you should update *package.json*'s `"main"` property to match.
When Node.js loads your module it's actually wrapping it in a function that looks sort of like:
function(__dirname, __filename, module, exports, require) { // ... }
Where __dirname and __filename are the current directory and filename of the module being loaded.
require() is a function that will synchronously load another package or module from the filesystem and return it. The package or module will be cached when first loaded, so subsequent calls to require() for that package or module in your Node.js application will not need to re-read the file.
module.exports provides a way for modules to expose functionality. Let's take a look at how this would work with our example.
**Note**: `exports` is actually the same object as `module.exports` and can be safely ignored.
Node.js REPL
If you run node in a terminal, you will enter an interactive JavaScript prompt called the Node.js REPL (Read Eval Print Loop). We'll be using this prompt to test our new package—it goes something like this:
$ node > var area = require('./index.js'); undefined > area(2,4) 8 > (^C again to quit) >
(Hint: press Ctrl+C twice to exit the REPL.)
Because we set module.exports to a function, it is the only thing exported. We can then call it directly!
Publish time
If you are a new user:
$ npm adduser <your username>
Follow the steps and you'll have an account that lets you publish to the npm registry!
Let's get this package out into the world!
OK, we've made a package! Let's publish it on the npm registry so anyone can use it.
$ git add package.json index.js $ git commit -m "prepare for 1.0.0" $ npm version 1.0.0 v1.0.0 $ git push && git push --tags $ npm publish
**Note**: the `npm vesion` command will also make a "v1.0.0" git commit and tag to match, hence the use of `--tags` when pushing it to the remote.
And that's it!
Summary
We were able to build a function that computes the area of a rectangle and published it in the npm registry so other people could use it in their projects.
This is a very basic workflow and after you do it a couple of times it becomes ingrained in your muscle memory!
Homework
The above chart presents the difference between the average winrate for the hero main and the average winrate for the tier, using the same heroes as found in the second chart. Note that we are comparing the hero main winrates with the general winrate for the tier. We know that specializing in meta heroes generally yields high winrates , and these heroes are no exception. In this case, these heroes generally observe winrates 2% to 10% higher than the tier average. The players that are maining meta heroes know those heroes in and out, and these winrates correlate well with that. Without a doubt, Junkrat is *the* hero this season when it comes to winrates, and Junkrat mains are averaging +6% higher winrates across all the tiers. His buffs in Patch 1.14 have really turned him into one of the highest impact heroes in the game . Note that the other popular hero mains average around +4% higher winrates than their tier averages. Mercy in particular has changed quite a bit with Patch 1.15 - whereas in Season 5 maining Mercy didn't provide a winrate advantage - that has clearly changed. Players that main Mercy are now seeing higher winrates that players that only occasionally play Mercy - which may point to the idea that her skill ceiling has been increased.
Ibrahim is a student in the last year of the Pharmacy school in Mansoura - Egypt.
He was Kidnapped and tortured by the Egyptian police because he was sentenced to death based on a old trial in which he was found non-guilty. This old trial was before the revolution of Jan 25th 2011
Later the case was opened again and a new trial was done in absence of Ibrahim and he was sentenced to death
We need to do pressure on the Egyptian government to release Ibrahim and he is trialed in front of a fair court.

France will send special forces to protect nuclear giant Areva's uranium mines in Niger, according to a media report, amid a heightened security threat following a French-led offensive to drive Islamist rebels out of neighbouring Mali.

France is to deploy special forces to protect uranium mines belonging to French nuclear energy giant Areva in Niger, according to a report in a news magazine this week.
According to weekly Le Point, French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has given the go-ahead for an elite team from France's armed forces to reinforce local security at the company's two sites in Niger, a former French colony.
The move comes amid a heightened security threat following a French-led offensive to drive Islamist separatists out of northern Mali, and the deadly hostage crisis at the In Amenas gas facility in Algeria, which militants said was in revenge for the French military intervention.
The decision to deploy troops, however, was taken earlier in January, after a botched operation to rescue a captured French intelligence agent Denis Allex in southern Somalia, according to Le Point. Allex had been held hostage by militants there since 2009.
It is the first time government troops will be sent overseas to protect a facility owned by a private French company, according to Le Point, although French marines are already deployed on cargo ships travelling through the pirate-infested waters of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Guinea.
Niger's uranium a strategic French asset
The special forces team will be sent to the Imouraren and Arlit sites operated by Areva, according to the report.
Seven workers, including five French nationals, were abducted in Arlit by militants linked to al Qaeda's North African Branch, in 2010. Three of those hostages were later released, but four French citizens are still being held.
Areva, which relies on mines in Niger to supply France's nuclear power stations with uranium, confirmed it was beefing up its security on Thursday.
“We are obliged to reinforce our security … in the light of the current situation [France's intervention in Mali],” Areva Chief Executive Officer Luc Oursel told BFM TV, although he refused to comment on the report that this would involve French special forces.
Officials in Niger, while acknowledging that the security threat was heightened, said that no agreement had been reached - for the moment - for special forces to be deployed.
Areva has been mining uranium in Niger for more than fifty years and the company is the country's single biggest investor.
According to a 2008 report by a French parliamentary committee, about 18 per cent of the raw material used to power France's 58 nuclear reactors came from Niger in 2008.
Washington (CNN) The White House is preparing a slate of sanctions it could bring against Chinese enterprises in response to cyberattacks against American businesses, a government official familiar with the process told CNN.
The move is a show of force on the issue just a few weeks ahead of a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing over China's increasingly assertive national security posture.
Preparing the sanctions is the latest in a series of steps the administration has taken to try to show that it takes cyberattacks on U.S. business seriously -- but following through with sanctions would take the issue to a new level.
The U.S. official, however, said the administration had not made a final decision on a timeline to impose the sanctions.
The Washington Post on Monday first reported that the United States was weighing such action.
The sanctions, if imposed, would go after Chinese entities that steal American business secrets, a practice U.S. companies have long complained of. But they would also come on the heels of a massive hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management that compromised more than 21 million sensitive government employee records and background checks. The United States has accused China of being behind the hack.
The sanctions authority that would be invoked -- via an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in April, which gives the administration the ability to sanction entities worldwide for engaging in cyberattacks against U.S. targets -- doesn't address traditional government espionage hacks like OPM, but that breach looms over the decision.
Experts said it's no coincidence that word of the preparations is coming out just a few weeks before Xi's state visit at the end of the month. The threat of sanctions, they indicated, is designed to give the United States some leverage going into those talks.
"The main point here is to send a message to the Chinese," said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"It lets them know that there's a cost to doing this, which is something they didn't have to think before," he explained. "It helps reframe the debate."
He continued, "It's not like Xi's going to come in and say, 'I'm sorry, you're right. It'll never happen again.' But it does tell the Chinese: 'You're not going to be able to try to pretend (cyberespionage) didn't happen.'"
Lewis said the administration began seriously talking about what it wanted to do on China early this summer, with some parts of the government, like the military, looking for more aggressive action. But sanctions have the appeal of being both flexible and tangible, Lewis said.

In the meantime, the volatile Chinese economy has proved to be an unexpected factor, with the threat of a Chinese economic crisis making Xi's visit even more important for China and adding pressure on the United States to tread carefully.
The April executive order allows the Treasury Department, in consultation with the Justice and State Departments, to go after the assets of any individuals or organizations that engage in or economically benefit from stealing trade secrets from American companies by hacking.
Though the United States has sanctioned individuals in China in the past for offenses including supporting terrorism, and has added sanctions to its existing penalties on North Korea for the country's cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, the United States. has never before sanctioned individuals for an act of cyberespionage. That has frustrated American companies, which complain the Chinese government has engaged in unbridled attacks on U.S. targets to steal any intellectual property it can get its hands on.
China has repeatedly denied involvement in cyberattacks on the United States, even as the United States has placed greater pressure on China to fess up.
"It is the consistent position of China to firmly combat all forms of cyberattacks," Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in June when asked about the OPM hack. "We hope that the U.S. side would discard suspicions, refrain from making groundless accusations and show more trust and conduct more cooperation in this area."
The White House has tried to send the message to China before that it won't tolerate such attacks. Obama raised the issue with Xi in a meeting in California in 2013, and his Cabinet has continued to convey that message in talks with China. The Justice Department also indicted five Chinese military officials in 2014 on accusations they hacked U.S. businesses to steal trade secrets, upping the ante on publicly calling out Beijing for engaging in cyberespionage.
But even the administration has not expressed high hopes of bringing those individuals to the United States to stand trial, and many hard-liners have questioned why the White House wasn't using the highly detailed indictments to go after the businesses in China that alleged benefited from the stolen intellectual property.

Now, sanctions would be the first time the United States imposes a tangible cost on China for the economic cyberattacks the administration has spoken against for years. And officials hope the message hits home even before the state visit of Xi, whether or not the sanctions are imposed before then.
Norma Krayem, a former Clinton administration Commerce and State Department official, predicted the sanctions would come after the state visit, but the leak of their preparation gives the United States leverage going into those talks.
"I think the administration is making it clear prior to that visit that this is an issue of great import, and that the U.S. will stand behind its assertions that China and other nations need to stand down on its actions in cyberspace," Krayem, a senior policy adviser at Holland & Knight, said. "The biggest issue for the U.S. is making it clear on the international stage that they will do what they have to protect U.S. businesses. On the global arena, you cannot tell your opposition to stand down and, when they don't, take no action."
Lewis agreed: "In some ways that's the shrewdest way to do it, because it gives you a little leverage in the summit in terms of what they can ask for from Xi, where you can get some mileage."
But another government official cautioned against placing bets on how much of a role the state visit would play in the timing of any sanctions.
"There's always a reason not to do it," the official said. "I don't think any particular one event is going to drive it."
The White House would not officially comment on the sanctions preparation.
One senior administration official did note, however, that the new executive order allowed "the use of economic sanctions against malicious cyberactors," and that "the administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to confront such actors."
The official emphasized, "We are assessing all of our options to respond to these threats in a manner and timeframe of our choosing."

Three young women are back with their families for the first time in almost a decade
Ariel Castro is shown in a booking photo by the Cleveland Department of Public Safety following his arrest Monday in connection with allegedly abducting three women for up to a decade and holding them captive in his Cleveland house. (Photo11: Cleveland Dept. of Public Safety) Story Highlights Evidence they were chained, police say

Police arrested three brothers in connection with the case
CLEVELAND — Three young women, reunited with their families for the first time in nearly a decade, were talking to investigators Tuesday about their life in captivity amid reports that the women were forced to endure years of sexual abuse and beatings inside a rundown house on Cleveland's west side.
Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight bolted to freedom Monday after Berry's screams alerted a neighbor who helped her break free.
Police have arrested three brothers, Ariel Castro, 52, the owner of the house and a former Cleveland school bus driver; Pedro Castro, 54; and Onil Castro, 50, in connection with the alleged abductions.
A law enforcement official told USA Today there is evidence that the victims were held in chains during at least part of their captivity.
The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly, did not elaborate on other conditions of their confinement or whether they were ever moved from the home.
Khalid Samad, a former assistant safety director for the city, said law enforcement officials told him that the women were beaten while pregnant, with unborn children not surviving, and that a dungeon of sorts with chains was in the home. Samad, who works with a crime prevention non-profit group, said he saw the women at the hospital Monday night.
CLOSE Israel Lugo, neighbor of Ariel Castro who is accused of kidnapping three women, says that he and his family called the police after seeing women chained naked in the backyard of Castro's home. VPC
As questions were raised about how the women could have been held undetected for so long in a dense residential neighborhood, Cleveland Police Sgt. Sammy Morris said Tuesday that local police had contact with Ariel Castro on at least two occasions during the time the women were missing. Both contacts were unrelated to reports about the missing women.
Morris said local investigators and federal agents continued to search the house Tuesday, a task that was expected to take a few days.
"This is not going to be a couple-hour operation,'' Morris said. "They are going through the place with a fine-toothed comb.''
He said investigators were only beginning to interview the victims Tuesday.
All three suspects were being held on suspicion of rape and kidnapping, but Morris said details of the abuse and how the victims were held were not yet known. Morris also said authorities were seeking to learn whether the women were held at the same home or moved to other locations during their captivity.
Cleveland police said in a statement Tuesday night that charges had not yet been filed, and that the three men were being held in the Central Prison Unit at Cleveland's police headquarters.

"Right now, we want to let them spend some time with their families and take this process very, very slowly and respectful for their families and the young girls' needs," Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba said.
But neighbors and police sources were hinting at a life of horror for the women at the hands of captors for almost 10 years.
Elsie Cintron, who lives three houses away, said her daughter once saw a naked woman crawling on her hands and knees in the backyard several years ago and called police. "But they didn't take it seriously," she said.
Another neighbor, Israel Lugo, said he heard pounding on some of the doors of Castro's house, which had plastic bags on the windows, in November 2011. Lugo said officers knocked on the front door, but no one answered. "They walked to the side of the house and then left," he said.
Neighbors also said they would sometimes see Ariel Castro walking a little girl to a neighborhood playground. And Cintron said she once saw a little girl looking out of the house's attic window.
Israel Lugo said he, his family and neighbors called police three times between 2011 and 2012 after seeing disturbing things at the home of Ariel Castro. Lugo lives two houses down from Castro and grew suspicious after neighbors reported seeing naked women on leashes crawling on all fours behind Castro's house.

Lugo said about two years ago his sister told him she heard a woman pounding on a window at Castro's home as if she needed help. When his sister looked up, she saw a woman and a baby standing in a window half covered with a wooden plank. His sister told him and Lugo called the police.
Later, Lugo's mother called the police because Ariel Castro would park his school bus in front of their home and bring bags full of McDonald's and drinks into his home. They wondered why he needed so much food. Police again responded but didn't enter the home.
A third call came from neighborhood women who lived in an apartment building. Those women told Lugo they called police because they saw three young girls crawling on all fours naked with dog leashes around their necks. Three men were controlling them in the backyard. The women told Lugo they waited two hours but police never responded to the calls.
"I thought something was wrong because I got bad vibes from him," Lugo, 39, a subcontractor, said. "I didn't want to accuse someone falsely."
This past Sunday, Lugo said he saw Ariel Castro at a nearby park with the girl who now officials think is Berry's daughter.
When Lugo asked Castro whose daughter she was, Castro said that she was his girlfriend's daughter.
Tomba, tight-lipped on what investigators have uncovered, did say that police believe that a 6-year-old girl also found in the house was Berry's daughter. He declined to say who the father was or where the child was born.
Ariel Castro bought the four-bedroom, one-bath Seymour Street house for $12,000 on April 29, 1992 from Edwin and Antonia Castro, Cuyahoga County Auditor's records show. The two-story house with a basement is valued at $36,100, tax records show. County records indicate Castro owes $2,501.01 in back taxes and last paid real estate taxes in 2010. The house had been flagged for foreclosure, but court records show no indication of action by the county.
Cleveland officials said Tuesday that they have no record of anyone calling about criminal activity at the house, but that they are still combing their records.
WKYC-TV, quoting unidentified police sources, reported Tuesday that the suspects allegedly forced the women to have sex, resulting in up to five pregnancies.
WKYC's Tom Meyer quoted one of the sources as saying the captors would beat the pregnant girls. Two sources are quoted as saying the babies did not survive.

Emily Castro, Ariel's daughter, is serving 25 years in prison for attempting to murder her infant daughter.
Court records indicate that Emily Castro moved to Fort Wayne, Ind., with her boyfriend Deangelo Gonzalez, where she gave birth to her daughter.
Emily Castro suffered from manic depression diagnosed when she was 13, the court record says. On April 4, 2007, a day after her boyfriend moved out, Castro, then 19, allegedly slashed the 11-month-old's throat four times, cut her own neck and wrists and then attempted to drown herself in a nearby creek.
In an appeal filed Nov. 5, 2008 in Indiana, her attorneys argued that Castro was not competent to stand trial and that she was not sane at the time of the crime.
At the home in Cleveland, investigators worked through the night gathering evidence and clues in the case. They noted the presence of "disturbed" dirt in the backyard. WKYC says its source did not indicate whether that was related to the alleged pregnancies.
ANOTHER STRANGE TURN: Son of accused had written about missing Cleveland teen
The three were free Monday after neighbor Charles Ramsey heard Berry's screams and helped her slip through a small opening in a door.
"Amanda is the real hero," Tomba said. "This is the one that got this rolling."
Police rushed to the scene within two minutes after Berry called 911 from the neighbor's home. Police then freed the other two women.
The women were hospitalized in fair condition, but released to their families on Tuesday morning.
Each had gone missing separately. Berry disappeared at age 16 on April 21, 2003, when she called her sister to say she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King.
DeJesus went missing at age 14 on her way home from school about a year later. They were found just a few miles from where they had disappeared.

Police said Knight, now 32, went missing in 2002. The Cleveland Plain Dealer quoted Michelle Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, as saying her daughter believed that Michelle was last seen several years ago in a van with an older man at a shopping plaza.
The end to years of trauma ended within moments after Ramsey heard Berry's cries for help.
"I heard screaming," he said. "I'm eating my McDonald's. I come outside. I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house."
Ramsey said the door was only wide enough for a hand to fit through, so they kicked out the bottom and made enough space for her to escape.
She quickly called 911. "I'm Amanda Berry. ... I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here. I'm free now."
She said she had been taken by someone and begged for police officers to arrive at the house on Cleveland's west side before he returned.

In an odd twist, Ariel "Anthony' Castro, the 31-year-old son of suspect Ariel Castro, wrote in Plain Press, a community newspaper on Cleveland's west side, in 2004 about how DeJesus' disappearance had changed the neighborhood.
"(I)t's difficult to go any length of time without seeing Gina's picture on telephone poles, in windows, or on cars along the busy streets," wrote Castro, who studied journalism at Bowling Green State University.
He even quoted DeJesus' mother, Nancy Ruiz, as saying people had started looking after each other's children. "It's a shame that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors," Castro quotes her as saying. "Bless their hearts, they've been great."
On Monday, Castro told WKYC: "This is beyond comprehension ... I'm truly stunned right now."

Okay for all you Reddit geniuses out there that swear up and down that Agenda 21 is a conspiracy on par with the Amero and the Sasquatch, well don't choke on your Cheetos or anything, but you are wrong.
Not just kind of wrong, oh-that's-cute-no-biggie, but really really wrong. So, for May's Memory Lanes PD is going to go into just a small smattering of some quotes from those that have had a hand in designing it.
Let's start first with Maurice Strong of Oil-For-Food fame. No, those pics weren't taken in Movember, that wispy soup strainer has been part of his signature style since the 1960's.
Anyways, as the opening speaker at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janerio, where Agenda 21 was unveiled in 1992 (the one with 18,000 protesting outside), Maurice Strong brought the crowd to their feet by saying, “It is clear that current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class involving high meat intake, consumption of large amounts of frozen and convenience foods, use of fossil fuels, ownership of motor vehicles and small electrical appliances, home and workplace air conditioning, and suburban housing are not sustainable.”
Yeah, those middle class bastards with their air conditioning and microwaves.
Well, clearly we got it wrong here at PD. Maurice Strong absolutely must be the biggest libertarian there ever was. Doesn't that little opener sound just like freedom, freedom, freedom?
BEIJING — China intends to project naval power in the open ocean in coming years, and not just defend the country's coastal waters, according to a strategy paper released on Tuesday.
The paper, the first policy document issued by the Chinese military in two years, comes at a time of growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. China's efforts to enforce its disputed claims to vast stretches of the sea by building up artificial islands and structures on reefs and outcroppings have drawn the Philippines and its ally the United States into a test of wills in the region.
The dispute between Beijing and Washington escalated last week when an American military surveillance plane flew near Fiery Cross Reef, a contested atoll in the Spratly Islands that has been the site of frenetic dredging work in recent months. Chinese forces repeatedly ordered the American plane to leave the area, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman later called the flight “irresponsible and dangerous.”
The Pentagon said earlier this month that it was weighing whether to send warships and aircraft into what it says are international waters, but China says are within its zone of control.

When scouring the design field, searching for stand-out artistic expression and fluid composition, one area that should always catch the eye, is poster design. Moreover, concert poster design, which has produced some truly revolutionary artists and works for generations now, should be paid particular attention to. Fluidity of design is especially key in poster layouts, as there is a finite space, and numerous points to capture and pass along within these confines.
When scouring the design field, searching for stand-out artistic expression and fluid composition, one area that should always catch the eye, is poster design. Moreover, concert poster design, which has produced some truly revolutionary artists and works for generations now, should be paid particular attention to. Fluidity of design is especially key in poster layouts, as there is a finite space, and numerous points to capture and pass along within these confines.
The designer must encapsulate not only the band's attitude and tone with the work, but also impart the feel of the album or tour that the poster is announcing. And speaking of announcements, the posters must seamlessly incorporate the typography that tells the reader the names, dates, and places of import. All the while maintaining the impact of the piece, and not overworking or overfilling the area and detracting from it's overall arrangement.

On 7th June 1536, three days after she had been proclaimed queen at Greenwich, there was a water pageant, or procession, on the Thames in honour of the new Queen, Henry VIII's third wife Jane Seymour.
Chronicler Charles Wriothesley records the event as follows:
“Also, the 7th daie of June, being Wednesdaie in Whitson weeke, the King and the Queene went from Grenewych to Yorke Place, at Westminster, by water, his lordes going in barges afore him, everie lord in his owne barge, and the Kinge and the Queene in a barge togeeter, followinge after the lordes' barges, with his guard following him in a great barge; and as he passed by the shipps in the Thames everie shippe shott gonns, and at RadclifFe the Emperoures Embassidour stoode in a tente with a banner of the Emperoures armes seett in the topp of his tente and divers banners about the same, he himself being in a rych gowne of purple satten, with divers gentlemen standinge about him with gownes and cottes of velvett; and when the Beach Kinges [the Master of Ceremonies?] barge came by him, he sent tow bottes of his servantes to rowe aboute the Kinges barge, one of them were his trumpetters, and another with shalmes and sagebottes, and so made a great reverence to the Kinge and Queene as they came by him, and then he lett shott a fortie great gonns, and as the Kinge came against the Tower of London their was shott above fower hundred peeces of ordinance, and all the tower walls towardes the waterside were sett with great streamers and banners; and so the Kinge passed throwe London Bridge, with his trumpetts blowinge before him, and shalmes, sagbuttes, and dromeslawes [drummers] playing also in barges going before him, which was a goodlie sight to beholde.”1

Free the Files Help Unlock Election Spending
The National Association of Broadcasters, an industry group representing television stations around the country, is asking a court to block the implementation of a new rule that will put political ad information online before it goes into effect next month.
The Federal Communications Commission announced last week that the rule will go into effect Aug. 2. It will require affiliates of the four major networks in the nation's top 50 markets to post on a new website data about who is buying political ads and how much they are paying, among other information. The data is expected to help shed light on dark money spending by outside groups as well as spending by campaigns. The information is already public but is only available on paper at stations.
In a motion filed Tuesday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the broadcasters' trade group said that if the new FCC rule goes into effect, broadcasters “will suffer irreparable harm … because the [rule] compels television stations to post the prices for specific advertisements to a public website immediately after the sales occur.” The motion also argues that the FCC has “engaged in arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking by disregarding the competitive harm that is likely to result.”
The broadcasters have been fighting the new rule for the better part of a year, first mounting an aggressive lobbying effort before the FCC vote in April, then suing in May after the rule was passed, and now making an emergency request for a stay.
As we've previously noted, the commission is not requiring the files to be uploaded in a single format, which will make searching and analyzing the information a challenge.
The FCC said last week that it would “soon schedule user testing and educational webinars … to ensure that the uploading of materials by broadcasters can be conducted smoothly and efficiently.”
Phillip Thomas grew up wanting to play for the Redskins. (Eugene Tanner/Associated Press)
The Washington Redskins were scheduled to host North Carolina State cornerback David Amerson and Fresno State safety Phillip Thomas for pre-draft visits, two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed.
Nevada safety Duke Williams, whose visit with the team previously had been reported, also was scheduled to arrive at Redskins Park Wednesday.
Amerson, a 6-foot-3, 195-pound junior projected to go in the second or third round of the draft, was expected to meet with members of the team's defensive staff as Washington continues to evaluate talent leading up to the draft, which will take place April 25-27.
The Redskins don't have a first-round pick because they traded it along with last year's first- and second-rounders and next year's first-round pick to the St. Louis Rams in exchange for the No. 2 overall pick, which they used on quarterback Robert Griffin III.
Washington needs to upgrade its secondary after ranking 30th in the league against the pass last season. Both cornerback and safety are positions of need for the Redskins.
Amerson recorded 177 tackles and 18 interceptions in three seasons at N.C. State. He had his best production as a sophomore, when he notched 13 interceptions along with 59 tackles. He has great size and ball instincts, but he has proven susceptible to the double move, and his aggression has gotten him into trouble at times.
Thomas is projected to go in the second- to fourth-round range.
The 6-1, 210-pounder recorded 178 tackles and 13 interceptions as well as six forced fumbles in three seasons at Fresno State. He missed the 2011 season with a dislocated and fractured left ankle, but returned to have a career year in 2012. He was a standout at the Senior Bowl in January and met with Redskins coaches at the NFL Scouting Combine in February.
Although he has had some struggles in man coverage, Thomas does a good job of reading the quarterback and flying to the ball. Draft analysts have described him as “an instinctive ballhawk.”

D.C. Sports Bog: Paintings of Robert Griffin III
Balance and naturalism. These are two disciplines that were executed masterfully in the design of the Oak Pass House by Walker Workshop. This residence in Beverly Hills spans 8,000 square feet over two levels, designed with a careful balance between grandeur and intimacy. It stands atop a hill overlooking the landscape of Los Angeles, having been carefully embedded into the trees and topography of its plot. This relationship with natural cues and the balance between size and intimacy have made the Oak Pass House one of the most remarkable homes of 2015.
“It was clear that the combination of trees and topography would favor the creation of something carefully stitched into the land.”
TheCoolist sat down for a virtual chat with Noah Walker, architect and founder of Walker Workshop. Walker founded his design/build firm in 2010, specializing in residential design from restorations to new concepts. We asked the architect about the significance of this home, the process of its design and the future for Walker Workshop.
TheCoolist: The Oak Pass House appears to be the largest solo project you've take on yet. What opportunities and challenges did the scale of the Oak Pass House present to you?
Noah Walker: Prior to Oak Pass I had completed one major remodel and was working on my first ground up house. My client at the Oak Pass house was terrifically hands-off when it came to the big picture design concepts and gave me a tremendous amount of trust and freedom. The project did benefit greatly, and his only request was to make the rooms more grand and the home larger. I come from humble origins so it was good to be pushed towards grandeur. Other than that I felt ready to take on this challenge on my own. It was an incredibly rich and inspiring site to build inspiration from.
TC: The Oak Pass House appears to be inseparable from its plot. How did the land inform your design, and could this home have existed elsewhere?
Walker: I spent a great deal of time on the property in the early stages of the design. It was clear that the combination of trees and topography would favor the creation of something carefully stitched into the land.
TC: The home goes much further than a typical upside-down approach. What is most remarkable about the interplay between the top public levels and the lower private spaces?
Walker: The home is very processional and tactical. It really should be walked through to be fully appreciated. It's interesting how the views and moments continue to unfold, even on the lower level. This is partly because its location on a ridge allow the lower level to have wonderful views on either side. It also breaks down the scale of the home nicely. At almost 8,000 s.f. it is fairly large but It's very difficult to see the home in its totality.
TC: The wooden accents in the interior are a much higher grade than a typical wood texture. I understand you work with woodworker Jake Gevorgian— what role do craftspeople like Jake play in the development of a home like the Oak Pass House?
Walker: Jake was a terrific find. We are very lucky to find him using a website called Thumbtack to gather more bids on casework. I think when you find that artisan that works with a tremendous amount of heart, it really shows through to the finished product. Very often we also hold design of certain elements of the home to much later in the design process than normal architect would. At the Oak Pass house, the garage door, the wine room, and the stairs were all designed during the construction phase of the work. This allows us to use the cues that we see in the house itself as the inspiration for the work, and since we are also the builder we can be pretty nimble when we do this and also sometimes carry out the work ourselves.
TC: Do you have a favorite room or perspective of the space that you'll remember the later in your career?
Walker: Putting the pool under the tree was one of my favorite moments. I wanted to use the pool to create a horizon line for the upper space as well as be a marker for the splitting of the spaces below the upper level.
TC: What's next for Walker Workshop?
Walker: We currently have four projects under construction and another four in design. We recently completed the design of our first commercial space, and hopefully we will start doing more commercial and institutional work. Next moth we will be relocating our office to a space where we can start to do our own in-house fabrication for projects. I hope this will allow give us even more freedom to improvise and innovate on our projects.
The Oak Pass House by Walker Workshop is new contemporary estate in Beverly Hills, California
It spans 8,000 square feet of living space, also featuring the Oak Pass Guest House we've covered previously
The Oak Pass House is currently for sale, available for $22M

So long, Grand China. Hello high-rise!
Preserve Properties LLC is now one step closer to bringing another new residential tower to Peachtree Road just south of Buckhead Village. The long-anticipated project got some momentum last week with the demolition of the former Grand China restaurant building, reports BuckheadView.
Proposed back in 2014, the tower will bring 125 to 140 two- and three-bedroom luxury apartments to the site. Averaging a staggering 1,700 square feet a pop, units in the building won't come cheap, with prices from $3,800 to $5,800 per month. Each floor will feature a maximum of nine units, with fewer on the top floor.
Designed by Reese Vanderbilt, the building has a classical leaning, but with modern lines and lots of glass. While there will be no street-level retail, the building will contain 314 resident parking spaces on the bottom five floors, with a courtyard, pool deck, social room, guest suite, and fitness center on the sixth floor.
And for those still craving Chinese food — have no fear.
The owners of Grand China have spent the last few months renovating an old house a block away from their old location in order to continue to serve the community. Plans call for the new location at 2905 Peachtree Road to be open by the end of the month.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House has approved a bill that would make it harder for individuals or groups to bring legal claims against companies in consumer disputes, employment discrimination cases and other areas.
Lawmakers approved the Republican-sponsored measure, 220-201, Thursday night. The bill heads to the Senate, where its prospects are less clear.
The legislation is the latest in a flurry of business-friendly moves by Congress and the Trump administration. Changes mandated in the bill could help reduce legal costs for businesses by putting up more hurdles to bringing class-action lawsuits in federal court.
Supporters say the bill is needed to curb abuses in class-action suits that often result in a huge payday for lawyers.
“The class-action litigation system has morphed into an expensive enterprise where lawyers are often the only winners, and American businesses and consumers are the losers,” said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the bill's primary author. “Trial lawyers often profit at the expense of deserving victims.”
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business interests, also supported the legislation.
Consumer groups and civil rights advocates said the bill penalizes those who have been mistreated by corporations.
“This devastating Republican attack on our federal and state civil courts will severely restrict the hallowed right of the American people to have their day in court when they are wrongfully injured or defrauded,” said veteran consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
The bill would ensure that “judges' and juries' hands are tied by absentee politicians in Washington, greased by corporate campaign contributions,” Nader said.
Nader and other critics point to a history of cases in which class-action suits enabled consumers to recoup losses and compelled companies to stop selling unsafe products. A recent example: a suit by Volkswagen owners in the U.S. who won about $11 billion in compensation from the German company in its emissions cheating scandal.
The bill would require individuals seeking to form a legal class to show that each of them suffered the same type and magnitude of personal injury or economic loss as the group's leader. Attorneys in winning class-action suits couldn't collect payment from companies until after the individuals in the class are paid.
Republican lawmakers have long cherished the idea of overhauling the legal system. They've looked to rein in trial lawyers — key campaign donors as a group to Democrats — whom they portray as greedy and abusing a system tilted toward them. Corporations and businesses, which tend to donate more heavily to Republican candidates, are championed by the GOP lawmakers as bearing excessive legal burdens and costs that raise prices for consumers.
“Today, Republicans are championing big corporations with legislation aimed at eroding class actions, an indispensable tool for citizens to hold powerful interests and big corporations accountable for their misdeeds,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement.

AN ONLINE video has captured the hilariously hopeless subtitles Facebook adds to an episode of Still Game.
The social media giant has introduced a feature which allows users to add automated captions to videos.
But when the technology is applied to Glaswegian accents it produces total gibberish.
BBC Scotland tested the subtitles on a clip from episode four of the sitcom's triumphant return, ‘Small Change'.
Legendary gossip Isa calls Jack “My baby” when she actually claims to be watching her weight and has her telling the waitress “Baby, baby white food” when she's asking for a fork.
The comedy captions then make her sound like Yoda, reading: “Oh should be congratulations not bad you that is” when she congratulates the waitress on her anniversary.
Other subtitles include "Had you know I just see the field get your city would it's bad yourself nice” for the line “I just saw wee Fergie across the road, he was buying you something nice.”

And when Isa asks for a “tattie scone” on the top of her fillings, the caption thinks she's said “Back to school to tap.”
The amusing clip closes with Isa asking for a “wee tomato” on her roll, which Facebook picks up as “Wee slice it to my 10”.
Isa asks for it “to go” to which the waitress fires back “Aye, we've got a wheelbarrow out the back.” Facebook appears to give up on her strong Glasweigan accent at this point, simply stating: “Back”.
Facebook users were quick to respond to the clueless captions.
Tim Swindler wrote: “So that's what Glasweigan sounds like to the untrained ear!”
Rebecca Muir commented: “Just watch how wrong these captions are. Lolzer.”
Amy Gray said: “My husband doesn't get how I can understand it.”

Whilst Glinda Anderson from America added: “This is so funny to listen to, as I need practice for my ears so if I'm lucky enough to visit Scotland I can order a proper meal.”
The final installment the current series of Still Game will air this Friday, when Jack and Victor are placed into a care home.
The iconic duo is also returning to the stage next year for another live show at the SSE Hydro following the success of their 2014 performance.

Pakistan have been in blistering form of late as they continued their getting ways into the ODI number, order, group, line after getting the better of England in the Test ring. Pakistan got the better of England in the first ODI by 6 wickets in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
With it, Pakistan have taken a 1-0 lead in the four-match ODI number, order, group, line and will be sharp to increase their lead to an unassailable 2-0 when they square off in the second ODI in Abu Dhabi on Friday.
Pakistan vs England 2nd ODI schedule of Next Match
England players need to come up with a better performance in the second ODI, especially their batsmen, who looked in all sorts of problems against the strong-looking Pakistan bowling attack. England were tottering at three down 14 runs, but skipper Eoin Morgan and James Taylor helped bring some stability in the middle order with a knock of 76 and 60 runs, respectively.
However, with England losing the key wickets of Morgan and Taylor, the visitors once again crumbled and were all out for 216 runs, failing to even play out the allotted 50 overs.
Pakistan, who were set an easy total to chase, did not start brightly, losing their first two wickets for 15 runs. Reece Topley bowled brilliantly as he finished the game with three scalps and was one of the major highlights for England. Pakistan were able to chase down the score with the help of Mohammad Hafeez's century.

The first ODI did show Pakistan as a stronger side, but there were some positives from the match for England, especially the batting performance of Morgan and Taylor. Topley was the standout bowler. These players will be required to come up with a similar performance in the second ODI in Abu Dhabi on Friday.
Other batsmen, primarily Alex Hales and Joe Root, need to be in top form at the top of the order. If they players get their act together and score runs, their middle-order batsmen, including Morgan, Taylor and Jos Buttler, can bank upon the start and help England put up a decent score.
Despite Pakistan's victory, skipper Azhar Ali, who scored 8 runs in the first ODI, needs to lead from the front and other batsmen such as Shoaib Mailk and Bilal Asif need to deliver with the willow in the second ODI. More……

The holograms we have seen for the past 50 years have at once fascinated and disappointed us. If we had been hoping to see something along the lines of the projected image of Princess Leia from Star Wars, or the holodeck from Star Trek Next Generation, disappointment would likely have overwhelmed our sense of fascination.
Two years ago researchers at the University of Arizona for the first time “demonstrated an optical material that can display "holographic video," as opposed to static holograms found in credit cards and product packages.” Since then it seemed our hopes for holograms have been getting brighter.
Now researchers at the University of Cambridge's Centre of Molecular Materials for Photonics and Electronics (CMMPE) have used carbon nanotubes to create 3D hologram images with an extremely wide field of view and the highest possible resolution.
The research, which was published in the journal Advanced Materials (“Carbon Nanotube Based High Resolution Holograms”), essentially used the carbon nanotubes as diffractive elements that turn the carbon nanotubes into optical projectors. The small size of the carbon nanotubes created smaller pixels thus boosting the resolution of the image.
“Smaller pixels allow the diffraction of light at larger angles – increasing the field of view. Essentially, the smaller the pixel, the higher the resolution of the hologram,” says Dr. Haider Butt from CMMPE in a press release.
The demonstration of their new carbon nanotube-based pixels involved spelling out the name “Cambridge” using various colors of laser light that had been scattered through the carbon nanotube pixels. While initially a fairly modest display and dependent on the prohibitively expensive carbon nanotubes, Butt believes that some kind of nanomaterials will form the basis of a new approach to holographic images.
Butt adds in the release: “A new class of highly sensitive holographic sensors can be developed that could sense distance, motion, tilt, temperature and density of biological materials. What's certain is that these results pave the way towards utilizing nanostructures to producing 3D holograms with wide field of view and the very highest resolution.”
To replace the carbon nanotubes, the researchers are looking at the prospect of using zinc oxide nanowires, which Zhong Lin Wang at Georgia Tech has been using over the years for its of piezoelectric qualities.
The other big issue that the researchers still we need to address is investigating “holographic video” because currently the carbon nanotube pixels can only project static holograms. Looks like there's still some work to be done before Princess Leia holograms are projected, at least with a nanomaterial as the pixel.

UPDATED STORY: April 20, 2017, 1:49 p.m. Hate crime charges dismissed against two women accused of setting Trump sign on fire, police say
Two Baltimore-area women were charged with lighting a Trump sign on fire in Somerset County, officials said.
Princess Anne police have charged D'Asia R. Perry, of Baltimore, and Joy M. Shuford, of Owings Mills, both 19, with multiple offenses, including second-degree arson and committing a hate crime, the Maryland State Fire Marshal's Office said.
"The intentional burning of these political signs, along with the beliefs, religious views and race of this political affiliation, directly coincides with the victim," a Princess Anne police officer wrote in charging documents to support the hate crime charge.
By committing arson, "in doing so, with discrimination or malice toward a particular group, or someone's belief," was the reasoning for charging the women with a hate crime offense as well, said Caryn L. McMahon, deputy chief fire marshal.
Daniel W. Powell, the State's Attorney for Somerset County, declined to comment on the case. Timothy R. Bozman, chief of the Princess Anne Police Department could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon.
Neither Perry nor Shuford have an attorney listed in online court records, nor could be reached for comment Tuesday.
The damaged sign is located in a shopping center on Carole Lane in Princess Anne, and is owned by Robert Wink, the fire marshal's office said.
Jamie Wink, Wink's son, who helps run the family store, Wink's Sporting Goods, said the sign has been outside the shop since September. It's been set on fire once before and stolen twice. But he said it's also attracted visitors who often stop to pose for selfies.

Wink said the family supports the Trump administration but said the sign has also been good for the store, which sells firearms and hunting supplies.
Since the election is over, Wink considered replacing the Trump sign with a sign advertising the shop. But because the Trump sign has gotten so much attention, he plans to keep it up.
"It's been a pretty good attention-getter," he said.
The blaze was started Friday morning, and spread to nearby vegetation but was extinguished by the fire department, the fire marshal's office said. The fire caused $800 in damage, the office said.
Wink said the Trump campaign sign wasn't either badly damaged. He said a sign for Kathy Szeliga, who ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate, was melted and damaged.
Perry was identified by police as the driver of the vehicle involved in the incident. She was located on the campus of University of Maryland Eastern Shore and taken into custody, the office said. Shuford turned herself into Princess Anne Police on Saturday.
Police identified the women after reviewing surveillance video in the area, according to charging documents. The surveillance video footage showed a silver Volkswagen Beetle with two females inside stop by the sign. A passenger is seen getting out of the car and using a lighter to ignite a Glock advertisement sign near the Trump sign. The passenger then gets back into the Beetle, which drives off, the document said.
Princess Anne officers searched the area for the vehicle and found it at the parking lot in a student apartment building at the UMES campus. Perry then was seen coming out of the building and walking on the sidewalk. An officer then recognized Perry as the driver of the vehicle, and questioned her.
Perry told the officer she "just gave her a ride," referring to Shuford. Perry said the other woman's name was "April," and then later told the officer that she didn't know the name of the woman.
Both women were released on a $20,000 unsecured bond.

Carlton and the Demons have reached agreement on a trade that will see Jeff Garlett depart the Blues.
Carlton has traded Garlett to Melbourne in exchange for its 4th round selection (currently pick 61).
In addition, Carlton and Melbourne will swap their 5th round selections, with Carlton moving up the order to pick 79 and Melbourne now having pick 83.
Garlett was recruited to Carlton in the 2008 rookie draft and made his debut in Round 1, 2009 against Richmond. He has played 107 AFL games.
Carlton's GM – Football Operations Andrew McKay has thanked Garlett for his contribution to the Blues.
“Jeff leaves us with our best wishes for the future,” McKay said.
“It was time for him to have a fresh start and we are pleased to have been able to facilitate that by reaching agreement on a trade with Melbourne.
“Securing the fourth round draft pick gives us some options in terms of the remaining trade window and the upcoming AFL draft. We will now look to use that selection to continue improving our list as we look with optimism to season 2015.”
Bulky, sluggish and unintuitive, Samsung's Galaxy Gear hasn't exactly lived up the hype or the expectations of a ‘smartwatch'.
The Galaxy Gear wasn't Samsung's first stab at a smartwatch. In 1999 and again in 2009, it had a go at chunky digital watches but neither took off with consumers. Samsung's grand vision for the Galaxy Gear was "a companion device that will keep us constantly connected," as Samsung‘s executive vice-president of marketing Lee Young-hee described it.
Whether it was through bad timing - a rush to beat Apple's much rumoured ‘iWatch' to the market - or through the limitation of current technology, including the lack of viable curved displays and battery technology restrictions, the Galaxy Gear was released as very much a limited product, with a confused and slow interface, a lack of device support, and very little in the way of ‘killer' functionality to justify its £299 price tag.
'Our Gear lacks something special'
Samsung has admitted that the Gear isn't up to scratch, as a Samsung official told the Korean Times, “We've acknowledged that our Gear lacks something special. With more investment for user interface and user experience, Samsung devices will be better in terms of customer satisfaction.”
This is despite Young-hee telling reporters that the Gear is "definitely receiving warm response," at a launch event for the smartwatch in southern Seoul yesterday. "The Galaxy Gear is a wow product. It's a wholly new and must-have accessory."reporters.
Not so much Dick Tracy...
The Galaxy Gear promises Dick Tracy-style phone calls and messaging from your wrist, and connects via Bluetooth only to Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 phablet, although support for others like the Galaxy S4 is being added at a later date according to Samsung.
As well as letting you make and receive calls via a microphone on its wrist strap and speakers embedded in the Gear's main body, it pulls messages, contacts and alerts from your phone, placing at-a-glance information on your wrist.
The Gear also has its own bespoke third-party apps like Evernote, Path, Pocket and RunKeeper, plus Samsung's own applications like the instant messaging service ChatON, its S Voice digital assistant, and a pedometer, which takes advantage of the built-in sensors including an accelerometer and gyroscope within the watch.
The Gear feels awfully sluggish
While promising much, on initial testing Samsung's Galaxy Gear hasn't lived up to the hype.
In my own hands-on experience at the launch event in Berlin on 4 September I found it to be sluggish during navigation, with an awkward swipe-based interface that, although simple compared to Samsung's Galaxy Android smartphones, was unintuitive and confusing at times.
The smartwatch was also bulky on the wrist and difficult to use as an actual timepiece, with the time display only visible when you shook your wrist, not at a glance when you are likely to want to see the time.
Other initial hands-on testers had similar experiences.
"The Gear feels awfully sluggish, whether you're launching an app such as Evernote or Path, or swiping down from the home screen to activate the camera. The interface also feels a bit clunky and unpolished at times," wrote Zach Honig for gadget site Engadget.
Likewise Vlad Savov writing for the Verge found there to be "a tangible lag to anything you do with the Gear, while the swipe gestures are hard to figure out and do different things depending on where you are in the menus".
Ian Fogg, director for mobile and telecoms at research company IHS, described the Gear as "a prototype masquerading as a commercial product - and because of that, it is unlikely to be successful in the market".
Fogg explained that "the device exhibits multiple shortcomings, including a high price tag, a short battery life, its status as a companion device and its limited compatibility. The bottom line is the Galaxy Gear smartwatch probably will not succeed in the market and Samsung will need to try again with a more refined product."
'A prototype to determine market reaction'
A report in Daum, which is based in Samsung's homeland of South Korea, suggests that the Galaxy Gear was indeed "just the first… to determine the market reaction", and that an upgraded version could be announced as soon as January at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas or Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona in March, complete with GPS and location-based services.
Despite a its high price tag of £299, Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, reckons that Samsung will sell one million units, "although compared to the expectation of 1bn in overall smartphone sales it's a drop in the ocean".
"Given the 125 million installation base of Samsung's Galaxy S3, S4 and Note series, plus the fact that Samsung's likely to bundle them with the purchase of new phones as it has done with tablets in the past, I can see them selling at least one million units," Wood told the Guardian.
"It is very much a 'version 0.1' product, however, but Samsung has a history of rapid evolution of products - I suspect the Galaxy Gear 2 is very close behind."
Samsung's Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Gear went on sale on 25 September priced at around £599 for the phablet and £299 for the smartwatch.

Last week two of our very own prinnies Jaspreet and Taku had the chance to sit down with Kodaka-san, the creator and scenario writer of the Danganronpa series. Our prinnies managed to interview Kodaka-san and talked all things Danganronpa. Read the part 1/3 of the interview below, doods!
Question 1
Jaspreet:
What character did you enjoy creating the most from the Danganronpa series?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
I really enjoy writing all of my characters, but the character design for Sakura Ogami had the greatest impact on me.
Jaspreet:
How come?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
I enjoy seeing all of the character designs, but it's particularly great when I see something that I wasn't imagining.
Jaspreet:
Okay, is that because she is so big and strong?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
Yes, that's right. (laughs)
Question 2
Jaspreet:
How do you balance what you want to write and what people want to see in the game?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
Actually, when I'm writing the scripts, I write the script for myself, I imagine myself as the user and I would write to see what I'd enjoy seeing in the story. 100% what I'd enjoy.
Jaspreet:
Okay that's good, as you keep it true to yourself, awesome!
Kazutaka Kodaka:
(laughs)
Question 3
Jaspreet:
Would you ever make a game where Monokuma is the main character / protagonist, and you play as Monokuma?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
I don't want any other players to control Monokuma, I want to be the one to control Monokuma.
*Everyone laughs*
Kazutaka Kodaka:
Monokuma is my creation.
Jaspreet:
It's also very interesting because having no control over him creates more fear for that character.
Kazutaka Kodaka:
Monokuma is actually a very complicated character, I basically created Monokuma based on my own feelings so people can't read when he will be nice or really evil, you don't know what he'll say next, he's very unpredictable.
Jaspreet:
So he's very volatile.
Kazutaka Kodaka:
When I create characters, I don't really go into detail about how they are going to talk or how they are going to act, so when the final creation comes out, I'm sometimes surprised by the outcome myself.
Jaspreet:
Oh I see, so you are surprised by the characters' own development?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
I'm surprised and like to make players surprised too.
Question 4
Jaspreet:
So Danganronpa V3's theme is known as “Psycho-Cool,” why did you choose to go this way? Was it a conscious decision, or was it something that developed over time?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
In the beginning I was thinking of giving Danganronpa V3 an American theme.
Jaspreet:
So not making the game based in Japan, but based in America?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
Well it was more like “Psycho-America.”
*Everyone says “Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww”, and he laughs*
Kazutaka Kodaka:
I was actually imagining that it would be based in a desert, but as I was running through it, I felt that this wasn't interesting at all, so I changed it by adding a bit of a science-fiction element and that turned out to be more of a “Psycho-Cool” theme.
Jaspreet:
Awesome, that really interesting!
Kazutaka Kodaka:
Danganronpa 2 was a “Psycho-Tropical” theme, right?
Jaspreet:
Yes!
Kazutaka Kodaka:
I thought that I'd be able to go to Hawaii to do research, but I didn't get to go.
*Everyone laughs*
So this time I thought I'd do “Psycho-America” and be able to go to Las Vegas, but again I wasn't able to go, so now I'm like, forget it!
*Everyone laughs*
Jaspreet:
So “Psycho-America” is still a theme you want to do?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
If I get to go to Las Vegas, yes.
Jaspreet:
One day maybe.
*Everyone laughs*
Question 5
Jaspreet:
If you could go back to any of the Danganronpa games (Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair or Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls) would you change anything? And why?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
No not really, what I did, I'm happy with.
Jaspreet:
So you're very happy with what you ended up with?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
All the things that I wanted to do or possibly change for Danganronpa 1 and 2, I was able to accomplish in Danganronpa V3. So Danganronpa 1 and 2 are good in their own way, and they don't need changes.
I wanted to make something completely different from 1 and 2, so that is what I did with Danganronpa V3, and in Danganronpa V3 I wanted to let the players feel personally moved in a way that only Danganronpa is capable of.
Question 6
Jaspreet:
So following up from that, would you go back to your younger self and give yourself advice on anything?
Kazutaka Kodaka:
When I was in my twenties I used to work in a game shop and I wasn't doing anything with my life, so I'd like to go back and tell myself “you suck.”
*Everyone laughs*
I'd also tell myself how bad of a person I was so that I'd be a better person.
Jaspreet:
To encourage himself.
*Everyone laughs*
But he's ended up here so he obviously did something right.
Kazutaka Kodaka:
When I was working at the game shop I used to collect a lot of retro games, and in the Danganronpa mini-games you can see the little 8-bit characters and some retro aspects to them, so I feel that it didn't go to complete waste. I must have actually used some of that knowledge. When I was 20, Japan was quite a peaceful country, so I was very laid-back and lazy.
*Everyone laughs*

In a survey featured in January's Monthly Labor Review published by the U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics, researchers found that in 2010
all female racial groups enjoyed higher (or in one case equal) and more uniform promotion rates than did their male counterparts.
As Job Promotion in Mid-Career notes, the improvement for women in 2010 occurred only toward the top of the socio-economic ladder. Only college-educated workers between '96 and '10 experienced a "steady narrowing of the gender gap." In historical perspective, the authors wrote,
some of the biggest promotion differences between the genders have been occupation specific. [A]lthough men in traditionally female jobs enjoyed higher promotion rates than did women in traditionally female jobs, gender promotion rates in this category were virtually identical in 2010. Further, while women enjoyed higher promotion rates in male-dominated and traditionally mixed jobs, this advantage was only significant in 2010.
In other words, by 2010, at least among college-educated women in both traditionally male and female jobs, promotion rates were either higher for women than men or identical for both genders. What the statistics do not show is whether the women promoted in 2010 had made up for their lack of promotions in earlier years. As the authors of the cited article state, men enjoyed higher promotion rates in traditionally female jobs in 1996 and 2006.
What this means for mid-career women: you deserve a raise
As the authors note, it is hardly surprising that promoted workers received higher wage increases than the non-promoted.
Female wage growth from promotion exceeded that of men at the start of the period [in 1996]; however, male and female wage growths were virtually identical at the end of the period [in 2010].
There is a wealth of data in the referenced article, including the differing reasons men and women gave as the reasons for their promotions. If you review the study, or simply read my analysis of its findings here, remember that we are talking primarily about college-educated women working for large firms.
Wage and Leadership Gaps Overall Unaffected
Also remember that promotion rates for all workers, male and female, fell precipitously between 1996 and 2010. Therefore, even though college-educated women and men reached promotion parity by 2010, there were twice the number of promotions overall during the time when men's exceeded women's. We do not know how these figures fit into the overall wage and leadership gaps which continue to range between 77 and 80% (wage) and more than 80% (leadership).
What are some of the most common low blood sugar symptoms? This will depend on the severity of the condition. As the normal blood sugar levels start to fall the symptoms seen will become more severe, and eventually death can occur if the blood sugar levels get too low to support life. Some of the very first symptoms which may appear are nausea, trembling, tachycardia, a sensation of extreme hunger, nervousness, tingling and numbness in the lips and fingertips, and excessive sweating for no reason.
When hypoglycemia becomes moderate the low blood sugar symptoms seen will become worse. As the level of blood sugar reaches 55 mg/dL or less than the condition will start to impact the nervous system of the body. Some common signs of moderate hypoglycemia include anxiety, weakness, headache, blurry vision, confusion, aggression, a lack of coordination, difficulty with movement and walking, and other signs. Hypoglycemia blood sugar levels are far below the normal range.
With low blood sugar symptoms that are severe it is considered a medical emergency, because death may occur if the individual is not treated by a physician immediately. Common signs of this stage include seizures, convulsions, extreme drowsiness or an inability to rouse the person, a lowered body temperature, a coma, and other complications. If treatment is not sought immediately for both low and high blood sugar symptoms then the end result could be brain damage or death.
Any low blood sugar symptoms should be evaluated and taken seriously. Once your blood sugar levels drop below a certain point rational though may not be possible. A low blood sugar diet can help keep this level stable, and prevent ups and downs which cause symptoms and can become dangerous. Keeping track of your own levels can help you determine what is normal for you, because everyone is unique and slightly different. Sometimes it is possible to develop these symptoms even if your readings are normal if your level drops suddenly for some reason.
A psychologist working for the German Red Cross has been stabbed to death by a Syrian man at a counseling centre for refugees in the western state of Saarland.
The charity said the attack took place on Wednesday in the state capital, Saarbruecken.
The 27-year-old Syrian attacked the Red Cross psychologist following an argument, German news agency dpa reported. The suspect, who wasn't identified, was arrested shortly after the attack.

The 30-year-old psychologist had been working for the Red Cross since 2014, helping people who had experienced trauma begin lives.
The shocking incident comes after an attack on Sunday that saw a five-year-old child stabbed to death by an Afghan national at a refugee shelter in southeastern Germany.
The 41-year-old assailant also injured the child's mother, a Russian national, and a six-year-old child at the scene was treated for shock and taken to hospital.
The attack was apparently sparked by a dispute between asylum seekers at the centre.
Germany has seen an influx of around 1 million refugees since 2015, with emigrants from war-torn Syria and Afghanistan leading the numbers.
And tensions have arisen between some refugees and some native Germans. According to the country's Interior Ministry, as reported in the Independent, there were an average 10 attacks every day on refugees in 2016.
Vigilant gangs have been formed by groups of far-right-wingers in a number of German towns, while there were reports of mass sexual assault by refugees on women at a New Year's Eve event in Cologne in 2015.
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said it would tap $2.2 billion from a Chinese credit line to boost oil output at joint ventures with China National Petroleum Corp, in a boost for the South American country's struggling oil industry and a show of unity with a key ally.

CNPC, China's largest state energy group, and Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] will seek to boost production in the OPEC country by around 277,000 barrels per day, President Nicolas Maduro said in a televised address.
Funds will come from a credit line of up to $9 billion with China, Maduro said after a meeting with CNPC in Caracas on Thursday.
The agreement will be a boon to Venezuela's oil industry, which has seen its production tumble this year amid a steep recession. It is also welcome public backing for Maduro from a strategic ally amid a political and economic crisis.
“Many thanks for all the support you have given Venezuela in 2014, 2015, and especially 2016,” Maduro said in a televised speech. “Our older sister China has not left Venezuela alone in moments of difficulty.”
Venezuela has borrowed over $50 billion from China under a financing arrangement created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez in 2007, in which a portion of its crude and fuel sales to the world's second-biggest economy are used to pay down loans.
The increased oil output at the joint ventures would boost shipments to China to over 800,000 bpd, the president said.
Venezuela is undergoing a brutal recession due to a collapsing state-led economy, made worse by the tumble in oil prices. The rout in oil markets has also left Maduro's government struggling to meet the original terms of the oil-for-loans agreement, which require that PDVSA set aside more barrels for debt services when prices fall.
CNPC has minority stakes in oil joint ventures with Caracas-based PDVSA, which oversees the world's biggest oil reserves but has seen output fall amid the country's cash crunch, low investment, and debts with service providers.
Output increases are planned at the Petrourica, Petrozumano, and Sinovensa joint ventures, Maduro said. A deal was also reached to rehabilitate 500 light crude wells with a potential of some 42,800 bpd.
Oil Minister and PDVSA president Eulogio Del Pino said the projects would be rolled out in coming months.
It was not immediately clear if China would free up more oil funds via the credit line.
Dear Friends in Christ: The following statement of resolve in the wake of yesterday's election comes to you from The Rt. Rev. Michael Hanley, Bishop of Oregon in consultation with the Very Rev. Nathan LeRud, Dean of Trinity Cathedral and several clergy leaders of the diocese.
There are moments in our history in which the Church is presented with an opportunity to affirm who we are, and who we endeavor to be. Too often, we have been passive in the face of injustice, bigotry, and oppression. We confess our complicity in political and religious systems that have perpetuated injustice over many generations. We confess that fear and the desire to keep the peace has often led us to issue statements rather than the harder task of working for a more just and equitable society.
As Christians we are called to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ with clarity and conviction, particularly as that Gospel compels us to work alongside those in every faith tradition to confront forces which threaten the lives and safety of the most vulnerable.
As a people committed to the incarnation of God in the human body of Jesus Christ and the mystical body of the gathered community, we affirm that our very bodies must serve the cause of healing, love and justice. We believe in the goodness and holiness of the human body in all of its varied and diverse forms, and we commit to the protection of bodies and souls in the face of forces that demean, disenfranchise, threaten and abuse the children of God. We renounce the evil powers of this world which corrupt and destroy the creatures of God. Therefore we commit:
To protect and defend the human dignity of immigrants, refugees, and those who fear deportation. Our churches will be sanctuaries for those whose safety and security is threatened;
To stand and work with those whose race or religion is threatened by the vitriolic and violent language and action of white supremacy in American society;
To confront bigotry, fear, ignorance and hatred whenever and wherever we encounter it. We will not be silent or passive in the face of language that harms the children of God;
To protect the physical, psychological, and spiritual safety of women, people of sexual and gender diversity, the elderly and the physically impaired;
To pray for our president and elected leaders and hold them accountable to the principles of justice as found in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
We believe that together we can foster a world of justice, love and the mercy of God. We commit to this work and we invite those who would do likewise to join us in the work ahead.
Genes responsible for hypoplastic left heart syndrome identified using mouse models.
Pittsburgh, PA (PRWEB) May 22, 2017
The first known identification of two genes responsible for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe congenital heart defect, has been reported by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The findings are published today in the journal Nature Genetics.
Congenital heart disease, or structural abnormalities in the heart that are present at birth, affect up to 1 percent of all live births. HLHS is a rare congenital heart disease where the left side of the heart is poorly developed, resulting in an inability to effectively pump blood to the rest of the body. It occurs in about 2 to 3 of every 10,000 live births in the United States, and is fatal if left untreated.
Current treatment for HLHS involves multiple complex surgeries in the first few years of a child's life, and while effective in many patients, it does not improve heart function in many others. In those individuals, heart failure ensues and heart transplantation is required. The five-year survival rate for HLHS patients is approximately 50 to 70 percent.
Though genetic risk factors are known to play a role in HLHS, specific genes have been hard to identify.
"Studying diseases with complex genetics is extremely challenging. Our study has been made possible by leveraging findings from a large-scale analysis in mice to recover mutations causing congenital heart defects. This resulted in the recovery of the first mouse models of HLHS. Analysis of these mice with HLHS allowed us to identify for the first time two genes interacting in combination to cause HLHS," said Cecilia Lo, Ph.D., professor at Pitt's School of Medicine who also holds the F. Sargent Cheever Chair in Developmental Biology. "By understanding the genetics and biology of HLHS, this can facilitate development of new therapies to improve the prognosis for these patients."
Lo and her team used fetal ultrasound imaging to screen mice with experimentally induced mutations, looking for structural heart defects. From this screen, they recovered eight different mouse strains with structural and functional heart defects indicative of HLHS.
By comparing the genome of mice with the HLHS heart defects to the genome of normal mice, Lo and her team identified several hundred mutations in the HLHS mutant strains. Further analysis of these mutant mice indicated the genetic origins of HLHS likely involve many interacting genes. The relevance of these mutations was reinforced by the fact that many also were found in the same chromosomal regions previously shown to be associated with HLHS from human genetic studies.
In one mouse strain, they discovered that mutations in two genes, named Sap130 and Pcdha9, were required for HLHS. "Interestingly, HLHS was found only in animals with mutations in both genes. However, animals that had mutations with Pcdha9, but not Sap130, can display defects in the aorta, but with normal-sized left ventricles, suggesting interaction between the two genes is needed to cause all the features of HLHS," said Xiaoqin Liu, M.D., Ph.D., the first author of the new study and a research instructor in Lo's lab.
Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in mice, the researchers confirmed that mutations in these two genes can cause HLHS. Additionally, they sequenced 68 HLHS patient samples and found one individual with rare mutations in both SAP130 and PCDHA genes.
Molecular analysis showed that heart cells in affected animals were poorly developed and had mitochondrial defects, indicating that Sap130–Pcdha9 gene interactions play a crucial role not only in heart development but also in regulating metabolic function of the cardiac muscle.
These findings suggest HLHS may be associated with a fundamental cellular defect in the heart muscle that can compromise blood flow in patients. This has important therapeutic implications, as surgical repair will not be able to address the cellular muscle defect in HLHS patients, noted Lo.
The researchers are investigating other mutations identified through the genetic screen and plan to undertake more genetic analysis of HLHS patients to better understand the molecular and genetic factors that cause the disease.
Other study authors included researchers from Pitt, The Jackson Laboratory, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Children's National Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, University of San Diego School of Medicine and Medical College of Wisconsin.
The study was supported by National Institutes of Health grants U01-HL098180, R01-HL132024, R01-GM104412, S10-OD010340, R01-MH094564, OD011185, the Children's Heart Foundation, and the Junior Cooperative Society.

Gary Gutting's recent piece in the New York Times "Opinionator" blog ("How Reliable are the Social Sciences?" May 17th, 2012) argues that fields such as economics, psychology, and sociology (1) fail to contribute "real" data of the kind produced by the natural sciences, (2) explain information that already exists, but provide no power to predict what will occur in the future, and (3) cannot provide any information of value in guiding public policy. These are serious charges that summarily dismiss the work of thousands of scientists. As such, it is critical to point out that Gutting's position is baseless and hostile to scientific progress.
Gutting suggests that social scientists employ the "paraphernalia" of science -- such as the technical terminology and statistical tests -- but do not apply these techniques to producing systematic, reliable data. Instead, Gutting focuses on small, exploratory studies, concluding that social sciences suffer from a pervasive case of "severely limited reliability." This claim is empty and irresponsible. Gutting is, of course, correct that policy should not be based on unreliable data, and that the press often 'overhypes' preliminary scientific findings. However, this problem is in no way unique to social sciences, which commonly produce robust, consistent effects that hold across hundreds of studies conducted and several decades.
Consider a recent "meta-analysis" (an aggregation of multiple studies, here including data from over 300,000 people) in which psychologists found that social isolation strongly predicts mortality -- at a level on par with other risks factors such as smoking and obesity. These findings easily meet the criteria that Gutting sets for meaningful data: they (1) are consistent and robust, (2) strongly predict that social isolation in new populations should similarly produce mortality risk, and (3) hold clear implications for policy. Physicians have long discounted the effects of social phenomena in predicting physical health, instead focusing on more "tangible" risk factors. Findings from psychology here demonstrate that this dualistic view is outdated, and suggest course corrections in medicine and public health.
More broadly, Gutting succumbs to an old stereotype: believing that there is a bright line between "hard" natural sciences -- which produce real information -- and "soft" social sciences, which do not. Such arguments reveal a misunderstanding of science's increasingly integrated nature. For example, in recent years, entirely new fields have spawned from collaborations between theoretical physics and sociology and between neurobiology and psychology.
10) DORIA (BOTAFOGO)
Given the shambles on show during the World Cup semi-final, Brazil will be relieved to hear that, in Doria, they potentially have the perfect long-term partner to Thiago Silva in central defence. This one does not go wandering onto the left wing when things get sticky, either.
Captain of Brazil's Toulon Tournament-winning side in 2013, Doria joined Botafogo at the age of 12 and is now a key part of their side despite still being just 19. He also has a senior international cap to accompany plenty of interest from abroad.
Serie A seems the most likely destination (both Juventus and Udinese have expressed an interest), but the likes of Porto and Benfica must also be considered as likely candidates to bring him to Europe. Watch this space.
9) OLIVER TORRES (PORTO, ON LOAN FROM ATLETICO MADRID)
Loaned to Villarreal for the latter stages of last season, when Diego Simeone considered experience more important than the exuberance of youth in Atletico's title run-in, Torres has now been loaned out to Porto for the whole of this season - a move that will at least see him play regular football.
A natural playmaker but with a slight frame, Torres possibly suffers slightly from his nationality - he is at the back of a long line of Spanish midfielders waiting for an international chance, with new £28million Manchester United signing Ander Herrera still waiting for his first cap.
Inevitably compared to Andres Iniesta (and labelled the 'Miniesta'), Torres is a midfielder with a wonderful knack for the simple pass, only to surprise you with something more adventurous so wonderful that it makes you wonder why he ever bothers to play it short.
After struggling to hold down a first-team place at the Calderon, it will be interesting to see how big an impact Torres can have in Portugal. It could be the making of him.
8) RYAN GAULD (SPORTING LISBON)
Scottish youngsters do not often move abroad to play football, so when Sporting Lisbon slapped a £48m buyout clause upon the head of £2m signing (and 18-year-old) Gauld, eyebrows were obviously raised. Then again, it is not that often that a Dundee United player gets compared to Lionel Messi.
With Sporting competing in the UEFA Champions League group stage and hoping to sustain another title bid, Gauld may have to bide his time in order to force his way into Marco Silva's first-team plans, and Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is yet to be fully convinced that this is the right move.
7) LUCAS PIAZON (CHELSEA)
In many ways, Piazon is the poster boy of Chelsea's FFP-satisfying stockpiling methods. Secured on a pre-contract agreement in 2011 when aged just 17, the forward has played on loan at both Malaga and Vitesse Arnhem, registering only 15 minutes of Premier League action. Now 20, the star of Brazil's Under-17 team has not made the step up to any of Brazil's more senior sides, and faces a crucial summer for his future development.
Another loan seems likely, perhaps this time in the Bundesliga.
6) RICHAIRO ZIVKOVIC (AJAX)
The youngest player on this list at just 17, Zivkovic signed a deal in March to leave Groningen for Ajax after turning down reported offers from Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Liverpool.
Ajax seems the perfect choice. Zivkovic can remain in the Netherlands for the rest of his footballing development, at a club famous for turning potential into the best it can be. Sixteen different players made league appearances for Ajax last season aged 23 or under, so the striker is in good company.
The last forward to transfer from Groningen to Ajax at a similar age? A certain Luis Suarez. Warm up that hyperbole machine.
5) AYMERIC LAPORTE (ATHLETIC BILBAO)
Only turning 20 in May, it has been a rapid rise for French-born Laporte since his Athletic Bilbao debut in December 2012, given the No.4 shirt less than a month later by Marcelo Bielsa. Three weeks after that, a new contract had been signed, including a €27.5m (£20m) release clause, and by April 2014 links with Barcelona and Bayern Munich had surfaced, a further contract extension signed.
One thing is for sure: another impressive season and a big-money move to a European giant would seem inevitable.
4) MAX MEYER (SCHALKE)
Thirty Bundesliga appearances for a team finishing third in the table, it is pretty easy to forget that Mayer was 17 years old at the start of last season.
There seems little doubt that the attacking midfielder will move on at some point. Following his Champions League display against Chelsea, there were reports that Jose Mourinho was considering lodging a €15m (£11.9m) bid, with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers rumoured to have made enquiries in June over his availability.
Before his inevitable move to Bayern Munich in summer 2015, therefore, we should appreciate watching a player that just seems to enjoy playing football, a fact he puts down to his love of futsal.
3) DOMENICO BERARDI (SASSUOLO, ON LOAN FROM JUVENTUS)
Within three months of Sassuolo's promotion to Serie A being confirmed, the inevitable had happened, 18-year-old forward Berardi joining Juventus on a co-ownership basis for a fee of €4.5m (£3.5m).
Remaining at Sassuolo on a season-long loan deal, few at Juventus could have foreseen quite how rapidly the youngster would take to life in the top league. Only six players scored more times as Berardi kept the small-town club on the big stage, including a fabulous first-half hat-trick away at Fiorentina. Thankfully for both player and club, he will remain for another season at least. Repeat his trick, and this is a talent that will be pushing for a start in bianconeri colours.
2) ADRIEN RABIOT (PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN)
Despite only turning 19 in April and being forced to fight for a place in a Paris Saint-Germain's central midfield, which includes the likes of Yohan Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi, Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti, Rabiot still made 25 Ligue 1 appearances last season.
At 17, Rabiot became the first homegrown player to sign a professional deal at PSG after the arrival of Sheikh El-Khelaifi's billions, and that makes him a favourite of supporters at the Parc des Princes. Despite being tall, Rabiot prefers to rely on beauty rather than brawn, gliding around the field.
Quick word, too, for Manchester United fans: Rabiot was allowed to leave Manchester City in 2005 after failing to impress the club's youth coaches sufficiently. This is your Paul Pogba payback.
1) ALEN HALILOVIC (BARCELONA)
Some on this list may be playing for their big move but, in the case of 18-year-old Croatian Halilovic, he has already earned it. The 'Croatian Messi' joined Barcelona in May for a fee of around £1.8m - at the time he was still 17.
It had been thought that Halilovic would spend time with Barcelona B, but his performance on debut last weekend may have persuaded Luis Enrique otherwise. In 45 minutes against Recreativo, the midfielder demonstrated the dribbling and balance that saw him given his senior international debut at just 16.
Bright, willing to take players on, prince of the well-weighted pass and deceptively difficult to knock off the ball, the easy comparisons with his new team-mate are only going to increase. You are about to see a lot more of Halilovic.

This is the Cover of “The Millennial Pastor”…
First and foremost – Artist Credit: Kassidy Heal
Allow me to explain…
Title: The Millennial Pastor – At this point I hope it's clear to you that I am a millennial who is also a lead pastor. Those two attributes are not very regularly seen together. If you aren't sure what a millennial is, check this out.
Subtitle: I became a lead pastor at 28 years old. This, along with being a millennial, is what inspired me to write this book. Also the phrase “I can't even” is credited to having been coined by millennials.
#Hashtags: Millennials love hashtags. I don't really love them and instead use them ironically. I'm strange, and it is for these reasons that I felt it significant to add them to my book's subtitle. If you want to read more on what a hashtag is, check this out.
Jesus: Yes, that is Jesus! Maybe you didn't recognize Him in his new duds!?!
Ok, here's the story…
Growing up I saw this picture of Jesus in the church I was raised in:
I was told as a child that it was very important to be like Jesus. That he said a lot of important things that we needed to listen to and live by. What always confused me was that Jesus looked a lot like me. He was Caucasian, had light brown hair (sometimes I even saw pictures of a blonde Jesus) and light brown eyes (in some pictures they were blue). In reality, Jesus didn't look like this. He lived in the Middle East and would have had much darker features. There has been an interesting amount of research done hoping to uncover exactly what Jesus looked like. I'm sure a quick Google search will give you any number of images showing a Jesus that looks little to nothing like the one in the image above. The most common one I have found is this one:
This image was rendered by a forensic anthropologist. You can read about how this image came to life here (http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a234/1282186/). All of this got me thinking.
Jesus is one of history's most central figures. So much is made about Him. Christian or not, you would be hard-pressed to find many credible sources who argue the existence of this man. There are obviously plenty who would contest beliefs held about his divine nature, but the fact remains that most would agree he existed. If you say the name Jesus, you are more than likely going to elicit a response. He can be a very controversial subject and I wasn't about to shy away from that.
Since Jesus is such a big deal, since so many have such wide opinions and beliefs about Him, I thought I would add to the conversation and share my own perspective. To some extent, I felt lied to when I realized that Jesus most certainly didn't look like the picture I saw growing up in Sunday school. It bothered me. I wanted to be like Jesus since that's what I was taught, but what I realized was happening was an attempt to make Jesus more like me.
I think that's dangerous for Christians to do by the way… perhaps that was not the artists' intentions but that was certainly my perception. We do it with more than just his image, we also do it by picking and choosing to heed only some of the things He says. I mean, how basic is the command Jesus gave when He said, “Love your neighbor as yourself?” Something so basic should be easy for his followers to do, but if you have spent any time on the internet, watching the news, or talking to other humans, you know that we, His followers, most certainly fall short.
This is my ironic commentary on how I feel we censor Jesus, when we make him more like us instead of becoming more like him. I am a millennial, so it made sense to me to make Jesus look like a millennial. This was especially poignant knowing that Jesus comes for the outcasts, the marginalized, those that the religious institutions of the day had belittled with their legalism and so-called piety.
Today, millennials would more than fit into that category. No other generation is more absent from the church than millennials. No other generation (currently, this may obviously change in the future) is more misunderstood by the church than millennials. Sometimes, no other age bracket is more written off by the church than millennials.
We are supposed to be like Jesus if we claim to be part of His church. We are supposed to care about what He cares about, talk like he talks, and act the way He told us to act.
If Jesus came today, who would He spend his time with? See, millennials don't have a problem with Jesus, but they do have an issue with the church. The issues they claim to have is that the church who says it wants to follow Jesus tends to look nothing like Him…
The church is teetering on a precipice of irrelevancy, but Jesus is anything but irrelevant.
Listen to what Paul, one of Jesus' most influential follows, has to say on the subject:
1 Corinthians 9:20-23 20 I act like a Jew to the Jews, so I can recruit Jews. I act like I'm under the Law to those under the Law, so I can recruit those who are under the Law (though I myself am not under the Law). 21 I act like I'm outside the Law to those who are outside the Law, so I can recruit those outside the Law (though I'm not outside the law of God but rather under the law of Christ). 22 I act weak to the weak, so I can recruit the weak. I have become all things to all people, so I could save some by all possible means. 23 All the things I do are for the sake of the gospel, so I can be a partner with it. (CEB)
Jesus offers grace and hope to all who will hear and He wants his followers to be the voice that tells this to the world, even to millennials.
Jesus cares about millennials outside the church just as much as He cares about those in the church. Maybe, just maybe… he would dress like one, too…

SAN FRANCISCO — In 2011, two Dutch hackers in their early 20s made a target list of 100 high-tech companies they would try to hack. Soon, they had found security vulnerabilities in Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Twitter and 95 other companies' systems.
They called their list the Hack 100.
When they alerted executives of those companies, about a third ignored them. Another third thanked them, curtly, but never fixed the flaws, while the rest raced to solve their issues. Thankfully for the young hackers, no one called the police.
Now the duo, Michiel Prins and Jobert Abma, are among the four co-founders of a San Francisco tech start-up that aims to become a mediator between companies with cybersecurity issues and hackers like them who are looking to solve problems rather than cause them. They hope their outfit, called HackerOne, can persuade other hackers to responsibly report security flaws, rather than exploit them, and connect those “white hats” with companies willing to pay a bounty for their finds.
In the last year, the start-up has persuaded some of the biggest names in tech — including Yahoo, Square and Twitter — and companies you might never expect, like banks and oil companies, to work with their service. They have also convinced venture capitalists that, with billions more devices moving online and flaws inevitable in each, HackerOne has the potential to be very lucrative. HackerOne gets a 20 percent commission on top of each bounty paid through its service.
Bill Clinton Changes Story Again… Now Says Hillary Clinton Has Contagious Walking Pneumonia
Wow!
Bill Clinton switches the story again!
Bubba told a Vegas crowd on Wednesday Hillary has “the flu” which is not exactly the story they were pushing on Sunday when she collapsed at Ground Zero.
Bill Clinton: I just talked to her and she's feeling great and I think she'll be back out there tomorrow. So, it's crazy time we live in, you know, when people think there's something unusual about getting the flu.Last time I checked millions of people were getting it every year.
** Last week Hillary had “allergies” when she couldn't stop coughing for 4 minutes straight.
** On Sunday she overheated.
** Then the campaign said she had pneumonia.
** Then on Wednesday she had the flu.
And now this…
Bill says Hillary has Walking Pneumonia!
Vessel News reported:
During a taping of Comedy Central's “The Daily Show”, Bill told host Trevor Noah he wasn't surprised that Hillary fainted at the 9/11 memorial. “She felt good, but it's not surprising,” Bill Clinton said. “You showed that clip of President Obama in Philadelphia and somebody faints, it happens a lot to me, and 90 percent of the time it's just people are dehydrated, and, so, I didn't worry too much about it. Sure enough, she got examined, that's what the doctor said, but she also said she did have pneumonia. Used to be called walking pneumonia when I was young, but sometimes you can't walk, you have to rest and that's what she did.”

Even though Congress in general seems pretty clueless on matters financial (the Wall Street/high-end variety), some members appear to understand the mindset.
One consequence of the ever-delayed “buy the bad assets” program, which clearly has to pay at or above banks' current marks (otherwise they show losses, which hurts their capital bases, something that the Fed/Treasury team is keen to avoid) is that banks have no incentive to unload that paper now. They might as well wait to see what the sugar daddy from Washington has to offer.
From Reuters:
Global credit markets are unlikely to revive as long as the U.S. government continues to dangle the vague prospect of a toxic asset purchase plan in front of distressed banks, some lawmakers warned on Wednesday.
The chance that taxpayers could be made to overpay for underperforming assets is making bankers, whose balance sheets are saddled with them, reluctant to sell to lower bidders, suggested Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer.
“People are afraid to buy and afraid to sell because they're afraid the government is going to sweeten the deal,” he told Reuters in an interview. “The markets are just waiting to see when we're going to be done.”
Uncertainty about the government's strategy for toxic assets props up their value above what private investors might pay for them and delays potential resolution of the problems they pose, said California Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman.
“As long as there's the prospect the federal government will overpay for the toxic assets … these banks would be insane to sell” in the private market, Sherman told Reuters.
“As long as they hold the toxic assets, they have regular value, plus a politically enhanced value that you may be able to sell it to Uncle Sam for more than it's worth. Why dispose of an asset where it has politically enhanced value?”…
Neugebauer hit on the toxic assets issue in questioning of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) Lloyd Blankfein and Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Vikram Pandit.
Both CEOs told Neugebauer they could sell some of the worst toxic assets on their balance sheets, but they won't because the price private investors would pay is too low.
“That low price is generated by the fear in general … and the lack of risk capital,” Blankfein said.
Similarly, Pandit said: “When we look at some of the assets that we hold, we have a duty to our shareholders. The duty is that if it turns out they're marked so far below what our lifetime expected credit losses are, we can't sell them.”
T here's an old saying that “bad facts make bad law.” In other words, the desire to punish bad people and prevent perceived miscarriages of justice can lead judges to craft overbroad or oppressive opinions that ultimately lead to far worse outcomes. But judges are supposed to wrestle with bad facts, tease out the true and appropriate legal standards, and keep in mind the consequences of their opinions. So, no, bad facts don't make bad law. Bad judges do.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals just suffered from an outbreak of bad judging. In an en banc opinion, the court ruled that after a lawful traffic stop, the police may frisk any person who they believe may possess a firearm, regardless of whether that person possesses a concealed-carry permit. The court actually typed this sentence: “The danger justifying a protective frisk arises from the combination of a forced police encounter and the presence of a weapon, not from any illegality of the weapon's possession” (emphasis added.) The implications were clear: Even lawful gun owners are by definition “dangerous” and can be broadly treated as such by the state.
Before I get to the sad weakness of the court's reasoning, let's discuss the specific facts of U.S. v. Robinson, the case that brought us to this strange and perilous place. Police received a call that a man “in a parking lot well known for drug-trafficking activity” loaded a gun, put it in his pocket, and got in the passenger side of a car. Let's pause for a moment and note that there is nothing inherently unlawful about any of that. It's not unlawful to walk in a dangerous area, ride in cars in dangerous areas, or carry guns in dangerous areas. Indeed, it might well be prudent to carry where the danger is greatest.
Police later pulled over the car (the driver and passenger weren't wearing seatbelts). Given the report that the passenger might be armed, the officer asked him to step out of the car rather than dig in his pocket for ID. The passenger, Shaquille Robinson, stepped outside. As he did, the officer asked him whether he was armed. Robinson gave the officer a “weird look,” an “Oh, crap” look that the officer interpreted as “I don't want to lie to you, but I'm not going to tell you anything.”
The officer frisked Robinson, found that he was carrying a weapon, and then recognized that he was a convicted felon. The officer then promptly arrested him as a felon in possession of a gun.
Robinson challenged the frisk, claiming that it violated his Fourth Amendment rights. He acknowledged that the officer had the right to stop the car and ask him to exit. He also acknowledged that the tip that he was armed was sufficiently reliable for the officer to act on it. Robinson contested the notion that the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that he was armed and dangerous. After all, he argued, putting a firearm in your pocket is “innocent behavior” that was not by itself “sufficient to indicate that he posed a danger to others.”
Here, Robinson is surely right. Putting a firearm in your pocket is just as innocent as getting in a car and turning the ignition. In states that require concealed-carry permits, carrying a gun and driving a car are both lawful activities that require a license, and you can no more presume that a person carrying a gun lacks a permit than you can presume that a person driving a car lacks a license.
Moreover, the evidence is simply overwhelming that holders of concealed-carry permits are extraordinarily law-abiding — perhaps even more law-abiding than the police . According to the Crime Prevention Research Center, police commit crimes at a rate of roughly 124 crimes per 100,000 officers. That's an extraordinarily low rate (the general public's crime rate is 31 times greater). In Florida, by contrast, concealed-carry permit holders committed misdemeanors or felonies at a rate of 12.5 per 100,000. In Texas, the rate was 20.5 per 100,000. In other words, “armed” does not equal “dangerous” when a person carries lawfully, with a permit. Lawful gun owners are not a threat to the public or to the police.
But don't tell that to a majority of the Fourth Circuit. To them, armed is dangerous, and your decision to lawfully carry a weapon opens you to the possibility of a police frisk merely because you exercise a constitutional right. Indeed, Judge James Wynn, writing in concurrence, made the majority's reasoning terrifyingly clear:
In sum, individuals who carry firearms — lawfully or unlawfully — pose a risk of danger to themselves, law enforcement officers, and the public at large. Accordingly, law enforcement officers may frisk lawfully stopped individuals whom the officers reasonably suspect are carrying a firearm because a detainee's possession of a firearm poses a categorical “danger” to the officers.
So, if concealed-carry permit holders are presumptively dangerous, does this mean that they forfeit other constitutional rights? Wynn explained (approvingly) that under the majority's reasoning they certainly do:
I see no basis — nor does the majority opinion provide any — for limiting our conclusion that individuals who choose to carry firearms are categorically dangerous to the Terry frisk inquiry. Accordingly, the majority decision today necessarily leads to the conclusion that individuals who elect to carry firearms forego other constitutional rights, like the Fourth Amendment right to have law enforcement officers “knock-and-announce” before forcibly entering homes. . . . Likewise, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that individuals who choose to carry firearms necessarily face greater restriction on their concurrent exercise of other constitutional rights, like those protected by the First Amendment.
In essence, the Fourth Circuit is declaring that gun owners lawfully exercising their constitutional rights are to be viewed with particular suspicion by law enforcement, regardless of any empirical evidence of danger. The court is relegating lawful gun owners to second-class-citizen status.
The court is relegating lawful gun owners to second-class-citizen status.
Even worse, it did so gratuitously. It could have analyzed Robinson's claims on the facts, asking whether the fact that he loaded his gun in a high-crime area and acted suspiciously after the stop justified the frisk (probably not, which is likely one reason why the majority reached for a new standard). Or it could have noted that in jurisdictions that require concealed-carry permits, when officers reasonably suspect that a person is armed, they can ask to see the citizen's carry permit and conduct a search if he can't produce it. Instead, however, it wrote a new law.
Make no mistake, imposing a series of new and unconstitutional burdens on gun owners is a form of gun control. It's a judge-made deterrent against gun ownership, concocted out of whole cloth. The court legislated from the bench, and federal, state, and so now local authorities in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Maryland can treat lawful gun owners as toxic, depriving them of other constitutional rights, all in order to promote “the safety of persons and property.”
Beware, lawful gun owners, the court has branded you with a scarlet “G.” You are a danger to yourself, your neighbors, and the state. You exercised your rights, and now the court has deprived you of your liberties.
Vice President Mike Pence told high school students that President Trump "literally embodies American leadership." (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
So much for that speculation about Vice President Mike Pence distancing himself from President Trump amid the uproar over Trump Jr.'s Russia emails.
On Wednesday at American University, Pence, who called those news reports "offensive," delivered a speech that was dripping with adulation for his boss. Speaking to the National Student Leadership Conference, Pence glorified Trump as someone "who literally embodies American leadership." He called "The Art of the Deal," Trump's book from 30 years ago, "actually an American classic" that "holds words of wisdom for all future leaders that are gathered here today." He told the gathered group of outstanding high school students that "you couldn't have picked a better time to study leadership" and "at this very moment, we're seeing the bold leadership of an American president on the world stage."
Yet the praise didn't end there. Pence went on to hold up Trump as an example when he talked about the importance of humility in leaders. "Our president, he leads by asking questions and he listens," Pence told the students, sharing the story of a meeting with tech executives during the transition, when he said Trump asked questions and listened to the executives for much of two hours. "And I believe that reflects the kind of humility that will enhance your ability to be a leader."
Trump may be many things, but humble is not one of them. Even for anyone who may hold up "The Art of the Deal" as a brilliant guide to business or who believes a man who says "I alone can fix it" embodies American democratic leadership, it defies reality to think of Trump as a leader who reflects humility. The president brags constantly, appears unwilling to admit his mistakes, and remains focused on outside measures of his popularity, whether they be ratings, polls or crowd size.
[Why a Cabinet of kiss-ups is a big problem for Trump]
Yet there was his No. 2, holding up humility as one of the three key ingredients for good leadership and using Trump as an example. Those three essentials -- which he also laid out at his U.S. Naval Academy commencement speech in May -- include an orientation toward authority, an aptitude for self-control (notably, he did not reference his impulsively tweeting boss in this passage) and a capacity for humility. "It's often in too scarce a supply in our society today," Pence said, "The truth of the matter is that some of the most compelling leaders I've ever known in my life are people that are focused on others more than themselves, are considerate to others."
Pence, of course, made no mention of all the insults his boss has hurled on Twitter. Or to his speech accepting the nomination at the Republican National Convention, when he boldly claimed that "nobody knows the system better than me." Or how Trump began his presidency by speaking in front of the CIA's Memorial Wall about what "looked like a million, a million and a half people" at his inauguration and how "God looked down and he said we're not going to let it rain on your speech."
The list of Trump's boasts are endless. He bragged as his presidency's 100-day milestone neared, saying that "no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days," later amending the claim to make an exception for FDR. He bragged that "a lot of people have said" his speech in front of a Joint Session of Congress "was the single best speech ever made in that chamber."
He recounted in interviews -- incorrectly, according to the Democratic lawmaker in question -- that Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) had said he would "go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country." He's crowed about his ratings. About the size of his electoral college win. Even about polls that showed less than half the country approve of his performance.
Humility as a trait in leaders, of course, is much more than just a willingness to not gloat about your latest achievement or repeat others' accolades at every turn. It includes a capacity to admit your own shortcomings. It involves sharing mistakes publicly and vulnerably so you and your team can learn from them. It consists of the ability to apologize when errors are made, to forgive others rather than hold grudges and to deflect attention toward your team rather than yourself.
[Would it really 'never hurt' for Trump to apologize?]
At least publicly, Trump rarely if ever does these things. In his first full Cabinet meeting in June, Trump listened as his team engaged in a round of on-camera fawning that drew comparisons to "King Lear." He has lashed out at people who criticize him. Even when members of his own party suggested he apologize for saying President Obama tapped his phones or that Britain's main surveillance agency had spied on him, he didn't.
After the initial healthcare bill he pushed failed, he was asked to reflect on lessons learned: "Just another day in paradise, okay?" he told The Post's Robert Costa. And when asked whether he regrets any of his tweets, he has said "I don't regret anything, because there is nothing you can do about it."
Trump may indeed ask a lot of questions and listen closely in meetings -- particularly in those with CEOs, or even "every day," as Pence said in the speech. And as a candidate, Trump himself may have said that he has "much more humility than a lot of people would think" and doesn't show it because "I'd rather not play my cards. I want to be unpredictable."
But truly humble leaders do much more than listen in meetings. And they don't hide their humility from the world. They demonstrate it whenever possible, setting an example by not constantly touting their successes, by redirecting attention toward their team, and by admitting freely and publicly when they've made a mistake and what they've learned from it. That's the sort of humility that makes for good leadership.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The trial lawyer who led the effort to allow marijuana for medical uses in Florida filed a lawsuit Thursday against the state's decision to ban smokable forms of the plant.
Smoking marijuana is the best way to administer it to some patients with debilitating conditions such as Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS, lawyer John Morgan said at a news conference outside the Leon County courthouse where he filed the suit.
Republican Gov. Rick Scott signed the bill into law last month implementing the constitutional amendment, but lawmakers banned smoking marijuana, saying that smoking isn't healthy.
Republican State Rep. Ray Rodrigues, who sponsored the bill, said he is confident the law will stand as is. He said lawmakers studied the science of medical marijuana and crafted a law that provides all the benefits without the health risks.
“If smoking was their intent, they should have declared it,” Rodrigues said.
The law does allow vaping and marijuana products sold as edibles, oils, sprays or tinctures.
Morgan, who is considering a run for governor as a Democrat next year, scoffed at the idea that the state should be concerned about the health effects of marijuana smoke for someone who is on their deathbed.
“For Ray Rodrigues to say he's concerned about a cancer patient smoking a few hits of marijuana so that they can kill the nausea is ridiculous,” Morgan said. “Do we give a rat's ass if a person dying from ALS smokes instead of vapes? I don't, and I trust the doctors to figure out what's best for that patient, not Ray Rodrigues.”
Morgan spent millions of dollars to get the medical marijuana amendment passed. A 2014 effort fell just short of the 60 percent voter support it needed to pass. A second effort in 2016 was easily approved with 71 percent support.
Morgan has taken his fight against the smoking ban to social media, where he is using the hashtag (hash)NoSmokeIsAJoke.
Scott's office referred a request for comment to the state Department of Health, which wouldn't comment other than to say the suit is being reviewed.

NEW YORK — Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas) 7-foot center Stephen Zimmerman announced late Thursday that he plans to attend UNLV next season. Zimmerman, who is playing in today's Jordan Brand Classic in Brooklyn, won four state titles while at Bishop Gorman. He chose the hometown Rebels over Kansas, Kentucky, Arizona and UCLA. Zimmerman's mother, Lori Stevens, went to school with UNLV coach Dave Rice at UNLV.
It is worth noting, however, that Zimmerman, like some other recent high-profile athletes, has said he does not plan to sign a National Letter of Intent.
Zimmerman's announcement came via Twitter:
Thx 2 all the programs & fans that supported me. This is MY decision & I've decided 2 stay home & attend #UNLV #LetsRun #Vegas — Stephen Zimmerman Jr (@BIGG_ZIMM) April 17, 2015
Then, he followed it with this awesome Tweet:
Zimmerman averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds last season at Bishop Gorman. With his announcement, the Rebels are officially on a roll. On Wednesday, the first day of the regular signing period for basketball, UNLV signed Derrick Jones of Archbishop Carroll (Radnor, Pa.).
Jones, a 6-7 small forward was Archbishop Carroll's highest scorer in school history and had 1,645 points and had 1,029 rebounds in his career.
Atheist Ireland briefs UN about religious discrimination in Ireland
Atheist Ireland has just made the following statement to the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Geneva, Switzerland. We will next be attending a more detailed briefing session with UN Committee members, then the Committee will be questioning Ireland about its human rights record. The Twitter hashtag for the sessions is #UNIRL
ORAL STATEMENT by Jane Donnelly and Michael Nugent of Atheist Ireland
Education System
Ireland repeatedly ignores UN recommendations to respect the rights of atheists and non-Christians, in the treaties on Civil and Political Rights, Rights of the Child, Racial Discrimination and ESC Rights.
This Covenant obliges Ireland to guarantee the rights within it without discrimination. Ireland repeatedly fails to do this, particularly in the education system.
Ireland still has no non-denominational schools, at primary or secondary level. Primary schools are still publicly funded private bodies, almost all Christian, with a near-monopoly on a vital public service, and no effective remedy to vindicate Covenant rights.
These State-funded private schools can still demand Christian baptism certs for admission. The new Admission to Schools Bill retains the right to discriminate against atheist, Muslim and other minority faith families.
If you do get your child into a school, you still face two problems. If you want to opt your child out of formal religious instruction classes, there are no non-discriminatory exemptions or alternatives.
And the Education Act and Rule 68 of National Schools integrate a religious ethos throughout the entire curriculum, thus depriving your child of a neutral studying environment, even outside of the formal religious instruction classes.
If you are a teacher, your school can discriminate against you based on your atheism. The new Bill to protect LGBT teachers retains the right to discriminate against atheist teachers.
Systemic Discrimination
The education system is not an isolated case. Ireland systemically breaches the Covenant rights of atheists and non-Christians, in the Education Act, Admissions to Schools Bill, Equal Status Act, Employment Equality Act, Civil Registration Act, religious oaths for political and legal jobs, our blasphemy law, our abortion law, and the lack of an effective remedy.
Ireland has no plans to adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination laws to include all the grounds referred to in article 2, paragraph 2, of this Covenant.
Ireland has told this Committee that our equality laws protect the rights in the Covenant. But our Minister for Education, and our Minister of State for Equality, have both recently said that a Constitutional Referendum would be needed to remove discrimination against atheists in our education system.
So not only are Ireland's anti discrimination laws incompatible with the Covenant, our Constitution itself is also incompatible with the Covenant, and there is no effective remedy through the courts to vindicate the rights guaranteed by the Covenant.
Even though Ireland accepted, here in Geneva, last year, that majority votes cannot be used to derogate from Covenant rights, including on abortion law, Ireland continues to rely on majority votes to defend breaches of these rights.
These problems are outlined in detail in Atheist Ireland's written submissions to this Committee.
São Paulo (Reuters) - President Dilma Rousseff's narrow re-election victory met with cold reality on Monday as Brazil's financial markets tumbled on doubts that she can restore confidence in the economy and maintain political support in a sharply divided nation.
Rousseff overcame dissatisfaction with a sluggish economy and poor public services to clinch a second term on Sunday by a slim margin, dashing the hopes of investors and nearly half the electorate who bet on her pro-business challenger.
Finance Minister Guido Mantega, whose replacement is the focus of intense speculation, tried to beat back the pessimism with promises to control inflation and close a budget deficit in the four years ahead, although he added that the election showed popular approval for Rousseff's economic policies.
Brazil's currency, the real BRBY, extended losses after Mantega's comments, closing at 2.52 per dollar, its weakest level since April 2005.
Rousseff said last month that Mantega would step down at the end of the year, and government sources say her short list of potential replacements includes a businessman, a former finance ministry official and her current chief of staff.
Whoever takes the reins at the finance ministry, investors are skeptical that Rousseff can pull off a swift recovery, or make a dramatic shift toward market-friendly polices, after four years of ineffective industrial measures.
She now faces the challenge of delivering on campaign promises to expand social benefits for the poor while balancing a strained federal budget.
Major state-run companies whose profits have suffered under Rousseff plunged in Monday trading, including a more than 12 percent drop for scandal-plagued oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA), its biggest one-day decrease in nearly six years.
The benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP fell 5 percent early in the day and closed 2.72 percent lower.
Fitch Ratings, which still rates Brazil's debt two levels into investment grade, said on Monday that it continues to evaluate Rousseff's ability to revive growth and pursue less interventionist policies.
Rousseff “will face a challenging economic environment, highlighting the need for policy adjustments to address some of the macroeconomic imbalances that have emerged,” Shelly Shetty, Fitch's senior director for Latin America, said in a note.
Investors hope a more market-friendly finance minister can help restore fiscal discipline, bring transparency to the federal budget and better engage with business leaders. Some believe that Rousseff will be forced by economic realities to soften some of her interventionist policies.
Announcements of new cabinet members are unlikely in coming days, presidential aides said, as Rousseff rests after a demanding campaign that went down to a photo finish.
Still, she already faces pressure from her own party to choose a finance minister, who if not from the party, is at least aligned with longstanding party thinking.
“We always prefer a party member,” Rui Falcao, the Workers' Party president, told reporters Monday. “But what's essential is that the general lines of economic policy, as they have been practiced, are maintained.”
‘BE A BETTER PRESIDENT'
Speaking to a relieved crowd of supporters on Sunday night, Rousseff struggled to raise her voice as she acknowledged the call for change expressed by many voters in remarks that some observers hoped were a sign of a shift to the center.
“I know that I am being sent back to the presidency to make the big changes that Brazilian society demands,” she said after winning the runoff with 51.6 percent of the votes. “I want to be a much better president than I have been until now.”
Her slim, three-point margin over centrist candidate Aecio Neves came largely thanks to gains against inequality and poverty since the Workers' Party first came to power in 2003.
Using the fruits of a commodity-fueled economic boom in the last decade, Brazil's government expanded welfare programs that helped lift more than 40 million people from poverty despite the current economic woes.

The “Brazilian model” has been adopted by center-left parties across Latin America and Rousseff's victory, however narrow, is a blow for conservatives in the region.
It also means there will be no dramatic improvement in ties with the United States, hit in recent years by trade disputes and U.S. government spying programs that infuriated Rousseff.
About 40 percent of Brazil's 200 million people live in households earning less than $700 a month, and it was their overwhelming support that gave Rousseff victory on Sunday.
Now she pledges to deepen social benefits while working to revive an economy that fell into recession this year.
In her victory speech, Rousseff also renewed her calls for a political reform to reduce corporate influence in campaign finance and restore faith in Brazil's messy multi-party politics. The president will have a tougher time with far-reaching reforms, however, after her coalition lost seats in both houses of Congress this year.
“Such a tight result reduces her capacity to radicalize policies,” said Alberto Bernal, a Miami-based economist with Bulltick Capital Markets. “Pretty much half of the country is against what she has been doing.”
MORE HEADWINDS
A sluggish economy will also make Rousseff's second term tougher, straining a government model accustomed to high tax revenues to finance social programs and subsidized credit for companies and consumers.
Brazil's economy, after growing by as much as 7.5 percent the year before she took office, is on track to expand less than 1 percent this year. Prior efforts to gun growth, largely through tax breaks and other subsidies for select industries, have largely fallen flat.
Meanwhile, inflation, long a problem in a country with a history of runaway prices, is now hovering above the government's tolerance ceiling of 6.5 percent.
And while unemployment is near record lows, economists don't expect it to remain so for long as plunging investment, slower growth and further uncertainty prompt employers to cut back.

To correct the course, economists say Rousseff must pursue long-pending tax and labor reforms in order to increase productivity and engage further with the global marketplace.
But Rousseff will face gridlock in a Congress increasingly weary of the ruling party, which lost seats in this election along with its most important ally. Leading lawmakers promise to make hay over a snowballing corruption scandal at state-run oil company Petrobras.
“After a brilliantly executed re-election campaign, Rousseff will need brilliantly executed economic policy to get Brazil moving again anytime soon,” wrote Citi analysts Stephen Graham and Fernando Siqueira in a note to clients.
“The prospects of that we believe are low.”
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Students may soon be able to receive college credit for the free online courses that are reshaping higher education.
The American Council on Education announced Thursday that it is recommending degree credit for five courses offered by Coursera, a Mountain View-based company that provides "massive open online courses" from leading universities.
Many colleges and universities use the association's recommendations to determine whether to grant credit for nontraditional courses.
Molly Corbett Broad, the council's president, said the decision is "an important first step in ACE's work to examine the long-term potential of MOOCs and whether this innovative new approach can engage students across the country and worldwide."
Over the past year, dozens of leading universities have begun offering free, digital versions of their most popular courses, allowing tens of thousands of students to take a class at the same time. But so far, few institutions have offered degree credit for them.
Allowing students to get credit for the massive online courses could help make it easier to earn a college degree, said John Aubrey Douglass, a higher education researcher at the University of California, Berkeley.
"As long as we can assess and ensure quality, it's providing one more way that students can receive an education at an affordable cost," Douglass said.
The American Council on Education, which represents U.S. degree-granting institutions, is recommending credit for five entry-level classes: Algebra and Pre-Calculus from the University of California, Irvine; Introduction to Genetics and Evolution from Duke University; Bioelectricity: A Quantitative Approach from Duke University; and Calculus: Single Variable from the University of Pennsylvania.
The courses themselves are free, but students seeking credit will need to pay between $100 and $190 to verify their identities, take exams monitored by webcam and receive transcripts with the council's credit recommendations.
Ultimately, the institution where the student wants credit will decide whether the units will count toward a degree.
"There are many working adults today that do not have a college degree. I hope the convenience of an online class can be a first step for many of these adults to go back to school to earn their degrees," Andrew Ng, a Stanford University researcher who co-founded Coursera, told The Associated Press.
Coursera, which now offers more than 200 open courses from 33 institutions, plans to seek the council's credit recommendations for more classes in the future, Ng said. Many of the courses are automated and require little oversight from instructors.
The announcement comes less than a week after Coursera suspended an online course offered by Georgia Institute of Technology because of technical troubles. The course, which was about how to run an online course, will be offered again at later date, Ng said.

In addition to the cuts, the following players were placed on injured reserve:
WR Michael Campanaro
WR Chris Matthews
OT De'Ondre Wesley
DB Carrington Byndom (waived/injured)
Second-year tight ends Darren Waller and Nick Boyle also opened up roster spots because they are suspended to open the season. Waller is suspended four games and Boyle will be out 10 games.
The most surprising move of the cuts was the decision to release Forsett, who has been the team's starting running back the last two years. Cutting him leaves the Ravens with just two healthy running backs in Terrance West and Buck Allen. Rookie running back Kenneth Dixon was impressive in the preseason, but a knee injury in the third game is expected to sideline him the first few games.
Forsett, 30, was just one year into a three-year deal with the Ravens that he signed in March of 2015. In his two years with Baltimore, Forsett played 26 games and rushed for 1,907 yards and 10 touchdowns. He was voted to the Pro Bowl after a breakout 2014 season.
The plot thickens.. 樂 #GodIsInControl — Justin Forsett (@JForsett) September 3, 2016
The other notable moves include cutting Brooks, Reynolds, Butler and Arthur Brown.
Brown (second round) and Brooks (third round) were both former high draft picks, but they had yet to turn the corner in their development. They would both have been backups if they made the team, and the Ravens opted to use their roster spots elsewhere.
Butler was the team's biggest playermaker of the preseason, but that wasn't enough to carve out a role at a crowded receiver position. The Ravens decided to carry just five wide receivers, unless they make any more changes at the position heading into the regular season.
With Campanaro, he just couldn't shake the injury problems that have plagued him throughout his career. He missed time in training camp with a calf issue, and now he's headed to injured reserve for the third year in a row.
In terms of the players who made the team, undrafted rookie Michael Pierce was one of the biggest surprises. He had a stellar preseason and he will make it 13 years in a row that an undrafted rookie has made Baltimore's roster coming out of training camp.
Keeping cornerback Sheldon Price was also somewhat unexpected, as keeping him gives the Ravens seven cornerbacks on the squad. Baltimore may have decided to keep him given that they've seen how valuable cornerback depth has been over the last few years.
The Ravens could still have roster movement over the next week. Safety Matt Elam, who is sidelined for several weeks with a knee injury, could go to injured reserve to open a roster spot.
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) says there is no evidence that proves Tehran is edging towards developing nuclear weapons.
Departing CIA Director Michael Hayden said Thursday that the Islamic Republic's production of low-enriched uranium does not necessarily substantiate an Iranian objective to build atomic weaponry.He said that even if the country does gain the capability to create highly enriched uranium, still there is no “clear proof” that Iran will use the material to fuel a nuclear warhead.Washington accuses Tehran of developing a nuclear military program. Iran, a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), insists its program is poised for the civilian applications of the technology.This is while UN nuclear watchdog Director General Mohamed ElBaradei disputed Western claims and ruled out suggestions that the Iranian nuclear program should be considered hostile.“They[Iranians], as I just recently mentioned still don't even have the nuclear material, the low-enriched uranium, to develop one nuclear weapon,” he said in an address to the London City Hall.“But even if they decide to walk out tomorrow from the Non-Proliferation Treaty - and you go into a lot of scenarios - it is not that we are going to see Iran tomorrow having nuclear weapons.”The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has extensively monitored Iran's nuclear work since 2003, said in its latest report that it could not find any ‘components of a nuclear weapon' or ‘related nuclear physics studies' in the country.(Source: Press TV)

Priti Patel has apologised for holding a series of undisclosed meetings with senior Israeli officials during a private holiday over the summer.
The international development secretary met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior figures without "following the usual procedures".
Ms Patel apologised for not informing the Foreign Office and suggesting Boris Johnson knew in advance of the visit.
Labour said the "shocking" admission warranted a Cabinet Office inquiry.
Downing Street said it welcomed Ms Patel's "clarification" and that at a meeting with Theresa May earlier, the prime minister had "reminded her of the obligations which exist under the ministerial code".
No 10 said it had not been aware of Ms Patel's meeting with Mr Netanyahu until Friday but insisted that Mrs May still had confidence in the minister.
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there were clear rules about what ministers could and could not do and "in normal circumstances" Ms Patel would be in "serious trouble".
But he said the fragility of Mrs May's government and the fact that the PM would not want to lose another cabinet minister after Sir Michael Fallon's recent resignation could help her.
The BBC revealed on Friday that Ms Patel held a number of undisclosed meetings with business and political figures during a family holiday in August, including Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party and Jean Judes, executive director of disability charity BIS.
No diplomats were present at the meetings, at which the minister was accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative peer and campaigner Lord Polak.
Ms Patel, who is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Israel defended her actions, saying she had paid for the holiday herself and while in Israel had taken the opportunity to meet "people and organisations" for the purpose of building links between the two countries.
'Enthusiasm'
She also told the Guardian that "Boris [Johnson] knew about the visit, the point is that the Foreign Office did know about this".
Suggesting that the reaction to her visit had been "extraordinary", she added that it was "for the Foreign Office to go away and explain themselves".
But in a statement "clarifying her position", Ms Patel said she had in fact attended 12 meetings, not just the handful previously reported, and that her earlier comments may have "implied" otherwise.
Among meetings that were not previously reported, she said that she had met Mr Netanyahu to discuss his forthcoming visit to the UK as well as the Israeli "domestic political scene" and UK-Israeli collaboration.
Image copyright PA Image caption Ms Patel discussed Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the UK
She said she had also met other senior figures in the Israeli government, including security minister Gilad Erdan and foreign ministry official Yuval Rotem.
Ms Patel has also set the record straight about when the government was informed about the trip.
While the Foreign Office was aware of the visit "while it was under way", she said she was wrong to have given the impression that the department and Mr Johnson knew about it in advance.
'Mis-read'
She said she "regretted the lack of precision in the wording" of her previous statement about the trip.
"This summer I travelled to Israel, on a family holiday paid for myself," she said in a statement.
"While away I had the opportunity to meet a number of people and organisations...In hindsight, I can see how my enthusiasm to engage in this way could be mis-read, and how meetings were set up and reported in a way which did not accord with the usual procedures. I am sorry for this and I apologise for it.
"My first and only aim as the Secretary of State for International Development is to put the interests of British taxpayers and the world's poor at the front of our development work."
In her statement, Ms Patel also said the Foreign Office was clear that the UK's interests were "not damaged or affected" by her actions.
Labour has called for an inquiry into whether Ms Patel broke the ministerial code or the rules on lobbying.
"Not only does it look like she has broken the ministerial code, she has now been caught misleading the British public," shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor said.
"If she does not now resign, then Theresa May must immediately refer the issue to the Cabinet Office for a full investigation."
Downing Street said the ministerial code was "not explicit" in this area and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heyward had been asked to see if it could be made clearer.
During October 2012, a historic cemetery in White County was destroyed during construction of the Lonoke-White Public Water Authority project.
Little Cypress Cemetery also known as Killough Cemetery is located on a small knoll north of Little Cypress Bayou. It was used by pioneers traveling from Missouri to Texas on the Southwest Trail or Old Military Road.
Born and raised in a neighboring community, Sam Holloway, vice president of the White County Historical Society, has known about the cemetery since the early 50s. "Everybody knew it was here," he said.
Four rows of graves were marked with rocks and handmade bricks shaded by several oak trees whose dense shade prevented underbrush from covering the grave markers.
Holloway estimates there are about 30 graves in the cemetery. He detects a grave by "witching" for bodies in the ground. The same principle as dowsing, or water witching, using two L-shaped, metal rods to detect a disturbance in the ground through earth radiation.
It is believed that William Killough is buried in this cemetery. Killough died in 1874. According to census records, Killough and his wife Elizabeth moved to the area in the 1850s. Some of their descendants still live in the area.
The White County Historical Society and Arkansas Archeological Survey recognized the cemetery as a historical site in 2005.
Records are available online and several newspapers have written articles about it, Holloway said.
The cemetery is located approximately 1.5 miles off Highway 64 on a farm owned by Jimmy Austin. Austin bought the land in 1971, and discovered the cemetery soon thereafter.
The Lonoke-White Public Water Authority has commissioned a $50 million project to lay 72 miles of pipeline from the Cove Creek intake and treatment plant at Greers Ferry Lake to as far as Furlow bringing much needed water to towns in White and Lonoke Counties.
Woody Bryant, project manager for the water authority, met with the landowner and was made aware of the cemetery in February 2012. Austin was assured the cemetery would not be disturbed.
In August 2012, Bond Engineering, Inc. designed the site plans for the waterline with the historic cemetery in mind.
Paladino Construction of Conway, called Austin in October 2012 and told him they would start construction on his property in two weeks, and they would call him before crossing his property line.
Mid-October of 2012, Austin was on the other side of his property feeding his cows when he heard a commotion. When he arrived at the cemetery's location, he discovered all the trees, bricks and rocks had been removed, the knoll had been leveled and the water line had been installed through the center of the cemetery.
"I was out on my land and I thought I heard some machinery, so i went out there and they had dug about 100 yards past the cemetery," he said.
Once Paladino Construction was informed they had destroyed a historic cemetery, they returned two days later to dig the water line back up, and construct it around the cemetery.
"It cost several thousand, but I made that call that day that it didn't need to be left there," Bryant said. "It's a cost that we all have to pay for."
The project is being funded through a $24.5 million federal loan from the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Development and up to $30.9 million from the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission.
Loans will be repaid through water rates charged by members of the Lonoke-White Public Water Authority.
Scott Akridge, past president of the Arkansas Archeological Society, said there are lots of cemeteries in the surrounding counties, and this could very easily happen again.
"Recording them on state sites is supposed to protect them against projects using federal money," he said.
Bryant said the miscommunication occurred because property lines weren't where they thought they were. The cemetery was identified on the opposite side of the property line on the map that was used to determine the water line's location, he said.
"If there is a historical site it needs to be identified with historical markers," he said. "It shows up in some drawings but there was nothing at the site."
Holloway put a sign up about ten years ago, but deer hunters shot it down.
"They have no respect," Holloway said.
Upon the desecration of Little Cypress Cemetery, Akridge went to survey the area for evidence of human skeletal remains and casket hardware such as nails.
"We could not find any bone or casket hardware anywhere," Akridge said. "Either they missed it, or the acidic nature of the soil dissolved what was there."
Holloway said the construction crew could have dug between a row of graves.
State Archeologist Ann Early said in the absence of hardware or bone, there was no evidence of desecrating burial grounds, a class D felony on the first offense and a class C felony on the second, so no legal action was taken.
The county judge said the only legal action that could be taken at this point is a lawsuit filed by the landowner.
"It's my opinion when you see 15 to 20 rocks sticking upright, it's a clue, but these guys claim they didn't have a clue," Akridge said.
Bryant said if it weren't for the landowners claims or maps showing a historical cemetery, you'd think the rocks and bricks were the remains of an old house.
Paladino Construction recovered what grave markers they could, but the bricks broke apart during construction and could not be salvaged. The majority of the stones were saved.
Holloway wants Paladino Construction to bring the ground up to grade, plant some grass and put something across the road to block traffic on both sides.
Deer hunters are now using the cleared area from the pipeline as a dirt path.
"There's no reason for people to walk across a cemetery," Holloway said.
Bryant said the water authority has done all it can to restore the cemetery, pointing out that there's no access to it as it is a mile from the nearest road.
"We've put up fences in some areas to slow [hunters] down," he said.
Holloway said Paladino Construction made a verbal commitment to bring up the knoll the day they moved the pipeline, but they have yet to bring in enough dirt.
"If they will come back, I'll put the stones back because I'm the only one who knows about where they're at," he said.
The water authority has five miles of waterline to lay before that stage of the project is complete.
"We're certainly sorry it happened, but the benefit is to everyone in central Arkansas," Bryant said. "It's a dual source for most of us to make sure we have water for a long time."

Russell T Davies has returned to the Whoniverse – in book form.

The former executive producer has illustrated a collection of poems about Doctor Who called Now We Are Six A Hundred, written by James Goss.
Goss has previously penned several Torchwood and Doctor Who novels and companion books.
Speaking about the collaboration, Davies said: “I've been drawing for Doctor Who long before I was writing it, so it was like time-travel for me, voyaging back to that young scribbler who used to cover his school desk with Daleks!”
Meanwhile, Goss added: “BBC Books have carefully baited an irresistible trap to lure people into reading poetry.
“Russell's beautiful illustrations make this the most charming Doctor Who book there's ever been (and I'm including that magical first Doctor Who book you discovered as a child).

“The poems have been a delight to work on. Who could resist retelling the fiendish Daleks' Masterplan in verse, or finding bizarre and ludicrous rhymes for monster names?”

Two half-brothers who were convicted in the 1983 rape and murder of an 11-year-old North Carolina girl were ordered free Tuesday, after a judge ruled that they had been wrongly imprisoned thanks to newly discovered DNA evidence.
North Carolina Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser overturned the convictions of death-row inmate Henry Lee McCollum, 50, and Leon Brown, 46, who had been serving a life sentence. Both men originally confessed to the rape and murder of Sabrina Buie, who was found dead in a soybean field in rural North Carolina.
The ruling comes after an investigation by the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission that found no DNA evidence at the crime scene that could be traced back to McCollum or Brown.

But a cigarette found and tested in 2010 contained the DNA of another man, Roscoe Artis, who lived a block away from where the crime took place and is serving a life sentence for another murder and rape within weeks of Buie's death.
“It's impossible to put into words what these men have been through and how much they have lost,” said Ken Rose, a lawyer who represents McCollum, in a statement.
McCollum and Brown, both mentally challenged, initially signed statements saying they were responsible for Buie's death. According to Brown's defense lawyers, the two signed the statements believing they would go home afterward.
“When Henry gave his confession, he got up to walk out of the interrogation room,” says W. James Payne, a lawyer representing Brown. “He started to walk out the door.”
Both appealed their convictions over the years. In 2006, Brown filed a motion to test the DNA of a cigarette butt found at the crime scene. The results eventually excluded both McCollum and Brown. Several years later, the state's innocence commission got involved and in July announced that DNA on the cigarette butt actually belonged to Artis.
That led to the scene Tuesday, in which Judge Sasser announced that the convictions for both men were to be overturned.
“I think I was crying harder than Leon,” says Ann Kirby, one of Brown's lawyers. “To hear the word innocent in a courtroom is the pinnacle for any lawyer. It was history making.”
Both men had been imprisoned for three decades, McCollum being the longest-serving inmate on death row in North Carolina. Brown was on death row for five years until a retrial dismissed his murder charge.
“He always said, ‘They can go to the North Pole, and they're not going to find anything,'” Kirby says, referring to Brown. “When we heard the verdict, we said, ‘They went to the North Pole.' And he said, ‘They sure did.'”

The signings of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl made a statement to front offices around the NHL: Get your pocketbooks ready.
Related: Oilers sign Draisaitl to 8-year, $68M extension
This summer, the Edmonton Oilers committed to dishing out $168 million to lock down their two franchise players for the foreseeable future.
Regardless of the price tags, inking two forwards of Draisaitl's and McDavid's caliber is a huge win for Edmonton and general manager Peter Chiarelli - one that also has major implications for the rest of the league.
Related: Oilers sign McDavid to 8-year extension worth $100M
The Oilers' young guns are among several high-flying duos making a mark on today's NHL, and their respective high-priced contracts will impact future deals for other up-and-coming players.
Here's a look at four-star pairings who could get paid in similar fashion by their clubs.
Winnipeg Jets - Patrik Laine & Nikolaj Ehlers
With an elite sniper like Laine, it's easy to understand how some people can forget about Ehlers.
But the former ninth overall pick is no slouch, notching 25 goals and 39 assists in his first full season with the Jets (his 2015-16 campaign was cut short by injury).
Combined, Laine and Ehlers racked up 61 goals while playing important roles on the Jets' top power-play unit. Along with Mark Scheifele, Ehlers and Laine form a potent scoring attack few teams in the NHL can rival.
Both wingers are still on their entry-level contracts, so expect Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff to have that Brink's truck on speed dial. Laine and Ehlers are worth the price of admission and deserve to get paid for it.
Columbus Blue Jackets - Zach Werenski & Alexander Wennberg

The Blue Jackets were handily dealt with by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of this year's playoffs. However, due to guys like Wennberg and Werenski, first-round exits won't be a common trend.
Wennberg may be the lesser-known name, but the former first-round pick has increased his point total by nearly 20 in each season following his rookie campaign.
Werenski, on the other hand, has received plenty of praise for last season's performance. He finished with 47 points and a plus-17 rating while logging 20:55 of ice time per game.
If not for a few other stud rookies on this list, those numbers would have earned Werenski the 2016-17 Calder Trophy. There's no need to stress over it, though, as he - and Wennberg - should be earning cash hand over fist in the very near future.
Toronto Maple Leafs - Auston Matthews & William Nylander
In a short span, the Maple Leafs have gone from pretenders to contenders, and a lot of that has to do with the play of two rookies that are set for major paydays.

Matthews' quality and worth is obvious. He has elite scoring ability and a well-rounded, two-way game that seemingly gets more effective with every shift. Meanwhile, Nylander combines silky-smooth passing ability with a nose for the net, and managed to total 61 points last season.
Nylander comes off his entry-level deal at the end of the 2017-18 campaign, while Matthews has two years remaining on his rookie contract.
Both forwards are crucial to the future success of the Leafs and will be compensated as such.
Carolina Hurricanes - Sebastian Aho & Jeff Skinner
Aho finished last season with the fourth-most points by a rookie and Skinner buried 37 goals - good enough for sixth-best in the league.
This criminally underrated and offensively dangerous duo will be counted on to bring the Hurricanes back to the playoffs for the first time since 2009.
(Photo courtesy: Getty Images)
Skinner's already attached to a substantial cap hit of $5.725 million, but that number seems low considering his age (25) and ability to rack up goals.
Much like the Leafs, Carolina is no longer a pushover thanks in large part to the club's solid young core. As the Hurricanes' place in the standings rises, look for their payroll to climb along with it.
In-depth: Inside rebel-controlled East Aleppo, we meet people living and loving their city, despite the ever-present threat to life and limb on the Syrian battlefront.
Amr al-Jabali lives in the Ashar neighbourhood of rebel-controlled East Aleppo. The 54-year-old is a painter and builder, and while there is plenty here which needs rebuilding and decoration, he doesn't get much paid work these days.
He does, however, brave the bombs, the price hikes, and the electricity cuts of daily life in this part of the city, described by the UN as a "humanitarian catastrophe".
But al-Jabali won't leave. "I've never left Aleppo in my life, and by the grace of God I won't ever leave," he told The New Arab.
As many as 275,000 people remain in East Aleppo. They stay out of attachment to their homes, an inability to leave safely, for political reasons and others. These are the stories of a few of those who refuse to leave.
Al-Jabali is simply too attached to Aleppo, and has lived here since he was born more than a half century ago. Despite the current hardships, he even has hope for the future.

"We will pick ourselves up and make Aleppo one again, not east, not west," he said. "For that, I stay in Syria."
Nothing short of a life-threatening medical situation could make him leave. "Maybe I'd go to Turkey for emergency medical care like a lot of my neighbours and friends did," said al-Jabali.
There's nothing that could prompt me and my family to leave the city
And al-Jabali isn't alone. Leaving is difficult financially, and some stay for this reason. "I've lived here a long time, and I can't bear the burden of changing houses or travelling," said Khalid Ghazal.
And Ghazal is attached to his war-torn city, too. "There's nothing that could prompt me and my family to leave the city," he said. "Difficulty of living - no matter how powerful - can be manageable."
[Click to enlarge]
There are myriad reasons why people choose to stay here.
Some participated in opposition political activities amid the first sparks of the revolution in 2011, and fear of retribution at the hands of the regime if they were to enter areas under their control keeps them confined to rebel-held districts.
Physically leaving can also prove to be either impossible or as dangerous as living in the city itself.
At the height of the regime siege of the city's east in July and August, there were reports that rebel groups blocked civilians from leaving, citing security concerns. Others feared for their safety - leaving via corridors set up by the regime.
Even for those who have managed to leave Syria's pre-war largest city, life is no walk in the park. Many works illegally in host countries such as Turkey, and face further violence, economic struggles and other the hardships of displacement.
I went to Turkey a year ago, but came back because I couldn't find work
Some of these issues were enough to force Yusuf al-Jamal to leave Turkey and return to Aleppo, despite the war still raging in his hometown.
"I went to Turkey a year ago, but came back because I couldn't find work," he told The New Arab.

on East Aleppo's marketplace
More than 2.7 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey, but al-Jamal actually missed Aleppo while there.
"Because of the psychological pressure and the difficult conditions of exile, I couldn't take it," said al-Jamal, who now sells men's clothing in the al-Fardous neighbourhood.
Al-Jamal returned to his life in East Aleppo, but his family is stuck in the regime-controlled West, and he says he hasn't seen them in more than five years. West Aleppo is under siege by rebel groups, although it's safer than the east. But al-Jamal won't join his family, fearing he'll swiftly be drafted into the Syrian army.
Instead, he passes his days at the store: "Sales are low. The bombings and planes and the siege made it so there isn't a lot of people in the streets." Still, al-Jamal won't leave.
"I don't care about the bombings," he added. "I'm not compelled to leave."

Real Steel: Short Sword
The many types of short swords have origins from almost everywhere in the old world. Indonesia has an amazing variety of big knives and short swords. The Indian region and Africa offer some of the more unusual types. Asia has a number of entries into the category, while Europe offers the small sword and the gladius, among others.
I think the gladius is probably the closest thing to what we, as gamers, think of as a short sword: the classic old-school thief's weapon, designed for fast cut-and-thrust melee in tight spaces.
The sword I'm about to present to you is a hybrid of several types, with some unusual design modifications.
It's Short, but Heavy
My intention was to forge a cut-and-thrust short sword, but one that is heavier-bladed and designed for bigger hits, while maintaining the ability to thrust. I needed to first choose the type of steel best suited to the job, then design the blade profile and edge geometry.
Choice of Steel
First things first. And the first thing that has to be decided is what type of steel is the best choice for the design and its intended purpose. You'll recall from Real Steel: Steel Types and Properties that there are many types of steel, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Since I wanted this to be a hard hitter, my choice is 5160. It's capable of a combination of hardness and toughness that's hard to match. I often choose this steel for choppers, swords, hatchets, and axes.
Blade Profile
The blade profile is the shape of the blade as seen from the side. I wanted a heavy, chopping blade capable of taking a lot of abuse. I went with a slight curve, so that it can chop and slash, and a point, but not so acute that the tip is fragile. This sword is essentially a hybrid seax/cutlass.
Blade Geometry
We went into some depth about geometry in Real Steel: Edge Geometry, so I won't go over all of it again here. The best choice of geometry for a blade expected to hold up when smashing armor is convex. The convex edge isn't capable of great sharpness, but is backed by a lot of steel and is damage resistant. I didn't cover one aspect of blade geometry in that previous Real Steel, so let's talk about it now: distal taper. A well-balanced, light, and fast-handling blade will often have a taper running from just atop the guard to the tip. If it's a full tang, it may also taper from the same spot to the base of the tang. This leaves the thickest part of the blade at or near the ricasso. In a forged blade, it's fairly easy to create a distal taper as part of the forging process. In fact, it's hard to not do it. If the blade is made by grinding, the taper has to deliberately be made. This sword doesn't have much of a taper because I wanted it to be blade heavy and very strong, rather than light and fast. See the compromises? There are always compromises.
The Hilt
I'm not sure if we've talked about the term “hilt” before. Many people think it means “grip,” but in fact it's everything from the guard down. So it's the guard, the grip, and the pommel. This sword has a cold blued, mild steel guard that was fabricated from four pieces that were MIG welded to each other and to the tang. The full tang handle has a leather overlay and cotton cord wrap. The pommel consists of two pieces of cold blued, mild steel that are also MIG welded to the tang.
The Sheath
The sheath is made from white oak. It is intended for safe storage rather than carry, and it has a rare earth magnet for retention. The Elder Futhark runes in the leather say “Foe Hammer” (I can't help it. I'm a geek.).
As always, I'm here for questions and comments.
Randi Weingarten '80 returned to Ithaca on Saturday to discuss the same topic she studied as a student in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations: unionization.
As the president of the American Federation of Teachers — the national union affiliated with Cornell Graduate Students United — Weingarten praised Cornell graduate workers and urged them to vote for unionization on Monday and Tuesday.
In an address to graduate students gathered at Hasbrouck Community Center, Weingarten assured the group that the AFT would not try to diminish local autonomy. Instead, she said, it would be a group that would support graduates if they needed it.
Weingarten highlighted the diversity of locals that are affiliated with the AFT. She said the 3,500 locals “are as different as they can be,” and pointed out that the AFT is still growing, especially since the election of President Donald Trump.
She said that when the first travel ban was announced, she and her partner went to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City to protest with hundreds of others.
While on her way, she said she got a call saying that a professor at CUNY — who belonged to a union affiliated with the AFT — was unable to enter the United States because of the ban.
Through working with a variety of people including U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the professor was able to come home, an event which Weingarten said was an example of the union having someone's back.
“If you vote to organize and ratify a union this Monday and Tuesday, you will never, ever, ever, ever see me ever telling you what to do,” Weingarten said. “What you will see is a union throughout this country who will have your back every single day, for the issues that you champion, for the people that you represent and for the country that we want to be.”
“That is who a union is these days. That is who a union needs to be these days. That is what, if you vote for a union, that is what the graduate students/workers at Cornell will be,” she added.
Weingarten then turned to more local issues, and in what she said was “the only political piece I'll say today,” criticized Prof. David Collum, chair of the chemistry department, who sent out an email to his colleagues calling graduate student unionization “an existential risk to Cornell's graduate program.”
“Look, I went to this school. I went to the school of labor relations at this University. So personally I am really offended that somebody who has a lot of power, and who has tenure and who has voice would actually say in a university that has an ILR school here, that having real labor relations is an existential threat,” Weingarten said.
“Don't tell me that they're an existential threat when we have on this campus, and what makes this campus a great campus, what makes it a land-grant university is having an ILR school,” she continued to applause.
In an interview with The Sun, Weingarten highlighted CGSU's position as what she called a bottom-up organization and criticized Cornell's administration for its behavior during the campaign.
“This is not top-down,” she said of the unionization campaign. “When the boss tries to make it that way, that is the boss attempting — whether the boss is a university president or whether the boss is the head of Walmart — it is the boss trying to create fear and polarize in the same kind of way as Donald Trump tries to polarize.”
Weingarten also condemned what she called a “whispering campaign” whose effects she said she saw even since she arrived earlier that morning.
Earlier several graduate students spoke about their struggles with having kids as a reason for their support for CGSU.
They spoke about the “exorbitant” cost of childcare in Ithaca and pointed out that even though at times things might be alright, a union is necessary for when things go wrong.
“What I've experienced with fellow grads and friends who are nervous about unionization is this notion that ‘well we're okay already,'” said Anaar Desai-Stephens, grad, with her child in her arms. “But sometimes that falls through, that relying on these individual links with our advisors, our departments is really tenuous at best.”
She added that many changes around campus that benefited her, such as the ability to pump on campus, were things that happened because of collective advocacy around campus.
“Asking for a union is not a sign of our privilege, it's a sign of our solidarity,” Desai-Stephens said.
Jane Glaubman, grad, thanked Weingarten and praised the relationship between CGSU and the AFT.
“They always say the union is an outside force coming in,” she said. “Our union was inside people, it was grad students who started a union, but we needed help, and AFT came through and they've done a fantastic job.”
He is also a badass. Facts confirming this are in evidence, following Painter's appearance on the MSNBC show Morning Joy this past weekend.
Painter, who served as legal ethics attorney to then-president George W. Bush, has turned into a relentless critic of President Donald Trump, whom he's blasted for numerous ethical shortfalls, including Trump's unwillingness to sever his business ties while in office.
Painter has turned his attention to this past weekend's "Unite the Right" chaos in Charlottesville, Virginia, which saw violent clashes between alt-right nationalists and leftists. Dozens were injured in fights, and 19 people were injured and one killed after a right-wing activist deliberately drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.
Having previously unleashed plenty of devastating attacks on Trump's behavior in office, now's no time for Painter to stop. The right/white-wing rally in Charlottesville is "very similar to what happend in the streets of Germany in the early 1930s," Painter began.
He continued:
" I've been a Republican for 30 years, but we are the party of Abraham Lincoln, George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan. We are not the party of fascism in America, and we are going to have to reject this. We need to demand today that President Trump fire Sebastian Gorka, Steve Bannon, all the other alt-right neo-fascists in his White House. This is Breitbart News, what you are watching on the streets of Charlottesville, and I as a Republican -- I will remain a Republican, but I will not support fascism. And I will call for the impeachment of this president if he does not fire the neo-fascists in his White House immediately."
Gorka, you'll recall, is the Trump national security adviser who last week said the president hadn't condemned the Bloomington mosque bombing because it might have been faked by "the left."
Painter continued that America had "never, ever" heard rhetoric from its president as it regularly does from Donald Trump, who he thinks has fallen under the spell of dangerous influence from Bannon and Gorka.
In another appearance on the same program, Painter talked even tougher. Presented with a clip of Trump adviser Tom Bossert bending over backwards to avoid condeming the people responsible for Charlottesville, Painter went off, saying Trump's adviser is missing "the big picture," which he explained thusly:
"The alt right is coordinating a lot of these people -- we've had Nazi Party for a long time, and the KKK -- but the alt right is bringing a bunch of other people, helping to coordinate on the internet, to raise marches like this. The alt right is a terrorist movement. It's a racist movement, it's a terrorist movement in the United States. It's a serious threat."
Given the president's association with -- and employment of -- leading figures from the alt right, Painter doubts that his Justice Department is up to the task of dealing with fascists. If that proves true, it'll be left to the states to handle. Painter believes his state, for one, is ready for the challenge.
"We're gonna have to rely on our own state governments to protect ourselves. And I can tell you that the alt right people and the Bannon-ites, come on up to Minnesota. We're gonna have our governor call out the National Guard. We're not going to put up with that kind of thing, and I think a lot of other states aren't going to put up with it."
Take it from Richard Painter. Some threats to the republic call for the studied recitation of political and societal norms and legal precedent to make a well-founded Constitutional argument against the actions of one's political opposition. And sometimes you just tell those motherfuckers to bring it on and see what happens.

Rockland County and town of Clarkstown and Orangetown highway crews have been busy this week repairing potholes that vary from several inches deep to a row of one after another that drivers have to maneuver between. A rapid weather cycle of freezing temperatures followed by thawing and rainfall led to potholes quickly forming throughout the county. All three department superintendents urge drivers to notify their offices when they come across potholes.
County Highway Superintendent Charles "Skip" Vezzetti said crews got to work in earnest this week.
"Certainly they're popping up much earlier than usual," said Vezzetti, noting that it has been an early pothole season from the Hudson Valley up to Albany.
He said a portion of Strawtown Road that the New York State Thruway passes over was in bad shape because a lot of utility work was done in the summer but the county did not get the chance to repair the road before the cold weather arrived.
On Wednesday, the department had five crews out repairing potholes and they were working in each of the county's towns. Vezzetti said because the temperature was relatively mild and the rain stopped they were able to use a hot mix which is more permanent than a winter mix which is a cold mix and temporary. Vezzetti expected crews should finish filling potholes on county roads on Friday and said crews typically respond to complaints within 24 hours.
Clarkstown Highway Superintendent Wayne Ballard said this winter has been especially challenging.
"A highway superintendent wants one of two things: a really cold season or a very warm winter," said. "A fluctuating winter with varying temperatures causes the roads to heave and allows water to get into the road and the freeze/thaw pops the asphalt. The more the temperature fluctuates, the more potholes that are going to occur."
Clarkstown also has been using hot mix which Ballard explained enables the blacktop to better adhere to the road.
Orangetown Highway Superintendent Jim Dean said seven crews were working on pothole repairs on Thursday and he expected them to be finished in a day or two. He said crews have already used as much mix this winter as they usually use in an entire season even though Orangetown uses 25 percent less mix than neighboring towns because of its pavement preservation program.
"We're on top of it this time of year," said Dean, who is in his 53rd year working with the department. "Normally we have one or two crews on patrol. We are answering notices we have, starting with main roads, first, the ones with the heaviest traffic flow and impact. We are seeing more than we usually do."
Dean said the town's roads were in pretty good shape despite the weather.
"These weather conditions, in all my time here, this is the most unusual set of circumstances I've seen," said Dean. "We have already had three freeze-thaw cycles and it's the middle of January."
"We don't want to see big holes people will lose a tire or bend a rim in," said Dean. "We don't want people swerving to miss holes and create collisions and don't want them wrecking their vehicles, so we are doing our due diligence and utmost to address any holes there. "
Dean said responding to a pothole report is a priority.
"If a municipality is formally notified there is a dangerous condition and doesn't respond to take care of it, it could be liable for damages," he said.
Vezzetti said potholes are an annual occurrence and should not take anyone by surprise.
"Potholes have been part of our lifestyle for the last 80 years," he said.
To report potholes on county roads call the highway department at 845-638-5060. To report a pothole on a Clarkstown road, call the Clarkstown Highway Department, (845) 623-7500 or email Highway@Clarkstown.org. The Orangetown Highway Department can be reached at 845-359-6500.
Ye olde vampire slaying kit: Victorian oak box complete with wooden stakes, garlic paste and vials of holy water up for auction
Casket contains set of rosary beads, three glass bottles containing holy water, holy earth and garlic, and a book of common prayer dated 1857
Macabre artefact expected to fetch up to £2,000
They say you can never be too prepared... but even for the most superstitious person this may be overkill.
A 19th century Vampire slaying kit, which includes a wooden mallet and four oak stakes, glass vials of holy water and garlic paste is expected to fetch up £2,000 when auctioned later this month.
The macabre artefact also has a percussion cap pistol - invented in the 1830 - and a steel bullet mold, all carefully crafted to offer the best protection against any creatures of the night.
Precautions: The case contains 1) a rosary 2) crucifix 3) a handwritten psalm (Luke 20:27) 4) a pistol 5) four oak stakes 6) a bottle of consecrated earth 7) a common prayer book 8) a wooden mallet 9) silver bullet mold 10) a cloth 11) two glass bottles containing garlic paste and holy water
According to folklore, vampires were vulnerable to a host item able to ward off evil - many of which are stocked in this box.
Legend had it, they were unable to come into contact with sacred items or even walk on consecrated ground - hence the vials of holy water and earth, a crucifix and rosary beads.
One of the most commonly cited method for killing a vampire was driving a wooden stake through its heart or shooting it with a silver or steel bullet.
The box also has a handwritten psalm from Luke 20:24 which reads: 'Bid those mine enemies which would not that I should reign over them bring hither, and slay them before me.'
Despite being created in the late 1890s, the auctioneer says there is no sign of blood on the stakes and the garlic and holy water have never been used.
Oonagh Drage from Tennants Auctioneers said: ‘I would say it's been commissioned by someone, I've never seen anything like it and I've been doing this for more than 30 years.
‘Bram Stoker did Dracula in the 1890s and maybe the idea came from that.
‘There was an interest in vampires and the supernatural at that time - perhaps they were playing with people's superstitions.'
Superstitious: The case dates to the late 19th century when fears of Vampires - portrayed in the cult classic 1968 film Dracula Has Risen From The Grave, starring Veronica Carlson and Christopher Lee, pictured - were at their height
The box was given to the vendor by a rich uncle.
‘I don't know if he really believed in vampires or whether he bought it as a curiosity,' said Oonagh.
‘He collected some very strange objects, I think there were a few weird and wonderful things including many books on the occult. He was a very eccentric man.
‘The vendors have kept one set and sold one for £5,000, and while the one we have was in the best condition it does have a pistol in it and they didn't want that in the house.'
The casket is said to contain a ‘percussion cap pistol with octagonal steel barrel, foliate etched box lock and walnut bag butt,' as well as a steel bullet mould.
There is a set of rosary beads, three glass bottles containing holy water, holy earth and garlic, and a book of common prayer dated 1857.
All are contained in a blue velvet lined mahogany casket and the inner cover is set with a gilt metal and mahogany crucifix, the silver lock ‘escutcheon' in the form of a cross.
It is estimated to sell for between £1,200 and £2,000 and is on display in Harrogate until the sale, which will be in Leyburn, North Yorkshire, on June 22.
Oonagh added: ‘I'm not sure who will buy it as we are yet to put it on the internet. I know there are quite a few Americans who are interested in this kind of thing.
Disgruntled Conservative MPs are threatening to vote against fulfilling the 'vow' for Scottish independence - while the Liberal Democrats are threatening to block a vote on the pledge in the first place.
Right now the turmoil over whether and how to keep the promises made by Westminster's three party leaders to the people of Scotland is being kept firmly behind closed doors.
But frustrations on both sides of the coalition and a deepening split with the Labour party this autumn are steadily reducing the chances of agreement being reached along the lines of the timetable set out before the September 18th 'No' vote.
It might sound like bad news for the Conservatives, but this is actually a win-win scenario for them. Whatever the outcome, it's likely to make Ed Miliband's chances of getting into No 10 as prime minister all the slimmer.
Tory rebels ready to defy Cameron
Emerging evidence of the concerns of suspicious Tory backbenchers - those who are simply not prepared to back Cameron's promise without a comparable deal for England - will be alarming news for the government.
One Conservative MP said: "The deal was done by Gordon Brown without any consultation. In principle I have no problem whatsoever with more devolution for the Scots, but that has to go in tandem with English votes for English laws. The deal has to be done together, not one then the other. What is sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander."
'In tandem' is an unfortunate phrase. It was first uttered by the prime minister on the morning of September 19th and implied that Scottish devolution could not take place without devolution for the rest of the UK.
That is exactly what Cameron meant. But it was an awkward choice of words, and in the following days the Conservatives realised a standoff over the English question risked the pledge to Scottish voters sliding. Unfortunately that is exactly what now looks like happening.
Senior Tories also realised there was great potential to politicise the issue. So, by U-turning, Downing Street isolated Miliband as the only party leader opposing English votes for English laws.
That has allowed Labour to be painted as the party letting down 85% of the population. Never mind that the opposition has unveiled an impressive-looking package of devolution. "English votes for English laws is not about devolution," as one source close to the Labour leader put it. "It's about the mechanics of this place for the political advantage of the Conservative party, even if it breaks up the United Kingdom."
Labour has steered clear of the cross-party talks being held on English devolution in a sub-committee of the Cabinet chaired by William Hague. That means the leader of the House's proposal to hold a Commons vote on the issue if a deal is not reached by the end of November is very much a live one.
The division, if it actually happens, is set for either side of Christmas. And the Tories are upbeat. If it came to it, Conservative strategists remain optimistic they could win a Commons vote even in the face of united opposition from Labour and the Lib Dems.
Persuading a handful of frustrated Labour backbenchers to rebel is always going to be difficult, however, and the suspicion of the Tories' partisan motives that unites Labour and the Lib Dems will probably be strong enough to block them.
Now the negative noises being sounded by some Tory MPs is making such a Conservative victory even more unlikely.
One former minister said the idea an English deal could be reached in keeping with the Scottish timetable was "ridiculous" and that he intended to rebel over the vow as a result.
"I will be voting against further devolution for Scotland as promised by Gordon Brown and signed up to by the leader of my party," he told Politics.co.uk.
"He [Cameron] had no mandate so I don't feel bound to support that idea. I wasn't elected on that proposition."
When asked whether he thought other Tory MPs would join him, the ex-minister added: "I'd be very surprised if there weren't. There was considerable disquiet at the prime minister's decision to get Gordon Brown to announce a new policy when it's specifically not been negotiated out of the options available to the Scottish people in their referendum. The PM felt it was necessary to save the union. That was his judgement, not mine - but then again, I'd probably put rather less store by the union than he does."
The message of these MPs to William Hague is simple. Don't expect their support for devo-max until it's clear it represents a fair financial deal to constituents in England - and that the English votes for English laws question has been settled for good.
A Lib Dem spanner in the works
There is a further problem faced by Hague and Cameron: the risk that agreement with the Lib Dems could prove equally elusive.
The initial deadlock was over the makeup of a grand committee of English-only MPs put forward by the Lib Dems.
The coalition's junior party has been arguing that proportional representation is how the elected assemblies of the devolved institutions are chosen; the Tories respond by saying they refuse to accept any reduction in their influence in the Commons.
David Laws brings the LibDems to the English Question, with an argument for EVEL(PR) http://t.co/u4wMKdcZh2 via @guardian — Sunder Katwala (@sundersays) October 2, 2014
Despite the initial deadlock a deal might still be possible. As Politics.co.uk reported earlier this week, the Lib Dems could be prepared to give way if the Conservatives accept a big idea known as 'democracy on demand'.
The stakes are high for the Tories. If they accept the Lib Dem proposals power could leak out of Whitehall like a sieve. If they refuse, it's now emerged, the Lib Dems are threatening to block Hague's cherished vote on the issue.
A motion of the kind Hague wants would have to be put forward by the government. It would be impossible if the Lib Dems, frustrated by the talks, chose not to play ball. As one source put it: "Why would we agree to a motion when there's no cross-party agreement?"
An impasse with the Liberals would force the Tories to resort to asking helpful Conservative MPs to seek a vote in the sliver of Commons time controlled by backbenchers.
Such a move would only make already-strained coalition relations frostier after the parties blocked each other's bids to legislate for an EU referendum and dilute the impact of the bedroom tax last month.
Bad news for Ed
Of course the party leaders need time to secure consensus. Their problem is they have very little of it.
In Westminster the coalition's secret talks, backbench mutterings and Labour suspicions are set to continue all the way up to the vote which may, or may not, actually happen.
Right now none of the three main parties are in agreement. This opens up the possibility that nationalists will be given free rein to protest the timetable for the Scottish vow is not being upheld.
Such an outcome would not be so bad for the Tories.
Anger with the Westminster parties would only serve to help the cause of SNP candidates taking on Labour north of the border.
The nationalists can point to Brown's promise of a second reading bill before the general election as proof that the English can't deliver what they promised.

The Conservatives will argue that was never part of the deal and insist they only need to produce a draft bill before May next year.
It's an approach that won't put off Tory voters in their English constituencies, but will strengthen the hand of the nationalists in Scotland.
The SNP is looking to make substantial gains in 2015. These will come at the expense of Labour, further diminishing Miliband's chances of ending up in Downing Street.

Danny Kanell has made it no secret he thinks the sport of football is becoming weaker by the day. Kanell spits in the face at times of what he perceives to be a war on football any time the topic of CTE issues in the game are brought up. The former Florida State and NFL quarterback has been through the rigors of the football world on levels many of us could only dream of, so his opinions are not without a first-hand experience to fall back on, however it is fair to suggest Kanell sometimes goes a little bit too far to one extreme when it comes to the game's physical elements in today's more modern world.
On Friday, Kanell was discussing the AFC Championship Game between the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots with his ESPN Radio co-host Ryan Rusillo. While discussing Von Miller's potential impact on the game (keep in mind Miller's previous trolling of Brady), as well as the entire Broncos defense, Kanell suggested it might be a good strategy to have some defenders get some early licks in on Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, even if it meant drawing a penalty flag after the whistle. You know, to send the four-time Super Bowl champion quarterback a message.
“I didn't even think about this until just now. I think they have to have two personal foul calls, like 15-yarders against Brady. Like, they've been talking about him crying, I almost feel like this is the type of game where you have to send a message like in the first and second quarter, the first half, hit him a couple of times where it's a little past the whistle. Like, let him know you're around. Get those knock downs, get those hits on him, make him aware that you're coming after him.” “I'm saying you're gonna take the hit, you're going to hit him late and you're going to get a flag called on you for hitting him late… It's one of those games where you're like in the first half, you know what, if it's close and you get a good… I'm not saying dirty, but questionable.” “You gotta push the envelope. I would almost challenge them to like be like ‘You know what, get a 15-yarder in the first half. Draw a line somewhere, but say ‘We have to send a message.'”
At one point in that thought process Rusillo checked in to clarify what Kanell was saying, but Rusillo later went on to suggest Kanell's statement made sense. You can listen to a clip of the audio below.
There are ways to send messages in the sport of football, and indeed sometimes there may be a reason to take a moderate cheap shot if the opportunity presents itself. However, no team playing for a trip to the Super Bowl against a quarterback as battle-tested as Brady should ever go so far as to design a couple of opportunities to draw an unsportsmanlike or roughing the passer penalty, because great quarterbacks take advantage of 15, or 30 extra free yards. Those yards can mean the difference between seven, three or zero points on any given possession, so taking a penalty simply for the intent of sending a message to Brady seems a bit foolish in the grand scheme of things.
Kanell did clarify he was not suggesting the Broncos put a hit on Brady to take him out, which is supported by his idea of “draw a line somewhere” and fall on whatever side of that line that is not intentionally taking out Brady. New England, of course, may be a tad sensitive when it comes to talk about players aiming to take cheap shots on their players given the recent idea that players in the NFL were aiming at Rob Gronkowski's knees.
Of course, as it has been noted by many over the past few days, Brady's history in Denver is not all that rosy. In eight-lifetime game sin the Mile High City, Brady was beaten just two Denver quarterbacks. One was Tim Tebow. The other? You guessed it. Kanell.
Tom Brady is 2-6 lifetime in Denver. The 2 wins were over Danny Kanell (2003) and Tim Tebow (2011) #Patriots #CmonMan @DPostSports @Broncos — Michael Seff (@DraftAmerica) January 21, 2016

Hunt told MyBroadband the leaked database is a 27.2GB backup file that he found available as a torrent some time ago. He imported the backup and gained 31.6 million records before it crashed.
Hunt said that one record was only 594 characters. Assuming an average record length of 600 bytes, that means there could be over 47 million records in the database.
Legitimate
Hunt queried the data of people who granted permission for him to do so, and the results looked legitimate.
However, it appears the data might be compiled from multiple sources. Address, income, living standard measure, contact, and employment information seem to be more current than the title deed data.
It is not clear where the data originated from, or who leaked it.
The backup file was last modified in March 2017, giving a possible date the breach took place. Hunt noted it could have happened earlier, however, as the data dates back to the early 1990s.
The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform has a website through which title deed data may be queried called DeedsWeb.
MyBroadband has contacted the Chief Registrar of Deeds and the State Information Technology Agency for comment.
London (CNN) Queen Elizabeth II paid tribute to the victims of the Manchester terror attack and the Grenfell Tower fire in London during her annual Christmas Day message Monday.
Speaking from Buckingham Palace in a recorded address, she told of the "privilege" of meeting those injured in the Manchester attack that killed 22 people attending an Ariana Grande concert.
Queen Elizabeth II speaks to Millie Robson, 15, and her mother, Marie, during a hospital visit to meet victims of the terror attack in Manchester.
She also commended the country's emergency services, which have endured a difficult year with a series of terror attacks in London.
The Queen also spoke about those who lost family members in the Grenfell Tower fire in which 71 people perished
People sit outside near the arena. The crowd was made up of mainly younger people who had come to see Grande in her first of three scheduled concerts in the UK.

People in Manchester, England, gather in St. Ann's Square on Thursday, May 25. They were observing a national minute of silence to remember the victims of a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert.
"For many, the idea of 'home' reaches beyond a physical building -- to a hometown or city," she said in her televised address.
"This Christmas, I think of London and Manchester, whose powerful identities shone through over the past 12 months in the face of appalling attacks. In Manchester, those targeted included children who had gone to see their favorite singer. A few days after the bombing, I had the privilege of meeting some of the young survivors and their parents.
Queen Elizabeth II leaves the Christmas Day morning service at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham.
"I describe that hospital visit as a privilege because the patients I met were an example to us all, showing extraordinary bravery and resilience. Indeed, many of those who survived the attack came together just days later for a benefit concert. It was a powerful reclaiming of the ground, and of the city those young people call home."
Difficult year
The UK has been hit by a number of terror attacks over the past year with three of those targeting London.

In March, a terrorist plowed his vehicle into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, killing four people, before stabbing a police officer to death outside Parliament.
In June, a vehicle and knife attack left eight people dead in the London Bridge area of the capital.
Later that month, one man died and nine people were hospitalized after a terrorist attack targeting London's Muslim community.
In Manchester, 22 were killed and 60 injured during May's suicide bomb attack on the city's concert hall.
The Queen also spoke of her pain of the tragedy of Grenfell Tower, as well as those who lost their homes and loved ones in Hurricanes Irma and Maria.

"We expect our homes to be a place of safety -- sanctuary even -- which makes it all the more shocking when the comfort they provide is shattered," she said.
"A few weeks ago, the Prince of Wales visited the Caribbean in the aftermath of hurricanes that destroyed entire communities. And here in London, who can forget the sheer awfulness of the Grenfell Tower fire?
"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who died and those who lost so much; and we are indebted to members of the emergency services who risked their own lives, this past year, saving others. Many of them, of course, will not be at home today because they are working, to protect us."
70th anniversary
The Queen also took the opportunity to speak of her 70 years of marriage to Prince Philip, and his decision to retire from public engagements.

She said that events of the past year made her "grateful for the blessings of home and family, and in particular for 70 years of marriage."
And she hinted at the arrival of new family members, with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry planning to marry in May, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting their third child in April.
Britain's Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, has retired from public engagements.
"I don't know that anyone had invented the term 'platinum' for a 70th wedding anniversary when I was born," she said.
"You weren't expected to be around that long. Even Prince Philip has decided it's time to slow down a little -- having, as he economically put it, 'done his bit.'
"But I know his support and unique sense of humor will remain as strong as ever, as we enjoy spending time this Christmas with our family and look forward to welcoming new members into it next year."
Fifteen Black Entrepreneurs Make a Big Deposit In A Black-Owned Bank
By Robert Stitt
Fifteen young Black businessmen entered the Black-owned Industrial Bank with the intent of opening accounts. The men were members of the Black Male Entrepreneurship Institute (BMEI), a partner of the U.S. Black Chambers Inc. (USBC). The move was a calculated effort to gain support for black-on-black economics.
Ron Busby is CEO of the USBC. He said, “In order for there to be a strong Black America, you must have strong Black businesses. In order for there to be strong Black businesses, we must have strong Black banks. So, from my standpoint, this is just a reciprocation for what Industrial Bank has done for our communities for the last 80 years.”
The President/CEO of the Industrial Bank, Doyle Mitchell, was on hand and congratulated Busby for his leadership and inspiration to the young men. “I'm just humbled at the presence of mind that you have displayed since you first came to town and started taking a leadership role with the Chamber of Commerce and came to Industrial Bank and made a $5,000 deposit. You put your money where your mouth is,” he said.
Busby talked about the changes that happened in his life when he started to focus on Black business. He said that it impacted every area of his life. When it was time to buy a house, he found a Black real estate agent, a Black mortgage company, a Black title company, a Black home inspector, a Black pest control company, and a Black moving company. “Everybody that touched the transaction was a Black firm. The service was superior and the price was right.”
“There's a trillion dollars of spending power in our community and we want to make sure that dollar stays within our community. Twenty-eight days a dollar stays in the Asian community, twenty-one days a dollar stays in the Hispanic community. In our community, our dollar leaves within six hours. We have got to change that…Until we have total control of how we circulate our money, our power and respect will continue to be marginalized,” he declared.
Busby is the leading voice supporting Black banks and businesses in America today. He hopes that he can continue to inspire young Black men and women to support the Black community by investing in themselves and their communities.

Case of Vladimir Rybak is latest in a string of kidnappings which Kiev blames on Russia and its undercover agents
The last time Vladimir Rybak was seen alive was on Thursday 17 April . The local councillor was walking away from the city hall in the eastern Ukrainian city of Horlovka after taking part in a pro-Ukrainian flashmob in the central square. Three days earlier, separatists had seized the government building, taking down the Ukrainian flag and replacing it with the tricolour of the Donetsk People's Republic.
According to friends, Rybak, who was 42, made no secret of his strong anti-separatist views. "He was entirely open – and at times impulsive," fellow councillor Yurii Zhuk said. After the demonstration Rybak tried to barge his way into the Horlovka city hall and take down the rebel flag. A video captured what happened next. Pro-Russian protesters jostled Rybak; they refused to let him inside; a youth in a balaclava grabbed his arm and led him away.
Zhuk said that Rybak and a friend then left the square, tracking away from its Lenin statue, and headed towards the city's Palace of Culture. A Kia car pulled up, and four men in masks and military fatigues jumped out and grabbed him. Rybak's friends assume the kidnappers must have had a gun. "Vladimir was a sportsman and an ex-policeman. He knew how to handle himself," Zhuk said.
Over the weekend, Rybak's battered body was found in a river near the separatist stronghold of Slavyansk, 60 miles away. According to investigators, he had been tortured. There were stab marks on his stomach and bruising on his chest. Rybak's kidnappers tied a sandbag to his body and drowned him while he was unconscious. On Wednesday, his widow Elena, a 49-year-old doctor, and 25-year-old son Yura, went to Slavyansk to retrieve his body.
The gruesome case is the latest in a string of kidnappings and murders in eastern Ukraine which Kiev blames on Russia and its undercover agents. Law and order in Slavyansk and surrounding areas of the Donetsk region has deteriorated dramatically. In Kramatorsk, pro-Russian gunmen hijacked the security agency HQ. They also beat up the city's deputy mayor and kidnapped its police chief – both supporters of Ukrainian unity.
The situation in Slavyansk, the separatists' fortified capital, appears to be one of gun rule. Pro-Russian militias continue to hold an American journalist, Simon Ostrovsky, taken hostage early on Tuesday, as well as several Ukrainian reporters including Irma Krat. The gunmen have threatened western correspondents, evicted Roma families from their homes and apparently imprisoned the local mayor.
Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the "people's mayor" of Slavyansk said that Ostrovsky wasn't a hostage as such but was being "held" by his militia. He described the journalist as a "provocateur" and berated the media for not reporting on the fate of pro-Russian activists arrested by Kiev for separatism. The mayor gave no indication of when Ostrovsky might be released. He said he was being kept in good conditions, with enough to eat, and the opportunity to wash.
In the past week, 16 people have been kidnapped in Slavyansk and Horlovka, and two murdered, including Rybak. Rybak was a deputy for the Batkivshchyna party of Ukraine's acting president, Olexsander Turchynov, who announced on Tuesday that Kiev would now restart military operations against pro-Russian separatists in the east. The body of a second party supporter, unidentified, was found near Rybak's. Both had been tortured to death, Turchynov said.
"The terrorists who effectively took the whole Donetsk region hostage have now gone too far, by starting to torture and murder Ukrainian patriots. These crimes are being committed with the full support and connivance of the Russian Federation," he said on Tuesday.
There were few signs of an offensive on Wednesday, however. Ukraine's interior ministry claimed it had flushed gunmen out of a small town called Svyatogorsk, just outside Slavyansk, but there had been no previous reports of gunmen in the town.
It is unclear if Kiev's latest military operation will be more successful than a similar attempt last week.
That ended in humiliating failure when well-organised pro-Russian gunmen captured six Ukrainian armoured vehicles sent to Kramatorsk, 10 miles from Slavyansk. Either way, it is clear that the international deal to defuse the crisis, agreed last week in Geneva, is dead and buried.
The EU called on Russia on Wednesday to ensure an immediate end to the kidnappings and killings in eastern Ukraine. But Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused Kiev of violating the Geneva statement, and warned that Russia would respond if its interests were attacked in Ukraine.
Lavrov used an interview with the Russian state-controlled broadcaster RT to accuse the US of "running the show" in Ukraine, saying it was quite telling that Kiev announced a new military campaign immediately after a visit by the US vice-president, Joe Biden. "If we are attacked, we would certainly respond," said Lavrov, who recalled the 2008 war with Georgia over breakaway South Ossetia.
In the capital, Kiev, Ukraine's SBU security service revealed details of Russia's alleged role in Rybak's abduction and murder. Officials named two Russian agents as the masterminds behind special operations in the east of Ukraine. Both agents work for Moscow's GRU military intelligence wing, the officials said.
Zhuk said he last saw Rybak in Horlovka's central square half an hour before his abduction. They had agreed to meet at 10am the next day. "That someone can be kidnapped in 2014 in the centre of Europe is terrible. I don't have words," he said.
Who was responsible? "Radical elements who exist in the city. The fact that he was found in Slavyansk confirms this was the work of separatists."
According to Zhuk, the majority of Horlovka – a mining and industrial city of 275,000 people – do not support the separatists' cause. But he said Russian television had had a brainwashing effect, with many people now unable to tell "what was true and what a lie". He stressed: "The big majority are peaceful."
Zhuk described calls for an anti-Kiev referendum on 11 May as completely absurd, saying: "There is no legal basis for it." He is one of three representatives in the 75-seat city assembly for the Europe party.
The police had done little to halt the breakdown in public order, he said. "They are demoralised, and split into two halves: one group supports the Donetsk People's Republic, the other Ukrainian unity. There's no unified leadership. Nor are there any clear orders from Kiev."
He said he had sympathy for young officers, aged 25 or so, who were supposed to deal with angry crowds armed with just a stick.
Rybak was elected to Horlovka's city council in October 2010. A father of two, he had previously worked as a detective, heading up the investigations unit.
Another councillor – Oleg Gurbanov, an independent – said he had disagreed with Rybak over many topics, but respected him for his forthright views. "I absolutely condemn the people who did this. Everybody has a right to life," Gurbanov said.
The Donetsk People's Republic flag still flies above the building, even though normal work resumed last week after the separatists left.
"I want a united Ukraine. But we've left [the flag] up there for now to try and avoid conflict," Vasily Mirozhnik, head of public affairs, explained. Who was behind Rybak's murder? "It's a riddle," he said.
Donald Trump has told Theresa May he wants to revive the close transatlantic bond enjoyed by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.
The controversial US President-elect launched a charm offensive during a ten-minute phone call with the Prime Minister yesterday, telling her Britain is 'a very, very special place for me and our country'.
Mr Trump invited Mrs May to visit him in Washington 'as soon as possible'. And – in a boost for hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal – Downing Street sources said the tycoon also talked of his hope of reviving the close UK-US relationship that dominated the West throughout the 1980s.

'The President-elect made it clear he is keen to have a good personal relationship,' a source said. 'He used the Reagan-Thatcher relationship as his reference point.'
The apparent warmth of the call spared Downing Street's blushes after it emerged Mr Trump had called nine other world leaders, including those of Egypt, Ireland and Australia, before speaking to Mrs May.
As the reverberations of Mr Trump's unlikely victory continued to spread around the world yesterday:
■A former Nato chief warned that his triumph could spark the 'beginning of the end' for the transatlantic security pact that has kept the peace for decades, unless he uses his first 100 days to show he is willing to stand up to Russia;
■China warned Mr Trump against sparking a trade war that would damage the world economy. His threat to impose stiff tariffs prompted threats of 'countermeasures' by Beijing;

■Mr Trump and Barack Obama posed awkwardly for the cameras after talks at the White House. Officials were forced to deny that Michelle Obama had cancelled the traditional photograph of the first family and their successors;
■Demonstrations against Mr Trump broke out in cities across the US, with protesters chanting 'not my president'.
■Britain moved to exploit European divisions over Mr Trump by seeking to build early relationships with the new regime. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told EU leaders it was 'time to snap out of the doom and gloom'.
Whitehall initially appeared to be caught flat-footed by Mr Trump's victory, and faced embarrassment after it emerged that a string of world leaders had beaten Mrs May ito speak to the man now heading for the White House.
Chancellor Philip Hammond defended the delay, saying the two leaders had 'no urgent business' to discuss. Downing Street insiders insisted it had simply taken a while to co-ordinate the diaries of the pair.
The President-elect is keen to have a good personal relationship with Mrs May, a source said
THE BOND THAT REALLY WAS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP Ronald Reagan walks with Margaret Thatcher during the G7 Summit in Toronto in 1988 During the Thatcher years, the special relationship between Britain and America was elevated to new heights. Margaret Thatcher's bond with Ronald Reagan was said to have defined her premiership. From the moment they met – in 1975 at the House of Commons when he was governor of California and she was the leader of the Opposition – they bonded and were said to have agreed on almost everything. ‘Mr President' and ‘Madam Prime Minister' were replaced by ‘Dear Ron' and ‘Dear Margaret'. They danced together on a number of state occasions – most famously following a dinner given in her honour at the White House in November 1988. She was Mr Reagan's most prolific correspondent among heads of state and they exchanged hundreds of letters, messages and telephone calls. Reagan's last official act as President of the United States on January 11, 1989, was to sign a letter of thanks and appreciation to Lady Thatcher, then beginning her last two years in Downing Street.
When the call was finally arranged at 1.45pm it was surprisingly warm. No 10 said the two leaders described the UK-US relationship as 'very important and very special'. A spokesman added: 'President-elect Trump set out his close and personal connections with, and warmth for, the UK. He said he was confident the special relationship would go from strength to strength.'
Mrs May 'highlighted her wish to strengthen bilateral trade and investment with the US as we leave the EU'.
She also urged Mr Trump to follow through on his pledge to work to heal the divisions that poisoned a brutal presidential elections campaign.
EU capitals have reacted to Mr Trump's victory with what one Government insider described as a 'collective nervous breakdown'.
The EU has called an emergency summit in Brussels on Sunday to discuss future relations with the US. Senior German politicians have warned the result, coupled with Brexit, could fuel populist revolts across Europe.
But Mr Johnson, who was due to speak to Mr Trump's running mate Mike Pence last night, told EU leaders to calm down, saying: 'It's time we were positive about this. I say to my European colleagues that it is time we snap out of this doom and gloom and whinge-arama.
'He's a deal-maker and we should seize the opportunities.'
Ever since Lil Wayne came home from Rikers and announced he'd taken up skateboarding as a hobby, there was a rash of debate amongst music fans as well as the skateboarding community over whether or not Wayne could actually skate, and if so, if he was any good at it.
Today we're here to present you with eight minutes of video evidence proving that Lil Wayne can indeed skate, and he's actually pretty awesome. While you wouldn't confuse him with a pro, he's a significantly better skater than you or me, and that's damn impressive in and of itself.
We're not giving you some self-promotional puff piece featuring Wayne landing every single trick like he's a character in the next Tony Hawk game—instead, it's a portrait of his evolution as a developing skater, falls, fuckups and all. The thing about Wayne is he's such an inherently magnetic figure that even watching him ride a skateboard from one end of his trukSTOP skatepark to another is completely and utterly hypnotic. And if you watch all the way through, you'll see him ride up a quarter-pipe only to do a stall in front of a bunch of twerking strippers, which is kind of incredible.

It was first spotted in Houston. But then so many strange phenomena are.
Now it's heading your way, regardless of where you might be keeping safe in these excitable United States.
It might seem to you as if it's had a few drinks. But no amount of offering it your Jack or your Bacardi will keep it from one thing it really wants in its mouth.
Yes, your S4, iPhone 5 or, indeed, anything that smacks of electronica.
Nylanderia fulva is its name. But you, at least as far as scientists are concerned, can call it the "crazy ant."
This is to be distinguished from the crazy aunt. She will only start chewing through your DVR cables after she's been at the Bacardi.
As ABC News explains it, we should all be very concerned. These ants used to hang in Argentina and Brazil.
Now they are with us, and they truly are quite crazy. Their path is the kind of meandering mess that the inebriated would eschew. They're only an eighth of an inch long, so you'll hardly see them before it's too late.
Worse, they are terribly fond of crawling into your gadgets and spending the rest of their lives there. They have a particular fondness for laptops, phones, and recreational vehicles.
Yes, they eat them. In fact, they'll try to eat anything.
Researchers at Texas A&M believe they have already caused $146.5 million worth of weeping human eyes at the sight of destroyed gadgets.
More research done at the University of Texas in Austin suggests that these things just can't be stopped so easily. (I have embedded video featuring the University's Edward LeBrun explaining how the ants take their talents to new places.)
You might want to ensure that you are not in possession of any food or drink before I tell you the next part -- the one that may affect your precious Lumia 920.
Ready? Well, infestation starts like this: One crazy ant crawls into your gadget, munches away, and gets electrocuted.
This buzz makes it roll over, wave its belly in the air, and give off an aroma that Estee Lauder would surely love to patent. ("Antidote. The Fragrance That's A Killer!")
You remember that these ants are crazy? Well, they love this scent so much that hordes of them storm toward it.
Soon, more of them are being electrocuted. Which means more of them are giving off the perfume. Which means more of them are heading for your Lumia. Yes, they are Lumiatics.
Ultimately, there are so many dead ants inside your gadget that it enjoys a short circuit or sauteed insulation or one of the other fine things that might happen when you have a million electrocuted ants inside you.
You might imagine that you can use the same precautions against these crazies as you use against the fire ant. Not so. Indeed, the crazies seem to be making the fire ants disappear and don't succumb to any amount of Raid.
All right, they don't bite as meanly as the fire ants and they can't fly. But if they get themselves inside any part of your life they reproduce even more quickly than they eat.
Please be prepared to be very annoyed. These crazy ants fully intend to make you demented.
They can't help themselves. Sadly, it seems that you can't either -- other than to check your gadgets for insane invaders 10 times every day.
Kenya's unity bearing fruit as Sevens rugby coach sets target for national team
Thursday, February 4th 2016 at 00:00 GMT +3 | Thursday, February 4th 2016 at 00:00 GMT +3 | Rugby By Rodgers Eshitemi:

Kenya Sevens rugby head coach Benjamin Ayimba believes a top-five finish is a realistic target in the IRB series.
Shujaa had its worst performance in many years last season when they flirted with relegation for the better part of the season, before eventually finishing 13th with a paltry 46 points.
But Ayimba seems to be turning around their fortunes since his re-appointment as the head tactician. The team is now eighth in the overall World Seven Series standings with 30 points after a fairly impressive start.
Shujaa started off the campaign on a bad note, garnering only five points from the Dubai leg after falling 33-7 to France in the bowl semi-final.
However, they responded quickly and bounced back in the second leg in Cape Town where they reached the Main Cup semi-final, but lost to Argentina 26-14. They also lost to France in the third-place play-offs.
Ayimba's men were equally in a fine form in the Wellington leg, winning their first two Group D matches against Canada (37-7) and Portugal (26-5) but lost 17-12 to Australia and 36-0 to hosts and champions New Zealand in the quarter final.

Kenya then lost 35-14 to Argentina in the plate semi-final.
But as the team prepares for this weekend's fourth leg in Sydney, Australia, where they have been drawn in Pool B against series leaders and rivals South Africa, Russia and Scotland, Ayimba says they have corrected their mistakes and are eager to top the Group.
“All we want is to do well this year and improve on last season's overall position. But from our recent results and the mood in the camp, I think a top five-finish is quite realistic. I believe it is achievable,' Ayimba said on phone from Sydney.
“We always expect to top the pool and that is our priority. We are working on the breakdown point, which has cost us in terms of penalties conceded.
“The positive thing is that we don't have any fresh injuries and everybody is ready to bounce back from the Wellington performance.”
Commenting on assistant captain and record-chasing Collins Injera's performance so far, Ayimba said;
“Injera is just playing his role in the team and that's what he is concentrating on right now. The tries will be as a result of that.”
Injera, third in the all-time scoring chart, scored his 213th try against Argentina on Sunday and is now seven tries behind England legend Ben Gollings and 17 behind Argentina's current head coach Santiago Gomez Cora.
Kenya will kick off their Sydney campaign on Saturday morning with a tie against Russia at 4:06am before playing Scotland at 7:24am. They will wrap up their pool fixtures against South Africa at 11:05am.
Research from the University of Reading suggests that two glasses of champagne a day may be good for your heart and circulation. The researchers have found that drinking champagne wine daily in moderate amounts causes improvements in the way blood vessels function.
Champagne does this by increasing the availability of nitric oxide, a vascular active molecule which controls blood pressure. It is able to induce these effects because it contains polyphenols, plant chemicals from the red grapes and white grapes used in champagne production.
When you drink champagne, these polyphenols get absorbed into the circulation where they are able to act on the vascular system. Specifically, they appear to slow down the natural removal of nitric oxide from our blood, meaning that it will have a longer time to act on blood vessels and so improve the flow of blood around the body.
High nitric oxide levels in the blood, as a result of drinking champagne, can have beneficial effects, because as well as increasing blood flow, it may help to decrease both blood pressure and the likelihood of blood clots forming. This could therefore reduce the risks of suffering from cardiovascular disease and stroke, but more research needs to be done to determine the long term effects of daily champagne consumption.
Dr Jeremy Spencer, from the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences said: "Our research has shown that drinking around two glasses of champagne can have beneficial effects on the way blood vessels function, in a similar way to that observed with red wine. We always encourage a responsible approach to alcohol consumption, but the fact that drinking champagne has the potential to reduce the risks of suffering from cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke, is very exciting news."
Editor's Note: Budget room aggregator Oyo Rooms is one of the most funded players in its space. Armed with funding from Sequoia Capital and Softbank, the startup was reportedly in talks to acquire its competitor Zo rooms. The story of Oyo Rooms almost reads like a fairy tale; helmed by 21-year-old Thiel fellow Ritesh Agarwal, an investigative feature that dug deep into its origins found plenty of cracks in the founder's narrative. Our perceptions of the startup were tempered by a number of unhappy accounts on blogs and many such personal experiences from Twitter users.
Kunal Pandya, CEO of Gujarat-based NCrypted, which calls itself a startup enabler, says his company had licensed its vacation rental product Bistrostays to the founder when Oyo Rooms was called Oravel. Pandya recently called Agarwal out on Twitter for his alleged coding skills, as reported by a leading national newspaper. We encouraged Pandya to mail us his side of the story.
What follows is the letter Pandya sent, with no additions from Gadgets 360, and changes only to correct typos:
The media is giving too much attention and hype to Ritesh Agarwal, founder of Oyo Rooms, and seems to be posting whatever he has to share. What's surprising is that Ritesh is trying to present himself as a 'coder' in front of the media - surprising because Oyo's parent company Oravel has been our NCrypted's client, and we knew Ritesh from before he was famous.
The truth is that the early days of Oravel and Oyo were built on a foundation of lies and Ritesh seems to have faked almost everything that stands as his founding pillars, from his education to funding rounds.
In the early days, I was a partner to Ritesh when he was new to the industry, and can personally comment on some of the myths behind the Oyo story.
Let me tell you one thing straight away - the guy is an outright liar. He knows no coding and has faked almost every credential prior to his funding rounds. I am not in contact with him since Oyo's second round of VC funding with Sequoia in early 2015, and can't comment if he learned some kind of coding afterwards, but much of what had to happen already by then.
His age has certainly played a factor behind much of this hype and people got curious as to how a 21 year old can build such a website and a business around it. This is the true story of how he got started, and how NCrypted played a major role in building his career.
Chapter 1 - Ritesh Agarwal meets Kunal Pandya of NCrypted to develop his website
Ritesh contacted us in June 2012 to enquire about our vacation rental product BistroStays. Apart from the domain license, he required many customisations as well. This was before Oyo Rooms was launched, and Ritesh had just gotten started with Oravel, which had a couple of static pages and practically no traffic.
At this time, the business did not have any VC or angel funding at all. Ritesh hadn't gone for the much hyped Peter Thiel fellowship yet, and he hadn't joined Venture Nursery yet.
According to him, he 'tried' to attend college for a day, but the reality was he was just a 12th grader who knew some basics about websites and was very enthusiastic about the new dotcom boom in India.
Our job was simple just like any other software vendor - irrespective of who you are and what you do, if you want to buy our products and services, then we would be happy to serve.
Ritesh didn't know anything about coding; he just knew that he wanted to quickly create an Airbnb clone and get a couple of million dollars of funding. To do this, he needed our code - BistroStays lets you start your own vacation/ apartment rental website - without needing to know anything about coding. It is a bundled Web product and you don't require any programming knowledge to start and operate it.
Unfortunately, we soon found out that Ritesh and his company Oravel Stays didn't have the money to pay us. For months, we went to him with bills but didn't get any payment after the first upfront payment was made to start the project.
Ritesh desperately wanted to launch the site on the new product and kept on promising me personally that he would pay soon. Trust is a major factor in our industry, so we went ahead, deployed the product and activated the license file.
Here is how the site looked in January 2012 before it was deployed on our product. And here is a screenshot of the site taken in December 2012 after the site started running on our product. BistroStays was powering the site till mid-2013, when we had to withdraw and cancel the license due to payment issues.
The software allowed Ritesh to start listing sellers and buyers as they could sign up themselves. With the advanced admin panel back-end system, it was now possible for them to monitor and keep a track of what's happening with every single module that is in transition.
The SEO-friendly front-end helped as they started seeing some organic traffic on the site on their Delhi NCR property listings.
Chapter 2 - Ritesh offers equity partnership to us since he couldn't pay in cash
Since we refused to continue working unless all outstanding dues are settled, Ritesh offered around 1.5 to 2 percent equity in Oravel Stays to me along with half payment settlement as per the dues. He shared his bank balance screenshot which had less than Rs. 50,000, and I already started to feel cheated." If you don't have money, why request for such heavy customisations and force us on launching the site," I asked to myself.
Eventually, we decided that he was just a 21-year-old in over his head, and didn't think that he would be intentionally cheating us. And so we chose to believe him, because I rather wanted to back him. We are a startup enabler and all our products are targeted for startups and small to medium scale businesses. Their success is our success.
In July 2012, we worked out on a deal for stock and cash wherein Oravel Stays will issue about 420 fresh shared to us, plus cash, and we continue the relationship. The papers were not yet signed as Ritesh insisted that we do so next month, just before getting funded.
Somewhere around in August, after the beta site was launched on our product, Ritesh told me that Venture Nursery has made the investment. This was a surprise to me, as Ritesh had still not signed our agreement, and now our money and our shares were at stake.
Ritesh had said Venture Nursery would invest somewhere between Rs. 50 to Rs. 75 lakhs but he then shared a picture of the cheque from Venture Nursery of just Rs. 5 lakhs. This was less than the dues he already owed us, and I started losing trust.
Apoorv Sharma, who was Executive VP of Venture Nursery at that time, called me to understand how the product works. Ritesh acknowledged this in an email exchange with Apoorv and me, writing that NCrypted has been a huge support in building Oravel's next high quality site and support.
So, Ritesh got the beta site live running on our product, and showcased that to Venture Nursery. Venture Nursery now got interested and enrolled him into its accelerator program, with a promise of Rs. 5 lakh investment.
Chapter 3 - Parting ways
With our product in the back-end, Oravel was shaping up fine. We were yet to get paid but kept working and trusting Ritesh. We had two options - either quit or keep working, and we thought that if we quit, we will never recover the money he owed us.
So it seemed to be in the best of our own interest, at that time, to see to it that his website shapes up well and gets funded, so that we can get paid and have some real worth to our 'promised' equity.
Our accounts team meanwhile kept sending invoices to Ritesh and he continued delaying. I personally asked Ritesh to send us postdated cheques as security, until we have the agreement signed. Many of his cheques had already bounced by this time.
Ritesh slowly stopped updating me on funding rounds and his experience with VentureNursery; and our team, as per our commitment, continued working on his product.
Somewhere around in February 2013, Ritesh hired developers to work on Oravel.com. They took their own sweet time to learn the system.
Meanwhile Ritesh had our copyright notice removed from the site footer and this is how we got to know that he has started working with somebody else despite having all these promises of equity plus cash.
It was time that we had to part ways. I asked him to discontinue using the product as we will withdraw the license because of overdue accounting for more than six months. At the time, Ritesh continued to insist on an equity partnership.
In March 2013, Oravel finally discontinued using our product after a series of emailed requests. Ritesh refused to pay part of the remaining dues and argued that since Oravel was no longer using the product, it wouldn't pay for the product at all. Our legal team was planning to file a case but I didn't want to focus on this dead client, so I said that we will accept the remaining dues and preferred to focus on our own business.
While this was happening, Ritesh got the Thiel scholarship of $100,000 (approximately Rs. 66 lakh), and a couple of rounds of angel and VC funding, but he kept us in the dark, instead of paying the money he owed quickly.
I later learned that Venture Nursery and some other angel investor had put in Rs 30 lakh into Oravel after the initial Rs. 5 lakh, probably after the launch of the website running on our product. Ritesh never shared this with me, as otherwise he would have had to pay the dues and sign the stocks deal which he had promised.
During all this, Venture Nursery kept investing in media and PR, and Ritesh was noticed by the world, pitched as a 21-year-old coder with an angel backed venture, seeking more VC funding as the business is now ready to expand. Except of course, none of this was really true.
Chapter 4 - The Thiel Fellowship
When Ritesh was still struggling with the new site development after we removed our product, luck came to his aide.
Somewhere during March end 2013, Ritesh got the big news - he was selected as the first Indian to receive Thiel Fellowship. According to the Mint article, Ritesh wrote to his newly hired freelancers, "One thing is pretty urgent -Let's make the earlier code and database we had on the live site... Until then we can't afford to have the 20 under-20 guys take a note of we're not having a real product... we can use the situation to our advantage in the manner of launching the day we have the final conference (13th)."
This archive of Oravel.com taken on April 23, 2013 shows they were present in more than 60 cities in India and had properties in Singapore as well. Some of the city names are incorrect and the site is entirely static with no real back-end present. Any experienced coder should have recognised this, but that's not what happened.
Instead, they bought the story and Ritesh got lucky yet again. He not only received a $100,000 scholarship from the Thiel Foundation, but got a big Silicon Valley name backing his company.
In May, Venture Nursery arranged for a PR agency for press interviews on the Thiel fellowship. The rest of the story is published in Mint. Ritesh continued his saga of faking and screwing relationships once he got what he wanted from it after this as well.
Chapter 5 - What comes next?
Guys like Rahul Yadav, the ex-CEO and founder of Housing.com, and Ritesh Agarwal of Oyo Rooms, are ruining the Indian startup ecosystem.
They are presenting themselves as India's Steve Jobs, projecting themselves as 'products guys' and if you read any media interviews of these guys, they constantly try to project themselves as big thinkers and innovators.
But when you look at it, what innovation has Oyo Rooms actually done? This entire idea is running behind the logic of launching an Airbnb clone in India, and later pivoting to an Uber type of business model.
Now, of course, you have to implement this in a new market and India brings its own set of hurdles, so hard work is accepted from that point of view. The problem rather is when these guys project themselves as so-called 'innovators'. And, hell, Ritesh went ahead and called all of his competition as imitators and copycats?
Surprisingly, Softbank is a common large investor in both Housing and Oyo Rooms; both startups founded by big-mouthed 'visionaries'.
But the Indian audience and Internet users at large are not stupid. They don't want startup heroes. They simply want a solid product to solve their real life problems. If these guys can do that well while not trying to burn easy VC money, they will have a better chance. But that doesn't seem to be happening as Oyo Rooms' business model requires them to burn cash heavily, not just on operations and human resources, but on partner hotel retainers as well.
Hotels I've spoken to tell me that Oyo has to buy out a specific quota of rooms with partners on a monthly basis, whether or not they are able to re-sell them. That's why Oyo is able to offer hotels for Rs. 999 even though the hotel charges Rs. 2,000 if you go directly. Now you know where the $125 million funding is going.
For now, it benefits the hotels and the travellers, but there are problems that will certainly occur down the road. HomeJoy.com, a US based Uber-for-X startup faced this tough question after three years of its inception and had to shut down. Oyo is moving in the same direction right now.
Ritesh might have gotten lucky and was able to get funding rounds by selling fake numbers, but the end consumer is not stupid. They don't want to use Oyo just because it was built by a 21-year-old. They want to use it because they find something dirt cheap and too good to be true. The billion dollar question is - when the party ends and VC money dries up, how will Oyo be able to provide dirt cheap rates?

CHICAGO, IL - JULY 15: Activists rally in Chicago's South Side for Trayvon Martin in addition to ending gun violence in their own city July 15, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois. On Saturday, a jury in Sanford, Florida found Zimmerman not-guilty in the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Since the verdict was announced thousands across the nation have protested the outcome of the case. (Photo by Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images)
While the nation was fixated on the trial of George Zimmerman, who Saturday was acquitted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, many were left wondering when the media would tell their similarly tragic stories of lives lost to gun violence.
Over the duration of the trial, over 50 people's lives came to an end in shootings in Chicago alone -- many of them black and many of them teenagers, just like Trayvon.
In the days since the trial, three more people were killed in Chicago shootings, including 16-year-old Joseph Brewer Jr. Brewer, who was gunned down Sunday afternoon while walking to visit his infant daughter, loved video games, basketball and was "family-oriented," his family told the Chicago Tribune.
Peaky Blinders fans can now celebrate the show with a brand-new ale available at Aldi.
The 'Peaky Blinder' brew is described by Black Country brewery Sadler's as 'dark and delicious', a Black Indian Pale Ale with an ABV of 4.4 percent.
The ale was first launched in 2014 following the first series of the 1920s BBC2 gangster series set in Birmingham.

Now Aldi has added craft beer to its shelves for just £1.29 a bottle.
It's brewed with five different malts and five different hop varieties and is available in cask, bottle and keg.
Speaking about the product, Managing Director of Sadler's Brewing Company, Chris Sadler told LADbible: "This is a beer we love to brew and we are very proud to have supplied the past premieres and launch events for the Peaky Blinders TV series
"Dark beers were very popular in the early 20th Century and it's nice to see this fashion returning for the modern day beer drinker
"Linking this epic beer to our region and the Peaky Blinders has been a great project for our brew team and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do"
Here's how Twitter reacted to the bottle:

Now this is a shock. After working on the project for many years, Edgar Wright has quit Marvel's Ant-Man, just as physical production work approached.
Thus far, all we know is that creative differences have been cited. In a statement put out from Marvel, it said that "Marvel and Edgar Wright jointly announced today that the studio and director have parted ways on ANT-MAN due to differences in their vision of the film. The decision to move on is amicable and does not impact the release date on July 17, 2015. A new director will be announced shortly".
Time is not on Marvel's side here. Whilst there's precedent for it losing a director close to a shooting date - Patty Jenkins departed Thor 2, before Alan Taylor took charge - the fact that Wright had been so close to Ant-Man for so long, and that he's co-penned the script, makes it very much a project with his identity on it. Plus when the director changed on Thor: The Dark World, there was still a little time to settle someone new in.
The cast- featuring Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas - still stands. Expect an announcement of a new director very soon.

Director of new documentary about gun violence in America says the National Rifle Association misleads its members and profits off politics
News anchor Katie Couric and director Stephanie Soechtig have collaborated on two previous documentaries: Tapped, which looked at the environmental consequences of the bottled water industry, and Fed Up, which examined the role of sugar in America's obesity epidemic.
Under the Gun, their new documentary on gun violence in America, premieres on Epix on Sunday at 8pm ET. The film, a Sundance favorite, provides an in-depth look at the ways gun control advocates have tried to counteract the power of the National Rifle Association.
Soechtig talked to the Guardian about how she approached the polarizing issue of guns in America – and what change she would like to see. (The interview has been edited for length and clarity.)
'Did a bunch of little kids get shot today?' Stars join march for 'gun sense' Read more
How did you decide to do a film tackling the issue of guns in America?
In 2014, Katie was like, “I want to talk to you about this idea that I had.” The Isla Vista Shooting happened on May 22. She called me and said, “I've been covering this issue for 30 years and the situation seems to be getting worse. Could we give this the same exploration of Fed Up and really unpack this issue in this holistic and comprehensive way?”
My first impression was, really, don't we know everything about this issue? When I started digging in, there was so much that I didn't know.
What surprised you?
Anything that's in the film is something that surprised me. The first thing I learned that – you've got to be kidding me – is that 40% of guns in this country are bought without a background check. That just astounded me. That the ATF doesn't have computerized records. That the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was banned from researching this as a public health issue.
As well as interviewing the families of mass shooting victims, you went to Chicago to interview families there. What did you learn about the way that race plays into the gun debate?
In Chicago, we featured the Bosleys, and I chose them because I feel they were a great juxtaposition to the Bardens [whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School]. These are both families that have three children, that lost one, and the response from the community was so different for the Bardens than it was for the Bosleys. I think race was a huge component to that. I think the idea that black lives don't matter has a lot of merit to it.

Chicago has a mass shooting every other week. The grief counsellors don't come out. There's no CNN breaking news alert. I'd like to think it's more nuanced than race, but at the same time, it's the only difference I can see. Unless it's the idea that it's gangs, that these lives are less valuable because they're in gangs, which we show in the film is often not the case.
Were there moments when you felt shocked or outraged?
More than the outrage of the stranglehold that the National Rifle Association has over our legislative process – that was, of course, infuriating and outrageous – what really shocked me more was seeing that the NRA only really represents 5% of gun owners, to see that they're not really speaking for gun owners.
It had sort of became really confusing for me, for a while: why are they so powerful when the majority of their members don't agree with the position they take? Their connection with the gun industry – that this is more about promoting gun sales than protecting your second amendment rights – was a real “aha” moment for me, because I felt that gun owners are being duped, that they've been sold a bill of goods by the NRA, as well.
Smart guns: how Obama hopes to create a market for personalized weapons Read more
The NRA has ginned up an idea that this is a huge debate, when 90% of the country agrees on background checks. That's not a debate. Ninety per cent of the country doesn't like kittens.
What makes you think that gun owners are being duped?
The NRA toes this line that the government is trying to take your guns away. Seventy per cent of NRA members want background checks but the NRA opposes them at every turn. Background checks means they'll sell fewer guns. The members have been duped. The NRA doesn't care about your second amendment rights.
Then why don't we see more NRA members protesting what the NRA is doing?
I don't think that they've known about it before this film came out.
At one screening, an NRA member told me, “I am embarrassed and outraged that I am an NRA member and this is happening.” She found it duplicitous, the way they are opposing the most commonsense measures. She just had no idea.
The NRA has not been subtle about its opposition to background checks. It's not subtle about its politics in general. How could it be possible most NRA members don't realize what the NRA is doing?
I think a lot of gun owners join the NRA because they get deals, they get discounts. If you sign up for the NRA and see their newsletters, they're always: “They're coming to get your guns.” They don't advertise: “Oh, we were able to strip the CDC of researching gun violence as a public health debate,” or, “We made it so you can bring your guns into bars.”

You should ask an NRA member why they don't know. I can just tell you we've been consistently told, “I had no idea.”
What leads you to think that the NRA doesn't care about the second amendment? That's a provocative statement?
I don't think that they don't care about the second amendment. I think they have a unique interpretation of it. I think they wrap themselves in the second amendment, but I really think their fundamental interest is selling more guns.
Is there something wrong with selling more guns?
There's nothing wrong with selling more guns, as long as we're taking measures to sell guns to responsible gun owners.
Did you try to get NRA officials to represent their views in the documentary?
Oh, repeatedly. We got a blanket “no”. Could we have Wayne LaPierre? No. Can we have Chris Cox? No. Can we have any board member? No. We said to them, what if we did a live interview, unedited? And they also said no.
Did they give any reasons for that?
Not one.
Incidents of toddlers shooting others or themselves increasing, data shows Read more
Why do you think they refused?
I think when confronted with the facts, they would have a hard time defending themselves. When they can continue to spew their rhetoric unchallenged, they can continue to stay on point and on brand.
Most of the experts in your film are very strongly tilted towards gun control. Did you try to hear from researchers or experts who aren't gun control advocates, who are more on the gun rights side?
We spoke to Richard Feldman, who is a former lobbyist for the NRA.
We spoke to John Lott; he will be featured in a digital companion that we have. We did a great piece on him. He's the originator of the idea that more guns equal less crime. His research has been criticized and largely discredited, and when we went to include it in the film, it felt like unnecessary real estate to put in the film, because we know his research has been debunked many times. We kept going back to the idea that we wanted to reserve the real estate in the film for the responsible gun owners.
In the film, you focus on poll results suggesting that the majority of NRA members say they support universal background checks on gun sales. But, in the film, when you talked to a focus group of gun owners, people willing to go on camera, most of them opposed universal background checks. Did you explore that contrast?
To me, the Virginia Citizens Defense League represents that very small fringe of gun owners that don't support really any gun safety measures. What's interesting: when you speak to them, they agree that people should be trained, they agree that people should put safety locks on their firearms. They don't think it should be legally required.

When you saw NRA members outside the convention, you saw that four out of five of them said, “Of course we should have background checks.” We have to show that where the stranglehold comes from is this small but noisy fringe who are single-issue voters, who call their elected officials.
What impact would you like to see from this film?
The best case scenario would be to inspire people to make gun sense their voting priority. I think many of us are outraged by gun violence. But few people act on it. I know I didn't before this. I didn't do anything after Sandy Hook happened. I didn't call my elected officials. I didn't know what effect that would really have. I hope this film gives people hope to think that their voices count. The NRA is such a great example in showing that a small group of people can really make a difference. We heard from so many people who say: “We don't get as many calls from gun safety advocates as gun advocates.”
I hope that within the NRA, people say, “You do not represent me, and I will not be a member,” that they will rescind their membership until the NRA represents their views. I hope there is an uprising within the NRA to hold leadership accountable.
During the process of making the film, were there any points when you were convinced that the gun rights advocates were right?
I worked at Fox and on the O'Reilly Factor for a long time. I could see at times where people were coming from. I could see why Victoria Montgomery wants to carry a gun to protect her baby. I don't agree with it, but I respect her point of view.
Do you think Wayne LaPierre truly believes the government wants to confiscate guns?
They can't. It would be physically impossible. There are 300m guns in this country and the second amendment protects people's right to own guns. This is not a contentious issue. In the two years I spent making this film, I did not meet one person who thought we should ban guns.
But do you think LaPierre actually believes this could happen?
No, I think he knows that it can't happen. I think he knows what he's doing. This is a man who makes a million dollars a year. His bottom line would be threatened if he gave up the idea.
Having spent so much time with gun control advocates, do you think there is anything that the gun control movement gets wrong, or that they could do better?
I think the assault weapon ban of 1994 was really poorly written and poorly executed.
The gun safety advocates – there are some that would benefit from having more conversations with gun owners. I think the good ones really try, and really embrace gun owners. When I was in Chicago, a man came up to thank me for the film and was talking to me about how crazy this open-carry woman was. I told him, I don't think it's productive for you to write her off as crazy. You'll never further the conversation if you do that.
Fabulous discoveries are often followed by exceedingly dull paperwork, such as the checking and rechecking of data, graphs, statistical analyses and conclusions. This week's announcement that scientists had found evidence of briny water on Mars will have had many experts reaching for the small print of Nasa Policy Directive 8020.7G.
The directive is required reading for those who send spacecraft to hunt for extraterrestrial life. It codifies the etiquette for “planetary protection” — preventing earthlings and their emissaries from contaminating their celestial bodies (known as forwards contamination), and arguably more importantly, guarding against the encroachment of alien microbes into the terrestrial biosphere (backwards contamination).
While the concerns about our germs hitchhiking to other worlds date back to the 1950s, this week's revelation — and its implications for the possibility of life elsewhere in the solar system — should prompt an urgent reappraisal of how we maintain the absolute integrity of both the Martian and terrestrial biospheres.
The evidence for water flowing on the red planet was gathered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a Nasa spacecraft launched in 2005, with images that showed dark streaks down the walls of a crater. The streaks were found to carry the infrared signature of hydrated salts, which is regarded as a proxy for water.
The results were published on Monday in Nature Geoscience. They were prefigured, however, in images dating back to Mariner 9, which began orbiting Mars in 1971. These revealed a world seemingly sculpted by liquid: valleys and canyons, ancient river beds and branching canals. Even in the 1960s, Earth-based observations suggested the spectral signature of water vapour in the thin Martian atmosphere.
A succession of orbiters and landers added layers of evidence: polar caps comprising vast quantities of water ice; rocks and pebbles rounded and smoothed as if by water; clumps of material, dug up by a robotic arm, which subsequently vaporised, indicating subsurface water; and permafrost-like patterns beneath the scarlet dust.
What made Monday's announcement significant was its confirmation that liquid water flows on the planet's surface today, albeit only seasonally. Mars is smaller than Earth with a much weaker gravitational field; it had been postulated that liquid water would just float away.
Astrobiologists, who study the origins of life in the universe, are thrilled: their guiding principle is to “follow the water”, since all known life, or life forms, need water for survival.
There is an urgent need to develop the technology required to make sure future landers are not the bringers of bacterial doom
There is a class of extremophiles — organisms that survive in extreme environments — which thrive in salty, dehydrated surroundings. Scientists have found such “halophiles” in the ultra-dry Atacama Desert in Chile, in the form of microbes living in salt crystals (they absorb moisture from the atmosphere). Halophiles often contain a protein called bacteriorhodopsin; this might narrow the search for a smoking gun for life on Mars.
The obligation of space agencies to prevent contamination of Earth and other planets is stated in the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty, which started life as a means of preventing the Moon and planets being used for hostile purposes. Earlier this year, astrobiologists raised concerns that ultra-sensitive space instruments and their associated electronics were now made of materials too delicate to withstand heat sterilisation.
While that is usually fine for orbiters, which do not land, it poses a challenge to missions such as Nasa's Mars 2020 mission, due to touch down on the Red Planet after 2020.
There is an urgent need to develop the technology required to make sure future landers are not the bringers of bacterial doom. As humanity embarks on a search for Martian life in the brine, we must ensure that our methods are ethically watertight.

Shown here is a close-up view of a common fly. PETA miffed at Obama's fly 'execution'
The president has been getting lots of kudos for a lightning-fast, Mr. Miyagi-worthy swipe he employed to slay a pesky housefly that was buzzing him in mid-interview during a taping with CNBC that aired Wednesday.
“He stopped the interview to track and kill the fly,” said talk show host Conan O'Brien.

“That's some pretty impressive hand-eye coordination right there,” Jimmy Fallon gushed. “Makes Obama look like a bad ass.”
But now People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, calling it an “execution,” wants the commander-in-chief to show a little more compassion to even “the least sympathetic animals.”
“Believe it or not, we've actually been contacted by multiple media outlets wanting to know PETA's official response to the executive insect execution,” a blog on the group's website explained. “In a nutshell, our position is this: He isn't the Buddha, he's a human being, and human beings have a long way to go before they think before they act.”
The group has sent Obama a device that traps a fly so it can then be released outside.
“We believe that people, where they can be compassionate, should be, for all animals,” PETA spokesman Bruce Freidrich explained.

The fly saga began Tuesday, and it was the subject of a news report on Italian TV and almost a dozen YouTube postings that have been viewed more than 750,000 times. Thousands of people also have added commentary, including one who wrote, “But can he duck a shoe?” in reference to a hugely popular video of former president George Bush ducking a shoe thrown at him by an Iraqi cameraman during a news conference in Baghdad.
“Get out of here,” Obama said as the fly buzzed him during his interview. The pest persisted, and when it landed on his left forearm, Obama smacked it.
“Now, where were we?” the president said without missing a beat. Pleased with himself, he added, “That was pretty impressive, wasn't it? I got the sucker.”
Several observers in the room gave congratulatory shout-outs. Obama pointed to the floor and instructed an obliging cameraman to get a close-up of the corpse.
“It's like he's got one of those fly Terminator targeting systems in his eyes,” said an awed Jon Stewart.

Sick of taking responsibility for the shitty things that have happened to you in your life? Help is on the way, in the virginal and strangely vacant form of three bible-thumping teenage exorcists from Phoenix, Arizona. Eighteen-year-old Brynne Larson and her friends Tess and Savannah Sherkenback (18 and 21, respectively) claim to be able to confront the demons lurking inside traumatized people and draw them out using nothing more than a crucifix and a few choice words. But are these teenage exorcists really empowered by the Almighty, or merely by Brynne's father, a failed televangelist named Reverend Bob?
In a new film coming soon to VICE, the girls and Reverend Bob give us exclusive access to their tour of Ukraine, during which they attempt to save the souls of recovering drug addicts and sexual abuse victims.
Before Gizmodo, I worked in the bowels of the broadcast industry for a number of years. I was either shooting video or cutting video every day, all day. And while Final Cut Pro and Adobe After Effects were both tools I used with some proficiency on a daily basis, I've never seen a post production demo as incredible as this clip from the University of Washington. Essentially, you shoot some crappy, low-rez video of a still scene. You then reshoot the same scene with a digital camera (with higher resolution). Software can automagically combine these images to upconvert the video AND fix problems in the image- all while compensating for 3D space. Make sense? The remarkable demo will clarify things a bit:

What's especially notable is that the software can fill in the nasty bits of the scene despite the videographer/photographer rotating their view (you see this as they shoot around the tree) and despite any lens differences (the software can compensate for different lens sizes/distortions). Also, note that many details from the source video are retained (the glass reflections in the statue shot may be the best example), which means that the photograph's information isn't the only information we see in the composite image. I'm not quite convinced that the entire process is quite as automatic as the students would make it, but the technology is extremely promising all the same. And at this point, it should only be a matter of time before we see the idea work its way into our favorite post production products. [Project Page via bbGadgets]

Steven Taylor has insisted he has no intention of quitting Newcastle United.
The Magpies defender has been linked with a move to Arsenal and Marseille this summer, while Fulham are also understood to be monitoring the Toon Academy product.
However, the 27-year-old still has three years left on his current deal and is a player Alan Pardew wants to keep on Tyneside.
Pardew knows the importance of retaining the Greenwich-born stopper next season.
Taylor has shrugged off talk he wants to leave the club he supported as a boy by saying: “I am still living my dream here.
“Being at Newcastle is the best thing which has ever happened to me.
“I am still living the dream of every young lad that is in this city.
“I still cannot describe the feeling when you walk over that line in front of 52,000 fans in a stadium like ours.
“It is what I have always wanted to do. I have to keep pinching myself.”
Taylor was heavily linked with a move away from St James' Park when United were relegated in 2009.
However, he stuck with the club and helped gain promotion a year later.
On Newcastle's return to the top flight, a contract dispute resulted in a temporary stint on the transfer list.
Yet this was something which was resolved days after Pardew was appointed manager.
Taylor said he never wanted to leave the club.
He added: “I was part of the team which was relegated.
“So I wanted to be part of the team which went up.
“I have been at the club since I was nine at the School of Excellence. As I say, this is my dream.”
While the team ended the season enduring intense criticism, the former England Under-21 skipper knows it is part and parcel of being at Newcastle.
He said: “As long as I have known the defence has always been criticised.
“If you cannot handle that, what is the point in playing football?”
The committee is a group of aging men with dyed hair and dark suits who make all major decisions about the economy, foreign policy and other issues. Their meetings are not publicized in the state news media. The party chief often presides, but they operate by consensus, which means decisions are generally made only when the members reach agreement.
They also must solicit the input of retired members, now more than a dozen, who at times exert considerable influence, most of all Mr. Hu's 86-year-old predecessor, Jiang Zemin. Mr. Jiang and other elders are deeply engaged in the backstage negotiations to appoint the next generation of leaders.

Members of the committee represent different patronage networks and hold different portfolios — security, propaganda, the economy and so on — which can result in competing interests. Business lobbies are represented informally on the committee, and the members often have longstanding ties to China's powerful state-owned enterprises; for example, the current chief of domestic security, Zhou Yongkang, once managed a state-owned oil company and is known to be a defender of the oil industry.
“Each of the nine wants to protect his patch,” said a political analyst connected to central party officials.
Alice L. Miller, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Hoover Institution, said at a recent talk in Washington that a shrinking of the committee represents an attempt by the party to address shortcomings. “The most compelling one is that there seems to be a trend in policy stagnation,” she said, “an inability to arrive at decisions collectively within the standing committee that I think shows up in a number of different ways.”
Yet the move to trim the committee, many experts argue, has exacerbated factional wrangling over its incoming membership. Mr. Xi and Li Keqiang, pegged to be the next prime minister, are virtually guaranteed seats. Other favorites now are Zhang Dejiang, a vice prime minister and party secretary of Chongqing; Wang Qishan, another vice prime minister; Zhang Gaoli, party chief of Tianjin; and Liu Yunshan, director of the propaganda bureau. With that lineup, the remaining seat is expected to go to either Li Yuanchao, head of the Organization Department, or Yu Zhengsheng, party chief of Shanghai. Both had been strong contenders until recent weeks, when word spread that either could be excluded.

The idea of shrinking the committee was first laid out in discussions in the summer of 2011, but it did not emerge as a plan until this year, said a central government media official with ties to “princeling” families from the Communist aristocracy of revolutionary leaders and their descendants.

“The entire top echelon came to a unified viewpoint on this general direction, including former standing committee members,” he said. “The consensus was that greater unity and efficiency was needed at the top.”
He and others said that the case of Bo Xilai, who was a controversial contender for a standing committee seat even before he was purged in a scandal last spring, also became a rationale for shrinking the body, in part to counter deepening divisions within the party. “If everyone was not singing a different tune, there's no way that Bo Xilai could have emerged as he did,” said Li Weidong, another well-connected scholar.
Another important factor was the feeling among many party officials that the security apparatus has grown too powerful, particularly in the past five years under Mr. Zhou. Some also contend that Mr. Bo, in turn, was Mr. Zhou's preferred successor.

As part of the contraction, the party commission post now occupied by Mr. Zhou would be downgraded from the standing committee to the Politburo level, with the portfolio expected to be given to a committee member with other responsibilities. The same could happen to the propaganda portfolio.
Word that the body could be trimmed to seven members began to spread through party circles at around the time party authorities polled top officials and elders in May on their picks for the next committee.
Mr. Xi and Mr. Hu may both be pushing for the downsizing of the committee, but they have different interests in mind, say party insiders. A smaller committee could, at least in theory, give either man more leverage and authority. And either could be better positioned to maneuver their allies and protégés into top seats at the next congress five years from now, halfway through Mr. Xi's likely decade-long tenure, when several members of the committee would be expected to retire.
Mr. Hu's power appears to have been hampered in the past decade by the fact that the committee was heavy with leaders who owe their promotions to his predecessor Mr. Jiang, Mr. Xi among them. Many party insiders blame factional tensions for contributing to Mr. Hu's rigid aversion to promoting bold policies. Many of the current favorites for the standing committee are seen as protégés of Mr. Jiang, as well as likely allies of Mr. Xi.
Photo
Despite China's economic growth of the past decade, there is now a strong sense among policymakers and intellectuals that the nation lost an opportunity to strengthen its economy and reinvigorate its political system. Mr. Xi is hearing a chorus of calls from policy advisers, academics and economists to rekindle the kind of liberalization that languished under Mr. Hu. But if he were to pursue that, he would confront an enormous challenge in forging consensus among elders, peers and other powerful interests.

Before Mr. Hu ascended to party chief in late 2002, he favored a seven-member committee, but he and Mr. Jiang failed to agree on the lineup. That resulted in Mr. Hu having to settle for a nine-member committee stacked with more of Mr. Jiang's allies, said Mr. Chen, the political analyst.
Before that, committee seats had generally ranged from 5 to 7, though it reached 11 in 1966. Personal power struggles have played decisive roles before in determining the committee size. In 1987, party leaders had agreed to expand the committee to seven from five. But the top leader, Deng Xiaoping, was forced to scrap the plan after conservative elders sprang last-minute objections to two committee candidates, according to an account in a memoir by Zhao Ziyang, the party chief ousted in 1989.
The plan to shrink the committee this year could still founder if leaders fail to agree on who should be promoted to a smaller body. The end result could be a retention of the nine-member committee to accommodate all the interests.

With the weekly guessing game that is the National Football League, each step of the season leaves us with several players who fell short of expectations and a handful that exceeded even the rosiest of projections. And with that, we bring you our set of Week 4 Achievers to recap the Week 4 of the fantasy football season. Do you try to buy low on the duds and sell high on the studs? Well, it isn't always that simple…
Quarterback
Over-achiever – Phillip Rivers (SD)
35-for-42, 401 yards, 3 TDs
Perhaps we were just a year too early on the Philip Rivers remains an elite QB bandwagon. Hyped as one of the positions' top values heading in to 2012, the BretskyBall staff whiffed on what was a painfully underwhelming season from Rivers last year. In 2013, it's a different story. The Chargers have been one of the biggest surprises over the first quarter of the season and their veteran signal caller deserve much of the credit. Having a healthy Antonio Gates certainly helps, but with a supporting cast highlighted by Eddie Royal, Ryan Mathews, Danny Woodhead and Ronnie Brown, Rivers deserve a whole bunch of the credit. He's been accurate and decisive, reminding us of the quarterback who was quickly rising to elite levels in his first couple of seasons rather than the perennial loser we've become accustomed to. We're still banking on Rivers finishing well outside of the top-5 for the season, but with the Chargers soft upcoming schedule a run at the top-10 is within reason. Considering that Rivers was just the 24th QB taken in preseason drafts and remained available in 39% of standard leagues prior to Week 4, it is easy to say that he deserves a bit more credit than we have collectively been willing to give.
Under-achiever – Russell Wilson (SEA)
12-for-23, 123 yards, 0 TDs, 77 rush yards
For the third time this season, Russell Wilson put together a mediocre fantasy performance, following up his four-TD game against the Jaguars a week ago with a 12-for-23 stinker in which he totals just 123 yards and no touchdowns. While 77 rushing yards on 10 carries allowed owners to squeeze a little something out of the afternoon, its been an uninspiring season overall for the Seahawks QB after he snuck inside the top-10 on average at the draft table. Yes, many ranked him as a top option presuming the presence of Percy Harvin, but Wilson was a much better player down the stretch last season then we are seeing right now. Wilson has thrown a pick in each of his last three games and has seen his completion percentage tick down a bit since last season. Wilson from a fantasy perspective is a tough player to rely on, as the Seahawks superior running game and lights out defense puts them in the unique situation where they don't need to rely solely on their quarterback to win games. Wilson is averaging just 24 pass attempts per game and is on pace for fewer than 4,000 yards. The rushing work does help to keep things interesting, but perhaps it's time to realize that Wilson may not be an automatic start week to week. He gets a Colts team that has been surprisingly solid against the pass this week and it may be time to consider replacing Wilson in your starting lineup in standard 10- and 12-team leagues.
Running Back
Over-achiever – Reggie Bush (DET)
18 carries, 139 yards, TD, 4 receptions (6 targets), 34 yards
Struggling with various injuries and feeling pressure from a rising talent behind him on the depth chart, Reggie Bush was in need of a big Week 4 when the Lions took on the Bears, and he delivered. Bush totaled 173 yards on 22 touches and also go into the end zone on a 37-yard touchdown rumble. Despite missing a game, Bush sits as the N0. 6 back according to ESPN.com standard scoring. He's an excellent fit for the Lions offense and Bush is finally settling in as the all-around stud that many projected out of college. If there was a worry that the up and coming Joique Bell would sneak a large chunk of the work away from Bush, that was quieted with Reggie's strong effort. Though it seems as if the next injury is always lurking, Bush has been rock solid when on the field over the past couple of season and there is little reason to doubt that will continue.
Under-achiever – Chris Johnson (TEN)
15 caries, 21 yards, 2 receptions (2 targets) 10 yards
Johnson gets the nod for a disappointing day, but to be fair, the Jets are a much tougher matchup than most think. Still, CJ simply has to begin to do more with the workload he is getting. After gaining just 21 yards on 15 carries, Johnson is averaging a pitiful 3.3 yards-per-attempt so far this season and with just four receptions for 12 yards and no scores, he really doesn't look anything like a player worthy of a second round selection. Things don't get any easier for Johnson in the short term, with a game against an improved Chiefs defense before traveling to Seattle and facing the 49ers leading into a Week 8 bye. There's always a chance for a big gain and, if you are in a deeper league, there may be few better options, but Johnson will be lucky to sniff the top-20 at the position over the next several weeks, even with the bye weeks kicking into full gear.
Wide Receiver
Over-achiever – Greg Jennings (MIN)
3 receptions (4 targets), 92 yards, 2 TDs
Minnesota's biggest off-season acquisition has been off to a painfully slow start as he is a quarterback Christian Ponder have been slow to develop a strong connection. Well, in Week 4, it was No Ponder, No Problem! As the Vikes traveled to London and grabbed a win over the reeling Pittsburgh Steelers, Matt Cassel stepped in for the injured Ponder and put a charge into the passing game. Cassel hooked up with Jennings on a 70 yards TD pass in the first quarter and just like that, it was Jennings' best fantasy day of the season. He added another touchdown later and finished with 3 catches for 92 yards and the pair of scores. The problem that faces fantasy owners at this point is that with the Vikings are heading into a bye and Ponder is likely to return in Week 6, we just cannot rely on a bump associated with the potential quarterback change. It was a nice day for Jennings, but it's difficult to expect more of the same while Christian Ponder remains in the starting role. Jennings will rank as a top-30 receiver during the bye weeks based on talent alone, but come playoff time, it will be hard to rely on the guy as more than a low-end WR3 until there is a permanent change in Minnesota.
Under-achiever – Mike Wallace (MIA)
3 receptions (7 targets), 24 yards
Wallace busted out with a big Week 2 in Miami, snagging nine balls for 115 yards and touchdown. In his three other starts in Miami, however, he has just six catches for 63 yards. Most regard Mike Wallace as an all-or-nothing threat week to week and this season, at least, he is proving that manta true. Wallace did let a potential big gainer slip through his hands on Monday night against the Saints simply could not get anything going in a game where Miami was in desperate for a big play. Wallace saw seven targets — second best on the team — but was inefficient on those targets.
Tight End
Over-achiever – Tony Gonzalez (ATL)
12 reception (14 targets), 149 yards, 2 TDs
After reeling in the Falcons first two passes of the day, Gonzo never looked back. He was up over one hundred yards with a score by the half and wrapped Week 4 with a position-leading 38 points in PPR formats — 12 catches on 14 targets for 149 yards and 2 TDs. Gonzalez entered the game as one of the most frustrating commodities at the position, catching just 11 balls for 93 yards and a touchdown over the first three weeks of the season. Matt Ryan looked his way early and often and fantasy owners were the big winners as the Falcons failed to get a W. While the banner day is a reminder of what Gonzalez is capable, he's got an unfavorable matchup against the Jets coming before the bye week. You have to figure that Roddy White becomes involved more heavily as his ankle continues to improve and Gonzo may be a boom or bust play as his true value is in his red zone dominance. We don't mind selling high on Tony G following his monster effort but it was nice to see the future-hall-of-famer shrug off the notion that he had finally hit a wall.
Under-achiever – Jason Witten (DAL)
5 receptions (10 targets), 43 yards
Witten put together a “fine” 5-for-43 line on Sunday, but there was opportunity for more with 10 targets against a San Diego defense that had been beat by the tight end in the pass. Owen Daniels and the Texans torched this group for 94 yards and three touchdowns in Week 1 and while the team has been more solid against opposing tight ends of late, Witten's performance is the lowest yardage output the Charger's have allowed to the position so far this year. Witten has been in single digits in standard scoring formats for three straight weeks and despite hitting pay-dirt twice in Week 1, looks again to more of a between the 20s safety net for Tony Romo than a real red zone threat. PPR owners will want to hang tough with Witten but in a standard league, he's a name you should be shopping.
“There is no organized mistreatment of Jews in Germany.”
-- Seattle Times editorial, March 28, 1933
In 1936, a heroic University of Washington crew team took on the Germans at the Olympics in Berlin. But the “Boys in the Boat” were not the only Seattleites in Adolph Hitler's capital city for the games. There were others who were soaking up Joseph Goebbels' propaganda and later bragged that they'd been close enough in the Olympic throngs to see the Fuhrer's “kind blue eyes.”
Much has been written about the Ku Klux Klan in the Northwest in the 1920s. There were also the fascist Silver Shirts of the 1930s, and the neo-Nazis from the 1980s — home-grown racists and anti-Semites who operated here, but were largely self-invented far-right fringe groups. During the 1930s, however, Seattle was home to, and a key pass-through point for, real Nazis who were sent here to win hearts and minds as a part of a strategy for world domination.
They sought to make friends, to find and cultivate potential supporters in the German American community. Seattle was a strategically important city for both potential allies and enemies. It was a major port connected by trade all over the globe, and especially close to Germany's ally Japan. It had Boeing, which was building state-of-the-art aircraft and, by the mid-1930s, war planes like the new B-17 “Flying Fortress.” The city also had a significant population of people of Northern European heritage, people with a personal and business interest in seeing a stable Europe and a healthy Germany.
The result: chapters of Seattle's history that clash with the city's progressive self-image — chapters that have largely been forgotten in a collective act of moving on. Yet these events help us understand our history, our international connections, our relationship to race, immigration, and civil liberties. This is the first in a series of stories that attempts to jumpstart our remembering.
It began with diplomats. In the 1920s, Germany opened a consular office here, an outpost of the German consulate in San Francisco, which represented the interests of Germans in the Western United States, from Utah to the West Coast, from the Mexican border to Alaska.
Walther Reinhardt, who had been consul in Seattle, drew international attention later for alleged spying. This clip is from the June 19, 1939 Nebraska State Journal.
The first consul in Seattle to represent Hitler's Germany, which came to power in 1933, was a gentleman of the old school — described as more of a Hindenburg man than one of Hitler's — an experienced diplomat named Dr. Walther Reinhardt. Reinhardt had been posted all over the world, in Montevideo, Rio De Janeiro, New York, Chicago, Zurich and Latvia. He was a steady presence with an academic air: He gave lectures on Goethe and in 1932 won a major award, the Strassburger prize, juried by Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann and Jakob Wasserman, for a biography he'd written of George Washington. By 1932, he was considered the distinguished dean of the local diplomatic corps.
When Hitler became German Chancellor, Reinhardt tried to give some dignity to the new Nazi regime, which wanted to project an aura of progressive dynamism and efficiency, an image of a government that was pulling Germany out of the post-war dumps and, perhaps, could teach the Depression-era United States a thing or two. Reinhardt downplayed Hitler's ambitions and said Germany's new boss only wanted peace. Looking back in 1941, after Germany's diplomats had been expelled from the U.S. prior to the war, the Seattle Times reflected that during Reinhardt's years in Seattle he “was feted at teas, musicales, cocktail parties and other affairs by Seattle residents.”
One of his main tasks was to soft-pedal and deny any anti-Jewish agenda of the Third Reich. It was not as if Hitler's anti-Semitism was unknown — he'd made his views perfectly clear in Mein Kampf, published in the mid-1920s. The Nazi rise to power was fraught with terrifying acts of brutality and terrorism. Still, these were often denied or attributed to Communist propaganda.
An infamous editorial in the Seattle Times on March 8, 1933, headlined “No Persecution,” suggests how mainstream minds were being molded exactly along the lines of the propaganda Reinhardt and his colleagues sought to promote. “There is no organized mistreatment of Jews in Germany,” the editorial began, citing assurances the U.S had received from the German ambassador. “The apprehensions and fears so feverishly propagated in this and other countries are officially reported groundless.”
The editorial went on to blame Communists, saying “every channel of Communistic propaganda is being employed to discredit the German government and embarrass its plans. The most careful scrutiny of all authentic and dependable news reports from Germany has failed to reveal any evidence that persecution of Jews was being tolerated, much less encouraged by the government.” The Times declared that tales of persecution were “an evil rumor,” concluding that “there has been no racial persecution in Germany and will be none.”
Philip Tworoger, a local lawyer and writer for Seattle's Jewish Transcript newspaper, was incredulous over the Times' cluelessness. “To say Hitler would not allow any organized persecution of the Jews indicates that the writer of the editorial is woefully ignorant of the history of German politics,” Tworoger wrote a rebuttal to the editorial that was published in April 1933. “Had he taken the trouble to inform himself he would have readily discovered from the files of The Seattle Times during the last six years that the Nazi[s], as the National Socialists are called, are organized on the principle of anti-Semitism. One of the plans of their ‘platform'… is their opposition to Jews, either to drive them out of Germany entirely or disenfranchise them and deprive them of their rights as citizens.”
Alongside Tworoger's letter, the Times — then under the direction of editor and publisher Clarence Blethen — decided to double down on its view that there was nothing German Jews should worry about, saying that it was too early to judge the Nazi regime. “The Times has expressed no high degree of confidence in Mr. Hitler; his rule is new and experimental, and the time to pass judgment has not arrived,” the editors wrote. “[T]hat it would deliberately arouse the hostility of the civilized world by ruthless persecution and outrage, such as Mr. Tworoger tries to depict, is incredible — just now unthinkable.”
Unthinkable? By April, 1933, when those words appeared in the Times, the Reichstag had been burned, Hitler had assumed dictatorial powers, Dachau concentration camp had been built, and the Nazis had staged a boycott of Jewish businesses. In fact, on the very day the Times declared state sanctioned anti-Semitism too be “unthinkable,” Jews were officially barred from public jobs, including teaching in schools and universities. These acts were followed that year by the creation of the Gestapo, the establishment of legal race definitions for Jews and “Aryans,” the banning Jews from land ownership, and stripping Polish Jews of citizenship, among other things. That was just Year One of the 1,000-year Reich.
So whose propaganda was the Seattle Times listening to? It tracked exactly the denials of Reich representative Reinhardt. In December, the German consul wrote a letter to the Jewish Transcript claiming that the newspaper was misrepresenting events in Germany. The paper had accused Reinhardt of “spreading anti-Semitism in speeches, and … using his association with leading Seattleites to whisper anti-Jewish falsehoods.”
But in his attempt to deny these points, Reinhardt unintentionally proved them to be true. In his letter to the Transcript, he related that he had visited Germany that summer with two unnamed American friends and that their impression was “that in no country in Europe they found less anti-Semitism than in Germany and that at no time in Germany less anti-Semitism was prevailing than now.” He went on to explain that restrictions placed on Jews were for their own good and had generated a more friendly attitude toward them by the German people. “Restrictions — yes! But no persecution, no atrocities,” said the toast of Seattle's foreign service.
No longer whispering anti-Jewish falsehoods, Reinhardt was getting them published in a Jewish newspaper.
Next: How the Nazis charmed Seattle
HTC announced the Rezound just last week, but it appears we might already know its successor: a PocketNow tipster leaked images of what could be the HTC Edge, and it's a beast. The Edge will reportedly have a quad-core, 1.5GHz Tegra 3 processor and 1GB of RAM, to go along with a 4.7-inch display with 720p resolution, the same 8-megapixel, f/2.2 camera we've seen on the Nokia Lumia 800 and the HTC Amaze 4G, Beats Audio, and HTC's ubiquitous Sense skin. It sounds a lot like the Rezound, actually, but with a larger screen and a lot more horsepower.
PocketNow reports it will be out in the first half of next year, but didn't offer anything related to pricing or carrier availability. Looks like the Rezound just lost some of its luster — would you still buy one, knowing what could be around the corner?
Correction: An earlier version of this article said that two journalists working in Libya, Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, had been reportedly killed in an artillery attack. It remains unclear how the journalists were killed, although they are believed to have come under attack by mortars or rocket-propelled grenades.
The United States and its allies have entered a new stage of involvement in Libya, sending assistance and advisers directly to opposition military forces, which have been unable to break Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi's stranglehold over much of the country despite help from NATO airstrikes.
France and Italy said Wednesday that they would join Britain in dispatching military advisers to assist the inexperienced and disorganized rebel army, primarily in tactics and logistics. President Obama authorized sending $25 million worth of nonlethal equipment, including body armor, tents, uniforms and vehicles.
The assistance appeared to stretch the definition of the “civilian protection” mandate contained in last month's U.N. resolution authorizing foreign intervention in Libya. The allies said their efforts were indirectly achieving that objective, because the rebel force was best-positioned on the ground to protect Libyans from attacks — or the threat of attacks — by Gaddafi loyalists.
The rebel-held western Libyan city of Misurata continued to be the focus of the fighting. Among those killed in the violence were photographers Tim Hetherington, a British American, and American Chris Hondros, reportedly from an attack by Gaddafi forces, and two other Western journalists were wounded. NATO said its warplanes struck government targets on the outskirts of the besieged city, as well as around Tripoli, the capital.
The arrival of European military advisers and U.S. uniforms is unlikely to rapidly change the trajectory of the conflict, however, and NATO and its Arab partners in the Libya operation continue to count on their economic and diplomatic war of attrition against Gaddafi paying off in the end.
“We are dealing with a set of imperfect options,” a senior administration official said, noting that the measure of success is not “where things stand” but “where they would have stood had we done nothing.” The NATO airstrikes and a no-fly zone enforced by NATO and Arab countries “have essentially frozen the battle space in terms of the advance of Gaddafi's forces,” he said, and “if you work all the other levers, you can make time work against Gaddafi.”
The official emphasized that Obama has no intention of sending U.S. ground forces — including noncombat military advisers — to Libya. But the administration's attempts to firmly limit its involvement have also contributed to an image of disarray within NATO.
A senior European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing the Americans, said that Obama's eagerness to turn over command of the Libyan air operation to NATO late last month, and the withdrawal of U.S. fighter planes from ground-strike missions, had undermined the strength of their united front against Gaddafi.
Although U.S. military officials have said that American strike aircraft remain “available” to NATO commanders should they request it, the senior administration official indicated that agreement would not be automatic.
“We would assess any requests,” the official said.
In a feisty response to any suggestion that the U.S. move to the back seat had undermined the NATO campaign, Vice President Biden said the alliance was perfectly capable of handling the air attack mission itself.
“It is bizarre to suggest that NATO and the rest of the world lacks the capacity to deal with Libya — it does not,” Biden said in an interview with the Financial Times.
“Occasionally other countries lack the will,” he said, “but this is not about capacity.”
Biden said U.S. resources were better spent trying to guide Egypt's transition toward democracy. He denied that U.S. public reluctance to become deeply involved in another conflict in the Muslim world had anything to do with Obama's decisions.
“This is about our strategic interest and it is not based upon a situation of what can the traffic bear politically at home,” Biden said. “The traffic can bear politically more in Libya,” he said, because “everybody knows [Gaddafi] is a bad guy.”
But as the situation in Libya has continued without resolution, popular disapproval of the president's handling of the situation has shot up 15 percentage points, from 34 to 49, since mid-March, shining a light on the political risks Obama faces on the issue amid a host of domestic problems, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Among political independents, disapproval jumped to 51 percent.
Fifty-six percent of those polled said they agreed the United States should participate in the NATO-led international coalition; most of those said they wanted the level of U.S. participation to remain “about the same.” Most of those who supported participation appeared to agree with Biden's assessment of Gaddafi, with 58 percent saying the goal of the operation ought to be getting rid of him.
France and Italy have recognized the opposition Transition National Council (TNC) as Libya's legitimate government, and Britain, France and Italy have had civilian and military personnel on the ground at rebel headquarters in the eastern city of Benghazi for some time. But the new teams being sent were described as professionals capable of training rebel officers and organizing a more efficient command network for the ground war. Each country is expected to field at least 10 advisers.
France has also agreed to escalate the airstrikes being carried out by NATO. French President Nicolas Sarkozy met Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil in Paris on Wednesday.
Although NATO is in command of the U.N.-authorized operation in Libya, different countries have agreed to different missions. Only six NATO members — France, Britain, Canada, Belgium, Denmark and Norway — are participating in the airstrikes against Libyan government forces on the ground. Others — along with non-NATO nations, including some Arab countries — are contributing aircraft to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya but have declined to participate in strikes. A third group is enforcing an arms embargo with air and sea patrols outside Libyan territory.
Those sending advisers or other assistance to the rebel forces are doing so as individual nations, in coordination with but outside the NATO command structure.
The three sending trainers have publicly ruled out sending ground forces. “The rebels themselves are afraid of being accused by other Arab countries of having allowed ‘crusaders' on their land,” said an Italian official who was not authorized to discuss the issue on the record.
Qatar, one of several Arab countries whose planes are participating in the no-fly-zone enforcement, is also reportedly providing military equipment directly to the rebels, including weapons. “They're sort of freelancing . . . throwing in money in a lot of different and odd ways,” including helping to finance a satellite television station to counter Gaddafi's control of domestic media, said a senior congressional aide briefed on the operations.
Obama administration officials said their comfort level with the rebel council had grown in recent weeks, after high-level meetings with its leaders and direct contact by a U.S. diplomatic mission sent to Benghazi.
“Whether there are people in Libya who may have more extremist or nefarious agendas, that is something we watch very carefully,” the senior administration official said in reference to suggestions of possible al-Qaeda involvement. “We don't believe that the organized opposition, represented by the TNC, reflects that agenda.”

Advertisement A Palestinian man has driven a bulldozer into a bus and several cars in Jerusalem, killing three people, before being shot dead. Dozens of people were hurt, at least seven critically, in the rampage on Jaffa Road, in the city centre. A police officer shot the driver of the bulldozer dead after a struggle in the vehicle's cab. Police said the attacker, aged 30, was from east Jerusalem, with no known affiliations to militant groups. See detailed map of the area They named him as Hussam Dwayat, and said officers had been gathering evidence at his address in the Sur Baher neighbourhood. Police said Hussam Dwayat had no known ties to militant groups The BBC's Tim Franks, who witnessed the attack, said that within a few minutes a stretch of Jerusalem's city centre had been turned into a blood-soaked mess. From his office window, our correspondent says he saw the bulldozer ram a bus again and again until it flipped onto its side. He says he ran out into the street where the bulldozer had left in its wake cars and taxis skewed across the road, some crushed, their occupants still inside. Israeli police say the attacker was working for a construction firm laying the foundations for a new railway system. 'Natural' response Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the BBC that an initial inquiry indicated the attacker had been acting alone. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called the incident a terrorist attack, and condemned it as "an act of senseless murderous violence".
Eyewitness: The BBC's Tim Franks BBC witnesses bloodshed In pictures: Bulldozer attack An aide to the Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas, said the attack was an attempt to wreck peace negotiations, and urged a restrained response from Israel. The Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which controls Gaza and is maintaining a fragile truce with Israel, denied responsibility. But Hamas added that it was a "natural" response to "a continued aggression against our people in the West Bank and Jerusalem". Cabin struggle The bulldozer, which was heading towards the city's largest open-air market, upended a bus and ran over several cars. One eyewitness told the BBC: "I saw [the bulldozer driver] crashing cars and going into the bus... He wanted to kill as many as he could." Another eyewitness, Yaakov Ashkenazi, an 18-year-old seminary student, told the Associated Press news agency: "I saw the bulldozer smash [a] car with its shovel. He smashed the guy sitting in the driver's seat." MAJOR JERUSALEM ATTACKS March 2008
Gunman kills eight at west Jerusalem religious college 2004
Three suicide attacks, one on a bus, kill a total of 20 people 2003
Four suicide bombings in buses and markets kill a total of 55 people A security guard from a nearby bank told our correspondent that he had shot the driver, bringing the bulldozer to a halt. But then the vehicle suddenly started down the road again. At one point, our correspondent saw two or three men inside the vehicle's cabin, struggling with the driver and causing the cabin to shake violently. One of the men, a police officer who arrived on the scene by motorbike, described how he dealt with the attacker. "As he was driving I climbed the tractor stairs... I also shot him with two bullets, and made sure he was neutralised - and that was the end of the incident," Eli Mizrahi told AP. Attacks by Palestinian militants in Jerusalem have been a rare occurrence in recent years, with none of their trademark suicide bombings since September 2004. The last deadly attack was in March this year when a gunman killed eight students in a seminary before he was shot dead. 1. Palestinian man driving a bulldozer begins his rampage down Jaffa Road in West Jerusalem, hitting several vehicles.
2. Travelling towards the Mahane Yehuda market, he rams a passenger bus several times before it overturns.
3. The bulldozer is eventually brought to a halt after the driver is shot following a struggle in the cab. At least three people are killed and dozens injured, some of them seriously.

TRUMP BLASTS IDIOT GOP LEADERS=> Focus on Tax Reform, Healthcare– Not Ethics Watchdog!
With all the work ahead to Make America Great Again Republican leaders in Congress announced Monday they would weaken the Independent Ethics Board and put it under lawmakers' control.
Of course, the liberal media seized on this opportunity to attack Republicans.
USA Today reported:
One day before the new Congress convenes, House Republicans voted Monday night to rein in an independent ethics office that investigates potential wrongdoing by lawmakers. The move guts a major piece of an ethics overhaul Congress undertook after several high-profile scandals sent lobbyist Jack Abramoff and others to federal prison. The independent Office of Congressional Ethics, launched in 2008 to address concerns that the lawmaker-run House Ethics Committee failed to adequately police members of Congress, now would be subject to oversight by the House Ethics Committee, under the proposed rules package adopted by Republican lawmakers. The new rules also would bar investigators from reviewing anonymous complaints against lawmakers. The Office of Congressional Ethics, known as OCE, would be renamed the “Office of Congressional Complaint Review.”
Leave it to idiot Republicans to toss the Democrat-media complex red meat to attack the incoming GOP government.
Later this morning PEOTUS Trump blasted the Republicans for this idiotic move.
Trump told the lawmakers to focus on the real issues affecting Americans!
Focus, idiots!
With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017
……..may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017
#MAGA bitches!
Thailand continues its slow-motion political implosion. The prime minister has been ousted and a new election has been scheduled for July 20, but the latter will settle nothing unless traditional ruling elites are willing to accept a government run by their opponents. If not, the country risks a violent explosion.
Bangkok's politics have long leaned authoritarian. Once ruled by an absolute monarchy, Thailand has periodically suffered under military rule. Democracy finally re-emerged two decades ago. Nevertheless, the 1997 constitution created institutions of establishment control, such as the Constitutional Court. The monarchy retains outsize (though indirect) influence, and is generally allied with top business and political leaders.
But in 2001, telecommunications executive Thaksin Shinawatra disrupted the system. Campaigning as a populist, he won the votes of Thailand's neglected rural poor to become prime minister. Those accustomed to ruling were horrified.
Thaksin won again in 2005. Instead of figuring out how to better appeal to the popular majority, his opponents organized the so-called People's Alliance for Democracy which launched protests to topple his government. The resulting confrontation gave the military an excuse to oust the traveling Thaksin in 2006. The military regime tried him in absentia for alleged corruption and rewrote the constitution before calling new elections.
However, Thaksin's successor party won a plurality and dominated the resulting coalition.
Thaksin's opponents, who predominated in Bangkok, launched a wave of demonstrations, blocked Bangkok streets, besieged parliament, surrounded government buildings, and even took over Bangkok's international airport. The security agencies refused to defend the government and the opposition-controlled courts ousted parliamentarians, including one prime minister, on dubious grounds. Establishment interests then pressured coalition partners to flip to the so-called Democrat Party (DP), which had not won an election since 1992.
When United Front for Democracy (so-called “Red Shirt”) Thaksin supporters flooded into Bangkok to protest the de facto coup, DP Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva no longer supported the people's right to protest. The military conveniently decided that order must be maintained. The government killed scores and injured thousands of demonstrators, and imprisoned numerous opposition leaders.
But Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister, and her Pheu Thai party won an absolute majority in the 2011 election. So the PAD morphed into the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), led by former DP Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, one of those responsible for the 2010 killings. He demanded elimination of the “Thaksin regime” and organized mobs, which worked full-time to drive Yingluck from office. Their tactics, designed to prevent the government from functioning, reflected a mindset reminiscent of Benito Mussolini and his infamous Black Shirts. Recently Suthep called on the military to “stand by the people” and stage a coup.
In response, Prime Minister Yingluck called new elections, which further angered the opposition. The DP complained that the February poll would be “unfair.” More honestly, opposition activists admitted that they would lose. DP parliamentarian Theptai Seanapong said, “We cannot beat them.” Suthep turned his mobs loose on Election Day, blocking many Thais from voting. His attacks left enough constituencies unfilled to prevent the new parliament from taking office.
In March, the Constitutional Court effectively backed Suthep by invalidating the entire election because its opponents had prevented Thais from voting. Yingluck remained caretaker prime minister with only limited power to govern. Now the Constitutional Court has ousted her over the attempted reassignment of a government official. Suthep and his allies hope to use this ruling to force the installation of a compliant, unelected prime minister.
But leaders of the Red Shirts promised to respond violently to any judicial coup. In March, a former military officer and top Red Shirt threatened to march on the capital with 200,000 armed “guards” if Yingluck was deposed.
In the past, the widely respected king was able to transcend party factions, but he is aged and largely disengaged, while other members of the court have backed Suthep. In contrast, the Crown Prince is thought to lean toward Thaksin.
The political battle is complex, deep-seated, emotional, and personal. Thaksin has been justifiably criticized, but his opponents generate more heat than light. For instance, his corruption conviction, in absentia by a compliant court under a military regime, proves little. One can criticize Thaksin's populist approach, but political parties around the world commonly adopt a “tax and tax, spend and spend” election strategy. Columnist H.L. Mencken once said an election was an “advance auction sale of stolen goods.” For all the faults of Thaksin's universal health care program, for instance, it hardly seemed “corrupt.” Perhaps his worst offense was attempting to bloodily suppress the drug trade.
Similarly, Yingluck's expensive rice support program may be unwise—it has well-nigh bankrupted the government—but also is not corrupt in any classic sense. Anyway, wealthy urban elites who benefited from past Thai government policies have little credibility faulting the rural poor for favoring their interests when voting.
Suthep denounced Yingluck as a tool of her brother, but even if she acted as his agent—his involvement in policy making is real but its extent is unknown—that does not justify the opposition's Black Shirt tactics. Many Thais supported her because they believed she represented his views.
Ultimately, Suthep and his supporters are most interested in gaining power for themselves. A woman from the south told the New York Times: “We are the middle class, we are educated and we know best.” Some Thaksin opponents suggest abandoning “one man, one vote”. Others forthrightly advocate authoritarian rule or even an absolutist monarchy. Suthep wants to rig the political system through “reform” implemented by an unelected “People's Council.”
The frustration of Thaksin's supporters is palpable. Several parliamentarians elected in February—whose selection then was voided by the court—visited Geneva where they spoke with Secretary General of the International Parliamentary Union Anders Johnsson, United Nations human rights officials, and NGO members. The Thai delegation found much sympathy over the obvious assault on democracy, but those outside the country have only limited ability to influence events.
So far, Thailand's generals have demonstrated no interest in taking control again. Richard Werly of Le Temps observed that the military “tried before and realizes that it can take power but can't resolve the underlying problems.” Moreover, generals cannot count on the loyalty of soldiers drawn from rural areas, as well as younger officers promoted under Thaksin and Yingluck.
The only real solution can come from the political process. For instance, a Thaksin family withdrawal from politics would help ease political tensions. However, that would be more likely if Thaksin did not fear, with good cause, being targeted by his enemies. Werly suggested that Thaksin may feel he “needs to be involved to protect his investment...otherwise they will come after his money.”
It is even more essential to exclude those who have been employing violence for their own political ends, most notably Suthep and Abhisit. Their role is far more malign. The latter, at least, recently raised the possibility of stepping back as part of his new reform proposal, though the latter also would rig the electoral process in the elite's favor. Neither should be trusted with power in the future.
Constitutional reform also might ease social conflict. Reducing the central government's reach and devolving authority to provinces would reduce the winner-takes-all character of Thai politics, something proposed last year by a group of academics and local officials. Rural and urban populations might more easily live together if their futures were not subject to dictates from the other.
Moreover, the Thai people need to rethink the role of politics. A 2004 survey found that respondents leaned “toward majoritarian rather than strictly representative government.” At the same time, they were concerned about “the effect of diverse political views and the threat to harmony of the community posed by politically active groups.” Middle class voters seemed particularly willing to sacrifice democratic values for economic development. Yet social peace and economic growth are more likely to result from a representative, decentralized political system with only limited authority.
There is much to criticize about Thai politicians on all sides. However, it is putative authoritarians like Suthep who most risk plunging Thai society into violence. While there's still time, the elites should pull their country back from the brink.

Clocks around the world are routinely adjusted to keep them ticking in synchrony with the rising and setting of the Sun – but is that effort just a waste of time? That was the issue under debate this week by the World Radiocommunication Assembly of the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva, Switzerland.
Delegates from about 150 countries discussed whether to stop adding a second — called a leap second — to calendars every year or so, a practice that keeps atomic clocks in step with Earth's rotation and the position of the Sun in the sky. But participants reached a state of confusion, rather than consensus, so the decision about the leap-second's fate has been deferred to 2015.
Since 1972, international time zones have been defined against Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is based on signals averaged from around 400 atomic clocks. Leap seconds are added in at a rate of about one minute every 60-90 years. But nations disagree about whether the second is actually needed
Opening Thursday's debate was the US delegate, Paul Najarian, Director of Telecommunications and Standards at the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union (America). Najarian pointed out some of the technical headaches that leap seconds cause: they cannot be preprogrammed into software, for example, because they are typically announced only six months in advance by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service in Frankfurt, Germany. Introducing them manually raises the risk of inconsistencies between computer systems, which can cause them to crash. To avoid the safety hazards associated with losing crucial time-keeping signals, most satellite navigation systems already maintain their own internal clocks, and they don't use the leap second.
But the British delegation leapt to the leap-second's defence. “The United Kingdom is strongly opposed to coming up with a new conception of time, without good reason,” says Peter Whibberley, a physicist at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington.
Both sides had a handful of backers from other nations, but many of the delegates — a mixture of government represenatives and technical experts — were simply not prepared for the proposal, and said they needed more information before deciding.
Deadlock
The issue has been under discussion for at least 10 years, but representatives from many countries have not attended the meetings, says Elisa Felicitas Arias, France's delegate and director of the Time Department at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Sèvres, who backed the proposal for abolition.
The lack of consensus has meant that the leap second has been given a stay of execution to allow all countries to get up to speed. The plan is now to vote on the issue at the next meeting of the World Radiocommunication Conference meeting in 2015. In the interim, the proposal may be revised to include a compromise, such as a ‘leap hour' that could be implemented every few centuries, says Włodzimierz Lewandowski, a physicist at the BIPM.
Whibberley hopes that countries will use the extra time to consult with experts and the public on the social implications of axing the leap second. Arias, however, thinks that cultural considerations lie beyond the World Radiocommunication Assembly's purview and that the three-year grace period would be better spent inviting astronomers, geodesy experts and metrologists to formally contribute to a revised proposal.
Lewandowski thinks that the abolitionists will ultimately prevail. “We already have people stationed out in space — does it make sense that they use an imperfect clock based on a wobbly planet?”, he asks. “Even if it takes another 50 years, people will come to see that we don't need the leap second. It is just a matter of time.”
Ascalonian Catacombs - First Experiences!
Today I decided to venture into Guild Wars 2's first dungeon Ascalonian Catacombs. This dungeon requires you to be at least level 30 and if you are above level 30 it will de-level you to meet the dungeons requirement. I entered this dungeon with a group of guildies that I was in Team Speak with, all of which are veterans to this genre and know what they are doing.
When entering the dungeons story mode for the first time you are greeted with a prologue cinematic that will give you background to the Catacombs. Once past the intro, you will then talk with the NPC at the start to begin the dungeon. After initiated, the doors open and you begin your journey through Ascalonian Catacombs where you will be met with a ton of crypts to sort through till the first boss appears. This whole sequence was fun, enjoyable, and a challenge, but after the first boss, the challenge turns into the broken mess that is Ascalonian Catacombs.
After the first boss I was quite pleased with the dungeon, however, after that the dungeon implodes into a huge overpowered mess that you almost have to be lucky to make it through. The trash mobs in this dungeon, when grouped up, could almost pass as a raid boss in any MMO I have ever played because they are THAT strong. Not only that, but they are so strong that I found my self as a Thief getting one shot even with good gear and even at RANGE. A few more bosses, wipes and hours later, we ended up getting to the Two Lovers boss sequence where you have to separate the two lovers in order to not get annihilated. You can do this by using the boulders on the ground, or kiting one away from the other. Once separated, you then begin dpsing one of them down, then the other after that. Very simple mechanic, however, because of the overpowered mobs that this dungeon has, it wasn't so easy.
After wiping about 25+ times, my guildies grew frustrated and decided to call it quits till this dungeon gets fixed, some of which said that this dungeon is WAY harder than any other dungeon in the game. I found this sad because I have never once made it through this dungeon, no matter what group comp I have, the dungeon fares to powerful for an average to good group to get through. I also found that the rewards were bad as well. I wouldn't have minded the challenge if the rewards weren't blues or stuff crappier than what I have. I was all for the difficulty of Vanilla WoW because at the end of boss fights you got amazing gear and rewards. This dungeon lacks that in my opinion because for the time spent doing this dungeon, you could have gotten the same rewards if not more just questing.
In the end I cant do a "proper" review of this dungeon because the fact I have not 100% completed it, but what I can tell you is it is harder than any dungeon I have ever experienced and also lacks a decent experience gain to make it worthy of your time. Also, for a dungeon to be in "Story" mode and be more challenging than then Vanilla WoW raids that were notorious for their challenge, this dungeon is a broken overpowered mess that Arena Net needs to fix so people can actually experience what looks to be a fun and interesting dungeon. Till then, I recommend you don't try this dungeon out, because all you will gain is more deaths on your /deaths count.
***Keep in mind this was only really my first time through considering the first time I did Catacombs my party left after the first boss, so who knows, could be doing something wrong, but I still stand by my opinion that the dungeon at this point is to hard for the first dungeon in the game.***
Question Of The Article: Did you guys experience Ascalonian Catacombs yet? And if you did, what was your experience like? Do you feel this dungeon needs to be nerfed? Why or why not?

Taipei, Nov. 2 (CNA) Bitcoin is illegal in Taiwan, said Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Tseng Ming-chung (曾銘宗) on Monday after kidnappers in Taiwan tried to collect a ransom through the virtual currency late last month.
Asked at a legislative hearing if the virtual currency can be used in Taiwan, Tseng said it was illegal and pledged that the FSC would work with the country's central bank and police to crack down any illegal act.
The FSC will also publish a statement jointly with the central bank to inform other countries of such regulations, he said.
Bitcoin emerged in 2009 as a low-cost way of sending money electronically without third parties. It is not controlled by any country or banking authority.
In late October, a Hong Kong tycoon who had been kidnapped and held hostage for more than a month by a gang in Taiwan was asked to pay a ransom through bitcoin.
The central bank said last year that bitcoin was a highly speculative virtual product and lacked a mechanism to protect transactions.

Events: The Nationalist Front will be hosting two demonstrations in Middle Tennessee on Saturday, October 28th. We will hold the first demonstration in Shelbyville, TN in the morning. Then we will we pack up, eat lunch and travel to Murfreesboro, TN for our second demonstration in the afternoon. Finally, we will have various private social gatherings in the area in the evening where we will continue to socialize and everyone will have a chance to get to know each other better.
Date: Saturday, October 28th
Locations: Shelbyville, TN and Murfreesboro, TN.
The Shelbyville demonstration will take place at the intersection of U.S. Highway 231 and Lane Parkway. The Nationalist Front will be at the southwest corner while the opposition will be gathered at the northwest corner of this intersection. Please remember this.
“Counterprotesters will enter Public Square via South Church Street and South Maple Street only.” Presumably, they will be on the south side of the square and we will be on the north side. We're waiting for clarification on this. The Murfreesboro demonstration will take place in the Public Square Presumably, they will be on the south side of the square and we will be on the north side. We're waiting for clarification on this.
Times: Shelbyville, 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM and Murfreesboro, 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM.
Speakers: Mike Enoch, Matthew Heimbach, Dr. Michael Hill, Dillon Hopper, Sacco Vandal, Jeff Schoep, Anti-Communist Action.
Participating Organizations: League of the South, Traditionalist Worker's Party, National Socialist Movement, Vanguard America, Anti-Communist Action, The Right Stuff.
Fliers: Please share these on Facebook, Twitter, GAB and other social media. We also ask you to create new ones like with UTR in C'ville.
Meetup Locations: The meetup location in Shelbyville will be announced at 9:30 AM by @occdissent on Twitter in order to deter Antifa disruption. We will shuttle from there as a group to the rally point of the White Lives Matter demonstration and back to the meetup point afterwards. We will follow the same procedure with our demonstration in Murfreesboro.
Description: The purpose of the White Lives Matter rallies will be to protest the ongoing problem of refugee resettlement in Middle Tennessee and to draw attention to the recent Emanuel Samson church shooting in Antioch and the way this explosive story has been buried by the national media. The tragic events in Antioch, which was retaliation for the Dylann Roof shooting in Charleston, illustrated that the national media only cares about pushing its false narrative of White racism and black victimhood.
We also want to express our anger at the Trump administration which recently took Sudan off the travel ban list the day of the Antioch church shooting. It also followed up by announcing an “America First Refugee Program” which means dumping 45,000 refugees a year in places like Middle Tennessee while not saying a word when a Sudanese refugee who failed to assimilate goes on a rampage. The Trump administration has also failed to build the border wall and is working with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to pass a new version of the DREAM Act amnesty. Finally, we want to discuss the state of our movement and how we will move forward from here.
Objectives: Draw national attention to the Emanuel Samson church shooting. Foster greater unity and cohesion within our own movement. Turn the page on Charlottesville.
Bring: We do not expect the White Lives Matter rallies in Shelbyville or Murfreesboro to become another Charlottesville. That's not in our interest. It certainly isn't in the interest of Shelbyville or Murfreesboro. We desire to hold two peaceful demonstrations. The Nationalist Front chose to hold this event in Middle Tennessee in order to AVOID any type of clash with violent Antifa protesters. We expect them to be restrained and separated as they were in Pikeville, KY.
Do Not Bring: Shelbyville and Murfreesboro have provided clarification Shelbyville and Murfreesboro have provided clarification of which items you are not allowed to bring to the #WhiteLivesMatter demonstrations . These include masks, firearms, knives or any type of weapon as well as flag poles, sticks and clubs. Read through the list carefully and be prepared to be searched at designated entry points.
DO NOT BRING FIREARMS
Flags: This is a unity event within our movement. Each Nationalist Front organization will bring its own flag. Some people will use the Confederate Battle Flag. You are free to bring an American Flag. We would like to keep the styles and arguments over flags to a minimum. We will enter and exit as a group and This is a unity event within our movement. Each Nationalist Front organization will bring its own flag. Some people will use the Confederate Battle Flag. You are free to bring an American Flag. We would like to keep the styles and arguments over flags to a minimum. We will enter and exit as a group and exclude any actors or plants from our permitted area . In light of the ban on flag poles, we don't recommend you bring any additional flags.
Attire: Each organization within the Nationalist Front has its own dress code for events. League of the South will be wearing Each organization within the Nationalist Front has its own dress code for events. League of the South will be wearing black LS polo shirts , khakis and black boots. Traditionalist Worker's Party will be dressed in black. NSM will be dressed in black. Vanguard America will be wearing white polo shirts and khakis. Anti-Communist Action will likely be wearing white polos and khakis.
If you are unaligned with any of these organizations, we ask gentlemen to wear something similar like some combination of a white or black polo and khakis. Ladies are asked to dress modestly. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out. Come to the White Lives Matter rallies to make a good impression. Don't come wearing shorts or flip flops or ragged jeans or anything of that nature.
Expectations: We want to host a HIGH ENERGY event. This will be an occasion to vent our anger and outrage and demonstrate we will not be closeted in our own country. Chants will include WHITE LIVES MATTER and BLOOD AND SOIL.
We are representing our movement in the public square and everyone who participates in these rallies will be expected to conduct themselves with that purpose in mind. Anyone who becomes disruptive or misbehaves will be asked by organizers to leave our permitted area.
Optics: We plan to show that we are a unified movement of diverse organizations who all agree that WHITE LIVES MATTER. In light of this, each organization will participate in these events as a cohesive unit under its own leader, and we will all stand shoulder to shoulder with our own optics, i.e., those with Confederate Battle Flags will be grouped together as will those with American flags.
Lodging: We encourage you to make hotel reservations in Murfreesboro or Nashville, TN. We won't be staying long in Shelbyville. This is a Middle Tennessee event.
Private Event: We will be hosting a private lunch gathering for anyone attending the White Lives Matter rally in Shelbyville. It will be a time to relax, socialize and enjoy the companionship of likeminded people in our movement after two hours of pro-White activism. We will be keeping the location of the private event a secret until after the Shelbyville demonstration. In the evening, we will disperse to private parties and will likely continue to socialize and enjoy recreation in the Nashville Metro Area.
See you in Middle Tennessee. Hail victory!

Quantification of the postprandial response
Comprehensive targeted metabolomics and proteomics analysis of the response to a postprandial challenge revealed major metabolic changes. Plasma concentrations versus time profiles were determined for 145 metabolites, 79 proteins and 7 clinical chemistry parameters. ANOVA revealed a significant time effect for 106 metabolites, 31 proteins and 5 clinical chemistry parameters. These 142 metabolites, plasma proteins and clinical chemistry parameters covered a broad range of biological processes, from energy metabolism including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins to regulatory processes and responses related to oxidative and inflammatory stress. These responses are described in detail below.
The 142 plasma parameters were clustered into 6 discrete postprandial response time courses. Various types of time courses were observed: rapid (maximum change in plasma concentration within 1–2 h) as well as slow (maximum response after 6 h) with both decreasing and increasing plasma concentrations. Figure shows these 6 different time course profiles and Supplemental Table 1 lists the metabolites and proteins grouped to these different time course profiles. The chemical structure of 11 of the 106 changed metabolites was not identified and these were therefore excluded from Table .
Table 1 n PCT (overlap fasting) Fasting Metabolites 145 18 (12) 48 Proteins 79 13 (3) 9 Clinical chemistry 7 0 1 Total plasma parameters 231 31 (14) 58 Open in a separate window
Glucose and carbohydrate metabolism The PCT (containing 30 energy percent (E%) carbohydrates) caused a temporary increase in plasma concentrations of glucose (cluster 1) and insulin (cluster 2). Similar responses were found for several metabolites associated with carbohydrate metabolism, such as sucrose, 4-deoxyglucose and citric acid cycle metabolites. Fructose and the gut hormones glucagon like protein 1-active (GLP1-active), protein YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) showed a similar time course to glucose (cluster 1 or cluster 2). Concentrations of the monosaccharides xylose and arabinose decreased over time in response to PCT (cluster 4). Insulin facilitates the transport of these sugars from blood across the cell membrane (Goldtein et al. 1953). Consistent with mannose being a non-insulin sensitive sugar, the plasma concentration of mannose increased at later time points after PCT (cluster 6). Apolipoprotein CIII had a similar response to the PCT as glucose. This response may also be controlled by insulin, because the apolipoprotein CIII (APOC3) promoter contains an insulin responsive element and insulin has been shown to downregulate APOC3 expression (Waterworth et al. 2003).
Amino acid metabolism Most plasma amino acids reacted very similarly to the PCT: a rapid increase which returns to baseline within 4–5 h (cluster 2, glutamic acid in cluster (1). These amino acids probably originated from proteins present in the PCT formulation (12 E% protein). Urea showed a cluster 1 profile, suggesting a surplus of amino acids that is transaminated and deaminated for the production of glucose, fatty acids or energy. The amino acid derivatives 3-methylhistidine and creatinine both originate from muscle (van Eijk et al. 1990; Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk 2000). Since these muscle metabolites showed a temporary plasma increase while the PCT contains dairy protein and no meat protein, these data suggest that the PCT also affects muscle metabolism.
Bone metabolism Plasma hydroxyproline (and methyl-hydroxyproline) concentrations decreased in response to PCT (cluster 4). Hydroxyproline is mainly present in collagen, and is a marker for bone turnover, suggesting that bone metabolism may be influenced during postprandial metabolism (Minisola et al. 1985). In cluster 4 cortisols, MMP2, TNFRII, VCAM1 and uric acid all play a role in bone turnover and osteoarthritis (Walsh and Henriksen 2010; Schett et al. 2009; Nowatzky et al. 2010). Mutations in MMP2 and TNFRII diminish bone resorption (Cawston and Young 2010; Riches and Ralston 2010). This corresponds with the fact that bone resorption is immediately reduced after food intake (Parfitt 2002).
Lipid and lipoprotein metabolism The PCT formulation is rich in lipids (59 E%). Total triglycerides, C10:0 free fatty acid, monoglycerides C16:0 and C18:1 levels rose immediately after intake (cluster 1), followed by slow increase in C12:0 and C14:0 free fatty acids (cluster 5). In the small intestine pancreatic lipases hydrolyse triglycerides into 2-monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids, which are re-esterified into triglycerides and liberated in the blood via chylomicrons. Fatty acids C10:0, C12:0 and C14:0 are poor substrates for re-esterification into triglycerides, because the specific medium-chain acyl-CoA synthase required for their activation is absent. Thus these fatty acids enter plasma directly as unesterified fatty acids (Frayn 2010). In addition, the monoglycerides 16:0 and 18:1 are released from chylomicrons during hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue. This process is stimulated by insulin (Wang and Eckel 2009), which also showed an immediate increase in response to the PCT. Plasma concentrations of longer free fatty acids (C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, arachidonic acid (C20:4)) and glycerol increased after a lag time (cluster 6). Insulin–immediately released after food intake- suppresses fat mobilization for energy production. In the late phase of the time course, adipose tissue triglycerides are likely to be hydrolyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase for beta-oxidation, promoting the observed increased plasma levels of these free fatty acids and glycerol. Interestingly, the essential n-3 free fatty acid C22:6 (DHA) showed a different response to the PCT (cluster 3), suggesting a DHA-specific metabolism. The plasma concentration of ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutanoic acid and acetonacetate) coincided with the availability of free fatty acids. The cholesterol concentration decreased in response to PCT with subsequent recovery (cluster 3). The major portion of plasma cholesterol is carried in LDL lipoprotein particles. Increased insulin levels lead to activation of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue, which in turn can lead to an increased clearance of lipoprotein particles and an inhibition of lipoprotein output from liver (Frayn 2010). Thus lowering of insulin and triglyceride levels at later time points may result in observed recovery of cholesterol levels (cluster 3). Apolipoprotein A1 showed a similar response as cholesterol, suggesting that plasma HDL particles showed similar behavior to LDL lipoprotein particles.
Endocrine metabolism Testosterone and progesterone decreased postprandially, together with their precursor cholesterol. Similarly, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), the main transport binding protein for sex steroid hormones, decreased with subsequent recovery in response to the PCT (cluster 3). In line with this it has been shown that insulin can decrease SHBG synthesis in the liver (Pugeat et al. 2010), while testosterone levels decrease postprandially in men, followed by recovery after 2–3 h (Habito and Ball 2001). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates the synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones which have an important role in the regulation of energy balance. Thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) is involved in the transport of thyroid hormones through blood. Both responded to the PCT with lower concentrations followed by a recovery (cluster 3), suggesting a decreased thyroid hormone production immediately after PCT. TSH concentrations have been reported to decrease immediately after ingestion of food (Kamat et al. 1995). Cortisol is known to affect intermediary metabolism (glucose, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism) by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, counteracting the insulin action. Cortisol has metabolic effects on several tissues including stimulation of fat mobilization in adipose tissue, stimulation of gluconeogenesis, inhibition of the uptake of glucose by muscle and enhanced catabolism of muscle (Frayn 2010). Plasma cortisol concentrations decreased linearly in response to the PCT. The postprandial decrease of plasma cortisol concentrations upon a high fat diet was observed before (Volek et al. 2001).
Energy metabolism The glycolysis intermediate pyruvate and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates citric acid and alpha-ketoglutaric acid showed temporary increased plasma levels upon PCT (cluster 2), whereas succinic acid showed only increased concentrations in the late phase of the time curve (cluster 6). This suggests that pyruvate, alpha-ketoglutarate and citric acid accumulate in the early phase and can not be efficiently metabolized for ATP conversion via TCA cycle, whereas succinic acid concentrations did not change in this early phase. The accumulation of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate probably originates from surplus dietary amino acids that can be converted to these metabolites. These observations suggest that the TCA cycle has reached its optimum capacity in the early phase and recovers 3 h after PCT. Plasma lactic acid showed linearly reduced concentrations (cluster 4), suggesting that ATP is solely aerobically produced in response to the PCT. The metabolite glycerol-3-phosphate is synthesized from glycerol and can be used as substrate for glycolysis. However, this metabolite accumulated in plasma (cluster 5), suggesting that there is a surplus of NADH and that the process of oxidative phosphorylation may have reached its maximum capacity (Overkamp et al. 2002, in yeast).
White Sands Testing New Laser Weapon System
The Phalanx is an air and missile-defense system used on nearly every ship in the fleet. Converted to be transported and fired from a trailer, it is also used by the Army under the name Centurion to provide defense from air and missile threats as well as defense against mortar and artillery attacks. Since it is also able to be used against small surface targets, the laser will be able to be used in peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions without drawing the kind of attention a cannon would.

White Sands Missile Range NM (SPX) Feb 06, 2009
White Sands Missile Range is testing a new weapon system known as the Laser Centurion Demonstrator. The system, developed by Raytheon, combines proven radar and threat-detection technology with the latest in laser weapons.
This demonstration model is intended to prove the capabilities and effectiveness of the new laser weapon as part of the Laser Area Defense Systems program, officials said.
The new laser system is designed to replace the 20mm cannon on the Navy's Phalanx system and the Army's Centurion system, according to Raytheon's Web site.
The integration of an advanced directed energy weapon into an existing conventional weapon system helps keep the system's costs down as well as allowing an easier transition from one system to another, officials said.
The Phalanx is an air and missile-defense system used on nearly every ship in the fleet. Converted to be transported and fired from a trailer, it is also used by the Army under the name Centurion to provide defense from air and missile threats as well as defense against mortar and artillery attacks.
As an upgrade to the Phalanx and Centurion, the laser system is a program that is jointly funded by the Navy and Army. Other services are also interested in the laser itself for possible integration into other weapon systems.
"Directed energy is getting more and more prevalent in weapon systems," said Col. Bruce Lewis, White Sands Test Center commander.
Initial tests with the demonstrator have been positive. The laser has proven capable of rapidly penetrating armor plating even when not at full power, and system setup has been very easy.
"We are excited to be testing system capabilities by shooting down mortar rounds in the coming weeks," said Sal Rodriguez, senior flight test engineer with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division, Sands Missile Range detachment. Rodriguez also thanked all the members of Team White Sands who have supported the program while it prepares to test the system.
The Laser Centurion will fill the same role as the conventional cannon-equipped version while providing a commander with more options and capabilities, officials said. The laser-based system will still be able to engage targets like mortars, rockets, and missiles, but without the drawbacks of limited ammunition.
Also, since the laser does not use any kind of solid shot like the cannon, it can be used to better defend populated areas without the fear of the "20mm shower" that conventional air-defense guns cause when their bullets fall back to earth.
Since it is also able to be used against small surface targets, the laser will be able to be used in peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions without drawing the kind of attention a cannon would.
"At (short range) it's a nice deterrent, and without the big bang of a gun," said Lt. Shawn Mitchell, assistant officer in charge of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division's WSMR detachment.
Unlike previous laser systems of this kind that used chemical reactions to generate the necessary power for the laser, the Laser Centurion uses a solid-state laser that can run off any appropriately powerful source of electricity.
"It's like the difference between an electric car and a gas-burning car... this is a very green system," said Dan McMaster, a program manager from Raytheon. This makes the Laser Centurion a very flexible weapon system as it will be able to run off land-based generators and power supplies just as well as it will off of a ship's reactor.
After two weeks of sustained activism by faculty, students, and alumni at the University of Virginia, the Board of Visitors reinstated President Teresa Sullivan by unanimous vote. As I wrote last week, she had resigned after the Rector of the Board—Helen Dragas—covertly gathered votes to force a resignation. This sparked a backlash that consumed the U.Va community, and forced Dragas to back down from her previous position–as evidenced by the fact that she also voted to reinstate Sullivan.
The takeaway, for U.Va at least, is that Teresa Sullivan has far more power and support than she did at the beginning of this debacle. If she wants to take the University in a new direction, she has—for now at least—the necessary political capital. By contrast, the Board of Visitors has taken a tremendous political hit. Even after Dragas leaves her rectorship (it ends on July 1), the Board will have to work with students, faculty, and donors to rebuild its position and authority.
One last thing. For as much as this is good news for the University, it's important to remember the extent to which this was representative of a national drive to corporatize higher education. At a rally for Sullivan this past Sunday, I saw a sign that listed other Virginia schools—William & Mary, James Madison University, Old Dominion University, etc.—and asked if they were next. The fact of the matter is that they are, along with many others. The problems and challenges in higher education still exist, and there are still many people who want to make privatization the norm for public schooling.
Misao Okawa is one of only five people alive – all women – born in the 19th century when Queen Victoria was on the throne
Plenty of sleep and a varied diet are the secrets to a long and healthy life, according to Misao Okawa, the world's oldest person, who celebrated her 116th birthday on Wednesday.
Okawa, who became the world's oldest person last June following the death at 116 of fellow Japanese Jiroemon Kimura, was given a cake with just three candles at her nursing home in Osaka – one for each figure in her age.
Okawa is one of only five people alive – all women – confirmed as having been born in the 19th century.
While she has spoken of her love mackerel sushi, which she eats at least once a month, Okawa isn't particularly fastidious when it comes to food.
"She eats sushi, her favourite, and whatever she likes – beef stew, spaghetti, or sashimi – every day," said an employee of the nursing home where Okawa has lived for the past 18 years.
"She always says the secret to living a long time is to eat a good meal and relax," the employee added. For Okawa, that means an uninterrupted eight hours' sleep every night.
In 1898, the year Okawa was born, the Spanish-American war was in its infancy and Queen Victoria was still on the British throne. Okawa married in 1919 but her husband died in 1931, more than eight decades ago. Their marriage produced three children, two of whom are still alive and in their 90s. Okawa has four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
Okawa has dealt with the media attention with incredulity.
When notified that she was in line to become the world's oldest woman last year, she reportedly said: "Have I really lived that long?"
The centenarian, one of about 24 Japanese alive who have passed the 110-year milestone, claims she has never been ill, and quickly recovered after breaking her leg in a fall at the age of 102. "She is in good shape, and is even still gaining weight," the nursing home employee said.
Experts attribute Japan's enviable longevity statistics to its traditional low-fat diet, affordable health care and decent pensions.
Other studies point to the advantages of staying active and spending time with family and friends.
Japan was home to more than 54,000 centenarians last year and its elderly population will soar in the coming decades. About a quarter of its 127 million people are already aged 65 or over, but that is expected to swell to about 40% by the middle of the century.
The Boundaries of Artificial Emotional Intelligence Leigh Alexander Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 31, 2017

I'm told I should prepare for the day artificial intelligence takes my job. This will leave me either destitute and rootless or overwhelmed by a plenitude of time and existential terror, depending on whom you ask. It's apparently time to consider what kind of work only humans can do, and frantically reorient ourselves toward those roles — lest we be left standing helplessly, as if at the end of some game of robot musical chairs. Emotional labor is a form of work less often considered in these automated future projections. Perhaps this is because the work it takes to smile at a rude customer or to manage their distress is intangible, difficult to quantify and monetize. In no small part, performances of support go unnoticed in the same way a lot of “women's work” does—though in recent years talk of its hidden costs has gained momentum in the labor inequality conversation. Thanks to the wonderful tools of digital society, we are theoretically able to give and receive more support than ever. Social media platforms let us learn more about one another and stay in constant touch, so we tend to assume this knowledge promotes empathy and connectedness. We feel more educated about structural inequality problems and global humanitarian issues. Yet who's doing the actual work of teaching? For many people, myself included, the modern technology and social media infrastructure has not actually made life easier. In fact, it's facilitated demand for even more emotional labor without any extra money in our paychecks. And as is the case with almost all work, it ends up being the least privileged people who are doing the heavy lifting. On Twitter, it's mostly women of color, risking harassment every time they speak up, who are the ones regularly offering lessons on race, intersectionality, or politics. If you've “gotten woke” as a result of spending time on social media, it was because of the thankless labor of volunteers serving this content, usually under stress (and for the profit of the platforms they use). I try to do this work, too, where appropriate. But emotional labor can also be intimate, encompassing the energy women are disproportionately socialized to spend ameliorating interpersonal conflicts. In the Facebook age, the daily challenges of all my friends' lives are always right in front of me. It gets hard to pretend like I haven't seen a call for help or support, even several, in the middle of my real-work day—whose boundaries are starting to dissolve. I can somehow lose hours in supportive dialogue with someone who isn't a particularly close friend, or in internet arguments standing up for my values against strangers I'll never meet. “I spend too much time on social media” is a privileged complaint in the grand scheme, to be sure. But all in all, my friends and I are increasingly ending our days wired and anxious, tired as if we'd labored for money, yet feeling emptier. The percentage of women choosing to skip motherhood has doubled since the 1970s, and while there are all kinds of generational and economic factors involved, I wonder: What if women today just feel like we're all out of love? In the 1960s, Joseph Weizenbaum created a therapist chatbot named ELIZA at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab. While he never meant to design a “real” AI therapist, Weizenbaum was surprised to see his secretary growing attached, turning to ELIZA voluntarily as the AI offered “patients” gentle prompts about their conditions, or mirrored their responses back. What had been intended as a satire of the smoke and mirrors behind this simulacrum of empathy (and, to an extent, certain therapeutic techniques) became a research highway into the human psyche. Weizenbaum couldn't have predicted that so many people would maintain an interest in ELIZA, that they'd feel a bond with her, that they would spend the next decades typing their secrets to her into a glowing screen. That unexpected attachment provides an important clue about our hopes for AI — that we want very much to turn to it for emotional labor, and that we're willing to do so no matter how poorly it reciprocates. We've long been thinking about how AI might be able to take over some of this work, whether it's tending to the mysteries of the human heart or the existential, daily burdens of an unjust society. Robot therapists, butlers, maids, nurses, and sex dolls are familiar components of the techno-utopian future fantasy, where dutiful machines perform all our undesirable chores, while we enjoy lives of leisure. But these familiar dynamics may actually be about nurturance and care just as much, and perhaps even more, than they are about service or labor. I saw my first robotic toy in 1985. It was a stuffed bear called Teddy Ruxpin, who read aloud to children thanks to books on cassettes inserted into its belly. In TV ads, Teddy hung out with latchkey children after school while their parents were, presumably, out climbing the ladders and skyscrapers of the era; or he lovingly read or sang them to sleep at night, his fuzzy jaw clacking away in time. In that same year, the fourth Rocky film released, in which Sylvester Stallone's titular boxer—now wealthy—infamously gifts his old friend Paulie a talking robot butler. It was peak-1980s, this idea that economic plentitude could create a stairway straight to the future of technology and leisure. The actual robot that appeared in the film, Sico, was created to help autistic children with communication before it fell prey to the allure of Hollywood. In the movie, Paulie somehow retrofits the functionally complex, male-voiced servant into a female-voiced social companion, of which he finally grows fond (“She loves me!” he exclaims).
Perhaps for children, care, like a gentle toy bear in overalls, can be genderless. When it comes to the world of adults, we still default to viewing both service and nurturance as predominantly female areas. Why the AI of today so frequently employs a woman's voice or persona is the subject of reams of research, discussion, and speculation. It's been said that we associate service or submissiveness with women, that a predominantly male tech consumer conflates luxury products with sex, or that everyone supposedly just responds better to the sound of a voice they consider female. Azuma Hikari, “Japan's answer to Alexa,” is a virtual assistant that tells her master she misses him when he's gone, that she can't wait for him to get home. That sort of thing is not only uncomfortably tangled up with sex and submissiveness, but also with companionship, care, and the drip of daily interactions that constitute emotional work in the digital age. We want our robots to be women because we already expect to get our emotional labor from women. I fancy myself someone who's focused on dismantling patriarchy and all of that, but even I feel a little let down when I follow the absurd urge to say “thank you” to Alexa — and she doesn't respond. Of course, Alexa only listens to my voice when she hears me say her “wake word,” otherwise she might as well be snooping on me all the time. But the interaction still feels sterile without that extra flourish of labor designed to reassure me that I have not been an imposition, that my needs are normal. I don't just want her to play a song or tell me the weather; I want her to make me feel good about asking, too. This particular urge might not be conducive to a healthy society. In an article titled “The Danger of Outsourcing Emotional Labor to Robots,” Christine Rosen cites research warning of the ways that letting artificial beings maintain our comfort zones might homogenize the vocabulary of care — in other words, if a robot can smile politely on command, do we stop appreciating what it sometimes costs a human to do the same? All outsourcing risks a devaluation of local labor — we may empathize even less, see our emotional intelligence regress, or create strange new social messages about who deserves (or can afford) care. If our virtual assistants and emotional laborers are all turning out to be soothing, female-voiced AI, will it close certain gaps for human women? Or will it ratify them? Complicating these questions is the fact that robots, virtual assistants, productivity software, email tone checkers, data-crunching algorithms, and anything similar under the sun are all now being plowed en masse under the marquee of “AI,” when many are just crude algorithms or pattern-matching software. Google hopes a bot can help identify toxic internet comments, while Facebook is testing an AI that can spot users who may be suicidal and offer options to intervene. As Ian Bogost says when he writes on the new meaninglessness of AI as a term, these solutions are wildly imperfect and easily abused, artificial but not particularly intelligent. Still, there are key areas of life online where AI (or software, or algorithms) show great potential to intervene. Portland-based creative technology developer Feel Train collaborated with notable Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson on a Twitter bot called @staywokebot, which is designed to offer supportive messages to Black activists and shoulder some of the strain of facing down social media noise; eventually it aims to act as a front line for 101-level questions like “why don't all lives matter?” The bot can already tell people how to contact their local representatives, and one goal for the future sees it providing answers to complex but common questions about justice, relieving activists from demands to continually engage in those conversations themselves. Then there's the dystopian horror that content moderators face on platforms like Facebook, chronicled in especially gruesome detail in this 2014 Wired article. It may not look like tiring or skillful work, but wading through a constant march of genitalia, child pornography, and beheadings certainly takes its toll. Currently, algorithms can make only blunt force guesses about the tone or context of a joke, phrase, or image—so human intuition still matters a lot. The problem, then, is that a real person has to look at every potentially violating a bit of content, weighing the merit of each one, day in and day out. Here, an intelligent machine could feasibly form at least a first defense, so that human moderators perhaps might only have to study subtler and more nuanced situations. Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris is chief creative officer of London, U.K.-based Spirit AI, a software company focused on using AI technology to develop more humane and plausible character interactions — both inside videogame worlds and outside them, in the fraught area of community management. Game communities are one of many complicated spaces where people want to test boundaries just as much as they want to find cultural places that feel safe to them. I reached out to her about one of her company's tools, Ally, which aims to make all kinds of social platforms feel safer and more inclusive for all.
A second indie music festival has imploded and left consumers footing the bill. Just weeks after the Instagram-tastic collapse of Fyre Festival, a second destination event has gone full meltdown, with several major music players working to contain the damage.
Pemberton Music Festival is officially bust, leaving in its wake an uncertainty for independently-promoted festivals just as the summer season is getting underway. The crash of the British Columbia event, which takes place on a private ranch north of Whistler, was worsened by a last-minute decision by Pemberton owners to declare bankruptcy and refuse to immediately refund $6 million worth of tickets to 18,000 fans. The move sparked outrage at a major booking agency, with the company's head of music calling for a criminal investigation.
“This is fraud, pure and simple,” WME partner Marc Geiger told me in an interview Friday for Billboard. “The only difference between Pemberton and Fyre is that Pemberton sold their event with trees instead of supermodels.”
The collapse was startling because unlike Fyre Festival, Pemberton was ticketed by a major ticketing company and promoted by Huka Entertainment, a well-known indie outfit in New Orleans. Sure the disastrous Fyre Festival was something to be laughed at — a tone-deaf and impossible-to-deliver concert organized by a washed-up rapper and a pathological liar — but for Pemberton, the companies involved (like Ticketfly) were well-known entities who had handled hundreds of music festivals.
Just two weeks after going on sale, the investors who controlled the festival — landowners Jeremy Turner and Amanda Girling along with and Canadian mining executives Jim Dales and Stephane Lescure — had millions in ticket sales advanced to them by Ticketfly. About a week later, the same festival owners quietly resigned from one of the two shell companies that owned the Pemberton festival. A week after that, a second shell company — Pemberton Music Festival LP — declared bankruptcy and instructed fans to apply for refunds for their $270-plus tickets as unsecured creditors with no guarantees they'd see a dollar (or in this case, a loonie).
According to Canadian filings, the festival's owners structured the bankruptcy so that private companies they owned were first in line as secured creditors, with claims equaling $3.6 million, paid out before thousands of fans and potentially dozens of vendors would get a crack at any money left over.
Hoping to stem the damage to their reputation, festival promoters AJ Niland and Evan Harrison with Huka have tried to get out in front of the festival crash, arguing they had fought the bankruptcy plan and are actively pursuing options to get fans refunded. But to many people's surprise, the men had slowly ceded control of the event over to the festival's owners and quietly resigned from the Pemberton Festival LP in early April.
Geiger and executives with Ticketfly said they didn't know that Niland and Harrison had exited the Pemberton LP until after Thursday's bankruptcy. Hoping to contain the damage, Geiger and other interested parties are planning to challenge the festival's four principal owners in court and are considering a sell-off of Huka's assets, including the Tortuga Festival in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to recover the money if necessary. There's also a plan to go after the 274-acre Sunstone Ranch, which has hosted the festival four times since 2008. The festival site is currently listed for sale with a price tag of $16.8 million.
The crash could not have come at a worse-time for Ticketfly, whose parent company Pandora is trying to entice SiriusXM into a potential purchase after a $150 million lifeline from private-equity firm KKR & Co. If that doesn't happen, rumors swirl that Pandora might sell Ticketfly, less than two years after purchasing the company in a blockbuster $335-million deal.
Having a $6 million liability on its books is not a great look for Ticketfly CEO Andrew Dreskin, and the festival's three missing owners seem to be worsening the situation by encouraging fans to chargeback tickets to their credit cards, potentially sticking Ticketfly with millions of dollars worth of disputed charges. One bankruptcy document on Ernst and Young's website seems to endorse chargebacks, telling fans:
Refunds may be available to ticketholders if tickets were purchased using a credit card. As each bank and credit card issuer have their own specific policies, ticketholders are to contact their bank or credit card issuer directly to determine whether a refund can be obtained.
That type of behavior represents fraud, Geiger explained, warning the festival's investors: “I'm coming after you.”
“This is just gross to me,” he said. “These guys are declaring bankruptcy, but none of them are actually bankrupt. Their shell company is bankrupt. And now they want fans to pay the price. That's not bankruptcy. That's fraud.”
Who Are These People?
According to Canadian records, the companies that own and control Pemberton Music Festival include the landowners as well as a Canadian mining executive and his French business partner. Much of what we know about the three is thanks to the reporting of Pemberton news writer Bob Mackin from thebreaker.news — we've piggybacked on some of the work he's already done to paint a picture of these four individuals.
Amanda Girling, CEO of Janspec
Janspec owns the Sunstone Group, which owns the Sunstone Ranch where the festival is held. Janspec also owns the Oak Tree Manor assisted living home in Nanaimo, B.C. The Turner family owns Janspec and Girling previously served as Executive Director of the Turner Foundation, which provides water resources for the community of Mtito Andei in Kenya. Her background includes time at accounting firm Ersnt & Young, which is the overseeing the Pemberton bankruptcy.
Jeremy Turner, family owns Janspec and Sunstone Ranch Group
We don't know much about the Turner family yet except that they operate several businesses in Pemberton. The Turners are also kicking around a plan to develop part of Sunstone Ranch into “a future community recreation site” that “has the potential to become an epicenter for learning, living and recreation.” A website advertising the site has been removed, but this generic banner ad is still floating around the web.
Jim Dales, Investor and Mining Company President
Dales is the founder and partner of the corporate-overlord sounding Procon, a multi-national mining company with subsidiaries in China. Procon is involved in large diamond and gold mining operations in Canada. According to Mackin, Procon “has a subcontract on the $9 billion Site C dam project to “manage the silica exposure control program, the mine rescue program, and underground safety program” for Peace River Hydro Partners.” He holds dual degrees in Civil and Mining Engineering and is responsible for the management “of all project contracts including all field operations and client management,” according to the Procon's company website.
Stéphane Lescure, Partner at Proconseil
Proconseil is a consulting division of Procon based in France. Besides providing big-ticket business advice to European C-suite types, Lescure is also a well known investor who has funded startups like Sequoiasoft, a hotel and restaurant technology platform and Nice startup Travelae. He also likes to post entreprenuer videos like this one that roughly translates into titles like “The benefits of a stand-alone company.”
Artificial intelligence just overcame a new hurdle: learning to play Go, a game thousand of times more complex than chess, well enough to beat the greatest human player at his own game. Twice.
AlphaGo, an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind, is two games into a six-day, five-game match with Lee Sedol, the world's best Go player. And so far, AlphaGo has won both games — meaning that if Sedol is going to triumph, he has to stage a quick comeback.
Go, a two-player game, is played on a board with 361 squares, with an unlimited supply of white and black game pieces, called stones. Players arrange the stones on the board to create "territories" by marking off parts of the board game, and can capture their opponent's pieces by surrounding them. The player with the most territory wins.
Although the rules are relatively simple, the number of possible combinations is nearly infinite — there are more ways to arrange the pieces on the board than there are atoms in the universe.
The computer's victory shocked Sedol. But it's also astounded experts, who thought that teaching computers to play Go well enough to beat a champion like Sedol would take another decade. AlphaGo did it by studying millions of games, just as Google's algorithms learn to identify photos by looking at millions of similar ones.
The next match between AlphaGo and Sedol is Friday at 11 pm Eastern time. It's being live-streamed online.

No pun intended.

Dawkins, the Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, is arguably the world's best-known atheist.
Have you ever wondered why an atheist believes what he/she does? Richard Dawkins wants you to know why he is an atheist. Dawkins, the Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, is arguably the world's best-known atheist. He is not just any old atheist, however; he is atheism's great televangelist.
This year, he has been on the road throughout the UK and the US, appearing on talk shows and news interviews. He had two hours of prime-time television on the UK's Channel 4 network in January 2006. In these programs (entitled The Root of All Evil?), Dawkins sought to persuade his audience of the importance of his case—that not only should his audience not believe in God, but they should actively oppose any form of religion. (I reviewed these programs previously.) It was not only evangelical Christians who were critical of the programs. Writing in The Guardian, a left-leaning UK newspaper not noted for its support of creationists, Madeleine Bunting described the documentaries as “intellectually lazy polemic.”1
With the publication of his new book, The God Delusion, we now have an expanded version of his atheist manifesto. One would have hoped that he would have taken the opportunity to present a more intellectually rigorous case. Indeed, some may have been afraid of opening the book, in case the sheer weight of evidence might have destroyed their faith. For my part, I was looking forward to encountering an intellectual challenge—but sadly I was to be disappointed. The book suffers from the same intellectual laziness as the television programs.
Dawkins' arguments, far from having intellectual clout, mostly fall back on, “The argument will be so familiar, I needn't document it further.” Dawkins' paucity of argument is best illustrated by his ignorance of Scripture and by his faulty logic.
Ignorance of Scripture
Although The God Delusion is ostensibly about all religions, in practice it is about Christianity—and evangelical Christianity in particular is the focus of Dawkins' attacks. In his arguments against Christianity, he makes much use of Scripture. However, his use of Scripture is highly suspect. It appears that he has done very little research into the structure or history of the Bible. This is unsurprising, as almost every statement he makes on the Bible reveals that he has not approached it with an open mind.
The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction. (p. 31)
Statements like this are loaded with prejudice. He goes on to make several more specific accusations about the character of God. Most of his accusations are unsubstantiated. Some are due to Dawkins' own presuppositions about what is right and wrong (for example, his accusation that God is “homophobic”), some are due to his failure to have read the history leading up to particular events, and some are just plain wrong. That an intelligent man like Dawkins was so skimpy on his biblical research is incredible. One is reminded of Paul's quotation of the Psalms in 1 Corinthians 3:20 : “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”
We need to study a few examples of this lack of research regarding Scripture.
The historical evidence that Jesus claimed any sort of divine status is minimal. (p. 92)
Some of the most striking evidence is not immediately obvious in English translation, but would have stood out like a sore thumb to contemporaries. One of the clearest of the many times Jesus claimed to be God is His use of the divine name, “I AM.”
This divine name was told to Moses, when he met with God (who appeared as a burning bush).
And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you'.” ( Exodus 3:14 )
The Hebrew word translated here as I AM is often transliterated into English as YHWH. The Name is usually translated as LORD, with four capital letters.
Jesus used the style “I am … ” very frequently, most notably in John 10 .
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep. ( John 10:11 )
Apart from the fact that God is frequently referred to as the Shepherd, the people listening to Jesus would have been very familiar with the words of Psalm 23 .
The Lord is my shepherd. ( Psalm 23:1 )
Remembering that the word Lord is basically the same as I AM, the people listening to Jesus were in no doubt that He was claiming to be God. This is not a code, or an obscure point. Jesus knew that His words were reminiscent of Psalm 23 and so did the people. This is why in John 10:31 , the people had picked up stones and were ready to stone Jesus, accusing Him of blasphemy. Jesus' claim to be divine was obvious to them.
Notice Dawkins' misunderstanding of the lineage of Jesus.
In any case, if Jesus really was born of a virgin, Joseph's ancestry is irrelevant and cannot be used to fulfill, on Jesus' behalf, the Old Testament prophecy that the Messiah should be descended from David. (p. 95)
Luke's gospel has a genealogy in chapter 3 , which most commentators agree is the descent of Jesus through Mary. Thus Jesus traces back an actual blood relationship, through Mary to David, via David's son Nathan. Jesus also traces an adoptive relationship through his father Joseph, through the kings, to David, via David's son Solomon (in Matthew 1 ). Thus both Joseph and Mary are descended from David, but Jesus' bloodline is only through Mary—He truly is the “seed of the woman” prophesied in Genesis 3:15 . However, Jesus could inherit from Joseph, even if He was not a blood descendent. Therefore, Joseph's lineage is important, because, through Joseph, Jesus inherits the kingship. None of this is very difficult to research, and Dawkins should have done so.
Space does not permit further examination of his errors in handling Scripture, save to mention that the dreadful account of the horrific events of Judges 19 are not recorded to imply God's approval, as Dawkins thinks. Rather, they show the depths to which God's people are able to stoop when they reject Him. Given that history is usually written by the victors, it is noteworthy that the Bible contains unflattering accounts of the transgressions of His people. This is evidence in support of the truthfulness of Scripture.
Poor Logic
It must also be said that Dawkins' arguments show surprisingly poor logic. Examine this extraordinary sentence:
Although Jesus probably existed, reputable biblical scholars do not in general regard the New Testament (and obviously not the Old Testament) as a reliable record of what actually happened in history, and I shall not consider the Bible further as evidence for any kind of deity. (p. 97)
Look first at the use of the word “probably” in “Although Jesus probably existed.” Why is Dawkins doubting this fact? There is no good reason to question that Jesus existed. It is illogical to add the word “probably.”
Look next at the use of the word “reputable.” What is a “reputable biblical scholar”? The test of reputation has been left undone by Dawkins, but presumably, a “reputable biblical scholar” is one who agrees with Dawkins' attempts to rubbish the Bible. Logic would require defining this term. Such people can be found, though whether the adjective “reputable” is appropriate for such people is a matter of opinion. We define a “reputable biblical scholar” as one who at least approaches the Bible with respect, preferably believing it to be the inspired, inerrant and authoritative word of God, from the very first verse.
Thirdly, why is it “obvious” that the Old Testament should not be regarded as reliable? He has clearly not read detailed apologetics of Scriptural inerrancy, such as that provided by Brian Edwards in his masterly book, Nothing But The Truth. That is again down to his presupposition—that evolution is true, therefore Genesis is wrong, therefore evolution is true. Merely making a statement, or using the word “obvious,” does not make a statement true! Just from these three points, we see that there is no logical reason given by Dawkins for rejecting the use of the Bible as evidence.
Articles on the use of logic are easy to find on the website. An important element in the use of logic is to recognise logical fallacies. Dawkins has committed several of these.
Circular reasoning
This fallacy occurs when your presupposition is actually what you wish to prove. Look at this example:
Creative intelligences, being evolved, necessarily arrive late in the universe, and therefore cannot be responsible for designing it. (p. 31)
The logical fallacy is breathtaking. Evolution is first assumed, in order to prove that evolution is true rather than intelligent design: “creative intelligences, being evolved … .” It is Dawkins' presupposition that all creative intelligences have evolved. It is an idea not supported by, for example, information science.
Ad hominem
This sort of fallacy involves attacking the opponent instead of the argument. In the UK, this is referred to as “playing the man instead of the ball”—a soccer reference, implying that the tackler has deliberately aimed to kick his opponent, rather than attempting to kick the ball.
There are several examples of this, such as a particularly nasty attack on a schoolteacher, who happens to be a creationist. Notice, on page 95, how Dawkins describes certain American educational establishments:
He moved up the hierarchy of American universities, from rock bottom at the ‘Moody Bible Institute', through Wheaton College (a little bit higher on the scale, but still the alma mater of Billy Graham) to Princeton in the world-beating class at the top. (p. 95)
Why are the three institutions arranged hierarchically? What is the basis for Dawkins' assessment of standards at each place? He doesn't say, but we assume that it has to do with belief in the Bible. Why is it implied that, because they number Billy Graham among their alumni, this is a negative for Wheaton College? [Editor's note: It is ironic that Dawkins would have a problem with Wheaton College, since it does not adhere to a plain interpretation of Genesis.]
Straw men
The well-known “straw man” logical fallacy occurs when the debater misrepresents (often by oversimplifying) his or her opponent's position for them, then argues against this invented position, rather than against the actual arguments of the opponent. An example of this is seen in the mocking tone used as he attempts to dismiss arguments based on intelligent design.
I [insert own name] am personally unable to think of any way in which [insert biological phenomenon] could have been built up step by step. Therefore it is irreducibly complex. That means it is designed.
Although Dawkins uses this argument frequently, it is a complete misrepresentation of the intelligent design position. A biological mechanism is not labeled as irreducibly complex because it is complicated and the labeler cannot think how it could have evolved. It is so labeled because it can be shown that it is not possible for it to have evolved.
Inconsistency
It is noteworthy that Dawkins' arguments are very inconsistent. For example, Dawkins frequently returns to a criticism of the so-called “God of the gaps” approach that uses the supernatural to explain what science cannot currently explain. Compare that attitude with his own, on page 132, where he comments on gaps in evolutionary knowledge:
A lot more work needs to be done, of course, and I'm sure it will be.
In Dawkins' view, it is inappropriate for a scientist to appeal to the Creator to make a scientific explanation, even if that explanation is logically sound. On the other hand, Dawkins writes as though it is perfectly acceptable, when faced with dilemmas that evolution cannot explain, to suppose that an evolutionary scientist will have a naturalistic answer someday, even if the science is consistent with a biblical approach. Such double standards allow Dawkins to self-justify poor logic, while refusing to acknowledge the strength of those who oppose him.
Conclusion
Christians have nothing to fear from The God Delusion. Far from being a reasoned argument for atheism, it is a rant. It would be appropriate for Christians to be aware of the principal arguments of the book, and how they are countered. Maybe one day an atheistic book will emerge that has more intellectual rigour, but even an intellectually rigorous apology for atheism would not concern us for God is a God of wisdom and reason. Time and again we find that a belief in the inerrancy of Scripture is not just a doctrinal statement, it is an intellectually satisfying position to take. But Dawkins' new book is weak, even by atheist standards. We note that Dawkins is now planning to send atheist material to government schools in the UK. That might be a good opportunity for British school pupils to exercise their critical thinking!
There have long been rumours of multiple simcards, friendly call centres and dodgy backroom jury arrangements. But in an increasingly corruptible world, how can we be sure that our winner is genuinely the continent's favourite song? Roy Delaney explores the possible new futures for Eurovision voting.
Nobody expected Russia to pull such a tactical masterstroke. We'd pictured teams of crack musical scientists and their authoritarian space robots laser cutting the Russian entry in a sterile lab and putting a host of potential singers through a punishing bootcamp in Siberia. But instead they've kept it simple and gone straight for the heartstrings. Whatever we might happen to think about her nation's intentions, Yulia Samoylova's Eurovision entry is still a contender to win this year's Contest, and we shouldn't go cancelling those speculative hotel bookings in Sochi just yet.
Yes, for barring the unexpected discovery of the next Abba, or a song so utterly delightful that the whole continent instantly falls in love with it (cough ‘Portugal' cough), this Contest could still very easily be Russia's to lose. Well, if it can, ahem, allegedly influence the result of the American election and have a hand in the dismantling of the European Union then the country is surely able to sort out the result of a funny little singing show in its favour? After all, what bigger coup would it be to win the show in the backyard of their most troublesome neighbour?
Much has been made of the effects of proximity and diaspora voting in the Eurovision Song Contest, but in all reality these effects can only ever be negligible across a continent packed with so many countries. In this increasingly technological world, the ability to tweak results to guarantee the result that you want can surely only be a couple of Contests away. And when that happens, the EBU will have to fundamentally review the way that it gathers votes, as the propaganda possibilities that come attached to winning the Song Contest are getting more attractive by the day.
Of course, we used our Russian cousins as an example for purely comedic means, but there are many countries for whom a win at Eurovision could become a massively important event. Whether it be for political gain, to highlight a burgeoning tourist trade, or for any manner of other lucrative commercial reasons, a Eurovision victory could reap massive rewards for a nation, and for those with the inclination and the wherewithal, it's a tempting target.
For many years, talk of the bulk purchase of simcards has muttered around in the darker corners of the press halls, and rumours of entire call centres being employed to do nothing but vote are now being voiced. With the emergence of VPN facilities, it's never been more easy to vote for your own country from your own country. I've long been an advocate of keeping the results of the Eurovision Song Contest in the hands of those people who value them the most – the viewers. But it's becoming more apparent by the day that this system is more liable than ever to deliberate sabotage and sneaky tricks.
What About Tweaking The Jury?
“So why not make it a 100% jury vote,” we hear many of the old school purists shout. But hold on there for a moment – isn't this existing system already wracked with fundamental flaws? For a start, taking the result out of the hands of the people and throw it to the mercy of a small panel of self-appointed experts is likely to stretch the already growing disconnect between the viewers and the show. It's almost as if we're telling them that they can't be trusted to select a winner, and that these serious looking people on the panels know better than them. That's never a good thing when you're trying to appeal to an audience and let them feel ownership over a result.
It's also achingly apparent that the current five-person system is no longer fit for purpose. For a start they are infinitely more corruptible than the current televoting system, and the opinions of just a single forthright member in the jury room can seriously cloud the judgement of all the other panel members. On top of this, they are voting for all the songs in comparison to each other, rather than voting for the single song that they like the best. So the compromise winner from this averaged out system is almost always going to jar with the more instantly populist feel of the song that tops the public vote. There are also issues to be raised about how truly independent any judge can be. Consider country clumps like the Balkans, the Baltics, and many of the ex-Soviet states, where the music industry is small, and many of the people within it have careers that cross many borders. How can these people then be truly independent?
Indeed, over the last few years there have been suspect voting results such that a number of jury votes have had to be suspended, while many more are had the appearance of ‘not being proper'.
It's clear that things will have to change sooner rather than later, so what can we do about it? Many people have posited the idea of having larger juries, made up of a broad range of people of many ages and walks of life. This would indeed be more representative than the current small groups, but begs the question of how you would organise them. Gathering them together in one large hall could prove expensive, and the possibilities of one or more interested parties plying them with gifts and lobbying them for votes is still a distinct possibility unless the highest possible security is enacted. But even then is that preferable to the current system?
More Public Voices?
Or maybe there's the Sanremo model. For many years they've been dividing their votes between the good folks at home, a broad ranging expert panel, and the opinions of the folks in the press room. But more recently they've entertained the concept of the demoscopic poll, whereby a sample of 300 music fans with a broad range of tastes and buying habits are able to vote for their favourites from their own homes via an electronic voting system. Imagine if this was rolled out across the continent, and instant voting was possible. It could cut down collating time, and surely rid us of at least ten minutes of tiresome local folk dancing in the intervals. But again, with a bit of thought it could become eminently corruptible, as vigilant hackers could crack the system, or the names of panelists get out, resulting in them being showered with gifts and benefits in much the same way as the old Top 40 chart return shops from the past. But despite this, it's a concept that's surely worth exploring.
And while we're at the electronics, why not have a look at giving the crowd in the hall a say? After all, they are considered to be the people with the closest connection to the contest – surely they could be trusted to contribute to the result? But how would they vote? Well if those technical wizards can give out enough glittery bracelets to effect a dazzling co-ordinated light show in the stalls, it's surely not beyond their wit to include some manner of feedback facility on those units that could assist in helping the people down the front tell us who their faves were.
Again, it's a lovely utopian idea, but one that could lead to single countries bulk buying tickets in order to try and influence the votes – and is that the kind of crowd that we want in front of the camera? As much as we always moan about the inflatable Israeli hammers and greek flags, we'd miss them if they weren't there and replaced by a phalanx of sombre-faced drones waiting for the magic moment they can press their buttons and collect their five pounds (or whatever other convertible currency they prefer).
And if not that, then perhaps the Eurovision app could have a direct voting component – although the homogenous final result table of this year's public vote at the Melfest suggest that this method also requires a little work. There are so many potential new methods to consider, but each of them seems riddled with potential problems.
Is There An Answer In The Forest?
So how else can we devise a voting system that can get the most accurate, generally accepted result in this infinitely more corruptible world? My feeling is that we are going to have to look at methods of combining all of the above into some kind of coherent whole. The organisers are surely never going to totally do away with televoting, for two principal reasons. One is that it still offers the public some sense of physical connection to the show if they are still, in theory at least, able to help select a winner. The other is a little more financial. Would the EBU really want to do away with the extra slice of revenue that the phone votes bring in?
So perhaps fractionalising the votes into a variety of distinctly different sources could lessen the effects of unscrupulous agencies attempting to influence the results. A blend of televotes, extended juries, demoscopic voting and fan choices may make the adding uptime a little more protracted and complicated, but it could also temporarily halt the march of the dodgy jury and the call centre influenced televote.
One thing is for certain. Someone high up in the echelons of the EBU is going to have to take a long hard look at this very soon, or things could start to get very unsettlingly predictable around here. Oh, and just out of interest, you can still get 25/1 on a Russian win with some bookies. It might be worth a speculative cover bet, just in case, like…

Close your eyes and think about today. Think about the United States of America. Think about the state of education. Think about the state of job creation. Think about the state of mind we are in. Think about what our country might look like in 20 years. Now think about and wonder why and who and when and what it's going to take for Detroit not to turn into a slum. What is it going to take for my niece and her friends to have the best education? And your nephew to graduate and not just get a job, but have a career?
I'm writing this on my laptop and you're probably reading it on your phone or tablet, and none of the stuff we are actually buying "regardless" of a recession is made in America. Technology is recession proof and most kids are not dreaming of being programmers, scientists or engineers. The ones that are, do not get the spotlight or attention. Instead, they are looked at as geeks or uncool, when in actuality technology is the only thing that is cool today. iPhones, Android devices, Facebook, Twitter (all tech), all exciting. This is why I put my own money, passion and time to take Dean Kamen's FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and turn it into a back-to-school TV special.
Dean Kamen invited me to visit his office at DEKA Research and to also attend a FIRST gathering of high school kids who get together to build robots. Who knew there was an international competition of teenage robot builders? After meeting Dean and these kids, I saw the promise that these bright young minds. I am convinced that the 13 year-olds building robots and competing at FIRST will be the business and tech leaders of tomorrow. I am convinced these kids will invent new medical devices, communications and consumer electronics gear, rockets, renewable energy sources and high mileage cars -- the things that can help America better compete in a global economy.
You've probably noticed that it is "back-to-school" season and families are gearing up to send their kids back in to classrooms. The backpacks, lunch kits, clothe and school supplies are essential. But the most important back-to-school item on every family's checklist does not come in a package or have a price tag.
This is the gift of curiosity for students to learn and explore. Encouragement and positive reinforcement from parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents, neighbors and friends is what it takes to spark this curiosity.
I created the i.am.scholarship that includes high school academic mentoring with the i.am.scholarship College Track program. I'm also a co-founder and supporter of the Peapod Foundation with The Black Eyed Peas. These academic and creative scholarship support programs are young and growing, but are not yet able to reach every student that needs encouragement and support. That's why I teamed up with Dean Kamen to produce my back-to-school TV special, "i.am FIRST: Science is Rock and Roll" that will air on Sunday August 14th on ABC 7pm|6pm central time.
This TV special is part of my paying it forward plans, and a way to thank the people who helped spark my curiosity to do well in school, including my Mom and my uncles. I want to share my excitement about technology and science with as many students as possible and to show that it can be creative and cool.
For every person who took my first phone call or answered my email and good things happened, this is another reason to do a good deed for someone else. All those school basketball courts could be shared to host local FIRST club activities.
The theory is simple -- if entertainers perform in programs like the Teen Choice Awards, then why can't we do it for our kids who get good grades? You would be amazed to see how many people thought kids and robotics weren't important. It's amazing how many non-believers there are in the world, and I realized why America is in a weird state -- a divided state. A state of dysfunction. A state of what the fuck. It's like people don't want to take real risks. So I took a risk. I stand to lose a lot of my own dollars to make this show. I didn't do it to make money. I did it to make change. I called ABC myself and bought air time. Sometimes you have to take risks and just do it, so I did it and I am proud of this show and everyone who helped me.
Debt ceilings, unemployment rates -- this stuff I don't understand and I probably never will understand it. Just like how I don't understand why we can't create new jobs in America. Why can't the youth get better education? Why is it that every school, public and private, in good neighborhoods and bad has a busy basketball court while the majority of its students are underperforming in math and science skills? It makes me really sad and angry to know that the U.S. ranks 25th out of 34 places in high school math skills.
I feel obligated as an American citizen to do this work. I'm the guy that made the "Yes We Can" video, so this is my part of the "we" in the "Yes We Can," concept. I'm doing my part and so are these kids and parents that are a part Dean Kamen's FIRST. These kids are amazing. They are dedicated to math, science, engineering, technology. These kids are our Michael Jordans and Kobe Bryants and our team is losing right now. If we don't acknowledge them and support them, they might not want to play for our American team when they graduate from college. They probably won't create jobs in America with the technology they invent.
If we support the troops, we have to support our scientists, engineers, programmers, code writers and geniuses. I believe solving our debt ceiling is job creation, but what do I know? I'm just a rapper.
For a stunning and emotional 18 minutes on Thursday, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly cut through a nasty debate over condolence calls to Gold Star families, appealing to the political class to allow at least this one thing to remain “sacred.”
Instead, Democratic lawmakers and operatives and allies in the media immediately turned on Kelly – himself a Gold Star father – branding him a liar and an “enabler” of President Trump, even suggesting his criticism of a black Democrat who publicized one of those calls was racist.
“Kelly isnt just an enabler of Trump. He's a believer in him. That makes him as odious as the rest. Dont be distracted by the uniform,” Hillary Clinton's former spokesman and CNN contributor Brian Fallon tweeted.
“I am stunned by John Kelley's lies about a black woman who he called an 'empty barrel,'” MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell tweeted.
During his appearance in the White House briefing room on Thursday, Kelly tried to reset – and resolve – the unseemly weeklong political war over presidential calls to families of dead American soldiers.
President Trump effectively started that debate after questioning earlier this week whether former President Barack Obama made those phone calls. But Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., escalated the fight when she criticized Trump's call to the widow of a soldier killed earlier this month in Niger.
Ironically, Kelly seemed to back up a portion of her account – that Trump told the widow that Sgt. La David Johnson “knew what he signed up for.” But Kelly defended Trump's call and sought to put his words in context – they were a version of what Gen. Joseph Dunford told the retired general when his own son was killed in Afghanistan – and condemned Wilson for both listening to that phone call and talking about it to the press.
Kelly said he was “stunned” and “brokenhearted” that Wilson would do that, adding: “I thought at least that was sacred.”
In response, Wilson said Kelly was just trying to save his job – and joked that she'd have to tell her kids she's a “rock star” given how much the White House is paying attention to her.
Even after Wilson's office said they would not be making any further comment “because the focus should be on helping a grieving widow and family heal, not on her or Donald Trump,” the congresswoman appeared on CNN's “New Day” to accuse Kelly of lying about her.
“It's a lie,” she said Friday, referring to his criticism of Wilson in 2015 allegedly boasting about getting the funding for an FBI building dedicated to fallen agents. (Wilson said she wasn't in Congress when that was secured, though she was in Congress for and attended the 2015 dedication. Video of that event released Friday by a Florida newspaper shows Wilson did not talk about the building's funding, but did talk up her own efforts getting legislation passed naming the building after the fallen agents.)
Further, Wilson claimed that one of Kelly's terms for her – an empty barrel – was “racist,” even though she also said she hadn't heard of an empty barrel before.
Kelly has used the term before for other lawmakers.
Meanwhile, Trump lashed out overnight at Wilson again.
“The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D), who was SECRETLY on a very personal call, and gave a total lie on content!” he tweeted.
And former Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke, highlighting a photo of Wilson in one of her trademark, shiny cowboy hats, tweeted: “.@realDonaldTrump calling Frederica Wilson ‘whacky' is putting it mildly. The woman is a buffoon. Look at her.”
Kelly, as he left the podium on Thursday, left the media and the public with these words:
“As I walk off the stage, understand there are tens of thousands of American kids, mostly, doing the nation's bidding all around the world. They don't have to be in uniform. … These young people today, they don't do it for any other reason than their selfless sense of selfless devotion to this great nation.”
In order to keep their season alive, the Cubs had to win Game Six. They won Game Six. Tomorrow, they play for all the marbles, with one more win bringing the franchise their first championship in 108 years. From that perspective, tonight was a success. Full stop.
But that perspective is a particularly binary view of the world, with only good and bad outcomes, and no room for the shades of gray that make up real life. In this world, things can be somewhat good, or very good, or painfully awful, or just kind of not great. In this world, we have not two possible outcomes, but thousands of them, with differing levels of magnitude. And from a perspective that accounts for the different magnitudes of outcomes, this Cubs win isn't quite as great as it could have been. This win came with a cost, and probably unnecessarily so.
Entering the bottom of the seventh inning, the Cubs led 7-2, giving them nine outs to keep the Tribe from scoring more than four runs. History tells us that teams in this situation go on to win 96.7% of the time. But that 3.3% is not a comfortable 3.3% when that 1-in-30 chance means your season ends. Joe Maddon wanted to drive that number down to 0%, so he had Aroldis Chapman getting loose in case Cleveland started to rally.
Mike Montgomery got Rajai Davis out to lead off the inning. Eight outs to go, win expectancy up to 97.6%. But then he walked Roberto Perez, putting it back to 96.5%, and Chapman started to throw. Carlos Santana flew out. Seven outs to go, win expectancy at 97.8%. Jason Kipnis singled: 96.9%. With Francisco Lindor and Mike Napoli due up next, Maddon didn't want to entrust his second-best lefty with the responsibility of getting out the team's two middle-of-the-order righties. So in came Chapman, with seven outs to go, protecting a five-run lead.
For Maddon, and all the other new-school managers this postseason, this has been the decision. Dave Roberts called on Kenley Jansen for a four-out save in Game Three of the NLCS despite his team leading 4-0, and left Jansen in to pitch the ninth even after the team pushed their lead to 6-0. Cody Allen pitched the ninth inning of Game One of the World Series even with his team up 6-0. Bullpens have been managed in a radically different way this postseason, but the strategy of doing whatever it takes to protect a lead, no matter how large, has survived the revolution.
The justification for these decisions is pretty simple: managers are erring on the side of risk-aversion, not wanting to see their inferior relievers allow a rally that forces their best relievers into a tough situation when they could just use the dominating guy first and avoid the potential stress altogether. If you put Pedro Strop or Carl Edwards or Justin Grimm on the mound in the seventh inning, and Lindor and Napoli keep the inning going, you're going to have to use Chapman anyway, and now the game be wildly different. Slam the door, win today, and figure out tomorrow tomorrow.
But that's the binary worldview again. That doesn't allow for their to be different levels of useful wins, or for what happens today to have a real impact on what happens tomorrow. In the world we're actually in, where shades exist, this was about as great of a loss as Cleveland could hope for, because the Cubs gave up their best kind of win in order to secure a slightly more certain lesser win.
For the Tribe, they lost, but they lost without throwing Andrew Miller or Cody Allen. They didn't even throw Bryan Shaw. By getting down big early, Terry Francona was able to lose with his JV pitchers. And now, in the real winner-takes-all game, he'll have his three best relief arms completely fresh and ready to go.
Joe Maddon could have had that, too. Had he resisted the urge to use Chapman to protect a five-run lead, he could have had the only reliever he really trusts right now completely rested for Game Seven. Instead, Chapman threw 20 pitches tonight, and warmed up three times — once to come in, and twice between innings — while recording five outs. Chapman will still definitely pitch tomorrow, but now, his outing will come with real uncertainty.
To be clear, we don't know what pitching tonight will do to Chapman's effectiveness or endurance tomorrow. No one does. It might not do anything. Perhaps the adrenaline provided from pitching in Game Seven of the World Series will overcome any kind of fatigue that might set in after throwing 62 pitches in the previous three days. Maybe Chapman, who has struggled with his command at times this postseason, will locate better at 99 than he would have at 102. Maybe the Cubs will crush Corey Kluber in the first inning and Chapman's ability to work multiple innings will have no impact on the outcome whatsoever.
To pretend that this is an area where we can definitely show the precise cost being paid would be folly. But uncertainty in and of itself is a cost, and it's one the Cubs will now pay, because they also don't know what pitching tonight will do to Chapman's performance tomorrow. They can hope the impact is zero. They can believe that Chapman will still be Chapman, throwing gas for as long as he's asked to throw gas. But the ability to plan on Chapman entering the game in the seventh inning, and pitching you all the way through the ninth? You can't do that anymore, because Chapman's usage tonight made his ability to do it again tomorrow uncertain.
If they hadn't used Chapman, the Cubs probably could have told him he was getting the last nine outs tomorrow, and prepared him to start the seventh inning, regardless of the score. That would have left only 18 outs for Kyle Hendricks and Jon Lester, the team's two best starting pitchers this year, to tag-team their way through. But I don't know how you plan to give Chapman nine outs now, and perhaps more importantly, I don't know how you create a plan for tomorrow that doesn't require a reasonable contingency if Chapman looks diminished when he enters. Now, you need a Plan B.
And so now, Maddon might have to choose which reliever he might trust to pick Chapman up if the workload proves to be an issue, and he'll either have to pick from among the pitchers he didn't trust with a five-run lead tonight, or perhaps one of the starters-available-out-of-the-pen that could have otherwise been used before Chapman took the mound. If Maddon had a two-days-rest Chapman tomorrow, there would be little harm in throwing both Jon Lester and John Lackey in relief of Kyle Hendricks, allowing him to remove Hendricks from the game early if need be.
Now, though, at least one of those two is probably hanging back in reserve. The Cubs pitching staff tomorrow could have been almost ideal, with the team capable of getting multiple innings from four really good pitchers, locking out all the pitchers that Maddon doesn't trust from a game where Cleveland will almost certainly rely only on Corey Kluber, Andrew Miller, Cody Allen, and maybe Bryan Shaw.
But now, the Cubs will likely have to extend Hendricks longer tomorrow, as the bridge to Chapman is less secure, and the team can't be as confident that Chapman will be the lockdown relief ace they acquired him to be. And the Cleveland blueprint is clear; if they have the lead after four innings, they're going to make the Cubs score the tying run against Andrew Miller. Any hole Hendricks might dig in the third or fourth inning could end up being the Cubs grave.
None of this is certain, of course. Because it's baseball, there's a good chance that none of this will matter, and the outcome of tomorrow's game will be determined by something completely unrelated to the Cubs reliever usage in Game Six.
But tonight, Joe Maddon chose to give into the fear of the 3%, believing that his secondary relievers weren't capable of holding a five-run lead, and not believing in his offense to help them win the game back even if they did. He managed not to lose Game Six instead of managing to win Game Seven at a point in which Game Seven was pretty close to already secure. The emotional desire to not even flirt with blowing a lead, ending the team's season in the process, overcame the rational reality that the game was mostly already over.
So Aroldis Chapman got five outs that the other Cubs relievers probably could have gotten. Those outs may well have been borrowed from Game Seven, in a situation where the Cubs might really be able to use a full-strength Chapman on the mound. But they won't have that, because when push came to shove, Joe Maddon only trusts one of his relievers right now.
For his sake, I hope he doesn't need that one reliever to bail him out tomorrow.
A DMM Games stage presentation at the Tokyo Game Show event on Thursday revealed that Acquire's Akiba's Trip game franchise is inspiring a television anime adaptation by studio Gonzo that will premiere in January 2017. The anime will be titled Akiba's Trip: The Animation , and it will air on Tokyo MX, BS Fuji, and AT-X.
The anime is serving as the first project to commemorate Gonzo's 25th anniversary.
The official website for the anime also reveals its main staff. Hiroshi Ikehata (Seiyu's Life!, Robot Girls Z) is directing the series, Kazuho Hyodo (ReLIFE, Robot Girls Z) is handling the series composition, and Hajime Mitsuda (key animator for Steins;Gate, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt) is designing the characters.
The Akiba's Trip games take place in a reproduction of Tokyo's Akihabara district, where the player must fight vampires by tearing off their clothes and exposing them to the sunlight.
Game developer Acquire released the original Akiba's Trip game for the PlayStation Portable in 2011, and an updated version, Akiba's Trip Plus, for PSP in 2012. Acquire released the Akiba's Trip 2 sequel game for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013.
XSEED Games released Akiba's Trip 2 in North America as Akiba's Trip: Undead and Undressed on PS3 and PS Vita, and later on PlayStation 4 and PC. NIS America released the game in Europe.
Additionally, the Akiba's Trip Festa! PC browser and Android game is also slated to arrive at the end of November.
The Akiba's Beat successor game is the first action RPG in the franchise, and it will ship for the PS4 and PS Vita in Japan this winter after a delay. XSEED Games will release the game this winter in English on the same systems.

Miami Heat star Tyler Johnson, one of last year's big winners of the NBA free agency period, is ready to cut another deal. He's put his home in Pinecrest, Fla., an affluent suburb south of Miami, on the market for $5.25 million.
Set behind walls and gates, the Mediterranean-style spread features vaulted ceilings, designer finishes, two chef's kitchens and a home theater with stadium seating. An elevator services both floors, as does a wrought iron staircase. In the entertainment lounge, there are pool tables and a full bar.
The roughly 12,000-square-foot home in Pinecrest, Fla., features a resort-style swimming pool and a basketball half-court outdoors. (Zignavisual) (Zignavisual)
The master suite has a steam shower and French doors that open to a balcony overlooking the backyard. A total of six bedrooms, eight full bathrooms and two half-baths lie within nearly 12,000 square feet of interior space.
Outdoors, the palm-topped setting centers on a tiled swimming pool and spa with waterfall and fire features. A pool cabana, covered and uncovered patio space and a lighted and fenced basketball half-court fill out the one-acre grounds.
Johnson, who last off-season signed a four-year, $50-million contract with the Heat, bought the property about 10 months ago for $4.82 million, records show.
Kim Knausz of One Sotheby's International Realty holds the listing.
Johnson, 25, joined the Heat in 2014 as an undrafted free agent. In 73 games last year, the Fresno State product averaged a career-high 13.7 points and four rebounds.

By their own admission, one of the main aims of Codemasters for the first three years of producing their F1 series was to secure the exclusive rights to make the official games into 2014 and beyond. Once that was achieved, they said, they would be able to make bigger, better and more exciting games.
So what does F1 2013 ?����ǣ the first new game since Codemasters received that all-important rights extension from Bernie Ecclestone ?����ǣ have to offer the sport's millions of fans around the world that previous games did not?
The answer is the most exciting new addition to the series to date. And by ‘new', I should really say ‘old'.
Classic mode
Yes, the fans' most requested feature ?����ǣ classic grand prix cars ?����ǣ is the major new addition to the official F1 game series for this year. And Codemasters envisage it being a much more extensive offering than what was found in previous official games which included older cars, such as Sony's 2007 release Formula One: Championship Edition.
Instead of throwing random cars from F1 history into the game Codemasters have focused on two decades that will likely strike the most nostalgic chords with their target audience ?����ǣ the eighties and nineties. The Classic mode is split between the two decades and allows players to jump behind the wheel of five classic cars from the eighties and nineties.
The first batch of cars includes the 1988 Lotus 100T (pictured top), Williams cars such as Alan Jones?������s FW07 and some yet-to-be-announced Ferraris. Screenshots also suggest the 1988 Williams-Judd FW12 will feature.
A further six classic Williams and Ferrari cars from the nineties are on offer including Nigel Mansell?������s 1992 championship winning FW14B, Damon Hill?������s FW18 from 1996 and the Ferrari F399 as driven by Eddie Irvine to the runner-up spot in 1999. Advertising restrictions mean they are depicted in non-tobacco liveries.
While some may have hoped for a greater number and wider variety of vehicles, that will likely be forgotten once players reintroduce these retired greats to the race track once again. And with classic cars come classic circuits as Codemasters will include fully modelled retro versions of Jerez, Brands Hatch, Imola and Estoril to drive in the game ?����ǣ all in their classic 1980s and 1990s glory without a single chicane, tarmac run-off or DRS zone in sight.
With fat tyres, less aerodynamic efficiency and – in some cases – screaming turbo engines, the classics are tremendous fun and require real roughneck driving to lower lap times. The FW07B and 100T can be thrown into the corners like over-sized, over-powered go-karts as you feel the car starting to slide at the limit of adhesion. While the FW14B has all the phenomenal mechanical grip and stability you?������d expect from a car famed for its advanced active suspension system. Hanging a Lotus 100T on the ragged edge through the high-speed turns of pre-chicane Jerez bathed in beautiful lighting with the whine of the turbo engine as it kicks through the gears is immensely satisfying.
The Classic mode is littered with small touches that will no doubt be appreciated by hardcore F1 fans. The heads-up display for the eighties cars has been redesigned to reflect the basic yellow graphics overlay from F1 broadcasts of the time (if you?������ve seen the film Senna you?������ll recognise them). The HUD for nineties cars has been designed as a homage to the blue and yellow overlay graphics that were used in FOM?������s digital coverage of the sport from the late 1990s to 2002.
Each car has a unique tachometer, working cockpit views with basic LED rev counters and both gear and brake-balance changing animations. While the 2013 cars sit in modern pit areas with laptops and monitors on the main home screen, enter Classic mode and the cars sit in old-style garages surrounded by toolboxes. Players will also be introduced to the mode in a series of videos narrated by the iconic voice of Murray Walker, which adds immensely to its nostalgic appeal.
But the best news about the Classic mode isn't?������t that players will get to drive the cars ?����ǣ but that they?������ll also get to race them. Properly. All cars can be raced in a variety of modes, both online and offline, including Grand Prix mode, Quick Race, in a custom championship as well as in online and split-screen multiplayer.
One disappointing limitation is that players are forbidden from mixing cars from different eras ?����ǣ so no pitting a Williams FW07 against an FW14B or this year?������s Ferrari against its 1999 ancestor. However players will be able to drive and race any car ?����ǣ 1980s, 1990s and 2013 ?����ǣ on any circuit, modern or classic.
The identities of several famous past racers also appear: Nigel Mansell, Mario Andretti and Gerhard Berger are the first of ten Formula One greats who players can race against in the 1980s cars while Alain Prost, David Coulthard, Jacques Villeneuve and Eddie Irvine have been announced as the first confirmed drivers in the 1990s cars. Expect more big names to be announced as the game nears its autumn release.
In a first for Codemasters' F1 titles, this year's game will be released in two editions. The standard version will include the 1980s cars plus Jerez and Brands Hatch circuits, with the 1990s cars, Imola and Estoril available to purchase via download after release. F1 2013 Classic Edition features all the classic cars and tracks.
The 2013 game
Those expecting revolutionary changes to the real meat of the game ?����ǣ the 2013 season ?����ǣ will likely be disappointed. The core experience to be had in F1 2013 seems little changed from previous editions, aside from all the expected team, driver and track updates.
Car setup parameters, options, cameras, menu system and game modes remain virtually identical to 2012, A new addition to the Proving Grounds mode is yet to be detailed. As far as the main career mode is concerned, no mention has been made yet of any significant changes and while it is claimed the Young Driver Test tutorial mode at the Yas Marina circuit has been expanded, it?������s not yet known how.
Handling feels similar but refined compared to last year. Even with no driving assists and the use of an Xbox 360 controller, it was relatively easy to push from the very first lap of the game around Silverstone in Time Trial mode in Nico Hulkenberg?������s Sauber without spinning. With a Fanatec wheel and pedals set-up the handling felt precise and fun, but no more challenging or removed from 2012. Unfortunately, it still seems at this early stage as though unrealistically extreme setups ?����ǣ ultra-low ride heights and super-stiff springs ?����ǣ offer the best reduction in lap times with minimal impact on balance.
While it?������s easy to assume this means Codemasters have put all their efforts into the classic mode for this year and neglected the 2013 experience, there are certainly some positive additions to the 2013 aspect of the game. In a welcome move, cockpit mirrors have an increased depth of vision ?����ǣ meaning they are now actually useful, whilst players now have the option to save mid-session, which will surely please 100% race distance enthusiasts. In an attempt to improve AI balancing in single player, F1 2013 now has five difficulty settings ?����ǣ Amateur, Intermediate, Professional, Expert and Legend ?����ǣ each with its own AI speed level to suit.
Tyre wear scaling to race distance makes a return to the series, as does the ability to race a full or custom championship season with any licensed driver in Grand Prix mode. Codemasters claim to have improved the penalty system – which had been criticised by some – and AI driver aggression, making your computer rivals more inclined to attack you. However the demonstration builds that were tested were locked to Time Trial mode, so we'll have to wait for the finished product to see how successful they have been.
The game?������s audio has been also been improved, with the addition of a satisfying gearbox backfire sound under downshifting and higher-pitched external engine sounds making the cars sound more pleasant when passing. In terms of the online experience, players should not expect anything too different from what they are used to already, although hosts do now have the ability to turn off the penalty system in races ?����ǣ which will surely be music to the ears of those who organise online championships.
With more to be announced as the game nears release, this is likely to prove the most hotly-anticipated Codemasters F1 game since they took over the franchise. We await the arrival of definitive game eager to discover whether the addition of old-style cars and tracks is what Codemasters needed to breathe new life into their exclusive F1 game series.

Collection History
The New York Public Library possesses one of the largest and finest collections of medieval and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts in North America, yet its manuscript holdings are scarcely known to scholars, much less to a wide public audience. Medieval and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts are vehicles of the collective memory of western European culture, and provide a material connection between the scribes, illuminators, and patrons who produced these works and the audiences who view them today.
The works represent diverse genres, from Bibles and missals to romance literature and science texts. Dating from the turn of the 10th century until well into the period of the Renaissance, these works give vivid testimony to the creative impulses of the often nameless craftsmen who continually discovered new ways of animating the contents of hand-produced books through inventive and sometimes exuberant manipulations of all the elements of the book: form and format, layout, script, decoration, illustration, and binding.
Drawn from the Library's Spencer Collection and the Manuscripts and Archives Division, these works focus on the 9th through the 16th centuries -- seven hundred years of profound political, ecclesiastical, social, and intellectual change in Western Europe and the world. Among these rare items are a 10th-century Ottonian manuscript, with its imitation of Byzantine textile with gold decoration; the Towneley Lectionary, illuminated by Giulio Clovio (once praised as the "Michelangelo of small works"), which originated in Rome and probably belonged to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese; and a late 15th-century Book of Hours, which represents the leading style of illumination from Besançon, one of the French Regional Schools.
Background
"The Digital Scriptorium" originated in the mid-1990s as an image database, intended to unite scattered resources from many institutions into an international tool for teaching and scholarly research. NYPL curators have augmented the Digital Scriptorium's primary documentation of NYPL's contribution of 259 manuscript parts with images of the works' most significant illuminations. Some works in this digital presentation also appeared in the exhibition, "The Splendor of the Word: Medieval and Renaissance Illuminated Manuscripts at The New York Public Library," held October 21, 2005 - February 12, 2006 in the Library's D. Samuel and Jeane H. Gottesman Exhibition Hall.

New evidence in a 9/11 lawsuit against the government of Saudi Arabia alleges the kingdom's embassy in Washington, DC, may have funded a test run for the deadly attacks in 2001, according to a US newspaper report.
The evidence was submitted as part of a class action lawsuit against the government of Saudi Arabia, the New York Post reported on Saturday.
It alleges that the embassy paid for two Saudi nationals to fly from Phoenix to Washington two years before planes hit the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and slammed into a field in Pennsylvania as part of a "dry run" for the attacks.
Saudi Arabia has always denied any involvement in the September 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
The victims' lawyers, however, have said the evidence suggests "a pattern of both financial and operational support" for the 9/11 conspiracy from official Saudi sources, according to the Post.

The evidence could further reinforce the claim that employees and agents of Saudi Arabia directed and supported the hijackers.
Waleed Nassar, an international disputes lawyer who represents two Saudi charities that are defendants in 9/11 litigation alongside Saudi Arabia, said, "the evidence, along with much of what has been submitted, is innuendo and circumstantial".
"The plaintiff's burden is to show something more direct, and that's really the only hope they have to have Saudi Arabia remain in the litigation," Nassar said.
The story cites FBI documents in the complaint alleging Saudi students Mohammed al-Qudhaeein and Hamdan al-Shalawi were in fact members of "the Kingdom's network of agents in the US", and participated in the conspiracy.

During the flight in November 1999, the Saudis are reported to have attempted to get into the plane's cockpit to test security. The pilots made an emergency landing because of the incident, and the men were interrogated by the FBI, which eventually let them go.
According to the Post story, the FBI confirmed the men's airline tickets were paid for by the Saudi embassy in Washington.
Bill Law, a journalist who specialises in Gulf affairs, told Al Jazeera that at this stage the claims are "only an allegation".
He added, based on the case, that he believes "there are certain pointers that would suggest that there was not, perhaps direct Saudi government involvement, but there were people who were close to, perhaps the ruling family, people who were in different government departments who may have facilitated some of the early 'dry runs' ... of what then became the horrific 9/11 attack".
9/11 law
The story follows the passage of a US law last year that allows families of the victims of the September 11 attacks to sue the Saudi government.
The law, which was originally vetoed by former President Barack Obama, allows survivors and relatives of victims to pursue cases against foreign governments in US federal court and to demand compensation if such governments are proved to bear some responsibility for attacks on American soil.

Fifteen of the 19 men who carried out the 2001 attacks were Saudi nationals. Families of the victims spent years lobbying politicians for the right to sue the kingdom in US courts for any role elements of Saudi Arabia's government may have played.
Saudi Arabia has long denied any involvement in the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people and marked the beginning of the US' "war on terror".
Sean Kilpatrick returning to the lineup and to make it even sweeter the 76ers were down to a rotation of eight players and Tiago Splitter , who was making his first appearance in over a calendar year. It was a recipe for another Nets win but instead it turned into a debacle.
Jeremy Lin had one of his worst games from the floor of the season, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson shot his way out of the game, Brooklyn imploded late in the game, and Dario Saric added another game to his blooming Rookie of the Year resume.
Jeremy Lin Played A Bad Game, And He Knew It
Its looking more and more the way Jeremy Lin goes, so goes the Brooklyn Nets. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Lin had a really bad game last night from the floor. He played 29 minutes and ended with 11 points, seven assists, six rebounds, four steals, two turnovers, and three fouls on four of fourteen from the floor while going zero of four from deep. He filled up the stat sheet in other ways but was visibly frustrated with both his inability to hit open shots and a lack of calls going his way.
Most frustrated I've seen Lin all season. Not his best night pic.twitter.com/sOMjwqzs1q — Anthony Puccio (@APOOCH) March 29, 2017
Lin was matched up on T.J. McConnell for a majority of the night and was presented with a plethora of good looks but for whatever reason the ball just wasn't going in for him tonight. Unlike most nights when faced with adversity, Lin failed to meet it with his patented cool demeanor. Following the game, Lin was the first person to admit that this game was not up to his usual standards.
Jeremy Lin post-game: Its on me. pic.twitter.com/Uu194vhiMB — Anthony Puccio (@APOOCH) March 29, 2017
This game only solidified that Brooklyn needs to start looking at a point guard as well in free agency. Not as a replacement for Lin, but it is clear he can't and shouldn't be the only true point guard on this team. Both Spencer Dinwiddie and Isaiah Whitehead show promise, but are far from ready to be a true backup point guard and aren't anywhere near Lin's skill level.
Every good team has two or three guys that can facilitate the offense and help others get shots. Right now Brooklyn only has Lin. Adding another highly skilled guard will only help the entire team. The fans that follow Lin should not only brace for an eventual signing but welcome it with open arms because it will only help Lin look more like the player he was in Charlotte.
Hollis-Jefferson Shouldn't Have The Green Light Anymore
Rondae Hollis-Jefferson has proven time and time again that his jump shot is truly broken, last night is just another example of it. He ended with 11 points and seven rebounds but shot an abysmal five of fifteen from the floor. Matching up against rookie Dario Saric proved to be too big a task for the born again power forward.
Kenny Atkinson has given Hollis-Jefferson an insane amount of leeway this season to develop into whatever will make him the most successful player going forward. At the beginning of the year, it was him on the wing as a 3&D prospect that also brings the ball up the floor, but failed to hit any shots from the permitter. Now he is playing power forward and getting beat up by stronger, bigger players routinely.
Its not that I don't have faith in Hollis-Jefferson, I just wish the team could recognize when a game is close and be able to quit experimenting in order to buckle down and get the victory. Its clear that all of these games are pointless as far as the final record and draft choice goes, but they mean something to the players and the fans. When it gets down to crunch time minutes, Hollis-Jefferson shouldn't be attempting anything outside of layups and dunks.
The Third Quarter Doesn't Seem To Be The Issue Anymore
Since the All-Star break, the third quarter is far from the issue for the Brooklyn Nets. They are no longer getting blown out after halftime, but instead standing tough and usually coming out winning the quarter. The team is building on momentum from a good second quarter and usually establishes a big enough lead that when they eventually collapse slightly in the fourth, they can weather the storm. Unfortunately that didn't happen this time.
Brooklyn outscored Philadelphia 33-27 in the second quarter and ended the third quarter tying the 76ers in points scored with 21. Brooklyn maintained a lead until the 2:29 mark of the fourth quarter but couldn't hold off Saric and the surging 76ers.
The Nets have a real problem finishing games. This happens in the beginning of the fourth quarter whenever the starters are pulled for rest. The bench unit failed to hold the 76ers off starting late in the third and despite making it a close game, couldn't hold on for the win.
Dario Saric Will Win Rookie Of The Year
Last night was the definitive Dario Saric Rookie of the Year candidate game. He ended with 23 points and seven rebounds on eight of fifteen shooting from the floor while being the obvious leader on the floor for the 76ers. With teammate Joel Embiid sidelined before playing the minimum required games to qualify for he awards, Saric has slide into the favorite to win it.
Saric shows just exactly what a stretch four that rebounds and defends can do for a team. He shut down Hollis-Jefferson all night and looked like a seasoned veteran for the entire game. Hopefully he doesn't get bitten by the injury bug because he stands a chance at being a real difference maker for the 76ers down the road.
(Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications recorded their steepest weekly decline in six months last week, even as most borrowing costs on home loans held steady, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday.
The Washington-based group said its seasonally adjusted measure on loan requests for home purchases and refinancing fell to 417.4 in the week ended June 23, a drop of 6.2 percent from the previous week.
This was the biggest weekly fall for the index since a 12.1 percent decline in the week of Dec. 23, 2016.
Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages remained at their lowest since November for a third straight week at 4.13 percent.
Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less that qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK).
Average rates on other types of mortgages that MBA tracks were mixed from the previous week.
MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications for home purchases, a proxy for future home sales, decreased to 241.7 last week, marking a 4.1 percent fall, its biggest since the Feb. 10 week.
The group's seasonally adjusted barometer of refinancing applications declined to 1,396.2, down 8.6 percent, the steepest since a 23.2 percent drop six months ago.

Put a few hundred hours into a game and you'll normally have its mechanics down pat. You may not be the greatest player ever, but you can usually expect to be at least competent and able to make a valuable contribution to your team's efforts. Sure, some teenager all hopped up on Mountain Dew and pubertal rage is still going to have faster reactions than you, but you'll get by.
Until you pick up Dota 2. In Dota 2 you can play for a hundred hours and still be the most useless n00b to ever play the game, a let down to your team, an embarrassment to friends and family. It's a brutal game. But if you get into it—and not everyone will—it can make a full-on heroin addiction look like nothing more severe than a mild hankering.
Staggered release Although Dota 2 officially launched out of beta this week, Valve has stopped short of making it a free-for-all where new players will get slaughtered by beta veterans. The game is being rolled out through a staggered launch, both to ensure that the game isn't inundated with people who don't know what they're doing and also to ensure that the matchmaking and game servers can tolerate the influx of new players.

Before its "official" (though still limited, see sidebar) release this week, Dota 2 has been available for the last two years as an invitation-only beta, with beta keys randomly assigned to existing players. In this way, it grew organically as gamers gave keys to friends or sold them for inflated prices. Even with this limited availability and a learning curve that's almost horizontal (in that additional time doesn't actually gain you much additional skill), Dota 2 has become hugely popular. It's the biggest game on Steam, boasting more concurrent players than any other title on Valve's DRM and distribution platform, regularly breaking 300,000 concurrent players.
What the heck is a MOBA?
Dota 2 is a game in a genre that has no good name. I'm going to go with "MOBA," standing for "Multiplayer Online Battle Arena," but "ARTS," for "action real time strategy" is not uncommon either. If you're not familiar with MOBAs, you're probably not alone.
Superficially, the basic MOBA setup is that of an RTS game: a top-down view of a play area, a minimap, two bases, and units that do battle, with the aim of defending their own base and destroying that of the enemy.
Know your Dota lineage Dota 2 itself is a sort of official sequel to Defense of the Ancients, a modification to Warcraft 3. The original DotA was itself inspired by a StarCraft mod, called Aeon of Strife. DotA's mysterious and anonymous developer, known only as IceFrog, was employed by Valve to work on what is, in essence, a brand-new version of the same game. Dota 2 itself is a sort of official sequel to Defense of the Ancients, a modification to Warcraft 3. The original DotA was itself inspired by a StarCraft mod, called Aeon of Strife. DotA's mysterious and anonymous developer, known only as IceFrog, was employed by Valve to work on what is, in essence, a brand-new version of the same game. This time around, however, the game is a standalone, free-to-play title built using Valve's Source engine rather than as a mod to another game. The old mod is still being developed, but the two games are essentially being developed in parallel. Dota 2 looks an awful lot better, but DotA has a few extra heroes that are still awaiting their migration.
However, MOBAs turn RTS gameplay on its head. In a traditional RTS, you build a base, collect resources, build your army, and then attack. In a MOBA, there's no base building and no army. Instead of building, the bases are predefined—there's a large structure (the "ancient," in Dota 2 terminology) at the heart of your base, and a series of defensive towers along three different paths ("lanes") that join your base with the enemy's.
Instead of an army, you have heroes and creeps. Creeps are automated, computer-controlled units. They spawn every 30 seconds and march along the lanes from your base to the enemy. They fight any enemies they happen to meet along the way.
Heroes are where the player gets involved. Each side in Dota 2 has five heroes, picked from a pool of somewhere north of 100. Heroes have three attributes: strength, which governs the number of hitpoints and how fast they regenerate; intelligence, which governs the amount of mana you have and how fast it regenerates; and agility, which governs how fast you fire and how much armor you have.
Heroes can have short or long-range attacks and also have active or passive abilities that differentiate them from other players. Players can also buy items with in-game gold to get anything from regenerating health to unlocking faster movement to briefly turning enemy units into pigs.
Each individual game starts from scratch; abilities and items have to be earned through strong play in that very match. There are no persistent (non-cosmetic) unlocks or anything of that ilk; everyone in a game has the same selection of heroes available, the same set of abilities, and the same set of items. The only advantage that experienced players take into a game is their knowledge and expertise; their heroes work just the same as everyone else's.
It's also important to note that death isn't permanent in Dota 2. When your character dies, you lose some gold, your positioning, and up to 100 seconds of time while you wait for a respawn. This is precious time where your opponents continue to gain experience and gold for better abilities and items, though, so early deaths can really snowball into a worse position overall.
Heroes are broadly split into a number of nuanced classifications, but the major split is between "carry" heroes and "support" heroes. Carry heroes are pretty vulnerable early on, but they can carry their team late in the game if they get a chance to reach their higher levels and items. During the end game, these characters can lay down huge amounts of damage in a short space of time and often soak up a huge amount of damage too.
Support heroes are more powerful early on, but their usefulness tends to taper off as the game continues. They have abilities that can stun or slow enemies, making it easier for others to pile on the damage, and they can often heal allies or use magic-based attacks to score early kills.
In a typical 30- to 60-minute game, the first 10 to 15 minutes is spent predominantly in the lanes, accumulating XP and trying to get the last hits and bonus gold on enemy creeps. After that, there's a phase where support characters roam around trying to pick off enemy heroes while the carries build up their gold and buy their essential items. The final phase of a match is characterized by epic five-on-five team fights where the carries really get to show their worth, killing the other team and destroying their base.
The long road to mastery
Sounds relatively simple, right? So what makes it so hard to learn? The most significant challenge is probably in the diversity of the heroes. There are more than a hundred to choose from, and they all have differences past the obvious cosmetic ones (though the backstories and well-voice-acted personalities of each one are entertaining in their own right). While some abilities are found on several heroes—for example, there's more than one hero with a "silence" spell that prevents an enemy from casting abilities of their own—they are, for the most part, remarkably diverse and differentiated.
It takes a couple of games just to get the basic hang of a hero and his abilities, but mastering a hero—knowing both how and when to use his abilities and when and what items to get—can take dozens of games, especially for one of the more micro-management-intensive heroes. Different attack animations for each hero mean you'll have to practice the crucial timing to get that last, gold-producing hit on an enemy as well.
Beyond the hero differences, there's also a great deal of teamwork to learn. Certain heroes are particularly strong at initiating a fight. For example, Magnus the Magnetaur (imagine a centaur with the physique and head of a rhinoceros) can pull all the enemies in a radius around him together using his magnetic rhino horn, temporarily disabling them. This allows other heroes with area-of-effect abilities to attack effectively and to set up some big kills.
But pulling off this combo requires skill and timing. The Magnus player has to recognize the right opportunity and pull off a series of moves in quick succession. The rest of the team then has to spring into action to take advantage of Magnus' initiation at the right time.
Then there are more nuanced and less obvious quirks, like figuring out where to stand, knowing when you're vulnerable to being killed, knowing when it's safe to go in on the attack and when it isn't, and so on. The result is a game that's easy enough to learn, at least in a basic sense, but which takes a phenomenally long time to master.
Throughout the beta, this complexity has been Dota 2's biggest issue. It's a hard game to get in to, especially without a friend to show you the ropes. A bad player can ruin the game for the others on his team, and this leads to a certain amount of hostility. The match-making system is supposed to pit you against players of a comparable skill level, but there's only so much it can do.
In the last few weeks of the beta, Valve fleshed out a tutorial mode that leads players through the basics, first in some special tutorial maps, then through matches against bots through to matches against other humans. Just playing through the tutorial's five matches against bots and 10 against humans, you'll probably put in 8-10 hours alone. At that point, you'll have a good grounding in the game but still be left with plenty to learn.
But is it any good?
So is the game itself worth the aggravation and difficulty of learning its nuances? When I first started playing back in February, I wasn't convinced. I jumped in without knowing what was going on (there was no tutorial back then), but I was fortunate enough to immediately find some friendly players who could explain the basics of the game. I also picked Windrunner as my first hero; by chance, it turns out she's a good choice for new players.
For the first month or two, I wasn't really sure if I liked the game. That sounds a bit weird, and it is. On some level, I presumably must have enjoyed the game to even stick with it for months, but I was never completely enthused by it. I just found myself wanting to play one... more... game....
If that first experience had been worse—if I'd been matched against players who were less welcoming and more abusive—I might easily have turned my back on it and never played it beyond that first handful of matches. There is a system for reporting abusive players, and I get semi-regular notifications that people I've reported have been punished, which is good, but the environment can still be quite hostile.
Instead, however, I stuck with it and started to actively enjoy it. Finding a friendly crowd to play with was key to really getting excited by the gameplay. The mechanics of every game will be the same, but the range of heroes, items, and strategies makes for a tremendously varied, entertaining experience.
Not only do I enjoy playing Dota 2, I also enjoy watching it. It has a fledgling professional e-sport scene, with the third major Valve-sponsored tournament, The International 3, taking place this August. There are countless tutorials and videos online, with Purge's "Welcome to Dota: You suck" ranking as probably the best-known and widely used.
Is it actually a good game? I am still not entirely sure. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it's endless frustration. Sometimes I have a game where it all comes together as it should, and it's fantastic. There are still plenty of things that surprise me, and still plenty of heroes that I'm completely useless with, even after hundreds of hours.
The competition
As the sort-of sequel to the original MOBA (see the lineage sidebar above) Dota 2 feels like the natural choice for players who want to get into the genre. However, it's certainly not the only one; Riot Games' free-to-play League of Legends, first released in 2009, has more players and a more developed e-sports scene than Dota 2 can currently boast. Which game is better is a matter for Internet flame wars. I haven't personally played League of Legends as I'm somewhat turned off by its more cartoonish graphical style and reports of a community that's even more hostile to newcomers than Dota 2's (though Riot is making efforts to fix this).
The basic concepts are broadly the same, but the details differ. League of Legends, for example, lacks some DotA staples such as denying (killing injured, allied creeps to prevent enemies from getting their gold). It also doesn't provide immediate zero-cost access to all the heroes. Instead, you can play a rotating set of heroes for free or purchase permanent access to favored choices. On the other hand, it adds an extra dimension with persistent rewards, such that each game isn't started from a clean slate.
If you're willing to put in the time investment, either of these games (or other MOBAs like Heroes of Newerth) is worth picking up, especially for the price of "free." It's generally agreed that whichever MOBA you play first is the one you're going to prefer. Dota 2 is the first one I played, so it's clearly the best.
Verdict: Well, you can't actually buy it, because it's free to play. But you should definitely play it.
The Good
Deep, engaging gameplay.
Diverse cast of highly differentiated heroes.
Tidehunter and Kunkka trolling each other.
The Bad
Other players can be jerks.
There's a slim chance that League of Legends is better.
The Ugly
I have somehow spent more than 800 hours in this game since February, which is utterly insane.

The heat is quickly fading from Miami's luxury housing market.
According to a new report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel, the average sale price for luxury condos in Miami and Miami Beach plunged 30 percent year over year in the third quarter, to $948,700 and $2.6 million respectively.
The number of luxury condo sales also plunged, by 25 percent in Miami and 17 percent in Miami Beach.
The declines mark another step down for high-end real estate in the area, which had experienced a boom after the financial crisis. It comes as buyers from Latin America are slowing to a trickle and uncertainty around the presidential election is causing wealthy Americans to pull back.
At the same time, luxury buildings that were started during the boom years of 2013 and 2014 are now starting to come online, creating a glut of high-priced homes and condos.
Miami's results echo those from other cities in the U.S., where the highest priced real estate is faring the worst.
Luxury "is becoming a smaller part of the market due to the reduced emphasis at the top," said Miller Samuel's Jonathan Miller.
Inventory of luxury condos in Miami Beach jumped 30 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago, to 1,235. These properties are now sitting on the market for an average 126 days, more than double last year's number.
In broader Miami, inventory rose 11 percent, resulting in a 40-month supply of luxury condos. Inventories for single-family homes in both areas are also higher.
Given these broad-based increases, Miller said the luxury real estate market in Miami is likely to get worse before it gets better.
"In terms of the luxury market, more product is coming online as developers try to reconfigure them to meet the demand of a changed market when they hit the market," Miller said. "The excess supply of luxury product will likely rise over the next year. "

NC These shocking pictures show the last moments of murdered Alexandra Mezher
Alexandra Mezher, 22, left a trail of blood as she desperately tried to pull herself to safety and begged for her life. The graduate bled to death from a severed artery in her thigh after she was stabbed repeatedly in the vicious attack. Asylum seeker Youssaf Khaliif Nuur, who claimed to be a minor in order to stay in the children's centre, has been charged with Miss Mezher's murder.
The Ethiopian, who is at least 21 years old, claims he can't remember the incident which took place on January 25. The gruesome pictures reveal how Miss Mezher desperately fought for her life after being stabbed as she tried to break up a fight before two young migrants she was caring for. Her trail of blood shows for the first time how the social worker tried to flee from the brutal attack, managing to crawl from the kitchen where she was stabbed, along the corridor and into a nearby bedroom. It was here, lying in a pool of blood among white stained sheets, that Miss Mezher lost her life.

Witnesses told police Miss Mezher desperately pled for her life, screaming “No, no, no Youssef” at least 10 times as he stabbed her. Miss Mezher's brutal murder in the centre for unaccompanied child migrants in Mölndal sent shockwaves across Sweden and Europe. Prosecutor Linda Wiking said: “The young man has shown extreme ruthlessness and harshness which caused the death of Alexandra Mezher.” The suspect claimed he was just 15 years old to gain a spot at the home for unaccompanied migrants. But prosecutors now say Nuur is at least 21 - if not older - meaning he should not have been at the centre for 14 to 17-year-olds. One of the other residents tried to protect Miss Mezher but was attacked himself before more boys arrive to help. But it was already too late for the young woman who bled to death before the emergency services arrived.

For some, building up the determination to part with your hard earned money for charity can be hard. But so can get your hands on Radiohead tickets. Who would've thought it'd be Edward Norton, of all people, who'd find a way to make both so much easier? And way more interesting.
Norton has launched a new charitable fundraising campaign through his own Crowdrise website to benefit Conservation International and Kenya's Maasai Wilderness Conservations Trust. While the money goes to the worthy cause of providing “financial support, technical expertise and strategic experience to MWCT's groundbreaking efforts to help traditional communities build sustainable economic opportunities through the conservation of critical ecosystems,” the incentive to donate goes beyond protecting the environment.
Each $10 donation earns an entry into a contest that will send the winner to New York City with roundtrip airfare, a two-night hotel stay, and — here's the kicker — a pair of VIP tickets to join Norton and his friends at Radiohead's Madison Square Garden show on July 26th. What's more, Norton will actually take you backstage to meet the band and you'll get a signed limited edition vinyl box set of A Moon Shaped Pool. (Oh, hey; apparently there's a limited edition vinyl box set coming of A Moon Shaped Pool.)
Sure, the concept of hanging backstage at a Radiohead show with the star of Fight Club and Death to Smoochy seems surreal as all hell, but keep in mind that it's all for a good cause. And Radiohead. The contest ends tomorrow (July 21st) at 5:00 PM EST, so enter at the Crowdrise website.

Detroit — Democrats have a unique chance to build on “the resistance” to President Donald Trump, candidates vying to lead the national party said Saturday in Detroit, outlining their comeback plans in the wake of a crushing 2016 election cycle.
Democratic activists and officials gathered at Wayne State University to hear from 10 candidates fighting to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, including Detroit native and U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota.
Four months after Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since 1988, Democrats pointed to massive marches for women's rights and protests over Trump's controversial immigration order as evidence of a surge in grassroots energy.
“We've got to recognize that not all of that needs to funnel through the Democratic Party,” said South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, arguing there is an organic quality to the protests that officials should support but not attempt to own.
“The Democratic party needs to figure out where we fit in the tapestry of the grassroots, not the other way around.”
Ellison called for a renewed focus on good old-fashioned ground work, proposing a nationwide summer canvas and asking activists to help the DNC “knock every door in this country if we can.”
He also stressed the importance of leading on labor and trade issues in the wake of an election that saw Trump make inroads with working-class voters.
“We start with the idea that the Democratic Party is the party that works for working people all the time and never lets up,” said Ellison, a Wayne State graduate whose mother was in the audience.
Ellison is considered a front-runner for the DNC chair post, along with former U.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez of Maryland, who proposed a similar boots-on-the-ground approach for the party.

This is the third of four regional DNC Future Forums. (Photo: Todd McInturf / The Detroit News)
“We start by organizing, organizing, organizing,” he said, “recognizing that data analysis is important, but there's no substitute for house calls. If we had made more house calls in person in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, we would have won these elections. We ignored the basics.”
The Detroit forum, the third of four similar outreach events planned before DNC members elect their next chair later this month in Atlanta, comes on the heels of a painful election cycle for Democrats, who lost the White House and remain outnumbered in Congress and a majority of state legislatures.
The event also featured several hopefuls for other party posts. It was the first DNC forums since Trump took office on Jan. 20.
“Fifteen days into it, and we have seen a frontal assault on our democracy,” said Perez. “He should be vetting his own (cabinet) nominees half as much as refugees are vetted. We see this existential threat folks, it is here, and we need a leader who's going to take the fight to Donald Trump.”
Democrats are not going to build momentum from “the resistence” with only platitudes and promises, said chair candidate Jehmu Greene, a former Democratic analyst for Fox News.
“We have become insular and out of touch,” she said.
Regrouping from losses
Michigan was a particularly rough state for Democrats in 2016. In addition to Trump's win, Michigan Republicans maintained their majorities in Congress, the state House and won several education seats they had long coveted.
Former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned from the post in late July after WikiLeaks published a series of emails suggesting DNC staffers had inappropriately aided eventual presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in her primary battle against U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Wikileaks emails also showed Interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile, who was working as a CNN contributor at the time, gave Clinton a heads-up on a potential question from a Flint resident ahead of a primary debate against Sanders in the beleaguered city.
“We have to tell everybody the fiasco of last spring will not be repeated,” said outsider chair candidate Peter Peckarsky of Wisconsin, who pledged to remain impartial in any party primaries.
“We lost of a lot of trust in this past election,” said Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. “This party has to go to where the people are instead of hoping that people will come to where we are.”
Brazile is not seeking the permanent chair position but used the forum to push for robust voter access, channeling voting rights icon Fannie Lou Hamer.
“There's no place in our Democracy for long lines, no place for broken machines no place in denying people the right to vote simply because they don't have the right kind of identification,” Brazile said.
While candidates stressed unity in Detroit, the DNC booted an 11th candidate from the program earlier this week. Vincent Tolliver, a former congressional candidate from Arkansas, had reportedly criticized the Muslim faith of Ellison, who was the first Muslim elected to Congress.
Ellison has worked to solidify support in the “progressive” wing of the party. Already backed by Sanders, he picked up another series of endorsements ahead of the Detroit forum, including support from 27 Michigan legislators and Teamsters President Jim Hoffa.
Perez, meanwhile, boasts a recent endorsement from former Vice President Joe Biden.
Ellison has a populist message that can unify Democrats and appeal to Trump voters the party has to win back in future elections, according to Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon.
“He has been by far, at least in Michigan, the most aggressive in talking about and reaching out to folks about why this state is a critical one not just for the next president election, but very important for winning back power in the state capitol,” Dillon told The Detroit News ahead of the forum.
Dillon is one of two voting DNC members from Michigan who have publicly endorsed Ellison, who is also backing Dillon's re-election bid at next weekend's state party convention at the Cobo Center. Dillon was among the guests at a reception Ellison held Friday night at the Westin Book Cadillac hotel.
Duggan renews refugee support
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan helped open up the DNC forum Friday morning, reaffirming his push to make the city a welcoming place for refugees, noting 50 families from war-torn Syria have resettled on the city's west side.
Duggan reiterated his “unapologetic support” for former President Barack Obama's refugee program one week after Trump instituted a temporary travel ban for refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries.
“When these families moved in, these people were not greeted with anger and protest. They were greeted with smiles and hugs,” the mayor told a crowd gathered for the day-long program.
On Friday, a federal judge issued an order blocking President Donald Trump's ban on admitting travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries or any refugees. In response, the White House vowed it would try to get a court to reinstate the ban. The predicament has prompted confusion Saturday among authorities and advocates over how to handle those who finally obtained visas to come to America.
Duggan in January of last year said Detroit was prepared to host refugees from Syria and other countries. The mayor said he was committed to welcoming 50 refugee families per year from Syria and elsewhere for three years.
Duggan told DNC attendees of Detroit's strides in recent years improving city parks and emergency response times, adding new city buses and expanding routes, and installing 65,000 LED streetlights. He also touted an unemployment rate that he said has been “cut in half” from about 20 percent four years ago to around 10 percent.
But Detroit's not “under any illusion about how far we have to go as a city,” he said.
He stressed the importance of providing workforce development and improving the standard of living for residents.
“At the end of the day, our success as a Democratic Party is whether we're a party that makes sure those opportunities are there,” he said, adding he hopes “we produce the next leadership for the DNC.”

Short Bytes: A team of researchers at Kaspersky Labs have recently cracked the mystery of a fileless malware that was used to hack bank ATMs in Russia and steal $800,000 in a single night. It was possible because of the two log files unintentionally left on the machine by the attackers. The researchers were able to reverse engineer the attack.
Some Russian banks are having sleepless nights because of a series of robberies that happened in the strangest way possible. As seen on the CCTV footage, a guy walks up to an ATM, stands for 20 minutes and goes back with a handful of cash in Rubles (roughly $100,000). All of this was done without even touching the machine. A similar story was repeated at other ATMs across the city, totaling the amount to $800,000 in just one night.
The banks were completely unaware of how did the guys perform the attacks. They didn't find any existence of malware on their backend network or the ATMs. The Russian security firm Kaspersky Labs was approached by one of the two affected banks.
The only digital traces of the attack were the two log files which the attackers might've left by mistake. The events that occurred on the machines were recorded in the log files. The logs also include a line of text written in English, “Take the money bitch.”
The story of the invisible malware
Earlier this year, Kaspersky Labs reported about invisible fileless malware attacks that affected around 140 banks in Europe, US, and other places. Such kind of malware resides in the random access memory of the devices, thus, reducing the chances of leaving any sign afterward.
Sergey Golovanov, a malware expert at Kaspersky Lab, who worked on the case says that the two log files might've been left while uninstalling the malware.
Golovanov and his team examined the two log files and concluded that the attack happened in three stages. First, the machine was commanded to withdraw cash from the cassettes and the second to put it on the dispensing tray. The third stage included the mouth of the ATM. The English text might've been logged at the same time and also as an indication on the screen for the guy.
However, that wasn't enough; the researchers took the help of a tool called YARA to create malware samples using the English text in the log files. They successfully found the match of the malware on VirusTotal – an online malware analysis tool – with two files uploaded by someone from Russia and Kazakhstan.
The researchers analyzed the bank's network. They were able to reverse engineer the code and reconstruct the attack process. The attackers had built a digital tunnel across the bank's network which allowed them to execute Windows Powershell commands and control the ATMs in real-time.
Golovanov says that fileless attacks might be difficult to track but not impossible. They've linked the possible ties of the attackers with two already known bank hacker gangs. Until now, no arrests have been made.

K-1 was offering me $187,500 per fight - five times what the UFC was offering - and I was still willing to stay with them for one-third of that amount. This was when the relationship took a turn for the worse, and my view of White changed drastically. From that point on, I knew when it came to money, we couldn't trust him to treat us right. Did I like him at the dinner table? Sure. But at the negotiating table? Not at all. The pressure to perform and safeguard other people's money had changed him, even though he was constantly bragging to anyone willing to listen about how 'big this thing was going to be.' Things between us would never be the same. When it was finally official I was going to fight in Japan, White called me up and told me his true feelings. 'You motherfucker! You're fucking done! You'll never fight in the UFC again! You're finished. You're scorched earth, motherfucker. Scorched earth. Don't call me crying saying you want to come back because you're fucking done!' And on and on and on, like a true professional - even going so far as to tell me I would never see my face again in a UFC video, promotion, or anything else. He also planned on removing my fight with Hughes from the UFC 46 DVD so no one would even know who I was. 'It doesn't have to be this way,' I told him. 'You know it wouldn't take that much to make this work.' But he just kept yelling.
--BJ Penn, discussing Dana White's reaction to his decision to leave the UFC after defeating Matt Hughes at UFC 46. This is from BJ Penn's new book.
While I haven't read the whole book, it's very likely that White's anger over Penn's book stemmed from this section. The biggest surprise to me is that Penn would come forward with a story like this while he is still an active UFC star. It's one thing to release a tell-all book after retirement, but one has to wonder what the motivation was to tell a story like this now.
As far as the veracity of the above story, I am strongly inclined to believe it is true. I've heard from enough agents and fighters about breakdowns in communication with the UFC to know what happens when they think someone is trying to screw them over.
A future Palestinian state will only be protected by its police force and not by a Palestinian army, President Mahmoud Abbas said late Sunday.

NATO troops, led by the Americans, should be responsible for the security of a future Palestinian state, he said in a New York Times interview. He also claimed that their deployment could be for an indefinite amount of time.

“For a long time, and wherever they want, not only on the eastern borders, but also on the western borders, everywhere,” Abbas said. “The third party can stay. They can stay to reassure the Israelis, and to protect us.
Regarding recognizing Israel as the Jewish State, Abbas said there wasn't a chance that would happen.
“This is out of the question,” he said referring to the Israeli peace deals with Jordan and Egypt, who were never asked to do.
Abbas refused also, however, to let any failure turn into an armed uprising. “In my life, and if I have any more life in the future, I will never return to the armed struggle.”
In regards to a Palestinian army, Abbas made it clear that he knew his neighbors well.
“We will be demilitarized,” he added. “Do you think we have any illusion that we can have any security if the Israelis do not feel they have security?”
Abbas said that the idea to deploy NATO troops was also supported by former prime ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, as well as US president George W. Bush.
He said he had previously presented the idea to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of an American-led NATO force, which would include Jordanians.

Whom do you trust?
“I told him: ‘If you will not trust your allies, so whom do you trust? I am not bringing for you Turkey and Indonesia,' ” Mr. Abbas recalled. “He said, ‘I trust my army only.'
He also said that the IDF could stay in the West Bank for a period of five years after a final agreement is signed, and not three years, as previously reported.
Regarding the peace talks' timeframe, the Palestinian president said he was willing to deviate from the original nine-month limit for negotiations marked on April 29.
“It's not a sacred date,” Mr. Abbas said. “Suppose by the end of nine months we got something promising. Shall I stop? I will not stop. If, after nine months, we didn't get anything, if there is nothing on the horizon, we will stop.”

LAHORE: As many as 15 independent power producers (IPPs) have started invoking their sovereign guarantees to recover their unpaid bills of more than Rs66 billion by serving final notice on the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) and the government.
Sources said that notices were served on Tuesday after the failure of the government to “pay off the debt in two weeks as promised by Water and Power Minister Khawaja Asif” in his meeting with IPP officials on May 29.
The producers that have served final notices include the IPPs established under the 1994 power policy – Lal Pir Power (Rs4.36bn), Pakgen Power (Rs4.17bn) and KEL Power (Rs2.22bn) – and the ones set up under the 2002 power policy – Liberty Power (Rs8.27bn), Nishat Power (Rs7.43bn), Attock Gen Power (Rs7.28bn), Atlas Power (Rs7.24bn), Nishat Chunian Power (Rs6.97bn), Hubco Narowal (Rs4.09bn), Saif Power (Rs3.41bn), Engro Power (Rs3bn), Sapphire Power (Rs2.50bn) and Orient Power (Rs1.15bn).
Rouch Power (Rs4.05bn) and Saba Power (Rs1m) have already initiated the process as a matter of routine under the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the government.
This is the second time that IPPs have initiated process to revoke their sovereign guarantees for recovery of their unpaid bills, which is referred to as inter-corporate debt of power sector or more commonly as circular debt. If the government fails to pay off the debt in one month, the IPPs will have the right to get sovereign guarantees encashed under their PPAs.
In 2012, eight IPPs had initiated process for invoking sovereign guarantees. It led to a legal battle between power companies and the government and their outstanding bills were paid off partly under the court orders.
The Nawaz Sharif government had paid the inter-corporate debt of Rs480bn on the working day of financial year 2012/13, a month after returning to power with a pledge to never let the debt build up again. The payment of the debt had pushed the fiscal deficit for the previous year to 8.2 per cent of domestic output from the 6.5pc.
The debt re-emerged again and rose to around Rs300bn despite a hefty increase in electricity prices for domestic, industrial and commercial consumers.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has refused to fund this debt to contain the fiscal deficit for the present year to 5.7pc to perhaps meet the most crucial condition of the $6.7bn loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
According to the sources, the government had to pay Rs141bn to IPPs set up under the 1994 power policy and Rs59bn to the IPPs established under the 2002 policy. The unpaid bills of GENCOs, etc., stood at Rs98bn.

“Church Handbooks: The Written Order of Things,” Ensign, September 2015, 60–65
As we follow the handbooks and use the collective wisdom they offer, the Lord will help us and those we serve to become “complete in him.”

As a returned missionary, busy with a young family and my own company, I was called to be the president of a good-sized branch with many faithful and mature members. Did I feel prepared, trained, and educated to start serving? No! I had good counselors with whom I could discuss issues. But was their help enough? No!
The Lord expects “every man [to] learn his duty” (D&C 107:99), and He expects us to “treasure up in [our] minds … the words of [God]” (D&C 84:85). Then He expects us to trust the inspiration of the Holy Ghost﻿—that special gift given to all members with the promise of continued guidance and revelation.
Thinking back on that calling and on other callings, I realize that in addition to the Holy Ghost and the scriptures, what really helped me were the Church handbooks! They were a treasure of information﻿—as a guide to my initial learning and as a valuable reference along the way.
Why Do We Need the Church Handbooks? Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has taught, “While [the] handbooks do not have the same standing as the scriptures, they do represent the most current interpretations and procedural directions of the Church's highest authorities.”1 President Russell M. Nelson, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, added that those authorities﻿—the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles﻿—are men of “seasoned maturity, experience, and extensive preparation.”2 Thus, the Church handbooks reflect the collective wisdom﻿—derived from tested, proven experiences﻿—of prophets and apostles. That wisdom teaches us the best way to achieve good results in carrying out the mission of the Church over time. The Lord has counseled, “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom” (D&C 88:118; 109:7). Certainly, the wisdom in the handbooks qualifies them as “best books.”
The Handbooks Help Us Maintain Policies, Procedures, and Programs President Thomas S. Monson has declared that without the handbooks, “it would be nearly impossible to maintain the integrity of the policies, procedures, and programs of the Church.” He added, “Over the years, we've had to correct many attempts by well-meaning leaders to change some of the programs of the Church.” President Monson said that when leaders do not correctly follow procedures, “the First Presidency must ratify the action or have it redone.” In other words, if we ignore the handbooks, we may end up adding to the workload of the First Presidency. “In almost all cases,” he said, “if the leaders would only read, understand, and follow the handbook, such problems would not occur. … There is safety in the handbooks.”3 President Monson added that whatever our leadership calling is, the handbooks contain a treasure of information and guidance that help us minister effectively, understand the proper functioning of the Church, learn and fulfill our duties (see D&C 107:99), and prepare for future leadership positions.
The Handbooks Teach What Is Essentially The handbooks teach that while “parents have the vital responsibility to help their children prepare to return to Heavenly Father,” the Savior's “Church provides the organization and means for teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to all of God's children.” The handbooks also teach that the Church “provides the priesthood authority to administer the ordinances of salvation and exaltation to all who are worthy and willing to accept them.”4 The doctrinal framework for administering the Church is found in the first three chapters of Handbook 2: Administering the Church: Families and the Church in God's Plan Priesthood Principles Leadership in the Church of Jesus Christ We should study these three chapters carefully. They remind us that the Church “was organized by God to assist in His work to bring to pass the salvation and exaltation of His children.”5 It does this through activities, opportunities, and programs for service, blessing, and personal growth that focus on divinely appointed responsibilities which support and strengthen individuals and families. These responsibilities “include helping members live the gospel of Jesus Christ, gathering Israel through missionary work, caring for the poor and needy, and enabling salvation for the dead by building temples and performing vicarious ordinances.”6 As we understand this doctrinal framework, the purpose and role of all callings in the Church becomes clear: “Priesthood and auxiliary leaders and teachers strive to help others become true followers of Jesus Christ.” Further, “Church organizations and programs exist to bless individuals and families and are not ends in themselves.”7 The handbooks are doctrinally based in the scriptures, including the Savior's admonition to Peter: “When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren” (Luke 22:32).
The Handbooks Facilitate Revelation While helping a less-active member return to the Church, the member's bishop reviewed the chapter on Church discipline in Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops. Then, after speaking with his stake presidency, the bishop decided to hold a disciplinary council. “We met beforehand as a bishopric and reviewed the handbook to remind ourselves of proper procedures and to identify points relevant to the case at hand,” the bishop said. “We felt strongly the Spirit of the Lord assisting us as we conversed with the member.” Later, after the bishopric had prayed for the Lord's help, one of the counselors felt impressed that they should again read aloud the relevant portions of Handbook 1. When they had finished, the bishop asked each counselor what he recommended. “Bishop, you might be surprised, but this is what I feel,” said the first counselor in making his recommendation. The second counselor felt the same, as did the bishop. “Reading the handbook to each other allowed the Spirit to enlighten our minds,” the bishop recalled. “The principles became clearer as to how they related to this situation, and each of us was guided to the same answer. We were well prepared to provide appropriate counsel to help our dear brother come back to Christ.” As this bishopric discovered, the instructions found in the Church handbooks “can facilitate revelation if they are used to provide an understanding of principles, policies, and procedures to apply while seeking the guidance of the Spirit.”8
The Handbooks Help Us Bless Those We Serve As we read, understand, and follow the handbooks, they become a blessing to those we serve.9 A policy change outlined in Handbook 2, for example, helped a bishop bless and strengthen one father who thought he would be unable to ordain his 12-year-old son to the Aaronic Priesthood. Chapter 20 states, “Bishops and stake presidents have discretion to allow priesthood holders who are not fully temple worthy to perform or participate in some ordinances and blessings,” including baptisms and Aaronic Priesthood ordinations.10 Without a temple recommend, this father thought he would be unable to ordain his son. But his bishop, “as guided by the Spirit,”11 granted permission following an interview. “That experience became a turning point in his life,” his current bishop noted. “It was part of the process of his becoming temple worthy, of being sealed with his wife in the temple, and of having their children sealed to them.”
Flexibility and Adaptation﻿—within Proper Boundaries Maintaining uniformity in Church principles, policies, and procedures “will bring the influence of the Holy Ghost into the lives of leaders and members,” said Elder Quentin L. Cook of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.12 But in a worldwide Church where members face a variety of political, social, and economic conditions, some branches and wards may lack sufficient membership, leadership, and resources to carry out the full program of the Church. Other units may face issues related to security, transportation, communication, and family economic circumstances. Chapter 17 in Handbook 2 clarifies “where uniformity is required” as well as the “circumstances that may permit local adaptation” in the staffing and programs of auxiliaries and in the format and frequency of leadership meetings and activities. Adaptation should be done, of course, only after leaders seek guidance from the Holy Ghost.13 As they do so, “all wards and branches, regardless of their size or circumstances, can experience the same abundance of the Spirit of the Lord.”14
The Written Order of Things The handbooks provide us with what could be called a “written order of things.” Handbook 1, available to bishops and stake presidents, outlines “the general responsibilities of stake presidents and bishops” and provides “detailed information about policies and procedures,”15 ranging from temples, marriage, and missionary service to welfare, Church discipline, and finances. Handbook 2, available (including on LDS.org) to all Church leaders, reduces the complexity of Church programs while allowing, as noted above, for flexibility and some local adaptation. It “is a guide for members of ward and stake councils”16 and their auxiliaries in administering the Church and its work of salvation. The collective wisdom found in the handbooks is organized in such a way that it can be easily accessed and used to create a true service culture that should exist in all wards and stakes of the Savior's Church. But to access that wisdom, we must study the handbooks, learn from them, internalize their principles, and put those principles into practice! The result will be light, understanding, and the long-term blessing of discovering the best way to serve our brothers and sisters. Regarding our service in the Church, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, Second Counselor in the First Presidency, has observed: “As we extend our hands and hearts toward others in Christlike love, something wonderful happens to us. Our own spirits become healed, more refined, and stronger. We become happier, more peaceful, and more receptive to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit.”17
After 17 National Hockey League seasons playing for five teams that provided him with every piece of equipment he needed, tough guy forward Donald Brashear had an epiphany – and a case of sticker shock – when he had to buy a hockey stick.
“I was retired for five years, so when I ran out of sticks and I went to buy one at a store, I thought the sticks were so expensive,” Brashear told me recently. “Even though I have money, it didn't make sense for me to pay 300 bucks for a stick just to play in the beer league.”
That breath-gasping experience launched Brashear on a mission to manufacture and sell professional-caliber, carbon fiber, high-performance hockey sticks at an affordable price.
The result was Brash 87, an upstart business that sells Brashear-designed sticks for players of all levels. He's priced them between $129 (CAN) and $189 (CAN) – roughly $103 to $151 (USD) – about half the cost of name-brand sticks.
Brashear is the latest individual or company to venture into the lucrative and ultra-competitive hockey stick business. In 2013, STX, a Baltimore-based lacrosse, field hockey, and golf equipment maker branched off into ice hockey sticks.
In 2000, golf club shaft-maker True got into the hockey stick biz and has sold more than two million twigs since. But big-name hockey companies continue to be the big dogs. Bauer, for example, has an estimated 54 percent of the hockey equipment market – which includes sticks.
Brashear says he's not out to conquer the hockey stick-making world. He just wants a small piece of the planet.
“It's like you're drinking Pepsi-Cola and then there's a new company that shows up and says ‘Listen, I want to take one percent of that market,'” he told me. “If I can get one percent of what that company is making, that's a lot of money.”
Brashear began his quest slowly. First, he searched for a reliable manufacturer in China who could make sticks to his specifications. After personally putting prototype sticks through their paces, he began selling the sticks around hometown Quebec City and at a Toronto-area Canadian Tire store.
“In six months, eight months, I sold like close to 3,000 sticks with no marketing, no advertising, no nothing. Only word of mouth,” he told me. “I hit two markets: the parents who don't want to pay for a stick that's too expensive and the beer league player who wants a high-performance stick.”
He's become a traveling salesman of sorts, lugging a few Brash 87's with him to rinks around Quebec City where he plays hockey five times a week.
“I bring my sticks, other players take them and they realize ‘That's a nice stick, it's light,'” Brashear said. “I say ‘Why don't you try it?' They try it and they adopt it.”
Now Brashear is looking to expand. He pitched his wares earlier this month before the panelists of CBC's “Dragons' Den,” Canada's equivalent to CNBC's popular “Shark Tank” business reality television show. The episode should air in the upcoming season.
“The ultimate goal is to build a high-performance stick to help people save money on sticks,” he said. “It's not something I'm doing to become a millionaire. It's something I'm doing where I'm helping people and helping me at the same time.”
Some fans might think Brashear's desire to sell hockey sticks a bit odd. After all, he was a player known more for his fists than his scoring touch. In 1,025 NHL games, Brashear tallied 85 goals, 120 assists and a whopping 2,634 penalty minutes – most of them accumulated five minutes at a time as one of the league's fiercest and most-feared fighters.
The website dropyourgloves.com calculates that Brashear had 390 fights during his hockey career – 277 of them while playing for the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, Philadelphia Flyers, Washington Capitals, and New York Rangers. He spent enough time in the sin bin that he's ranked 15th all-time in penalty minutes among NHL players.
“A lot of people know me as a guy that was fighting but knew how to play the game, that could score a goal once in a while, and could make some passes,” said Brashear, an Indiana-born French-Canadian. “If you look at my stats, I fight but I was also picking up points.”
Brashear had the ability to light the lamp. He was second in scoring on the Fredericton Canadiens -Montreal's American Hockey League farm team in 1993-94 – with 38 goals and 28 assists while amassing 250 penalty minutes. He had an NHL career-high 28 points – 9 goals, 19 assists – for the Canucks in 2000-2001.
One of his most satisfying seasons was when he scored 25 points – 8 goals, 17 assists – with the Flyers in 2002-03 as a fourth-line player with right wing Sami Kapanen and center Keith Primeau.
“That was a fun year, I really liked it,” Brashear told me. “I always wanted to be in different situations, and I was used in different situations. I wanted to become a better player.”
He added: “I shot a lot of pucks and I know a lot about hockey sticks. I would watch (Capitals forward Alex) Ovechkin make a move and I would try to make the same one. It would take me two years before I would be able to, but in the end I would get it.”
But toughness remains Brashear's calling card. When his young players were being pushed around in the Swedish Hockey League last season, Modo Assistant General Manager Peter Forsberg telephoned his then 42-year-old former Flyers teammate Brashear and asked him to hop a plane and suit up.
“I said ‘Peter, I've been retired for five years. Yeah, I play a lot of hockey, but I'm not in game shape like going 100 miles an hour like these kids now in Europe,'” Brashear recalled. “I said ‘We're not allowed to fight.' He said ‘No, but your presence there is going to make a big difference.'”
Brashear's Modo stat line: 12 regular season games, no points and six penalty minutes. He had a goal, no assists, and two penalty minutes in four playoff games. He was a fan favorite during his nearly three-month stint in Sweden.
“I really enjoyed it…I kind of wish right after my career I had the chance to go play there to get better at the game there,” he said. “There's so much skating, passing the puck. It's not so much physical.”

One of the perennial ideas of metaphysical and spiritual philosophies throughout the ages is the assertion that in the non-physical realms, where our higher selves exist, time as we know it does not exist — that our experience of linear time here in our physical reality is an ILLUSION

Cosmic Consciousness
The Infinite Information Matrix
The Cosmic Film Projector
The Illusion of Continuity
"If you time-travel to the time of your grandfather and kill him before he has any children, then your father would not have been born, and then you would not have been born. And if you were never born, you could not go back to kill your grandfather."
Paranormal Phenomena and the Illusion of Time and Space
Reality is a Construct and We Are Its Creator
A broad alliance of technology companies, including Google(s goog), Apple(s aapl), Microsoft(s msft) and Samsung, has asked European authorities to fix the rules for an EU-wide Unified Patent Court ahead of its launch, in order to fend off patent trolls.
These tech giants are no strangers to patent wars — their global skirmishes have touched on Europe on a number of occasions. But this isn't about such titanic conflicts – it's about so-called trolls; companies that don't actually make anything themselves, but that rather buy up patents and use them to turn practicing tech firms (particularly small, defenseless ones) into cash machines.

These bullying tactics are all too familiar in the U.S., largely because the U.S. allows relatively abstract concepts to be patented. In the European Union, software patents are not granted quite so freely, but the big tech firms still worry about the rules that will apply under a new patent regime that will launch in 2014.
Unification risks
Europe has been trying to unify its patent system for a good three decades, largely on the basis of cost – it is crazily expensive to get a patent that applies everywhere in Europe, because it means applying in dozens of countries, many with their own languages.
At the end of last year, the European Parliament finally approved an EU-wide patent system. Part of this will involve the ability to apply once and win patent protection everywhere in the EU, but another major strand is the creation of a Unified Patent Court (UPC), which will do away with the need for parallel patent litigation in different national courts. The UPC will however comprise multiple courts itself.
It's the UPC's rules that Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, Google, HP(s hpq), BlackBerry(s bbry), Cisco(s csco), Deutsche Telekom, Intel(s intc), Yahoo(s yhoo) and others (it really is quite the roster) are worried about. Specifically two things:
Bifurcation: Under the UPC Agreement, different courts will be able to judge on two strands of a case, namely the validity of the patent and whether or not it was infringed. The tech companies are worried that the holder of a low-quality, over-general patent might be able to win a quick infringement ruling in a friendly jurisdiction, before the other court has established whether the patent is rubbish.
Under the UPC Agreement, different courts will be able to judge on two strands of a case, namely the validity of the patent and whether or not it was infringed. The tech companies are worried that the holder of a low-quality, over-general patent might be able to win a quick infringement ruling in a friendly jurisdiction, before the other court has established whether the patent is rubbish. Injunctions: The companies also think the rules aren't clear enough about the threshold for injunctions, particularly as an injunction could now apply across the whole EU, rather than just in one country.
As Google explained in a blog post on Thursday:
“The economic impact of patent troll litigation [in the U.S.] has been enormous, draining an estimated $29 billion in direct costs from productive enterprises in 2011 alone. Over the years Google has faced down hundreds of patent claims, mostly from patent trolls, but only after paying millions of dollars in legal fees. “Europe now has a clear opportunity to adopt rules that limit the risk of fostering patent trolling in Europe. Patent trolls have no real business interests to defend. So, at the very least, trolls should have to prove their patents are actually valid and consumer harms should be considered before giving trolls blocking orders that would impact 500 million Europeans.”
These are valid concerns. As we have seen in Germany with the Apple-Motorola battle in particular, patent disputes have led to popular products being removed from store shelves, albeit very briefly. That kind of disruption could be hugely magnified once one patent ruling applies across the EU, so it's very important to get this stuff right before the system lurches into action.
I've asked the office of Michel Barnier, the internal market commissioner who has shepherded the creation of the UPC, for comment on the tech firms' concerns, and will add it in as and when I receive it.
Cuts through the rain like a rabid Samurai! Probably my favorite purchase from Amazon. Every time I take this out for use in public (where it rains), I always get curious looks and sometimes a question or two. Everyone leaves happier. I don't see too many umbrellas out there improving people's moods.
Aside from the looks, the product itself is durable and effective. I've had it for a couple of years now and have not had any major issues. The only problem I had is that the tip near the top broke off at some point, probably because I was leaning on it or smashed it into something in the subway. For the price, some would say that's unacceptable, but whatever. The way I see it, I would have gone through 5 or 6 $10 umbrellas (probably more) during the time I've had this so it's giving me more value than I'd expected. It's also large enough for two people to get under it so that's an extra umbrella saved right there.
The carrying case it comes with is also handy - just throw it over your shoulder and everyone automatically gives you respect as if they fear your life-taking skills. If only they knew.
I'm not quite sure what it was that got me psyched to plan a trip to El Potrero Chico… Was it the jagged limestone peaks of the Sierra Madres? Was it because Alex Honnold had been there? Or was it the rumor of a small white chihuahua named Scooby.
It was Scooby.
Ben, Zach, and I threw our bags into the back of my mom's Prius and sped off to Mexico. We were all skipping the holidays with our families for a three week climbing trip in another country. (Sorry family). Google Maps predicted the drive to be nineteen hours. Oh, if only. I would love to say that our boarder crossing into Mexico was easy and relaxing, but quite frankly, it did tremendous psychological damage to all of us, and even with years of therapy and rehabilitation, we will never be able to truly recover. It was a true test of character and really made us question our life choices. The six lane highway at Laredo bridge was completely packed with cars that stretched for miles. It took us a grueling and painful 9 hours just to cross the boarder and get our travel visas. It is really funny how I thought that nothing could be worse than the DMV, but the Mexican boarder office takes the cake. And what horrible place would be complete without a screaming child? And this wasn't just any screaming child, this child was… The worst child on the planet. This punk-ass toddler was running around, crying hysterically, screaming at the top of her lungs, stomping her feet, and clapping while her parents did nothing. I don't want to talk about this any more. On to the climbing.
After 31 unfortunate hours, we made it to El Potrero Chico.
Our friend Mike had found us a place to stay in the middle of town right across from the climber hangout/coffee shop, The Buho. It was a small apartment that even had a bathroom and electricity, and enough space for our whole crew of 6. The main campsite in Potrero was super full, and it was so nice to have a place to stay that was away from the crowds of other climbers. And it was only $13 a person for the month!
On our second day, after being somewhat recovered from our traumatic boarder crossing, we tried Time Wave Zero 23 pitches (5.12a). 90% of the climbing is super easy, and Zach and I were able to simul-climb the first 8 pitches until we got rained out. We didn't end up trying it again because the climbing wasn't all that great, and there were so many people going to climb that route. Due to the huge influx of gumbies on the multipitches, we focused on harder single pitch climbing for the duration of the trip.
The trip was a welcome change from our usual short weekend trips. We had more time to rest, explore the town, try some of the local restaurants, and practice our spanish at the local Tuesday markets. One of our favorite restaurants was “Faceburger”, which literally the kitchen of some families house. The burgers were as big as your face, and came with baskets of fresh fries. While it definitely was not the most authentic Mexican food, it was pretty damn good after a day of climbing. And I will admit that it was insane to watch Ben eat the whole thing… And then hustle back to our bathroom at a swift pace.
After a week climbing in Potrero, we decided to head up to El Salto for some cooler temps. We heard that the climbing was amazing, and decided to spend a few days in the mountains during Christmas. We left early in the morning to avoid rush hour, which thankfully made the drive only slightly terrifying. After miles of steep winding roads, and definitely not bottoming out on any speed bumps, we rolled in to Cienega De Gonzales. We set up camp in the yard of a lady named Dona Kika, which was a great chance to meet local climbers from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
The climbing in El Salto is world class. The Las Animas wall is the main crag with over 60 routes. Las Animas wall is huge wall of beautifully streaked, and incredibly featured limestone. It was all of our first experiences climbing on tufas before and it did not dissapoint. Although it was a new style to get used to, it was a blast getting pumped out of my mind and taking some big clean falls. The climbing in El Salto is so 3-Dimensional, it mades each route one-of-a-kind.
The next day we hiked a little farther down the creek bed to check out the Tecalote cave. It's super steep, loaded with stalactites, and has some really hard climbs. The routes were out of this world and just plain fun to climb.
On the right side of the cave, Ben and I climbed what was quite possibly the sickest 5.10 ever. It was called “Culo De Merin”, or “Merlin's Asshole (a lovely name) and it climbed through a horizontal tunnel, and up into a cave. It felt like caving. We rappelled out of the cave with huge grins.
Later that night (Christmas Eve), Dona Kika invited all the climbers to her families party. She had made hundreds of tamales, (which were by far the best tamales any of us had ever had), shared beers and maybe a little to much tequila. I would say it was a great night if some of the locals didn't build a huge fire and BLAST music at our tents all night long until the sun came up; and the tequila didn't help.
We headed back to Potrero to meet up with the rest of our Boulder crew of Max, Shannon, and Ben, who thankfully had an easier boarder crossing than we did. We climbed the next few days and got to spend New Years at the big climber party in one of the local campgrounds. it was really cool to see how many psyched climbers from all around the world come out to Potrero. There was even a DJ and even a mechanical bull. It was pretty fun, but we didn't feel like staying up later than midnight.
We did end up hitting a bit of rainy weather on our trip, but we were still able to find places to climb. We got to get off the beaten path to check out some of the more obscure areas which provided us with some spiney jungle adventure. We checked out several of the overhanging walls at Potrero, and even an underground bouldering cave where your headlamp was the only source of light. It was really rad!
El Potrero Chico is massive, and in our time there we were only barely able to scratch the surface of all the climbing. The rock is all limestone, but is featured with all kinds of different holds which makes for really interesting climbing. There is also SO much potential for new routes, so if you want to nab some FA's, go to Potrero!
After nearly 3 weeks of climbing, barbacoa tacos, and margaritas, we decided to end our trip with 2 more days climbing in El Salto. I definitely felt stronger since the first time we went, and was able to put down a route that had given me a lot of trouble. And Ben sent his first 13b! it was even during the hottest part of the day, unreal! It was a great way to end the trip with all six of us, and it was awesome to say bye to Zach and Shannon before they started their huge road trip.
I think I can speak for our Boulder Crew that the trip to Potrero has been hands down the best climbing trip we have ever been on. We got introduced to a new style of limestone, we all made a ton of friends from over the world, nobody got hurt, and nobody even got sick. I'm sure I will be back one day, but I also heard that Chonta Cave in Mexico City is even sicker.
Am I really going to conclude with a picture of a sunset? That is so chiche.

NORRISTOWN, Pa. – Montgomery County authorities have arrested a 31-year-old Norristown man who they say ordered a hit on another man because they were involved with the same woman.
It took nearly two years to arrest him, but authorities have now charged Tyuan Simon of Green Street with putting a “dime,” which is street language for $10,000, on the victim's head.
That victim was Tyree Whiting who was murdered in October 2010 after leaving a Norristown bar.
Prosecutor Kevin Steele says Simon, who is already behind bars in state prison, is facing solicitation to commit murder and first degree murder charges.
“When you're an accomplice or you order a hit on somebody,” he said, “you're facing the same murder charges that the actual shooter would.”
The shooter, Bruce Woods, accepted a plea deal to a third degree murder charge and other offenses and is awaiting sentencing. He admitted in court that it was Simon who put out the contract on Whiting.
Simon is now being held at Graterford Prison.
On the much anticipated opening weekend of Interstellar, senior contributing editor Bob Naeye reviews the movie's facts and foibles.
Few films in recent years have intrigued me as much as Interstellar, a highly ambitious movie directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. Trailers and reviews left me curious about the storyline of a future Earth dessicated by dust bowls and dying crops, and voyages beyond our solar system made possible by a wormhole. Most of all, I wondered whether the movie would fall within the realm of science fiction or science fantasy.
By science fiction, I mean movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, in which the filmmakers allow their plots to be constrained by the known laws of physics. In contrast, science fantasy franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars ignore science whenever it gets in the way of entertaining storylines.
To my delight, Interstellar clearly falls within the domain of true sci-fi. The producers were clearly inspired by the science, and they even used the time dilation from Einstein's general theory of relativity to enhance the drama and ask interesting moral questions of the characters. Compared to the vast majority of Hollywood flicks, I give Interstellar high marks for its attempts at scientific realism.
To make a long story short (the movie is nearly 3 hours), Earth is dying and NASA scientists led by Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) realize that humanity needs to find another planet to avoid extinction. And just when the situation turns critical, a wormhole magically shows up near Saturn. Who put the wormhole there, and why, is suggested near the end. It enables spaceships to travel to another galaxy, where they enter a region of space near a black hole named Gargantua and about a dozen potentially habitable planets.
Astronauts sent decades earlier returned information through the wormhole indicating that three worlds are potentially suitable for human habitation. So NASA sends a crew of four to learn more. Piloted by McConaughey's character Cooper and including Brand's daughter Amelia (played by Hathaway) and two others, the spaceship travels through the wormhole to the remote galaxy.
Nolan hired retired Caltech physicist Kip Thorne as a scientific consultant, a role significant enough that he's credited as an executive producer. Thorne helped the filmmakers produce a scientifically plausible wormhole. We don't know whether wormholes exist, but I liked this device for making interstellar travel possible because it doesn't rely on Star Trekkian faster-than-light warp drives, which are physically impossible. The movie's wormhole is visually stunning, but we'll probably never know whether it has any connection to physical reality.
My biggest scientific beef is what happens when the crew arrives in the other galaxy. They travel to the planets themselves, even though they lack sufficient fuel to visit all of them. This sets up interesting discussions among the crew, because they have to decide which planets to visit and in what order. Time is of the essence. Because some of the worlds are deep within the black hole's gravitational well (something that's scientifically preposterous), relativity's time dilation means that visiting those planets would cause the crew to age much slower than the people back on Earth, raising moral dilemmas when the mission's stated objective is to save humanity.
In reality, future astronauts would instead deploy telescopes to study the planets' atmospheres from afar. Using spectroscopy, they could more quickly and efficiently ascertain which worlds have environments most promising for human settlement. NASA could have built such a telescope — the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) — within the next decade if given adequate funding by Congress. And if Cooper's crew deployed a TPF, they could have avoided wasting time on the first two worlds, which were clearly unsuitable for colonization. Of course, bypassing the landings would have robbed the plot of some of its most dramatic moments.
Cooper later takes the spaceship very close to Gargantua, which appears to be a stellar-mass black hole given its size relative to the spaceship. (The movie states that the black hole is supermassive, but that was something that I did not hear because of the film's poor sound quality. Even so, a supermassive black hole would be roughly the size of the solar system, and given the perspective compared with the spaceship, this size wasn't apparent on screen.) The filmmakers took great effort to produce a scientifically accurate rendering of the black hole, including the bending of light. But they neglected to include the Doppler effect and relativistic beaming in the surrounding accretion disk, which would make the approaching gas appear bluer and brighter.
In reality, traveling so close to one of these beasts would be lethal. The movie shows a highly luminous accretion disk of gas, even though there's no obvious source (such as a star) of accreting matter. High-energy X-rays from the disk would literally fry a spacecraft and its human inhabitants. Making matters worse, venturing so close to such a low-mass black hole would subject the crew to spaghettification (an actual scientific term!) as the hole's extreme tidal force would literally stretch a person into an ultrathin strand of protoplasm.
The final part of the movie leaps even further into the realm of scientific implausibility, though I don't want to spoil the ending. I loved the penultimate scene because of its surreal quality (vaguely reminiscent of the stargate sequence from 2001). Interstellar's conclusion lays obvious groundwork for a sequel, but I still found it intellectually and emotionally satisfying.
I liked Interstellar enough that I will see it again. But it's not for everyone, and I understand why reviews are mixed. There are no rock ‘em, sock ‘em battles with aliens. Those wanting to see depictions of alien planets lush with life akin to Avatar's Pandora will be deeply disappointed. Like 2001, the movie leaves many important questions unanswered, which might turn off some viewers.
Despite some obvious parallels to 2001, Interstellar is a very different kind of movie. It's much faster paced, more complex, and features many more characters, who are developed at a much deeper level. Interstellar is a highly original, thought-provoking, and convincingly acted movie about human relationships, especially the one between Cooper and his daughter Murph. There's enough scientific content and accuracy to give it considerable appeal to people with a scientific orientation.
Although I found the movie to be a bit rushed and confusing at times, and I often had difficulty understanding the dialog, it had a deep affect on me, though I find it difficult to explain or encapsulate. None of the reviews I have read fully convey the essence of the movie. If you decide to see it in a theater, I advise you to leave your preconceptions at home, and to not let the scientific inaccuracies bother you.

Early in the Occupy Wall Street movement that has captured global attention, Adam Nelson dropped by New York City's Zuccotti Park to visit friends who were protesting there.
“The news story of the day was the decline of Ray's Pizza, and there wasn't much messaging coming from the park,” says Nelson, who is CEO of Workhouse Publicity.
Nelson shot photos and emailed them to a list of 500,000 subscribers worldwide. Thus he began his pro bono PR work for the movement that blasts corporate greed—and is dominating the news Thursday with its attempts to shut down Wall Street.
The story is as big as it gets from a PR perspective, and Workhouse isn't toiling alone. A committee of protesters is handing communications, creating Facebook pages, tweeting, and fielding calls from the media. But is their message hitting home?
A new opinion poll suggests the public is turning against OWS. Support for its goals, at 35 percent, was lower than for those of the Tea Party, at 42 percent.
Nelson disputes the poll, saying the movement is resonating worldwide and drawing thousands to the streets. But PR pros are divided about the success of its communications.
Canny cultivation of the media
Dorothy Crenshaw, CEO and creative director of Crenshaw Communications, praised OWS's canny cultivation of the media and public sympathy. Mayor Michael Bloomberg's evacuation of Zuccotti Park seems to have strengthened the movement, she suggests. But she sees risks in the protesters' tactics of shutting down streets and subway stations.
She adds: “If they start to disrupt the commute or work schedule of so-called ‘regular people'—part of that huge 99 percent who are just trying to get through the workday and earn a living—I think they risk losing the very group that should be most sympathetic.”
The movement's PR efforts drew derision from Fraser P. Seitel, managing partner of Emerald Partners and author of The Practice of Public Relations. OWS, he says, has “botched an opportunity to capture public opinion and achieve something. Americans, by every measure, distrust the politicians who run Washington and lead major institutions. So public opinion was ripe for the plucking.”
However, the movement blew it by having no overriding purpose, stated goals, or visible leadership, he says, and it is increasingly perceived as a bunch of publicity-hungry complainers intent on disrupting others who are making a living.
“Occupy Wall Street is right about one thing,” he says. “The whole world is watching. And it's generally repulsed by what it's seen.”
Workhouse's Nelson says the on-the-ground movement's messaging is led by a work group dedicated to PR, and it includes people who have backgrounds in communications. “They're very savvy,” Nelson says.
Monitoring Twitter feeds Thursday, Crenshaw noted a savvy use of social media by protesters. It wasn't just slogans and platitudes, she says, but what appeared to be firsthand experiences. Twitter users accused police of roughing up protesters, and @Washingtonpost said officers in Seattle pepper-sprayed an 84-year-old woman named Dorli Rainey.
Messaging through many channels
Reached by phone Thursday, protester Sandra Nurse said the public outreach has been extensive.
“We have great messaging that we've put a ton of work into,” Nurse said. “We've done social media, we've done press releases, we've done fliers. We've done every outlet we could do.”
The media office of the New York Stock Exchange, which OWS is seeking to shut down, declined to comment.
Peter Himler, of Flatiron Communications, says the movement fails from a PR perspective on a number of basic points. Typically, when a PR firm works with a client, you come up with the tangible business results you'd like to see; then you devise a strategy of press, content creation, or events.
OWS hasn't decided what specific action it wants to achieve, he says.
“Other than the grousing about we don't like the banks, we don't like the government—I don't know what the specific demands are,” says Himler, who has blogged about the movement from a PR point of view. “It's a very unorthodox campaign whose primary goal, it seems to me, is just keeping the Occupy Wall Street protesters in the media, on television. … But the coverage is the end for them, not the means to the end.”
On the contrary, says Workhouse's Nelson. The messaging has caught fire worldwide.
“All of these [protests] are symbolic,” he says. “All of these are to keep it front-page, top-of-mind, international news. And they have accomplished that. What started as youth in a park is now a global movement… in 951 cities and so many countries. And it grows every day.”
Workhouse lists clients such as Virgin Megastore, Interview Magazine, and the Rubin Museum of Art. Some might be shy about working with a firm that takes on a controversial movement, but Nelson says his clients haven't minded.
“I don't think that Occupy Wall Street was saying that big brands shouldn't live,” Nelson says. “I don't think that they were saying that nobody should shop at Macy's. What they were really saying that everybody's entitled to the same things: a job, family, relief from economic injustice. It's the idea that we're all one layoff away from joining youth in a park.”

On most days, it was not uncommon to see visiting NBA players sitting in the seats at Hofheinz Pavilion.
Crowds would come to watch practice - the type of following that made the University of Houston's famed Phi Slama Jama teams of the 1980s a national phenomenon.
"It was like being with the Beatles," Clyde Drexler, a star guard on UH's greatest teams, said.
Phi Slama Jama, featuring future Hall-of-Famers Drexler and Akeem (later Hakeem) Olajuwon, introduced a fastbreak, above-the-rim style that made dunks as trendy as denim jackets and corduroy pants. The Cougars made three straight Final Four appearances in 1982, '83 and '84, twice losing in the national championship game.
"Everywhere we went, people would meet us at our hotel or get to the arena early to see the dunk show in warmups," Drexler said. "It was a cult following. It wasn't just from the University of Houston people, but from people around the world. I always thought that was incredible. You'll probably never see that again."
Dunks, dunks and more dunks. It's a word that became synonymous with UH basketball and part of the Cougars' DNA.
More Information Phi Slama Jama By the numbers: 31: Wins for the Cougars in the 1982-83 season. The team lost only three games; one was the NCAA championship. 18:The average number of points the Cougars beat their opponents by in 1982-83. 200: The Cougars are estimated to have dunked more than 200 times in the 1982-83 season. 88-16: Overall record for Phi Slama Jama. 3: Trips to the Final Four. 6: All-Americans. 10: Players selected in the NBA draft.

"We strived for dunks," center Greg Anderson said years later. "If we get out on the break, we're running for a dunk."
Phi Slama Jama helped usher in a new era in college basketball with a high-flying, throw-down dunking style that had seldom been seen. The NCAA banned the dunk from 1967 to 1976. Six years later, Phi Slama Jama - influenced by the defunct ABA and Julius Erving of the 1970s - unveiled a brand of dunking that would become its calling card.
"I think we were right at the turning point the way the game changed and evolved into the game it is today," forward Michael Young said.
What made Phi Slama Jama so effective, Drexler said, was the teams were "fundamentally sound" and had a coach in Guy V. Lewis who was able to mesh so much talent and personalities.
Of course, it always came back to putting on a show for crowds.
"We could play basketball," Drexler, fittingly nicknamed "The Glide," added, "but we also had a degree of showmanship and entertainment."
Lewis, inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013, was a champion of dunks, calling them "high-percentage shots."
"(Phi Slama Jama) was a golden era in college basketball and one that the University of Houston and Guy Lewis had been chasing for a long time since the great Elvin Hayes teams," Drexler said.
Drexler credits Rob Williams and Larry Micheaux, a pair of homegrown players, as the "catalysts" who started Phi Slama Jama. From there, "Texas' Tallest Fraternity" would assemble a cast of stars that included Drexler, Akeem "The Dream" Olajuwon, Larry "Mr. Mean" Micheaux, Michael "Silent Assassin" Young, Greg "Cadillac" Anderson, Reid Gettys, Benny Anders, Alvin Franklin, Ricky Winslow, Dave Rose and Lynden Rose.
During its three-year run, Phi Slama Jama had 14 Houston-area players on the roster, including Drexler, who attended Sterling High School, and Young, the state's player of the year from Yates. Olajuwon arrived from Nigeria before the 1981-82 season.
"So the joke always was Coach Lewis could have recruited on his bicycle," Gettys said.
Thomas Bonk, a columnist for the Houston Post, coined the nickname Phi Slama Jama after a non-conference game against Pacific. Bonk counted 29 dunks in the 112-58 win.
On Jan. 3, 1983, Phi Slama Jama was born:
"As members of the exclusive college roundball fraternity Phi Slama Jama, the Houston chapter has learned proper parliamentary procedure."
"That was such an interesting team, I'd go hang out at their practices," Bonk recalled. "It was a magical time. They were so quotable, so much fun to watch. They deserved a great nickname."
The nickname was an instant hit. T-shirts were made. Fans brought signs to arenas. Later that season, players began to don the signature nylon Phi Slama Jama jackets during pre-game warmups.
"It was catchy," Young said. "The name fit."
In 1982, UH lost in the national semifinal game to Michael Jordan and North Carolina, 68-63.
The national semifinal game on April 2, 1983, between Phi Slama Jama and Louisville's Doctors of Dunk is still regarded as one of the greatest NCAA Tournament games of all time. No. 1 vs. No. 2.
Houston had 13 dunks, 11 coming in the second half, to erase an eight-point deficit and beat Louisville 94-81. Olajuwon, who had 21 points, 22 rebounds and eight dunks, called it "a game you remember for a lifetime."
"I've never seen a dunking display like that during a real game," Louisville's Scooter McCray said afterward.
Ironically, in the national championship game, it would be a dunk that would deliver the biggest gut-punch in program history. Lorenzo Charles' putback dunk at the buzzer sent North Carolina State to a 54-52 win that remains one of the biggest upsets in NCAA history.
Drexler left early for the NBA. The following year, led by All-Americans Olajuwon and Young, the Cougars returned to the national championship game. Again, the Cougars came up short, losing to Patrick Ewing and Georgetown, 84-75.
Olajuwon left school a year early and was the No. 1 pick of the Rockets; Young went in the first round to the Boston Celtics.
Phi Slama Jama was no more.
More than three decades later, Young said it's still tough not winning a national title. But he also puts the achievement of reaching three straight Final Four appearances in perspective.
"I don't think people understand how tough it is to get to the Final Four," Young said. "It's not an easy task.
"Of course we wanted to win at least one. I'm still proud of us as a team, and I know all my teammates feel the same way."
TONY Abbott is under pressure to justify a claim to primary school students that it was considerably warmer when Jesus was alive than it is today.
The Opposition Leader urged year 5 and 6 students at Trinity Gardens Primary School in Adelaide to be sceptical about the human contribution to climate change, saying it was an open question.
During a question-and-answer session on Friday, Mr Abbott said that it was warmer ''at the time of Julius Caesar and Jesus of Nazareth'' than now.
Leading scientists said there was no evidence to suggest the globe was hotter 2000 years ago. Australian Academy of Science president Kurt Lambeck said true scepticism was fine, but required looking at published data with an open mind.
''To make these glib statements to school students, I think, is wrong,'' Professor Lambeck said.

Postal worker rescues 15 live baby chicks from the mail after woman gets 'pranked' by ex-boyfriend

Unfortunately for 15 baby chickens who were rescued from the mail by a USPS postal worker this week, one Washington D.C. woman's ex-boyfriend decided to forgo these traditional post-breakup coping strategies in favour of "pranking" her with an unusual delivery.
According to Maryland's
Unimpressed with the strange gesture, she told the postal worker that she planned to throw the newborn birds into the garbage.
That's when the postal worker offered to take them off her hands.
Fortunately, the woman obliged, allowing the postal worker to bring the animals to the Washington Humane Society instead.
Now 11 days old, nine of the chicks are living at Poplar Spring while six more are being taken care of by the
Peaceful Fields wrote on Facebook that all six of the chicks it received on Nov. 8 are "happy and healthy." From posing with hot strangers on Instagram to putting everything they've ever left at your house up on Craigslist, there are plenty of ways to let an ex know that you're (at least kind of) over them — most of which don't involve putting live animals into the mail.Unfortunately for 15 baby chickens who were rescued from the mail by a USPS postal worker this week, one Washington D.C. woman's ex-boyfriend decided to forgo these traditional post-breakup coping strategies in favour of "pranking" her with an unusual delivery.According to Maryland's Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary , an unidentified woman recently received 15 baby chicks in the mail along with a note from her ex-boyfriend that read "There are lots of other chicks out there."Unimpressed with the strange gesture, she told the postal worker that she planned to throw the newborn birds into the garbage.That's when the postal worker offered to take them off her hands.Fortunately, the woman obliged, allowing the postal worker to bring the animals to the Washington Humane Society instead.Now 11 days old, nine of the chicks are living at Poplar Spring while six more are being taken care of by the Peaceful Fields Sanctuary in Virginia.Peaceful Fields wrote on Facebook that all six of the chicks it received on Nov. 8 are "happy and healthy."

Poplar Spring is also sharing Facebook updates regarding the chicks — all of which are "very active and healthy" save for one chick that "has an injured leg, but is recovering."

Indeed, according to the United States Postal Service's list of " "Unbelievably it is legal to ship baby chicks in the regular mail, and often this results in injuries or death to the babies," wrote Poplar Springs in an update, addressing a question that many have been asking this week as the story of the mailed chicks goes viral.Indeed, according to the United States Postal Service's list of " mailable live animals " day-old chickens, ducks, emus, geese, guinea fowl, partridges, pheasants, quail, and turkeys are all "acceptable for mailing when properly packaged."
And yes, it IS LEGAL to ship 15 baby chicks to your ex. Not advisable, but legal. @wusa9 http://t.co/bSFzHo4ioIDebra Alfarone

A USPS spokesperson said at the time that the chicks were killed by extreme heat during their journey.

"Yesterday I was at the post office and heard the familiar sound of newly hatched chicks. They were calling out from inside a pair of cardboard boxes on the counter. No mama. No food. No water. Yes, the shipping of live, day-old baby chicks is a booming business in the States," reads the petition. "It's quite hard to believe that this business is perfectly legal." This is not the first time USPS's rules regarding the mailing of chicks has come under criticism. Change.org petition calling for an end to the practice sprung up in 2012 after it was reported that 1,000 chicks had died while being shipped by mail from Iowa to Kentucky.A USPS spokesperson said at the time that the chicks were killed by extreme heat during their journey. more recent petition with nearly 75,000 supporters beckons the owners of a business that sells live chickens to stop shipping baby birds to its customers by mail."Yesterday I was at the post office and heard the familiar sound of newly hatched chicks.

Monday saw arguably the most asinine debate by British parliamentarians that has ever been held in Westminster Hall. The debate was triggered by an online petition having obtained 573,971 signatures in favor of banning Donald Trump from entry to the U.K.”as if 0.9% of the British population taking to the Internet to voice their hurt feelings is either new or significant.
Chaired by Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West and professional border-denying socialist quisling, this three-hour-long borefest made me truly embarrassed and ashamed to be British.
Just minutes into the debate, former Conservative minister Andrew Murrison referred to Trump as a “ridiculous individual,” much to the amusement of our MPs, as if 20-something-thousand liberals and immigrants voting for them gives them the moral high ground and vast, incontestable, and incontrovertible knowledge that the average British person could only dream of being blessed with.
The entire thing reeked of self-righteousness and arrogance, but what's new there? Save yourself three hours and take a look at the seven stupidest things said by British politicians during this debate.
(1) “Freedom of speech is not an absolute.”
Jack Dromey, Labour MP, Birmingham, Erdington
Jack Dromey, once the chair of the National Council for Civil Liberties, gave us an insight into his idea of a society that embraced civil liberties and freedom. As well as boasting about his previous chairmanship of the NCCL, Dromey told us that “freedom of speech is not an absolute.”
What a bizarre world Dromey must live in, where it's wrong to allow people to voice their legitimate concerns about immigration, but right to lower the age of consent to 10 and to support the rights of pedophiles.
“The entire thing reeked of self-righteousness and arrogance, but what's new there?”
Minutes of a meeting held by the executive committee of the NCCL in 1976 were leaked by The Sun in 2014, and showed the group agreeing to lower the age of consent to 14, and to 10 in some circumstances. The NCCL was also officially linked to the Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned for rights for pedophiles.
(2) Invites Trump to Experience “Peaceful” British Multiculturalism
Paul Flynn, Labour MP, Newport West
Specifically, Mr. Flynn said that he would be delighted if Trump could show him where the no-go areas for police are, and that he”d like to take Trump down to Brixton to “show him the rich mixture of races and creeds that are living happily together there.”
Mr. Flynn clearly hasn't”t spoken to the police who have confirmed that these no-go areas exist, or ventured very far into the Third World slums that exist throughout the capital city. It's also quite evident that he is unaware of how increasingly multicultural London is becoming more and more violent, with violent-crime rates going up by 22% in 2015.
(3) Trump Tarnishes All Muslims With Views “Ordinary Muslims Condemn”
Tulip Siddiq, Labour and Co-Operative MP, Hampstead and Kilburn
Professional victim Tulip Siddiq claimed that Donald Trump's comments equated to him “tarnishing the entire Muslim community with the views of a small group of extremists, the views of whom ordinary Muslims condemn.”
Aside from the obvious, which is that Trump has never claimed that all Muslims share the views of terrorists and “extremists,” the myth of a “tiny minority” of Muslims promoting “extremism” has been busted again and again.
Twenty percent of British Muslims sympathize with the 7/7 bombers, 31% of young British Muslims say the 7/7 bombings were justified, 34% of Nigerian Muslims believe suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified, and only 57% of Muslims worldwide disapprove of al-Qaeda.
(4) “Trump's policy to close borders is bonkers.”
Victoria Atkins, Conservative MP, Louth and Horncastle
Currently, the United States has 41.3 million foreign-born citizens. This is quadruple the 9.6 million from 1970. There are also 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, according to Numbers USA's 2014 statistics, and those 11.3 million illegal immigrants currently make up 5.1% of the entire U.S. labor force.
Shutting the borders is bonkers, though. Victoria Atkins said so.

They say porn adopts new technologies first and PornHub [NSFW], a site that is as NSFW as it sounds, is proving that old adage true. The site – which receives 80 million visitors a day – found that its old, antiquated methods of tagging videos by hand was not sufficient.
Rather than hire someone to go through the hundreds of thousands of videos and tag them by hand, the team at PHub hired a robot.
“Ultimately, we want to provide our fans with whatever it is they have a penchant for and our new model will be able to surface more accurate results for them, which will hopefully keep them coming back for more,” said Corey Price, PHub VP. “It's all about continuously updating our platform to provide our fans with the latest in technology to make their experience on our platform as seamless as possible. The easier it is to navigate and access what they want, the happier they will be.”
The computer vision system can identify specific actors in scenes and even identifies various positions and… attributes. While it is obviously very difficult to describe the feature set for a family audience, the system can identify individual performers in real time – in the demo here it recognizes one performer even from the side – and it can also identify sex acts.
“So far we've used the model on about 500k featured videos which includes user submitted and we plan to scan the whole library in the beginning of 2018,” said Price. “Very shortly, the technology will also be used to detect various sex positions / categories and be able to properly tag them as well.”
Facial detection is nothing new, even for mobile devices, but this system goes one step further by categorizing videos and images based on various attributes. This means you'll be able to find favorites by name or characteristics, a feat that once require prodigious amounts of data entry. How well does it work?
“It's quite precise,” said Price.
Staring at a nondescript brick wall in the west of Amsterdam, a clue to the great English coaching conundrum stares you in the face. The wall is outside Dennis Bergkamp's childhood home, in a modest apartment block around the corner from a canal in Bos en Lommer. It was here that the young Bergkamp refined his technique with the kind of specifics that would not occur to most footballers. He worked his technique with such precision he would aim for a corner of a particular brick, time and again, with different pace and power and spin to see how it changed the ball's trajectory and challenged his ability to tame it.
It was fitting somehow that Bergkamp returned to this spiritual spot to talk about his philosophy. The pursuit of control in football inspires him as much today as a coach with Ajax as it did when he was on the pitch as a player trying to change games with a flawless moment. Control is so much his obsession that he is completely frank when he says he prefers the first touch that started any of his most memorable goals than the strike that finished them. Others might say that, but it is doubtful they really mean it. Bergkamp does. The glory, for him, is all about control and touch.
Can that be taught? "The basics for me is the first touch," he says, as if a perfect first touch is some kind of alchemy. "First touch in football is so important. If you talk about Mesut Özil people say he is not marked properly, he always has a lot of space but he has got that space because he can create space by his vision and his first touch. With that you create your own time."
It is quite an arresting concept, creating time with a moving ball. "Teach that to children," he says. "Do something with the ball, let it bounce, back, back, back against the wall, left, right, that's the main thing."
The business of establishing technique fascinates him. It is a subject he elaborates on in his illuminating book, Stillness and Speed. On the subject of how young players are "over-coached" nowadays, he becomes animated about getting the right balance between teaching young players, and allowing them freedom to express themselves.
"If I look at my coaches in the youth at Ajax, with all due respect they were two elderly men who would stand at the side of the pitch, shouting a few things," he says. "So in a way you create your own career, you create your own development, and that helps you later on. Whereas now there are a lot of coaches, everyone has got their badge, they all think they are Mourinho or Wenger, even with the 12- to 13-year-olds.
"They know exactly what to do, what kind of exercises they have to do with the kids, and in a way they don't have to think for themselves any more. It is all done for them. It's a problem because they don't think for themselves. If they get a new situation, they look to someone as if to say, 'What do I have to do now?' I believe that is over-coaching. It's too much. Let them have their freedom. You have to create the environment where they can be unique and not a clone."
Bergkamp is not a fan of the way youth football in England is results-orientated. "You have to win these games, so the coach is going to manage to win the game instead of developing the player. In my opinion it should be totally the opposite. Sometimes you put your strongest player on the bench just to let others shine. Or you put a right-footed player who can't do anything with his left on the left side and force him to use his left foot. Of course in that game you will probably lose because you don't use your strongest players in their strongest position, but in the end you have a player who used his left foot when he was 12 and 13 and 14, and he can use both feet when he comes into the first team. That's what we have at Ajax and I really stand behind that."
Bergkamp was in a way a reluctant coach. He found it difficult to adjust his thinking – a player used to the highest technical standards working with aspiring players who were not at his level. "I struggled a bit," he confessed. "You look at a player and think, 'Why can't you control that ball?' But you have to take a few steps back." He still enjoys demonstrating during coaching sessions, although he blushes and sounds slightly reproachful that he cannot be "explosive" any more.
"There are times not to coach," he says. "You have to be balanced to know that. The urge is to step in and show how good you are as a coach and show you know everything and you can tell them. Sometimes it is better to let them make a mistake. Sometimes they learn more from that than being told what to do."
Seeking out beauty and refinement in football still excites him. He sees it in Lionel Messi, obviously, but also picks out Özil, who is expected to be fit to face Norwich today, as a player he is particularly captivated by. Does he see some of himself in the German playmaker? "I do," says Bergkamp, with the caveat that he is not fond of comparisons. "The way he is finding his space, in his free role, and his first touch is fantastic. I really enjoy him. The main thing now is that he will bring more to Arsenal, and push them towards victories, towards trophies."
He reckons something has changed to make for "a different Arsenal" this season. "It looks fresh, sharp, a lot of good movement, it feels like – also because Mesut came – there is an awareness they can do something. Maybe that was the missing link."
While Bergkamp rules out a future in management, he has not been shy about his aim to one day be part of the coaching set up at Arsenal. English football still gets him to the core. The marriage of aesthetic and hectic is perfect in his eyes. "For me, that is beauty," he says. "I saw Arsenal against Spurs. The pace of the game was incredible. An hour later I watched a Dutch game, and there is no point. It was so slow. A lot of things are happening in English football, openings, the high pace, that is beauty too."

Wildlife rehabilitator Sabrina Luecht witnessed a young seal pup harassed by a young man on a 4WD quad bike in Hokitika. As a result, the seal pup had to be shot by DOC.
A seal pup removed from its mother and harassed by a member of the public has had to be shot.
Wildlife rehabilitator Sabrina Luecht​ rushed to Hokitika Spit about 2pm on Saturday, after tourists raised concerns about the treatment of a young fur seal pup.
Luecht said tourists witnessed a man driving at speed on a red 4WD quad bike along Hokitika beach, with a very young unweaned fur seal pup on the back of his vehicle.
ROBYN EDIE/FAIRFAX NZ A sea lion on the Waipapa Point beach, near the lighthouse. Department of Conservation was following up on three incidents in the Catlins in May where people had been disturbing sea lions.
The man proceeded to dump the seal at Hokitika Spit, before he sped off. The tourists found the young pup "lying on the ground with its flippers tucked under, which is a way to keep warm".

* Sea lion mum and pup take up residence in Kaka Point crib
* Endangered sea lions die in protective nets
The harassment offence against the New Zealand fur seal, which are endemic, declining, and protected under the Wildlife Act, was punishable with a penalty of up to $10,000.
Luecht, armed with a towel and a crate, arrived at the Spit soon after the call, to locate the distressed pup.
She was led to the animal by a "lovely" Australian family who had stood guard over the lone pup until help arrived. The pup was "very distressed".
"Its eyes kept closing over because it was so exhausted … The pup was extremely stressed and hypothermic – an animal victim that could not possibly understand what the intentions of that human were."
The rehabilitator said pups on the beach meant the mother was foraging at sea and would soon return and in that case should be left alone.
"But in this instance, we do not know where the pup was displaced from, so could not return it to where its mother might resurface."
"This animal was harassed… Because of this incident there was no choice but to remove it from site and euthanise it, meaning DOC had to shoot it."
Department of Conservation duty officer Glen Newton said the incident was being treated as an investigation and therefore could not comment further.
"We are really disappointed that a member of the public has acted in this way. It's a sad ending for a seal pup to be treated that way."
Luecht said animal harassment was becoming more frequent, with fur seals, penguins, sea lions and seagulls subject to ongoing mistreatment.
"People aren't giving them the space and respect they need," she said.
Earlier in June, DOC reportedly had to follow up on three incidents in the Catlins of people disturbing sea lions.
Cases included sea lions being chased and hit by cars, and dogs let off leashes.
"There is a real lack of respect for animals and we should be treasuring them," said Luecht.
Selfie-driven tourists were causing issues for baby seals at Ohau stream, north of Kaikoura, and in Lebanon, holidaymakers reportedly left a turtle for dead earlier in June, after they dragged it from the water for selfies.
Swiss President (for 2018) Alain Berset stands in front of the rest of the Swiss cabinet (and Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnherr, far left) in July 2018 (Keystone)
France, Britain and the United States all have four, Germany has only one. Switzerland, however, has 19 members of the “Living Former Presidents Society”. What does this record say about the country's political stability and leadership?
Very little. It's largely a trick question. Switzerland's unique rotating one-year presidency can't be compared with the head of government in any other country (the chancellor in Germany and prime minister in Britain).
Did you know, for example, that the Swiss president never pays a state visit?
The Swiss president is neither the head of state nor the head of government. The seven-person cabinet, also known as the federal council, is considered a collective head of state and government. The president might be “primus inter pares” – the first among equals – but he or she doesn't have any greater power than the rest of the cabinet.
What's more, during their year in office presidents remain head of their department. Ueli Maurer, for example, is both president and finance minister in 2019.
It's one for all and all for one: the cabinet does everything together, from taking a stance on policies to signing treaties and receiving visiting heads of state (although not all seven ministers are always present).
So what's the point in the Swiss president? What do they actually do? The tasks of the presidentexternal link include chairing cabinet meetings and undertaking special representational duties. They give speeches at New Year and on Swiss National Day, August 1, which are broadcast on television and radio (and swissinfo.ch). They also welcome the diplomatic corps – all foreign ambassadors to Switzerland – at a New Year's reception.

Waiting game
Compared with other countries, becoming president in Switzerland is relatively easy. In a nutshell, get elected to cabinet by parliament and wait your turn. This will come when all the cabinet ministers who were elected before you have served as president during your time in the cabinet, i.e. a maximum of six years.
Quirky fact: any Swiss citizen over 18 who reckons they are minister material can put themselves forward for nomination to the cabinet. Parliament can even pick someone who hasn't put themselves forward (hence regular jokey campaigns for Roger Federer to be catapulted into office), but in almost all cases parliamentarians have been chosen.
Presidential trivia Karl Schenk and Emil Welti each held the office of president a record six times. Welti was a cabinet minister for 24 years and Schenk for a record 31 years, both in the second half of the 19th century. Only twice has an elected president not taken up office: Victor Ruffy, elected president for 1870, died on December 29, 1869. Fridolin Anderwert was set to become president in 1881 but the press orchestrated a campaign against him and he committed suicide on Christmas Day 1880. A sitting president has never resigned from office, although Wilhelm Hertenstein died in office in 1888. There have been five female presidents. Ruth Dreifuss was the first woman to be elected president (in 1999). She was followed by Micheline Calmy-Rey (2007 and 2011), Doris Leuthard (2010 and 2017), Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf (2012) and Simonetta Sommaruga (2015). The youngest Swiss president was Jakob Stämpfli, who was 35 when he took office in 1856 (the first of three times). The oldest was Adolf Deucher, who was 77 when he became president for the fourth time in 1909. end of infobox
Every December, parliament elects one of the seven cabinet ministers to be president, although it's actually just a question of sticking to the order of seniority and confirming the vice-president (current veep Simonetta Sommaruga will take over from Maurer on January 1).
Swiss citizens have no say in who is elected to cabinet and, therefore, president.
But as long as parliament keeps re-electing you as a cabinet minister every four years (the odds are good: only four ministers have not been re-elected since 1848), there's no limit on how long you can stay in the cabinet or how many times you can be president (the record is six). In practice, however, few ministers nowadays serve a third term as president – the last to do so was Kurt Furgler in 1985.
So become a cabinet minister, stay out of trouble and you're basically guaranteed the presidency. Only three living ministers didn't become president: Elisabeth Kopp entered cabinet in 1984 (she was the first female minister) and resigned in 1989; Ruth Metzler entered cabinet in 1999 and wasn't re-elected in 2003; Christoph Blocher entered cabinet in 2003 and wasn't re-elected in 2007.
‘Question of perspective'
Here's a riddle: a Swiss president never pays a state visit but can still be received for a state visit. How?
As mentioned, the Swiss president is not the head of state, therefore from a Swiss point of view one should talk of a “presidential visit”. However, as the government explainsexternal link, “for the host country, the situation is somewhat different. For although no one individual is considered to be head of state in Switzerland, the president should be accorded the same standing as his or her foreign counterparts”.
“Quite reasonably,” it continues, “other countries regard these occasions when they invite or receive the Swiss president as a ‘state visit'; the term is therefore perfectly appropriate. It is up to the country issuing the invitation to decide whether it is for a working visit, an official visit or a state visit, with the full honours dictated by protocol. It is all a question of perspective.”
Post-cabinet life
And what do Swiss presidents get up to when they leave office? Finally sort out the garden? Settle some scores in their memoirs?
Three former presidents are still cabinet ministers and could become president again. Of the 16 who have stepped out of national politics, some have remained in the spotlight more than others.
Adolf Ogi left the cabinet in 2000 aged 58 and subsequently toured the world for seven years as a UN Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace.
Ruth Dreifuss stood down from the cabinet in 2002 aged 62 and has since worked at an international level against drugs. She is the founder and president of the Global Commission on Drug Policy.
Kaspar Villiger left the cabinet in 2003 aged 62. He returned to private industry, sitting on the board of Nestlé, the NZZ newspaper and Swiss Re before becoming chairman of UBS in 2009 for three years. Nowadays he writes books, such as “Democracy and Conceptual Thinking” (2015).
Micheline Calmy-Rey retired from the cabinet in 2011 aged 66. From 2012 to 2013, she was a member of the advisory council of the president of the UN General Assembly. In 2014, she published “The Switzerland I Wish For”.

Today we have a guest post from my husband, who loves to create games playing with math, science, and chess for our sons. He surprised me with a guest post highlighting one of his favorite math games, wasn't that sweet?
Starting a math lesson over breakfast can be a tricky ordeal. The kids are not yet in the mood to study or to answer questions. So this morning we came up with a variety of games to stimulate their analytic thinking.
Key ingredients:
1. Bag of small uniform objects – we use black beans or small legos
2. Melissa & Doug Numbers 1-10 Write-A-Mat
We played three different games, each with increasing level of difficulty focusing on basic math skills.
Game #1 – counting
The simplest of the tasks – I asked my five year old to place in each grid the right number of legos. This was a fun activity to get him used to the game, and to introduce the math side into the discussion. As he began to lay out the beans, he decided to make sure to place each one on top of each animal / object. That was his touch.
Game #2 – even / odd numbers
With the Legos carefully laid out on the mat, now I introduced a new concept – odd and even numbers. I asked him to see if he can find one friend for every Lego in the square. A Lego can only have one best friend, so each friendship can only include two Legos. If everyone in the square finds a friend, then the number is even, if not, it's odd. Our son had a great time doing this exercise and later ran up to the mom to tell her all about Odd and not Odd numbers.
Game #3 – split up the numbers
In this variation of the game, I asked my son to figure out the split of each number using the beans. The split would include one pair of beans (2) and the remainder. For example,
we split up number 4 into 2 and 2.
number five into 2 and 3
number 6 into 2 and 4, etc. By the time we got to 8 and 9, he started to get tired, so we wait to do those numbers the next time. In the meantime, we spent a few more minutes playing with the Legos, and, of course, clean up! Thank you for stopping by!

Few people need journalism in good times. Unless you are the victim of a specific abuse, you can cope quite happily without caring about accuracy, impartiality and holding power to account. In times of crisis, however, serious journalism is essential. The ideological forces that a crisis unleashes know it and know, too, that they must discredit reasonable scrutiny if they are to succeed.
The range and depth of the attack our troubles have produced on the BBC is extraordinary. Without consultation, the Conservatives are destroying its independence and enforcing a 20% budget cut, the equivalent of closing BBC2 and every BBC radio station.
After the election, George Osborne passed the £650m (and rising) cost of providing free television licences to the over-75s from the Treasury to the BBC. The BBC is meant to be a public service broadcaster, not a branch office of the Treasury. Yet the government is compelling it to cut services to younger viewers, including viewers living on the edge of poverty, so the BBC can fund a morally dubious benefit, which gives free licences to the elderly, however rich they may be. In return, George Osborne said he would unfreeze the licence fee and allow the BBC to raise its charges in line with inflation for the first time since 2010. It was a terrible deal. But at least it was a deal, which offered the BBC certainty about its future.
Osborne's tiny concession was too much for John Whittingdale, a Thatcherite politician, who has been associated with half the free market and anti-EU pressure groups of the past 30 years. Despite or perhaps because of his record, David Cameron put him in charge of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a pointless ministry that any government truly committed to saving public money would have abolished years ago. If Whittingdale could not harry the BBC, he'd have nothing to do all day. He therefore told the BBC's media pundit Steve Hewlett last week that there was no deal. The BBC would have to fund welfare for the elderly without a guarantee of receiving a licence fee settlement in return.
The BBC ought to walk away. It ought to stand up for its independence and appeal to the public over the heads of the politicians. If arguments were settled democratically, it would win. The BBC remains one of the most trusted institutions in Britain. The trust has been earned by providing serious, accurate news for generations, which almost everyone in Britain turns to when there is a major story. This is precisely why it is so politically isolated. In good times, many mainstream politicians would have defended the BBC. But our rolling constitutional and economic crises are, unsurprisingly, producing ideological movements that cannot bear to have their “solutions” questioned or “facts” challenged. Each possesses its own version of the Marxist theory of false consciousness. The people would see that they and they alone represented the light and the truth and the way, if only the media did not brainwash them to vote against their true interests.
The Conservative right has long been the most Marxist of all. Whittingdale has already warned the BBC about its coverage of the EU, which he must know will be far more impartial than anything that will appear in the press. The flimsiness of the evidence used against the BBC is in inverse proportion to the level of outrage it generates. In all seriousness, Conservative MPs say that BBC journalists asking business leaders if they think Britain should stay in the EU is evidence of bias. The absurdity of the accusation does not bother the Tory right. It wants to intimidate the BBC into providing slavish coverage during the referendum campaign, then blame it for brainwashing the masses if it loses.
It neither cares nor understands that small “c” conservatives will be the most shocked by the slashing of BBC services Osborne and Whittingdale are planning. No one who loves the national culture can imagine Britain would be improved by the loss or weakening of Radio 4 and Radio 3. No one who thinks Britain still has ideas that the world may benefit from hearing wants to see the BBC's foreign reporting curtailed. The difference between large “C” conservatives in Westminster and small “c” conservatives in the country is more than a change of case, it is a difference between two views of what Britain should be and who should decide what it hears and sees.
In normal circumstances, a BBC attacked by a rightwing government and press would be able to rely on “progressives” to defend it. But the SNP government in Edinburgh is more hostile to independent journalism than the Tory government in London. Say what you will about the English right, they have yet to organise Putinesque demonstrations outside broadcasters' studios after the BBC's political editor asked hard questions, as the SNP supporters did.
Nor do delegates at the Tory party or even the Ukip conference imitate SNP delegates and compare BBC reporters to Joseph Goebbels. The SNP wants to dominate Scottish culture as it dominates Scottish politics and shouting down the BBC and blaming it for its failures is as essentially a tactic for Scottish nationalists as it is for English conservatives. And soon, I suspect, for English leftists too.
I accept that some of the English left will never have the honesty to admit what Jeremy Corbyn is and where he comes from. But as he appoints ever more far leftists to his inner circle, most must now know that he represents a strain of leftwing thought that is as conspiratorial and illiberal as the Daily Mail. The far left no more believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the press than it believes in any other freedom. It will denounce all the legitimate questions the BBC asks as “smears”. Indeed, his supporters have already explained away a Panorama investigation into Corbyn's past as a rightwing propaganda stunt worthy of Fox.
There are many long-established institutions we could live without. If the Times or the Home Office were to vanish tomorrow, we would survive. For all its glaring faults, the majority of people know that a diminished BBC, like a diminished NHS, would diminish them. The majority of people don't set policy, however.
In times of crisis, the activists with simple, sweeping solutions take over. Whether they are English nationalists, who want independence from Brussels, Scottish nationalists, who want independence from London, rightwingers, who hate the public sector or leftwingers who hate liberal freedoms, they all want to see the BBC beaten into submission.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats urged the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday to review President Donald Trump's tax returns, as part of a campaign in Congress that has begun to show signs of attracting Republican support.

Defying decades of precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax returns while his tax affairs are under federal audit. Democrats and other critics contend that the documents could show whether his global business empire poses any conflicts of interest as the president moves his agenda forward on issues ranging from tax reform to foreign relations.
In a letter dated Wednesday, seven Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee urged the panel's Republican chairman, Orrin Hatch, to request the documents from the U.S. Treasury so that lawmakers can review them in a closed session and determine whether the returns can be released to the public.
Democrats in the House of Representatives said they planned to pose a similar request on Thursday to Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in a bipartisan letter signed by 140 lawmakers, including House Republicans Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Walter Jones of North Carolina.
The Democratic efforts face long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress. Three attempts in the House have met with defeat this year.
Hatch and Brady responded to the Senate request in a joint letter saying Democrats were suggesting “an abuse of the tax-writing committees' statutory authority” that would set “a dangerous precedent”.
Democrats say they hope to create a bipartisan juggernaut to require the disclosure of Trump's and future presidents' tax returns by pushing forward on multiple fronts.
On Monday, the House voted down a Democratic effort seeking the Republican president's returns, with Sanford and Jones voting “present” rather than opposing the measure.
Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told an interviewer last month she could be open to a subpoena of Trump's taxes as part of a Senate Intelligence Committee probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential elections.
On Wednesday, Politico quoted Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as saying he wanted presidential candidates to be required by law to release their tax returns beginning in 2020.
“The tax return is the lowest ethical bar that you can have for a presidential nominee or a president,” said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, top Senate Finance Democrat who introduced legislation in January requiring nominees and sitting presidents to disclose their returns.

In the days before taking office, President Trump vowed that his companies would donate any profits made from foreign government patrons at his hotels to the U.S. Treasury to avoid any questions about conflicts of interest. Almost two months into his presidency, that hasn't happened yet. The Trump Organization now says it plans to make the donation after the end of the calendar year.
The president's company has developed a policy to help identify profits from foreign government customers and donate the money, and is implementing it, spokeswoman Amanda Miller said Friday.
Miller would not provide a copy of the policy or otherwise explain how Trump hotels and similar businesses will separate profits from foreign governments' rentals of rooms and suites, conference rooms and banquet facilities, or payments for other services at its hotels, and deliver the money to the Treasury as the president and his lawyers spelled out in a nationally televised January news conference.
“The donation will be made on an annual basis after the end of each calendar year,” Miller said.

Trump and his attorneys have repeatedly stated that while they do not believe he is required to do so, he was taking the steps to put to rest any concerns about potential conflicts of interest between his leadership of the federal government and his family's vast business empire.
The Trump Organization also would not provide USA TODAY with the dollar amount of profits it has accrued from foreign governments during Trump's presidency so far. While foreign patronage at Trump properties in recent months has included the Kuwait Embassy's celebration of Kuwait National Day at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., in February, it is unknown how much business the Trump Organization has conducted from other national governments at its properties in the U.S. and abroad.
Sheri Dillon, an attorney representing Trump, said at a Jan. 11 news conference that the then president-elect had directed that profits from foreign government hotel business would be donated to the Treasury because “he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.”
“President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury,” Dillon said at the time. “This way, it is the American people who will profit.”

While Miller did not answer a request to describe how the company determines which payments come from foreign government patrons, she said in calculating profits the Trump Organization will “apply the accounting and financial reporting guidance provided for in the Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry.”
“The concept of profit is well understood in the hospitality industry, as are the pertinent accounting rules, for the Trump Organization to comply with the President's voluntary directive,” she said.
The Constitution's Emoluments Clause prohibits U.S. officials from accepting gifts or titles from foreign states without congressional approval.
While Trump's critics and some ethics experts have said any foreign government business at a Trump property potentially runs afoul of the Constitution, Trump attorneys have maintained that the Emoluments Clause does not prohibit payments in exchange for goods or services provided at fair market value.
The U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to questions for this report regarding how the donations would be processed and communications with the Trump Organization. A spokeswoman for Dillon's law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, referred questions to the Trump Organization.
In addition to announcing the plan to donate hotel profits from foreign governments, Trump in January also resigned his positions in hundreds of business entities and turned over operation of his business empire to his two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. The president placed his business holdings in a trust called the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, whose trustees are Donald Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. The trust was created with the purpose to hold assets for Trump's “exclusive benefit,” according to business records, and can revoke the authority of the trustees at any time.
Earlier this week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump would also donate his personal presidential salary to as-yet-undetermined charitable causes at the end of the year. Trump had promised to donate his $400,000 salary during the campaign.

Disney's ‘Hocus Pocus' is FINALLY getting a sequel. After years of waiting for some Hollywood fat-cat to get their fat furry faces out of their golden saucers filled with fancy feast and begin mobilizing a sequel to the 90s' greatest Bette Midler-as-a-witch vehicle (other than First Wives Club), it looks as though that Hollywood fat-cat will be none other than Tina Fey!
Den of Geek! reported this story via The Tracking Board this morning.
Fey's production company, Little Stranger, is getting behind the new film, and the mighty Fey herself will be one of the producers of Hocus Pocus 2. At this stage, it's unclear whether she plans to act in the film as well.
Believe it or not, I'm actually pretty pumped about this. Hocus Pocus came out when I was 8 years old, which was just young enough not to be embarrassed or ashamed for singing along to the scene where Bette Midler covers “I Put a Spell on You.” Even as an adult, I have to say the movie holds up. It has everything: a zombie that looks like the Cure's Robert Smith, an immortal kitty cat, Kathy Najimy being hilarious, Charles Rocket being alive, and Sarah Jessica Parker in a role that utilized her witch-like facial features. I only hope they can attach the original cast to the sequel, which is a distinct possibility with Tina Fey producing the film.
The sequel will pick up years after the original, focusing on a housewife who is related to the Sanderson sisters, who teams up with a witch hunter to save her children after they run afoul of some resurrected witches while out trick-or-treating.
Seems like a pretty solid plot. My 8-year-old self is giddy with anticipation. I love witches. #YesAllWitches
Supreme Court Won't Hear Case, But Justice Thomas Questions Constitutionality Of Asset Forfeiture
from the about-freaking-time dept
We've been writing about the sheer insanity of asset forfeiture for many, many years. If you happen to have missed it, civil asset forfeiture is the process by which the government can just take your stuff by arguing that it must have been the proceeds of criminal activity. They literally file a lawsuit against your stuff, not you. And, here's the real kicker: in most places, they never have to file any lawsuits about the actual crime, let alone get a conviction. They just get to take your stuff, say that it must have been the proceeds of a crime, and unless you go through the insanely expensive and burdensome process of demanding it back, they effectively get to walk off with your stuff. Law enforcement has literally referred to the process as going shopping. Most people who understand what's going on recognize that it's just state-sponsored theft.
I'm constantly amazed to find people who simply don't believe civil asset forfeiture could possibly work the way it does. The whole process is so crazy and so lacking in basic due process, that many people literally find it unbelievable. And while some states have moved towards requiring a criminal conviction to keep the stuff, many don't have that, and our President and Attorney General are huge fans of civil asset forfeiture -- so it's unlikely to change any time soon.
That is, unless the courts get involved. While the Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal on yet another egregious case of civil asset forfeiture, Justice Clarence Thomas issued an accompanying statement suggesting that he's having trouble understanding how civil asset forfeiture could possibly be legal in its current form. The case in question is egregious, but not all that unlike many other cases we've written about. People travelling with a large sum of cash (for a perfectly legit reason) are stripped of the cash by law enforcement who doesn't believe their reasons -- and then never files any criminal charges or anything, but just takes off with the cash:
Early in the morning on April 1, 2013, a police officer stopped James Leonard for a traffic infraction along aknown drug corridor. During a search of the vehicle, the officer found a safe in the trunk. Leonard and his passenger, Nicosa Kane, gave conflicting stories about the contents of the safe, with Leonard at one point indicating that it belonged to his mother, who is the petitioner here. The officer obtained a search warrant and discovered that the safe contained $201,100 and a bill of sale for a Pennsylvania home. The State initiated civil forfeiture proceedings against the $201,100 on the ground that it was substantially connected to criminal activity, namely, narcotics sales.
Of course, no criminal charges were ever filed against any of the individuals related to this. The government just took the money. The lower courts all sided with law enforcement, and now the case had a chance to go before the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, it passed on the case (as it does with most petitions), but Thomas is clearly troubled by all of this:
... civil forfeiture has in recent decades become widespread and highly profitable.... And because the law enforcement entity responsible for seizing the property often keeps it, these entities have strong incentives to pursue forfeiture.... This system—where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use—has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses. According to one nationally publicized report, for example, police in the town of Tenaha, Texas, regularly seized the property of out-of-town drivers passing through and collaborated with the district attorney to coerce them into signing waivers of their property rights.... In one case, local officials threatened to file unsubstantiated felony charges against a Latino driver and his girlfriend and to place their children in foster care unless they signed a waiver.... In another, they seized a black plant worker's car and all his property (including cash he planned to use for dental work), jailed him for a night, forced him to sign away his property, and then released him on the side of the road without a phone or money.... He was forced to walk to a Wal-Mart, where he borrowed a stranger's phone to call his mother, who had to rent a car to pick him up. These forfeiture operations frequently target the poor and other groups least able to defend their interests in forfeiture proceedings.... Perversely, these same groups are often the most burdened by forfeiture. They are more likely to use cash than alternative forms of payment, like credit cards, which may be less susceptible to forfeiture. And they are more likely to suffer in their daily lives while they litigate for the return of a critical item of property, such as a car or a home.
From there, Justice Thomas looks through the historic rationale that has allowed these laws to remain on the books, and finds some problems, especially concerning how differently the law is being used, and the general conflation among some of the criminal procedures and civil procedures:
The Court has justified its unique constitutional treatment of civil forfeiture largely by reference to a discrete historical practice that existed at the time of the founding.... This practice “took hold in the United States,” where the “First Congress passed laws subjecting ships and cargos involved in customs offenses to forfeiture.”... Other early statutes also provided for the forfeiture of pirate ships.... These early statutes permitted the government to proceed in rem under the fiction that the thing itself, rather than the owner, was guilty of the crime.... And, because these suits were in rem rather than in personam, they typically proceeded civilly rather than criminally.... In the absence of this historical practice, the Constitution presumably would require the Court to align its distinct doctrine governing civil forfeiture with its doctrines governing other forms of punitive state action and property deprivation... I am skeptical that this historical practice is capable of sustaining, as a constitutional matter, the contours of modern practice, for two reasons. First, historical forfeiture laws were narrower in most respects than modern ones.... Most obviously, they were limited to a few specific subject matters, such as customs and piracy. Proceeding in rem in those cases was often justified by necessity, because the party responsible for the crime was frequently located overseas and thus beyond the personal jurisdiction of United States courts.... These laws were also narrower with respect to the type of property they encompassed. For example, they typically covered only the instrumentalities of the crime (such as the vessel used to transport the goods), not the derivative proceeds of the crime (such as property purchased with money from the sale of the illegal goods).... Second, it is unclear whether courts historically permitted forfeiture actions to proceed civilly in all respects. Some of this Court's early cases suggested that forfeiture actions were in the nature of criminal proceedings... Whether forfeiture is characterized as civil or criminal carries important implications for a variety of procedural protections, including the right to a jury trial and the proper standard of proof. Indeed, as relevant in this case, there is some evidence that the government was historically required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt....
Unfortunately, for procedural reasons (the people who had their money seized didn't challenge the constitutionality at the lower courts and only did so after losing), the Supreme Court has to reject this case. However, Thomas' pretty clear message is that at least one sitting Justice is very troubled with the idea that civil asset forfeiture as practiced today in many states (and by the federal government) could possibly be considered constitutional.

Top 10 rookies through NFL Week 3
By Michael Renner • Sep 27, 2016
Through just three weeks of the season, it's pretty clear that the race for Rookie of the Year is currently between two NFC East foes. The big question now becomes whether or not Dak Prescott is going to be able to maintain his standing, given the eventual return of Tony Romo. Don't rush back too soon, though, Tony, as the Oct. 30 matchup between the Cowboys and Eagles is shaping up to be must-see TV.
After three weeks of NFL play, here's how the top of the 2016 draft class stacks up:
1. Carson Wentz, QB, Eagles
At least make it interesting, Carson! The second-overall pick simply does not want to make mistakes, which is good news for Eagles fans—and bad news for everyone else on the list. He has a grand total of one turnover-worthy throw this season, second-fewest of any quarterback in the league. Add to that the fact that his 80.4 adjusted completion percentage is the highest in the NFL, and it's easy to see why he's not only in the Rookie of the Year race, but also in contention for MVP at this point.
2. Dak Prescott, QB, Cowboys
The two rookie QBs at the top of this list are basically forcing us to rewrite everything we thought we knew about quarterback scouting. I mentioned before that Carson Wentz has the second-fewest turnover-worthy throws of any starting quarterback in the league. What I failed to note is that Dak Prescott is the only QB ahead of Wentz. Not a single one of the 115 passes that have left Prescott's hand this year have been deemed turnover-worthy. He's had his fair share of misses downfield, which keeps him behind Wentz, but the Cowboys' quarterback is playing with poise well beyond a rookie—let alone a fourth-round pick.
3. Jack Conklin, RT, Titans
As a draft prospect, Jack Conklin's pass protection was pegged as “broken”—something he'd have to work on at the NFL level. If what he's doing is wrong, though, I'm not sure he even wants to be right. Through three games, Conklin is the second-highest graded right tackle in the NFL, and has surrendered a grand total of five QB pressures.
4. Sterling Shepard, WR, Giants
The Giants' receiver continues to produce in every game this year. On 84.2 percent of the throws Eli Manning has targeted Sterling Shepard, the rookie has come down with the ball. That's the second-highest rate in the NFL. The emergence of Shepard as the No. 2 option New York was missing a year ago has been a boon for the Giants' offense.
5. Su'a Cravens, LB, Redskins
I said last week that if Su'a Cravens continues his high-level of play—even in a part-time role—that he'll continue to move up the list. The linebacker responded with a filthy game-ending interception and his highest-graded game of the season. Cravens are already establishing himself as one of the best sub-package linebackers in the league.
6. Jalen Ramsey, CB, Jaguars
The fifth-overall pick in the draft makes his first appearance on this list after a career game (so far) against the Ravens. On Sunday, he allowed a stingy 2.5 yards per target and had three defensive stops. In fact, his grade was good enough for him to crack our top-15 graded corners for the season.
7. Cody Whitehair, C, Bears
The former Kansas State left tackle has had his issues moving to center, but those begin and end with penalties. Cody Whitehair has shown no noticeable drop-off playing between two Pro-Bowlers in Josh Sitton and Kyle Long; the rookie currently owns the fourth-highest run-blocking grade of any NFL center this season.
8. DeForest Buckner, DE, 49ers
Yet another solid, if unspectacular, game for the seventh-overall pick. So far, DeForest Buckner has been able to affect far more plays than he's finished. His six pressures are all QB hurries, and he only has three run stops, but Buckner is still the highest-graded rookie defensive lineman in the league.
9. Jatavis Brown, LB, Chargers
Coming out of Akron, I had no clue what I would do with Jatavis Brown. He was too big for a safety, and too raw against the run to play linebacker. One thing I knew he could do, however, was blitz, as he tallied a ludicrous 15 sacks last year from an off-ball position. Already we've seen that prowess ring true in the NFL, as he has the highest pass-rushing grade of any off-ball linebacker. Brown is only being used in sub-packages, but the results have been electric so far.
10. Andy Janovich, FB, Broncos
The list of rookies in major roles playing above-average football ends at nine at the moment, so let's highlight our highest-graded fullback in the NFL so far. Andy Janovich made a name for himself right off the bat with a 28-yard touchdown run Week 1, but his blocking alone puts him on this list. He's keyed many big runs already this season.

Editor's note: For more on tDCS, watch Al Jazeera America's "TechKnow" at 7:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, Sept. 27. The class was the most difficult of the fall 2013 semester, and J.D. Leadam had missed all but one lecture. His grandfather's health had worsened, and he left San Jose State, where he was studying for a degree in business, to return home to Los Angeles to help out. Before he knew it, midterm exams had almost arrived. At this point, Leadam had, for a while, been playing around with transcranial direct-current stimulation, or tDCS, an experimental treatment for all sorts of health issues that, at its most basic, involves running a very weak electric current through the brain. When he first came across tDCS, Leadam was immediately intrigued but thought, “There's no way I'm gonna put electrodes on my head. It's just not going to happen.” After extensive research, though, he changed his mind. He looked into buying a device online, but there wasn't much available — just one extremely expensive machine and then a bare-bones $40 device that didn't even have a switch. So he dug around online and figured he could build one himself. He bought all the pieces he needed and put it together. He tried it a few times, but didn't notice much, so he put it aside. But now, with the test looming, he picked it back up. The professor had written a book, and Leadam knew all the information he'd be tested on was written in its pages. “But I'm an auditory learner,” he said, “so I knew it wouldn't work to just read it.” He strapped on the device, turned it on and read the chapters. “Nothing,” he thought. But when he got to the classroom and put pen to paper, he had a revelation. “I could remember concepts down to the exact paragraphs in the textbook,” Leadam said. “I actually ended up getting an A on the test. I couldn't believe it.”
A miracle treatment
The author with his DIY tDCS device. Courtesy Elijah Wolfson “We found that tDCS improved [our subjects'] vigilance performance twice as much as caffeine and the effect lasted more than twice as long,” said McKinley. “People with tDCS reported feeling more energetic, less drowsy and less fatigued.” Other military discoveries are even more intriguing. A research team led by Clark found that certain tDCS “montages” — the industry term for how the electrodes are placed — could increase learning capabilities by up to 250 percent. “The effect was huge,” said Clark. A few years later, New Scientist magazine editor Sally Adee wrote about her experience visiting with the tDCS research group at the federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), claiming that just one tDCS session turned her into a super sniper. Talking to NPR's Radiolab in 2014, Adee added that the tDCS session left her feeling like all the “little angry gnomes” that populate her head were finally shut off for hours afterward. It sounded a lot like descriptions of taking amphetamines such as Adderall, but with none of the side effects, and when the NPR show aired, it created a flurry of tDCS newcomers — myself included — seeking access to this miracle treatment. “We found that tDCS improved [our subjects'] vigilance performance twice as much as caffeine and the effect lasted more than twice as long,” said McKinley. “People with tDCS reported feeling more energetic, less drowsy and less fatigued.” Other military discoveries are even more intriguing.

Talking to NPR's Radiolab in 2014, Adee added that the tDCS session left her feeling like all the “little angry gnomes” that populate her head were finally shut off for hours afterward. It sounded a lot like descriptions of taking amphetamines such as Adderall, but with none of the side effects, and when the NPR show aired, it created a flurry of tDCS newcomers — myself included — seeking access to this miracle treatment.
Not ready for prime time
Perhaps the greatest online repository of information about tDCS is the website Reddit. There, I found a growing DIY community of enthusiasts — some 5,000 subscribers to a subreddit devoted to the treatment, ranging from hobbyists posting video demonstrations of how to put together do-it-yourself tDCS devices to entrepreneurs seeking to corner the burgeoning commercial market. A homemade tDCS device can be constructed from parts that will run you about $5 to $10 (assuming you already have a soldering iron, wire strippers and other basics). Of the commercial versions, Foc.us, marketed as a “tDCS headset for gamers,” which costs about $300, is perhaps the most polished device available. With its sleek techy design, it's clearly intended to appeal to the same early adopters jumping on, for example, Google Glass. Many of those in the DIY community are “neurohackers” seeking a cognitive leg up in the world. They tend to believe that any and all emerging technologies that might enhance psychological capabilities should be tapped, for the betterment of themselves as individuals and the human species as a whole. Neurohackers include those who simply hone their exercise and nutrition regimen for ideal brain development as well as “Grinders,” who design and implant mechanical devices into their own bodies. The tDCS community, by most accounts, falls somewhere in between. Some say these forms of neuroenhancement could fuel the sort of abuse associated with college students' use of amphetamines as study aids to gain a competitive edge over one another. But many neuroethicists disagree.
Foc.us is perhaps the most polished tDCS device available, but it has been plagued by dysfunction. Foc.us “People who make these objections forget that we have been enhancing ourselves forever,” said Neil Levy, editor of the journal Neuroethics and head of neuroethics at the Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health in Parkville, Australia. Levy pointed to the relatively recent development of language as “a massive enhancement in our powers of reasoning,” which he said you can convincingly group with brain zapping as a DIY neuroenhancement technique. But there are also safety concerns — and most tDCS researchers try to dissuade people from at-home use. Foc.us, for example, has been plagued by malfunction: small current and voltage spikes have caused a number of users to report skin burns and even loss of consciousness. Recently, ohsnapitsnathan, a user on the tDCS subreddit, published an extensive investigation into the Foc.us device. The investigation concluded that the technology does not meet general safety guidelines in a number of areas and doesn't behave as it was designed to. The Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for monitoring the safety and efficacy of commercial devices, has yet to take action to regulate tDCS sales. In an email to Al Jazeera America, an FDA spokesperson wrote, “As a matter of policy, FDA does not discuss publically potential or open investigations.” (Foc.us did not respond to requests for comment.) Given the lack of any government-approved device, I contacted J.D. Leadam, who, after tDCS helped him pass his midterm exam, built a carbon copy of his first device and put it up for sale on eBay. The device, listed at $35, sold overnight. He built a third and listed this one for $42. It sold in under an hour. Realizing he had something, Leadam tapped his network and put together an advisory board that included a 30-year FDA consultant who makes sure Leadam isn't making any actionable claims and an electrical engineer who, Leadam said, “was an expert in safety and quality-control standards, which was very high on my priority list.” They refined the product and took it off eBay, branding it “The Brain Stimulator” and creating a website, where it currently sells alongside accessories like electrodes and sponges. In November of 2013, they sold six of the devices. In February of 2014, monthly sales were still in the teens. But by the spring of 2014 “our sales skyrocketed and I couldn't make them fast enough,” Leadam said. “We had to hire employees to make them in my living room all day.”
Lab to table
But when my Brain Stimulator arrived in the mail, I got cold feet. So I decided to visit Marom Bikson's biomedical engineering lab at the City College of New York to see how tDCS is done in a lab environment. Bikson is one of the world's leading tDCS researchers. He's also the owner of Soterix Medical, which manufactures the only research-lab-grade tDCS device available, and a consultant to another technology company seeking to bring what he said is the first safe consumer-grade device to market. (The company was not ready to be publicly named as of this writing.) Within three minutes, I was sitting in an armchair, and a graduate student was strapping me in. Suddenly, I was sweating. “Don't worry,” Bikson said as he sat down across from me. “Most tDCS is at baby-aspirin level right now.” As 2 milliamps of electricity ran through my brain, my head started to tingle; the sensation was slightly uncomfortable, and part of me wanted to rip off the electrode pads, but I fought the impulse. As Bikson and I talked, I felt a sense of dissociation, as though I were watching myself interview him from slightly outside my body. When my 20 minutes were up, and the wires removed from my head, I felt like I was coming out from some spiritual experience, like a long meditation — or maybe that was just a placebo. My DIY experience, at the home of a friend who'd agreed to be another guinea pig, was decidedly lower tech — though similarly inconclusive. In Bikson's lab, we had used medical-grade single-use electrode adhesives; at my friend's home I'd rely on sponges soaked in a saline solution. With the device on, and 1 milliamps, then 1.5, running through my brain, I felt a tingle similar to the one I felt in the lab, only stronger. We'd decided to try the “accelerated learning” montage that had been developed and tested by DARPA. The best test of the device we could come up with was to play Nintendo Wii Mario Kart while brain zapping for 20 minutes — our performance seemed easily measurable (we would just play the same course, over and over) and a lot less violent. At first I was miserable, my green dinosaur avatar, Yoshi, falling off the track on every hairpin turn and barely finishing the course in 3:30. By the end, though, I was cracking 3:00. Of course, there was no control here, no way to tell whether I was simply learning a new skill, but I was cautiously optimistic. In the weeks that followed, I stuck to it, undertaking 20 minutes of tDCS four to five days a week. I decided to try to teach myself interactive web design, and whenever I'd run the current through my brain, I'd accompany it with 20 minutes on Code Academy, the teach-yourself-to-code megasite. But after a few weeks, the results I was looking for seemed elusive. I was obviously getting better at coding, but there was no way for me to know what role the electricity was playing. And it was still kind of painful. So I quit, and about two months after visiting Bikson's lab, my tDCS device is gathering dust on a shelf in my office. There's certainly a chance I gave up too soon, that I bought into the false promise of a magic bullet, when maybe tDCS is really more akin to meditation or yoga or other disciplines that provide immense mental, emotional and physical-health benefits when one fully commits to them. After all, despite their undying belief in the potential of tDCS, Bikson and others doing research in this area seem more than a little exasperated with all the hype their creations have generated.
