Bribir is a village in Šibenik-Knin County, near the town of Skradin, southern Croatia.
Geography
The village is located at the foot of the hill of Bribir, in the Ravni Kotari geographical region. It is 12 km from Skradin.
History
In the Roman period, the town (municipium) of Varvaria was created in the 1st century AD at the hill of Bribir (), which is now an archaeological site. Up until the Roman conquest, the Liburnians had inhabited the region, giving their name to the Roman province of Liburnia. Pliny the Elder mentioned Varvarini as one of 14 municipalities under the jurisdiction of Scardona (Skradin). In the Migration Period, after the fall of the Roman Empire, the region switched hands, being occupied by the Ostrogoths, Byzantines and then Croats.
In De Administrando Imperio (950s), Berber is one of the counties part of Littoral Croatia. Bribir achieved its peak in the 13th and 14th century, during the period when the members of Šubić family ruled over Croatia as the Bans of Croatia. Šubićs were called nobiles, comites or principes Breberienses (Princes of Breber, ). They built a large palace on the hill of Bribir, an ideal place to control the surrounding territory, overseeing all roads and approaches from the sea to the hinterland.
The town was settled by Orthodox population in the 16th century. It was part of the war-time Republic of Serbian Krajina (1991–1995).

The Civil Code of the Russian Federation (, frequently abbreviated 'ГК РФ') is the prime source of civil law for the Russian Federation. The Russian Civil Law system descended from Roman Law through Byzantine tradition. It was heavily influenced by German and Dutch norms in the 18th-19th centuries. Socialist-style modifications took place during the Soviet period (1922-1991) and Continental European Law influences since the 1990s.
The Civil Code of the Russian Federation came into force in four parts. The first part, which deals with general provisions (i.e. defines sources, names legal entities etc.) was enacted by the State Duma in 1994 and entered into force in 1995. The second part (dealing with the Law of obligations) entered into force in 1996. The third part (Succession law) entered into force in 2002. The document has certain basic principles: equality of all participants guaranteed by civil law, inviolability of private property, freedom of contract, free exercise of civil rights and juridical protection of civil rights.
The fourth part, dealing with intellectual property, was signed into law on December 18, 2006 and came into force on January 1, 2008. Part IV became the first truly complete codification of the legislation on intellectual property in the world.
The structure of the Civil Code
Part 1
Section I: General provisions
Section II: Ownership and other proprietary interests
Section III: The general part of the law of obligations
Part 2
Section IV: Specific types of obligations
Part 3
Section V: Succession law
Section VI: International private law
Part 4
Section VII: The right to products of intellectual activity and means of individualization
Unlike most European civil codes, Russia's Civil Code does not cover family law. Instead, family law is dealt with in a separate code.
History
Since its foundation as an independent successor state of the former Soviet Union, the Russian Federation had been engaged in a large legislative project of developing a new Civil Code. In July 1994, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree authorizing the "Establishment and Development of Private Law in Russia" program. The program called for a group of legal researchers, led by Sergei Alexeyev, to create a new civil code for the nation. Initially, Russian politicians on all sides of the political spectrum opposed the idea of a Civil Code. It took significant effort to get first part of the Code approved by the State Duma — while the Federation Council voted against the Code. However, the Federation Council took longer than allowed by the Constitution to come to its decision. This allowed Yeltsin to sign the Code into law. In other words, as Sergei Alexeyev put it, the Civil Code became law almost "by accident".

Teodora Inácia Gomes (born 13 September 1944) is a politician, feminist and women's rights activist, who is a former fighter in the struggle for Independence of Guinea-Bissau from Portuguese rule, and is Deputy Leader of African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC).
Early life
Teodora Inácia Gomes, nicknamed "Obono" by her family, was born in Empada, in the Quínara Region of southern Guinea-Bissau on 13 September 1944. One of six children, she had four brothers and one sister, Joana Gomes; her father was Inácio Pedro Gomes. Her family were Christian and she attended a Catholic school. When her father was young he emigrated to Porto, Portugal and was one of a small number of Guineans who studied outside the Portuguese colony. Her father made important connections with the Portuguese Communist Party whilst there. Gomes' mother came from an ethnic group, whose social organization was matrilineal. They both were active in the liberation movement. Gomes stresses the importance that the relationship with her father had in her political formation.
Independence movement
In 1962 Gomes joined the armed struggle and became a member of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), a movement that, among other principles, established equality between men and women, stating that "men and women enjoy the same rights in the family, at work and in public activities". In the PAIGC, Gomes worked closely with Amílcar Cabral and collaborated with him. She also worked as a medic and as a politics teacher. She also had military training and commanded a unit of 95 women. One of the women she fought alongside in 1963 was Titina Silá, whose death in 1973, during the crossing of Rio de Farim, is commemorated on 30 January each year as the National Day of Guinean Women. In August 1963, Gomes and Silá travelled to the Soviet Union to undertake a political internship.
Gomes received a scholarship in 1964 and went to study in Kiev, Ukraine. During her time in Kiev she participated in youth and women's social movements and spread the ideals and objectives of the PAIGC liberation movement and its armed struggle. In 1966 Gomes returned to Conakry, where she continued her activities as a teacher at Jardim Escola de Ratoma (Instituto Amizade); from 1969 to 1971 she was Director of the school.
Post-independence
After Guinea-Bissau won its independence in 1974, Gomes was elected as a deputy in the National People's Assembly of Guinea-Bissau representing the PAIGC. In 1976 she was elected one of four vice-presidents of the Guinean-Soviet Friendship Association.
As a politician she has defended women's rights throughout her career and was instrumental in making female genital mutilation illegal in Guinea Bissau. She has also proposed other laws, protecting the rights of former freedom fighters, laws of reproductive health, laws against trafficking minors, laws on family planning and laws prohibiting violence against women. In 2015 she was a participant at Socialist International's conference in Luanda. Gomes also works with a non-governmental organisation, which aims to raise political awareness and to increase the number of women in the various government bodies. In 2019 the organisation was particularly active, hoping for a record number of women to be selected to represent their political parties after the election; ultimately 14 women were given seats, out of 102, the same number as in the 2014 election.

The film's production costed RM4.5 million and won two of seven nominations in the 26th Malaysian Film Festival.
Plot
KL Gangster 2 tells a story of two brothers Malik (Aaron Aziz) and Jai (Adi Putra) indirectly caught in the gangsterism world after the death of their father, 10 years ago. Since their father's demise, their families lived in hardship with their mother (Ku Faridah) living in fear caused by threats from loan sharks who came to collect their father's debt. Due to financial problems and hardship, Jai turned aggressive to the point of willing to do anything for money to change his luck, meanwhile gaining the disapproval from his family.
On the other end, Malik is getting bogged down thinking about the problems they faced and coupled with the inspection results from the doctor confirming that his mother is suffering from cancer. Meanwhile, Tailong (Rosyam Nor),who himself is among the biggest gangster heads in Kuala Lumpur, was actively carrying out illegal activities. All of Tailong's actions was not favoured by the other gangsters, but they had to contend with his power. At the same time, King (Ridzuan Hashim) and his stepson, Shark (Syamsul Yusof) planned to strengthen their position by taking down Tailong and calling for help from his long-time best friend, Malik, and offering huge sums of money to him.
Malik accepted the offer in the intention of covering the medical cost for his mother and to pay his father's debt. But his activity was not consented by his mother and both the latter and his brother were driven out of their home. King became increasingly powerful with the help of Malik and his presence made Tailong feel threatened. He plans to eliminate King and Malik. A huge fight later ensued between the two groups when Tailong ambushed King and Malik at a night club. They were almost defeated by Tailong and King was incapacitated, but Malik's fighting skills proved to be a match even for Tailong. Shortly after, the police arrived and they managed to escape. At the same time, Malik spotted a tattoo on Tailong's body similar to the one the murderer of his father had. The conflict and animosity between Malek and Tailong grew from that point onwards.
When Tailong discovered that Jai and Malik were brothers, he overpowered Jai and proceeded to kidnap Zati (Sheera Iskandar) and raped her in front of Jai. Malik went home to find his mother suffering severe injuries due to being beaten by Tailong's men. He had no clue as to what his siblings are going through, and he rushed his mother to the hospital. Tailong finally called Malik to the port if he wants to save his siblings in the final showdown.
With the help of Ajib,a section head who sees Malik as his blood brother (Soffi Jikan) and his men, Malik managed to take down Tailong's men. Malik and Jai teamed up, succeeding in defeating Tailong and afterwards handed him over to Shark, who shot him dead. They then rushed to the hospital with money taken from Tailong's briefcase to pay the deposit so that their mother can undergo surgery. Although this results in their mother and sister disowning them who sees their involvement in the gang world brought upon ruin to the family, just as their late father did. In the aftermath, Jai stubbornly continues to remain in the criminal world in his quest for riches, and Malek was arrested by the police after being framed by Shark, who planted the evidence in his car. While he was being escorted to the police station, Malek prayed to God for the safety of his family while he was serving time.
At the same time, Tailong's death caused a drastic change in the gang hierarchy. Credited for taking down Tailong, Shark quickly rose to prominence and he became the gang leader in KL.
The story of Malik and Jai would later continue in the first film, KL Gangster.

In addition to his duties as crew chief for Hendrick Motorsports R&D team, McGrew filled in as crew chief for the #5 JR Motorsports team in 2008 for six Nationwide Series races. In those six races, McGrew was able to guide the #5 team to Victory Lane at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March with veteran Mark Martin.
Later in the 2008 season, McGrew once again played the crew chief role. This time it was for the young, up-and-coming driver Brad Keselowski, who made his first two career Sprint Cup Series starts in the #25 Hendrick Motorsports Chevy.
In 2009, McGrew won the NASCAR Nationwide Series season opening Camping World 300 at Daytona International Speedway as Tony Stewart's crew chief on the #80 Chevrolet. He then continued as crew chief of Brad Keselowski's cup car. In his last race working with Keselowski, he earned a seventh-place finish in the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway.
On May 28, 2009, it was announced he would replace Tony Eury Jr. as crew chief on an interim basis for Dale Earnhardt Jr. Earnhardt Jr. finished twelfth at Dover. On October 30, 2009, McGrew was selected as Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s full-time crew chief for the 2010 season. In July 2011, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Kenny Francis would replace him as crew chief for the No. 5 car, as McGrew moves to K&N East to crew chief driver Chase Elliott.

Matthias Hues (born 14 February 1959) is a German-born, naturalized American actor and martial artist. He was born in Waltrop, Germany, to Dr. Josef Hues and Maria Humperdinck Hues who still reside in Germany. Maria is the niece of Engelbert Humperdinck, composer of the opera Hansel and Gretel.
After graduating from school, Hues moved to Paris to enter hotel management. Once there, he joined a health club in Paris, which had just been bombarded with the new Jane Fonda aerobic exercise program from the United States. Hues recognized an opportunity and after returning to Germany, he opened two health clubs, flying in aerobic teachers from the USA. During this time, he became obsessed with the American way of life and subsequently sold his clubs, boarding a plane to Los Angeles.
He immediately joined Gold's Gym in Venice, California, the mecca of bodybuilding and entertainment personalities. Derek Barton, a former Hollywood stuntman and formerly one of Gold's managing directors, received a call from a producer who had just lost Jean-Claude Van Damme for his movie and needed a replacement. Barton sent Hues to test for the role, and he managed to convince the producers to give him the part despite having no prior acting experience. The movie, No Retreat, No Surrender 2 (1987), was a moderate success, and opened the door for Hues to make more films.
His most commercially successful movie to date is I Come in Peace (1990) and he has played a variety of roles in his films, from a gladiator turned private investigator in Age of Treason (1993) to an aging hit-man in Finding Interest (1994), to a bumbling idiot trying to kidnap a rich kid in Alone in the Woods (1996), to a dancing lion tamer in Big Top Pee-wee (1988). He also played a Klingon general in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991). Hues is one of the few foreign actors who have lost his accent to the extent that many people in his own country are unaware he is from Germany.

Harrington Clare Lees (17 March 187010 January 1929) was the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne from 1921 until his death.
Family
Lees are born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, United Kingdom, the eldest son of William Lees, a cotton farmer and Justice of the Peace, and his wife, Emma (daughter of William Clare). Lees married twice, firstly to Winifred May, daughter of the Revd J. M. Cranswick, and secondly to Joanna Mary, daughter of Herbert Linnell. He had no children.
Education
Lees are educated at The Leys School (a Methodist school) and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated from BA with a second class in the theological tripos in 1892, and MA in 1896.
Career
Lees are made deacon on Trinity Sunday (28 May) 1893 and ordained priest the following Trinity Sunday (20 May 1894) — both times by William Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford, at St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford. He was a curate at Reading, Berkshire, chaplain at Turin and curate at Childwall, until in 1900 he became vicar of St John's Kenilworth.
In 1907 Lees became vicar of Christ Church, Beckenham, and in 1919 vicar of Swansea. In this year he was offered the bishopric of Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, but refused it. In August 1921 he was appointed Archbishop of Melbourne; was consecrated a bishop on All Saints' Day (1 November) by Randall Davidson, Archbishop of Canterbury, at St Paul's Cathedral, London; and enthroned at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 15 February 1922.
Lees soon showed himself to be a vigorous worker and a good preacher. He was at Melbourne for less than seven years before he died, but his episcopate was marked by the undertaking of the completion of St Paul's Cathedral and by a great increase in the social work of the church; more especially in connexion with the various homes conducted by the mission of St James and St John and the Church of England free kindergartens. He visited England in 1928 and died suddenly at Bishopscourt, East Melbourne, on 10 January 1929.
Lees' portrait by John Longstaff is in the chapter house at Melbourne.
Lees never spared himself and overwork was a contributing cause of his comparatively early death from coronary vascular disease. He had bright personality and was much like by everyone, whether in an industrial parish like Swansea or as archbishop of Melbourne. At synod he was an excellent chairman, speaking little himself, but giving his rulings with decision. In the evangelistic tradition of the diocese, he belonged to no party and his ability, humanity and broad outlook, made him an excellent leader of his church.
Publications
Lees' published works include:
St Paul's Epistles to Thessalonica (1905)
The Work of Witness and the Promise of Power (1908)
The Joy of Bible Study (1909)
The King's Highway (1910)

Rev. Nicholas Noyes II (December 22, 1647 at Newbury, Massachusetts Bay Colony – December 13, 1717 at Salem, Massachusetts Bay Colony) was a colonial minister during the time of the Salem witch trials. He was the second minister, called the "Teacher", to Rev. John Higginson. During the Salem witch trials, Rev. Noyes served as the official minister of the trials.
Biography
Rev. Nicholas Noyes II was the son of Rev. Nicholas Noyes and Mary Cutting Noyes, grandson of the Rev. William Noyes, and nephew of Rev. James Noyes. He graduated at Harvard in 1667, and, after preaching thirteen years in Haddam, Connecticut, he moved in 1683 to Salem, where he was minister until his death in Salem. He spent time as the chaplain with troops in Connecticut during King Philip's War in 1675–76.
Before the execution of Sarah Good on July 19, 1692, Noyes asked her to confess. According to legend, she yelled to him: "I'm no more a witch than you are a wizard, and if you take away my life God will give you blood to drink", although this sentence does not appear in any of contemporary reports of the execution. There is also a legend that, twenty-five years later, Noyes died from choking on his own blood.
On September 22, 1692, Noyes had officiated as clergyman at the final hangings of those accused of witchcraft. It is reported that he turned toward the suspended bodies of the victims and said, "What a sad thing it is to see eight firebrands of hell hanging there."
On November 14, 1692, 17-year-old Mary Herrick accused Noyes's cousin, Sarah Noyes Hale (wife of John Hale, daughter of Deacon James Noyes, and granddaughter of Rev. William Noyes), and the ghost of executed Mary Eastey of afflicting her, but unsurprisingly Sarah Noyes Hale was never formally charged or arrested. A later commentator on the trials, Charles Upham suggests that this accusation was one that helped turn public opinion to end the prosecutions, and spurred John Hale's willingness to reconsider his support of the trials.
Some sources claim Noyes later retracted his opinions on the witch trials, and publicly confessed his error, but an entirely unflattering portrait of Noyes as an active persecutor of the accused witches in the examinations prior to their trials is presented by Frances Hill in her book, A Delusion of Satan. A 1703 petition to clear the names of the accused witches, signed by Essex County ministers, did not include Noyes' name. In 1712, the excommunications of Rebecca Nurse and Giles Corey were reversed by the Salem Church "... as a result of pressure from Samuel Nurse rather from any remorse on the part of Nicholas Noyes."
Noyes published Election Sermon (1698), and, later (1715), a poem on the death of Joseph Green, as well as some verses prefixed to Cotton Mather's Magnalia.
Upon Noyes' death in 1717, an elegy was prepared by Reverend Samuel Phillips of Andover.

An Answer from Limbo is a novel by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore, published in October 1962. It was written between November 1960 and early 1962, when Moore was living in New York.
Plot
The central character in the book is Brendan Tierney, a young Irish writer living in New York City with his American wife and their two children. Tierney is working on his first novel. For him to write full-time, his wife must work; he invites his widowed mother over from Ireland to look after the children. Conflicts arise when the mother finds that her own lifestyle, values and sense of morality are at odds with what she sees in her son and daughter-in-law's home.
Critical responses
Moore's biographer, Patricia Craig, says that literary ambition is the theme of An Answer from Limbo, "which - with great economy – draws on his New York experience to encapsulate the ruthlessnes of the writer hell-bent in securing a niche for himself, overriding every obstacle on the road to celebrity."
Robert Fulford, writing in Canada's The Globe and Mail, describes it as "a dazzlingly good story about a young novelist's angry need to write a masterpiece".
According to Denis Sampson it is "a novel about marital dissatisfaction that develops into a moral fable because the dilemmas in which these characters find themselves mirror a society in spiritual and cultural crisis".
eNotes describes An Answer from Limbo as "Moore's most disturbing as well as one of his finest novels. The book is about cultural alienation, as Mrs. Tierney finds herself uprooted from her Irish Catholic norms in the secular wasteland of North America. It is about the emotional limbo in which Jane is cast, as she realizes that her husband and children do not love her, nor she them. It is, above all, about the consequences of a dehumanizing obsession, a private ambition that ends up ruining the writer as well as those around him."
DeWitt Henry describes An Answer from Limbo as a "a minor classic" and says "All that's best in Moore is pushed to the limit here: dramatic access to manifold points of view, masterfully differentiated by style and sensibility, and in the tragic (and comic) distances between them somehow comprehensive in reference... Add also clarity and complexity of plot, strong narrative drive, the "world" of New York, and the overall sense of vital issues at stake: but most of all Moore's genius for constantly pushing decorums over the edge into "unimaginable" extremity... Moore's sense of probability has never seemed more deeply, bravely, widely knowing than our own, nor as clear-eyed, nor as fair."

Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold is a 2017 documentary film about Joan Didion and her work.
The film was released by Netflix on October 10, 2017.
Premise
In the film, director Griffin Dunne, Joan Didion's nephew, incorporates archival footage and conversations with Didion about the eras she covered in essays, novels and screenplays, as well as events in her personal life.
Synopsis
Didion narrates that she went to San Francisco in search of work, convinced that writing was not important work. She began writing at age five, when her mother gave her a journal to start writing instead of whining about her thoughts. She was born in California and spent many years living in Sacramento. Didion won a writing contest by Vogue and began working there. Her first piece was about self-respect. Its personal nature was unusual for the magazine at the time. Her first novel was Run, River, which only sold 11 copies. Didion recalls her father being severely depressed throughout her childhood, although she did not recognize it at the time.
Didion married John Gregory Dunne, another writer. They lived in New York until Didion was 28, when she realized she was no longer happy there. Then they moved to California for six months. They bought a house in Portuguese Bend, where they stayed for one year while Dunne researched for a book he was writing on the California grape strike. One day, Dunne received a phone call that there was a baby girl at the hospital who needed a home. Didion and Dunne took her home. They named the baby Quintana and performed a baptism for her under the sink at home. They moved out of the beach house after adopting Quintana. Didion liked to write pieces on rock and roll subjects. During this time, she began writing on hippiedom, a growing trend at the time. Many of her pieces were published in New York, where readers could catch a glimpse of the West Coast hippie lifestyle unfamiliar to them. In August 1969, the word of the murders of Cielo Drive shook the community. Didion interviewed Linda Kasabian as she testified about the murders.
In the mid-1960s, Didion and Dunne began to have marital problems and wrote about being on the brink of divorce. Didion wrote the novel Play It as It Lays, whose protagonist Maria is loosely based on Didion. They moved back to Malibu overlooking the ocean, and living near the beach was helpful for Didion. She wrote A Book of Common Prayer in anticipation of Quintana growing up and leaving her. She used novels to deal with her own fears.
Didion then began transitioning to writing about politics, supported by Bob Silvers, editor-in-chief of the New York Review of Books at the time. Didion wanted to investigate the brutality in El Salvador. She also wrote about the Bush-Cheney administration. Around this time, the news story of a white woman jogger raped and nearly beaten to death by Central Park shocked New York City. The incident highlighted class and racial divides and old political grievances within the city.
Dunne's work brought him and Didion back to New York City. Once, Quintana told Didion that she had been remote as a mother, which made Didion realize how little parents understand their children. In July 2003, Quintana got married. That December, Quintana was too sick to attend Christmas Eve dinner. She became very sick and was admitted to the ICU. One day, as Didion was preparing supper, Dunne slumped in his chair at home and died. Didion sent Quintana for a short trip to Malibu, where she fell and suffered brain injuries at the airport. She went into a coma and struggled to recover for two years, until she died in August 2005.
Didion described the grief of losing her husband and daughter as dislocating to both her mind and body. She wrote about her feelings of emptiness and void in losing Dunne in her book The Year of Magical Thinking. Didion was scared to move on and let go, out of fear that her memories with Dunne and Quintana would become increasingly remote as time passed.
Didion's nephew, Griffin Dunne, wanted to write a play about her life. She weighed about 75 pounds at this time, and he helped her become healthy again in preparing for the play.
Didion wrote Blue Nights about Quintana, as a way to confront her death. Didion realized she had focused on Quintana's amusing side while not fully seeing her troubled side. She felt guilty about not properly taking care of Quintana after her adoption.
During the Obama presidency, Didion was awarded a National Medal of Arts for exploring the depths of sorrow.

In May 2002, the statistical offices and services of Switzerland adopted a Charter of Swiss Public Statistics, now the Charter of Swiss Official Statistics. In this code of professional ethics they declare that official statistics are an essential public service which meets the needs of a democratic society and a modern state.

Maria del Pilar Maspons i Labrós (1841 in Barcelona – 1907 Barcelona) was a Spanish poet, novelist and writer of Catalan descent. Writing under the pseudonym Maria de Bell-lloc (sometimes spelled Bell-lloch), that she used her entire career, she is notable as one of the first Spanish women folklorists and the first woman novelist to be published in Catalan.
Biography
Maria de Bell-lloc (in English: Maria of the Beautiful Place) was a writer of the Renaissance Catalan period and was very active from her start in 1865. She was influenced by trends in this movement, which became known for romanticism of medieval characters, patriotism and traditionalism. She was also one of the first folklorist women, conducting field work to collect and transcribe Catalan legends and ethnographic narratives that she later recreated and edited.
Maria wrote about her Catalan heritage and her stories and poems were set in the themes and landscapes of the Vallès region near Barcelona, Spain. It was a place that was very dear to her as the Maspons family owned the manor house at Bigues and often visited there.
Her poetry was published in numerous magazines and Catalan periodicals during her lifetime. Between 1865 and 1882, her writing appeared in such reviews as Calendari Català (Catalan Calendar), Lo Gay Saber, La Renaxensa, La Veu de Montserrat, La Llumanera de Nova York (The New York Feather), La Veu de Catalunya and Il·lustració Catalana. She also published two collections of poems Salabrugas (1874) and Poesies (Poems, undated).
In a presentation of the book Llegendari (Book of Legends), Joan Armangué i Herrero confirmed that Maria was an essential member of the folklorist movement.
She is known for being the first author to publish a novel in contemporary Catalan literature, Vigatans i botiflers (Loyalists and Traitors, published between 1878-1879), and set during the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714). (The war was triggered by the death of the childless monarch Charles II of Spain). Her book describes the deaths of fighters for independence during the war and the loss of Catalan rights.
In May 1879, Maria published two special poems and legends in a special issue of The New York Feather dedicated to Catalan women and created by writer Dolors Monserdà.
On May 13, 1880, the Catalan Excursions Association organized a literary evening in which Maria's Montseny traditions were read. In 1885 Maria was named an honorary member of the Catalan Folklore Section of the Catalan Excursions Association. A few years later, Maria would face the final stage of her production with the publication in The Catalan Illustration of "Four Traditions" (1889) and "Four Other Traditions of the Time of the Recapture" (1894).
Maria Maspons was known to have carried out exhaustive fieldwork of Catalan folklore with her brother, the writer Francisco Maspons y Labrós (in Catalan, his name is Francesc de Sales Maspons i Labrós), and her brother-in-law Francesc Pelai Briz. Together, they set out to gather manifestations of Catalan folk literature. Francesc de Sales collected fables, children's games and traditions, Francesc Pelai concentrated on songs and riddles, and Maria de Bell-lloc gathered legends and traditions.

Cogitosus (fl. c. 650) was an Irish monk, who wrote the Vita Sanctae Brigidae.
Life
Cogitosus was a monk of Kildare, an important monastery in Ireland, who wrote the oldest extant vita of Saint Brigid, Vita Sanctae Brigidae, around 650. There is a controversy as to whether he was related to Saint Brigid. Muirchú moccu Machtheni names Cogitosus as the first Irish hagiographer.
Cogitosus writes in fairly good Latin, much better indeed than might be expected in that age, likely drawing from earlier documents which had preserved older traditions of Brigid's life. His description of the church of Kildare with its interior decorations is specially interesting for the history of early Irish art and architecture. He describes in some detail the tombs of Brigid and Conleth. There are at least two contemporary English translations of Cogitosus's Life of St Brigid: one by Connolly and Picard in 1987 and another in 1993 by Liam da Paor.

Torleiv Bolstad (25 October 1915 – 10 February 1979) was a Norwegian musician and Hardanger fiddle player. He won the Norwegian Landskappleiken (National Fiddle Contest) four times, in 1947, 1957, 1970 and 1971.
Biography
Bolstad was born in Øystre Slidre, Oppland county, Norway in 1915, and grew up in the village, where he learnt traditional Norwegian music from Ola Okshovd and Engebret Beitohaugen. He learnt many traditional tunes during his childhood and got his first fiddle at the age of ten.
He moved to Oslo in 1947 where he worked with Kjetil Løndal, and the two were regarded as the best concert fiddlers at the time. Bolstad was known for his clean style and good stroke, maintaining a good dance rhythm, and was conscious of the quality of the dancing and the dialogue between dancer and musician. He lived in Oslo until 1960 and worked there as a painter.
He moved back to Valdres in the early sixties and made a major contribution to the revival of local folk music tradition there. In 1966 he was engaged as a folk music instructor and a number of fiddling groups were established in the area. Among his pupils were his great-nephew and renowned fiddler Tore Bolstad, as well as Harald Røine, Olav Jørgen Hegge and Trygve Bolstad, who names Torleiv Bolstad as one of his most important teachers.
Bolstad gave concerts in many countries in Scandinavia and Europe and was presented the Cultural Prize of Valdres in 1969 for his internationally significant cultural contributions. In 1970 he won first awards on the Hardanger fiddle in all national competitions in Norway.
In 1971, Bolstad performed in Decorah, Iowa, United States at the Norwegian-American Folk Music Festival, which was part of the Decorah Nordic Fest (July 23–25), with a group of dancers which included his wife Kjellaug. He also gave instruction to experienced players of the Hardanger or regular violin at the same event. He then went on to play at the Folklore Village Summer Festival in Dodgevill on 3 August, a Norwegian Midsummer Celebration in Wakefield on 4 August, and in Story City on 5 August.
After Torleiv Bolstad's death in 1979, the folk music work that Torleiv had established in Valdres in the 1960s and 1970s was carried on by Trygve Bolstad, who moved back to Valdres to take over the role.
The Torleiv Bolstad Memorial Fund was established to provide grants to young folk musicians. These are awarded at the annual Jørn Hilme-stemnet folk festival. Winners have included Gudrun Helene Lunde in 2003 and Hallgrim Hansegård in 2005.

Fredrick Stephanus Watermeyer (14 April 1828 - 28 August 1864), informally known simply as "Fred" or "Frank", was a journalist, advocate and a prominent Member of the Cape Legislative Assembly.
Early life
Born in Cape Town into a very educated Cape family, he was the younger brother of the great Ben Watermeyer. He was meticulously schooled as a child so that, although he was Afrikaans speaking, he was soon described as "one of such unmistakably English education as an old Kapenaar could possibly have."
He was already the secretary of a public company when he was still a teenager, and at a similar time was working as an actuary and was a free-lance writer. A free and critical thinker, he also authored anonymous papers critical of the state and the position of his own religious denomination, Lutheranism.
Legal career
Frank Watermeyer was among the first Cape advocates to be called to the bar after a purely local examination (instead of having to go to Europe). He was a member of the Council of the South African College and, shortly before his death, was elected as Chair of Law.
One of his more famous cases was his defense of the Khoi war hero Andries Botha in 1852. This saw him confront a vindictive Colonial Government in what was essentially a political show trial.
Another massively influential case was Long v. Robert Gray, Bishop of Cape Town (1861–63). Watermeyer's victory for William Long led to the downfall of the judicial basis of the Church of English in the various colonies of the British Empire.
In his final year he was involved in representing the heterodox Dutch Reformed Church clergyman Rev. J.J. Kotze, in an appeal against his suspension from the Church. However his sickness overcame him before the case was complete.
Journalism
After his early writings, Watermeyer was an owner or editor of several newspapers of the Cape Colony. He founded and edited the anti-government Cape of Good Hope Observer in January 1849, to fight the policies of the British Colonial Office during the Convict Crisis. The newspaper was also a fierce supporter of the liberal and tolerant frontier policies of Andries Stockenström.
Other newspapers he edited were Het Volksblad, the Cape Town Mail and The South African Commercial Advertiser (in 1850-51 while Fairbairn was in London).
Cape Parliament (1858-1863)
Watermeyer had been an early supporter of the anti-government "popular party" since the 1850 Convict Crisis. This party, led by Frank Reitz, John Fairbairn, Andries Stockenström and Christoffel Brand, was involved in boycotting the British government plans for the Cape, in order to attain full representative government (i.e. an elected legislature).
He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Cape Parliament in 1858 and 1861. He was a liberal and an early supporter of responsible government (i.e. an elected executive) up until he lost his electoral seat in 1863. He was also known for being a strong supporter of the extension of higher education. He was famous as a brilliant and expressive public speaker.
Family and early death
He married Jane Agnes Fairbairn, daughter of the educator, humanitarian and MP John Fairbairn. They had six children, none of whom married.
He was known as an exceptionally dutiful and compassionate man. From the time of his marriage, Watermeyer got highly involved in the financial difficulties of his charitable father-in-law. He eventually took on all of Fairbairn's debts. Already over-worked, he became sick and died in 1864, aged only 36 and relatively poor.
With other family members he was buried at Wynberg Cemetery.

Thomas Richard Williams (5 May 1824 – 5 April 1871) was a British professional photographer and one of the pioneers of stereoscopy.
Williams's first business was in London around 1850. He is known for his celebrated stereographic daguerreotypes of the Crystal Palace. He also did portrait photography, now in the Getty Museum's archives, which he regarded as his greatest success.
Early life
Dr. Brian May, CBE, and Elena Vidal are the two most prominent researchers on TR Williams. They have published several biographies in various journals and on the web, notably on the London Stereoscopic Company website and in their 2009 book, A Village Lost and Found, which details 59 of TR Williams' stereo photographs. In fact, most of what is known today about him can be attributed to their extensive and thorough research and publications. Prior to their research, only one printed paragraph about him existed, and their book is now the source to look to for collected biographical information.
Not much is known of his early childhood or family life before he was apprenticed to Antoine Claudet, renowned photographer and inventor, in the 1840s. He was born in Blackfriars, London on 5 May 1824. Thomas Williams, his father, co-owned and operated a family coach-driving business with service from London to Reading, a company which was eventually dissolved. Other than that, and that he preferred to be called "T. R." to "Thomas," research on his early life has turned up little. It seems reasonable, however, that he may have spent good portions of his childhood in the village of Hinton Waldrist in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), which later became a favourite subject of many of his surviving photographs, and a place for which he expressed in his work and writing a great deal of fondness.
May and Vidal write: “Williams' talent soon became apparent, and he quickly worked his way through the ranks, from book-keeper and assistant in the reception room to operator. He could not have had a better teacher: Claudet was not only an excellent photographer but a very active innovator, always experimenting with new materials and techniques. Claudet realised that photography was still in its infancy, and dedicated himself to the pursuit of excellence in this new discipline:
“‘The discovery of a new art founded upon some startling facts in science, however perfect it may appear at the beginning, and little subject to improvement, rarely remains long stationary; and still more rarely can we foresee all its useful applications.' (A. Claudet, The Progress and Present State of the Daguerreotype Art, 1845)
"Claudet's interest in stereography proved to be a key element in Williams's choice of career. Binocular vision had fascinated scientists for centuries. In the 19th century, Elliot and Wheatstone studied the subject, and made the first instruments to view stereoscopic drawings as early as 1832."
Claudet's inventions and instruments, which placed two near-identical images side by side, where they could then be seen using the world's first "3-D" viewers, fascinated Williams as he learned the trade. During his apprenticeship, he learned and developed his own ideas regarding the potential of the art. Photography was relatively new itself, daguerreotype being the primary medium, with wet colloidal processes coming along later. Williams "acquired a sound technical command of all the various operations involved in the production of daguerreotypes," according to May and Vidal.
Williams' family grew quite quickly. Shortly following his marriage in 1847 to Elizabeth Gorfin, she gave birth to their first daughter, Elisabeth Mary. Their family soon expanded to include twelve children, four of whom died in infancy.
Williams left Claudet's employ in the years following his marriage, most likely due to the increasing needs of his growing family. It is speculated he worked for renowned photographer Richard Beard after leaving Claudet, but research has yet to turn up anything definitive on that point.
He had, however, established his own photography business by 1851.
Middle years and success
In 1851, Hyde Park saw The Great Exhibition in The Crystal Palace. While attending the exhibition, Williams was able to take high quality daguerreotypes of the interior of the Palace, some of which survive today. It is unknown, yet doubted, that they were ever made available to the public.
May and Vidal write, of this event: "1851... marked the coming of age of stereoscopic photography. Although many of the pioneers of photography in Britain and abroad had already produced stereoscopic images, it was [here] that the full potential of the medium became clear, as the lenticular stereoscopes manufactured in Paris by Dubosq and Soleil under the instructions of Brewster introduced a commercially viable way to promote stereoscopy, applauded by Queen Victoria herself.
Williams' first studio in Lambeth served both as business and home. Here, "Williams rapidly acquired a fine reputation as portraitist. One source describes how the vicinity of the studio was often 'blocked with a dozen carriages awaiting the visitors at Mr. Williams' studio.' His portraits were exquisitely crafted, and displayed a restrained elegance which became his hallmark."
Soon his success allowed him to open a studio separate from his home, in Regent Street in 1854. With over twenty photography studios nearby competition was keen—and included his former mentor and teacher, Claudet. "Williams, with his characteristic discretion and low-key approach, did not advertise his business or put up large signs to attract clientele. It seems, though, that the gentry beat a path to his door, and his stereoscopic portraits became highly popular."
While the mainstay of his business was his stereoscopic (3-D) portraits, he was coming into his own with an artistic vision of what photography could and would become. He became one of the first photographers on record to shoot still life and other artistic compositions. These images became popular to the point that they became "part of the birth of a new genre that was to become the stereoscopic boom of the 1850s." The Victorians loved them; sales boomed.
In the mid-1850s, Williams contracted with the London Stereoscopic Company to publish his images. The LSC published the work of many eminent stereo photographers, including William England, and was able to mass-produce his works, which helped meet growing demand for his prints. The LSC published three stereoscopic series by Williams.
His "First Series" was made up of portraits, artistic compositions and still life, many taken in his studio. May and Vidal write: “The still life studies, with their fine detail and careful composition, showed a clear influence from the 17th century Dutch painting tradition, and a profound knowledge of the iconography surrounding this genre. Photographs such as ‘The Old Larder,' ‘Mortality' and ‘Hawk and Duckling' are superb examples of the unique power of stereography, with their superb three-dimensional compositions, and wealth of detail, which, combined with an outstanding artistic sensibility, resulted in images of astonishing finesse. Another remarkable group of images in this series, entitled “The Launching of the Marlborough”, taken on 31 July 1855, was highly praised in the Victorian press, since they embodied the achievement of ‘instantaneous' photography, executed as they were from a moving boat, and managing to ‘freeze' the waves on the surface of the sea.”
The second series was "The Crystal Palace," this time at Sydenham, as the original Palace in Hyde Park had been dismantled. "The quality of Williams' original daguerreotypes from this event are such that, though they contain images of hundreds of people, individual facial features of Queen Victoria and her party are clearly discernible."
Scenes in Our Village
Williams' third and perhaps best-known series, "Scenes in Our Village," has recently been brought back into modern light by Dr. Brian May and Elena Vidal as the subject of their book, A Village Lost and Found.
This was a series of fifty-nine hand-coloured albumen prints on cards similar in shape and size to a modern postcard, containing images of village life ranging from idyllic scenes of trees and brooks to scenes of gossip or marriage proposals, children posing for portraits or sleeping, cottages, bridges, granaries and other buildings. The pairs of photographs on the card may be viewed with a stereoscope to produce a vivid and clear three-dimensional image. While viewing Williams' work, it seems one could walk right into the picture and turn the corner around the lane. On the back of most of the cards is a short descriptive verse, which is generally attributed to Williams, such as this one:
"Taking Corn Into the Granary."
From storm and rain
The garnered grain
Is housed, and come what may,
In his granary stored,
The farmer's hoard,
Lies snug till market day.
"For many years, it was thought that the village nostalgically portrayed in these photographs was a fictional creation. However, recent research revealed that all the images were taken at Hinton Waldrist, in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire) and its surroundings."
Dr. May advertised a photograph of the village church on his website, asking whether anyone knew where it was, and within 36 hours had received 6 correct answers.
The discovery that it was, in fact, a real village, and the people portrayed were not actors, but real villagers Williams must have known personally, adds layers of meaning and insight into the series. It "was clearly a very personal undertaking for Williams; the tone of the poems shows an unmistakable familiarity with the subject and deep involvement with some of the described situations."
Another curious and interesting feature of the series is that Williams frequently appears in cameo in his own photographs, in a top hat and tails, facing away from the camera.
However, despite his popularity and fame—or perhaps because of it—Williams ceased production of these types of images after this series, stating they had become “vulgarized by imitation.”
Royal photographer
In 1856, Williams' fame had grown to the point he was commissioned to photograph Princess Victoria on her sixteenth birthday, the first of a number of Royal portraits over the course of his career.
“Represented in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, [others] included the confirmation of Princess Alice (April 21, 1859), studies of Princesses Louise and Helena, and of Princess Victoria with her first son, Prince William."
After his series with the London Stereoscopic Company, he moved on to other works such as cartes de visite, stating on the reverse his status as "Photographer to the Queen."
Critical acclaim
Williams was a lifetime member of the Photographic Society from its inception, and also belonged to the North London Photographic Society, and South London Photographic Society.
He also received medals at the Paris Exposition of 1855, the London International Exhibition of 1862, and from the Photographic Society of London in 1866.
He produced a remarkably high volume of work, yet "it was said that no print ever left his establishment without his personal inspection and approval." His success allowed him to move his family to Sellers Hall, a large mansion in Barnet.
Illness and death
In the late 1860s, his health declined rapidly. He took on a partner to help ensure his business would continue, but did not escape the fatal effects: he died at home on 5 April 1871. His death certificate lists diabetes as the cause, but researchers May and Vidal theorise that the many chemicals used in early photographic processes may have contributed to the onset of his illness and early death, one month shy of his 47th birthday.
Legacy and collectibility
May and Vidal write, "Through his work, Williams is now widely recognised as pivotal in the history of stereoscopic photography, since his stereo cards were the first examples of photographic art for its own sake ever to achieve wide commercial success."
There are a number of TR Williams collectors throughout the world, and no one person (at the time of this writing) yet owns a complete collection of his known prints.

The Acree-Rosenheim reaction is a chemical test used for detecting the presence of tryptophan in proteins. A protein mixture is mixed with formaldehyde. Concentrated sulfuric acid is added to form two layers. A purple ring appears between the two layers if the test is positive for tryptophan.
The test was named after two greats in biochemistry, namely, Solomon Farley Acree (1875–1957), a distinguished American Biochemist at Johns Hopkins University and Sigmund Otto Rosenheim (1871–1955), an Anglo-German Medical Chemist at the University of Manchester.

The national federation was created in 1956 and became a FIFA affiliate in 1956. However women's football is not included in the country's FIFA coordinated Goals! project. By 2011, inside the Saudi Arabia Football Federation, there has been an effort to create women's football programs at universities. Input had been sought on how to do this from other national federations including ones from the United States, Germany, Brazil and the United Kingdom.
In February 20th 2022 the Saudi women team played and won their first ever match against Seychelles 2-0
History
Founded in 2006, King's United women football club was the first women's football club in Saudi Arabia. In 2009, they trained in Jeddah. The team was initially sponsored by Prince Alwaleed bin Talal but facing scrutiny in the face of intense media coverage, he withdrew his support in 2009. In 2012, the team trained three times a week outside the sight of men, with players wearing traditional football kit of short sleeved shirts and shorts. The team is coached by Reema Abdullah who also is the team's striker. It has 35 players who range in age from 13 to 35. Other women's teams have been created in the country in cities like Riyadh and Dammam and a tournament was held in 2008, with seven teams competing and the event being won by King's United. The first match between two female teams in the country occurred in January 2008 when the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University team beat Al-Yamamah College in a match played at Dammam's 35,000-spectator capacity Prince Mohamed bin Fahd Stadium in a shootout victory before an all-women audience. The player of the match was Al-Yamamah College's goalkeeper. In March 2009, a women's charity football match was held between a team called "University" and a team called "Barcelona" that was attended by 400 female fans and no men. The game was won 2–1 by University and earned SR81,000 ($21,598) to go towards people with disabilities in the eastern part of the kingdom.
, no data was available for the number of women's football players in the country. In 2006, there was international uproar when Saudi authorities sought to prevent women from attending a game between the Saudi Arabia national football team and the Sweden national football team. In 2008, the situation for women's football in the Middle East was said by author Gary Brecher to be up there in popularity of freedom and democracy in the region. An all-women's school sporting competition was held at Effat University in 2010. The tournament was investigated by Saudi authorities because, according to Ahmed al-Zahrani, director of the Girls Education Department in Jeddah, the country does not have "any regulations that say that it's okay for girl schools to hold sports classes or training". In 2011, women's football was seen as a way to combat a growing problem of obesity in the country.
Football is the most popular sport for Saudi women. However, there is no official football academies, clubs or school leagues. The Saudi women succeeded in creating more than 10 recreational teams across the country, most of the teams are based in the big cities: Riyadh, Jeddah and Khobar.
In December 2020, the Saudi Sports for All Federation launched the first nation-wide football league in three major cities: Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah. The champions of each city were Jeddah Eagles, Eastern Flames FC, and Challenge FC.
National team and football league
The Saudi Arabia women's national football team represents the kingdom in international football. However, the team could not exist for long time because of influence of misogynistic religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come to bear on the country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created.
In 2008, due to the influence of conservative religious leaders in the country, the creation of a FIFA recognised women's national team was banned by law.
Growing the game and having an opportunity to have a women's national team has been hindered by the systematic discrimination that all women's sport is subject to in the country. Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee head Nawaf bin Faisal is quoted as saying that the committee should "not be endorsing any female participation at the moment". In November 2011, Ahmad Eid Al-Harbi, vice president of the Player Status Committee for the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, said of the creation of a women's national team: "Saudi society is a very conservative one, even when it comes to men's clubs. No one can imagine his daughter playing in front of thousands of people wearing shorts, such as in soccer." Leaders in Saudi Arabian sport held a meeting in mid-2011 at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah where they discussed women's sport and possible participation of women as part of the Saudi Arabian national team at the Olympic Games. They were inspired by the example of seven other Arab nations having successfully created women's national football teams. During 2012 opposition to women's participation in sport softened with the national Olympic Committee and the Saudi Embassy in London announcing that women's participation at the 2012 Summer Olympics would be permitted if they were invited.
No Saudi women's national football team competed at the 2012 London Olympics, despite extensive pressure from the International Olympic Committee. Still, in 2012, the national federation was quietly arguing with the International Football Association Board not to allow women's participation if they were wearing the hijab while playing. The logic they followed was that if FIFA allowed women to wear the hijab in recognised matches, it would be much more difficult for the federation to prevent a national team from being created. There is a lot of pressure being put on the sporting community to allow national representation of women as the kingdom would likely be the only nation in the world to prohibit women from competing at the Olympics. A female football player in the country in 2012 said of the situation as it pertains to the national team: "Our generation started the game, the leagues, the structure. The next generation will have it on a silver platter. We may not get to play for a national team but we're laying the groundwork."
These issues persisted in 2016. Women were prohibited from participating in regional and national championships in football. The climate is still hostile, with Saudi clerics in 2015 saying, women participating were "steps of the devil”. Team creation and development was also hampered by the Saudi Arabia national Olympic committee lacking a section for the development of women's sport. Some obstacles for the creation of a national team were removed with women being allowed to represent the country at the Youth Olympics. Female players in the country were optimistic in October 2017 about a team being created in the near future as a result of the Vision 30 plan, which is supported by the King with the goal of increasing women's participation in all parts of Saudi culture including in sports. 2014 was also seen as a year with forward progress as women were allowed to enter stadiums in the country to watch men's football for the first time. However, women entered stadiums for the first time in January 2018. The team still did not officially exist as of June 2019.
In December 2019, Jeddah Eagles won Jeddah Women's Football League, the first women competition organized by the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. In February 2020, Saudi Arabia decided to launch a football league for women in the whole country.
Eastern Flames Football Club (EFFC) is one of the earliest football teams in Saudi Arabia. It was established in 2006 as a recreational team by Saudi Aramco employees. Since then, the team evolved from being recreational into a competitive team that participates in many leagues and tournaments inside and outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
In January 2019, EFFC participated in the first women's football tournament in the Gulf Cooperation Council in Al Ain.

The Royal Naval Supply and Transport Service, or RNSTS, was the civilian manned logistics service that supported the British Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA); being part of the MOD (Navy). It was formed in 1965 and was abolished in 1994, its role (excluding the Royal Fleet Auxiliary) being taken over by the Naval Bases and Supply Agency.
Responsibilities
The RNSTS was responsible for the maintenance, distribution and clerical oversight of all forms of stores between depot and ship. This included:
General Naval Stores
Electronic Stores (including radar, sonar, electronic warfare and communications equipment)
Armaments
Victuals
Fuel
Motor Transport
Some RNSTS personnel served at sea on RFA replenishment ships. During the Falklands War the RNSTS was responsible for supplying the task force, as well as pressing over 50 commercial ships such as the Queen Elizabeth 2 into military service (known as STUFT, or Ships Taken Up From Trade).
The head of the RNSTS was the Director General Supply and Transport (Navy), or DGST(N). On 21 October 1982, following the conclusion of the Falklands operation, Sir Frank Cooper, PUS, sent a message to DGST(N) including
"...I would like you to convey to all members of the RNSTS, including the RFA,...my sincere appreciation of their considerable efforts. I know my appreciation is shared wholeheartedly by other members of the Defence Council. Without the sterling work of the RNSTS,the successful outcome of the Falklands campaign might well have been jeopardised. The tasks that fell to them were undertaken with a vigour, dedication and willingness which deserves the highest praise. I should like formally to commend the whole of the RNSTS, including the RFA, and to send congratulations and thanks to everyone involved."
After some 30 years in being (it was formed from the separate Directorates of Stores, Victualling, Armament Supply and Movements in 1965) the RNSTS ceased to be on absorption into the Naval Bases and Supply Agency (part of the Naval Support Command) on 1 April 1994.

Espresso Tales is a novel by Alexander McCall Smith, the author of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.
The story was first published as a serial novel in The Scotsman, like its predecessor, 44 Scotland Street. The book retains the 100+ short chapters of the original.
Plot introduction
The novel continues to follow Pat Macgregor, a student who has taken a second gap year and who is unsure about her future direction, and the lives of her friends, roommates and fellow tenants at 44 Scotland Street.
Plot summary
Pat is still sharing a flat with Bruce, the good-looking egoist, although she is no longer attracted to him. She decides to go back to university and obtains a place at Edinburgh, but still works part-time in Matthew's art gallery. Her friend and neighbour Domenica, the anthropologist, tries to help Pat with her love life by making the acquaintance of a good-looking waiter, but when he takes her to a nudist picnic Pat realises he is not for her. Domenica develops an interest in pirates and makes plans to travel to the South China Sea for some field-work.
Matthew is upset when his wealthy businessman father finds a girlfriend, and misjudges her motives. He confides in Big Lou at the cafe, who has learned that her long-lost lover is returning to Scotland and hopes to resume their relationship. Far from being a gold-digger, Matthew's father's girlfriend persuades him to give Matthew £4 million. Matthew still cherishes feelings for Pat, but they are not returned.
Ramsey Dunbarton, the lawyer, writes his memoirs and reads them to his wife.
Stuart and Irene Pollock continue to hothouse their five-year-old son Bertie Pollock, whom Irene regards as a child prodigy. He yearns to go to Watson's school and play rugby, even securing a blazer and sneaking into lessons, but is sent to the Steiner School instead. He remains in psychotherapy, and his mother is impressed and attracted by the therapist, Dr Fairbairn, who is troubled by guilt. Bertie and his father have an adventure, travelling to Glasgow on the train to recover their car, which Stuart has left there accidentally. They meet a gangster, Lard O'Connor, who takes a fancy to Bertie and helps them recover their car, but Bertie soon realises that although the registration number is the same, the car is not. Stuart realises how hard life is for Bertie because of his mother's expectations, and begins to stand up for his son a little more. Irene insults Angus Lordie's dog Cyril, who bites her. She announces that she is pregnant.
Bruce loses his job after he is caught enjoying a romantic meal with his employer's wife, and is rejected by his American girlfriend. He decides to become a wine merchant and almost persuades a rich friend into partnership, but is foiled by the friend's girlfriend, to whom he is rude and dismissive. He fears that some Chateau Petrus he has bought cheaply may be bogus, but it is genuine and with the profit he makes on it at auction he moves to London and puts the flat at 44 Scotland Street up for sale.

Steve Bingham (born 4 April 1949, Solihull, Warwickshire, England) is an English bass guitarist who joined the worldwide chart topping UK band The Foundations in 1969 - replacing their former bass player - and stayed with them until their break-up in 1970.
He played on the 1972 Ennismore album by Colin Blunstone, on the 1974 Anymore for Any more album by Ronnie Lane, and the 1976 album Stars Fade (In Hotel Rooms) by Kevin Westlake. Steve also toured with Ronnie Lane and Slim Chance in "The Passing Show", which took a huge circus tent on the road with dancing girls, fire eaters, clowns and a general assortment of circus people.
In 1999, because of the popularity of the film There's Something About Mary, the renewed interest in '"Build Me Up Buttercup" and The Foundations, a version of the band reformed with Colin Young on vocals, Alan Warner on guitar, Bingham on bass, and Gary Moberley on keyboards, etc. The group stayed together for a period of time seeing a change of the lead singer with Hue Montgomery replacing Colin Young.
In recent years Bingham has been a member of Geno Washington and The Ram Jam Band as well as the "Reformed but Unrepentant" reunion edition of Slim Chance with original Slim Chance members Charlie Hart and Steve Simpson.

This includes those formed by raising the level of natural lakes, such as at Lake Tahoe. Most large reservoirs in California are owned by the federal Bureau of Reclamation and to a lesser extent the Army Corps of Engineers, many serving the Central Valley Project or State Water Project. Smaller ones are often run by county water agencies or irrigation and flood control districts.
The state has more than one thousand major reservoirs, of which the largest two hundred have a combined capacity of over . Most large reservoirs in California are located in the central and northern portions of the state, especially along the large and flood-prone rivers of the Central Valley. Eleven reservoirs have a storage capacity greater than or equal to ; all of these except one are in or on drainages that feed into the Central Valley. The largest single reservoir in California is Shasta Lake, with a full volume of more than .

A serious game or applied game is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. The "serious" adjective is generally prepended to refer to video games used by industries like defense, education, scientific exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering, and politics. Serious games are a subgenre of serious storytelling, where storytelling is applied "outside the context of entertainment, where the narration progresses as a sequence of patterns impressive in quality ... and is part of a thoughtful progress". The idea shares aspects with simulation generally, including flight simulation and medical simulation, but explicitly emphasizes the added pedagogical value of fun and competition.
History
The use of games in educational circles has been practiced since at least the twentieth century. Use of paper-based educational games became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, but waned under the Back to Basics teaching movement. (The Back to Basics teaching movement is a change in teaching style that started in the 1970s after student scores declined on standardized tests and students were alleged to be exploring too many electives. This movement wanted to focus students on reading, writing and arithmetic and intensify the curriculum.) Clark C. Abt is credited for coining the term "serious games" in the 1970s, defined as games that have an "explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose and are not intended to be played primarily for amusement." Abt also recognized that this "does not mean that serious games are not, or should not be, entertaining."
The early 2000s saw a surge in different types of educational games, especially those designed for the younger learner. Many of these games were not computer-based but took on the model of other traditional gaming systems both in the console and hand-held formats. In 1999, LeapFrog Enterprises introduced the LeapPad, which combined an interactive book with a cartridge and allowed kids to play games and interact with a paper-based book. Based on the popularity of traditional hand-held gaming systems like Nintendo's Game Boy, they also introduced their hand-held gaming system called the Leapster in 2003. This system was cartridge-based and integrated arcade–style games with educational content.
Also in the 2000s, educational games saw an expanse into sustainable development with titles such as Learning Sustainable Development in 2000 and Climate Challenge in 2006.
Other directions for serious video games beyond education began to emerge in the early 2000s, with America's Army in 2002 as an early example. The game was a first-person shooter developed by the United States Army as a recruitment tool, and later used as an early training tool for new recruits.
By 2010, serious games had evolved to incorporate actual economies like Second Life, in which users can create actual businesses that provide virtual commodities and services for Linden dollars, which are exchangeable for US currency. In 2015, Project Discovery was launched as a serious game. Project Discovery was launched as a vehicle by which geneticists and astronomers with the University of Geneva could access the cataloging efforts of the gaming public via a mini-game contained within the Eve Online massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Players acting as citizen scientists categorize and assess actual genetic samples or astronomical data. This data was then utilized and warehoused by researchers. Any data flagged as atypical was further investigated by scientists.
Applications
Health
On the one hand, the health sector includes digital games for the professional area of doctor training, e.g. to train an operation or to impart specialist knowledge, and on the other hand they address the private end user who uses them, for example, as motivation tools for a healthier lifestyle, nutrition or for rehabilitation purposes. In addition, Serious Games can be used as a training measure for patients who acquire knowledge about their clinical pictures and possible therapy options. There is also an increasing use of serious games in health education programs.
On 15 June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first video game treatment, a game for children aged 8–12 with certain types of ADHD called EndeavorRx. It can be downloaded with a prescription onto a mobile device, and is intended for use in tandem with other treatments. Patients play it for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, over a month-long treatment plan.
Scientific tool
In 2021, Heather R. Campbell, a graduate student at the University of Kentucky, published her doctoral dissertation, Towards a Holistic Risk Model For Safeguarding the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain: Capturing the Human-Induced Risk to Drug Quality. In this work, Campbell developed a virtual pharmaceutical manufacturing plant and used the flexibility of video games to develop various real-life scenarios. The scenarios were then played by humans under different motivating objectives through a series of experiments. The results allowed Campbell to gather useful information on what might be the next threat to the pharmaceutical supply chain. The results showed promise for video games' future as a scientific data collection tool and was featured in a Bloomberg Prognosis Article.
Exercise therapy
These include serious games that animate the player to sport and movement. For example, hand-eye coordination and upper body muscles can be trained using Wii Sports, regardless of age and physical disabilities, alone or with others. Even simple Jump-'n'-Run games can have an educational purpose, depending on the user. They are partly used in rehabilitation therapies to restore the user's finger mobility, reaction speed and eye-finger coordination.
Politics, culture and advertising
Persuasive games are developed for advertisers, policymakers, news organizations and cultural institutions. They are politically and socially motivated games that serve social communication. They cover areas such as politics, religion, environment, urban planning and tourism. The aim is to lead to create a demand for product due to a generated positive exposure to the product in the game or introduce new ways of thinking through experience.
Security
Serious games in the field of security are aimed at disaster control, the defense sector and recruitment. Public, private and municipal institutions, such as fire brigades, police, Federal Agency for Technical Relief (Technisches Hilfswerk - Germany THW), DRK as well as crisis centres and NGOs benefit from them. Scenarios such as natural disasters, acts of terrorism, danger prevention and emergency care are simulated. Challenges such as acting under time and pressure to succeed can thus be realistically tested with fewer resources and costs. This area formed the second focal point. An example of serious games from this sector is the Emergency game series or the possibility to explore the response of communities in a game in disaster management. Psychological effect that exist in real life-threatening situation are not realistic in a serious game but the training in a serious game and exposure to the requirements and constraints in disaster management can prepare to a better response of the teams in a real disaster management case and lead to an improved risk mitigation strategies.
Military games
Games like America's Army are training simulations that are used in the training and recruitment of soldiers. The games try to represent warfare as realistically as possible in order to familiarize users with the dangers, strategies, weapons, tactics and vehicles.
Recruitment games
This type of serious games is intended to bring the user closer to tasks that would otherwise be less in the limelight. Companies try to present and profile themselves through such games in order to attract apprentices and applicants. Future tasks will be presented and carried out in a large context, for example "TechForce", in which various technical areas are combined into an end product with the aim of winning a race.
Product creation games
The aim here is to give the user an understanding of a company's products. The user can test the products in a simulation under real conditions and convince themselves of their functionality. Technical basics, handling and security risks can be taught to the user.
Adult education
Real simulations and simulation games provide the user with the opportunity to gain experience. Actions generated from knowledge can be tested here according to the trial and error principle. Theoretical knowledge can either be acquired beforehand or imparted during the game, which can then be tested in a virtual practice. There is an educational policy interest in the professionalisation of such offers. With the research project NetEnquiry, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research supports a corresponding research project for education and training, implemented here with the focus on mobile learning. In addition, there is an increasing incorporation of serious games within university curricula which students can use to consolidate learning or enhance knowledge.
Youth education
The user is given tasks and missions that they can only solve with the knowledge that they will gradually discover during the game. The theoretical aspects of the game are always taught in small quantities at the right time to be able to solve the next task and thus test the theoretical approaches in practice.
Art games
An art game uses the medium of computer games to create interactive and multimedia art. For the first time, the term was described scientifically in 2002 to emphasize games that attach more importance to art than to game mechanics. Mostly they convince by a special aesthetics and atmosphere and use the interactivity for creativity and the thought stimulation of the player. Art created by or through computer games are also called art games.

Charles Williams Cain (born March 28, 1975) is an American columnist, political analyst, and sports commentator. He is currently the co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend on Fox News. He was the host of The Will Cain Show on ESPN Radio, which ran from January 2, 2018, to June 26, 2020. He has been a contributor for ESPN since March 2015, working with the features unit and E:60 and appearing on First Take. He has been a contributor for Blaze Media and CNN, appearing frequently on Soledad O'Brien's morning program Starting Point.
Early life and education
Cain was born and raised in Sherman, Texas, near Dallas. Attending Pepperdine University, Cain played one year on the water polo team and graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1997. On the Pepperdine water polo team, Cain was a walk-on who scored his only goal in 1996, in a game against UC Santa Barbara. Cain said of the experience in 2010, "Pepperdine water polo was extremely accommodating in its development of a walk-on such as me, and that's something positively unique about this program. I almost went to USC, and I'm sure that if I did have a water polo career there it would have been much shorter." In 2000, Cain completed his J.D. degree at the University of Texas School of Law. After law school, Cain moved to a ranch in Montana, where he worked as a ranch hand while trying to write a book.
Media career
Following the death of his father in 2001, Cain returned to the Dallas area to help care for his younger brother. While in Texas, Cain bought two community newspapers and started others before selling them to Stephens Media, publisher of the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Around 2006, Cain founded Quince Media, which published a magazine, website, and expos about quinceañeras.
Cain previously worked as a fill-in host for CNN's In the Arena, where he co-hosted the program with E. D. Hill from February 28, 2011, to August 5, 2011.
Cain began working at ESPN in 2015 as a radio personality, hosting the program Will and Kate with Kate Fagan and serving as a fill-in for other ESPN Radio anchors. He was a frequent contributor to Outside the Lines and eventually became a fill-in host and frequent guest on First Take. Cain then was named co-host of The Ryen Russillo Show but Russillo soon left the show. Cain began hosting his own show, The Will Cain Show, on ESPN Radio in 2018. The Washington Post observed about Cain's ESPN presence in 2018: "Cain's growing profile comes amid consistent charges of liberal bias at ESPN for its coverage of social and political issues in sports."
In 2020, Cain left ESPN to move to Fox News as co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend (along with Jedediah Bila and Pete Hegseth). Cain's last appearance on First Take was on June 24, 2020, and his final episode of The Will Cain Show aired two days later. His first appearance on Fox & Friends Weekend was in August 2020. On April 5, 2021, Cain launched The Will Cain Podcast, combining his commentary in news, politics, and sports.
Political commentary and controversies
Cain was one of ESPN's most conservative voices, although his ESPN show focused mostly on sports. Cain told the Washington Post in 2018, "Has being conservative helped me since I've been here? Of course. ESPN doesn't have a voice like mine." Cain had been critical of Donald Trump; in 2011, while he was at CNN, Cain wrote an op-ed that criticized Trump, Sarah Palin, and populism from a conservative perspective. On a January 2017 episode of First Take, Cain said that he did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election, which he later reiterated in a 2020 interview discussing his move from ESPN to Fox News. In January 2022, Cain criticized the first year of Joe Biden's presidency on his podcast, calling Biden "the worst president of my lifetime."
In March 2019, Cain likened Antonio Brown's contract requests during Brown's trade to the Oakland Raiders as being "like a suicide bomber" while discussing the trade on First Take; the remark prompted criticism.
In April 2019, after the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Flyers ceased using Kate Smith's recordings of "God Bless America" at games due to the deceased singer having sung songs with racist content about African Americans decades before her death, Cain's take on the situation during First Take that day caused significant controversy among First Take viewers and co-host Stephen A. Smith, claiming it was a “fool's errand” to apply “modern historical standards” to an event that happened in the 1930s and pointed out that under those standards, President Barack Obama's statues should be removed due to Obama previously being opposed to LGBT rights before running for president. The New York radio show The Breakfast Club would later give their Donkey of the Day award to Cain the next day in response.
In 2021, after Colin Powell died from complications of COVID-19, Cain questioned the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine requirements. The 84-year-old Powell was vaccinated against COVID-19 but he was also battling multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that suppresses the immune system.

The Archdeacon of Hastings is a senior ecclesiastical officer in the Church of England Diocese of Chichester. The Diocese of Chichester almost exactly covers the counties of East and West Sussex and the City of Brighton and Hove, stretching for nearly a hundred miles (160 km) along the south coast of England.
History
The two original archdeaconries of Chichester diocese, Chichester and Lewes, were created in the 12th century – at around the time when archdeacons were first appointed across England. The third archdeaconry, Hastings, was created (from that of Lewes) on 28 June 1912. The archdeaconries were then reorganised under Eric Kemp (Bishop of Chichester) on 28 June 1975: the Hastings archdeaconry was dissolved and her territory returned to Lewes archdeaconry, which was renamed "Lewes & Hastings"; and a new archdeaconry of Horsham was created.
On 12 May 2014, it was announced that the diocese is to take forward proposals to create a fourth archdeaconry (presently referred to as Brighton.) Since Lewes itself would be within the new archdeaconry, Lewes & Hastings archdeaconry would become simply Hastings archdeaconry. On 8 August 2014, the Church Times reported that the archdeaconry had been renamed.

Some archdeacons without territorial titles are recorded from the early 12th century; see Archdeacon of Chichester.

Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn al-Muqaddam (; died at Mount Arafat on 9 February 1188) was the 1st Emir of Baalbek under Ayyubid Dynasty, Although he was not from Ayyubid origin. He was a military commander first in the service of Nur ad-Din, the Zengid ruler of Syria and Iraq, later of Saladin, the Ayyubid ruler of Egypt, Syria and Iraq.
Biography
When Nur ad-Din died in 1174, Ibn al-Muqaddam emerged as the head of a powerful group of military commanders and high officials who wanted to assume power in Damascus. They could not prevent their rival the eunuch Gümüshtekin from assuming the guardianship for Nur ad-Din's 11-year-old son and heir, As-Salih Ismail al-Malik, and taking him to Aleppo. After Gümüshtekin made an alliance with Nur ad-Din's nephew Sayf al-Din Ghazi II of Mosul against him, he approached Saladin for assistance and allowed him to seize Damascus peacefully. Saladin awarded him with the grant of Baalbek. When Saladin's brother, Turan-Shah, requested Baalbek from Saladin in 1179, Saladin offered Ibn al-Muqaddam to exchange Balbeek for a larger domain, but Ibn al-Muqaddam refused. Saladin besieged Baalbek and Ibn al-Muqaddam was forced to surrender it in return for Baarin, Kafartab and smaller settlements. While on the Hajj, he was wounded in the eyes during a skirmish between Syrian and Iraqi pilgrims in the tent of the Iraqi pilgrims' leader at Mount Arafat.

Two human polls comprised the 1990 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-A football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.
Legend
AP Poll
Coaches' Poll
The Coaches' poll expanded to 25 teams in 1990, joining the AP poll which had done so in 1989. Florida, Houston, and Oklahoma were on probation by the NCAA during the 1990 season; they were therefore ineligible to receive votes in the Coaches' Poll.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Settee was sent to Europe with the Regina Rifles. While overseas he continued to compete in boxing, winning the Canadian Army overseas boxing championship in 1944. That same year he participated in Operation Overlord and was wounded in action.
After the war he won the Western Canadian welterweight and middleweight championships under the name "Tommy Deschambeault" and became a mentor to younger boxers.

Getenesh "Gete" Wami Degife (Amharic: ጌጤነሽ 'ጌጤ' ዋሚ ደግፌ born December 11, 1974 in Debre Berhan) is an Ethiopian former long-distance runner who competed in cross-country, track, and road events.
Her brother, Mulugeta Wami, is also a professional marathon runner.
Biography
Gete won gold medal at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, timing 30:24.56, which was a new African record and Championships Record. She also won the 10,000 m gold medal at the 1999 All-Africa Games that year. She is a two-time winner of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, having taken the long race title in 1996 and then the short race title in 2001.
Gete won the 2006 Berlin Marathon, finishing in front of Salina Kosgei and Monika Drybulska on September 24. She was expected to beat the world record over 15 km during the Zevenheuvelenloop in and around Nijmegen on 19 November 2006, but failed. Gete finished in second position during the race, nine seconds behind Mestewat Tufa, who finished in 47:22.
In 2007, Gete won the Berlin Marathon again. She competed in the New York Marathon thirty-five days later and she finished 23 seconds behind Paula Radcliffe. Her second-place finish gave her the World Marathon Majors Series Title, earning herself the $500,000 jackpot.
In August 2008, Gete Wami dropped out of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Marathon, after running in the lead pack for much of the race, as did her teammate Berhane Adere.
The last outing of her career came at the 2009 London Marathon, where her run of 2:26:54 hours brought her ninth place.

The cream-backed woodpecker (Campephilus leucopogon) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and far northwestern Uruguay. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.
Description
The cream-backed woodpecker is a distinctively-coloured large woodpecker growing to a length of . The male has a red hood, consisting of head, chin, neck and crest, with a small patch of black and white beneath the ear-coverts. The female has a black hood and crest, with some red on the ear-coverts, nape and throat, and with a black-bordered white streak running from the beak to the ear-coverts. The body plumage, both upper parts and underparts, are black in both sexes, with a buff or cream-coloured patch on the mantle and back, and a short black tail. The beak is long and ivory-coloured, and the legs are grey.
Distribution and habitat
The cream-backed woodpecker is native to South America. Its range extends from northern Bolivia, through western and central Paraguay, north central Argentina and northern Uruguay to southeastern Brazil. It is a resident species found below about . It is not a bird of dense forest, preferring open woodland, savannah with clumps of trees, palm groves and farmland.
Ecology
The cream-backed woodpecker feeds alone, in pairs or in family groups. Its diet mostly consists of wood-boring beetle larvae and it forages at all levels of the canopy as well as on fallen logs and tree stumps. This woodpecker produces a short, kettledrum-like roll of four to seven strikes. It also communicates with a quiet "ahem" and various soft and squeaky chattering calls.
Status
The cream-backed woodpecker is described as uncommon, but it has an extremely large range and no specific threats have been identified, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of "least concern".

Robert Gover (November 2, 1929 – January 12, 2015) was an American journalist who became a best-selling novelist at age 30. His first novel, One Hundred Dollar Misunderstanding, a satire on American racism, remains a cult classic that helped break down America's fear of four-letter words and sexually explicit scenes, as well as sensitizing Americans to sanctimonious hypocrisy. Gover worked with writers for three decades. On the Run with Dick and Jane was his ninth novel. His previous book, Time and Money, explores economic and planetary cyclical correlations. In 2015, the Eric Hoffer Prose Award was renamed the Gover Story Prize in his honor.
Early life and education
Gover grew up in an endowed orphanage. Gover's father, Dr. Bryant A. Gover, was killed in an automobile accident when Robert was 11 months old. His mother, Anna Wall Gover, was preparing to move to Minnesota where Bryant was to study brain surgery. The death of his father left his mother desperate financially, just as the great depression of the 1930s was taking hold. Consequently, she entered Robert in Girard College, endowed by Stephen Girard in 1848. Girard provided an excellent basic education from grade school through high school. When Robert was a junior in high school, the Girard swimming team won first place in the Eastern States High School Championship Invitational. Robert swam the butterfly while it was developing and was still part of the breaststroke event. This provided Robert with opportunities for a higher education on athletic scholarship. He chose the University of Pittsburgh because of its outstanding creative writing program. Robert studied fiction writing under the guidance of Dr. Peterson. In his junior year at Pitt, Robert became interested in economic history and theories and switched his major, graduating with a B.A. in Economics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1952.
Early career
Gover worked as a journalist from 1952 till 1960. His first job was sports editor of the Greenville (Pennsylvania) Record-Argus. He also worked for the Ambridge Citizen and Beaver Valley Times, and in Maryland at the Annapolis Capitol. From 1955 to 1956, he was employed by the public relations department of Babcock & Wilcox Steel Company.
One Hundred Dollar Misunderstanding
Gover's first novel, One Hundred Dollar Misunderstanding, was at first rejected by New York publishers, so his agent, American Literary Exchange, sent the manuscript to a French agent, Sergei Ouvaroff. Ouvaroff immediately placed it with a French publisher, La Table Ronde. The French version appeared in the summer of 1962 to rave reviews in Le Monde and Le Figaro, and other European publishers quickly bought publishing rights. English language rights were obtained by Neville Spearman, Ltd., London, which sold American rights to Ballantine Books, New York, which then sublet hardback rights to Grove Press. The Grove Press edition appeared in October 1962, and was glowingly reviewed in the New York Times Book Section by novelist Herbert Gold. It rose up the Times bestseller list during a citywide printers union strike that shut down newspaper publication temporarily. It is the first book of a trilogy, completed by Here Goes Kitten (1964) and J.C. Saves (1968). Bob Dylan praised the novel in a 1963 interview with Studs Terkel on radio station WFMT.
Later life and works
Gover's second novel, The Maniac Responsible, was called "a work of art" by Newsweek magazine. Eight other novels have followed, the most recent being On the Run with Dick and Jane, published by Hopewell in 2007.
In 1965, Gover started studying astrology and in a couple of years started to relate astrology to stock market investment and economics. He also became friends with Jim Morrison of The Doors, and was arrested with him in a Las Vegas night club fracas in 1968.
Both as novelist and nonfiction writer, Gover has explored themes of pseudoscience and the occult. Voodoo Contra: Contradictory Meanings of the Word, deals with African-American polytheism as a serious and very ancient religion. In Time and Money: The Economy and the Planets, Gover claims evidence for a recurring planetary pattern that has coincided with great depressions, and predicts a very difficult economy and economic changes during the second decade of the 21st Century. Gover lived most of his life in California but later moved to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

The Danish Jewish Museum (), in Copenhagen, Denmark, sits inside the Danish Royal Library's old Galley House and exhibits Danish Jewish historical artifacts and art. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, the building memorializes the story of Danish Jews who were saved from Nazi persecution by their fellow Danes in October 1943. Construction of the Museum began in March 2003 and the museum opened in June 2004.
History
At the turn of the seventeenth century, King Christian IV built Denmark's Royal Boat House, which was later renovated in 1906, during the construction of the adjacent Royal Library. In 1985, the Society for Danish Jewish History decided to establish a museum in Copenhagen dedicated to its namesake. It wasn't until the 1990s, however, that the organization met with Daniel Libeskind and the Royal Library site underwent another transformation. The renovation of the Boat House, executed by Fogh & Følner architects, began in July 2002, and construction of the Danish Jewish Museum ended in September 2003. In June 2004, the museum opened.
Concept
The Museum is the first official museum in Denmark dedicated to a minority or immigrant group. Rather than concentrate on the Holocaust, the museum's board of directors, members of The Society for Danish Jewish History, decided to present the diversity and culture of the Jewish community in Denmark, to highlight the positive and unique aspects of the Jewish story, which dates back to approximately 400 years.
Along with diversity, another theme explored in the museum is inclusiveness: the Danes including Jews in everyday society; the Jewish community opening up to the surrounding society; and consequently the museum reaching out to non-Jewish Danes and non-Jewish foreigners The museum's board had to take into consideration the level of knowledge possessed by the target audience. In particular, they had to find a balance between celebrated events, such as the Rescue of the Danish Jews in October 1943, and less familiar ones.
Design
The space's evolving function influenced Libeskind's design. The museum's layout incorporates a pedestrian walk between the new and old libraries, outdoor summer seating for a café, and intimate conversation spaces at the ground level of the entrance. The whole building is organized as a series of planes, each corresponding to a particular field of religious discourse. Together, the planes, named Exodus, Wilderness, The Giving of the Law, and The Promised Land, carve interior corridors of fractured passageways and slanted floors. These corridors comprise the museum's exhibition spaces and, as they wind, they form the letters for the Hebrew word Mitzvah, meaning “good deed.” According to the museum's website, the form of the building stands as a commentary on the artifacts and artworks it houses, paralleling how accompanying texts often illuminate different aspects of the Talmud. Libeskind describes the space as a “sort of text running within a frame made up of many other surfaces – walls, inner spaces, showcases, virtual perspectives.”
Content
Most of the items on display come from either the Royal Library's Judaica collection or are on loan from the Jewish Community in Copenhagen, Mosaiske Trossamfund.

Mindgame by Anthony Horowitz is a psychological thriller play set in a mental hospital. The play was first performed in 1999 in Colchester before transferring to the West End. It was published by Oberon Books in 2000.
Plot
Mark Styler, a writer of "true crime" stories arrives at the Fairfields experimental hospital for the criminally insane, with the hope of interviewing serial killer Easterman for a new book. He meets Dr. Farquhar, the hospital director, however things don't seem quite right. The doctor is reluctant to let Styler see Easterman, and encourages Styler to leave. Styler, however refuses with the excuse of a long car journey. In the end, he stays and Farquhar offers him dinner. His assistant Nurse Pailsey seems frightened of something, and is anxious. She tries to give a note to Styler, but Farquhar burns it in the bin. She reluctantly makes a pot of tea and liver sandwiches for Styler. After she leaves, the two discuss the book further, but Styler's real feelings about Easterman are revealed. He is desperate to see Easterman, and suggests that he wore a strait-jacket to keep him from damaging anything. Farquhar, seemingly annoyed at this, retrieves a strait jacket from a closet and offers to put it on Styler to show what it is like, and he reluctantly agrees. Once Styler is strapped in, Farquhar taunts him about being mad, and threatens him with a scalpel, then Nurse Paisley returns, and she knocks Farquhar unconscious with a wine bottle. She explains that Farquhar is in fact Easterman, who killed most of the staff during a "psychiatric drama" session. Nurse Paisley is in fact Doctor Carol Ennis. She cannot undo the strait jacket straps, and as she bends down to get the scalpel from Easterman, he awakens and grabs her, then stabs her behind a curtain. When Easterman and Styler begin to talk, it turns out the two men used to be neighbours, and Styler admired Easterman, perhaps even loved him. It appears Styler's motives for visiting are not as they appeared to be. Doctor Ennis suddenly awakens, and cries out for help; Easterman straps her to a chair and after removing the jacket, asks Styler to kill her. Styler is tricked into thinking he is Easterman, and they think up various methods, but in the end Styler suffocates her with a carrier bag. Once it is done, he feels guilt but Ennis awakes and now assumes the role of Doctor Farquhar. She and Farquhar, who is now Carol, completely change, and Styler is told he is Easterman and Styler was just his assumed name. He tries to prove them wrong, however his BMW is gone, and the letter he sent to Farquhar is blank. In the end, Styler is forced to believe he is Easterman, however it is never explicitly revealed to the audience who is actually who.
Performances
Mindgame premiered at the Mercury Theatre, Colchester on 2 September 1999, before transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre in London's West End in 2000. That production was directed by Richard Baron. On 9 November 2008, the play premiered Off Broadway in New York City starring Keith Carradine as Dr. Farquhar and directed by Ken Russell, who made his New York City directorial debut with the production. The production closed on 28 December 2008. Another run of performances took place at the Ambassadors Theatre in London in 2018, following a UK tour.

The Karthala white-eye (Zosterops mouroniensis), also known as the Mount Karthala white-eye, Grand Comore white-eye, or Comoro white-eye, is a species of bird in the family Zosteropidae. As suggested by its name, it is endemic to Philippia heath woodland growing on Mount Karthala on the island of Grand Comore in the Comoros. Mount Karthala is an active volcano and future eruptions pose a serious threat to the Karthala white-eye. The bird is further threatened by human-induced habitat loss.
The bird is approximately 13 cm long with olive upperparts and yellow-green underparts. It has a white ring around the eye. Its diet consists of fruits and insects.

The Third Battle of Petrozsény was a World War I military engagement between Romanian forces on one side and Central Powers forces (Austria-Hungary and Germany) on the other side. It was part of the wider Battle of Transylvania and the last engagement in the area around Petrozsény. The battle resulted in a Central Powers victory.
Background
Romania declared war on the Central Powers on 27 August 1916, and proceeded to invade the region of Transylvania. On 29 August, the Romanian I Corps of the 1st Army (General Ioan Culcer) defeated the Hungarian coal miner battalions defending the vital Transylvanian coal mining center at Petrozsény (Petroșani), inflicting heavy losses, and occupied the town. Given that this was a region of valuable coal mines which were vital for the Hungarian railways, this was the area where the first Central Powers counterattack against the Romanian invasion of Transylvania was launched. Taking place on 8 September, it was also the first military engagement during the Battle of Transylvania to involve German forces, three days after the first German unit to arrive in Transylvania unloaded at Marosillye (Ilia) on 5 September. Despite German support, the Austro-Hungarian commander of the 144th Infantry Brigade, Colonel Ludwig Berger, "inexplicably" ordered a retreat. Thus, the Romanians had little difficulty repulsing the first Central Powers counterattack against their invasion of Transylvania.
German General Hermann von Staabs, the commander of the XXXIX Corps which had assumed responsibility on 8 September for operations in the southern region of Transylvania, reacted quickly to the Austrian withdrawal. Aside from the Austro-Hungarian 144th Infantry Brigade and the German 187th Regiment of the German 187th Infantry Division (the first German unit to enter Transylvania), von Staabs also sent to Puj the 189th Regiment, the artillery belonging to the 187th Division, as well as the Bavarian light infantry regiment of the Alpenkorps (the first unit of the Alpenkorps to arrive in Transylvania). This force, commanded by Major General Edwin Sunkel (the commander of the German 187th Infantry Division), began its advance on 14 September. Meantime the Romanian forces in the area were severely reduced. At the beginning of September, the Romanian units in the area comprised the bulk of General Culcer's 1st Army: the 2nd, 11th and 12th Divisions. However, following the Romanian defeat in the Dobruja, the 2nd and 12th divisions were transferred to the south. The transfer of Culcer's two divisions started before 9 September. On the 9th, Major Radu R. Rosetti from the Romanian headquarters stated to General Andrei Zayonchkovski - the Russian commander in Dobruja - that the 2nd and 12th Divisions "were coming from Transylvania". The remaining 11th Division in the Petrozsény sector was commanded by General Ioan Muică. Culcer also involved himself more directly in local operations by sending the command of the I Corps - the group of Romanian 1st Army divisions operating in Transylvania - to Nagytalmács (Tălmaciu/Talmesch), to direct the operations of the two divisions located there. Initially, the I Corps directed operations in both the area around Petrozsény (Jiu Valley) and the area around Nagytalmács (Olt Valley). General Ioan Popovici, commander of the I Corps, arrived in Nagytalmács along with his staff on 16 September.
The three divisions of the German 9th Army concentrating at Szászsebes (Sebeș/Mühlbach) could be enveloped by the Romanians from the region of the two mountain passes, and - according to German planning - this was the possibility to be dealt with first. The German-led Central Powers force disposed of an exceedingly strong concentration of howitzers and mountain guns, amounting to an overwhelming superiority in artillery. The task of throwing back the Romanian forces in the area over the frontier was accomplished between 14 and 22 September (Battle of Nagybár and First Battle of Petrozsény). On 21 September, a Berlin dispatch announced that the Vulcan Pass was taken by German forces. However, on the following day, the Romanians were still fighting at this point. On 22 September, the two German battalions remaining in the area stormed the Vulcan Pass. The remainder of the German forces were shifted to another sector of the Transylvanian front. This shifting of forces began during the night of 22-23 September, as the Germans appeared to have imagined that they had finished off their opponents. The Central Powers force left behind to mask the Vulcan and Szurdok passes thus remained mostly Austro-Hungarian, consisting of the 144th Brigade reinforced by two German battalions and two batteries. However, sympathetic ethnic-Romanians living in the region immediately made General Culcer's headquarters aware that the bulk of the Germans had pulled out of the area. The Romanian general promptly took advantage of this development, launching his counterattack on 25 September. Culcer personally directed operations. The Central Powers were driven back to Merisor.
German General Erich von Falkenhayn sent the newly-formed 301st Division to take charge at Petrozsény. This division had no units other than a headquarters staff, its function being to provide an additional control element. The 301st Division was commanded by General Johannes von Busse. Von Busse arrived in the Petrozsény Basin on 28 September and managed to assemble the five battalions of the Austro-Hungarian 2nd Mountain Brigade much faster than anyone thought possible. Both the 2nd Mountain Brigade and the 144th Infantry Brigade were placed under the command of the German 301st Division. The Romanian command was likewise altered. On 19 September, Brigadier-General Ioan Muică's 11th Division abandoned the Szurdok Pass, retreating to Bumbești, back across the border. Apparently, this action was not part of the plan of Muică's superior, General Ioan Culcer. This is evidenced by the fact that, during the 11th Division's successful counterattack launched on 25 September, it was Culcer himself who directed operations. The relieved Muică was ultimately replaced by General Dumitru Cocorăscu.
Battle
Much to Falkenhayn's relief, von Busse's forces attacked west of Petrozsény on 30 September. On 1 October, the Romanian forces held a line extending from west of Mount Tulișa to Mount Oboroca - running north of Hobicaurikány (Uricani) and Kimpulunyág (Câmpu lui Neag), Lupény (Lupeni) and Zsilyvajdejvulkán (Vulcan) - then continuing northeast through Petrozsény and Petrilla (Petrila). The Austro-Hungarian 144th Brigade fought at Petrilla at the beginning of October. On 1 October, the Germans reached Petrozsény. The fighting for Petrozsény itself took place between 1 and 3 October. The official Austro-Hungarian communique of 2 October announced the seizure of Mount Oboroca. However, it was only on 3 October that a Romanian communique acknowledged the loss of Mount Oboroca to Austro-Hungarian troops. The Romanian communique appears to be the correct one, given that post-war Austrian sources state that the fighting for Oboroca took place on 3 October. The Austro-Hungarian unit involved was the 2nd Mountain Brigade. The Romanian communique of 4 October announced the Romanian withdrawal from the region, but not before destroying Petrozsény's coal mines. The battle ended on 5 October, with both Petrozsény and the Szurdok Pass being recaptured by the Central Powers.
Aftermath
Before being finally left in the hands of the Austro-Hungarians, Petrozsény was reduced to rubble. The Romanians succeeded in destroying the town's vital coal mines before retreating. On 23 October, the Central Powers launched the First Battle of the Jiu Valley.

Tomasina Morosini (c. 1250 in Venice – 1300 in Óbuda), Duchess of Slavonia, was a member of the prominent Venetian Morosini family. Her son was Andrew III, the Venetian King of Hungary.
Life
She was the daughter of Michele Sbarra Morosini, Patrician of Venice. Her brother was Albertino Morosini.
In 1263 she married Stephen the Posthumous, Prince of Hungary in Venice where he was living in exile. His paternity was disputed by his brothers born from their father's earlier marriage and he was not recognized as heir presumptive to the Hungarian throne. Tomasina gave birth to a son, Andrew III, King of Hungary (ruled 1290-1301), who was named after his grandfather, Andrew II.
She supported her son's claim to the Hungarian throne. After the death of King Ladislaus IV, Prince Andrew succeeded to gain the kingdom and he was crowned King of Hungary in the name of Andrew III in 1290. He summoned his mother to Hungary and appointed her Princess of Slavonia.
Allegedly she was poisoned in 1300, shortly before her son's death on 14 January 1301 which was also rumoured to have been caused by poisoning. He was the last king of the House of Árpád.

Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning (also known as 'CT' planning - see below) is an approach to managing the growth of metropolises. It is a type of regional planning, as it deals with issues beyond strict city limits. It was first applied to the Madrid Metropolitan Plan in 1996 and has since been applied to a number of other metropolises.
Reticular Matrix Planning methodology
The methodology has two principal components: linearity and scale.
Linear-based metropolises
Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning detected that, counter to Walter Christaller's Central Place Theory, metropolises and urban systems do not exist in ‘featureless plains'. This notion is the precondition to the application of Christaller's theory. To the contrary, Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning analyzes that most metropolises develop in a particular geographical site, a strategic location for economic and social relations. A strategic location is one that has a comparative advantage mostly related to a point of transition between two geographical systems: the comparative advantage at the border between two ecosystems.
Strategic locations are places like seaports, river crossings, mountain passages or foothills. Often each ecosystem requires a different mode of transportation. The geographical comparative advantage that requires a logistic intermodal node has been the economic and social base on which metropolises grow.
Geographical features are most commonly linear: a coast, river, ridge, etc. Metropolises are thus naturally determined by a linear direction inconsistent with the circular or hexagonal approach taken by Christaller's theories and most common historical urban planning.
The proper response to linearity is the development of a gradient approach: parallel lines to the main linear feature produce a transversal force gradient. The reticula vertebrates the system in a natural way and responds to the location needs better than the hexagonal or orbital systems.
Metropolitan scales
As an aggregation of urban units, the metropolis has a different scale. The integration of the urban and metropolitan scales is the focus of most metropolitan planning conflicts. A scale dialogue has to be articulated. It builds beyond the urban (1:5,000) and metropolitan (1:50,000) scales upwards to the national (1:500,000) and continental (1:5,000,000), as well as downwards to the urban design (1:500) and architecture (1:50) scales.
'Chess on a Tripod'
Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning has been described as the ‘Chess on a Tripod' (CT) Method. The Method consists of two principles:
Chess: (Also called Chessboard Planning) The Grey infrastructure (transportation) reticula form the basic chessboard pattern. Every municipality located in the core of this cellular structure plays a different role in the metropolitan system. The role played, decided in dialogue between the municipality and the regional-metropolitan authority, can be visualized as the role of the pieces in the Chess Game.
King (Central Historic district)
Queen (Main Productive Infrastructure: port/airport)
Towers (Main secondary metropolitan centers)
Bishops (Industrial and entrepreneurial productive fabric)
Horses (Territorial Sub-centers)
Pawns (Residential municipalities).
As in Chess, the location of these figures (which represent metropolitan functions) determines the results of the 'game,' i.e. control of the territory and the capacity to build up an economically efficient, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable metropolis.
Tripod: The development of a metropolis is based on a three-legged system: economy, sociology and environment. The three legs are under the control of the governance system, which is what unites the policy making of the three realms. The stool represents the government and the three legs constitute the tripod.
The objective of economic policies is to achieve efficiency. The objective of social policies is to achieve equity. The objective of environmental policies is to achieve sustainability (often involving implementing Green infrastructure. The objective of institutional governance is to achieve equilibrium (‘Ethical Equilibrium') among the three areas.
It is upon this tripod mechanism that metropolitan planning must evolve its spatial integrative policies to maintain the efficiency, equity, sustainability and equilibrium in the 5 subsystems (Environment, Transport, Housing, Productive Activities and Social Facilities) that constitute the metropolitan system.
Mechanisms
The mechanisms of the CT planning method require dialogue beyond that among the 3 legs of the stool, the Fabric and Form, and the 5 sub-systems. There are other realms of metropolitan decision making dialogues included in the method:
Long: The CT method suggests that metropolitan planning deal with long term strategic issues (20 or even 40 year horizons, rather than the 12 year horizons of urban planning).
Wide: The CT Method suggests that metropolitan planning does not just deal with the physical layout approach of most of urban planning. It has to incorporate economics, sociology and governance to deal with the complexity of the future evolution of the Metropolis and effectively contribute to its development.
Indicative: The method is an indicative approach to consensus building rather than a compulsory method. As such, it is more based in social capital continuous policy making and consensus building versus formal administrative blueprint planning. Because many layers of government (and other stakeholders) are involved in metropolitan planning, decision making is so dispersed that no government layer can impose through a compulsory plan the policies to be implemented by the other autonomous and independent authorities.
Synchronic consensus: Under the indicative umbrella, two types of consensus have to be achieved. The consensus among the existing authorities of different rank and level has to be achieved to put forward consistent policies among those authorities. This ‘just in time' consensus is called ‘Synchronic Consensus.' It is the actual consensus among the stakeholders and authorities involved in the development process.
Diachronic consensus: The long term vision of metropolitan planning requires not only an immediate consensus with the responsible authorities and stakeholders, but also a long-term consensus with future authorities (as far as 20–40 years away). This is called ‘Diachronic consensus.' As it is impossible to know in a democratic system who those authorities will be, the way to achieve this consensus is both by having a permanent dialogue with the existing representatives of the political parties which are most likely to form those future governments and to have a system of planning that will allow for adaptation as those successive governments come to place. Flexibility and adaptability, represented in the Variable Geometry and Sliding Horizon mechanisms (below) are a way of proving to future governments that there is no intention of imposing a metropolitan plan upon them and that the plan is prepared for the dialogue of receiving their adaptations and revisions.
Variable Geometry: In the CT Method, the average plan spans 24 years. When forecasting is done for such a long period the variables are so uncertain that any specific extrapolation is likely to be inaccurate. The response is to have a flexible approach to the conclusions resulting from those extrapolations both to be able to respond to the needs forecasted but also to adapt if there are major variations or shift in tendencies.
Sliding Horizon: Taking the average plan (24 years) as an example, another consideration arises. Every new Government has the possibility to revise it (Diachronic Consensus) and adapt it (Variable Geometry). As it does (say, every 4 years) the scope of the plan and its final horizon shortens. In the final phase, when the plan is revised for the last time, 20 years after continuous implementation and 4 years before the end, the scope would only be 4 years. The long term horizon would be lost. In order to maintain a strategic, long-term vision necessary for adequate metropolitan planning, the Plan has to be revised/adapted every 4 years, but the horizon (24 years, in this example) should remain the constant. With every revision the horizon should be prolonged to always keep the 24 year vision. This periodical slide of the system into the future keeping the 24 year time frame every 4 years is called the ‘Sliding Horizon.'
Reticular Matrix: The geo-topographical directionality defined by the linear ecosystem border generates a reticular gradient parallel and perpendicular to that line. The cells of the reticula constitute a matrix of urban features.
Form: The roles and relations of the cells, as the way to address those relations, constitute the Form of the Metropolis (1:50,000 scale).
Fabric: The distributions of functions (either following the Balanced Urban Development model or presenting peculiarities depending on the role they play in the Form Structure) constitute the Urban Fabric (1:5,000 Scale). Through the change of scale and the formation of new relations, the new built form type, the fabric experiences a deep typological reform and is conceptually metamorphosed.
The Reticula, like a music pentagram, are the structural framework to hold the notes. The cells of the Matrix are the substantive units. They constitute the uniqueness of metropolitan space: the architecture of the metropolis.
Difference from urban planning
The elements of the CT Method (mentioned above) make it a markedly different system than the common methodologies of urban planning.
Urban Planning relates the rights and dues of the population (land ownership and its rights) to the urban structure under the responsibility of the Local Authority. Urban Planning is the dialogue between the Local Authority and the Citizens.
Metropolitan Planning is different in the fact that it does not relate a single administration with its citizens; it relates the different administrations of a complex territory among themselves to build up a common and consistent strategy for the territory under their shared responsibilities.
The CT Method argues that while urban planning relates the administration (local authority) and the administrated (citizens), Metropolitan Planning relates the various administrations among themselves. The indicative (versus compulsory) procedure, consensus building emphasis and the mechanisms (variability, adaptability, time and sectors) are different, as is reflected both in process and outcome. Addressing metropolitan mechanisms with common urban planning methods is at the origin of the failures of metropolitan planning.
Applications of the method
The CT Method has been applied within the World Bank for strategic analysis of rapidly growing metropolises, allowing for both long term development vision and short term decision making for structural projects, as is the case of NaMSIP (Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project).

Influences of the system also may be seen in the Panama Metropolitan Plan (Panama 1997) and the Strategic Plan of Colombo (Sri Lanka 1996).
The method has been used in some academic institutions and universities to develop urban projects in Bari, Dar es Salaam, Cairo and Tehran within a consistent metropolitan context.
Madrid Metropolitan Plan
The Madrid Metropolitan Plan was the first application, under the direction of Pedro B. Ortiz, of the CT method, approved administratively in 1996 and backed by the Madrid Regional Parliament in May 1997.
The Plan was the physical continuation of a previously developed exercise of Strategic Urban Planning in 1989-1994 and established a framework for the future development of the Metropolis of Madrid. The numerous territorial decisions taken during the enforcement period until the new Planning Law of 2001 required revision and approval, have been determinant to the actual shape and efficiency of the metropolitan structure of Madrid.
Under the plan, to respond to the rapid growth Madrid was experiencing (50% every 20 years), the Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning methodology was set in place. The CT Method principles are the foundation of the design, implementation and management of this Metropolitan Plan.

The first season of the Australian drama-series Sea Patrol premiered on the Nine Network on 5 July 2007. The 13-episode season concluded 4 October 2007. Set aboard HMAS Hammersley, an old Royal Australian Navy (RAN) patrol boat, the series follows the ship's company as they investigate the deaths of several people who are linked by a web of intrigue.
Filming commenced in October 2006 and concluded in February 2007. Most of the material was shot aboard the patrol boat , with up to 60 casts, film crew, and ship's company. They crammed aboard a vessel designed to hold only 24 people, in tropical Queensland conditions. Other filming occurred on Dunk Island, in Sydney, and at the Movie World Studios in Queensland.
The show was one of the most eagerly awaited of 2007, with the project marking Lisa McCune's return to television acting. Ratings for the first episode were the second-highest for a drama premiere in Australian history, and surpassed the NRL State of Origin match earlier in the week. Initial reviews were mixed, with concern that the series would be restricted by the early timeslot, poor scripts, and clichéd characters and storylines. Critical reception improved as the series progressed, but ratings fell.
Plot
The first season story arc involves the Australian Federal Police's investigation into the death of marine biologist Dr. Lisa Holmes, Kate's relationship with freighter Captain Rick Gallagher, Mike's relationship with Lisa's partner, Dr. Ursula Morrell, and the deaths of two fishermen, Carl Davies and Sam Murray. These threads increasingly intertwine throughout the season, culminating in the final two episodes, in which it is revealed that Gallagher hired Ursula and Lisa to manufacture a deadly toxin from an unusual venomous crab that he planned to sell on the black market. The plot is thwarted, the boat carrying the poison is sunk, Gallagher is killed and Ursula's death is staged as she enters a witness protection program.
During the season, Nav and ET develop a relationship despite adversities: Chefo becomes engaged to his girlfriend; Swain's wife, Sally, gives birth; Charge reluctantly gets help for, and recovers from, an eye injury; Spider loses friend and shipmate Jaffah to a jellyfish sting; Robert comes to terms with his father's death and Lt. Daryl Smith has a mostly off-screen and implied relationship with AFP Agent Alicia Turnball.
Production
Filming for this season started on 9 October 2006 and concluded on 20 February 2007. The Pacific Film and Television Corporation offered the producers $750,000 as an incentive to film the series in Queensland.
Much of the filming was carried out off tropical Queensland on a RAN patrol boat. This boat was built to accommodate 24 people, but up to 60 members of cast and crew were aboard the small boat, and a vast catamaran was used by the wardrobe department.

Critical response
In 2007, Sea Patrol was one of the most eagerly-awaited television series in Australia. The series marked Lisa McCune's return to television and the Nine Network's attempt to reclaim its former ratings.
Almost 2 million viewers watched the first episode; this was first place in the ratings. It was the second most popular series premiere in Australian history. Sea Patrol's premiere drew a larger audience than the NRL State of Origin match broadcast the same week, a rarity for an untested local drama. Critics described the script as "...dated, unsophisticated and a little clichéd". In the Sun Herald, the television critic stated that "...the series is let down by a somewhat sinking script that fails to quickly engage". Hal McElroy was disappointed; he believed the Australian drama industry failed due to a lack of good writing and a "...fail[ure] to create stories that connected with mass audience". Another common complaint from critics was the "safety" of the story-lines. The series was developed as a 7:30 pm drama; story-lines had to be appropriate for that time-slot. These complaints lasted throughout the season. In The Daily Telegraph, for example, Sea Patrol was described as "decent but safe drama". This was not what the Nine Network had hoped from their $15 million drama.
The show was given a promising review from the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), published in Navy News, which stated that Navy personnel were glad the show did not "...embarrass the service or give false perceptions" and were also happy with the portrayal of life in the RAN. Regardless of the critical comments of Sea Patrol, Nine commissioned a second season before the first was broadcast.
While the critical response improved, ratings continued to drop throughout the season.
Ratings
The first episode of Sea Patrol was the second-highest rating series premiere, surpassing the debut of McLeod's Daughters at 1.89 million, but not the debut of Always Greener at 2.06 million, both of which were cancelled by their respective networks.
Notes
Awards
Sea Patrol was nominated for three awards at the 2008 Logie Awards. The nominees included Lisa McCune, who was nominated for Most Popular Actress and the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television. David Lyons was nominated for Most Popular New Male Talent.

The torpedo belt was part of the armouring scheme in some warships between the 1920s and 1940s. It consisted of a series of lightly armoured compartments, extending laterally along a narrow belt that intersected the ship's waterline. In theory this belt would absorb the explosions from torpedoes, or any naval artillery shells that struck below the waterline, and thus minimize internal damage to the ship itself.
Torpedo belts are also known as Side Protection Systems or SPS, or Torpedo Defense System or TDS.
Background: insufficiency of belt armor
Armoured warships (dreadnought battleships, armoured cruisers and later light and heavy cruisers) of the early 20th century carried their main protective armour above the waterline – the "main belt" – which was intended to stop flat-trajectory gunfire from piercing the hull. Below the belt, the armour generally tapered away, to reduce overall weight. This, however, makes a ship vulnerable to hits below the waterline from torpedoes and the occasional large-calibre shell. Extending the belt downwards is impractical, since this increases displacement and draft, reducing speed and seaworthiness.
Torpedo protection schemes
Another solution was needed. Originally, torpedo nets were tried. These were heavy metal mesh nets hung out on booms at some distance from the sides of ships to catch or detonate torpedoes short of the ship. These proved largely ineffective since they could only be deployed when ships were stationary, were useless against shell hits below the waterline, and were ineffective against mines. Some ships were fitted with underwater armor in vulnerable areas below the waterline. This stopped torpedoes from penetrating the ship, but the shock from an underwater explosion could cause damage to weapon mountings and sensitive machinery, along with violently stressing the ships' structure. The German Imperial High Seas Fleet introduced torpedo belts with the first modern armored cruiser SMS Blücher and the simultaneous battleships of the Nassau-class since 1908. It was the only fleet during the duration of the First World War to do so.
Anti-torpedo bulges
The outbreak of World War I increased the urgency to devise an effective torpedo defense system (TDS), thus the British Director of Naval Construction introduced the anti-torpedo bulge. Originally retrofitted to older ships, this was soon added to ships already under construction. In 1915, the British s and in 1917 American s introduced anti-torpedo bulges. Most later capital ships would have at least one torpedo bulkhead inboard of the external hull plating along the area of the ship protected by the armour belt. Most battleships built after World War I had sophisticated and complex side-protection systems, as illustrated by the cross sectional drawing of and .
Torpedo belts
It was not until 1922, in the wake of the Washington Naval Treaty that curtailed ship weights and with the introduction of the British s, that a true layered torpedo belt was introduced. The two Nelsons used a water-filled belt, which was written off in the tonnage limits, as water was not part of the calculations for allowed displacement. Over the next 20 years many innovative designs of TDS were tried by various nations.
A warship can be seriously damaged underwater not only by torpedoes, but also by heavy naval artillery shells that plunge into the ocean very close to the targeted ship. Such shells which are usually armor-piercing shells (AP shells) can pass through a short stretch of water and strike the warship some distance below the waterline. In 1914 typical AP shells were expected to punch a hole in the exterior plate and detonate there with a destructive effect similar to a torpedo. However by the 1940s, advances in AP shell technology incorporated delayed fuses which give AP shells deep penetration capability before exploding; such AP shells will typically make a smaller hole than a torpedo in breaching a ship's hull, but detonating beyond the belt in the hull can cause splinter damage to machinery spaces and secondary magazines, which in turn compromises watertight integrity and encourages progressive flooding. To improve protection against both shells and torpedoes, an airspace can be added between the torpedo belt and the hull to increase the buoyancy of the warship.
Today
After the end of World War II torpedo belts, much like many of the large warships they protected, were rendered obsolete by the widespread use of aircraft, and eventually—especially in the late 60s and into the 70s—by the use of anti-ship missiles, and a new generation of "smart", deep-diving torpedoes (such as the Mark 48) which are designed to detonate under a ship's keel and break its back.

At the same time, Yana, a TVKL reporter who often covered Tiger's murder cases, is also trapped in a fugitive problem faced by Fadil. Fadil is forced to live as a murderer despite his innocence. His first target is Kingkong, a crazy mafia and an enemy to Taji Samprit.
Various acts and situations took place in Fadil's life as a mercenary. The only one way to clear his name is to look for Tiger's true identity to correct the situation and to prove his innocence.
Later that evening, Fadil went to King Kong's club with disguise as the bombay. Before Fadil could kill him, King Kong's already dead. The police arrived at the night club where Tiger (Fadil) allegedly have killed King Kong. Inspector Wahab and his partner pursued Tiger (Fadil) until they met an accident where Inspector Wahab and his colleagues were injured while pursuing Tiger (Fadil).
Wak Doyok paid RM 10 million and hired Fadil to kill Taji Samprit because he had hired him to kill his own mother. He wanted him to kill Taji Samprit and confiscate a lock on which the key was kept by his own father. Inspector Wahab and Inspector Shuib visited Yana's house and questioned the murder of Datin Mona who killed Tiger. Inspector Wahab advised Yana that the suspect was dangerous.
All three have been attacked by Cobra, brother of King Kong. After the car crash, Fadil ordered Ali and Yana to leave and let Fadil stay to fight with Cobra. After Cobra severely attacks Fadil and avenges his brother's death, he forgives Cobra and invites him to his house where RM 500,000 is stashed.
At the same time, Wak Doyok was shocked when his father was still alive and that he has ordered his gangs to attack his own son. He almost defeated Taji Samprit's gangs, including Rudy. He fights with his father but is defeated. Taji Samprit tries to kill Wak Doyok, but is killed by Tiger. He explained to Wak Doyok that Fadil was a subordinate gangster. Wak Doyok got angry and orders him to kill Fadil.
In the warehouse area, Fadil throws the locket to Wak Doyok and Wak Doyok unties Yana, but Tiger and Wak Doyok teamed up together to kill Fadil. Starting in the final showdown, Fadil and Yana escaped from Wak Doyok but to no avail. While Cobra fights with Tiger to avenge his brother's death. Fadil wants to kill Wak Doyok, until Inspector Wahab and Inspector Shuib surround all the warehouse areas. Inspector Shuib aims Inspector Wahab because Shuib knows he is the Taji's right-hand man. But Inspector Wahab explained that Fadil was innocent. However, Inspector Wahab hired Rudy to work as a police officer. Wahab's inspector reminded that the camouflage of Tiger, Ali.
Continued in the final showdown, Cobra was killed by Ali. Inspector Wahab and Inspector Shuib chased Ali up to Inspector Wahab and Inspector Shuib shot Ali with some explosives. Ali revives, but Inspector Wahab shoots Ali to death. Wak Doyok fights with Fadil again, until Wak Doyok defeats Fadil. Wak Doyok wanted to kill Fadil but he was saved by Yana who gets a bullet shot by firing gun of Wak Doyok. Fadil was very angry, then fought Wak Doyok. Fadil managed to defeat Wak Doyok and police arrested Wak Doyok. Yana was sent to hospital after being shot by Wak Doyok. Inspector Wahab and Inspector Shuib thanked Fadil for assisting the police and frees Fadil.
Fadil opens Taji's container using Taji's key in the locket. There is a bunch of money that Taji Samprit kept. Now Fadil and Yana becomes rich.

Diplophonia, also known as diphthongia, is a phenomenon in which a voice is perceived as being produced with two concurrent pitches. Diplophonia is a result of vocal fold vibrations that are quasi-periodic in nature. It has been reported from old days, but there is no uniform interpretation of established mechanisms. It has been established that diplophonia can be caused by various vocal fold pathologies, such as vocal folds polyp, vocal fold nodule, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis or vestibular fold hypertrophy.
The Voice Quality Symbol for diplophonia is V̬‼.

Marykkundoru Kunjaadu () is a 2010 Malayalam-language comedy film directed by Shafi, starring Dileep, Biju Menon and Bhavana with Vijayaraghavan, Vinaya Prasad, Jagathy Sreekumar and Innocent in supporting roles. The film was released on 25 December 2010 which went on to become a commercial success completing 150 days and eventually became the second highest grossing Malayalam film of 2010 after Kaaryasthan.
The movie was remade by Priyadarshan in Hindi in 2012 as Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal.
Synopsis
The story takes place in a remote village in the Kerala Highranges. Solomon (Dileep), the son of the village sexton, Geevarghese (Vijayaraghavan), a simple soul who is quiet in nature and fears virtually everything around, thus earning the nickname Kunjaadu (little lamb). His mother, Mary (Vinaya Prasad), was Ittichan's (Innocent) crush. He named his daughter Mary (Bhavana) after Solomon's mother. He wanted Solomon to love his daughter dearly and then he would marry her to some other person so that he gets to know the pain that he felt when he lost his love. He promises the church that he will give another cross made out of gold to the church if Solomon marries some other girl but if he wants to marry his daughter then Solomon must give a cross to church. Mary has been in love with Solomon right from their childhood days. Meanwhile, a man (Biju Menon), who looks like a thug, comes to Solomon's house and Solomon, who is overjoyed at getting some fearless company, gets the man accepted by his whole family under the illusion that he is his long-lost brother Jose. He does so much for the family and gets involved in agriculture and develops the family's living. Later, Solomon finds that there is more to his so-called brother than he thought initially, and that he killed a girl and was imprisoned for seven years. Finally he finds out that Jose has stolen the cross and hid it in Solomon's land seven years ago and has returned to retrieve it. Solomon warns his family that even if he is their brother, they should be alert or else he'll burn down the house. His parents don't take it seriously but later when the family is away, Jose burns the house down and everyone thinks it is Solomon who did it. Solomon later finds out that Jose's old friend, who also wants the golden cross, was the one who killed the girl, who was actually Jose's lover. A fight occurs between Solomon and both the thieves. Jose's friend gets beaten up and rings the church bell telling that he got the cross and saves Jose by telling that he was the one who help him capture the thief, and because Solomon always considered him as a brother. Everyone is happy and Ittichan gives his daughter's hand to Solomon.

The Gryphon Trio is a Canadian classical music ensemble that has been nominated for several and has won three Juno Awards for its classical recordings released by the Analekta label. Its members are Annalee Patipatanakoon (violin), Roman Borys (cello) and Jamie Parker (piano).
History
The Gryphon Trio was formed in 1993 by three members of the Faculty of Music of the University of Toronto, Patipatanakoon, Borys and Parker, and today it tours regularly throughout Canada, the United States and Europe.
Its 15 recordings for Analekta include works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Dvorak, Lalo and Shostakovich and have expanded the number of recordings of the piano trio repertoires of these composers. In addition, the Trio has commissioned and premiered more than 75 new works by contemporary composers.
The Trio has received two Juno Awards for Classical Album of the Year: the first for its 2004 album Canadian Premieres, which features works by 20th-century Canadian composers, and the second for its 2011 recording of Beethoven's "Ghost" piano trio, Beethoven: Piano Trios, Op. 70, No. 1, "Ghost"; Op. 11.
It celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2003 with a performance in Toronto that included the North American premiere of a then recently discovered piano trio score by the Romanian composer George Enescu.
In 2008, the Trio performed extensively the Greek-Canadian composer Christos Hatzis's multi-media composition Constantinople to international critical acclaim. Hatzis himself received a Juno Award for the writing of Constantinople.
In 2010, the Trio launched its pioneering community outreach project Listen Up! in Almonte, Ontario. Listen Up! has been described as "a unique arts outreach initiative that engages an entire community in the composition of a new work for piano trio and choir". With the support of the BMO Financial Group and other private sponsors, it has since travelled to Hamilton, Midland and Ottawa, Ontario.
In September 2011, with the Canadian soprano Patricia O'Callaghan, the Trio released the album Broken Hearts & Madmen, which features songs by Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Lhasa de Sela and Elvis Costello alongside Latin American folksongs from Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.
The Trio's most recent recording, For the End of Time (2012), with the Canadian clarinetist James Campbell, features the music of Olivier Messiaen, Alexina Louie and Valentin Silvestrov and is its fifteenth CD for the Analekta label.
In 2016, the trio teamed up with McMaster University's LIVELab to research how musicians' body movements help them communicate and play as a group more effectively.

Dušica Stojković () is a politician in Serbia. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2014 as a member of the Serbian Progressive Party.
Early life and career
Stojković was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She is a graduate of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Political Sciences in the department of international relations; has co-ordinated local non-government organizations in the fields of democracy, human rights, youth policy, and entrepreneurship; and has been head of the information service in the Belgrade municipality of Rakovica.
Politician
Municipal politics
Stojković joined the Progressive Party on its formation in 2009. She received the sixth position on the party's electoral list for the Rakovica municipal assembly in the 2012 Serbian local elections and was elected when the list won a plurality victory with seventeen out of fifty seats. She did not seek re-election in 2016.
She also received the fifty-first position on the Progressive Party's list for the City Assembly of Belgrade in 2012. The list won thirty-seven mandates and she was not returned. She was promoted to the thirteenth position in the 2014 Belgrade City Assembly election and was elected when the list won a majority of victory with sixty-three mandates. She ultimately chose not to serve at the city level, resigning her mandate on 23 April 2014.
Parliamentarian
Stojković received the seventy-second position on the Progressive Party's Aleksandar Vučić — Future We Believe In electoral list for the 2014 Serbian parliamentary election and was elected when the list won a landslide victory with 158 out of 250 mandates. She was promoted to the thirty-ninth position on the successor Aleksandar Vučić — Serbia is winning list for the 2016 parliamentary election and was re-elected when the list won 131 mandates.
During the 2016–20 parliament, Stojković was a member of the assembly's foreign affairs committee, European integration committee, and committee on administrative, budgetary, mandate, and immunity issues; a deputy member of the foreign affairs committee; a deputy member of the European Union–Serbia stabilization and association parliamentary committee; a member of Serbia's delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE PA); and a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Germany, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Uganda, and the United States of America.

King's Cliffe (variously spelt Kings Cliffe, King's Cliff, Kings Cliff, Kingscliffe) is a village and civil parish on Willow Brook, a tributary of the River Nene, about northeast of Corby in North Northamptonshire. The parish adjoins the county boundary with the City of Peterborough and the village is about west of the city centre. The village is not far from the boundary with Lincolnshire and about south of Stamford.
Population
The 2001 Census recorded a parish population of 1,137 people, increasing to 1,202 at the 2011 Census.
The 1871 Census recorded a parish population of 1259. The 1891 Census recorded the parish population as having fallen to 1,082, occupying 262 "inhabited houses"
King's Cliffe is very small but is growing in size. There is a school named King's Cliffe Endowed Primary. It used to be located next to John Wooding's Groceries but in recent years, a new building was developed on King's Forest. This new school is very large in size and is very advanced.
Parish church
The Church of England parish church of All Saints has a central tower that is Norman, with late 13th century upper parts and broach spire. The nave has a Decorated Gothic west window and there are north and south aisles with 14th century arcades. The font is also 14th century. Later features are the Perpendicular Gothic clerestory, roof and remodelling of the north and south arches supporting the tower. Inside the church is a monument erected in 1623 to the Thorpe family, whose descendant John Thorpe (1565–1655) was a notable Elizabethan and Jacobean architect.
Economic and social history
Hall Yard Farmhouse was built in 1603. Inside the house, Dr Law's Music Room has an 18th-century Georgian coved ceiling with decoration in the style of Robert Adam. Law's Chapel, also 18th century, is nearby.
Parts of King's Cliffe Manor House are early 17th century.
In the summer of 1845, the Reverend Miles Joseph Berkeley, the rector of All Saints' church, proposed, after observing potatoes from near the village struck by potato blight, that the causative agent of the blight was a fungus. This was contradictory to theories at the time, which suggested that the fungus was merely a symptom of decay, and not the causative agent of the blight. Berkeley labelled the fungus he found Botrytis infestans, now known as Phytophthora infestans.
King's Cliffe is unusual in having three sets of almshouses. The John Thorpe Almshouses were built in 1668, the Widows' Almshouses in 1749 and the Spinsters' Almshouses in 1754. The Widows' and Spinsters' almshouses were part of a set of charities founded by Rev. Dr William Law (1686–1761) and his disciple, Mrs Elizabeth Hutcheson. A house dating from about 1700 was made a Schoolmaster's House in 1745, and next to it the Boys' School was built in 1748. From 1752 the Schoolmaster's House became Law's Library, which housed Law's religious books and lent them to people of King's Cliffe and neighbouring towns.
King's Cliffe railway station was on a branch line that ran between and . The London and North Western Railway opened it in 1879 and British Railways closed it in 1966.
RAF King's Cliffe was opened in 1942 and returned to agricultural use in 1959. It was about east of the village.

Georges Hilaire Bousquet (March 3, 1845 – January 15, 1937) was a French legal scholar who contributed to the development of the legal codes of the Empire of Japan.
Biography
Bousquet was born in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France. He was a graduate of the University of Paris and was working as a lawyer for the Court of Appeals in Paris when approached by Samejima Naonobu, a Japanese diplomat recruiting foreign advisors for the government of Meiji period Japan on December 24, 1871. Bousquet sailed from the port of Marseilles on February 16, 1872. Aged only 26 at the time, Bousquet was assigned to work with fellow Frenchman Gustave Emile Boissonade for four years. He assisted in translation of the Napoleonic Code in the Japanese language, and in drafting much of Japan's civil code.
Bousquet also taught at the Meihoryo (Law School of the Ministry of Justice).
After his return to France, he resumed his legal career, rising to the post of Deputy Director of Criminal Justice in France, and was subsequently elected to the Council of State in July 1879. In January 1898, he became Director of the Customs Department under the French Ministry of Finance, and is noted for having reduced import taxes on Japanese sake into France. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (2nd class) in October of the same year.
Bousquet also wrote a book Le Japon de Nos Jours et les Echelles de l'Extreme Orient: Ouvrage Contenant Trois Cartes in 1877, describing his time in Japan. The work is notable as perhaps the first European attempt to describe the contents of The Tale of Genji, which would later be regarded as a classic of world literature, although Bousquet confused it with The Tale of the Heike.
He died in Paris in 1937, and his grave is at the Montmartre Cemetery.

Reo Franklin Fortune (27 March 1903 – 25 November 1979) was a New Zealand-born social anthropologist. Originally trained as a psychologist, Fortune was a student of some of the major theorists of British and American social anthropology including Alfred Cort Haddon, Bronislaw Malinowski and Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. He lived an international life, holding various academic and government positions: in China, at Lingnan University from 1937 to 1939; in Toledo, Ohio, USA from 1940 to 1941; at the University of Toronto, from 1941 to 1943; in Burma, as government anthropologist, from 1946 to 1947; and finally, at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom from 1947 to 1971, as lecturer in social anthropology specialising in Melanesian language and culture.
He was first married to Margaret Mead in 1928, with whom he undertook field studies in New Guinea from 1931 to 1933. They divorced in 1936. Fortune subsequently married Eileen Pope, also a New Zealander, in 1937.
Fortune provided significant insights into the consequences of matrilateral and patrilateral cross-cousin marriage in advance of work by Claude Levi-Strauss. He is also known for his contribution to mathematics with his study of Fortunate numbers in number theory.
The 2014 novel Euphoria by Lily King is a fictionalized account of the relationships between Fortune, Mead and Gregory Bateson in pre-WWII New Guinea.

Sinners and Saints is a 2010 action-thriller film directed by and co-written by William Kaufman and starring Johnny Strong, Kevin Phillips, Costas Mandylor, Sean Patrick Flanery, Bas Rutten, Method Man, Kim Coates and Tom Berenger. The film is set in the dark underbelly of New Orleans. It was released in North America on DVD and Blu-ray on January 10, 2012.
Plot
Sean Riley, a detective with the New Orleans Police Department, is emotionally drained since the death of his young son and resulting end of his marriage. He is further troubled by the death of his partner, Det. Dave Besson. Riley's commander, Captain Trahan, assigns Riley to investigate a series of murders involving victims who have been burned. One of the victims is the younger brother of infamous gangster Weddo, which has sparked a gang war in the city.
Riley is approached by Colin, a friend he had lost touch with. Colin tells Riley that since they served in the military together, he has gotten various freelance jobs with a private security company called Spartan.
Riley is assigned a new partner, Detective Will Ganz, a stable family man. They stumble into a group of mercenaries in the act of burning another victim, and a shootout ensues.
Riley and Ganz learn that a man named Raymond Crowe hired the mercenaries. As the investigation continues, Riley learns that Colin is in possession of incriminating evidence against Spartan: a video of the same mercenaries from the shootout executing innocents while on assignment. When the partners track down Colin, they are attacked by the mercenaries, now revealed to be Spartan Security. A mortally wounded Colin blows up the house he is in so that Riley and Ganz can escape.
When Riley learns from Captain Trahan that the city wants to blame Riley for the disastrous results of the investigation, Riley decides to take matters into his own hands. Trahan goes to Riley's home to try to talk him out of it, but is ambushed and killed by Dekker, a leader of the Spartan mercenaries. Dekker attacks Riley, but Riley manages to kill him.
Riley learns that Crowe has kidnapped Ganz. He breaks into Crowe's stronghold and kills the remaining mercenaries. Crowe manages to escape, as Riley gives chase. Crowe manages to shoot Riley, but Riley shoots him down in the street. Riley is about to kill Crowe, with Ganz shouting at him to do it, but Riley decides not to. Weddo and his gang arrive and take Crowe with them, presumably to kill him.
Later, Riley visits Ganz's child's birthday party, then visits the cemetery where his own son is buried.

Cheliceratichnus, meaning trace of a chelicerate arthropod, is an ichnogenus erected for a body imprint discovered in the Lower Jurassic East Berlin Formation of Holyoke, Massachusetts. The specimen is now housed at the Springfield Science Museum, which is one of multiple museums on the Quadrangle (Springfield, Massachusetts). Considering that only a single specimen was found, the ichnogenus is monospecific, with the species name lockleyi honoring paleontologist and ichnologist Martin Lockley. In trace fossil classification schemes based on behavior, the body imprint is considered a cubichnion, or resting trace. Cheliceratichnus lockleyi exhibits the tagma characteristic of arthropods, with the trace divided into anterior, central, and posterior regions. Dalman and Lucas (2015) interpreted these regions as imprints of the chelicerae, prosoma, and opisthosoma, respectively, of a chelicerate arthropod. Additionally, imprints of the animal's legs and telson were identified. These authors noted that, in general, the pattern of the trace was similar to the body plan of the Solifugae, or camel spiders, but also noted that the presence of a telson imprint rules out that group because these animals lack telsons. Consequently, they attributed the trace to a solifuge-like arthropod without being more committal on what made it. In addition to the body imprint, the animal produced a trackway, called Acanthichnus cursorius, leading away from the body imprint, which demonstrates that the animal was alive at the time its body imprinted the sediment.
The location from which the specimen was derived, the Gaulin Dinosaur Tracksite, has been interpreted as a playa, or dry lake environment based on the presence of oscillation ripple marks, abundant mudcracks, and other sedimentary structures. Dinosaur tracks called Anomoepus lacertoideus were found near Cheliceratichnus lockleyi, on the same bedding plane, and their describers, Dalman and Weems (2013), interpreted them as those of small ornithischians. Other trace fossils found at the site include invertebrate trace fossils such as the arthropod trackway Bifurculapes, and the burrows Planolites and Treptichnus.

The Malagasy white-eye (Zosterops maderaspatanus) is a species of bird in the white-eye family, Zosteropidae. Found in Madagascar and Seychelles, its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.
Taxonomy
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Malagasy white-eye in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Madagascar. He used the French name Le petit figuier de Madagascar and the Latin Ficedula Madagascariensis minor. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Malagasy white-eye. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Motacilla maderaspatana and cited Brisson's work. Although Linnaeus gave the type locality as Madagascar he confusingly used the specific name maderaspatana which is New Latin for Madras (now Chennai) in India. This species is now placed in the genus Zosterops that was introduced by the naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827.
Four subspecies are recognised:
Z. m. aldabrensis Ridgway, 1894 – island of Aldabra (southwest Seychelles)
Z. m. maderaspatanus (Linnaeus, 1766) – Madagascar and Glorioso Islands (off northwest Madagascar)
Z. m. voeltzkowi Reichenow, 1905 – Europa Island (southwest Madagascar)
Z. m. menaiensis Benson, 1969 – Cosmoledo Atoll and Astove Island (southwest Seychelles)
Description
This white-eye grows to a length of about . The upperparts, wings and tail are a dark olive green, the throat is yellow and the breast and belly pale grey. The white eye ring is incomplete, there being a gap at the front of the reddish-brown eye. The upper mandible of the beak is black and the lower mandible is grey. The legs and feet are greyish-blue.
Distribution and habitat
The Malagasy white-eye occurs in Madagascar and the Seychelles. Small groups of these birds can be found in woodland, foraging among the branches and flitting between the trees, calling constantly to each other with a soft "pee-u".
Behaviour and ecology
A lively and agile bird, its flight is strong but jerky, each flight covering only a short distance. It feeds in the open during the day and moves deeper into the forest at night. It likes to bathe in pools and also makes use of water trapped in hollows in trees for this purpose. Mutual preening sometimes takes place, with two birds almost leaning on one another as they preen around the head, face and chin.
The diet consists mainly of invertebrates and fruits, also including nectar, pollen, flower buds and other vegetable matter. Insects are found by gleaning on twigs and branches, the bird sometimes clinging upside-down to the trunk of a tree. Prey is sometimes caught in the air by hawking, and the bird may hover briefly while taking food, and probe into inflorescences and lichens, sometimes becoming dusted with pollen.
Breeding takes place in the austral summer. The nest is a cup-shaped structure hung from the fork of a branch or built in the middle of a bush. It is made from grass stems and flower heads, fine rootlets, slender fibres, hairs and moss. Two to three eggs are laid.
Status

William Boyd, FRCPath, (June 21, 1885 – March 10, 1979) was a Scottish-Canadian physician, pathologist, academic, and author known for his medical textbooks.
Biography
William was born in Portsoy, Scotland, the sixth child of Dugald Cameron Boyd (a Presbyterian clergyman) and Eliza Marion (née Butcher) Boyd. Educated at the University of Edinburgh, he graduated M.B. Ch.B. in 1908, M.D. in 1911, and went on to become trained and accredited as a neurologist, psychiatrist, and pathologist. Boyd worked as an attending physician and nominal pathologist at the Derby County Asylum in the English Midlands from 1909–1912, and at Winwick Hospital (another neuropsychiatric facility) from 1912–1913. He was a pathologist at Wolverhampton Royal Infirmary from 1913 to August 1914. During World War I, Boyd served as a general medical officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Flanders at the rank of captain (O3). In 1916 he wrote the book, With a Field Ambulance at Ypres, describing his experiences as both a physician and an ordinary combatant in the war zone.
After the conflict, Boyd moved to Canada at the urging of friends from medical school who were already working there. He married Enid Christie, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, in Winnipeg, Manitoba in June 1919. Boyd became a Professor of Pathology in the Manitoba Medical College at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg and over the next 22 years, he wrote several pathology textbooks that were published and read internationally. These earned him worldwide recognition and financial security. In 1937, he moved to the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario and, ultimately, in 1951 to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia. Boyd continued to be an active lecturer on medical-pathological topics well into this 80s [???Check. Boyd died in 1979], and spoke in many different countries.
In 1968, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honor, "for his services as a pathologist and as a founding member of the National Cancer Institute". Boyd died of pneumonia at the age of 93 in Toronto. He was survived by his wife Enid; the couple had had no children.

Dzibanche () (sometimes spelt Tz'ibanche) is an archaeological site of the ancient Maya civilization located in southern Quintana Roo, in the Yucatan Peninsula of southeastern Mexico. Dzibanche was a major Maya city and investigations in the first decade of the 21st century indicate that it was the early capital of the Kan dynasty, which later ruled from the great city of Calakmul. Dzibanche features the earliest known use of the Kaan dynasty emblem glyph.
Location and etymology
The name Dzibanche means "writing on wood" in the Mayan language; taking its name from the sculpted wooden lintels of the Temple of the Lintels. Dzibanche is situated northeast of the contemporary city of Calakmul. The ruins lie in the south of Mexico's Quintana Roo state, a short distance inland from the Bacalar Lagoon. The ruins of the city are situated on a raised area surrounded by an extensive area of seasonal swampland, known as a bajo, featuring particularly fertile soils.
History
During the Early Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology the city may have been the seat of the Kan ("snake") dynasty that later ruled from Calakmul to the southwest; Dzibanche appears to have been the Kan capital in the 5th and 6th centuries. The hieroglyphic stairway at Dzibanche contains the earliest known use of the Kan dynasty Emblem glyph, dated to AD 495. Around 580 to 590, the Kan dynasty apparently moved their dynastic seat to Calakmul. At the end of the Terminal Classic period, Dzibanche was one of the last cities in the Maya area to create a dated hieroglyphic text, in AD 909.
Site description
Dzibanche was a large city featuring architecture in the Peten style. Excavations have uncovered a hieroglyphic stairway depicting sculpted representations of bound captives, captured by Yuknoom Ch'een I, a Kan dynasty king of Dzibanche. One of these captives is named as Yax K'ahk' Jolo'm and, although his place of origin is not mentioned in the accompanying text, the form of his name indicates that he came from a city relatively close to Dzibanche itself. At least two of sculpted blocks may date to the 5th century AD.
The most important structures at Dzibanche include the Temple of the Captives, the Temple of the Lintels and the Temple of the Owl. The K'inichna' Pyramid is a large temple located outside of the site core. The Lamay Group is a small outlying architectural group that formed a part of the city.
The Cormoranes Pyramid is the largest pyramid at Dizibanche. It was built during the 5th century AD using the Teotihuacan-influenced talud-tablero style of Maya architecture. The pyramid is decorated with friezes that were sculpted from stucco and coated with red paint; the friezes feature symbols that are also in the Teotihuacan style. The structure is the funerary pyramid of Sky Witness, one of the kings of the Kan dynasty.
The K'inich Na' Pyramid ("House of the Sun God") is a large pyramid approximately north of the site core. Two royal burials were discovered inside the structure, accompanied by jade offerings. The K'inich Na' Pyramid is surrounded by a number of smaller palace-type structures and the group is linked to the site core by a causeway. The group was likely to be the home of an elite lineage group and was placed to extend the city's region of control over the northern parts of the surrounding bajo.

Showboat, Inc., a United States-based organization in the casino and entertainment industry, made its initial public offering in 1969. Later that year, Ramada Inns agreed to buy the company for $15 million in stock, but negotiations failed because of conditions set by Houssels, who wanted cash for his 24% stake.
Showboat, Inc. expanded over time, opening Showboat Atlantic City in 1987, Sydney Harbor Casino in 1995, and Showboat Mardi Gras in East Chicago in 1997.
In 1998, Harrah's Entertainment bought Showboat, Inc. for $1.15 billion. Harrah's interests were primarily in the Atlantic City and Chicago markets, however; the Showboat Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas did not fit with the company's strategy. The property was sold in 2000 for $23.5 million to VSS Enterprises, a group owned by Dan Shaw, Mike Villamor, and Greg Schatzman.

And Also the Trees are an English post-punk band, formed in 1979 in Inkberrow, Worcestershire. They are characterised by their poetic lyrics and evocative music which are strongly influenced by the native English countryside.
History
And Also the Trees formed in 1979 in Inkberrow, a large village in Worcestershire, with a lineup featuring two sets of brothers: Simon Huw Jones (vocals), Justin Jones (guitar), Graham Havas (bass) and Nick Havas (drums).
1980s
The band made their live debut on 12 January 1980 at Grieg Memorial Hall in Alcester. A home demo tape was sent to The Cure, who were looking for support bands on their tour, leading to a friendship between the two bands. In 1981, And Also the Trees played several shows in support of The Cure's UK tour. Their second demo tape, From Under the Hill (1982), was partly co-produced by Robert Smith and Mike Hedges. Graham Havas was replaced at this time by Steven Burrows.
In 1983, the band released their first single, "Shantell", which was produced by The Cure's Lol Tolhurst. Their second single, "The Secret Sea", followed in 1984 and was also produced by Tolhurst. Tolhurst also produced their debut studio album, And Also the Trees, which was released in February 1984. The band received the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and were invited to do a session in April 1984, which was produced by Dale Griffin for broadcast on 24 April.
The EP A Room Lives in Lucy (1985) introduced the mandolin-like guitar sound which became their trademark for the next few years. It gave the band their only placing on the UK Independent Chart, peaking at number 30. The next album, Virus Meadow (1986), was followed by their first European tour, which yielded the live album The Evening of the 24th (1987). Another EP, The Critical Distance, was released in 1987. The singles "Shaletown" and "The House of the Heart", and the next album The Millpond Years (1988,) were produced by Mark Tibenham.
Farewell to the Shade (1989) was followed by the single releases of "Lady D'Arbanville" (a completely revised Cat Stevens cover) and the French-only "Misfortunes".
1990s
In 1990, they changed their management. The band toured America during the following year, and reactivated contact with the Cure, which resulted in the USA-only release of the EP The Pear Tree featuring a remix by Robert Smith and Mark Saunders.
In 1992, the band released their last album produced by Tibenham, Green Is the Sea. They promoted it with a two-leg European tour including Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and France. Fan pressure resulted in a digital remastering of their singles and EPs, and the release of From Horizon to Horizon, a CD collection of primarily single and non-album tracks between 1983–1992.
They issued their sixth studio album The Klaxon in 1993, and the band toured during the following year, which resulted in the release of the live album Le Bataclan and a tour video from a concert in Hamburg.
In 1995, Justin Jones and Tibenham, along with Antonia Reiner, collaborated on a project called G. O. L., which resulted in the release of the album Sensations of Tone and the single "Soma Holiday". The album featured a cover version of the early And Also The Trees song "There Were No Bounds".
The band's seventh studio album, Angelfish (1996), centred on a British perception of Americana. It was the last album with drummer Nick Havas, who was replaced by Paul Hill.
Their eighth studio album, Silver Soul (1998), was also the band's first release on their own record label. The band released an EP, Nailed, the same year as well as a video compilation, Live 89-98. On the 23 April 1998 the band played their first UK date in seven years at the Axiom Arts Centre in Cheltenham.
2000s
After a five-year break, And Also the Trees released Further from the Truth (2003), recorded in the Worcestershire countryside and co-produced with Matthew Devenish.
In 2004 and 2005, And Also the Trees played several shows at music festivals such as the Paleo Festival and Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Germany. They celebrated their 25th anniversary with the Best of 1980–2005 compilation album.
Live in Geneva (2006) showed the band in action on their Further from the Truth tour, as well as some video and film projects. That same year, Simon Huw Jones collaborated with Bernard Trontin of the Young Gods for a project called November, releasing an eponymous album on Swiss label Shayo.
And Also the Trees' 10th album, (Listen For) The Rag and Bone Man, was issued in November 2007. It featured two new members, Ian Jenkins (double bass) and Emer Brizzolara (keyboards, dulcimer and melodica). The accompanying photographs were taken by French photographer Jérôme Sevrette.
In June 2009, the band released When the Rains Come, containing acoustic versions of previously released songs and one new track. This was followed by another acoustic album, titled Driftwood.
2010s
In the summer of 2011, the band worked on new material in Herefordshire and France. Later that year, Justin Jones provided guest guitar on the Othon Mataragas album Impermanence (with Marc Almond on vocals, and also featuring Ernesto Tomasini, Laura Moody and Camille O'Sullivan), followed by an intimate concert at London's Chelsea Theatre to launch the album.
The band's 12th studio album, Hunter Not the Hunted, was released in March 2012.
And Also the Trees' 13th album, Born Into the Waves, was released on 18 March 2016. The band's current live lineup also includes Grant Gordon on bass guitar and Colin Ozanne on clarinet, guitar and keyboard.
Musical style
And Also the Trees have been described as a gothic rock group. The band's aesthetic sensibility has also been related to British Romanticism and melancholy in poetry and the arts.

Mario Brell (born 1936) Santiago-Verlag Goch 2006 is a German operatic tenor.
Life
Brell was born in Hamburg and grew up in the district of Barmbek. First, he started an apprenticeship as a painter and varnisher. With his brothers he joined a male choir, the "Mozart Quartet" in Hamburg-Wandsbek, which still exists today. There, he was discovered and promoted by the choirmaster Ernst Haddorp, who eventually introduced him to Carl Gotthard, with whom Brell began his vocal training.
In addition to his singing training, Brell took acting and dance lessons, at first continuing to work in his teaching profession in the construction industry.
After only two years of training, Brell was engaged at the Theater Hof. Another year later, he successfully passed his final examination as an opera singer at the Hamburgische Staatsoper.
Brell serves a highly extensive repertoire of over 30 operettas and over 80 opera roles and over the years has worked in all genres from operetta to Wagner, from lyrical tenor to heroic tenor.
After a serious heart operation in 1997, he had to leave the stage and could not sing for a long time. With the support of his family and his autobiography "Drum sei bedankbar", which he wrote during this time, he fought his way back into life - and onto the stages.

Thomas Prout Webb (22 January 1845 – 22 November 1916) was an Australian barrister and judge.
Webb was the fourth son of Robert Saunders Webb, the first collector of customs at Port Phillip, by his wife Ann, daughter of Lieutenant Fisher, R.N., was born at Newtown (now called Fitzroy), Melbourne. Mr. Webb was educated at the Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, and at the University of Melbourne (B.A., 1867) where he studied under professor William Hearn. He then studied at King's College London, entered at Lincoln's Inn in November 1867, and was called to the Bar in June 1870, having won the Inns of Court Exhibition in Constitutional Law and Legal History in the previous year.
Webb was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1872, and practised on the equity side of the Supreme Court until 1884, when he was appointed assistant chief clerk under the Judicature Act, the rules of which he assisted in drafting. In October 1884 he succeeded Mr. Wilkinson as Master in Equity and Master in Lunacy. He acted as Deputy Commissioner of Titles during Mr. Bunny's illness, and in 1885, on Mr. Bunny's death, he was Commissioner of Titles for some months concurrently with his other offices. In March 1890 he inaugurated the new procedure in and reorganised the Patents Office, and in March 1891 he also undertook the cognate subject of trademarks under the new legislation then introduced. Webb published in 1872 a successful work on the Imperial law in force in the colony. In 1874 he assisted Mr. J. B. Box in preparing and editing the "Compendium of the Imperial Law and Statutes in Force in the Colony of Victoria" and in 1884 he himself prepared and edited a supplementary volume. Webb was Dr. Ream's principal assistant in the preparation of the former's monumental code.
Webb was commissioner of taxes (1895) and registrar of land tax (1903); in 1901 he was president of the Old Melburnians' Society.

Ethogenics (; "the study of behavior as generated by persons who exhibit a character, an ethos", from Greek ἦθος ethos, "custom, character" and γένος genos, "birth, generation") is an interdisciplinary social scientific approach that attempts to understand the systems of belief or means through which individuals attach significance to their actions and form their identities by linking these to the larger structure of rules (norms) and cultural resources in society. For Rom Harré, the founder of ethogenics, it represents a radical innovation in traditional psychology, even a completely "new psychology" that should take its place. (Harré et al., 1985: 129).
Roots of ethogenics
The origins of ethogenic social science are in microsociology and symbolic interactionism: in particular, Erving Goffman's dramaturgical sociology and Harold Garfinkel's ethnomethodology. Both Goffman and Garfinkel looked at the particular ways in which social actors manage authenticity and construct social order through their performances. Therefore, microsociologists working in this tradition are concerned with the presentation of self in everyday life.
Ethogenic theories
Ethogenicists argue that the unified self (or 'I') emerges through everyday discourse and is enabled through metaphors. Rom Harré states:
All that is personal in our mental and emotional lives is individually appropriated from the conversation going on around us and perhaps idiosyncratically transformed. The structure of our thinking and our feeling will reflect, in various ways, the form and content of that conversation. The main thesis of this work is that mind is no sort of entity, but a system of beliefs structured by a cluster of grammatical models. The science of psychology must be reformed accordingly (1983: 20).
Methodologically, ethogenics starts with the social formation as the primary human reality and then shows how the human self exists within it via personally modified 'templates.'(Harré 1983: 64-65). While Harré makes a distinction between personal and social being, he does not claim that personal being is prior to social being.
By contrast, John Shotter's approach to ethogenics analyzes social action with others (as opposed to individual rule-following and performances), which is said to give individuals 'social powers.' There is no cognitive structure of the social self-independent of social context (Shotter 1983: 33). Therefore, Shotter emphasizes the practical necessities which bring individuals together in moral configurations, which it is necessary to hermeneutically approach. Shotter believes this is a better way to understand the "accounting practices" (and resulting consciousness) of individuals than Harré's methods.
Kenneth Gergen argues that scientific activity (theories) also plays a significant role in constructing the reality and values of individuals. Gergen argues that scientific theories appeal to the common sense within our everyday symbolic world. Societal power relations are affected by groups who try to impose certain frameworks for understanding selfhood, which then guide action (Gergen 1989).
Critique of mainstream social psychology
Ethogenics emerged from a period of crisis in social psychology, representing a rejection of experimental methods (Ginsburg 1995). Such methods apply external "treatments" to groups of individuals rather than studying the personal "sense-making" in which individuals must engage to live in society.

Nash is a village and also a civil parish within the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. It is in the north of the county, about south-west of Milton Keynes and east of Buckingham. According to the 2011 census, the population total of Nash was 417.
History
The village name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means "at the ash-tree". In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was recorded as Esse. The name went through 'Ash' and 'La Nash' to 'Nash'. Between 1870 and 1872, Nash was described as
"NASH, a hamlet in Whaddon parish, Bucks; 5½ miles E of Buckingham. Acres, 1, 430. Real property, £1, 813, Pop., 462. Houses, 103. The property is divided chiefly among five. The hamlet forms chief part of the chapelry of Thornton-cum-Nash; and contains the church of that chapelry, a Baptist chapel, and a national school. Nash Common is a meet for the Whaddon Chase hounds."Nash was designated a civil parish between 1896 and 1899. Before this it was classed as a hamlet within the parish of Whaddon.
Although there has never been a separate manor in Nash, the manor in neighbouring Whaddon has historically been referred to as the manor of Whaddon and Nash. The earliest mention of the manor pre-dates the modern name of 'Nash', and refers to the manor as that of 'Whaddone with Esse'.
Government
The village is served by a parish council of seven members, who are elected every four years, with the next elections set to take place in 2019. However much of the parish council's role is to advise the Aylesbury Vale District Council and Buckinghamshire County Council who make most of the decisions with regards to maintenance and planning.
The village is part of the Great Horwood ward of the Aylesbury Vale District Council. At the county level, the village is part of the Winslow electoral division. Its parliamentary constituency is Buckingham.
Geography
The village is located 46 miles (75 km) north west of London and is about above sea level.
According to the British Geological Survey, the bedrock consists of Mudstone with superficial deposits of sand and gravel from river terraces and glaciofluvia deposits.
The first Land Utilisation Survey of Britain in the 1930s, found the land around Nash to be predominantly 'Meadowland and Permanent Grass', with some areas of 'Forest and Woodland'.
Demography
The most recent, 2011, census of the UK put the total population of Nash at 417. The population has grown sharply since the lowest recorded population total of 214, which was found in the 1961 census. The population previously went through a long period of decline between 1871 (when the highest total population of 460 was recorded) and 1961.
The ethnic composition of Nash is overwhelmingly white, with just 14 individuals identifying as being from other ethnic groups in the 2011 census. Just over 60% of the population identify as Christian, whilst more than 37% either stated that they are not religious, or did not state their religion.
The 2011 census also recorded that 43% of the population were in full-time employment, and 11.4% in part-time employment. Just 2% of the population were identified as being unemployed, which is lower than the average for Aylesbury Vale (3.1%), and England (4.4%).
Economy
Of the 212 members of the population in employment, the majority appear to commute to work, with some of the highest employing industries including 'Wholesale and Retail Trade; Repair of Motor Vehicles and Motorcycles' (18.9%) and 'Manufacturing' (9.4%), neither of which take place within the village. Other sectors with high levels of employment include 'Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities' (13.2%) and 'Education' (12.7%).
This contrasts greatly from some of the traditional industries which were previously common in the village. In 1881, the main industries of the parish were agriculture (40% of the population), and textiles (31% of the population).
Culture and community
Community facilities
After the village school closed in 1948, the building was converted into a community hall for the use of the villagers. The hall is also available for hire, and is used to host several community events throughout the year, as well as the local youth club each week.
Landmarks
The All Saints Church in Nash dates from 1857 when the foundation stone was laid. It was based on designs by renowned architect George Edmund Street.
Education
Nash has not had its own school since it closed in 1948. It now sits within the catchment area of schools in local villages. For aged 4 to 7 this is Whaddon Church of England School, and for 7+ it is covered by Great Horwood Church of England School.

William Paden Hensley (July 24, 1906 or 1909 – August 24, 1991), known as Washboard Willie, was an American Detroit blues musician, who specialised in playing the washboard. He recorded tracks including "A Fool on a Mule in the Middle of The Road" plus "Cherry Red Blues", and worked variously with Eddie "Guitar" Burns, Baby Boy Warren, and Boogie Woogie Red.
Biography
Hensley was born either in Bullock County, Alabama, in 1906, or in Columbus, Georgia, in 1909. "Washboard Willie", as he became known, did not take up music until his thirties. By 1948 he had relocated to Detroit, and in 1952, he watched Eddie "Guitar" Burns performing and played along with Burns' backing group. He impressed the proprietor and ended up with a three-year residency with the band.
Working full-time washing cars for a living, he decided to name his own musical ensemble, Washboard Willie and the Super Suds of Rhythm, working from the name of a once-popular laundry detergent. He graduated from just playing the washboard to incorporate a bass drum and snare and, in 1955, gave Little Sonny his first booking. In 1956, Hensley made his own debut recording of "Cherry Red Blues," with "Washboard Shuffle;" and then "Washboard Blues Pt. 1 & 2." His recording career continued until 1962 utilising Boogie Woogie Red on piano accompaniment. The recordings were not issued until 1969 on Barrelhouse Records. However, in 1966, Willie did release a single with the tracks "Natural Born Lover," and "Wee Baby Blues." His band remained in demand playing nightly in both Detroit and Ann Arbor.
In 1973, he toured Europe with Lightnin' Slim, Moses "Whispering" Smith, Snooky Pryor, Homesick James and Boogie Woogie Red; he also played at the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival that year on the Saturday afternoon "Detroit Blues" show. A compilation album, American Blues Legends '73 was issued on Big Bear Records with Willie contributing the tracks, "I Feel So Fine" and "Kansas City." Six years later he stopped playing professionally.
He died in Detroit in August 1991.

Broadfield House, a Grade II listed building, was home to a glass museum and hot glass studio, owned and operated by Dudley Council museum service and was located in Kingswinford, West Midlands, England. The museum closed on 30 September 2015.
It displayed a huge variety of glass objects, dating from the 17th century to the present day, across nine galleries. In addition to the glass displays were several paintings that demonstrate glass making and the local landscape. The museum also displayed glass making tools and ephemera produced by the glass industry. Various events and temporary exhibitions were held throughout its history. To complete the visitor experience it had a shop that sold various souvenirs, books, vintage glassware and products from contemporary glassmakers.
History of the building
The museum represented the latest chapter for a building that has hosted many contrasting occupants. The original structure was a modest two-storey farmhouse built in the mid or late 18th century and faced Barnett Lane. The threshing barn (now the Hot Glass Studio) dates from the same period and serves as a reminder that two hundred years ago this area was open country and farmland. In the early 1800s the house was transformed into a much grander residence when a fine three-storey Regency block with sash windows and portico was built onto the back of the original building. This then formed the main entrance, reversing the orientation of the original house.
In 1943 the house, along with 16 acres, was purchased by Kenneth George MacMaster, an engineering contactor and property developer. The following year MacMaster sold the house to Dennis Smith from Tividale. Smith was the last private owner of Broadfield House and lived here with his family until 1949. In 1949 the house was acquired by Staffordshire County Council for use as a Mothercraft Hostel.
Following local government reorganisation in 1966 ownership was transferred to the enlarged County Borough of Dudley. In 1969 Broadfield House became an Old People's Home. It was not a suitable site, as illustrated by the 44 stairs and no lift. Following the creation of Dudley MBC in 1974, the Council closed the home and began looking at alternative uses for the building. Inevitably the Mothercraft Hostel and Old People's Home left their mark on the building and features remain that are suggestive of an institutional use.
In 1976 the idea emerged of using the building as a new home for the Council's Brierley Hill and Stourbridge Glass Collections. This met with considerable opposition as the people of Brierley Hill and Stourbridge were very protective of their collections and did not want them moved from their respective towns. At the final Council meeting, the decision to go ahead won by only one vote! Conversion work began in 1979 and Broadfield House Glass Museum was officially opened by Princess Michael of Kent on 2 April 1980.
Exhibitions
The museum held various temporary exhibitions, with local, national and international artists represented, featuring historical and contemporary glassworks.
The Studio
The Hot Glass Studio is sponsored by The Hulbert Group of Dudley and has been made available for use by graduates and established glass-blowers.
Archives and Library
The museum housed archives from various sources, containing such items as pattern books, catalogues, description books and invoices. In addition, there is a large collection of images and recorded material providing insight into the people and the manufacturing process. It also housed an extensive reference library of books and information on glassworking, including the entire library of Robert Charleston, former head of glass and ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum. The Charleston library includes approximately 700 books as well as his own collection of papers, articles and archival material.
Both the library and archive will continue to be in the care of DMBC Museum Service.

Admiral Sir Hugh Pigot (1775 – 29 July 1857) was an officer of the Royal Navy, who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812.
Biography
Early life and career
He was born the illegitimate son of George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot (1719–1777), and Catherine Hill, and was thus a nephew of Lieutenant-General Robert Pigot and Admiral Hugh Pigot, and a cousin of General Henry Pigot and the notorious Captain Hugh Pigot.

In 1792 he sailed for the Mediterranean aboard the 50-gun , flagship of Rear-Admiral Samuel Granston Goodall, who he followed into the 98-gun ship in May 1793.
Following the evacuation of Toulon in December 1793, he was appointed acting-lieutenant of the 74-gun , Captain Andrew Sutherland (mariner), then served for a short period as midshipman in the Princess Royal, and in the 100-gun , flagship of Admiral William Hotham. He was officially promoted to lieutenant on 12 November 1794 to serve aboard the sloop , under the Captains the Honourable Henry Hotham, Shuldham Peard, and Edwards. His next appointments were to the , Captain John Pakenham; the frigate , under Captains Ralph Willett Miller and Edward Hamilton; the 74-gun , flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Richard Onslow; and the , Captain John William Spranger. In those ships he served in the Mediterranean, Newfoundland, the North Sea, Baltic, and Jamaica stations.

He commanded the 74-gun and then the frigate , on the same station, and commanded the blockading squadron off Guadeloupe at the start of 1809 in the latter ship. On 10 February 1809, Latona assisted in the capture of French frigate Junon, of 46 guns and 323 men, whose fire wounded six of Latonas crew. The exertions and activity Pigot displayed in erecting jury-masts, and putting the prize into a seaworthy state, gained him the warm official thanks of the senior officer present, Captain George Scott, of the Horatio. On 17 April 1809 Pigot witnessed (and was much praised for his spirited exertions during the chase which preceded) the surrender of the French 74-gun ship ; and on 18 June in the same year took part in the capture of the , pierced for 42 guns, but having only 14 of her main-deck armament mounted, with a complement of 174 men, and a cargo of sugar, coffee, etc.
Pigot then moved into the frigate , in which he spent the next four years stationed in the West Indies and at Halifax. In her, during the War of 1812 against the United States, he destroyed the 8-gun letter of marque Wampoe on 28 April 1813, and the 20-gun privateer Holkar on 11 May 1813. On 20 April 1814 he captured the , of twenty 32-pounder carronades, two long 18-pounder guns, and 171 men.

William Masselos (August 11, 1920October 23, 1992) was an American classical pianist.
Biography
William Masselos was born in Niagara Falls, New York to a Dutch mother and a Greek father. He made his New York debut at The Town Hall in 1938 at the age of 18.
He studied with Carl Friedberg, a disciple of Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann, and also with Nelly Reuschel (another Clara Schumann disciple) at New York's Institute of Musical Art (later called Juilliard School).
In 1952, at the age of 32, Masselos played the Brahms Piano Concerto in D minor in his first appearance with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Dimitri Mitropoulos. This impressive debut was the first in a long line of appearances with major orchestras which also included the New York Philharmonic under Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, the Montreal Symphony under Otto Klemperer, the London Philharmonic under Bernard Haitink, the American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy, and numerous others.
Known as a champion of contemporary music, Masselos premiered many works including the Charles Ives Piano Sonata No. 1, the Piano Fantasy by Aaron Copland, and most of the piano literature by Ben Weber, including the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra and the Fantasy (Variations), Op. 25. He was the soloist in the first performances of piano concertos by Alan Hovhaness, Johan Franco, Marga Richter, Carlos Surinach, and William Mayer, in addition to solo pieces by John Cage, Dane Rudhyar, Robert Helps, Carlos Chávez, and many others.
As an heir, through Carl Friedberg, of the Schumann and Brahms tradition, he was also particularly noted for his interpretation of the Schumann Davidsbundlertanze, Op. 6, and the Brahms Sonatas, both of which he recorded for RCA Red Seal in the early 1970s and are highly esteemed by record collectors.
Masselos died in New York City in October 1992, aged 72.
In May 2011, the pianist Lori Sims played a concert of works associated with Masselos at the Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, New York.

Northall is a hamlet in the civil parish of Edlesborough, in Buckinghamshire, England, situated halfway between Edlesborough and Billington, Bedfordshire. It has one large Baptist chapel which is still in use and one pub, The Swan.
The village was formerly part of the Ashridge Estate of the Earls and Dukes of Bridgwater. Like nearby Slapton, it has a few very high gabled cottages, with thickly latticed window panes, which are indicative of having been designed by the architect retained by the estate in the 19th century. The hamlet contains some recently built houses, but most houses are predominantly 19th century. A 16th century inn, The Village Green, was recently converted to a private house.

Semic Comics is one of the leading comic book publishers in France, also known as Semic S.A. Along with French comics, formerly the company published the official translations of products produced by DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Today, Semic publishes translations from others American publishers Avatar Press, Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics, and Top Cow Productions, among others.
History
Editions Lug
In 1950, writer/editor Marcel Navarro and Auguste Vistel founded Editions Lug. At first, the company only reprinted old French and Italian comics. But soon, Navarro decided that his company needed some original characters. He enlisted a number of French and Italian studios to create new series. Although many of them invoked characters featured in American comics, they had enough differences to make them unique.
In 1969, Editions Lug began publishing licensed translations of Marvel Comics in a magazine called Fantask. That year also saw the creation of Wampus. But French censorship forced Editions Lug to cancel both of these magazines after six issues.
In the next two decades, Editions Lug continued to expand, thanks to its growing program of French editions of Marvel Comics, which began to include Conan the Barbarian. Many new magazines and series were added to their French line. A shared universe began to emerge, although not nearly as tightly integrated as the Marvel Universe.
In the mid-1980s, Auguste Vistel died. Eventually, Marcel Navarro chose to retire. The company was sold to the Semic Group, a Scandinavian comic book publisher.
Semic Group / Semic S.A.
After Navarro's departure, the Semic Group continued to publish French editions of Marvel Comics, but discontinued the creation of original material. The half-dozen original Lug titles that remained became reprints-only.
During the late 1990s, the Semic Group transferred all of its French business to Tournon, their French distributors. Tournon soon broke up from the Semic Group and created their own company, Semic S.A.
In early 2004, after Semic had discontinued a line of comic books, a multinational group of writers and artists formed Hexagon Comics and reclaimed the rights to the characters they had created for Éditions Lug.

Chris Goggans, who used the name Erik Bloodaxe in honor of the Viking king Eric I of Norway, is an American hacker, founding member of the Legion of Doom group, and a former editor of Phrack magazine. Loyd Blankenship, aka The Mentor, described Goggans/Bloodaxe as "the best hacker I ever met".
Security career
Around 1990-1991 Goggans and some other Legion members set up a computer security firm, Comsec, which went out of business by 1992. He later became a senior network security engineer for WheelGroup, a network security group.
In closing remarks at a 1995 conference, Goggans remarked that the global hacker community was disorganized and uncoordinated, suggesting that they focus an attack on some foreign country, such as France.
According to Michelle Slatella and Joshua Quittner in their 1995 book Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace, Goggans was in the process of establishing his own computer security company in Texas in 1990. They claim he planned to recruit companies as clients by hacking them and showing how vulnerable their systems were to other hackers.
, Goggans is an internationally recognized expert on information security. He has performed network security assessments for some of the world's largest corporations, including all facets of critical infrastructure, with work spanning 22 countries across four continents. Chris has worked with US Federal law-enforcement agencies on some of America's most notorious computer crime cases. His work has been referenced in publications such as Time, Newsweek and Computerworld, and on networks such as CNN and CNBC.
He is a frequent lecturer on computer security and has held training seminars in nine countries for clients such as NATO, the United States Department of Defense, and Federal Law Enforcement agencies as well as numerous corporate entities. He has been asked to present at major conferences as COMDEX, CSI, ISACA, INFOWARCON, and the Black Hat Briefings. He has also co-authored numerous books including Implementing Internet Security, Internet Security Professional Reference, Windows NT Security, and The Complete Internet Business Toolkit.
During the summer of 2003, Goggans was invited to become an associate professor at the University of Tokyo's Center for Collaborative Research. During the winter of 2008, Chris Goggans was in India for the ClubHack hacker convention.
Currently, Goggans is president of SDI, Inc., a Virginia-based corporation providing information security consulting.
Issues with law enforcement
Goggans was raided by the US Secret Service on March 1, 1990, but was not charged.
In a 1994 interview he claimed he had never engaged in malicious hacking, explaining:
Malicious hacking pretty much stands against everything that I adhere to. You always hear people talking about this so called hacker ethic and I really do believe that. I would never wipe anything out. I would never take a system down and delete anything off of a system. Any time I was ever in a system, I'd look around the system, I'd see how the system was architectured, see how the directory structures differed from different types of other operating systems, make notes about this command being similar to that command on a different type of system, so it made it easier for me to learn that operating system.
"Sure, I was in The Legion of Doom. I have been in everybody's system. But I have never been arrested. I have never broken anything, I have never done anything really, really, criminally bad.”
However, in a phone call intercepted by the Australian Federal Police as part of an investigation into Australian hacker Phoenix (Nahshon Even-Chaim) Goggans was heard planning a raid in which the pair would steal source code and developmental software from Execucom, an Austin, Texas, software and technology company, and sell it to the company's rivals.
In the call, recorded on February 22, 1990 and later presented in the County Court of Victoria as evidence against Even-Chaim, Goggans and Even-Chaim canvassed how much money they could make from such a venture and how they would split fees from Execucom's competitors. During the call Goggans provided Even-Chaim with a number of dial-up access numbers to Execom's computers, commenting: "There are serious things I want to do at that place", and "There's stuff that needs to happen to Execucom.". While there is no evidence that Goggans and Even-Chaim acted on this discussion, Goggans' statement of his intentions calls into question the nobility of his hacking ethics.

Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP) defines the movement of information from receiver to the sender and resembles the User Datagram Protocol in the Internet protocol suite.
The Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP), a protocol in WAP architecture, covers the Transport Layer Protocols in the Internet model. As a general transport service, WDP offers to the upper layers an invisible interface independent of the underlying network technology used. In consequence of the interface common to transport protocols, the upper layer protocols of the WAP architecture can operate independently of the underlying wireless network. By letting only the transport layer deal with physical network-dependent issues, global interoperability can be acquired using mediating gateways.

Teenage Fanclub have had a succession of drummers, namely Francis Macdonald, Brendan O'Hare and Paul Quinn. Keyboardist Finlay Macdonald (no relation) has also been a member. As of April 2021, the band have released eleven studio albums and two compilation albums.
History
Teenage Fanclub emerged from the Glasgow C86 scene. They formed in Bellshill in 1989 following the break-up of The Boy Hairdressers, a band featuring Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake, and Francis Macdonald. Following a brief period in which Blake was a member of BMX Bandits, the three former bandmates joined with Gerard Love to form Teenage Fanclub.
Originally a noisy and chaotic band, their first album A Catholic Education, released in 1990 on Paperhouse, is largely atypical of their later sound, with the possible exception of Everything Flows. Mostly written by Blake and McGinley, the record included several songs originally intended for The Boy Hairdressers. After recording his drum parts, Macdonald left the band to resume his university studies. They re-recorded several songs with Macdonald's replacement,
Brendan O'Hare, because they weren't satisfied with the results of the original recording sessions, and because they wanted to involve O'Hare in the album.
The band followed the album with the EP God Knows It's True before being signed by Creation Records. The King, their next album, was a semi-improvised collection recorded in a single day. Originally intended to be a very limited release, the record received critical reviews of its self-confessed shambolic guitar thrashes and a cover of Madonna's "Like a Virgin".
Their next album, Bandwagonesque, released on Creation Records in the UK and Geffen in the US, brought Teenage Fanclub a measure of commercial success. Bandwagonesque was more deliberately constructed, the hooks became stronger, the guitar riffs were brought under control, and the harmony vocals took shape. Bandwagonesque topped Spin magazine's 1991 end-of-year poll for best album, beating Nirvana's Nevermind, their Creation stablemates My Bloody Valentine's album Loveless, and R.E.M.'s Out of Time.
The subsequent, Thirteen, received mixed reviews on release. Brendan O'Hare left Teenage Fanclub during this period because of "musical differences", to be replaced by Paul Quinn (formerly of the Soup Dragons).
Grand Prix, Teenage Fanclub's fifth album, was both a critical and commercial success in the UK, becoming their first top ten album. In the United States however the band failed to regain the ground that Thirteen had lost them. Around this time Liam Gallagher of labelmates Oasis called the band "the second best band in the world" – second only to Oasis.
Songs from Northern Britain followed Grand Prix and built on the former's success. It became their highest-charting release in the UK and contained their biggest hit single to date, "Ain't That Enough".
The follow-up album, Howdy!, released on Columbia Records in the UK after the demise of Creation, continued the sound of Songs from Northern Britain. Francis Macdonald rejoined as the drummer in place of Quinn, who left the band after recording his parts for Howdy! and before its release in order to focus on his family. Quinn went on to form The Primary 5.
In 2002, they released Words of Wisdom and Hope with Jad Fair of Half Japanese.
Their final release on a Sony label, Four A Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds – A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub, collected the Fanclub's best songs along with three new songs (one from each member).
Their next album, Man-Made, was released on 2 May 2005, on the band's own PeMa label. Man-Made was recorded in Chicago in 2004, and produced by John McEntire of Tortoise.
In 2006, the band held two special concerts (in London and Glasgow) playing their 1991 album Bandwagonesque in its entirety.
The band began work on their ninth album in August 2008, booking an initial three weeks at Leeders Farm recording studio in Norfolk. The album was called Shadows, the first to involve keyboardist Dave McGowan as a full-time member, and was released on the band's own PeMa label. It became available in Europe, Australasia and Japan on 31 May 2010, and was released by Merge Records in North America on 8 June 2010.
In May 2015, Teenage Fanclub played support for the Foo Fighters at their Old Trafford Cricket Ground gig.
Their tenth album, Here, was released on 9 September 2016.
The story of Teenage Fanclub's early days features in the 2017 documentary Teenage Superstars.
In August 2018 the band issued new versions of their five Creation Records era albums which had been remastered at Abbey Road Studios. To celebrate the reissues, the band also announced Songs from Teenage Fanclub: The Creation Records Years, a four-city UK tour during late October to mid-November in which they would play three nights each in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and London, with each night's setlist covering different periods of the Creation-era discography, and featuring former drummers Brendan O'Hare and Paul Quinn participating, in which both drummers would respectively perform the albums and B-sides they had originally recorded. These gigs would be Gerard Love's last with the group, as he separated from the band due to differences in opinion on their future touring plans, later revealed to be a reluctance to fly frequently around the world for live performances.
After Love's departure, Euros Childs joined the band on keyboards and vocals, with Dave McGowan switching over to bass and vocals. A new album with this line-up, titled Endless Arcade, was recorded in early and late 2019. It was originally planned for release in October 2020 to coincide with a UK and Europe tour the following November and December. However, the tour was rescheduled for April and May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the album's release date would eventually be set for 5 March 2021. The album release date and tour would end up being rescheduled once again, with Endless Arcade coming out on 30 April 2021 and the tour dates postponed to September 2021 and April and May 2022.
Other projects
Norman Blake formed the two-person band Jonny with Euros Childs. In 2012, Blake also formed a Canadian-based supergroup with Joe Pernice and Mike Belitsky called The New Mendicants.
Raymond McGinley joined Dave McGowan's folk group Snowgoose, whose debut album Harmony Springs was released in 2012.
After playing bass on Jonny's 2011 eponymous debut album, Dave McGowan became Belle and Sebastian's touring bassist in 2011, and appeared on their 2015 album Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance. On 3 November 2018, he became an official member of the band.
Gerard Love released his own solo album Electric Cables in 2012 using the alias Lightships. The album also featured instrumental contributions from Dave McGowan and former Teenage Fanclub drummer Brendan O'Hare.
Francis Macdonald released an album of minimalist classical music, Music for String Quartet, Piano & Celeste, in 2015. Macdonald played piano and celeste, with strings by members of the Scottish Ensemble.
Musical style and legacy
Their sound is reminiscent of Californian bands like the Beach Boys and the Byrds, and their seventies counterparts Big Star. Teenage Fanclub are influenced by Big Star and Orange Juice. They performed a cover of Orange Juice's "Rip It Up" with Edwyn Collins. In December 2010, at the ATP Bowlie 2 music festival, they performed as the backing band for Edwyn Collins.
Their musical style has been described as alternative rock, power pop, indie rock, indie pop,noise pop, and jangle pop.
Teenage Fanclub were regularly name-checked in interviews by Kurt Cobain, who described them as "the best band in the world". The band would support Nirvana on tour in the summer of 1992. Juliana Hatfield covered the song "Cells" on her 2012 self-titled album.

Henry County is located in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. Per the 2010 census, the population of Henry County is 203,922. The county seat is McDonough. The county was named for Patrick Henry.
Henry County is part of the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA metropolitan statistical area. The Henry County Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History
Henry County, Georgia was created by the Georgia State Legislature in 1821 from land acquired from the Creek Indian Nation by the First Treaty of Indian Springs. Henry's original land area was much larger than it is today, stretching from near Indian Springs (present-day Indian Springs State Park) in the south to the Chattahoochee River near Sandy Springs in the north; encompassing most present-day Metropolitan Atlanta. Before one year passed the size of the County was diminished through the separation of land areas which, in whole or in part, became present day DeKalb, Fulton, Fayette and Newton Counties. Later divisions resulted in Clayton, Spalding, Rockdale and Butts counties.
In the beginning Henry County was a virgin wilderness, having just been ceded from the Creek Nation. Prior to 1821, the Creeks and a few trappers and traders were the only residents of this area. The Creek Indians left their mark through place names, a few small Indian Mounds scattered around the County and through the arrowheads and broken pottery which can be found throughout Henry County.
Jesse Johnson, son of John Johnson and great-grandfather of U.S. President Lyndon Baines Johnson, was a "first settler" of Henry County. He was a prosperous farmer, the second sheriff (1822–1835), and judge, before he moved to Texas.
In 1995, Henry County was the sixth-fastest-growing county in the United States.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water.
The vast majority of Henry County is located in the Upper Ocmulgee River sub-basin of the Altamaha River basin, with just a very small western corner, west of Hampton, located in the Upper Flint River sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin).

Government and politics
The Henry County Board of Commissioners is responsible for administering county government to residents. Four commissioners are elected by voters in individual districts, while the commission chairman is elected countywide and serves as the county's chief executive. June Wood, the former commission chair, was the first African-American to serve in the position after being elected in a December 2016 run-off election. She left office in December 2020 after losing the re-election. As of December 2020, the following individuals serve the county on the Board of Commissioners:
Prior to 1984, Henry County had a presidential voting pattern typical of any other Solid South county in Georgia, consistently awarding landslide margins to Democrats. In 1920, it was one of three counties in the state (alongside Bleckley and Columbia) to give 100% of the vote to Democratic nominee James M. Cox. The first Republican to win Henry County was Richard Nixon in 1972, doing so with 77.93% of the vote, though it returned to the Democratic column when native Georgian Jimmy Carter won it in 1976 and 1980.
From 1984 to 2004, Henry County was a Republican stronghold, consistent with several Atlanta suburbs, as well as other suburban areas across the country. Strong margins in Henry County and other Atlanta suburbs were vital to Republicans' performance, offsetting strongly Democratic Black voters in Atlanta proper. Republican dominance peaked in 1988, when George H.W. Bush won 71.11% of the vote to Michael Dukakis' 28.41%, a 42.7% margin of victory. During this time, no Democrat managed even 40 percent of the county's vote.
However, an increasing minority population and a growing Democratic trend among suburban voters has derailed the former Republican dominance. While Democrat Barack Obama failed to win the county in either of his two national victories, his margins of defeat were only in the single digits (a 7.44% loss in 2008 against John McCain and 3.29% in 2012 against Mitt Romney), thanks in part to explosive population growth that brought an influx of Democratic-leaning minority voters into the county. In the 2000 Census, the racial makeup of the county was 81.38% white and 14.68% African American. The Black population shot up to 36.9% in 2010, and the white population fell to a mere 55.0%. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the Black population outnumbered the white population, 47.88% to 45.58%. As a consequence, in 2016, the county swung into the Democratic column, voting for Hillary Clinton by a 4.36 percentage point margin of victory for the first time in 36 years in spite of the rightward shift taken by the rest of the country. This trend remained in 2018 when it voted for Democrat Stacey Abrams for governor by a margin of 15.34% against Republican then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp. In 2020, it swung 16.11 points deeper into the Democratic column, the largest Democratic swing of any county in the country, culminating in Joe Biden winning the county by 20.47 percentage points as he carried Georgia. In doing so, Biden turned in the best showing for a non-Georgian Democrat in the county since John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Douglas Robinson Sr. (March 24, 1824 – November 30, 1893) was a Scottish-American banker and businessman who was prominent in New York society during the Gilded Age. He was married to Fanny Monroe, the daughter of U.S. Representative James Monroe and grandniece of James Monroe, the 5th President of the United States. Their son, Douglas Robinson Jr., was married to Corinne Roosevelt, sister of President Theodore Roosevelt and aunt of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
Early life
Robinson was born on March 24, 1824, in Scotland and was descended from Scottish landed gentry. He was the youngest of four sons born to William Rose Robinson of Clermiston (1781–1834) and Mary (née Douglas) Robinson (1783–1864). He was the younger brother of Sir William Rose Robinson, KCSI, who served as acting Governor of Madras. His sister,
Saida Douglas Robinson, was married to Alexander Davidson.
His paternal grandparents were George Robinson and Elizabeth (née Innes) Robinson. His maternal grandparents were James Douglas of Orchardton, a Glasgow merchant, and Elizabeth (née Douglas) Douglas. His maternal uncle was William Douglas, a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons, and his great-uncle was Sir William Douglas, 1st Baronet, of Gelston Castle, Scotland, both of whom died unmarried with no children. Robinson's maternal grandfather, James Douglas, was the brother of George Douglas, the maternal grandfather of his eventual wife Fanny. According to Marian Campbell Gouverneur (daughter-in-law of Samuel L. Gouverneur, himself a nephew and son-in-law of President Monroe), "George Douglas was a Scotch merchant who hoarded closely. His wine cellar was more extensive than his library."
Career
After studying at Edinburgh University, eighteen year old Robinson emigrated from Scotland to the United States in 1842. He started in business in Philadelphia and later came to New York as a partner in the banking house of James K. Soutter's Sons. He later served as secretary of the Great Western Insurance Company, which was then known as the United States Lloyds.
Society life
In 1892, Robinson, as well as his son Douglas and daughter-in-law Corinne, was included in Ward McAllister's "Four A Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.
The Robinson's had a country home in the Catskills, in the style of a Scottish Castle, in Jordanville, New York that was known as Henderson House and modeled after Sir William Douglas' Gelston Castle in Scotland. Henderson House was a 5,000-acre plot of a 15,000-acre grant from Queen Anne to Fanny's 2x great-grandfather, James Henderson. Fanny had inherited the home from her aunt Harriet (née Douglas) Cruger, the sister of her mother, Elizabeth Douglas Monroe. Cruger was an eccentric lady known for her many friendships with prominent people of her time, including Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, William Wordsworth, Juliette Récamier, and Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette.
Around 1872, the Robinson's came to West Orange, New Jersey and built a large home next door to General George McClellan. Their 72-acre estate was known as Overlook. As with his other properties, his son inherited Overlook upon his death in 1893.
Personal life
On November 14, 1850, Robinson was married to his second cousin Frances "Fanny" Monroe (1824–1906), the daughter of Elizabeth Mary "Eliza" (née Douglas) Monroe and Col. James Monroe, a Virginian born member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York who was the nephew of James Monroe, the 5th President of the United States. They were married at Fanwood in Fort Washington, which was then a suburb of New York. Together, they were the parents of two children:
Douglas Robinson Jr. (1855–1918), who married Corinne Roosevelt (1861–1933), the youngest child of Theodore Roosevelt Sr. and Martha (née Bulloch) Roosevelt. She was also the younger sister of Bamie Roosevelt, President Theodore Roosevelt, and Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt (therefore the aunt of future First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt).
Harriet Douglas "Missy" Robinson (1856–1922), who married the Rev. Henry Bazeley Wolryche-Whitmore (1856–1928), an Englishman who was the nephew and heir of William Wolryche-Whitmore, a Member of Parliament who represented Bridgnorth and Wolverhampton.
Robinson died on November 30, 1893, aboard the , a Lloyd passenger steamer, while sailing from New York. He was buried at the Robinson Cemetery in Herkimer County, New York. His widow died in Warren, New York in August 1906. In 1908, the Robinson children erected the Jordanville Public Library, designed by New York architects Trowbridge & Livingston, as a memorial to their parents in Jordanville, New York.
Descendants
Through his son Douglas Jr., he was a grandfather of Theodore Douglas Robinson (1883–1934), a member of the New York State Senate who married his distant cousin, Helen Rebecca Roosevelt, daughter of James Roosevelt Roosevelt and Helen Schermerhorn Astor (a niece of Franklin D. Roosevelt); Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886–1971), a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives who married Joseph Wright Alsop IV; Monroe Douglas Robinson (1887–1944), who married Dorothy Jordan, the granddaughter of Eben Dyer Jordan; and Stewart Douglas Robinson (1889–1909), who tragically died from a fall while a student at Harvard University.
Through his daughter Harriet, he was a grandfather of Frances Sylvia Wolryche-Whitmore (1889–1939), who married the Rev. William Higgin Beauchamp Yerburgh (1885–1937) in 1925; and Ursula Margaret Wolryche-Whitmore, who in 1934 married Sir Oswald Arthur Scott, K.C.M.G. (1893–1960), the U.K. Minister to Finland between 1947 and 1951 and U.K. Ambassador to Peru from 1951 to 1953.

OHSAS 18001, Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, was an international standard for occupational health and safety management systems that was subsequently adopted as a British Standard. Compliance with it enabled organizations to demonstrate that they had a system in place for occupational health and safety. BSI cancelled OHSAS 18001 to adopt ISO 45001. ISO 45001 was published in March 2018 by the International Organization for Standardization. Organizations that are certified to OHSAS 18001 were able to migrate to ISO 45001 by March 2021 to retain a recognized certification.
Origins
Organizations worldwide recognize the need to control and improve health and safety performance and do so with occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS). However, before 1999 there was an increase of national standards and proprietary certification schemes to choose from. This caused confusion and fragmentation in the market and undermined the credibility of individual schemes.
Development
Recognising this deficit, an international collaboration called the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) Project Group was formed to create a single unified approach. The Group comprised representatives from national standards bodies, academic bodies, accreditation bodies, certification bodies and occupational safety and health institutions, with the UK's national standards body, BSI Group, providing the secretariat. Drawing on the best of existing standards and schemes, the OHSAS Project Group published the OHSAS 18000 Series in 1999. The Series consisted of two specifications: 18001 provided requirements for an OHS management system and 18002 gave implementation guidelines.
Adoption as British Standard
BSI Group decided to adopt OHSAS 18001 (OHSMS) and OHSAS 18002 (guidance specification) as British standards.
OHSAS 18001 was updated in July 2007 in particular to better reflect ILO-OSH guidelines and additionally, the "health" component of "health and safety" was given greater emphasis.
Since the publication of the International Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems ISO 45001, BSI canceled its OHSAS 18001 standards and adopted the ISO standard.
Disambiguation
The OHSAS 18000 standards were written and published wholly outside of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) framework. To avoid confusion, ISO 18000 does exist – but it is a radio-frequency identification standard.

The Treaty of Vienna, concluded on 27 May 1657, was an Austro–Polish alliance during the Second Northern War. After Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III had agreed to
enter the war on the anti-Swedish side and support the Polish king John II Casimir with 4,000 troops in the ineffective Treaty of Vienna (1656), his death in April 1657 made way for a more substantial treaty with his successor Leopold I. By this treaty, Leopold I promised to aid John II Casimir with 12,000 troops against the Swedish-Brandenburgian alliance. These troops were to be maintained at Polish expense, and crossed the Polish border in June.

Burke County is a county located along the eastern border of the U.S. state of Georgia in the Piedmont. As of the 2010 census, the population was 23,316. The county seat is Waynesboro.
Burke County is part of the Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC Metropolitan Statistical Area.
History
Burke County is an original county of Georgia, created February 5, 1777, and named for English political writer, Edmund Burke, a Member of Parliament in the Whig Party who favored conciliation with the colonies. In 1779, Col. John Twiggs and brothers Col. William Few and Benjamin Few, along with 250 men, defeated British in the Battle of Burke Jail.
Burke County is located within the CSRA (the Central Savannah River Area). During the antebellum period, it was developed by slave labor for large cotton plantations. The county was majority African American in population in this period, as slaveholders wanted high numbers of slaves for laborers to cultivate and process cotton.
The military tradition continued during the American Civil War, when Burke County provided volunteers for numerous units: the 2nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company D (Burke Sharpshooters), 3rd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company A (Burke Guards), 32nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company C (Williams Volunteers), 32nd Regiment Georgia Infantry Company K (Alexander Greys), 48th Regiment Georgia Infantry Company D (Burke Volunteers), Cobb's Legion Infantry company E (Poythress Volunteers), and the Cobb's Legion Cavalry Company F (Grubb's Hussars).
Agriculture continued as the basis of the economy for decades after the American Civil War, when most freedmen worked as sharecroppers or tenant farmers. Cotton was the major commodity crop. In the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture caused many African-American farmworkers to lose their jobs.
As can be seen from the census tables below, the county lost population from 1910 to 1920, and from 1930 to 1970. Part of the decline was related to the Great Migration, as millions of African Americans left the rural South and Jim Crow oppression for jobs and opportunities in industrial cities of the Midwest, North. From World War II on, primary migration destinations were West Coast cities because of the buildup of the defense industry. In addition, whites left rural areas for industrial jobs in the North, in cities such as Chicago and Detroit.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.0%) is water. It is the second-largest county by area in Georgia.
The southern half of Burke County, defined by a line running along State Route 80 to Waynesboro, then southeast to east of Perkins, is located in the Upper Ogeechee River sub-basin of the Ogeechee River basin. North of Waynesboro, and bordered on the north by a line running from Keysville southeast to Girard, the territory is part of the Brier Creek sub-basin of the Savannah River basin. The most northern sliver of Burke County is located in the Middle Savannah River sub-basin of the same Savannah River basin.

In algebraic geometry, a logarithmic pair consists of a variety, together with a divisor along which one allows mild logarithmic singularities. They were studied by .
Definition
A boundary Q-divisor on a variety is a Q-divisor D of the form ΣdiDi where the Di are the distinct irreducible components of D and all coefficients are rational numbers with 0≤di≤1.
A logarithmic pair, or log pair for short, is a pair (X,D) consisting of a normal variety X and a boundary Q-divisor D.
The log canonical divisor of a log pair (X,D) is K+D where K is the canonical divisor of X.
A logarithmic 1-form on a log pair (X,D) is allowed to have logarithmic singularities of the form
d log(z) = dz/z along components of the divisor given locally by z=0.

The Feast of All Saints of Russia, also known as The Feast Day of All Russian Saints Resplendent in the Russian land (), is a day of remembrance celebrated in the Russian Orthodox Church on the second Sunday after Pentecost. It is dedicated to all Russian Orthodox saints: those who are canonized, and those whose deeds are unknown.
History
Origins
The monk Dositheus Toporkov, nephew of Joseph of Volokolamsk, was working on a revision of the Sinai Patericon in 1528–1529 with the blessing of Archbishop Macarius of Novgorod (later Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus). He wrote in an afterword that although Russia had holy men and women as worthy of veneration as the eastern saints of early Christianity, "because of our negligence, [they are] left without proper attention and are not recorded in the written works, some [of them] we ourselves know" (11, 74, 12, 275).
Macarius is noted for collecting and systematizing Orthodox Russia's hagiographic, hymnal and homiletic heritage. He and his assistants worked from 1529 to 1541 on the Great Menaion Reader (), a twelve-volume work detailing the lives of many Russian saints who were regionally revered but not generally recognized by the church. The reader, compiled on a calendar basis with biographies of many Russian ascetics, accelerated the process of venerating many Russian Orthodox saints.
Macarius councils
After becoming Metropolitan of all Rus' in 1542, Macarius convened councils in Moscow in 1547 and 1549 to consider the glorification of Russian saints. Thirty (or thirty-one) church-wide saints and nine locally-venerated saints were canonized at the councils. The issue of future canonization was also resolved, with veneration now subject to the church's collective judgment.
Church-wide saints glorified by the 1547 council include:
Jonah, Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia (died 1461)
John, Archbishop of Novgorod (died 1186)
Macarius of Kalyazin (died 1483)
Paphnutius of Borovsk (died 1477)
Alexander Nevsky (died 1263)
Nikon of Radonezh (died 1426)
Paul of Komel and Obnora (died 1429)
Michael of Klopsk (died 1456)
Sabbas of Storozhi (died 1406)
Zosimas (died 1478) and
Sabbatius of Solovki (died 1435) of Solovki
Dionysius of Glushitsa (died 1437)
Alexander of Svir (died 1533)
Saints identified for local veneration by the council include:
Blessed Maximus of Moscow (died 1434)
Constantine of Murom and his children, Michael and Theodore (died 1129)
Peter and Fevronia of Murom (died 1228)
Arsenius of Tver (died 1409)
Blessed Procopius (died 1303) and John of Ustyug (died 1494)
Church-wide saints glorified by the 1549 council reportedly include:
Niphon, Archbishop of Novgorod (died 1156)
Jonah (died 1470) and Euthymius (died 1458) of Novgorod
James, Bishop of Rostov (died 1392)
Stephen of Perm (died 1396)
Vsevolod of Pskov (died 1138)
Michael of Tver (died 1318)
Abraham of Smolensk (died 1222)
John, Eustace, and Anthony of Lithuania (died 1347)
Euthymius of Suzdal (died 1404)
Gregory of Pelshema (died 1442)
Sabbas of Vishera (died 1460)
Euphrosyne of Pskov (died 1481)
Ephraim of Perekom (died 1492)
Abraham of Bulgaria (died 1229)
Arsenius of Serbia (died 1266)
The 1547 council also established a day of remembrance for "new Russian miracle workers".
After the councils
The Feast of All Saints of Russia was originally on July 17, near the commemoration of Vladimir the Great (July 15), but has changed several times. A feast for all Russian saints required a service, which was written by the monk Gregory of St. Euthymius monastery in Suzdal. Although Gregory's service was widely used in the 16th century, it was not published until the first half of the 18th century.
Neglect
By the end of the 16th century, the feast was celebrated only in certain parts of Russia. This trend increased during the 17th century and the synodal period, and the feast was eventually preserved only by the Old Believers.
Nikolai Osipovich Gazukin, a peasant who lived in Sudogda, Vladimir Governorate, petitioned the Most Holy Synod on July 20, 1908 to establish an annual celebration of all Russian saints. Gazukin's request was denied because the synod believed that the existing feast of All Saints included all Russian saints.
1918 resumption
Petrograd University professor Boris Turaev and hieromonk Athanasius Sakharov wanted to restore the feast. Both were members of the 1917–18 Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church. On March 15, 1918, Turaev appeared at a meeting to report his request to restore the feast. On August 20, 1918, Turaev's report was reviewed by the council on August 20 of that year and, on August 26, restored the feast; it would be celebrated on the first Sunday of Peter's Fast.
The council ruled that a revised, expanded version of Gregory's service should be published. Turaev and Athanasius determined that only a small part of the monk's service was still usable. New hymns were primarily composed by Turaev, and Athanasius selected prayers from services of Russian saints. On September 8, 1918, a partial new service was reviewed and approved by the Patriarch and the Holy Synod.
Soviet era
On November 18, 1918, after the close of the local council, Patriarch Tikhon and the Holy Synod blessed the new service under the supervision of metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky of Vladimir. Diocesan bishops were sent a December 13 decree restoring the feast and, on June 16, 1919, were sent a printed service to be used on the first Sunday after receipt. Turaev (who wanted to improve the hastily-composed service) died on July 23, 1920, and Athanasius, who became an archimandrite in 1920 and a bishop in 1921, felt unable to complete the task alone.
During his first imprisonment in fall 1922 in Vladimir prison, Bishop Athanasius met with 11 like-minded admirers of the restored holiday; they included Archbishop Nicander (Fenomenov) of Krutitsy, Archbishop Thaddeus (Uspensky) of Astrakhan, Bishop Cornelius (Sobolev) of Vyazniki, and Bishop Basil (Summer) of Suzdal. A revision of the 1918 service was agreed on, and the date of the feast became flexible. Hymns were changed, and new saints were added to the service. On November 10, 1922, the service was celebrated in the prison for the first time.
In solitary confinement at Taganka Prison, Bishop Athanasius consecrated the hidden antimins in honor of all Russian saints for his secret church on March 1, 1923. He decided that the service needed to be supplemented further and a second feast day designated: July 29, the day after the feast of Vladimir the Great.
The service was published by the Moscow Patriarchate in 1946, and the feast began to be widely celebrated. Bishop Athanasius, author of most of its chants, continued to work on the service until his death in 1962.

Lyrics and music
The first section of lyrics deal about Zumbi in Portuguese and then tribe in relation to life and god. The last section lists different tribes in alphabetical order, including Aboriginal, Hopi, Māori, and Mohican.
The first minute of this six-minute song plays a berimbau with a man singing a traditional song in Portuguese about Zumbi and his quilombo Palmares's resistance to the Portuguese. Tin can-sounded drums would start before going into churning metal riffs containing power chords, with drums performed during the rest and then played over the riff. Tribal part is played during the last quarter of the song before ending with the same rhythm in metal.

Bryan County is a county located in the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 30,233. The county seat is Pembroke.
Bryan County is part of the Savannah, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The Bryan County Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History
Bryan County was created on December 19, 1793, named after Jonathan Bryan (1708–1788), an American Revolutionary War partisan.
South Bryan County is home to the earthen Civil War installation Fort McAllister (now Fort McAllister Historic Park) which Gen. William Sherman captured on his March to the Sea.
The colonial town of Hardwick, laid out in 1755, served as the initial county seat. In 1797, the Georgia General Assembly moved the county seat to Cross Roads near modern Richmond Hil. On November 18, 1814, the county seat was moved to Mansford on the Canoochee River. In 1860, the seat was known as Eden. By the 1880s the county seat was known as Bryan. By 1895 it was in Clyde, which may have been the same location formerly known as Eden and Mansford. Clyde served as the seat to 1935; in 1937 Pembroke took on that role. The only remaining sign of Clyde is a cemetery on the Fort Stewart military reservation.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.1%) is water.
A triangular area in the northeast of Bryan County, from northwest of Pembroke to north of Richmond Hill, is located in the Lower Ogeechee River sub-basin of the Ogeechee River basin, as is the northern half of the remaining area in the county south of Richmond Hill. The northwestern portion of the county, from east of Daisy to Richmond Hill, is located in the Canoochee River sub-basin of the Ogeechee River basin. The rest of Bryan County is located in the Ogeechee Coastal sub-basin of the same Ogeechee River basin.
Bryan County is unique in that it is totally divided by the military installation at Ft. Stewart. Pembroke is in more rural north Bryan, while Richmond Hill in south Bryan County is a suburb of Savannah. To travel between the two on public roads, it is necessary to leave the county.

Leigh Park is a large suburb (population 27,500) of Havant, in Hampshire, England. It currently forms the bulk or whole of four electoral wards: Battins, Bondfields, Barncroft and Warren Park (generally referred to as 'The Warren').
Staunton Country Park lies on the northern edge of Leigh Park, also within the Havant boundary.
History
Leigh Park existed before becoming a post Second world war housing estate,
Early history
As early as 1750 mention was made of a farm on the site in a will of that year and local historians consider it likely that a farm existed there around 100 years earlier.
Leigh park estate
Leigh Park Estate may have been formed with the building of Leigh House by the then owner Samuel Harrison some time before 1791. The stables, walled garden and coach house of the house survived as part of Staunton Country Park. The estate encompassed decorative planting, lakes and follies and was described as "one of the most beautiful spots in the county" in 1826.
In 'The Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales' Leigh is described as a tything of Havant parish two miles to the north west of Havant with a population of 547.
Second world war
Leigh Park was re-developed as a new suburb for those made homeless in Portsmouth by bomb damage which occurred during World War II and to enable the new roads and parks of Portsmouth to be built.
Post war
The land for the estate was purchased by Portsmouth City council from the Fitzwygram family in 1944; work started on building in 1947 and the first residents moved in during 1949. The first shops opened in 1952 (in Stone Square) and the main shopping centre of Park Parade / Greywell Shopping opened in 1955.
The majority of homes in Leigh Park were built by Portsmouth City Council, not Havant Borough Council through a financially underwritten cooperation with the former Havant and Waterloo Urban District Council. Most Leigh Park tenants of social housing pay rent to the properties' owners Guinness Partnership (formerly Hermitage Housing) or Portsmouth City Council which has an office near Park Parade. Residents are liable in council tax to Havant Borough Council who provide local services and collect the Hampshire County Council proportion.
Construction of the estate was not fully completed until the early 1970s, although most of the houses in the area were built by 1960.
Hermitage Housing commissions most new housing in Leigh Park. Barratt Homes is currently building on the former Procter & Gamble site in the centre of Leigh Park. Leigh Park was one of the largest wholly council estates in Europe however following the ongoing right to buy many of the properties are privately owned.
In 2004, Leigh Park made the news when a gang stole more than £100,000 from the Nationwide Building Society and a man sleeping on a bench was set on fire, in a separate incident.
Governance
The suburb of Leigh Park comes under the remit of the local government district and borough of Havant and within the boundary of Hampshire County Council. the area is broadly covered by the electoral wards of Barncroft, Battins and Warren Park while some northern section of Bedhampton ward might be considered within what might be commonly thought of Leigh Park.
Leigh Park is part of the parliamentary constituency of Havant. it is served by MP Alan Mak, a Conservative.
Geography
The modern estate is bordered to the east by the Havant to Petersfield railway line excluding perhaps some industrial units by the railway which would not be considered part of the estate. The Northern extent is approximately defined in line with the A3M and B2150 junction. Staunton Country Park and Leigh Park Gardens may or may not be considered part of the estate, as might the Southleigh House area which lies to the east of the Railway. The western edge is bounded but excluding houses around B2150 road from Old Bedhampton to Waterlooville. To the south, the boundary lies broadly just to the north of the B2149 road.
Leigh Park is broadly flat gradually rising to the North with some sharper rises at fringes around the northern parts.
The Hermitage Stream and tributaries run through parts of Leigh Park while the Lavant stream runs down the left side of the settlement. Both run into Langstone Harbour which is approximately to the south at the nearest point.
Culture and community
There was a Bowling alley beside park parade that was converted to a bingo hall and opened by Diana Dors in 1984.
Transport
The main shopping precinct is served by Stagecoach South bus routes 20, 21, 23, 37 and 39, which provide links with central Havant (with some services continuing to Portsmouth and the main area hospital). First Hampshire & Dorset operates the 27 service through the estate between Rowlands Castle, Havant and Emsworth.
Havant railway station is the nearest major train station, smaller stations Bedhampton and Rowlands Castle are near parts of Leigh Park. The A3(M) motorway and A27 Havant bypass are the areas' major links to the rest of the country,
Education
Leigh Park contains several primary schools: Front Lawn, Trosnant, Riders, Sharps Copse, Park House, Warren Park, Barncroft School and St Albans C of E.
Leigh Park is currently served by three secondary schools: Havant Academy (known as Wakefords Secondary School when it opened in 1970 and latterly Staunton Community Sports College until 2009), Park Community School (known previously as Broomfield Secondary School, when it opened in 1958, and Broomfield Comprehensive School until 1988) and Prospect School, built in 2008, an education centre for children with learning and social disabilities.
The West Leigh area was also served by Oak Park Secondary School on Leigh Road (close to the junction with Crosland Drive - now demolished), from its opening in 1957 to its closure in the late 1980s. Pupils from that area then attended Warblington Comprehensive School situated some distance from the area on Southleigh Road, Denvilles.
Between 1958 and 1960 Havant Grammar School had shared the Broomfield Secondary School site on Middle Park Way until it moved to its own, new buildings on the corner of Barncroft Way and New Road. The title Havant Grammar School disappeared with the arrival of the comprehensive school system and it became Havant College a sixth-form college in 1974.
Sport
The suburb's main non-league football side is Havant & Waterlooville who currently play in the Conference South, two divisions below the Football League. The team's main claim to fame is reaching the FA Cup fourth round in the 2007-08 season when they twice took the lead against Liverpool at Anfield before finally losing 5-2.
Havant Hockey Club play at Havant College on Barncroft Way (just on the outskirts of Leigh Park). The team were National and European Champions in the 1990s. The street High Lawn Way just beyond the Crown Bingo Hall also offshoots onto a bowls club, two tennis courts and a common playing fields and children's play area.
Leigh Park boxing club is based at the community centre.

Enrique Arsenio Lucca Quiñones (born April 10, 1946) better known as Papo Lucca, is a Puerto Rican multi-instrumentalist best known for his pianist skills. His main musical genres are Salsa and Latin Jazz. He ranks with the late Charlie Palmieri, as one of the best piano instrumentalists in Latin Jazz and Salsa. He is the co-founder with his father Don Enrique "Quique" Lucca Caraballo of the Puerto Rican band La Sonora Ponceña. He has also played and recorded with the Fania All-Stars, Hector Lavoe, Willie Colón, Celia Cruz, Johnny Pacheco, Bobby Valentín, Ismael Quintana, Gloria Estefan, Adalberto Santiago, Andy Montañez, Pablo Milanés, and Rubén Blades. He is also a well-known music arranger.
Biography
Lucca Quiñones was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on 10 April 1946. His father was Enrique Quique Lucca.
Papo Lucca is married to Mirriam and they have children. In June 2020, their eldest son died of complications due to diabetes.
Career
With his dynamic piano playing and unique approach to salsa, Papo Lucca has led his band, La Sonora Ponceña, to the forefront of Latin music. Inheriting the group from his father, Lucca has continued to inspire La Sonora Ponceña with his innovative playing. While Rubén Blades called Lucca, "the best pianist in the world", Cuban pianist Ruben Gonzalez explained, "of non-Cuban pianists, I most admire [Lucca] because his salsa is very close to son. Son piano is more varied than salsa piano which is more formulaic and holds on to a single riff much longer."
Lucca has been involved with music most of his life. A native of Ponce, a city on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, he began studying at the city's Free School of Music at the age of six. In addition to being trained in solfeggio, he studied piano, clarinet, saxophone, and music theory. A month after he enrolled in the school, he performed a classical piece on a local radio station. Lucca simultaneously studied privately with pianist Ramón Fernández. With his father's encouragement, Lucca advanced quickly. Performing with La Sonora Ponceña at the age of eight, he made his recording debut three years later, when the group accompanied bolero vocalists Felipe Rodriguez and Davilita on their album, Al Compas De Las Sonoras. At the age of fourteen, Lucca began an "official" member of La Sonora Ponceña.
Throughout the 1950s, Lucca remained active as a musician. In addition to playing solo piano on a television show hosted by Ruth Fernández, he recorded with Obdulio Morales, Orquestra Panamerica, and Machito. Despite his busy schedule, Lucca found time to continue his formal studies. Graduating from the University of Puerto Rico, he went on to study at the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music. His first opportunity to showcase his talents came in 1976 when he co-produced La Sonora Ponceña's album, Musical Conquest/Conquista Musical, with Louie Ramirez. Two years later, he produced the group's album, Explorando, on his own. Although he's remained committed to Sonora Ponceña, Lucca has balanced his involvement with a variety of outside projects. In 1976, he replaced pianist Larry Harlow in the Fania All-Stars. He continued to perform with the group until the mid-1990s.
Lucca reached a professional high in 1979. Together with La Sonora Ponceña, he collaborated with influential Latin vocalist Celia Cruz on an album, La Ceiba, and appeared with Cruz in a television documentary, Salsa. The same year, he performed on an album, Habana Jam, along with the Fania All-Stars, which was recorded during a concert in Cuba. Lucca also recorded a solo piano album, Latin Jazz, in 1993.
In 2014, Lucca and La Sonora Ponceña played at Lehman Center for the Performing Arts in New York to commemorate their 60-year anniversary.

Jason Ebeyer (born 4 December 1992) is a 3D artist and art director from Melbourne, Australia. He is known for his highly detailed figures and for pioneering the glossy style of character art which has become his signature.
Early life
Jason Ebeyer was born in 1992 in Melbourne, Australia. He studied at various schools growing up but spent his formative years receiving education at Deniliquin High School in rural NSW. In 2014, Ebeyer returned to Melbourne to study graphic design at university. He attended classes at Tractor School of Design (FKA Grenadi School of Design) in the CBD.
Career
Ebeyer is known for his glossy figures and sensual style of artwork. Of the medium, he commented in an 2021 interview: “ I've worked across lots of different mediums, from traditional illustration and painting, through to photo manipulation and collage and then finally falling into 3D pieces of software. I settled with this medium because it truly enabled me to produce the work and figures that I imagine.”
Ebeyer worked on the 2018 animated video and accompanying artwork for the song “Bloom” by Troye Sivan. Ebeyer created the 3D animated video over a 4-week period in collaboration with Troye.
In 2019, Ebeyer designed and animated the launch campaign for Nikita Dragun's cosmetics company, Dragun Beauty.
In 2020, Ebeyer animated the music video for the Steve Aoki and Icona Pop track "I Love My Friends" which released in March, 2020. Trailing the release of the music video, Jason was approached for a collaborative project with the Tom of Finland Foundation and adult entertainment company, MEN.com. Jason recreated four adult film stars for the collaboration and animated them in surreal and alien worlds. The resulting animations were then spliced into the live action footage and released on 8 May. During this time, Ebeyer was simultaneously working on large works for HUDA Beauty, Kim Petras and two more projects with Nikita Dragun, including the launch campaign for her Morphe collaboration palette. In September 2020, Vogue Italia contacted Jason to participate in a 10-page editorial spread for the coveted September Issue. 2020 also saw Jason sign onto his biggest collaborative project to date. Ebeyer was tasked with the role of creating and developing character concepts and concept artwork for Sensorium Galaxy, an immersive VR platform which is due launch in late 2021. The project has seen Jason conceptualize over 100 characters, each with distinct styles and looks.
In 2021, Jason partnered up with American Photographer, Steven Klein. Together the pair created the March cover for V Magazine featuring a heavily stylized and surreal reimaginaing of rap star, Doja Cat.

Palazzo Barbaran da Porto is a palazzo in Vicenza, Italy designed in 1569 and built between 1570 and 1575 by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio.
Since 1994 the palace is part of the "City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto" World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
In the palace is located the Museo Palladio and the Centro internazionale di studi di architettura Andrea Palladio (CISA).
History
The sumptuous residence realised between 1570 and 1575 for the Vicentine noble Montano Barbarano is the only great city palace that Andrea Palladio succeeded in executing in its entirety.
In his History of Vicenza of 1591, Iacopo Marzari records Montano Barbarano as a man "of belles lettres and most excellent musician". Various flutes figure in the 1592 inventory of the palace, confirming the existence of an intensive musical activity there.
At least three different autograph projects survive, preserved in London, which document alternative hypotheses for the building's plan, all quite different from the actual one and testimony to a complex design process. Barbarano, in fact, requested Palladio to respect the existence of various houses belonging to the family and already existing on the area of the new palace. Moreover, once the project was finalised Barbarano acquired a further house adjoining the property, which resulted in the asymmetrical positioning of the entrance portal. In any case, the constraints imposed by the site and by a practical patron became the occasion for courageous and refined solutions: Palladio's intervention is magisterial, elaborating upon a sophisticated project for "restructuring" which blended the diverse pre-existing structures into a unified edifice.
In 1998, after a twenty-year restoration, the Palace has been opened to the public. The exhibition activities began in March 1999.
Description
On the ground floor, a magnificent four-columned atrium welds together the two pre-existing building lots. In realising the scheme, Palladio was called upon to resolve two problems: one statical, how to support the floor of the great hall on the piano nobile; the other compositional, how to restore a symmetrical appearance to interiors compromised by the oblique course of the perimeter walls from the pre-existing houses.
Departing from the model of the wings of the Theatre of Marcellus in Rome, Palladio divided the interior into three aisles, placing centrally four Ionic columns which allowed the reduction of the span of the central cross-vaults, set against lateral barrel vaults. He thus achieved a very statically efficient framework capable of bearing the floor of the hall above without any difficulty.
The central columns were then tied to the perimeter walls by fragments of rectilinear entablature, which absorb the irregularities of the atrium plan: in this way he realised a sort of system of serliane, a stratagem conceptually similar to that of the Basilica Palladiana loggias. Palladio even adopted the unusual type of Ionic capital (derived from the Temple of Saturn in the Forum Romanum) because it permitted him to mask the slight but significant rotations necessary to align the columns and engaged columns.
Decoration
To decorate the palace, in several campaigns Montano employed some of the greatest artists of his time: Giovanni Battista Zelotti (who had already intervened in the interiors of Palladio's Villa Emo at Fanzolo), Anselmo Canera and Andrea Vicentino; the stuccoes were entrusted to Lorenzo Rubini (who contemporaneously executed the external decorations of the Loggia del Capitanio) and, after his death in 1574, to his son Agostino. The net result was a sumptuous palace capable of rivalling the residences of the Thiene, the Porto and of the Valmarana, a palace which permitted its patron to represent himself to the city as a ranking member of the Vicentine cultural élite.

Folkingham ( ) is an English village and civil parish on the northern edge of the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire. The civil and ecclesiastical parishes cover the same area. Folkingham lies on the A15 road north of Bourne and 10 miles (16 km) south of Sleaford. The 2001 Census gave a population of 729, rising to 796 at the 2011 census, and estimated at 795 in 1919.
Topography & development
This former town is attractively situated in a wide rolling landscape, just up from the fen edge, on the northern incline of an east-west stream valley. The settlement is centred on a large Market Place, positioned between a church on high land to the NW and a former baronial castle on low land to the SE. The modern A15 runs through the market area, rather than bypassing the settlement as at Aslackby and Osbournby, taking a dramatic right-angled turn at its NW corner.
The earliest settlement was probably on the high promontory overlooking stream valleys close to the church. It is likely this was linked to Roman roads (King Street and Mareham Lane) on either side via an east-west route running along what is now West Street and Sleaford Road. The castle site on low lying land to the SE probably evolved from a pre-Conquest fortified enclosure which was the administrative centre of the soke of Folkingham. A market area developed in between the church and castle and this became the site for weekly markets and seven annual fairs.
The Market Place, West Street and Sleaford Road were lined with houses, farms, shops and inns/public houses and this whole area was remodelled in the late 18th century by the Heathcote Family of Normanton (Rutland) who bought the manor in 1788. The most dramatic manifestation of this work was the refacading of The Greyhound Inn at the top of the Market Place. In recognition of its importance, this area became one of the first designated conservation areas in Lincolnshire in 1968.
The town was bypassed by the railway and declined in the Victorian period as the coaching trade collapsed and services and retailing moved to larger towns. The main development since has been the erection of council housing off West Street in the 1950s, followed by the private Churchfields estate behind, built between 1987-97.
The modern village retains a pub, The New Inn on West Street, and a local shop in the Market Place.
Toponymy
Folkingham is an early Saxon place name and appears in the Domesday survey of 1086 as Folchingeham. Its meaning can be interpreted as the 'Homestead belonging to Folc(a) or the estate of the Folcingas'.
Folc, however, as in 'people or nation' was also used in the Anglo-Saxon period as a district name (e.g. Norfolk) and may have been related to the Scandinavian fylki, meaning district. Could folc, therefore, also refer to a territorial district which became the soke of Folkingham? Folkstone probably derives its name from 'Folca's Stone', which was a meeting place of a territorial area.
In the mid-18th century an alternative spelling of 'Falkingham' was introduced, perhaps in an effort to make the place name sound more genteel - its correct pronunciation is 'Fokingham'. This variant became predominant in the 19th century, but fell out of favour in the early 20th century.
History
A castle was built in the 12th century by Gilbert de Gant, Earl of Lincoln and enlarged by Henry Beaumont in the 14th century. He was given a licence to crenellate it in 1312. The last documentary record of occupation of this castle dates from 1372. John Leland described it as a ruin in 1535, in which state it survived until the Civil war. The site was later used as the village house of correction.
In the late 18th century, Folkingham marketplace was used for stacking timber. Around it was a horse pond, a market cross and a small town hall. The marketplace was divided by chains into areas for sheep, cattle, horses and poultry, and for the sale of farm produce and other wares. In 1788 the third Richard Wynne, then lord of the manor, was in financial difficulties and sold off the estate to Sir Gilbert Heathcote, whose great-grandfather, the first baronet, was a member of Parliament, Lord Mayor of London and governor of the Bank of England. When Sir Gilbert acquired the estate he wanted to transform Folkingham into a small market town. His changes included clearing the marketplace and having it equipped to cater for the stage coaches using the main London to Lincoln road which passed through.
Folkingham (then Falkingham) was the birthplace of Elizabeth Wynne Fremantle (1779–1857), the main author of The Wynne Diaries.
The Falkingham Gas Light Company was founded in 1863. The installation almost certainly used a Water gas or combined Water Gas/Producer gas system to produce gas from coal. No large-scale plant was installed in the village.
In 1940 RAF Folkingham, to the south-west of the village, began use as a Second World War airfield. It provided for troop carrier and airborne units and acted as a decoy airfield. During the 1950s and 1960s it was occupied by Bomber Command as a ballistic missile base. It is no longer in service.
Notable buildings
The House of Correction
In the early 19th century Folkingham was part of Quarter Sessions, the higher court that dispensed justice for the area, which explains why a House of Correction, or minor prison, was built. It was constructed on the site of Folkingham Castle. The surviving Grade II* listed buildings consist of the original 19th-century governor's house and gateway, dating from 1808 and 1825. It was closed in 1878 but was taken over in about 1980 by the Landmark Trust, which converted the Gateway into a holiday home.
The Greyhound
The Greyhound, once a coaching inn, dates back to 1650. It has since been converted into flats. It is a Grade II* listed building.
Parish church
The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew originates from the late 12th century and was largely completed by the late 15th, with restorations carried out in 1825, 1858 and 1860. It has early Decorated Gothic arcades and a mainly Early English chancel, with a Norman pier where there was an opening into a chantry chapel. On the south side of the church are the remains of stocks and a whipping-post. The church is a Grade I listed building.
The church is a prominent feature of the village, but is inconspicuous from the Market Place. In 2006 gale force winds blew down two of the four pinnacles, one of which fell onto the roof causing damaging costing more than £100,000 to repair. Folkingham parish is part of the South Lafford Group of parishes in the Lafford Deanery, Diocese of Lincoln.
Folkingham Manor
Folkingham Manor House is located just off the marketplace in the centre of Folkingham. It was built for Lord Clinton in the 17th century, out of stone taken from the castle/

A referendum on Chile's provisional constitution was held on 27 October 1812. The provisional constitution, which was successfully adopted, was written by dictator José Miguel Carrera's administration.
In the document, Chile declared itself sovereign, but recognized Ferdinand VII of Spain. It prohibited the then-current junta government from performing foreign (i.e. Spanish) commands, established a Senate with seven members, permitted only Roman Catholicism as the public and private religion, but recognized a number of other personal rights and freedoms.

Seymour B. London (July 1, 1915 – July 14, 2010) was an American physician and inventor who created the first automatic blood pressure monitor.
London was born on July 1, 1915, in Detroit and moved to Miami Beach, Florida as a youth together with his family, where he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1932. He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Florida, was awarded a master's degree from the University of Michigan and received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1940. He did an internship in cardiopulmonary medicine at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he met and married Rose Perrone,a fellow medical student. He returned to Miami Beach after completing his medical training and operated a medical practice for 50 years together with his wife, who died in 2008. They helped found the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the Miami Heart Institute at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
London developed the automated blood pressure machine after having to spend time on multiple occasions fumbling to take a patient's blood pressure by hand. He created the original prototype of his patented device using an old blood pressure cuff, a column of mercury, a pump from a fish tank and a microphone. To demonstrate the accuracy of their device, London and his wife conducted a double blind study of 400 physicians at the 1965 annual convention of the American Medical Association. The study findings, which demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between the results taken automatically and those done by hand, were published in a November 1966 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. In addition to a United States patent, the device was also patented in France, Germany and Italy. After his death, his daughter announced plans to donate the original model of the device to the Medical School of the University of Miami.
London died on July 14, 2010, at age 95, at his home in Miami Beach, Florida from heart disease.

Cacography is bad spelling or bad handwriting. The term in the sense of "poor spelling, accentuation, and punctuation" is a semantic antonym to orthography, and in the sense of "poor handwriting" it is an etymological antonym to the word calligraphy: cacography is from Greek κακός (kakos "bad") and γραφή (graphe "writing").
Cacography is also deliberate comic misspelling, a type of humour similar to malapropism.
A common usage of cacography is to caricature illiterate speakers, as with eye dialect spelling. Others include the use to indicate that something was written by a child, to indirectly voice a cute or funny animal in a meme such as the captioned photo of a British shorthair that was the namesake of I Can Have Cheezburger?, or because the misspelling bears a humorous resemblance to a completely unrelated word.

Bhai Lal Mohammad or Bhai Lal Mohammad Amritsari (died 1962) was an Indian and Pakistani classical music singer of the Kapurthala Gharana trained in the Gwalior style of singing.
Early life and training
Bhai Lal Mohammad was born in Amritsar, British India. His background was from a rababi family of musicians and he received his initial training from his father Bhai Ata Muhammad, a disciple of Mian Bannay Khan of the Gwalior gharana. After his father's death, Bhai Lal Mohammad started learning from Mian Mahboob Ali, a renowned sitar player of the Kapurthala gharana.
Bhai Lal Mohammad also was a disciple of Pandit Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale. Bhaskarbuwa himself had learned from Ustad Faiz Mohammad Khan (Gwalior gharana), Ustad Bande Ali Khan (Kirana gharana), Ustad Natthan Khan (Agra gharana), and Ustad Alladiya Khan of Kohlapur (Jaipur-Atrauli gharana).
Career
Bhai Lal Mohammad received the title of Sangeet Sagar in 1927 at the Shikarpur Music Conference. In 1936, Bhai Lal's elder son, Nisar Hassan came down with tuberculosis and died at the young age of 26. Bhai Lal then decided to train his younger son, Ghulam Hassan Shaggan, to continue his musical legacy and the family tradition.
After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Bhai Lal Mohammad's family moved to Lahore, against the wishes and requests of friends and disciples to stay back in Amritsar, India. In Pakistan, Bhai Lal was appointed music supervisor at Radio Pakistan, Lahore and his son Ghulam Hassan Shaggan started performing at the same radio station. Since Pakistan was a newly independent country and had meager economic resources, the next 12 years proved to be extremely difficult for Bhai Lal and his family. During this time, Pakistani people were struggling economically and recognition of classical arts was not a high priority.
Death and legacy
Bhai Lal Mohammad died in 1962 at Lahore, Pakistan. His musical legacy was continued by his son Ghulam Hassan Shaggan (1928 – 3 February 2015) and now, after the son's death in 2015, by his grandsons, Qadir Hassan Shaggan and Mazhar Hassan Shaggan.

Kelz Airfield is a former World War II military airfield in Germany. It was located about 2 miles north of Vettweiß (Nordrhein-Westfalen); approximately 315 miles southwest of Berlin.
The airfield was built by the United States Army Air Forces during March 1945 as a temporary Advanced Landing Ground as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. It was closed in July 1945 and dismantled.
History
The airfield was built by the IX Engineer Command, 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion on a flat, agricultural area near the village of Kelz in the North Rhine-Westphalia. The airfield was constructed using Pierced Steel Planking, 5000' long aligned east–west (09/27). In addition, tents were erected for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump was created for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water; and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting was installed.
Opened on 24 March 1945, Ninth Air Force moved the P-47 Thunderbolts of the 48th Fighter Group to the field on 26 March, followed shortly by the P-47s of the 404th Fighter Group on 30 March. The Thunderbolts flew support missions, patrolling roads; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops when spotted.
Both combat groups moved out at the end of April 1945, the airfield being used afterward for resupply and casualty evacuation. The airfield remained open until July when it was closed and dismantled. Today, the location of the former airfield a mixture of agricultural fields with little or no evidence of its existence.

The feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), also known as the pygmy gliding possum, pygmy glider, pygmy phalanger, flying phalanger and flying mouse, is a species of marsupial native to eastern Australia. It is the world's smallest gliding mammal and is named for its long feather-shaped tail.
A second species, the broad-toed feathertail glider (Acrobates (Dromicia) frontalis, De Vis 1887) is recognised by some authors based on unpublished genetic studies and cryptic morphological differences in toe and tail characteristics. With this recognition, it is suggested that Acrobates pygmaeus takes the common name narrow-toed feathertail glider.
Description
At just in head-and-body length and weighing about , the feathertail glider is only around the size of a small mouse, and is the world's smallest gliding mammal. The fur is soft and silky, and is a uniform greyish brown on the upper body, and white on the underside. There are rings of dark fur around the eyes, the rhinarium is hairless and deeply cleft, and the ears are moderately large and rounded. The glider also has an unusually large number of whiskers, sprouting from the snout and cheeks, and from the base of each ear.
Like other gliding mammals, the feathertail glider has a patagium stretching between the fore and hind legs. Only reaching the elbows and knees, this is smaller than that of the petaurid gliding possums, although the presence of a fringe of long hairs increases its effective area. The tail is about the same length as the head and body combined, oval in cross-section, only slightly prehensile, and has very short fur except for two distinctive rows of long, stiff hairs on either side. This gives the tail the appearance of a feather or a double-sided comb. The hindfeet possess enlarged, opposable first digits, which unlike all the other toes on both fore and hind feet, lack claws.
The tongue is long and thin, reaching as much as , and has numerous long papillae that give it a brush-like appearance. This improves the animal's ability to collect pollen and consume semi-liquid food. The structure of the ear is also unusual, since the animal possesses a unique bony disc with a narrow crescent-shaped slit just in front of the eardrum. The function of this bone is unclear, but it may act as a Helmholtz resonator and enhance sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound. The brain has been recorded as weighing .
The female has two vaginae, which merge into a single sinus before opening into a cloaca together with the rectum. The pouch opens towards the front, as is common in diprotodont marsupials, and contains four teats.
Distribution and habitat
Feathertail gliders are found across the eastern seaboard of continental Australia, from northern Queensland to Victoria and extreme south-eastern South Australia. There are no recognised subspecies. They inhabit a wide range of forest types across the region, from sea level to at least . Fossils belonging to the genus Acrobates have been identified from deposits in Queensland dating back to 0.5 million years ago, during the late Pleistocene.
Behaviour and biology
Feathertail gliders are omnivorous, feeding on nectar, pollen, and arthropods such as moths, ants, and termites. They are arboreal, and although they do occasionally descend to the ground to forage, they spend as much as 87% of their time over above the ground, particularly in eucalyptus trees. They are nocturnal, spending the day resting in nests in tree hollows, lined with leaves or shredded bark. They are social animals, and up to five may share a single nest, especially during the breeding season.
They are highly adept climbers, able to cling to the smooth trunks of eucalyptus trees. In experiments, they have even proved able to climb vertical panes of glass, a feat that is due to a combination of fine skin ridges and sweat that allow their feet to function as suction cups. Movement through the trees is aided by their gliding ability; they are able to glide as far as , and typically do so three to five times every hour through the night.
Feathertail gliders do not hibernate as such, but are capable of entering torpor during cold weather at any time of the year. Torpor can last for several days, during which time the animal's body temperature can drop to as low as and oxygen consumption to just 1% of normal. Torpid gliders curl into a ball, wrapping their tail around themselves and folding their ears flat, and often huddling together with up to four other individuals to reduce heat loss and conserve energy.
The breeding season lasts from July to January in Victoria, and may be longer further to the north. Females typically give birth to two litters of up to four young in a season, and are able to mate again shortly after the first litter is born. The second litter than enters embryonic diapause, and is not born until the first litter has finished weaning at about 105 days. Multiple paternity is common, even within litters, as the females are sexually promiscuous. The young remain in the pouch for the first 65 days of life, and the maximum lifespan is about five years.
In captivity
The New Zoo in Poznań, Poland, was the first European zoo to breed feathertail gliders in 1999 (their animals originated from Sydney's Taronga Zoo). Some of the feathertail gliders born in Poznań have been sent to other European zoos, meaning that the entire European captive population is of Poznań descent. Australia's Taronga Zoo was the first zoo to breed feathertail gliders in captivity.
In culture
A feathertail glider was featured on the reverse of the Australian 1-cent coin until 1991 when the 1-cent denomination was discontinued.

Ragle Glacier () is a small glacier that drains the west end of the Fosdick Mountains, between Mount Ferranto and Mount Avers, which flows northwest to Block Bay, in Marie Byrd Land. The glacier was photographed by the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) (1939–41), led by Admiral Byrd, and was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos (1959–65). Named for Dr. B. Harrison Ragle, Admiral Byrd's personal physician in the late 1930s, who made financial contributions toward purchase of first aid equipment and medical supplies for USAS (1939–41) and was a consultant on medical matters for that expedition.

The Inbestigators (stylised The InBESTigators) is an Australian mockumentary children's television series created by Robyn Butler and Wayne Hope. The show stars Abby Bergman, Anna Cooke, Aston Droomer and Jamil Smyth-Secka as Ava Andrikides, Maudie Miller, Ezra Banks and Kyle Klimson, respectively, fifth-graders who solve crimes in their school and neighbourhood. The series has the comic tone of Little Lunch (another series on which they had worked) and an air of mystery. The show aired in two series from 21 June to 30 November 2019 on ABC Me. Netflix released the first and second series in mid-2019 and early 2020 respectively.
The Inbestigators garnered critical acclaim, with praise for its humour and cast, though its characters drew mixed opinions. The show received two AACTA Award nominations for Best Children's Television Series. A spin-off web series, The InBESTigators: Crime Crack, was released in July 2019; a cast Q&A was released in late 2019, followed by a study guide during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Premise
The series is centred around Ezra Banks, a tech-savvy boy; Maudie Miller, a socially-awkward, intelligent aspiring private investigator; Ava Andrikides, an outgoing, dramatic girl; and Kyle Klimson, an athletic goof.

Development
The InBESTigators is based on an original idea by Robyn Butler. It was created by Robyn Butler and Wayne Hope, who are also known for Little Lunch. After the success of Little Lunch, Butler and Hope wanted to create another children's comedy. For The Inbestigators, they "took the comic tone of Little Lunch and married with it the private detective, mystery genre". Butler explained that she and Hope created the show as a reaction to the "world [they are] living in", which she considered toxic and affected children's viewpoints. In response, she decided to make a show about kids with "ethnic diversity and gender equity and respect and integrity and kindness" to encourage "something else" in children. Screen Australia head of production Sally Callan said, "It's vital that young Australians are able to see their country, their stories and hear their accent reflected on the screen ... The characters in The InBESTigators ... are distinctive and inclusive, and tell stories that are innovative and culturally significant." In June 2018, ABC and Screen Australia greenlit the series. Development was funded by the Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF) and ABC.
Writing for The Inbestigators, by Robyn Butler, Wayne Hope, Molly Daniels, Lisa Marie Corso, Maddy Butler, Jayden Masciulli and Bob Franklin, began in 2017. Butler and Hope instructed the writers to keep the scripts clear and simple without dumbing them down, and to ensure that the children's dialogue was child-like: "Rather than writing what was funny or nostalgic for them, they had to get into the bones of a 10-year-old."
After the scripts were written, the team began to focus on the main cast; they sought talent and confidence. After 715 auditions, newcomers Aston Droomer, Anna Cooke, Abby Bergman and Jamil Smyth-Secka were cast as Ezra Banks, Maudie Miller, Ava Andrikides and Kyle Klimson. The series used many children in guest roles, most of whom had auditioned for the main roles. Cooke heard about auditions for The Inbestigators through her school newsletter. She thought it "looked [like] fun", and attended "three or four auditions". For the role, she cut her hair short. In the auditions, Bergman learnt and performed lines for the casting agency. She attended four auditions, the last of which was the chemistry read. Droomer's agency, Emma Raciti Management, sent an audition request for his role in The Inbestigators. Before the first audition, he needed to learn two scripts; for the following auditions he learnt more scripts, met with the series' creators and did a chemistry read.
The Inbestigators used a single-camera setup. To create 40 episodes, the production team required outside funding, which Netflix provided. Production was originally scheduled for July to November 2018. Filming began on 19 July 2018 at Moorabbin Primary School in Melbourne, and the wrap date was pushed back to December. The children worked for eight hours a day, with ten-minute breaks each hour and tutoring on set. Filming wrapped in November. Dan Maxwell was the series' photography director, and Simon McCutcheon was its production designer. The creators originally wanted to create the detective-agency set at their Port Melbourne production office; realising that travel would be difficult, however, they built it in the staff car park. Episodes were not filmed chronologically; scenes at the same location were shot together. There was a one-week break between filming of the first and second series. They needed to be filmed simultaneously due to the child actors' rapid growth.
Themes
The Inbestigators focusses on themes of honesty, loyalty, kindness, friendship, teamwork and responsibility. According to TV Tonight, instead of "nasty adult vices", the show's crimes are justified by desires to fit in or avoid loneliness. When caught, culprits apologise and learn a lesson or moral, which, according to Common Sense Media, are pertinent to tweens.

It will premiere on WildBrainTV in Canada on March 10, 2022.
Reception
Critical response
The Inbestigators has received critical acclaim. The show has been listed as one of Netflix's best Australian, detective, educational, and children's series by Screen Rant, The Cinemaholic, Variety and Stuff respectively.
The show's comical aspects attracted praise. Reviewers found the series hilarious and "genuinely funny". Decider Joel Keller said "[i]t's got a sharp sense of humour with a lot of gentle snarkiness". He and Common Sense Media writer Mandie Caroll argued adults would enjoy The Inbestigators due to its comical aspects. In addition, critics thought the Australian actors had a natural approach to comedy. Caroll described their line deliveries as "often dripping with kid-friendly sarcasm and good-natured humour"; Keller assured that the show would be of lower quality with British or American actors. Additionally, reviewers lauded the racial diversity.
Journalists have had mixed opinions on the characters. They deemed the characters stereotypical; critics believed they matched tropes such as the geek and the jock. Despite this, Mumtaj Begum of The Star stated the show's writing and liveliness made such stereotypes less irritating. Aside from the clichés, Carrol considered the characters "[l]ikeable, interesting ... [and] role-model worthy". She also praised the show for breaking gender stereotypes.

Sennaya Ploshchad (, Sennaya Square) is a station on the Moskovsko-Petrogradskaya Line of Saint Petersburg Metro.
History
The station opened on 1 July 1963. It is a deep underground pylon station. Its surface vestibule is situated near Sennaya Square, which gives its name to the station. The Saviour Church on Sennaya Square was demolished to give way for construction of the entrance to the station. Before 1992 both the square and the station were known under the name Ploshchad Mira (Peace Square). In June 1999 the concrete canopy of the surface vestibule collapsed, killing seven. The station is connected to the station Spasskaya of the Pravoberezhnaya Line and Sadovaya of the Frunzensko-Primorskaya Line via an underground transfer corridor.
On 3 April 2017, a suicide bomber blew himself up on a train between stations Sennaya Ploschad and Tekhnologichesky Institut, leaving 14 people dead and at least 49 people injured.

A Mannich base is a beta-amino-ketone, which is formed in the reaction of an amine, formaldehyde (or an aldehyde) and a carbon acid. The Mannich base is an endproduct in the Mannich reaction, which is nucleophilic addition reaction of a non-enolizable aldehyde and any primary or secondary amine to produce resonance stabilized imine (iminium ion or imine salt). The addition of a carbanion from a CH acidic compound (any enolizable carbonyl compound, amide, carbamate, hydantoin or urea) to the imine gives the Mannich base.
Reactivity
With primary or secondary amines, Mannich bases react with additional aldehyde and carbon acid to larger adducts HN(CH2CH2COR)2 and N(CH2CH2COR)3. With multiple acidic hydrogen atoms on the carbon acid higher adducts are also possible. Ammonia can be split off in an elimination reaction to form enals and enones.

The private halls of the University of Oxford were educational institutions within the University. They were introduced by the statute De aulis privatis ("On private halls") in 1855 to provide a less expensive alternative to the colleges and academic halls of the early nineteenth century. They survived until 1918, when the last two private halls were recognised as permanent private halls.
History
In the 19th century various factions at Oxford called for reform of the university. In 1850 the prime minister, Lord John Russell, asked a Royal Commission to investigate the University of Oxford; however the Earl of Derby had taken over as prime minister by the time the commissioners published their report in 1852. The commissioners' report found that potential students were deterred by the cost of living in one of the existing colleges or halls of the university as required by the university statutes of the time. It therefore recommended that the university should be allowed to expand by opening new halls of residence and by allowing students to live in lodgings not connected to the existing colleges or halls. A proposal allowing MAs of the University to open private halls was included in the Oxford University Act 1854, and the university accordingly issued its statute de aulis privatis in 1855. The statute allowed MAs of the university over the age of twenty-eight with the approval of the vice-chancellor to open private halls within one and a half miles of Carfax as “licensed masters”. In the period 1855 to 1918 thirteen such halls were established, but never recruited large numbers of students. The longest lived was Charsley's Hall.
Further reforms allowed the admission of non-collegiate students in 1868 and opening of Keble College in 1870, which both offered lower costs than the older colleges. In 1871, the Universities Tests Act allowed Catholics and dissenters to take degrees at the university (apart from theology); however a papal decree forbidding Catholics studying at Oxford or Cambridge was not withdrawn until 1895. Shortly afterwards, the Jesuits opened Clarke's Hall (1896) and the Benedictines Hunter-Blair's Hall (1899). In 1918 a university statute was issued to allow the opening of permanent private halls situated less than 2 1/2 miles from Carfax and not run for profit. The only two remaining private halls took the opportunity to become permanent as Campion Hall and St Benet's Hall.

The National Underclassmen Combine/NUC Sports is a professional, privately owned recruiting program and three-day training and assessment function for high school football players to display their skills and potential. It is one of the largest and most successful programs of its kind, the purpose of which is to connect talented football athletes with collegiate programs willing to offer them a scholarship. Notable players to go through the system include Joe Haden, cornerback for the NFL's Cleveland Browns, and Marcus Lattimore, star running back for the University of South Carolina. Founded by former University of Connecticut linebacker David Schuman, the first combine event was held in New Jersey in 2005.
Philosophy and objectives
According to ESPN recruiting analyst Jamie Newberg, “Combines … are platforms for kids to get initially identified, for young kids to emerge, etc.” Dave Schuman, the founder of National Underclassmen Combine, observes that college football programs are now looking to younger students as potential recruits. Previously, a football player would not have to consider his options for playing collegiate football until his senior year. Now many elite programs are extending scholarship offers to students at the beginning of their junior years of high school.
Combine structure
A typical weekend combine organized by National Underclassmen is a three-day event. The first day consists of preparatory events: combine prep training, positions skill training and All American recruiting. Day 2 includes the actual combines: tests of athletic ability and football-specific skills. Seventh through ninth graders participate in the morning, while sophomores and juniors work out during the afternoon...
The tests and drills on day two of the combine allow athletes to gauge their abilities against competition. Standard drills include the 40-yard dash, shuttle run, bench press and vertical leap. National Underclassmen Combine also administers position-specific drills, such as throwing strength and accuracy, catching ability, and offensive and defensive line work.
Day three consists of special events such as a 7-on-7 tournament and “trench warfare” for linesmen. Additionally, an awards ceremony for the most exceptional athletes of the weekend is held at the end of day three. Event managers hand out the overall MVP (most valuable player) award and positional MVP awards, as well as a number of other awards, including The Strongest Man and Combine King.
The top participants from all of the national combines are invited to take part in the regional Ultimate 100 camps. According to the National Underclassmen website, 50 percent of those invited to an Ultimate 100 camp go on to play college football at the Division 1 or 1aa level. The format of these camps is similar to the standard National Underclassmen weekend combine. The first Ultimate 100 camp was held in 2006.
Combine recruiting process
No explicit eligibility criteria exist, but participants must compete within their age group. NUC is the longest running underclassmen event and it's the most respected high school combine and football camp in the country. If you're serious about taking your game to the next level, playing college football or getting early exposure to college recruiters then attend an NUC Recruiting Event. NUC Sports has Combines, Showcases, Invite Only Camps, All Star Games, and 7 on 7 Tournaments. All NUC Sports Recruiting Events are in place to help the Athletes compete, get noticed, get exposure and get recruited.
Results are made available to college coaches in the form of a report. Major sports sites such as ESPN.com and Rivals.com also regularly cover news from the combines.
Issues with recruitment of young athletes
The recruitment of young players is not without controversy. Some coaches and parents worry that, just as in the classroom, some athletes may not “test” well and therefore have a blemish on their recruiting record, not to mention the potential psychological damage of falling short of their goals. Others have expressed concern that combines are too expensive for some families.
Notable players from National Underclassmen Combine

Steven Kunes (born 1956) is an American conman and former screenwriter. He has been convicted of felony commercial burglary and grand theft by false pretenses.
Early life and education
Kunes was born in 1956 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1974 from Neshaminy High School, and attended college at New York University.
Career
Kunes' IMDb page claims writing credits for an episode of the TV show The Love Boat and a TV movie Alvin Goes Back to School, as well as various roles as an "uncredited creative consultant", but it has been heavily edited and redacted. At various times he has claimed to have written Johnny Carson's final monologue, worked on a Harry Potter film, and written the biopic Catch Me If You Can. In 2011, Kunes wrote a number of guest commentaries that were published by Santa Barbara media outlets. It was eventually discovered that they had largely been plagiarized from Newsweek columns and they were removed from websites.
With Norman Lear, Kunes co-wrote a pilot TV episode for NBC in August 1984 called P.O.P. about a "lovable con artist" and he was a writer on two single-season sitcoms, a.k.a. Pablo in 1984 on ABC and Marblehead Manor in 1987-88.
Kunes sold the screenplay First Comes Love for $1.2 million in 1992, though no film was made.
Kunes is a member of the Writers Guild of America, West, the Authors Guild, the Dramatists Guild, and PEN America.
Legal issues
In 1982, Kunes attempted to sell to People magazine an interview with reclusive author J. D. Salinger, whom he claimed he had met. Salinger sued and settled the case under the conditions that Kunes was "permanently enjoined from representing by any means that he is associated with Salinger", barred from "exhibiting, transmitting or exhibiting documents, writing or statements attributed to Salinger" and "required to collect and turn over any such documents or writings for destruction". The interview was never published. He later succeeded in selling a fake interview with Jimmy Buffett to the Santa Barbara Daily Sound.
Kunes was arrested on March 17, 2011, for purportedly swindling his friend, former Café Buenos Aires owner Wally Ronchietto, out of $2,000 for a nonexistent movie deal. On April 23, 2011, Noozhawk, a Santa Barbara online publication, announced that it had removed six of Kunes' articles from its digital archives as two contained plagiarized passages.
On August 27, 2011, a Santa Barbara judge issued a $200,000 bench warrant for his arrest when he failed to appear in court. Thought to have been hiding in Bucks County, he was apprehended in New Jersey less than a month later.
At court, Kunes pleaded guilty and admitted to forging checks.
On May 4, 2012, he was sentenced to five years in jail for felony commercial burglary and grand theft by false pretenses. A plea deal allowed for a sentence of only four years if Kunes had paid restitution to his victims, but no payments were made.
In February 2013, Kunes was re-arrested. He had been serving his five-year sentence and had been approved for electronic monitoring on August 1, 2012. Kunes removed the device on August 22, 2012, and mailed the device back to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. A photo posted on the Sheriff's Office Facebook page led to his identification at a Carpinteria cafe and his subsequent arrest. He was released from prison in June 2015 but arrested again for violating the terms of his probation after falsely telling the Bucks County Courier Times that he was producing a Netflix series called Over My Dead Body.

John Shuter (9 February 1855 – 5 July 1920) was a cricketer who played for England and Surrey in the late 19th century. He is best remembered for captaining Surrey to a string of wins in the County Championship around the time it became official in 1890, aided by the bowler George Lohmann and back up by John Sharpe and William Lockwood. Shuter first led Surrey to the County Championship in 1887. They then came first in 1888, tied with Lancashire and Nottinghamshire in 1889, and won again in 1890, 1891 and 1892. Shuter was a batsman and chiefly an off-side player.
Shuter was born in Thornton Heath, Surrey, England, the son of Leonard Shuter, a stave timber merchant, and Caroline. John went to Winchester College, playing in its cricket eleven from 1871 to 1873. Though a Surrey man by birth, Shuter had played much club cricket in Bexley and was thus qualified by residence for Kent. After a single match in 1874, Shuter was rejected by Kent. He first played for his native county in 1877 and the following year jumped abruptly to the front rank of batsmen. He scored a century (then an exceptional feat due to the primitive pitches) against Sussex at Hove the following year and in 1880 became captain of Surrey.
At first, rewards for this move were slow and Surrey entered a crisis around 1883 - by which time Shuter had become established as one of the best batsmen in England despite a number of failures for the Gentlemen against the Players in the years since 1879. However, after overcoming the crisis Surrey rapidly developed into a top-flight county side through Lohmann's bowling, which headed the list of first-class wicket-takers for seven successive years from 1885 to 1891. Shuter had his best seasons in batting from 1882 to 1887, though he never reached 1,000 runs in a season. He played one Test on his home ground in 1888, but by 1890, with only one score of over fifty, it was clear his best days as a batsman were over. He continued though, to play a major role as captain of Surrey until 1893, when owing to the failure of Abel and their other top batsmen, they declined from first to sixth among nine counties.
Shuter made no score above 44 that season and owing to business resigned the captaincy. His only subsequent first-class match was for Surrey against Oxford University in 1909 at the age of fifty-four - with a team including Bill Hitch, over thirty-one years younger.
Long after he retired he was appointed as a Test selector (for the triangular tournament held in 1912) and secretary of Surrey in 1919 - a role which he did not hold for long as a stroke caused his sudden death in 1920. Although most noted for his cricketing exploits, Shuter joined his father in business as a stave timber merchant and cooper. His nephew, Leonard Shuter, was also a first-class cricketer.

Karutha Rathrikal () is a 1967 Indian Malayalam-language science fiction thriller film directed by P. Subramaniam under the name Mahesh. An adaptation of the 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson, it was the first science fiction film in the history of Malayalam cinema.
Plot
Santhan, a medical practitioner, is in love with his cousin Vimala, with whom his marriage is fixed. Vimala's father, a banker, died under mysterious circumstances. Santhan develops a medicine, which transforms a person into a monstrous creature when consumed. He also invents the formula that reverts the person back to their original self. Santhan keeps this invention a secret. After reading his uncle's diary, Santhan realises that other voracious directors of the bank are responsible for his death. Santhan plans revenge on them by utilising his invention.
Vimala's cousin Mohan is in love with Vilasini, a night club dancer. The other bank directors influence Mohan, through Vilasini, and try to steal the bank documents from Vimala's house. A monstrous creature appears before Vilasini and threatens her death if she acts accordingly. Vilasini discovers that Santhan is the one killing the bank directors. Mohan also learns about the secret that Santhan is the monstrous creature.
Vimala's uncle Kochammavan comes to the city to conduct Vimala and Santhan's marriage. The police also arrive there in pursuit of the monstrous creature. Mohan reaches the spot and exposes Santhan, who then transforms himself into the monstrous creature. But before the police can arrest Santhan, he commits suicide.

The Rockford Peaches were a women's professional baseball team who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. A founding member, the team represented Rockford, Illinois.
The Peaches were one of two teams to play in every AAGPBL season, the other being the South Bend Blue Sox. They played their home games at Beyer Stadium on 15th Avenue in Rockford. The team's uniform consisted of a peach colored dress featuring the Rockford city seal centered on the chest, along with red socks and cap. In later years, the Peaches wore a white home uniform with black socks and cap.
History
One of the more successful teams in the AAGPBL, the Peaches won the league championship in 1945, 1948, 1949, and 1950 and had its share of star players. Dyes were hard to come by towards the end of the war and the team chose to dye their white uniforms a light shade of peach, which inspired the team nickname.
Peaches players who were named to the All-Star teams from 1946 to 1954 included Dorothy Kamenshek, Lois Florreich, Dorothy Harrell, Carolyn Morris, Alice Pollitt, Ruth Richard, Rose Gacioch, Eleanor Callow, and Joan Berger. Pitcher Olive Little hurled the first no-hitter both in team and league history. In addition, Florreich was the pitching champion in 1949 during the league's overhand era, and Gladys Davis won the league batting crown in the 1943 inaugural season, while Kamenshek earned the honors in the 1946 and 1947 seasons.
When former player Eileen Burmeister was asked why The Peaches supposedly favored theatricality over technical skill, she replied, "If God meant to us to play baseball, He would've made us any good at it.".
The last living player of the first Peaches roster in AAGPBL, pitcher Mary Pratt, died on May 6, 2020, at the age of 101.

Railway Administration Building is a heritage-listed former office building at 233 Denison Street, Rockhampton, Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1886. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2005.
History
The former Railway Administration Building at Rockhampton was constructed in 1886 to a design prepared in the Office of the Chief Engineer for Railways. Its construction reflects the importance of Rockhampton as the coastal terminus of the Central Western railway line and the important role of the Central Western and North Coast railway lines in opening the Rockhampton hinterland and central western Queensland to settlement and economic exploitation, especially pastoralism and mining, during the last three decades of the 19th century.
The Port Curtis Pastoral District was proclaimed in 1854 following pastoral exploration of the Fitzroy, Dawson and Mackenzie River systems and the Broadsound and Peak Downs areas in the early 1850s. A small settlement was established at Rockhampton in 1856 to service the pastoral properties being taken up in the district, but until the nearby Canoona gold rush of 1858, comprised little more than a few buildings and a small wharf. In 1858 the township of Rockhampton was surveyed, gazetted and proclaimed a port of entry.
A key impetus to the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859 was the complaint that the Sydney-based New South Wales government spent little on transport and communications infrastructure in the northern districts. One of the first agenda items for the Queensland Government was the establishment of a railway system. In 1863 plans were approved for construction of the Southern railway line, a narrow gauge system to link the pastoral properties of the Darling Downs with coastal and international shipping. Although less populated and having a much smaller economic base than the Darling Downs, Port Curtis and Leichhardt district pastoralists argued that a rail link to the coast was essential to develop the area. Their political influence in the Queensland Parliament resulted in a deal being struck: their support for the southern line in exchange for a second Central Western rail line to be constructed linking the Rockhampton hinterland to the coast. The discovery of rich copper deposits at Peak Downs west of Rockhampton strengthened the central Queensland case.
The Rockhampton railway was approved in October 1864. Work commenced in 1865 and the Central Western line (then known as the Great Northern Railway) opened to Westwood in September 1867. A two-storeyed, prefabricated iron station and goods shed were imported from England and erected at the coastal terminus in Stanley Street, Rockhampton. Wayside stations were established at Gracemere, Stanwell and Westwood. These were of Queensland design and construction.
The line was too short to be profitable and approval for an extension was granted in late 1872, opening to the Dawson River in 1874, Duaringa in 1876, Blackwater (where coal had been discovered) in 1877 and Emerald in 1879. After Bogantungan (1881) the most difficult section was encountered - the ascent of the Drummond Range. Longreach, the western terminus of the Central Western Railway, was reached in 1892.
These railway extensions increased rail traffic in Rockhampton and by the mid-1880s additional administrative offices were needed. In 1884 FWC Kerr, a casual draftsman in the Central and Northern Division of the Chief Engineer for Railways' Office, worked on the plans for a new, substantial brick administration building for Rockhampton. This was constructed in 1886 at the corner of Denison and Stanley streets, diagonally opposite the 1867 station. It was unusual for Queensland Railways to construct a stand-alone brick office building; most of the larger railway office buildings were combined with passenger stations (such as at Roma Street and Central stations in Brisbane and the Townsville railway station) and in other centres tended to be smaller and of timber construction. Offices for a pay clerk were added in 1926.
Until 1982 the building functioned as headquarters for the Central Western Railway and later Central Division except for a brief period in the late 1890s when Central Division was combined with Southern Division, for economic reasons.
The original prefabricated station in Stanley Street was demolished in 1973 and replaced by a new station building. On 10 November 1982 a new railway administration building was opened adjacent to the 1970s station.
The 1886 railways administration building was refurbished as a Driver Training Centre in 1985. Alterations at this time included the installation of fire escape stairs and internally, suspended ceilings, fluorescent lighting, a new staircase, new joinery and a new office fitout. The building was vacated again in 1994 then occupied briefly by Queensland Rail in 2000 before being sold.
In 2010, the building is used as the Denison Boutique Hotel.
Description
The former Railway Administration Building is located near the Rockhampton city centre on the corner of Stanley and Denison streets, diagonally opposite the main railyards. It retains a physical relationship with the North Coast Railway along the middle of Denison Street, which passes the former railway office building before crossing the intersection of Dension and Stanley streets to enter the railyard.
The former administration building is a two-storeyed, painted brick structure with a hipped roof and open verandahs to both levels on all sides. It has ornamental cast iron lace balustrades to the upper verandahs and cast iron columns to both levels. Original external timber joinery survives. The ground floor external walls have rendered quoins painted in a contrasting colour. The rear corners have timber fire escape stairs contained within the perimeter of the verandahs.
There is a low concrete fence along both street frontages. The grounds include mature Hoop Pines and palm trees.
Internal alterations made in 1985 - including suspended ceilings, fluorescent lighting, new staircase, new joinery and new office fitout - are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.
Heritage listing
The former Railway Administration Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 July 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The former Railway Administration Building, Rockhampton, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, illustrating the importance of Rockhampton as a major railway administration centre and the significance of the Central and North Coast railways to the central Queensland economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
It demonstrates an uncommon aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage, being the most substantial purpose-built railway administration building extant in Queensland; other substantial administration centres (including Central and Roma Street in Brisbane and Townsville Station) combine with railway passenger stations.

Sergei Vladimirovich Tarnowsky (also spelled Sergei Tarnovsky; ; 3 November 188322 March 1976) was a Russian pianist and teacher.
Biography
Tarnowsky was born in Kharkiv. Visiting musicians often visited the family home and Sergei showed an interest in the piano at an early age. At the age of eight he studied privately with Henryk Bobinski, a graduate of the Warsaw Conservatory. At age 19 he commenced studies with Anna Yesipova at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. The director of the Conservatory was Alexander Glazunov, whose adopted daughter Tarnowsky later married. On graduation, Tarnowsky received a gold medal and the Anton Rubinstein Prize.
He went to teach at Odessa, where he appeared as soloist under Vasily Safonov. Safonov was so impressed that he arranged for Tarnowsky to appear with the Berlin Philharmonic in a program of three works for piano and orchestra - concertos by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, and a Fantasy by Arensky. He then toured other European cities.
In Rome, he performed Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 1, after which he was congratulated by Cosima Wagner, who was in the audience.
In between concert tours, Tarnowsky worked at the Mariinsky Theatre with Albert Coates. He then become piano professor at the Kiev Conservatory, where he taught Vladimir Horowitz and was his only teacher from the years 1914 to 1919 (Horowitz was 11 years old when he first entered Tarnowsky's class and 16 when he left to study with Felix Blumenfeld). His other students at Kiev included Alexander Uninsky, Vladimir Yampolsky and Anatole Kitain. Tarnowsky married Glazunov's adopted daughter Elena in Leningrad on February 18, 1928, and they moved to Paris. They emigrated to the United States in 1930. In 1933, he joined the DePaul University School of Music in Chicago and appeared in concert with artists such as Nathan Milstein, William Primrose, Raya Garbousova and Maria Kurenko. He recorded an album of Tchaikovsky songs with Kurenko.
In 1938, Tarnowsky became a naturalized United States citizen with the help of his colleague at DePaul University School of Music, Richard Czerwonky, who signed as a witness on the paperwork. Tarnowsky later married one of his pupils, Maxine Matlavish, and they settled in California, where from the 1940s until his death he was one of the most sought-after piano teachers. Among the many pianists he taught during his years in Southern California is the Cuban virtuoso Horacio Gutiérrez, who Tarnowsky claimed was the biggest pianistic talent he had encountered since Vladimir Horowitz.
Other students included Rebecca Anna Lou Melson, later to become the wife and widow of William Kapell (she is now known as Anna Lou Dehavenon), and Madeleine Stowe, who gave music up to become an actress when Tarnowsky died.

The little green woodpecker, or golden-backed woodpecker, (Campethera maculosa) is a species of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Africa, living in forest edges, clearings, and forest-shrub mosaics. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as a least-concern species.
Taxonomy
This species was described by Achille Valenciennes in 1826, as Picus maculosus.
There are two subspecies:
C. m. maculosa (Valenciennes, 1826) - Senegal and Guinea-Bissau to southwestern and south-central Ghana
C. m. permista (Reichenow, 1876) - eastern Ghana and southwest South Sudan to northern Angola
The subspecies permista was formerly classified in the green-backed woodpecker (C. cailliautii), but was transferred to this species by Handbook of the Birds of the World, and in 2022 by the International Ornithological Congress.
The little green and green-backed woodpeckers have hybridised in Ghana.
Description
The little green woodpecker is about long and weighs about . The male's crown is olive-blackish with an indistinct reddish colour, and the nape is red. The head, neck and throat are buff, with brown spots. The upperparts are yellowish-green or bronze-green. The flight feathers are brown and have buffish bars. The tail is blackish, with some yellow and green. The underparts are buffish from the throat to the breast and greenish-white below the breast, all of the underparts having deep olive bars. The beak is olive or blackish, the eye is brown, and the legs are olive-grey. The female does not have red on the head and has buff spots on its crown and nape. The juvenile bird has greener upperparts with pale streaks, and its underparts are paler.
Distribution and habitat
The little green woodpecker is found in West Africa, in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana. Its range would extend east to South Sudan, Uganda, Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo if C. cailliautii permista were included in this species. Its habitat is edges of primary and secondary forests, clearings, and mosaics of forest and shrub, at elevations up to .
Behaviour
This woodpecker eats arboreal ants. Its calls are a plaintive huweeeeh, a harsh whee, kewik, three to four teeay notes, and teerweet. It excavates nests in nests of ants and termites. It breeds in August and possibly in March and April.
Status
Logging and clearing of forests appears to be causing a population increase because the bird prefers open habitats. The species has a large range and increasing population, so the IUCN has assessed it as a least-concern species.

Monkey Drummer is a 2.5-minute-long music video created by British music video director Chris Cunningham in 2001. The video was commissioned by the Anthony d'Offay Gallery in London and was meant to be a companion piece to his Flex commercial, but it was not completed in time for the exhibition in September 2000 and instead made its debut at the Venice Biennale's 49th International Exhibition of Art in June 2001. It subsequently went on to run in several exhibitions such as the Edinburgh Festival, Edinburgh College of Art, Scotland. The short is a humorous, kinetic study of a mechanical being with nine appendages—six arms, two legs, and one drumstick penis—all seemingly controlled by the head of a monkey, though it is unclear what is in control. Each flesh-and-blood body part juts from a black steel appendage and acts human, while being controlled mechanically.
Making the video
The music playing in the video is the first two and a half minutes of "Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount" by Aphex Twin. It is the 10th track on his album Drukqs, which was released in 2001.
The owner of the different body parts playing in the video is Sigtryggur Baldursson, a founding member of Icelandic rock band The Sugarcubes, and a retired member of the band Kukl. He was shot multiple times in various positions with his torso being removed in post-production and replaced with a mechanical torso.
"The idea came from those little mechanical windup monkeys from the last century, the ones with the red faces. ... Thought it would be really amazing to see a 21st Century one that was drumming to something ridiculously insane like a really fast Aphex Twin track."
Head puppetry was performed by Paul "Slash" Morris and Justin Flack.
Further information
The video was distributed on a Creative Review DVD in November 2001, and is also featured on the DVD Directors Label: The Work of Director Chris Cunningham, which was released in 2003.
The video went on to win Best 3D animation in a music video in the International Monitor Awards in 2002.

The 12 cm Luftminenwerfer M 16 (Pneumatic trench mortar) was a medium mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was developed by Austria Metal Works in Brno from their earlier, rejected, 8 cm project. It was a rigid-recoil, smooth-bore, breech-loading design that had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It was very simple in that the shell closed the top of the chamber and was retained by a "gripper" until the air pressure was deemed sufficient and the gripper was manually released, which fired the weapon. An additional barrel could be fitted to extend the range. A cylinder of compressed air was good for eleven shots.
After an evaluation on 23 November 1915 it was deemed superior to the German designs already in service (10.5 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 and 15 cm Luftminenwerfer M 15 M. E.) in range and accuracy and a batch of 100 mortars and 50,000 bombs was ordered at the beginning of 1916. Some 280 were at the front by the end of 1916 and 930 by the end of 1917. In addition to Austria Metal Works it was produced by Brand & L'Huillier and the machine factory at Brno-Köningsfeld. Some improvements must have been made over the course of the production run because late-war documents refer to the original design as the M 16a (alte?), but what exactly was changed is unknown.

Giraud Peak is a 12,608-foot-elevation (3,843 meter) mountain summit located west of the crest of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, in Fresno County of northern California, United States. It is situated in the Palisades area of northern Kings Canyon National Park, southwest of North Palisade, and southwest of Columbine Peak, the nearest higher neighbor. Giraud Peak ranks as the 258th-highest summit in California. Topographic relief is significant as the west aspect rises 4,400 feet (1,340 meters) above LeConte Canyon in less than two miles. On the direct opposite side of the canyon The Citadel stands guard. The first ascent of the summit was made September 1, 1925, by Norman Clyde via the east arête.
Etymology
This mountain's name has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names. It was probably named for Pierre "Little Pete" Giraud (1874–1907), a shepherd of Inyo County who was made famous in Mary Austin's 1906 book, The Flock. Pierre and his younger brother, Alfred, were French immigrants who arrived in the Owens Valley, where they grazed sheep for many years at the head of the South and Middle Forks of Kings River.
Climate
Giraud Peak is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range (orographic lift). Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Middle Fork Kings River.

Matlab Uttar () is an upazila of Chandpur District in the division of Chittagong, Bangladesh. The former Matlab Upazila was divided into two in 2000, Matlab Dakshin and Matlab Uttar.
History
During the Mughal period, when the Lalar Hat Bazaar, located on the banks of the Dhanagoda River, a tributary of the Gumti, at the northern end of the present villages of Babu Para and Pail Para, was destroyed by river erosion, a market called Bairagir Hat at the northern end of the Kaladi village was founded by the Jamadar of Matlab. Jealous of this, the Zamindar of Faridpur increased his zamindari and established another market in his name in the western part south of the Bairagir Hat. After some time, both the markets became very competitive and Jamadar's haat bazaar became popularly known as Matlab rather than Bairagir Hat. The name Matlab was gazetted on 9 August 1918. Gazette No. 236. In 1900, the government divided the Chandpur circle and created the Matlab circle. As a result, the progress of police station with 22 unions started.
During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, the area was under the control of Bengali freedom fighters. Whenever the Pakistan Army tried to enter the area, skirmishes would take place. A hospital was established for the wounded freedom fighters in the village of Nishchintapur. There were also mass graves in the village of Harina.
On 30 April 2000, Matlab Uttar Upazila, an archipelago surrounded by the Meghna-Dhanagoda river, started its journey as an independent upazila with 1 municipality and 13 unions (later 1 increase). Later on 5th September of the same year Matlab North started functioning as a newly created upazila. As the adjoining Matlab upazila is on the north side, this upazila was named Matlab Uttar.

Hermogenes (; fl. 5th–4th century BC) was an ancient Athenian philosopher best remembered as a close friend of Socrates as depicted by Plato and Xenophon.
Life
Hermogenes was the son of Hipponicus, brother of the wealthy Callias, and resident of the Alopece deme alongside Socrates. Although he belonged to the great family of Callias, he is mentioned by Xenophon as a man of very little property, suggesting that he may have been an illegitimate son of Hipponicus. Plato, on the other hand, suggests that he was unjustly deprived of his property by Callias, his brother.
He is an interlocutor in Plato's Cratylus dialogue, where he maintains that all the words of a language were formed by an agreement of people amongst themselves. Xenophon cites Hermogenes as his source on the trial of Socrates in his Apology, and Plato includes Hermogenes in the list of individuals present at Socrates' execution. Diogenes Laërtius states that he was one of the teachers of Plato, but this claim does not appear elsewhere in the surviving literature.

Santa Maria de Jetibá is the name of a municipality and of its capital in central Espírito Santo, Southeastern Brazil. It was founded in 1857 by Pomeranian immigrants who arrived through the state capital Vitória by going up the river Santa Maria.
Geography
Located in the south-central mountain region of Espírito Santo, this municipality has an area of 735.55 square kilometers. The town of Santa Maria de Jetibá is 720 meters above sea level, and the highest point in the state is Garrafão Peak, at 1200 meters (3937 ft) above sea level.
People
With a total population of 41,015 (2020), Santa Maria de Jetibá is considered one of the last significant East Pomeranian-speaking communities in the world. Those immigrants (Pomeranians), who came from the historical region Pomerania, now part of Germany and Poland where it is known as Pommern and Pomorze respectively.
In Brazil, many Pomeranians also established communities in Santa Catarina (see Pomerode) and Rio Grande do Sul (see Arroio do Padre). Santa Maria de Jetibá is a place where the people still speak solely East Pomeranian in their day-to-day life. Due to the isolation of this community, most of the members of the community live in very poor conditions. Due also to financial constraints by the state, very little investment in education is forthcoming, and the language barrier persists to be a real problem for the community. This also hinders their future prospects, of course, by them not having proper education, thus a reasonable expectation in the work market. Those communities are mainly rural.
Demography
Most of the population of that city is descended from Pomeranian and German peoples.
East Pomeranian, a dialect of Low German, has co-official status in Santa Maria de Jetibá.
Source: 2010 Census
Climate
Santa Maria de Jetibá is on a high valley and the altitude of this Town is about 700m above the sea level. The elevation of this municipality changes the climate and it features a cool and dry climate on winters and an wet and hot days and cool nights on summers. Santa Maria de Jetibá features a humid subtropical climate type Cwa.

The Tiber Rocks are a group of rocks lying near the head of Rymill Bay, close west of the mouth of Romulus Glacier and northwest of the highest summit of Black Thumb, off the west coast of Graham Land. First seen and roughly surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Riddoch Rymill, it was resurveyed in 1948-49 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), and so named by them because of the association of these rocks with nearby Romulus and Remus Glaciers.

Daphney Hlomuka (1949 – 1 October 2008) was a South African television, film, radio and stage actress. On the small screen, Hlomuka was perhaps best known to audiences for her role as MaMkhize (Mrs Mhlongo) in the television drama series, Hlala Kwabafileyo, and as Sis May in the comedy, S'gudi S'naysi, opposite Joe Mafela.
Hlomuka was born in Durban, South Africa, but raised in KwaMashu during the Apartheid era. She began acting in the theater in Durban in 1968, and was considered to be a protégé of the Durban-based playwright, Welcome Msomi. Her earliest theater credits included performances in two of Msomi's theatrical productions: Qombeni and Umabatha, which was a Zulu adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Umabatha became one of Msomu's most famous works. Hlomuka worked in Zulu-language radio plays in the interim between Qombeni and Umabatha.
She left South Africa briefly during the 1970s to tour with the cast of Ipi Tombi in Europe. During the 1960s and 1970s, roles on screen or stage for black actors in South Africa were often difficult to find due to Apartheid. Hlomuka often appeared off-screen as a radio actor in several popular Zulu drama series.
Hlomuka finally had success on South African television during the 1980s when she was cast in the role of MaMhlongo in the dramatic television series, Hlala Kwabafileyo. Her character, MaMhlongo, was the wife and widow of a wealthy tycoon. To this day in South Africa, the word MaMgobhozi, which originated from the series and Ruth Cele's character, describes the gossip habits attributed to women.
She also appeared in the 1980s television comedy, S'gudi S'naysi, opposite well known actor, Joe Mafela. Mafela portrayed the tenant, S'dumo. Hlomuka's character, Sis May, was S'dumo's well-intentioned, tolerant landlady. The series was popular during its run.
Hlomuka's film and television credits spanned the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s (decade). She appeared in the 1995 film, Soweto Green as a maid and housekeeper named Tryphina, opposite actor John Kani. She also starred as Queen Ntombazi in the 1986 South African television miniseries, Shaka Zulu. She also starred on the SABC 1 series Gugu no Andile, as her aunt. She also appeared in the 1996 syndicated television series, Tarzan: The Epic Adventures.
Her most recent roles included Rhythm City, as well as a controversial Nguni language adaptation of the Shakespearean romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet.
Daphney Hlomuka died of kidney cancer at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Johannesburg on 1 October 2008, at the age of 59. She was survived by her husband, Elliot Ngubane, and their four children.

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PMAIP1 gene, and is also known as Noxa.
Noxa (Latin for damage) is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Bcl-2 family members can form hetero- or homodimers, and they act as anti- or pro-apoptotic regulators that are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. The expression of Noxa is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, and Noxa has been shown to be involved in p53-mediated apoptosis.
Interactions
Noxa has been shown to interact with:
BCL2-like 1,
Bcl-2, and
MCL1.

Marxist aesthetics is a theory of aesthetics based on, or derived from, the theories of Karl Marx. It involves a dialectical and materialist, or dialectical materialist, approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, and so forth. Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics. For instance, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, who greatly influenced the art of the early Soviet Union, followed the secular humanism of Ludwig Feuerbach more than he followed Marx.
Marxist aesthetics overlaps with the Marxist theory of art. It is particularly concerned with art practice, with the prescribing of artistic standards that are deemed socially beneficial. This materialist and socialist orientation may be seen to invoke the traditional aims of scientific inquiry and the scientific method.
Some notable Marxist aestheticians of varying tendencies include Anatoly Lunacharsky, Andrei Zhdanov, Mikhail Lifshitz, William Morris, Theodor W. Adorno, Bertolt Brecht, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Antonio Gramsci, Georg Lukács, Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson, Louis Althusser, Jacques Rancière, Adolfo Sánchez Vázquez, Pierre Macherey, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Raymond Williams. Roland Barthes must also be mentioned here.
Not all of these figures are solely concerned with aesthetics: in many cases, Marxist aesthetics forms only an important branch of their work, depending on how one defines the term. For example, a Marxist aesthetic may be latent in Brecht's work, but he formulated his own distinct theory of art and its social purpose.
One of the chief concerns of Marxist aesthetics is to unite Marx and Engels' social and economic theory, or theory of the social base, to the domain of art and culture, the superstructure. These two terms, base and superstructure, became an important dichotomy in The German Ideology (1846), which however was not published during their lifetimes. Likewise Marx's early Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, which, though widely regarded as important for treating the themes of sensuousness and alienation, first appeared only in 1932 (the slated 1846 publication was canceled) and in English only in 1959. The manuscripts were therefore unknown to art theorists during, for instance, the often antagonistic debates on art in the early Soviet Union between the constructivist avant garde and the proponents of socialist realism. The controversy over the unusual design of the original documents adds another twist.
Many theorists touch upon important themes of Marxist aesthetics without strictly being Marxist aestheticians, Joel Kovel, for instance, has extended the concepts of Marxian ecology which deeply implicates aesthetics. He is also a part of the struggle to bridge the space between Marx and Freud, which has Marxist aesthetics as a central concern. Current themes within the field include research on the effect of mass-produced industrial materials on the sensed environment, such as paints and colors. A strong current within the field involves linguistics and semiotics, and arguments over structuralism and post-structuralism, modernism and post-modernism, as well as feminist theory.
Visual artists, as diverse as Isaak Brodsky or Diego Rivera and Kasimir Malevich or Lyubov Popova, for example, for whom written theory is secondary, nevertheless may be said to be connected to Marxist aesthetics through their production of art, without necessarily declaring themselves aestheticians or Marxists in writing. Likewise, in this spirit Oscar Wilde, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Orson Welles, Jean-Luc Godard, Pablo Picasso, Richard Paul Lohse, for example. Such a view could apply to many visual and other artists in many fields, even those who have no apparent and/or voiced connection to Marxist politics or even those ostensibly opposed; in this respect consider Anton Webern.
Probably it would be fair to say that two of the most influential writings in Marxist aesthetics in recent times, and apart from Marx himself and Lukacs, have been Walter Benjamin's essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, and Herbert Marcuse's One-Dimensional Man. Louis Althusser has also contributed some small but significant essays on art and his theory of ideology also impacts in this area ("Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses").
The field remains polemical, with camps of modernists, post modernists, anti modernists, the avant garde, constructivists, and socialist realists all referencing back to an ostensible Marxist aesthetic theory that would underpin their art practices by grounding an art theory.

The Rawang people are an ethnic group who inhabit far northern Kachin State of Burma (Myanmar). They speak the Rawang language.
There are one D'rung family and several Anung families found among Lisu tribe people in Arunachal Pradesh in India. However, Nung rawang people and Anung (Lisu) people are two different groups. Anung people speak and write in their own language. The Anung population mixed with Lisu tribe people in China is estimated about 20000. According to cultural research and their own oral traditions, the Nung-Rawang are most likely Mongolian descendants who moved south from the Mongolian steppes to the 3 river region (Mekong, Yantzi, Salween)of China. During the second millennium, the Nung-Rawang migrated south west into the Himalayas at the top of Burma, seeking fertile farm lands. They settled in some of the most remote valleys and mountains in all of Burma. The Nung-Rawang are a proud, peaceful, industrious, agriculturally based mountain people known for their stability, hospitality, and colourful traditions. Living in the beautiful and isolated regions of northern Burma, they have also become prosperous through the plentiful supplies of jade and gold in their region. During the British colonial period, their very existence was thought to be a myth, as incoherent reports of "pygmy tribes" in the mountains of north Burma surfaced from time to time. The Drung, a sub tribe of the Nung-Rawang are short in stature, and are known for their crossbow hunting skills, and an extensive anthropological study has been initiated on this remote ethnic group by Dr. P. Christiaan Klieger of the California Academy of Sciences, since 2001.

Unity in diversity is used as an expression of harmony and unity between dissimilar individuals or groups. It is a concept of "unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation" that shifts focus from unity based on a mere tolerance of physical, cultural, linguistic, social, religious, political, ideological and/or psychological differences towards a more complex unity based on an understanding that difference enriches human interactions. The idea and related phrase is very old and dates back to ancient times in both Western and Eastern Old World cultures. It has applications in many fields, including ecology, cosmology, philosophy, religion and politics.
Origins
The concept of unity in diversity can be traced back to Sufi philosopher Ibn al-'Arabi (1165–1240), who advanced the metaphysical concept of the "oneness of being" (wahdat al-wujud), namely, that reality is one, and that God's is the only true existence; all other beings are merely shadows, or reflections of God's qualities. Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī (1366–1424) expanded on Al-'Arabi's work, using it to describe a holistic view of the universe which reflects "unity in diversity and diversity in unity" (al-wahdah fi'l-kathrah wa'l-kathrah fi'l-wahdah).
Leibniz used the phrase as a definition of "harmony" (Harmonia est unitas in varietate) in his Elementa verae pietatis, sive de amore dei 948 I.12/A VI.4.1358. Leibniz glosses the definition Harmonia est cum multa ad quandam unitatem revocantur which means the 'Harmony' is when many [things] are restored to some kind of unity.
Religious beliefs
The Old Javanese poem Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular during the reign of the Majapahit empire sometime in the 14th century, contains the phrase Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, translated as "unity in diversity". The poem is notable as it promotes tolerance between Hindus (especially Shaivites) and Buddhists, stating that although Buddha and Shiva are different in substance, their truths are one:
Unity in diversity is a prominent principle of the Baháʼí Faith. In 1938, in his book The World Order of Baháʼu'lláh, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith, said that "unity in diversity" was the "watchword" for the religion.
ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the head of the Baháʼí Faith from 1892 to 1921, explained this principle in terms of the oneness of humanity:
In Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba's Final Declaration, he stated that "Unity in the midst of diversity can be made to be felt only by touching the very core of the heart. This is the work for which I have come. I have come to sow the seed of love in your hearts so that, in spite of all superficial diversity which your life in illusion must experience and endure, the feeling of oneness through love is brought about amongst all the nations, creeds, sects and castes of the world."
Unity in diversity is also a slogan utilized by the disciples of Swami Sivananda. They came to America to spread the true meaning of Unity in Diversity; that we are All in One & One in All in an all loving ahimsa God.
Dutch Christian theologian Herman Bavinck wrote that principles of “unity in diversity” and “diversity in unity” both flow out of the Christian doctrines of the Imago Dei and the Trinity:Every human being, while a member of the body of humanity as a whole, is at the same time a unique idea of God, with a significance and destiny that is eternal! Every human being is himself or herself an image of God, yet that image is only fully unfolded in humanity as a whole!
— Reformed Dogmatics: Volume 2 (Gereformeerde Dogmatiek), 1895-99
[The Trinity] reveals God to us as the fullness of being, the true life, eternal beauty. In God, too, there is unity in diversity, diversity in unity.
— Reformed Dogmatics: Volume 2 (Gereformeerde Dogmatiek), 1895-99Nagar Chaurasi-The Symbolism Of Unity In Diversity Is Inspiring The Whole World.

The phrase has since become somewhat of a staple of Canadian multiculturalism in general.
The phrase was invoked in the Interdisciplinary Research Seminar (IRS) at Wilfrid Laurier University in the 1970s. Ervin Laszlo presented his paper entitled "Framework for a General Systems Theory of World Order" (1974) as one of the first seminar Papers that led to the establishment of the IRS in 1975.

European Union
In 2000, the European Union adopted 'United in Diversity' (Latin: In varietate concordia) as official motto, a reference to the many and diverse member states of the Union in terms of culture. Apart from its English form, the European Union's motto is also official in 23 other languages. "Unity in diversity" was selected by means of a competition involving students from member nations. According to the European Union official website:
India
Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India and leader of the Indian National Congress, vigorously promoted unity in diversity as an ideal essential to national consolidation and progress. He wrote at length on this topic, exploring it in detail in his work The Discovery of India.
Indonesia
Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, an Old Javanese phrase translated as "Unity in Diversity", is the official national motto of Indonesia.
South Africa
When apartheid South Africa celebrated 20 years of independence on 31 May 1981, the theme of the celebrations was "unity in diversity" (). Anti-apartheid campaigners denounced the motto as a cynical attempt to explain away the inequalities in South African life and called on runners of the Comrades Marathon to protest at the co-option of the event by wearing a black armband. The winner of the race, Bruce Fordyce, was one of those wearing a black armband.
The term has since been incorporated into the preamble of the 1996 Constitution of South Africa as a central tenet of post-apartheid South Africa and is currently the national motto.

Death squads in El Salvador () were far-right paramilitary groups acting in opposition to Marxist–Leninist guerrilla forces, most notably of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), and their allies among the civilian population before, during, and after the Salvadoran Civil War. The death squads committed the vast majority of the murders and massacres during the civil war from 1979 to 1992 and were heavily aligned with the United States-backed government.
History
Pre-civil war
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, many political groups arose in opposition to the military government of the National Conciliation Party (PCN). The Christian Democratic Party (PDC) was the chief opponent of the PCN, gaining significant influence in the Legislative Assembly. In the 1972 presidential election, PDC candidate José Napoleón Duarte, under the banner of the National Opposing Union (UNO), was declared to have won the election by 6,000 votes by the Central Election Board, but the result was canceled and the Legislative Assembly voted PCN candidate Arturo Armando Molina as president.Other, less political groups which appeared included the United Front for Revolutionary Action (FUAR), Party of Renovation (PAR), Unitary Syndical Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), and the Christian Federation of Salvadoran Peasants (FECCAS). In order to combat the political and militant opposition to the government, President Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo established the National Democratic Organization (ORDEN). The organization was headed by General José Alberto Medrano and placed under the administration of the National Security Agency of El Salvador (ANSESAL). ORDEN was a group of several governments controlled death squads which were used to arrest and torture political opponents, intimidate voters, rig elections, and kill peasants.Stanley, William. The Protection Racket State Elite Politics, Military Extortion, and Civil War in El Salvador (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1996) ORDEN claimed to have somewhere from 50,000 to 100,000 members at its peak in the late 1960s.
During the civil war
During the Salvadoran Civil War, the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador officially dissolved the National Democratic Organization leaving its paramilitaries to break free and operate independently. The paramilitaries openly targeted members of the FMLN and civilians, notably workers of human rights organizations.
Despite officially having no connecting to the government, the death squads and paramilitaries were almost always soldiers from the Armed Forces of El Salvador, meaning the death squads were indirectly funded and armed by the United States. Further funding also came from right-wing politicians and businessmen.
Post-civil war
During negotiations to end the civil war in what are now the Chapultepec Peace Accords, part of the agreements were that the government of El Salvador would crack down on and suppress the paramilitaries that fought alongside them during the civil war. The accords stated that the government would "[s]uppress paramilitary entities (Civil Defense Patrols)."
Most of the paramilitaries that existed in the country before and during the civil war have since ceased to exist but one notable exception, Sombra Negra, continues to operate in the country, targeting gang members of MS-13 and 18th Street Gang as a form of vigilante justice.
Human rights violations
During the civil war, the paramilitaries, often labeled as death squads, came to public attention when on March 24, 1980, Archbishop of San Salvador Óscar Romero was assassinated while giving Mass. The Salvadoran government investigated but was unable to identify who assassinated Romero. The investigation did identify Major Roberto D'Aubuisson as having ordered the assassination.Anne-Marie O'Connor. "Participant in 1980 assassination of Romero in El Salvador provides new details," Washington Post, 6 April 2010.
The US-trained Atlácatl Battalion of the Salvadoran Army was responsible for committing two of the largest massacres during the civil war: the El Mozote massacre and the El Calabozo massacre.
Sombra Negra tortures their victims, mostly gang members, and kills them with a point-blank shot to the head.

Andrés Henestrosa Morales (November 25, 1906 – January 10, 2008) was a Mexican writer and politician. In addition to his prose and poetry, Henestrosa was elected to the federal legislature, serving three terms in the Chamber of Deputies, and as a senator for the state of Oaxaca from 1982 to 1988. He was born in Ixhuatán, Oaxaca.
Youth and studies
Andrés Henestrosa started studying at Juchitán, Oaxaca. Until he was 15 he only could speak his native language, Zapotec. After finishing his basic education, Henestrosa moved to Mexico City and started studying at the National Teacher's School, where he learned Spanish excellently. Then, he studied at the National High School and after, at the Jurisprudence National School, where he started law studies but he did not graduate. At the same time, he studied at the Philosophy and Literature Faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Around that time (1927) one of his teachers, Alfonso Caso, encouraged what would be the start of his career: he suggested Henestrosa write down Zapotec myths, legends and fables, which formed the basis of his first book, The Men Scattered by Dance, published in 1929.
Henestrosa contributed in many ways to Zapotec culture, keeping a line of investigation and exaltation of it; he also was one of the Mexican exponents of the literary movement called Indianismo, since his first book. He also wrote essays and political documents during his long career.
In 1936, the Guggenheim Foundation gave him a scholarship to investigate about Zapotec culture and visited United States at the linguistic, resulting in Zapotec language phonetization, the adaptation of the Latin alphabet and a Zapotec–Spanish dictionary. During this trip, while in New Orleáns in 1937, he wrote one of his most famous books: My Mother's Portrait ("El retrato de mi madre").
He was a member of the Mexican Language Academy from October 23, 1964, to his death, as numerary member with chair 23. He was the treasurer of the Academy from 1965 to 2000. Andrés Henestrosa was one of the most prominent members of the Mexican intelligentsia.
September 26, 1949
Henestrosa was supposed to be on a DC-3 that crashed on September 26, 1949, killing all 23 onboard. He had a premonition and instead boarded a train from Tapachula, the city he was traveling from, to Mexico City.
Political career
In 1929, he supported (as did many UNAM students) the presidential campaign of José Vasconcelos, being an active part of the campaign acts and writing many essays and chronicles. But almost all of the original hand-wrote transcriptions were lost, being published in many magazines and newspapers.
In 1982 he was elected senator for his home state, Oaxaca, as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

Hans Hermann Hüter (born March 21, 1906, † June 9, 1970 in Huntsville, Alabama) was a German-Swiss rocket engineer.
Being part of the engineering team around Hermann Oberth, Rudolf Nebel and Klaus Riedel (together with Wernher von Braun, Rolf Engel, Hans Bermüller, Paul Ehmayr, Kurt Heinisch and Helmuth Zoike) Hüter was involved in the development, construction and tests of the first rockets powered by liquid gas - initially at the Berlin-Reinickendorf rocket airfield, most recently at the Peenemünde Army Research Center. He was supposed to fly as a passenger in the "Magdeburg pilot rocket" in 1933, but this flight ultimately failed.
After World War II, he was brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, where he worked in the group of Wernher von Braun at Fort Bliss. In 1960 he became head of the Agena and Centaur Systems Office at NASA.

Between each couplet, a complete chorus is sung. In the example below, the sung chorus is given in italics; the other words are the caller's lyrics:
De Lawd, He thought He'd make a man
Dese bones gwine rise again
Made ‘im outa mud an' a han'ful o' san
Dese bones gwine to rise again
(Chorus)
I knowed it Indeed I knowed it, brother
I knowed it Dese bones gwine to rise again
There are several variants of the lyrics; the dramatic and creative talents of the caller generate considerable variation. For one version of the lyrics, see the external link below.

The Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church was established by the Holy See and 14 autocephalous Orthodox churches.
Plenary sessions
The commission's first ten years of work reflected the growing consensus between the two communions and saw the publication of three agreed statements on such issues as the relationship between the Trinity, the Church and Eucharist; the sacraments of initiation and the connection between common faith and sacramental communion; and the theology of the ordained ministry.
The commission has held the following plenary sessions:
1st Patmos & Rhodes, Greece (1980) "The Mystery of the Church and the Eucharist in the Light of the Mystery of the Holy Trinity"
2nd Munich, Germany (June 30 to July 6, 1982) "The Mystery of the Church and the Eucharist in the Light of the Mystery of the Holy Trinity"

Seventh Plenary Session (Balamand, Lebanon)
The seventh plenary session took place from June 17 to 24th, 1993. According to the Communique, also known as the Balamand declaration, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the attendant collapse of the Warsaw Pact in Central and Eastern Europe brought about "profound changes... involving the rebirth of religious liberty and the resumption of open pastoral activity by the Oriental Catholic Churches". The session declared that these changes had "made these questions the touchstone of the quality of the relations between the Catholic and the Orthodox Churches." In particular, the question of Uniatism became the focus of attention.
Eighth Plenary Session (Emmitsburg, United States)
The eighth plenary session took place from July 9 to 19th, 2000 and centered on the theme of the "Ecclesiological and Canonical Implications of Uniatism"

The Ray D'Arcy Show is an Irish chat show presented by Ray D'Arcy. It was first broadcast on RTÉ One on 26 September 2015 and airs on Saturday evenings.
Production
On 7 December 2014 it was announced that D'Arcy was leaving independent commercial radio station Today FM after fourteen years to join state broadcaster RTÉ, with whom he had previously worked. Derek Mooney was making way so D'Arcy could present a daily programme on RTÉ Radio 1. The production of various "television projects" in RTÉ was also mentioned. Speculation immediately turned to what role D'Arcy would have on RTÉ Television, with a quiz show and an Ant and Dec-style evening entertainment being mentioned. D'Arcy himself told the RTÉ Guide it wouldn't be something he was interested in: "When I was in my 30s I would have aspired to doing something like that, but, no, absolutely no desire now." The possibility of D'Arcy hosting a weekend chat show seemed more likely following Brendan O'Connor's announcement on 14 March 2015 that his Saturday Night Show would be coming to an end after five years. D'Arcy later confirmed that he would be taking over O'Connor's prime-time Saturday night slot.
Pre-production of D'Arcy's new Saturday night chat show began in August 2015. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that RTÉ spent €136,000 on the set. This was €24,000 more than was spent on Ryan Tubridy's set when he took over as host of The Late Late Show. The new set was the brainchild of award-winning designer Sinead O'Hanlon.
Series
The first series of 32 shows began at 9:45pm on 26 September 2015. The very first show– which featured guests including Tulisa and Tommy Tiernan – attracted 468,500 viewers, a 35% share of the audience. Ratings for the first show were lower than Brendan O'Connor's final Saturday Night Show, when some 501,900 viewers tuned in - a 38% share. It was also lower than the series average for O'Connor's first season in 2010 which was 463,700 – a 34% share.
The second D'Arcy show lost 107,000 viewers, as people tuned to rival TV3 to watch the 2015 Rugby World Cup game between England and Australia.
D'Arcy's fifth show on 24 October 2015 had an average of 356,000 viewers and a 29% audience share. This was in contrast to the previous nights Late Late Show which had almost twice the audience with 707,000 viewers for its country music special.
Episodes
, The Ray D'Arcy Show has broadcast twelve episodes since its debut on 26 September 2015.

The Kingston Flyer is a vintage steam train in the South Island of New Zealand at the southern end of Lake Wakatipu. It used 14 kilometres of preserved track that once formed a part of the Kingston Branch. Originally, Kingston Flyer was a passenger express train between Kingston, Gore, Invercargill, and less frequently, Dunedin. It was operated by the New Zealand Railways (NZR) from the 1890s to 1957. In 1971, NZR revitalised the service as a tourist venture, later leasing the locomotives and rolling stock in 1982 to a private company. Since then, the Kingston Flyer has been through a number of owners, most recently being owned by the Kingston Flyer Ltd. A group of volunteers has restored the railway, rolling stock and locomotives to service. In July 2021 the Kingston Flyer received resource consent to operate, initially for tour groups.
History
The Kingston Flyer was introduced in the late 1890s as New Zealand recovered from the Long Depression of the 1880s. During the Long Depression, slow mixed trains that carried both passengers and freight had served the Kingston Branch and Waimea Plains Railway, daily in some years and only a few times per week in others. However, as the economy was revitalised, the Railways Department sought to increase services on the two lines. The government acquired the Waimea Plains Railway and incorporated it into the national network. The Kingston Branch ran north–south between Invercargill and Kingston, while the Waimea Plains Railway diverged from the branch in Lumsden and ran eastwards, meeting the Main South Line in Gore. Mixed services operated to a higher frequency, and dedicated passenger trains were introduced. These services came to be known as the Kingston Flyer, especially the Gore-Kingston services across the Waimea Plains.
The Flyer served Kingston every weekday. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it ran Kingston-Gore, where it connected with Main South Line expresses between Dunedin and Invercargill. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it operated Kingston-Invercargill, using the length of the Kingston Branch. In the early years, services were typically operated by K and V class steam locomotives. At peak periods, especially Christmas and Easter, special services had to be operated to cater for demand, with some operating from Dunedin through to Kingston, where they connected with Lake Wakatipu steamboats to the popular holiday destination of Queenstown. For many years, this was the primary means of travelling to Queenstown.
Demise
In the 1930s, passenger numbers declined sharply and the Railways Department looked to cancel its services on the Kingston Branch. That occurred on 4 October 1937, bringing an end to the regular Flyers. Until 17 September 1945, an abbreviated service continued to operate across the Waimea Plain to the Kingston Branch junction in Lumsden. Then, on both lines, the service was replaced by buses operated by the New Zealand Railways Road Services.
That was not the end of the Flyers. The timetables retained a 'runs as required' Kingston Flyer, which typically operated at peak holiday periods between Gore and sometimes Dunedin to Kingston. For many years, those expresses and excursions operated in conjunction with steamers on Lake Wakatipu, to provide the primary access to Queenstown. Patronage was initially heavy, but it declined through the 1950s. 1956 was the last year when Flyers ran each way in the same day, and the final Flyer operated during the 1957 Easter holiday period.
Revitalisation
In 1971, New Zealand Railways announced that it was going to recommence operating a service named the Kingston Flyer as a heritage service. The last use of steam on a regularly scheduled revenue service in New Zealand was on 26 October 1971, and the new Kingston Flyer began operating two months later on 21 December. It utilised the section of the Kingston Branch between Lumsden and Kingston and proved wildly popular. From 1971 until 1979 it operated every summer through to the Easter holiday period and carried over 30,000 people annually. Flooding damage to the line between Lumsden and Garston meant that the last Kingston to Invercargill flyer ran on 17 April 1979 and the damaged section of track in question was formally closed in November of that year. For the next three years, the Kingston Flyer operated from Invercargill to Bluff and Wairio, albeit less successfully.
In 1982, the Kingston Flyer was returned by NZR to Kingston before the remaining line now part of the Mossburn Branch was closed and removed. The initial intention was to utilise the remaining 20 kilometres of track between Garston and Kingston, but the decision was made to end the line in Fairlight and the additional six kilometres to Garston were closed. Although the original Flyers had typically been operated by locomotives of the Rogers K and V classes, two AB class 4-6-2 locomotives, AB 778 and AB 795 were restored specifically for the Kingston Flyer.
The Kingston Flyer normally operated seven months of the year, from 1 October to 30 April. Two trains ran daily, excluding Christmas Day.
In 1992, NZR's successor, New Zealand Rail Limited (Tranz Rail from 1995), acquired Kingston Flyer Limited, which was sold again in 2003 by Toll NZ, then owners of Tranz Rail, to a private operator.
2009 bankruptcy
In November 2008 the operation was offered for sale at $3 million as a going concern. In late August 2009 it was announced that the train would not operate again in the foreseeable future as mounting debt had forced the operation to close. Kingston Acquisitions tried to sell the train in November 2008 to repay about $4.7 million to Christchurch-based finance company Prudential.
Prudential blocked an initial offer by United States-based company Railmark to buy the operation for $2.25m, the insurers refusing to accept anything less than the whole debt being cleared. Invercargill-based enthusiast Karl Barkley formed the Kingston Flyer Steam Train Trust to preserve the Flyer under the auspices of a charitable trust but was unable to raise the necessary funds to purchase the Flyer from Prudential.
In November 2009, the Flyer's owners were put into receivership and the train itself put up for sale.
In 2011 business was listed on the internet auction site TradeMe for sale with a price of NZD$2.5 million. That included the locomotives, all land associated with the railway, including the Kingston and Fairlight stations, and parts of the Kingston wharf, and several other development sites in Kingston which were not related to the railway. The business was purchased in August 2011 by businessman David Bryce who put it back in operation on 29 October 2011.
In December 2012 the Kingston Flyer was again suspended, due to the discovery of leaks in AB 778's boiler and owner David Bryce's ongoing health problems. The train resumed operation once the extensive overhaul of AB 795 was finished, and the business was once again put up for sale. As at December 2013 no offers had been accepted and the operation remained mothballed, the owner suggested that the Kingston Flyer could be put into a trust.
On 23 February 2017 it was announced that the Kingston Flyer and all associated land and buildings had been sold to a local consortium. Within two months it became apparent that the buyers were interested only in the land that the train runs on. Development West Coast said it was interested in buying the infrastructure and running the train on the West Coast railway network.
On 22 December 2017, it was announced that the train would remain in Kingston, and it was hoped that one AB class locomotive would
be operational by February 2018.
In January 2018, the Mountain Scene newspaper announced that the land of the Kingston Flyer operation would be sold off for property development, but in early February 2018, it was reported that the new owners had "big plans" for the train. At the end of 2018, it was reported that a new operator planned to restart the service "within a year".
Current status
At the start of 2020, it was reported that the train would be back in service at some time during the year. In May 2020 the new owners stated that their intention to restore the service by Summer 2020. In January 2021 the company applied for an operating consent to run trains again, but stated that it had no timeframe for when that might happen. In April 2021 the Kingston Flyer ran trains as part of Great Southern Train Tour, and in July the operation gained resource consent to operate. Initially the train will run only for group bookings during the 2021/2022 summer season, and will not run to a fixed schedule. Director of the Kingston Flyer Limited, Neville Simpson, stated that the train may run for the public on Sundays "as the engine's still warm."
Locomotives and rolling stock
The Kingston Flyer has been operated since 1971 by two AB class steam locomotives:
AB 778 (entered service in 1925)
AB 795 (entered service in 1927 and once pulled the New Zealand Royal Train)
From 2000 until 2003, K 92, a preserved member of the Rogers K class that headed the original Flyers, was based in Kingston and operated services both by itself and together with the AB engines. The locomotive was owned by the Waimea Plains Railway Trust and returned briefly during 2008-09 until the bankruptcy when it was recovered by the WPRT and moved to their base at Mandeville on the old Waimea Plains Railway in November that year and where it remains to date.
The Flyer also has a resident shunting locomotive, TR 350, a 15-tonne 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotive built by A & G Price of the Thames. This duty had been filled since the 1990s by 0-6-0DM DSA 551, which was recalled by Tranz Rail in 1999 and replaced by the smaller TR. The TR was used to shunt at Kingston and provide motive power for work trains during the winter shutdown. It remains there with the other locomotives and rolling stock in the compound.
Initially, the Flyer started out with seven wooden-bodied passenger carriages:
An eighth carriage was added by Tranz Rail in 1999. 56-foot steel-panelled passenger carriage A 1958 (TMS A 56595), a former mainline passenger carriage, was transferred from the Tranz Scenic carriage pool to the Kingston Flyer to bolster capacity. That was the only new rolling stock to have been added to the fleet since 1971 when the heritage Flyer began running. It is the most modern carriage in the fleet, although it is out of place with the other carriages.
This carriage was sold separately in 2015, and now can be seen on Huntingdon Street, where the new owners have placed it on a property just down from the railway line.
The Flyer also has a small collection of goods wagons, including three ballast wagons and an EP class plough van. The majority of the goods stock is used for Way and Works purposes, although there are three flat wagons used around the Kingston locomotive depot for maintenance purposes, primarily to hold locomotive parts.

SNMNMNM is a band that formed in Rochester, New York, US, in 1997. The group's name is a condensation of "Seamus 'n Matt 'n Mark 'n Matt". While completing music degrees at the Eastman School of Music, the band members got together to play outside of their studies in an alternative music band, performing several shows at Java's, a coffee shop directly adjacent to Eastman. Blending traditional brass instruments (like tuba, trombone, and trumpet) with electronics, the band self-released their first album and toured before relocating to Los Angeles in 2002. Media attention built as the band released an EP in 2002 and a full-length in 2003, continuing to tour behind the records. Their album, As Best As We Can reach #65 on the CMJ charts and was covered by The New York Times. All of the songs on As Best As We Can feature exclamation points in their titles. Their newest album, Crawl Inside Your Head was released on September 18, 2007.
For a very short time in Rochester, drummer Chris Vatalaro (another graduate of Eastman and original drummer for the band "Jerseyband") played drums for SNMNMNM.

Teochew Romanization, also known as Swatow Church Romanization, or locally Pe̍h-ūe-jī (, literally "Vernacular orthography"), is an orthography similar to Pe̍h-ōe-jī used to write the Chaoshan dialect (including the Teochew dialect and Swatow dialect). It was introduced by John Campbell Gibson and William Duffus, two British missionaries, to Swatow in 1875.
History
Romanization of Teochew can be traced back to the 1840s. The earliest attempt to write the language in the Latin script was undertaken by Baptist missionary William Dean in his 1841 publication First Lessons in the Tie-chiw Dialect published in Bangkok, Thailand; however, his tonal system was said to be incomplete.
The first complete orthographic system was devised by John Campbell Gibson and William Duffus, two Presbyterianism missionaries, in 1875. The orthography was generally based on the Pe̍h-ōe-jī system, another work of presbyterian origin devised for the Amoy dialect. The first translation of the Gospel of Luke in Swatow romanization was published in 1876. It has been said that the vernacular orthographic system is easier for illiterate persons to learn in their own mother tongue.
Besides Gibson and Duffus's original romanization system, several variations of the system were later devised, such as those by William Ashmore (1884) and Lim Hiong Seng (1886).
Other systems developed by Baptist missionaries such as Adele Marion Fielde (1883) and Josiah Goddard (1888) were generally used as a means of phonetic notation instead of a full orthographic system.
Through the church's use of the romanization system, the number of users of the system grew and came to its high point in the 1910s. However, starting in the 1920s, the Chinese government promoted education in Mandarin and more people learned to read and write in Chinese characters. Thus, the promotion of romanized vernacular writing become less necessary. By the 1950s, there were an estimated one thousand users of the system remaining in the Chaoshan area.
Spelling schemes
Alphabet
The orthography uses 18 letters of the basic Latin alphabet.
Initial
The onset in Teochew are listed as below:
The latin alphabets in the table represent the onset with its pronunciation in IPA, followed by the example of Chinese word and its translation in Teochew romanization.
The affricate consonants ts/ch, tsh/chh, and z/j are three allophone pairs where those voiced and voiceless alveolar affricate will shift to voiced and voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate correspondingly when they meet with close or close-mid front vowels (i, e).
Finals
The rhymes used in the orthography are listed below:
The latin alphabet sets in the table represent the spelling of syllable final in the system with its pronunciation in IPA, followed by the example of Chinese word and its translation in Teochew romanization.
Nowadays, in most part of Chaoshan cities, almost all alveolar-codas (-n/-t) have shifted to velar (-ng/-k), therefore, they are unseen in the 1960's Peng'im system. However, these codas are still present among native speakers particularly in few border townships like Fenghuang (), Sanrao (), and Nan'ao.
Tones
There are 8 tones in Teochew and mark as below,
Both first and fourth tones are unmarking but both could be differenced by their coda-endings: those ending with stop consonants such as -p, -t, -k, and -h are belonged to the fourth, and those simple and nasal vowels, or ending in nasal consonants (-m, -n, -ng), are belonged to the first.
The tone sandhi is not marked in the writing system but only apply in the reading. Basically, for any phrase that more than one word (a syllable), sandhi applied to all words except the last one in each phrase.
For example, in Swatow dialect, will be pronounced as where all words in the term are in their own sandhi except the last word .

Eric Abraham (born March 1954) is a South African-British producer and former journalist and activist. Born and raised in South Africa, he moved to England in 1977 where he lived in exile for 15 years for his reporting in opposition to the Apartheid government in the press. He has since worked in theatre and screen, co-founding the London-based Portobello Productions as well as Cape Town's Isango Portobello and Fugard Theatre.
Early life
Abraham was born in the Wynberg area of Cape Town and grew up in Rondebosch. His father was a naval commander who had arrived in South Africa from Hungary before World War II to escape antisemitism. Abraham attended South African College High School. He participated in school productions and ran a film society. He later received a Spectemur Agendo Award from the school in 2019 for his contributions to civil liberties and the performing arts.
Abraham studied Law at the University of Cape Town, but has said he was "hardly ever at lectures because there was something more important in those days" as a student union leader and activist. He began his career in journalism, setting up the South African News Agency (SANA) as a correspondent on human rights abuses and black politics in South Africa for the foreign press such as the BBC and The Guardian. He was placed under a five-year banning order and house arrest by the Apartheid government in 1976 for his reporting. After receiving death threats, Abraham secretly fled to Botswana with external help in January 1977. He could not return to his home country until Apartheid ended, and was granted political asylum in the UK. He landed a job as a producer for BBC Panorama.

Clara Jacobo (c. 1898 – 23 June 1966, Naples) was an Italian opera singer. She began her career around 1923 at the Italian provincial stages.

The Old People's Home, presently known as Leo Vaughan Senior Manor, is located at 3325 Fontenelle Boulevard in the Florence neighborhood on the north side of Omaha, Nebraska. Built in 1917, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
History
The Old People's Home was initiated by the Women's Christian Aid Association, one of Omaha's first private charitable organizations. Founded in 1883, the women's group raised funds to construct the two-story brick building in 1917. The building was converted from a nonprofit home to a residential retirement center in 1988.

The Military Health System (MHS) is a form of nationalized health care operated within the United States Department of Defense that provides health care to active duty, Reserve component and retired U.S. Military personnel and their dependents.
The missions of the MHS are complex and interrelated:
To ensure America's 1.4 million active duty and 331,000 reserve-component personnel are healthy so they can complete their national security missions.
To ensure that all active and reserve medical personnel in uniform are trained and ready to provide medical care in support of operational forces around the world.
To provide a medical benefit commensurate with the service and sacrifice of more than 9.5 million active duty personnel, military retirees and their families.
The MHS also provides health care, through the TRICARE health plan, to:
active duty service members and their families,
retired service members and their families,
Reserve component members and their families,
surviving family members,
Medal of Honor recipients and their families
some former spouses, and
others identified as eligible in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.
Such care has been made available since 1966, (with certain limitations and co-payments), through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and now through the TRICARE health plan. In October 2001, TRICARE benefits were extended to retirees and their dependents aged 65 and over. On Oct. 1, 2013, the Defense Health Agency replaced the TRICARE Management Activity.
The MHS has a $50+ billion budget and serves approximately 9.5 million beneficiaries. The actual cost of having a government-run health care system for the military is higher because the wages and benefits paid for military personnel who work for the MHS and the retirees who formerly worked for it, is not included in the budget. The MHS employs more than 144,217 in 51 hospitals, 424 clinics, 248 dental clinics and 251 veterinary facilities across the nation and around the world, as well as in contingency and combat-theater operations worldwide.
History
Before the Civil War, medical care in the military was provided largely by the regimental surgeon and surgeons' mates. While attempts were made to establish a centralized medical system, care provision was largely local and limited. Treatment for disease and injury was, by modern standards, primitive.
The Civil War saw improvements in medical science, communications and transportation that made centralized casualty collection and treatment more practical.
In World War I, the U.S. Army Medical Department expanded and developed its organization and structure. Care began on the battlefield and was then transferred to successively better levels of medical capability. Much of this capability was located in the combat theater so that soldiers could be easily returned to duty if possible.
Expansion continued during World War II, but without the benefit of an organizational plan.
After World War II, the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government was reorganized. The Department of War and Department of the Navy were merged into a single Department of Defense (DOD). This caused friction between the Army and Navy medical corps. Furthermore, the Air Force, originally part of the Army, was created as a separate military service with its own separate Medical Service.
Changes in the perception of health care after World War II and an assessment of medical services provided to dependents caused Congress to re-evaluate the dependent health care benefit in the late 1950s. Changes in tax law had induced business and industry to begin offering a health care benefit as an employment incentive. A 1956 Department of Defense estimate was that 40 percent of active duty dependents did not have access to federal facilities due to distance, incomplete medical coverage at the federal facility, or due to the saturation of services at military treatment facilities. Congress responded by passing the Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 and the Military Medical Benefits Amendments of 1966. These acts created the program known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).
In the late 1980s, because of escalating costs, claims paperwork demands and general beneficiary dissatisfaction, DOD launched a series of demonstration projects. Under a program known as the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI), a contractor provided both health care and administrative-related services, including claims processing. The CRI project was one of the first to introduce managed care features to the CHAMPUS program. Beneficiaries under CRI were offered three choices: a health maintenance organization-like option called CHAMPUS Prime that required enrollment and offered better benefits and low-cost shares, a preferred provider organization-like option called CHAMPUS Extra that required use of network providers in exchange for lower cost shares, and the standard CHAMPUS option that continued the freedom of choice in selecting providers and higher cost shares and deductibles.
Although DOD's initial intent under CRI was to award three competitively bid contracts covering six states, it received only one bid, from Foundation Health Corporation (now Health Net) covering California and Hawaii. Foundation delivered services under this contract between August 1988 and January 1994.
In late 1993, driven by requirements in the DoD Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1994, DoD announced plans to implement by May 1997 a nationwide managed care program for the MHS. Under this program, known as TRICARE, the United States would be divided into 12 health care regions. An administrative organization, the lead agent, was designated for each region and coordinated the health care needs of all military treatment facilities in each region. Under TRICARE, seven managed care support contracts were awarded covering DoD's 12 health care regions.
TRICARE has been restructured several times, with contract regions having been redrawn , Base Realignment and Closure, and by adding "TRICARE For Life" benefits in 2001 for those who are Medicare-eligible, and "TRICARE Reserve Select" in 2005.
Coverage gaps
As of 2010, about 1.3 million of the 12.5 million nonelderly veterans in the United States did not have health insurance coverage or access to Veterans Affairs (VA) health care, according to a 2012 report by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that used 2010 data from the Census Bureau and the 2009 and 2010 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). The report also found that:
When family members of veterans are included, the uninsured total rises to 2.3 million.
An additional 900,000 veterans use VA health care but have no other coverage.
Uninsured veterans are more likely to be male (90%), non-Hispanic white (70%), unmarried (58%) and earned a high school degree (41%).
More than 40% are younger than 45.
The US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, has provisions intended to make it easier for uninsured veterans to obtain coverage. Under the act, veterans with incomes at or below 138% of the Federal Poverty Line ($30,429 for a family of four in 2010) would qualify for coverage as of January 2014; this group constitutes nearly 50% of veterans who are currently uninsured. Another 40.1% of veterans and 49% of their families have incomes that qualify for new subsidies through health insurance exchanges with the PPACA.
Additionally, most Tricare plans are currently exempt from conforming to the new healthcare laws under the PPACA. Several bills have been proposed since the PPACA was enacted in 2010, including the most recent S. 358, "Access to Contraception for Women Servicemembers and Dependents Act of 2015" sponsored by Senior Senator from New Hampshire Jeanne Shaheen. Under most current Tricare plans (with the exception of Prime), the health benefit is not considered "insurance" and does not cover women's contraceptives at 100% with no cost-sharing, deductibles, or co-payments.
Female military servicemembers and female dependents of servicemembers continue to pay out of pocket for contraceptive services they receive at civilian doctor's offices under plans such as Tricare Standard, where the services are not rendered at a Military Treatment Facility by DoD doctors or contractors. However, The Military Health System, The Defense Health Agency, and Tricare all advertise that they meet the "minimum essential coverage" standard for all military servicemembers. Additionally, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service reports for servicemembers to the Internal Revenue Service each year that every Tricare-eligible servicemember has a health benefit that meets the requirements of "minimum essential coverage", even though Tricare coverage does not meet the standards of minimum essential coverage.
Components
Led by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the Military Health System includes several core organizational areas including:
Defense Health Agency (DHA)
Joint Staff Surgeon
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS)
Military Treatment Facilities
The MHS also includes the medical departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and TRICARE-authorized providers (including private sector healthcare providers, hospitals and pharmacies).

Berzelius is a lunar impact crater located in the northeast part of the Moon's near side. It lies to the southeast of the crater Franklin, and to the northwest of Geminus.
Berzelius is a low, eroded formation with a fairly level interior floor and a small, ridge-like rim. There are several tiny craterlets along the rim, and the wall is nearly gone along the southern side – it consists of little more than a low, wide ridge. The interior floor is marked by a few tiny craterlets.
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Berzelius.

Julian Charles Porteous (born 5 June 1949) is the Catholic Archbishop of Hobart, Tasmania. He was previously Auxiliary Bishop of Sydney, Australia, Episcopal Vicar for Renewal and Evangelisation, and Titular Bishop of Urusi (2003–2013).
Porteous was installed as Archbishop of Hobart on 17 September 2013.
In 2015 Porteous distributed a booklet to 12,000 families with children in Catholic schools across Tasmania entitled "Don't Mess With Marriage" - the Catholic position on marriage. The booklet argued of gay men and women that "pretending that their relationships are ‘marriages' is not fair or just to them." There were calls by activists for others to refer the Archbishop to the Australian Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. Following 6 months of deliberations, the complaint was withdrawn without a finding.
It has been reported that, "The real problem with the Porteous case was that it was unresolved".

Books in English
His first book to be translated into English is Dispersing Powers: Social Movements as Anti-State Forces (AK Press, 2010).
His book "The New Brazil - Regional Imperialism and the New Democracy" (AK Press, 2014) has also been translated into English by Ramor Ryan.
About this book John Holloway comments in the foreword:
"Zibechi goes to Bolivia to learn. Like us, he goes with questions, questions that stretch far beyond the borders of Bolivia. How do we change the world and create a different one? How do we get rid of capitalism? How do we create a society based on dignity? What is the role of the state and what are the possibilities of changing society through anti-state movements?... the most important practical and theoretical questions that have risen from the struggles in Latin America and the world in the last fifteen years or so.... The book is beautiful, exciting, stimulating.... Do read it and also give it your friends."
And Michael Hardt, co-author of Empire, Multitude, and Commonwealth, writes: "Raúl Zibechi recounts in wonderful detail how dynamic and innovative Bolivian social movements succeeded in transforming the country. Even more inspiring than the practical exploits, though, are the theoretical innovations of the movements, which Zibechi highlights, giving us new understandings of community, political organization, institution, and a series of other concepts vital to contemporary political thought."
His second book published in English is Territories in Resistance. A Cartography of Latin American Social Movements, (AK Press, 2012).
James C. Scott, author of The Art of Not Being Governed (2009) writes: "Zibechi show us not only that new worlds are possible but they exist and are constantly being invented in daily struggles throughout Latin America. A brilliantly original reformulation of the practices of popular action by a sophisticated, realistic, experienced, and daring observer of autonomous non-state spaces. More valuable than a 'six-foot shelf' of tomes on social movement theory".

Herman Slater (1938 – July 9, 1992) was an American Wiccan high priest and occult-bookstore proprietor as well as an editor, publisher, and author. He died of AIDS in 1992.
Early life
Slater was born in 1938 in a lower-middle-class Jewish neighborhood of New York City. At a very early age, he became aware of anti-Semitism . This became one of the influences that led him to witchcraft. Slater studied business administration at New York University, liberal arts at Hunter College and traffic management at the Traffic Management Institute in New York. He also completed a full course at the United States Navy Personnel School at United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge. During 1958 through 1969, Slater had several business jobs in management, traffic expediting, and insurance claims investigation. 1969 marked the beginning of significant health-related issues for him. He was later forced to quit work due to bone tuberculosis, which cost him a hip bone and three years of recuperation.
Transition to witchcraft
During his recuperation process, Slater began experiencing and reading about paranormal phenomena, including divination (tarot cards), clairvoyance, and levitation. He spent an entire year lying in bed in a body cast that weighed 300 pounds. Then one morning, he awoke to find himself stretched across a chair on the opposite side of the room while still in his body cast. These experiences led him to witchcraft, and in 1972 He met Eddie Buczynski (Lord Gwyddion), and they partnered in the Warlocke Shoppe, on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights. It was there that two witches from England gave them the Welsh Tradition Book of Shadows and Herman and Eddie self
initiated. Slater took the name Lord Govannon, and Eddie Lord Gwyddion. Eddie later made trips to Egypt and became part of an all male Minoan magic group in New York. Some of the original members of the coven Herman and Eddie formed left to form their own group. among these were authors Denny Sargent, who with Robert Carey, were co editors of a magazine for aspiring teen magicians called Mandragore. They and other members of the original coven moved on to ceremonial magic, and subscribed to an Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) correspondence course that was based out of London in the mid seventies. In 1977, the O.T.O. came to Slater's Magickal Childe, his new location in Manhattan's Chelsea.
Career
Bucznski and Slater opened The Warlock Shoppe, the oldest witchcraft bookshop in Brooklyn, New York. Buczynski was the more magical and spiritual of the two and left the business side to Slater, who helped the shop grow in profit. Most importantly, the shop established itself as the central information hub for local witches and the newly emerging neopagan communities. The two also published a periodical called Earth Religion News. It was extremely successful but also caused controversy due to its explicit contents and cover designs. In 1974, Slater was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition and assumed leadership of the coven in the late 1970s. The Warlock Shoppe later moved to West 19th Street in Manhattan (the borough of New York City) and operated under the name Magickal Childe. The Magickal Childe functioned as a major focal point for the neopagan community in the 1970s and well into the 1990s. In the later 1980s it gained something of a mercenary reputation being willing to put 'curses' on people for a price. With Slater's death they started having trouble making ends meet and several significant new age publishers stopped providing them with books. The brick and mortar store finally closed in 1999.
Scandals
In 1972, Slater presented the Inquisitional Bigot of the Year award to NBC during a guest appearance on the Today show, for an episode of Macmillan and Wife that had taken witchcraft and corrupted it into devil-worship rituals for the plot. The crew of Today had Slater physically removed from the set. More controversy surrounding Slater's actual proficiency in the types of magick he claimed to practice, accusations that he plagiarized material, yelling out at irritable customers in his Magickal Childe store, "Get out of my store...", as well as outrage over other behaviors he exhibited earned him the nickname "Horrible Herman".
Works
Slater wrote the books:
Introduction to Witchcraft, ,
The Hoodoo Bible,
A Book of Pagan Rituals I & II,
Pagan Rituals III,
Published:
Earth Religion News magazine
Edited:
The Magickal Formulary Spellbook, ,
The Magickal Formulary Spellbook II,
These two witchcraft cookbooks are based on the inner workings of his shop and formulas of his potions. They are sold worldwide and are well-respected within the witchcraft community. The Magickal Childe now continues with an Internet presence.
Educating others
Educating people on the subject of witchcraft became an important mission for Slater. He frequently lectured as a guest speaker at many colleges. He starred in his own video, An Introduction to Witchcraft and Satanism, in which he wore ceremonial robes and headdresses typical of witchcraft. He also appeared with his familiar companion, a snake named Herman. He also hosted a weekly cable show which aired in Manhattan, called The Magickal Mystery Tour. The show featured interviews, rituals, music, occultism, and magick instruction. He thought of the show as an Earth religion 700 Clubs because it spread the word on the Old Religion and asked for donations.
Philosophy
Herman Slater considered Wicca to be an earth religion. In the early days of the Warlocke Shop he hosted The Pagan Way lectures, usually in a coven members apartment and sometimes his own on Atlantic Avenue. The Pagan Way ran the gammit, embracing the various pre-Christian religions and paranormal. Some of the Pagan Way lecturers promoted their works, including Dr. Leo Martello. Herman was tolerant of quite a lot, but would rein in adult activities if he expected youth to be present. His come all approach overwhelmed him in his Manhattan location, and with Eddie seldom around, Herman was preyed upon. He never requested money for the lectures or use of his ritual room, and sometimes complained that the Wiccans were there a lot but spent very little money, though the satanists had cash. Even so, he provided a platform for alternative religions as long as he could. Herman was about inclusion, self empowerment, and love.
Praise
One of Slater's former employees described him as "Very bright, almost schizophrenic, fiercely loyal one moment, then your brutal enemy the next. I loved and hated him so many times in turn that it's all a blur." However, many loyal followers were befriended by Slater, including most of his loyal employees, loving family and friends. He was affectionately known as Mother Herman to those he cared about. Herman's attraction to witchcraft was not limited to paranormal experiences. He was truly on a spiritual quest for a religion that would not condemn his sexuality, and believed homosexuality was the expression of a man finding completion of his soul through the love of another man. Wicca had no taboos regarding homosexuality or self empowerment, another of Herman's quests that he shared with the world. Among his famous quotes was:"everythings in print now." Meaning magic was no longer held in the hands of the elite alone.

Rait Castle is a ruined hall-house castle dating from the thirteenth century, situated just south of Nairn near Inverness, Scotland. It is a scheduled monument.
Architecture
The remains of the courtyard walls are nine feet high and also contain the remains of the Chapel of St Mary of Rait. The building was a two story building, measuring 20 metres by 10 metres. It had an unvaulted basement and an upper hall. The hall was entered from the outside and was protected by a portcullis and a drawbar. The walls of the castle are nearly 6 feet thick. A tower projects from one corner of the castle and there is a garderobe tower on the west side that projects nearly 13 feet.
History
The castle was originally a property of the Comyn family, who took the name of de Rait. Sir Alexander Rait killed the third Thane of Cawdor (chief of Clan Calder), and then fled south where he married the heiress of Hallgreen. The castle later passed from the de Raits to the Mackintosh family and then to the Campbell family.
In 1442, when the castle passed to the Mackintoshes from the de Rait family, a feast was held at the castle between the two families which ended in the slaughter of most of the Comyns and de Raits. The laird blamed his daughter, whom he chased around the castle. She climbed out of a window but he chopped off her hands and she fell to her death. The castle is said to be haunted by her ghost, with no hands.
The Duke of Cumberland is said to have stayed at the castle before the Battle of Culloden in 1746, although the last recorded reference to the castle was in 1596.
American singer Bonnie Raitt is a descendant of the Rait clan, and visited Rait Castle in 1990.

The Chapel of the Snows is a non-denominational Christian church located at the United States' McMurdo Station on Ross Island, Antarctica and is one of eight churches on Antarctica.
Overview
The chapel is the second southernmost religious building in the world and has regular Catholic and Protestant services. During the Austral Summer, the chapel is staffed by rotational chaplains. The Diocese of Christchurch supplies Catholic priests and the U.S. Air National Guard supplies Protestant chaplains. The chapel is also host to services and meetings for other faith groups such as Latter Day Saints, Baháʼí, and Buddhism and non-religious groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. These meetings are dependent on lay leadership to be the points of contact and facilitators. The building itself may hold up to 63 worshippers.
The original Chapel of the Snows burned down in 1978 and was replaced with a new temporary chapel. After the current chapel was built, the makeshift building (which has since burned down as well) was converted to other uses. The current chapel, dedicated in 1989, features custom stained glass which depicts the Antarctica Continent, the Erebus Chalice (during Austral summers only), and memorabilia from the US Navy's historic involvement in Operation Deep Freeze. The altar of the Chapel of the Snows is believed to come from St Saviour's Chapel in Lyttelton, New Zealand, where Robert Falcon Scott worshiped prior to embarking on the ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition.
The chapel is one of the buildings which will be replaced as part of the Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science project, to upgrade and improve facilities at McMurdo.

Galeotto I Malatesta (1299–1385) was an Italian condottiero, who was lord of Rimini, Fano, Ascoli Piceno, Cesena and Fossombrone.
Biography
Born in Rimini, he was the son of Pandolfo I Malatesta and the brother of Malatesta II Malatesta. In 1333 he was captured while besieging Ferrara, but was soon freed and fought alongside Ferrantino Malatesta against the Papal legate in Romagna. When the latter plotted against him, Galeotto imprisoned him and declared himself lord of Rimini. The war between the two lasted until 1343. Ludwig of Bavaria also made him lord of Fano.
After a period as condottiero for and later tyrant of Ascoli Piceno, in 1349 he travelled to the Holy Land. In 1351 he was hired in the Kingdom of Naples. In 1352 Malatesta led a campaign in Abruzzo in the service of Louis of Anjou, King of Sicily, and laid siege to the fortress of Aversa, held by the mercenary leader Fra' Moriale.
In 1353 Innocent VI sent Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz as a legate into Italy, with a view to the restoration of the papal authority in the states of the Church, at the head of a small mercenary army. After receiving the support of the archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Visconti, and of those of Pisa, Florence and Siena, he defeated Giovanni di Vico, lord of Viterbo, who had usurped much of the Papal territories in the Latium and Umbria. Giovanni was defeated in the battle of Viterbo of 10 March 1354 and signed a treaty of submission. Albornoz then moved to the Marche and Romagna against the Malatesta of Rimini and the Ordelaffi of Forlì. The Papal commander Rodolfo II da Varano, lord of Camerino, defeated Galeotto Malatesta, forcing his family to become an ally of the Pope.
After the Albornoz's defeat his family was made Papal vicar in Rimini, Pesaro, Fano and Fossombrone. In 1356 he took part in the crusade declared against the Ordelaffi of Forlì. In the 1360 he was first made commander-in-chief by the Queen of Naples Joan I, but later he switched to the Republic of Florence and then again to the Byzantine Empire. In 1372 Pope Gregory XI confirmed Galeotto general commander of the Papal Army against Bernabò Visconti, whom he defeated at Montichiari, near Brescia, the following year.
After the death of his nephews, Galeotto managed to gain the whole family seigniory in Romagna (he had been already lord of Rimini from 1364 with Ungaro IV and Pandolfo II Malatesta, as well as sole ruler of Fano). After a series of small but ferocious ravages in the area, in 1376 he captured Cesena, adding Bertinoro in 1378. Later he warred against Guido da Polenta for Cesenatico, conquering Senigallia from him in 1383, as well as other lands. The war was continued by his sons, as Galeotto I died in 1385 at Cesena.
Family
He married to Elisabetta da Varano and had issue:
Carlo I Malatesta 1368-1429, condottiero, lord of Rimini, Fano, Cesena, Pesaro.
Pandolfo III Malatesta c.1369-1427, condottiero, lord of Fano.
Margherita Malatesta 1370-1399, married to Francesco I Gonzaga ruler of Mantua.
Andrea Malatesta 1373-1416, condottiero, lord of Cesena, Cervia, Bertinoro.
Galeotto II, lord of Cervia.

During the Eastern Han Dynasty in the year 143, Cao E drowned at the age of 13 in the Shun River because she wanted to save her father from drowning. She did this because of filial piety. After this act she was given the nickname 曹孝女; Cao Xiaonu (Cao, the filial piety daughter). In the year 151, a temple and a stele was made for her to honor Cao E. The original stele was lost over time but in the year 1093 (Northern Song Dynasty), Cai Bian (蔡卞) made a replacement stele. This stele is 2.1 metres high and 1 metre wide and is entitled: "The stele of Cao E, the filial piety daughter" and has become a historical monument. The stele is placed in the Cao'e Temple in the Shangyu District, Shaoxing in the northeast of Zhejiang Province in China.

James Frederic Ferguson (1807–1855) was an Irish antiquary.
Life
Ferguson was born at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1807. He was of French descent, son of Jacques Frédéric Jaquemain, a native of Cambrai. During the time of the French Revolution Jaquemain left France and settled in London, assuming the name of Ferguson in 1793. Six years later he went to America, and in 1800 became deputy-postmaster of Beaufort, South Carolina, where he resided till 1812. After the death of his wife, an English lady, Jaquemain went to London, where he became a teacher of languages. Subsequently, he established a school in St Stephen's Green, Dublin. In 1823 he published a volume of Italian translations from the classic poets.
James Frederic Ferguson the younger accompanied his father to Dublin in 1820, and some years later was engaged on behalf of Lord Kingsland in endeavouring to recover for that nobleman the Kingsland estates. His efforts were partially successful. In 1850 Ferguson was appointed clerk and secretary to a commission for arranging the records of the Irish courts, and this office he held until its abolition two years later. By direction of the chief baron, he continued in charge of the records from the time of the cessation of the commission until his death. On one occasion he undertook at his own expense a journey to Switzerland, in order to recover some Irish records in the collection of a Swabian baron. These records proved to belong to the Irish court of king's bench in the reign of Edward I, and it was surmised that they had been purloined in the reign of George I when Addison was keeper of the records in the Bermingham Tower of Dublin Castle. Ferguson purchased them at his own cost, and restored them to the State Paper Office. Ferguson died on 26 November 1855.
Works
He became a collaborator with William Lynch, author of Feudal Dignities in Ireland, in arranging the voluminous series of "Irish Records". Extensive collections of documents were formed, some of which afterwards passed into the library of Sir William Betham. Ferguson's most important work was the indexing of the entire body of Exchequer Records in Ireland, which he completed unassisted. The indexes were purchased by the government in order to be permanently deposited in the court of exchequer.
In 1843 Ferguson published Remarks on the Limitations of Actions Bill intended for Ireland; together with short extracts from Ancient Records relating to Advowsons of Churches in Ireland. To the Transactions of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society he communicated a calendar of the contents of the "Red Book" of the Irish exchequer; and to the Gentleman's Magazine (January 1855) he communicated a description of the ancient drawing of the court of exchequer, contained in the above manuscript calendar. To the Topographer and Genealogist he communicated the account of Sir Toby Caulfeild relative to the Earl of Tyrone and other fugitives from Ulster in 1616; a curious series of notes on the exactions anciently incident to tenures in Ireland; a list of the castles, &c., in Ireland in 1676, with a note on hearth- money; and a singular document of 3 Edward II, relative to a contest between the king's purveyors and the secular clergy of Meath.
Ferguson further contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine two important articles on the neglected state of the Irish State Records (1853–4), and a paper on the unpublished statutes of Ireland (1855). At his decease he left incomplete a translation of the "Norman-French Chronicle of the Conquest of Ireland", which M. Michel edited from a manuscript in Lambeth Palace Library.

A Registered Intermediary, in England and Wales, assists in communication between lawyers and vulnerable witnesses in court cases. Many people attending court as victims or witnesses have difficulties understanding the questions that they are asked by lawyers. Registered Intermediaries have professional backgrounds in areas such as speech and language therapy, nursing, occupational therapy, education, or psychology.
They are also available to assist police officers who are interviewing vulnerable witnesses. In all cases, the intermediary completes a comprehensive assessment of the vulnerable person's communication needs and makes recommendations in a written report of how the person should be questioned.
Registered Intermediaries are not appropriate adults or expert witnesses whilst undertaking this role.
A new scheme was piloted in Northern Ireland in 2013 in which vulnerable suspects and defendants at court are also able to access a Registered Intermediary.
In England and Wales, legislation has been passed (but not yet implemented) to enable vulnerable defendants to access an Intermediary while they give oral testimony at court. However, in the meantime in the interest of justice, the Criminal Practice Directions (2013) allow the court the discretion to appoint an intermediary for a vulnerable defendant. The two largest providers of intermediaries for defendants in the criminal and family courts are Communicourt and Triangle. Intermediaries for Justice (IfJ) is a registered charity with a vision of opening the ‘accessible door' to justice; where all people understand the questions they are asked and can tell what has happened. IfJ promotes and supports the work of intermediaries, who are communication specialists working with vulnerable people in the justice system. It also provides a search for an intermediary facility https://www.intermediaries-for-justice.org

Lobos de Arga (released as Game of Werewolves in the United States and Attack of the Werewolves in the United Kingdom) is a 2012 Spanish comedy-horror film directed by .
Plot
In 1910, in Arga, a small village from Galicia, the Mariño family is cursed by a gypsy woman as punishment for the excesses of the Marquise de Mariño. Upon reaching the age of ten, her son becomes a werewolf.
A hundred years later, Tomás, a struggling novelist and the last descendant of the Mariño family, returns to the village on invitation from its mayor to participate in a ceremony and to seek inspiration within his childhood home: a large and abandoned mansion. In his exploration of the village on the following days, he reunites with his childhood friend Calisto and with his uncle Evaristo, the latter of whom has been elected both the town's priest and mayor. Despite being touted as the guest of honor, Tomás feels concerned that he is virtually unknown among the locals. Further adding to his dismay is the sudden appearance of Mario, his shady publisher on the run from the law.
On the night of the ceremony, Tomás and Mario are brutally abducted by the villagers and taken to a reinforced barn on the village's outskirts. There, upon cryptic prophecies told by Evaristo, the both of them are dropped into a dark labyrinth beneath the village. In their search for a way out, they inadvertently awaken the werewolf of legend, who proceeds to give chase. Meanwhile, Calisto locates a secret way to the labyrinth and pulls Tomás and Mario out, leaving the werewolf behind.
The group takes shelter in Calisto's house. He explains that the village sought to end a century-old curse by feeding a descendant of the Mariño family, lest another greater curse take effect. Furthermore, the villagers have blocked the ways out of the town and disabled Tomás' car. Tomás attempts to call his grandmother for help, but his cellphone's reception is too poor for his pleas to go through, and the call drops after a short time.
Under suspicion from the village and in light of gruesome deaths having happened the night before, Calisto is sent down into the labyrinth to kill the werewolf as the curse is presumed to have remained in effect. Instead, he finds a young boy, whom he covertly takes into his home. Hoping to end the curse, he and Mario feed one of Tomás fingers to the presumed wolf-child.
The group wanders out at sundown to escape the village on foot but are caught by Evaristo and his mob. As the confrontation escalates, the sun sets and the second curse takes effect, transforming all the villagers into werewolves - except for Calisto whom despite being a local, was actually born outside of the village. Tomás' grandmother, Rosa (Mabel Rivera), arrives at the same moment, taking the group into her car and escaping to the family mansion.
Meanwhile, two policemen arrive into the village upon a tip from Rosa, suspicious after Tomás' earlier call. While one panics and runs to his death, the other (Luis Zahera) escapes by shooting himself in the head.
Tomás and the group are forced to leave the mansion after the werewolves invade it, but are rescued by the policeman revealed to have faked his suicide by letting the bullet only graze his scalp. Retreating to the village's church, they fend off another werewolf attack at the cost of Rosa's death, narrowly escaping into the underground labyrinths before destroying the church and most of the werewolves with a stack of dynamite. As they take their distance from the village center, the child's age briskly catches up with him, and he dies after turning into an old man before Tomás' eyes.
The church's explosion and Luis' lack of radio response have attracted the police's attention, and rescue teams arrive at daybreak to find the mass of dead werewolves. Suspicious that Calisto and Mario might have been bitten by the werewolves and infected, Tomás chains them to a piece of furniture in his home and stands guard with a shotgun in case they turn. Unexpectedly, however, Tomás transforms, and the film ends as he prepares to take revenge on the two for his missing fingers.

De fisco Barcinonensi ("Concerning the Barcelonian Fisc") is a letter (epistola) from a group of bishops in the province of Tarraconensis in the Visigothic Kingdom to the treasury agents in Barcelona. The letter reminds the officials of the fixed rate of public tribute and demands that exactions in excess of that amount should stop. In the manuscripts, De fisco is preserved after the acts of the Second Council of Barcelona of 540, but its signatories are mostly those of the acts of the First Council of Zaragoza of 592. Most scholars believe it should be dated in connexion with the latter council. The bishops describe themselves as "all [those] who contribute to the fisc of the city of Barcelona", but the bishop of Barcelona, Ugnas, did not sign. The location of the regional fiscal administration in Barcelona perhaps explains why that city survived the Islamic conquest better than the provincial capital, Tarragona.
The Epistola de fisco Barcinonensi is an important source on tax collection in the Visigothic period. It is addressed to the "accountants" (numerarii) whose job it was to collect the tax, and who were appointed for one-year terms by the local "count of the patrimony" (comes patrimonii)—at the time a certain Scipio—and the bishops (episcopi). The involvement of the bishops was, according to their letter, "by custom" (sicut consuetudo). This custom had been formalised by the Third Council of Toledo in 589, which mandated annual provincial councils of bishops and fiscal agents (actores fiscalium patrimoniorum) so that the latter would be just in their dealings with the people. The circumstances and tenor of the letter strongly suggest that the tax was levied on the entire rate-paying (predominantly Roman) population of the province, while the "patrimonial" nature of the levy indicates that it went to the royal treasury. It may be a relict of the one third of land, in the form of land taxes, that went to the Visigothic king at the time of the conquest, while the remaining two thirds went to his followers.
The going tax rate in Barcelona in the 590s was fourteen siliquae (or solidus) per modius of barley. It is impossible to convert this rate into a percentage, since the value of a modius cannot be stated with precision, and it probably represented a unit of land that could produce a certain amount of barley. Unless the modius was a great deal larger than that of earlier times, the tax rate was comparable to that under the Romans.

This is a list of the main and recurring fictional characters from the Yorkshire Television espionage series, The Sandbaggers.
Main characters
Neil Burnside
A career intelligence officer, the series' protagonist is Neil Burnside; Director of Operations ("D-Ops") of SIS, a former Sandbagger, and ex-Royal Marine commando. He is devious, manipulative, and by turns dour, brusque, aggressive and independent-minded, putting him frequently in conflict with others. He is fiercely patriotic and devoted to the preservation of Britain's national security, but while battling the KGB, his main sources of antagonism are the people on his side: superiors in SIS, whom he alternately considers too cautious or too reckless; self-serving politicians who grant or withhold permission for his covert operations; territory-hungry MI5 officers; and entrenched civil servants. A heavy drinker while a Sandbagger, Burnside is a teetotaler since becoming D-Ops.
His single-minded devotion to his job cost him his marriage before the start of the series, though he maintains a close relationship with his former father-in-law, Sir Geoffrey Wellingham, the Permanent Undersecretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This provides him a conduit through which to bypass both the Deputy Chief of SIS and C himself. His one attempt at a romantic relationship is with Laura Dickens, a Sandbagger recruit in the first series; aside from this, Burnside's personal life outside SIS is all but non-existent.
The series begins six months after Burnside has become Director of Operations, and a running theme is the high casualty rate that his directorate suffers. Fiercely protective of his agents, Burnside tries to keep them from being abused by others in power, despite the risks inherent in their profession. He is played by Roy Marsden.
Willie Caine
Head of the Special Operations Section ("Sandbagger One"), Willie Caine is a former Paratrooper and, according to Burnside, the best operative of his kind in the world. Caine is not afraid to speak his mind nor to openly differ with Burnside, but remains steadfastly loyal to him. Although he dislikes both violence and guns, he is prepared to use them when necessary; he also shows himself on a number of occasions to be willing to risk his life, both for SIS and for Burnside personally. Besides Burnside, Caine is the only character who appears in every episode of the series; he is played by Ray Lonnen.
Mike Wallace
Introduced as "Sandbagger Three" in the first episode of the second series, Wallace quickly becomes "Sandbagger Two" after the death of fellow Sandbagger Tom Elliott; he remains Sandbagger Two for the remainder of the series, the longest Sandbagger tenure after Willie Caine. A fluent French speaker, Wallace develops from new recruit to seasoned veteran over the second and third series, even successfully undertaking a dangerous mission to rescue a wounded CIA operative trapped in Russia. Burnside puts his career on the line to protect Wallace from a vengeful station chief in the second series episode "A Question of Loyalty". He is played by Michael Cashman.
Sir James Greenley
The Head of SIS when the series begins, code-named "C". A diplomat by training, Greenley is initially treated with suspicion by Burnside. Over the course of the first two series, Burnside comes to both trust and become fond of Greenley, who has the difficult task of balancing political as well as security concerns. Greenley becomes an almost paternal figure to Burnside, often protecting him from the consequences of his worst instincts and keeping the peace between Burnside and Matthew Peele, the deputy chief. He retires at the end of the second series as a result of angina, and Burnside is disappointed to see him replaced by the less benevolent John Tower Gibbs (Dennis Burgess), who remains C for the rest of the series. Greenley is played by Richard Vernon.
Sir Geoffrey Wellingham
Sir Geoffrey Wellingham, KCMG, DSC is the Permanent Undersecretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that oversees SIS. As Burnside's former father-in-law, he is Burnside's contact within Whitehall, and the two often share information and use each other. This avenue of communication is somewhat outside regular channels, and although it can be useful for both Burnside and SIS, the two men occasionally become adversaries when their agendas differ. Due to his background, experience, and position, Wellingham can be a formidable opponent for Burnside, and reminds him of that more than once. Wellingham appears in all but two episodes in the series and is played by Alan MacNaughtan.
Matthew Peele
The Deputy Head of SIS, former Head of Hong Kong Station and, like Burnside, a career intelligence officer. Unlike Burnside, Peele has little field experience and is more concerned with going by the book, avoiding rocking the political boat, and furthering his own ambitions to higher rank. As a result, Peele often stands in opposition to Burnside, against what he sees as Burnside's recklessness, contempt for the proper chain of command, and lack of political tact. He is disliked by his subordinates and considered a tyrant with no opinions of his own, but proves himself just as committed to the security of Britain as Burnside; their relationship evolves over the course of the series to one of mutual respect (if still antagonistic). Peele appears in all but two episodes and is played by Jerome Willis.
John Tower Gibbs
Introduced in the last episode of the second series ("Operation Kingmaker"), John Tower Gibbs replaces Sir James Greenley as C and remains in that capacity until the end of the series. Gibbs is a career intelligence officer, former head of the Washington and Bonn stations and working with the Joint Intelligence Committee when he is appointed C. He and Burnside have an antagonistic relationship from the start, stemming from an altercation they had when Burnside was a Sandbagger and Gibbs was head of Bonn station. Unlike his predecessor, who called Burnside "Neil", Gibbs refers to Burnside only by his surname, disapproves of his methods, and is suspicious of the special relationship with the CIA, preferring to see it phased out. For his part, Burnside views Gibbs as a tyrant who will stifle his (Burnside's) ability to run his directorate. They clash throughout the third series, but in one episode where Burnside is on leave and Caine is Acting D-Ops, Caine and Gibbs work very well together. Gibbs is played by Dennis Burgess.
Jeff Ross
The head of the CIA's London station, Ross is Burnside's confidant, resource, and his closest, if not only, friend. The two often have lunch and work together to preserve the "special relationship" between the CIA and SIS, and Ross takes an interest in Burnside's (non-existent) personal life. The close relationship between the two does not prevent Ross from using Burnside and SIS on at least one occasion for his own ends, and in some episodes, Burnside and Ross work at cross-purposes; their personal relationship is almost destroyed when Ross cons Burnside in order to use SIS to head off an MI5 investigation into a CIA agent. He is played by Bob Sherman.
Edward Tyler
Director of Intelligence (D-Int) for SIS, Tyler appears in the second series and the first two episodes of the third. He and Burnside have a friendly relationship of mutual respect; Burnside considers Tyler the best D-Int he's ever known, and Tyler offers Burnside whatever help he can in operations. In the episode "To Hell with Justice", Tyler is revealed to have been a double agent for 23 years; he asks the KGB to lift him in Malta, but after leaving a trail for SIS to follow and stop the lift, Burnside arrives to assassinate him (against direct orders from C). Rather that put his friend through such an ordeal, Tyler calmly commits suicide with a cyanide pill. He is played by Peter Laird.
Other characters
Other Sandbaggers who appear only briefly are Jake Landy (David Glyder), Alan Denson (Steven Grives), and Laura Dickens (Diane Keen), all killed in the first series; and Tom Elliot (David Beames), killed in the first episode of the second series. Burnside's capable and fiercely loyal personal assistant, Diane Lawler (Elizabeth Bennett), retires at the end of the second series and is replaced by Marianne Straker (Sue Holderness), who stays with Burnside throughout the third series. Karen Milner (Jana Sheldon) is a CIA field officer who reports to Jeff Ross and sometimes works alongside one or more of the Sandbaggers; she is only seen in the second series.
After Tyler's suicide, he is replaced as D-Int by Paul Dalgetty (David Robb), an arrogant and considerably less capable officer who has a completely antagonistic relationship with Burnside. Dalgetty openly maneuvers to replace Burnside as D-Ops, going so far as to hide intelligence communiqués from Burnside in order to do manipulate C and Peele, but at the end of the series, he remains D-Int.

The p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) also known as Bcl-2-binding component 3 (BBC3), is a pro-apoptotic protein, member of the Bcl-2 protein family. In humans, the Bcl-2-binding component 3 protein is encoded by the BBC3 gene. The expression of PUMA is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53. PUMA is involved in p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis induced by a variety of signals, and is regulated by transcription factors, not by post-translational modifications. After activation, PUMA interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, thus freeing Bax and/or Bak which are then able to signal apoptosis to the mitochondria. Following mitochondrial dysfunction, the caspase cascade is activated ultimately leading to cell death.
Structure
The PUMA protein is part of the BH3-only subgroup of Bcl-2 family proteins. This group of proteins only share sequence similarity in the BH3 domain, which is required for interactions with Bcl-2-like proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Structural analysis has shown that PUMA directly binds to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins via an amphiphatic α-helical structure which is formed by the BH3 domain. The mitochondrial localization of PUMA is dictated by a hydrophobic domain on its C-terminal portion. PUMA protein degradation is regulated by phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue at position 10.[31]
Mechanism of action
Biochemical studies have shown that PUMA interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and A1, inhibiting their interaction with the proapoptotic molecules, Bax and Bak. When the inhibition of these is lifted, they result in the translocation of Bax and activation of mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins cytochrome c, SMAC, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) leading to caspase activation and cell death.
Because PUMA has high affinity for binding to Bcl-2 family members, another hypothesis is that PUMA directly activates Bax and/or Bak and through Bax multimerization triggers mitochondrial translocation and with it induces apoptosis. Various studies have shown though, that PUMA does not rely on direct interaction with Bax/Bak to induce apoptosis.
Regulation
Induction
The majority of PUMA induced apoptosis occurs through activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 is activated by survival signals such as glucose deprivation and increases expression levels of PUMA. This increase in PUMA levels induces apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction. p53, and with it PUMA, is activated due to DNA damage caused by a variety of genotoxic agents. Other agents that induce p53 dependent apoptosis are neurotoxins, proteasome inhibitors, microtubule poisons, and transcription inhibitors.
PUMA apoptosis may also be induced independently of p53 activation by other stimuli, such as oncogenic stress growth factor and/or cytokine withdrawal and kinase inhibition, ER stress, altered redox status, ischemia, immune modulation, and infection.
Degradation
PUMA levels are downregulated through the activation of caspase-3 and a protease inhibited by the serpase inhibitor N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, in response to signals such as the cytokine TGFβ, the death effector TRAIL or chemical drugs such as anisomycin. PUMA protein is degraded in a proteasome dependent manner and its degradation is regulated by phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue at position 10.
Role in cancer
Several studies have shown that PUMA function is affected or absent in cancer cells. Additionally, many human tumors contain p53 mutations, which results in no induction of PUMA, even after DNA damage induced through irradiation or chemotherapy drugs. Other cancers, which exhibit overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, counteract and overpower PUMA-induced apoptosis. Even though PUMA function is compromised in most cancer cells, it does not appear that genetic inactivation of PUMA is a direct target of cancer. Many cancers do exhibit p53 gene mutations, making gene therapies that target this gene impossible, but an alternate pathway may be to focus on therapeutic to target PUMA and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Animal studies have shown that PUMA does play a role in tumor suppression, but lack of PUMA activity alone does not translate to spontaneous formation of malignancies. Inhibiting PUMA induced apoptosis may be an interesting target for reducing the side effects of cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, which induce apoptosis in rapidly dividing healthy cells in addition to rapidly dividing cancer cells.
PUMA can also function as an indicator of p53 mutations. Many cancers exhibit mutations in the p53 gene, but this mutation can only be detected through extensive DNA sequencing. Studies have shown that cells with p53 mutations have significantly lower levels of PUMA, making it a good candidate for a protein marker of p53 mutations, providing a simpler method for testing for p53 mutations.
Cancer therapeutics
Therapeutic agents targeting PUMA for cancer patients are emerging. PUMA inducers target cancer or tumor cells, while PUMA inhibitors can be targeted to normal, healthy cells to help alleviate the undesired side effects of chemo and radiation therapy.
Cancer treatments
Research has shown that increased PUMA expression with or without chemotherapy or irradiation is highly toxic to cancer cells, specifically lung, head and neck, esophagus, melanoma, malignant glioma, gastric glands, breast and prostate. In addition, studies have shown that PUMA adenovirus seems to induce apoptosis more so than p53 adenovirus. This is beneficial in combating cancers that inhibit p53 activation and therefore indirectly decrease PUMA expression levels.
Resveratrol, a plant-derived stilbenoid, is currently under investigation as a cancer treatment. Resveratrol acts to inhibit and decrease expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members while also increasing p53 expression. The combination of these two mechanisms leads to apoptosis via activation of PUMA, Noxa and other proapoptotic proteins, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.
Other approaches focus on inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members just as PUMA does, allowing cells to undergo apoptosis in response to cancerous activity. Preclinical studies involving these inhibitors, also described as BH3 mimetics, have produced promising results.
Side-effect treatment
Irradiation therapy is dose-limited by undesired side effects in healthy tissue. PUMA has been shown to be active in inducing apoptosis in hematopoietic and intestinal tissue following γ-irradiation. Since inhibition of PUMA does not directly cause spontaneous malignancies, therapeutics to inhibit PUMA function in healthy tissue could lessen or eliminate the side effects of traditional cancer therapies.

Niel D. Tupas Sr. (November 27, 1932 – November 24, 2015) was the Governor of the province of Iloilo, a representative of the 5th District of the same province to the Batasang Pambansa (1978–1984) and Philippine Congress (1987–1998), and mayor of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo.
Tupas was a Bachelor of Law graduate and the first President of the Municipal Mayors' League of Iloilo in 1973 and Municipal Mayors' League of the Philippines. He was also the President of Western Visaya's Municipal Mayors' League in 1977. Tupas is the father of incumbent Iloilo representative Niel Tupas Jr.
Biography
Tupas obtained his pre-law his Bachelor of Laws from the University of the Philippines in 1957 and passed the Bar in the same year.
Political life
After unsuccessful attempts for Congress, he won the post of municipal mayor of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo in 1972, where he served for seven years. In 1978, he was elected as assemblyman in the Batasang Pambansa. In 1987, he was elected as congressman, serving a total of 11 years as legislator under the new democratic government.
In 2001, Niel Tupas was elected governor of Iloilo. He led Iloilo Province to several national awards, especially in the anti-illegal gambling against jueteng campaign, stopping illegal fishing, and the clean and green program. He was re-elected in 2004 and once more during the May 12, 2007 elections, where he is now on his third term. He also sits as member of the Council of Advisers of the League of Provinces of the Philippines.
Gov. Tupas and Mrs. Tupas have seven children, many of whom hold political office: they are the parents of Congressman Niel Tupas Jr., the mayor of Barotac Viejo, Iloilo, Niel Tupas III and Lex Tupas. Mrs Tupas herself served three times as municipal mayor of Municipality of Barotac Viejo.
Gov. Tupas was charged for graft and corruption before the Ombudsman for granting a quarry permit to an unqualified contractor who was said to have partnered with a mining company owned by the in-laws of his son Raul. The Ombudsman ordered Tupas dismissed in 2007, but his reelection in the same year made the penalty unenforceable.
In September 2015, two months before his death, Tupas Sr., together with three local government officials, was charged of graft by the Sandiganbayan on the case of anomalous payments to Green Core Geothermal, Inc. This involved 4 million Philippine pesos' worth of unconsumed electricity by the Iloilo provincial government from 2009-2010, under his term as the province governor. Tupas later posted bail for the case, and the anti-graft court withdrew the arrest warrant.

Mary Ross Banks (, Ross; after first marriage, Bowdre; after second marriage, Banks; March 4, 1846 – September 15, 1910) was an American litterateur and author. Her literary fame came to her suddenly and was the result of one book, Bright Days on the Old Plantation (Boston, 1882).
Early life and education
Mary Matthews Ross was born in Macon, Georgia, March 4, 1846. On her father's side she was from Scotch ancestry. Her grandfather, Luke Ross (1775-1844), was a wealthy man for his day, and had a well-appointed home, the furniture of which was hauled in wagons from New York City to North Carolina. He moved to Jones County, Georgia, when Macon was a small trading port. Mrs. Banks' father, John Bennett Ross, was one of seven brothers and three sisters. The Ross brothers established themselves in trade about the year 1832, which resulted in commercial success. There were changes in the course of time, some of the brothers embarking in other kinds of business, but John B. Ross continued in the wholesale and retail dry goods and planters' supply business till he died and made so large a fortune that he was known as "the merchant prince of the South." His home was the center of entertainment, and his children were reared in luxury. Married three times, his second wife, Martha Redding, descended from the Lanes and Flewellens, and was Banks' mother. Banks had 11 siblings, included the sisters Flora and Violet, and a brother, William Henry Ross.
Banks was educated in Wesleyan Female College, in Macon, and in the private school of Mrs. Theodosia Bartow Ford.
Career
In 1863, she married Edward Preston Bowdre (1839–1874) of Macon, at that time a captain in the Confederate States Army. She went to the army with her husband and served in the hospitals. At twenty-five years of age, she was a widow with three sons, including Jack Ross Bowdre and Julien Leon Bowdre, and much of the fortune that should have been hers dissipated by the hazard of civil war and the scarcely less trying period of reconstruction.
In June 1875, she married Dr. John Truman Banks (1829–1880) of Griffin, Georgia, a gentleman of high standing, socially and professionally, and lived with him for four years, when she was again a widow. Crushed by her grief, she went to work to help herself and her boys, though she had no training for business, and no knowledge of labor. She was a successful farmer and turned many of her talents and accomplishments into money-making. After raising her sons to the age of independence, she accepted a position in the Department of the Interior at Washington, where she has been assigned to work in the office of the Secretary.
Her literary fame came to her suddenly and was the result of one book, Bright Days on the Old Plantation (Boston, 1882). It is a narrative of life on a broad plantation in antebellum days, founded on the experiences of the author. There were also a number of sketches and short stories published in various newspapers and periodicals.
Banks was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and was named a delegate to its Continental Congress of April 1910, on behalf of the Mary Hammon Washington Chapter of Macon.
Death
She died at Washington, D.C., September 15, 1910 at age 64, and was interned in Griffin, Georgia.

Robert Einar Stensholt (born 11 July 1945) is a former Australian Labor Party politician who represented the Victorian state seat of Burwood in the Victorian Legislative Assembly (the lower house) of the state's parliament.
He represented Burwood for the Victorian ALP from 1999 to 2010. From 2007 he was the Chair of the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee, and from February 2003 to December 2006 he was Parliamentary Secretary for Treasury and Finance.
His initial victory in the seat of Burwood came at a by-election on 11 December 1999 following the resignation from parliament of the previous member for Burwood (and former Premier of Victoria) Jeff Kennett. Stensholt had been defeated by Kennett at the state election held two months earlier. However, at the by-election, the Liberals lost 15 percent of their primary vote, allowing Stensholt to take the seat on a swing of 10.4 percent.
His by-election victory was unexpected and cemented the result of the 1999 state election, which for a period had been up for grabs following an election in which three independents ended up with the balance of power, eventually throwing their support behind the Labor Party. The Liberals, in the person of Kennett, had held the seat since it was recreated in 1976, most recently by a margin of 10% at the state election less than two months previously.
Early in his career, Stensholt had studied to be a Catholic priest, a matter the Liberal Party attempted to make some mileage out of during his by-election campaign.
Since discontinuing his religious studies, he had primarily worked in various roles with the Australian Public Service in Canberra, most notably as Assistant Director-General of Australia's overseas aid program, AusAID. Prior to being elected, he was working as a senior research fellow at Monash University and as an international development consultant.
He was re-elected for a third term at the 2006 Victorian State Election with a two-candidate preferred margin of 7.46%.
He was defeated at the 2010 election when the ALP was voted out of office, with a 9.6% swing against him, seeing the seat return to Liberal hands.

Railway Square is a plaza at the southern end of the Sydney central business district, New South Wales, Australia, formed by the confluence of Broadway, Lee Street, Pitt Street and George Street. The square itself is a very busy intersection and is the site of a large bus terminus. The University of Technology, Central railway station and the now-closed Kent Brewery are adjacent to Railway Square.
History
Railway Square was originally known as Central Square. In the 19th century and early 20th century, Central Square was the heart of the city's modern retail district, enhanced by the presence of Central railway station and its adjacent hotels, erected to serve country visitors arriving in Sydney by train. The Marcus Clark department stores were located in a number of buildings at Central Square. The Parcel Post Office in Lee Street was built in 1913, having been designed by George McRae, the government architect. It was later restored and converted to the Medina Hotel.
The area was previously a busy nexus for the electric tramways of Sydney until the system's closure in the late 1950s.
Until the 1990s, Railway Square had a three-platform bus terminal in its centre. The platforms were connected to one another, as well as the opposite sides of Lee Street and Broadway, by an extension of the Devonshire Street Tunnel. The tunnel was accessible by escalator.
The site was redeveloped in 1999 to incorporate two platforms, lifts, a cafe and access to the University of Technology. The site was fitted with public artwork created by Merilyn Fairskye, including murals, illuminated wall panels and four towers with coloured steel ribbons inside, representing the four elements (Air, Water, Earth and Fire). Railway Square is dominated by the rising glass bus terminal structure, and by four sculpture light towers. The area is now an interchange for Busways and Transit Systems bus routes.
Rail tunnel
Railway Square is not only traversed underneath by the extension of the Devonshire Street pedestrian tunnel, but also by a railway tunnel that runs underneath at the southern end of the square, known as the Darling Dive. The tunnel was part of the Metropolitan Goods line linking the main lines south from Central with Darling Harbour. This tunnel is the oldest railway tunnel in New South Wales and is now disused. The section of the rail line between the tunnel and the Powerhouse Museum is now a park and pedestrian pathway called The Goods Line. The section beyond the Powerhouse Museum has been converted to light rail.

The Best were an English–American supergroup originally formed in London in 1990, featuring Keith Emerson (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer) on keyboards, John Entwistle (of the Who) on bass and vocals, Joe Walsh (Eagles, James Gang, and solo fame) on guitar and vocals, Jeff "Skunk" Baxter (Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers) on guitar, and Simon Phillips (the Jack Bruce band, 801, the Jeff Beck Group; later of Toto) on drums. Relative unknown Rick Livingstone sang lead vocals (along with Walsh and Entwistle). Backing vocals were provided by Hamish, Angus and Fergus Richardson of the band Brother.
In a 1994 interview posted on the Who mailing list, Entwistle said that the Best had toured Japan, and that an American tour had been planned but never came to fruition. In the same interview he also noted that drummer Zak Starkey had also been "in the band a while".
In 2010, a DVD of the band's 26 September 1990 performance in Yokohama, Japan was released.

Neutraubling is a town in the state of Bavaria in southern Germany, in the district of Regensburg.
The town has only existed since 1951. After the second world war, displaced ethnic Germans from Sudetenland (Czech Lands) or former eastern territories of Germany (Poland) settled in the ruins of the bombed military airport. Today, it is a more or less important industrial site.
During the Second World War, Neutraubling was used as an airbase and factory for the Messerschmitt aircraft manufacturing company.
Between the end of 1940 and April 23, 1945, the factory was able to house up to 2,750 slave laborers at a time.
Between 20 February 1945 and 26 April 1945, inmates of Flossenbürg concentration camp were held there until forced into a 'death march' to Dachau concentration camp.
Even today, it is possible to find relics of the early history of Neutraubling and its airbase past. For example, what is known as the "Schlangenbau", which is now home to people from various nations all over the world, was the command centre of the airbase. The small pond located next to the Schlangenbau was used as a water reservoir for the airbase fire brigade.
Even the Catholic church there still harbours various signs of the past. It is said that parts of the wall of the church were taken from a destroyed hangar. The main road leading through the city itself has its roots in one of the World War II airstrips.
Despite Neutraubling's earliest roots dating back to the stone age period, it can't compete with Regensburg's rich history.
Neutraubling also provides a fully fledged education infrastructure starting with three kindergartens up to a grammar school. Furthermore, Neutraubling is also home to various medium-sized and internationally operating enterprises, e.g. Krones, which has its very roots in this city. Nightlife in Neutraubling is what can be expected from a city of only 13,000 inhabitants.

The Ralt RT33 was a Formula 3 racing car that was developed and built by Ralt in 1989 and was used in various Formula 3 championships. A total of 37 chassis' were made.
Development history and technology
The RT33 was the logical further development of the RT32 from 1988. As with the previous model, the RT33 used both aluminum and carbon fiber as the material for the monocoque chassis. To improve aerodynamics, Ron Tauranac rented a wind tunnel during the development phase. The result was new sidepods and a completely new rear end with a rear wing that was connected to the body on the left and right. New regulations and the resulting radial tires that Avon supplied made it necessary to revise the suspension in order to achieve better traction.
The engines came from Volkswagen and Mugen. A total of 118 chassis were built and delivered by Ralt in 1989 and 1990. Power outputs for the four-cylinder engines was around .
Racing history
In 1989, the RT33 became the all-important racing car in the Formula 3 racing series. In the British Formula 3 Championship , David Brabham won the general classification ahead of fellow drivers Allan McNish and Derek Higgins . Steve Robertson was fifth overall and Belgian Philippe Adams sixth. In the German championship, Karl Wendlinger triumphed, whose RT33 was entered by Helmut Marko. In the Japanese series, Masahiko Kageyama remained successful with five race wins.

John of Gaunt's chevauchée of 1373 was an English military raid at the end of the second period of the Hundred Years' War by John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, from his departure from Calais in August 1373 to his arrival at Bordeaux at the end of December 1373.
With more than covered, it is the longest of the chevauchées organised by the English on the continent. Despite the devastation caused, the weak military and political results, and the enormous losses, make it a failure for the English crown.
Background
War had resumed in 1369 and Charles V of France, wise politician and strategist, strived to progressively recapture the English possessions on the continent. Edward III who ruled England had been suffering military setbacks for some years. Calais, Brittany, the Atlantic coast at the South of the Gironde estuary and the county of Angoulême were the only territories which remained loyal to him.
His second son, John of Gaunt, was born in 1340. He was the recent widower of Blanche of Lancaster, who by giving him the duchy of Lancaster (one of the three counties palatine of England since the 12th century, close to the frontier with Wales) had made him one of the richest landowners of the country. He was described as a brave warrior, but less competent than his older brother Edward the Black Prince. At the end of 1369, he had already led a disappointing chevauchée through Artois, Picardy and Normandy before turning back toward Calais.
At the end of the year 1372, the Parliament of England approved a project of reinforcement of the naval forces and sending of an expeditionary force of 4,000 men led by John of Gaunt. According to the initial plan, the latter must land in Brittany to restore the authority of John IV of Brittany, then cross the river Loire at Nantes and enter Aquitaine through Bas-Poitou
However, during the first semester of 1373, the English situation in Brittany had considerably worsened: the French had retaken Nantes, which destroyed the Duke of Lancaster's hope to cross the river Loire there. Only three places remained friendly : Derval, defended by the free companies of Robert Knolles, Brest in the hands of John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville, and Auray, held by the duchess of Brittany, Joan Holland, second wife of Duke John IV of Brittany. In this context, the road to Aquitaine was compromised, and the plan was abandoned in May. Furthermore, the English naval strength was too weak to attempt a direct transportation through the Bay of Biscay. Only remained the option of a landing at Calais, bypassing Paris by the East.
Tactics
Since he became king, Charles V avoided as much as possible to expose his knights to pitched battles.
In response, the English applied the tactic of the chevauchée, whose goal was to ravage the countryside. On the widest possible front, their columns looted the rural areas, burned the harvests and destroyed the infrastructures. They lived off the land and gathered to attack the ones of the cities which refused to give them a payment. The model was inaugurated by Edward III in 1346, then improved by the Black Prince in Languedoc in 1355 and in Poitou in 1356.
An answer was developed by Charles V and the Constable of France Bertrand du Guesclin: to put the population inside strongholds with supplies and livestock, and to destroy what could not be protected. The soldiers gathered inside castles and fortified cities, while mobile troops harassed the enemy columns and disturbed their lines of supply. These columns were condemned to march on scorched-earth surrounded by strongholds.
Chevauchée
Gathering at Calais
In spite of the modification of the plan and the lack of interest from John of Brittany for the new itinerary, the latter joined his forces to those of Lancaster, probably half-heartened. The responsibility of going by sea to support Neville and Knolles at Brest, who by now had to eat their own horses, went to the Earl of Salisbury. They landed at Calais at the beginning of July 1373. There they gathered, until August 9, brought by a fleet of more than a hundred ships requisitioned in the eastern harbours of the island or chartered in Holland and Flanders, an army of 6,000 archers and 3,000 men-at-arms (of which 1800 Scottish mercenaries), accompanied by 2,000 non combatants. The troops were commanded by the Constable Edward Despenser, assisted by the Marshals Thomas Beauchamp and William Ufford. Several English noblemen were with them, like Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, and several prestigious captains as Hugh Calveley or Walter Hewitt.
Bypassing Paris
We were in August when, banners all unfurled, a Wednesday morning, Froissart tells us, the troops left Calais, separated in two columns. The one of John IV marching southward, towards Hesdin, to make junction at the river Somme east of Amiens. The other, led by John of Gaunt, marching 60 km further east. He passed in front of Guînes and Ardres, which were allied to him. For the first night of bivouacking, the English camp stretched over several miles, between Balinghem and Licques. On the next day, the soldiers rode to Saint-Omer, held by a vassal of the king of France. There, a few hours later at Thérouanne where 1200 French soldiers were gathered, no fight was engaged, each side observing the enemy beyond the fortifications.
The column advanced around ten kilometers a day, pillaging and burning on a wide front. At the vanguard walked the troops commanded by the Marshals, followed by the group under orders from the two Dukes. Behind were the supply chariots. Finally, the Constable's army closed the march. The width of the front was a consequence of the need to sufficiently supply the men in food, but offered the disadvantage of having the groups dispersed, at the mercy of attacks from the French cavalry, or even peasants.
This is how, on the following days, the invaders confronted French soldiers in Artois, in the outskirts of Aire-sur-la-Lys and Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise. A violent skirmish happened before the walls of Doullens, which was almost captured. Around August 19, the two Dukes made junction on the Somme, after John of Gaunt, passing next to Arras, also failed to take Bray-sur-Somme.
In the meantime in Amiens, in the French camp, Philip the Bold was completing his army to face them. Charles V had also called in reinforcement the troops of the captains stationed in Brittany: Bertrand du Guesclin, temporarily blocked in Derval, and with him, Olivier de Clisson, nicknamed the Butcher, the , , etc. In Ribemont-sur-Ancre, the latter, supported by the lords of Chin and Bousies and 120 soldiers, attacked 80 soldiers of Hugh of Calveley, routing them. Continuing on their destructive path, the invaders set Roye on fire, whose inhabitants had sought refuge inside the fortified church.
Around 3 September, the Dukes spent three days in Vaux-sur-Laon, a suburb of Laon, while their troops looted and ransacked the countryside without the 1800 French and Breton soldiers of Laon preventing them to do so. Then, the army headed to Soissons, closely followed by about 2400 men led by Philip of Burgundy, who applied the strategy of avoiding pitched battles: his men ordered the civilians to take refuge inside cities, got the livestock safe, left a garrison inside each fortification and destroyed the bridges in order to hinder and to guide their enemies.
Anecdotally, the land of Coucy was spared: its lord Enguerrand VII de Coucy, married to Isabella of England, the eldest daughter of Edward III, did his best to maintain a cautious neutrality.
On 9 September 1373, on the contrary, the French attacked at Oulchy an isolated English corps, killing its captain Walter Hewitt and numerous men, and capturing several knights and squires, of which Thomas Despenser, brother of the Constable of England himself. But no other incident disturbed the first part of the chevauchée: the English closed ranks and the French followed the instructions of Charles V.
Gradually the French troops, taken by surprise by the landing at Calais, were growing stronger: from Harfleur, the Duke Philip of Orléans was coming with the army of the sea.
While John of Gaunt and John of Brittany were invading the Champagne province, burning Vertus, looting and ravaging Hermonville, Ville-Dommange, Le Meix-Tiercelin, Margerie, Epernay and the countryside around Châlons-en-Champagne, Du Guesclin was heading East, via Paris where he talked with the king. Consequently, when the English arrived before Troyes, around September 22, Du Guesclin, Olivier de Clisson, Louis II of Bourbon, the Duke of Burgundy and more than 7,000 men in garrison had been waiting for them for a week. The position was kea: it prevented any English attempt to march on Paris through Gâtinais, as Edward III in his chevauchée of 1359 or to march on Brittany, as Robert Knolles in his chevauchée of 1370. The English left, around September 25. Froissart writes:
Heading south
The two Dukes then went up the Seine, finding a way around the end of September at Gyé-sur-Seine, then heading south to Nivernais.
The French were following the advance of their enemy, in two columns marching in parallel, one on their right flank, the other on their left flank, away of an hour of march from each other. They spent each night in castles or fortified cities, when they English were compelled to bivouacking.
Around October 10, the chevauchée crossed the Loire river at the bridge of Marcigny, leaving behind in Charolais a devastated path. The crossing of the Allier river proved more dangerous, and John of Gaunt was forced to go North West towards Moulins where the old bridge stone was one of the rare ways to cross the river. He was almost captured: Louis I of Bourbon was himself in Souvigny on the western bank, and his garrison was stationed at Moulins. Coming from the south-east, Bertrand du Guesclin was tracking down the English, while on October 18, Philip of Burgundy had taken position at the south-west at Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule, after he had crossed the Loire at Roanne. Finally, the king had urgently called back from Brittany his brother the Duke of Anjou, who was converging north towards the town with his infantry and archers corps. The English narrowly escaped, but they had to abandon plenty of supply wagons.
And the situation got worse at the approach of winter and a poorer countryside: Auvergne, Limousin, Rouergue, Agenais. At the beginning of November, the French lightened their presence: Louis of Anjou went back to Languedoc, Philip of Burgundy disbanded his mercenaries and rejoined his duchy, the infantry of the North returned to its garrisons. The Marshal of Sancerre took the lead of the operations.
In Combrailles and Upper Limousin, John of Gaunt's soldiers found themselves in one of the most inhospitable regions of France in winter: the dense forest, glacial and almost uninhabited doesn't offer more resources for the horses than for the men ; the cold and torrential rain turns the roads into swamps, filling the streams with muddy water. The horsemen of Sancerre harassed the flanks of the column, and the English left behind them a long trail of horses, dead of starvation.
Finally, at the beginning of December 1373, the Duke of Lancaster arrived in the valley of the Corrèze river in Lower Limousin, a region still hostile to the authority of the king of France. He was able to rest there three weeks.
Aftermath
Contrary to his older brother Edward the Black Prince, who had come back from his chevauchée of 1355 with an immense loot, John of Gaunt entered Bordeaux on the last days of 1373 with an army that was only the shadow of its former self five months before. Although no large pitched battle had happened, it was a bitter defeat: half its 30,000 horses had died en route. Two thirds of the wagons had had to be abandoned. 3,000 men had died of cold, disease or starvation, and 3,000 had been killed or captured by the French. Many who had made it to Bordeaux died a few days or months later, Edward Despenser himself died in 1375 from an illness probably contracted during the chevauchée. A great number had been captured by the French, and most of them would still be imprisoned three years later.
In Bordeaux, the situation was critical: the remnants of the chevauchée had doubled the population of the town, who had to endure an epidemic of bubonic plague during that winter. Some knights were even begging in the streets for a bit of food. From London, the money expected to pay the troops wasn't coming, and John of Gaunt could now only count on a sick army, demoralized and depleted by desertion. John IV of Brittany returned by sea to his duchy with a thousand men. At the end of March 1374, Lancaster had to renounce to his project of invasion of Castile, allied to France, despite the support of Peter IV of Aragon, of Gaston III, Count of Foix and of Charles II of Navarre. On April 8 1374, he left for England.

The POWER2, originally named RIOS2, is a processor designed by IBM that implemented the POWER instruction set architecture. The POWER2 was the successor of the POWER1, debuting in September 1993 within IBM's RS/6000 systems. When introduced, the POWER2 was the fastest microprocessor, surpassing the Alpha 21064. When the Alpha 21064A was introduced in 1993, the POWER2 lost the lead and became second. IBM claimed that the performance for a 62.5 MHz POWER2 was 73.3 SPECint92 and 134.6 SPECfp92.
The open source GCC compiler removed support for POWER1 (RIOS) and POWER2 (RIOS2) in the 4.5 release.
Description
Improvements over the POWER1 included enhancements to the POWER instruction set architecture (consisting of new user and system instructions and other system-related features), higher clock rates (55 to 71.5 MHz), an extra fixed point unit and floating point unit, a larger 32 KB instruction cache, and a larger 128 or 256 KB data cache. The POWER2 was a multi-chip design consisting of six or eight semi-custom integrated circuits, depending on the amount of data cache (the 256 KB configuration required eight chips). The partitioning of the design was identical to that of the POWER1: an instruction cache unit chip, a fixed-point unit chip, a floating-point unit chip, a storage control unit chip, and two or four data cache unit chips.
The eight-chip configuration contains a total of 23 million transistors and a total die area of 1,215 mm2. The chips are manufactured by IBM in its 0.72 μm CMOS process, which features a 0.45 μm effective channel length; and one layer of polysilicon and four layers of metal interconnect. The chips are packaged in a ceramic multi-chip module (MCM) that measures 64 mm by 64 mm.
POWER2+
An improved version of the POWER2 optimized for transaction processing was introduced in May 1994 as the POWER2+. Transaction processing workloads benefited from the addition of a L2 cache with capacities of 512 KB, 1 MB and 2 MB. This cache was implemented off-package with industry-standard burst SRAMs. The cache was connected to the POWER2+ via a 64- (for low-end systems) or 128-bit bus (for high-end systems). The cache was direct-mapped, had a 128-byte line size, and was write-through. The cache tags were contained on the storage control unit chip. The POWER2+ has a narrower 64- or 128-bit memory bus and a smaller 64 or 128 KB data cache. As there is less cache, the data cache unit chips are smaller as a result, and the revised storage control unit chip is also smaller. A goal for the six-chip configuration was to reduce cost, and therefore the chips are packaged in a solder ball connect (SBC) package instead of a MCM.

POWER2 Super Chip (P2SC) was released in October 1996 as the successor of the POWER2. It was a single-chip implementation of the eight-chip POWER2, integrating 15 million transistors on a 335 mm2 die manufactured in IBM's 0.29 μm five-layer metal CMOS-6S process. The first version ran at 120 or 135 MHz, nearly twice as fast as the POWER2 at 71.5 MHz, with the memory and I/O buses running at half speed to support the higher clock frequency. IBM claimed that the performance of this version was 5.5 SPECint95_base and 14.5 SPECfp95_base. A faster 160 MHz part fabricated in the 0.25 μm CMOS-6S2 process was announced at the Microprocessor Forum in October 1997.
The P2SC was not a complete copy of the POWER2, the L1 data cache and data translation lookaside buffer (TLB) capacities were halved to 128 KB and 256 entries, respectively, and a rarely used feature that locked entries in the TLB was not implemented in order to fit the original design onto a single die.
The P2SC was succeeded by the POWER3 as IBM's flagship microprocessor on the RS/6000 line in 1998. A notable use of the P2SC was the 30-node IBM Deep Blue supercomputer that beat world champion Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997. However, the computer's chess-playing capabilities were a result of its expert system running on custom VLSI chips, rather than the P2SCs.

Pyaar Ka Bandhan was an Indian television series that aired on Sony TV, based on the story of four siblings who get separated by fate and their reunion. The series premiered on 7 October 2009 and was produced by Ekta Kapoor of Balaji Telefilms.
Plot
The story is about four siblings - Kajol, Sujoy, Deva, and Mishti who are left in an orphanage by their mother Vijoya who is dying of cancer.
15 years later
The siblings have grown up.
The eldest son Deva, now named Millind, works for a famous politician and aspires to be one himself. Millind also serves as the politician's daughter, Devika's, bodyguard.
Kajol, the eldest daughter, now named Prateeksha, becomes the personal secretary to Shashank, a good-hearted, carefree playboy. Prateeksha is still looking for her siblings. Shashank becomes engaged to Suhani who appoints Prateeksha believing Shashank wouldn't flirt with her.
Suhani's step-sister is Araina, Prateeksha's younger sister Mishti, who was adopted by the wealthy Vikram Rai and raised as a spoilt brat. Aziz, previously Sujoy, was adopted by a Muslim couple and now works in Vikram Rai's house as their driver.
Gradually, Shashank changes under Prateeksha's influence, becomes responsible, and falls in love with her. Prateeksha reciprocates his feelings but sacrifices her love for Suhani's sake. Araina, meanwhile, falls in love with the Rais' horse rancher, Raunak.
Aziz finds out that Prateeksha is his older sister Kajol. Prateeksha accidentally overhears him talking to his adoptive mother and is relieved to have found one sibling. Suhani finds out about Shashank and Prateeksha's love and decides to tell everyone but she and Araina meet with an accident that kills Suhani and lands Araina in a coma.
6 months later
Prateeksha is married and has moved to Delhi. Araina recovers from her coma. Prateeksha needs a signature from a minister, now Milind, to build an orphanage. Meanwhile, Devika announces that she will marry Milind. At a party, Araina and Shashank run into Prateeksha who avoids Shashank. Shashank follows her and tries to uncover the details of her married life. Eventually, Araina, Aziz and Shashank discover that Prateeksha is married to Raunak.
Araina decides to take revenge from Prateeksha blaming her for Suhani's death and for taking Raunak away from her. She takes over the company where Raunak works and starts creating problems in his personal and professional life. More deeply in love with Prateeksha, Shashank realises her marriage to Raunak is only for show and discovers a CD in her house but she throws him out. Later, Shashank's father warns Prateeksha to stay awa from him or he would expose the contents of the CD which prove that Suhani's accident was caused by Raunak's car. Prateeksha then leaves for Kolkata.
Aziz, Milind and Araina leave for Kolkata to find their biological mother who survived her illness. Eventually, Aziz, Milind and Prateeksha reconcile with their mother. Araina discovers the truth and drops her evil plans.
Prateeksha and Shashank, Milind and Radha, Araina and Raunak, Aziz and Devika get together, and the four siblings finally reunite.

Sha'ar HaAmakim (, lit. Gate of the Valleys) is a kibbutz in northern Israel associated with the Hashomer Hatzair movement founded in 1935. Located near Kiryat Tiv'on, it falls under the jurisdiction of Zevulun Regional Council. In it had a population of .
History
Antiquity
Human habitation in the area dates at least as far back as the Hellenistic period. Although the site, in recent history, has borne the name of Ḫirbet el-Ḥârithîye, it is thought by modern-day archaeologists to have been the Second Temple-period site known as Geba / Gibea (), based on Josephus' description of distances between Geba and Simonias and Beit She'arim (Roman-era Jewish village) in Lower Galilee.
Crusades
In 1283, during the hudna ("truce") between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur Qalawun, this location was named el Harathiyah and was described as part of the domain of the Crusaders.
Ottoman rule
During the Ottoman era, a Muslim village at the site was named el Hâritheh. The village appeared as El Harti on the map of Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799. In 1859, the population was recorded as 120 with tillable land of 12 feddans. In 1875, Victor Guérin reported about 40 houses. In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described it as an adobe hamlet.
A population list from about 1887 showed that Harithiyeh had about 120 inhabitants; all Muslims.
British Mandate
In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, the Al Zubaidat, who cultivated the Hartieh land, numbered 363, all Muslims.
The area was acquired by the Jewish community as part of the Sursock Purchase. In 1925 a Zionist organisation purchased 50 feddans in Hartieh from the Sursock family of Beirut. At the time, there were 60 families living there. In the 1931 census, the Arab Zubeidat was counted under the Shefa-'Amr suburbs.
From 1931, and lasting several years, the Jewish Agency struggled to evict the Arab El Zubeidat, who were tenant farmers at Hartiya. According to Avneri, Hartiya land was to become Sha'ar HaAmakim.
According to the Department of Statistics, however, Sha'ar HaAmakim had previously been part of Sheikh Bureik.
Kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim was founded in 1935 by immigrants from Romania and Yugoslavia. One of its founders was Aharon Cohen, later to be convicted of spying for the Soviet Union. Its name was derived from the nearby confluence of the Jezreel and Zevulun valleys. By the 1945 statistics it had a population of 360, all Jews.
State of Israel
Sha'ar HaAmakim hosted volunteers from around the world, including France and the United States, who worked at the kibbutz and participated in cultural exchanges. In the 1960s, there were up to 100 volunteers each year. Bernie Sanders spent time at the kibbutz for several months in 1963.
Economy
According to a 2016 report, the kibbutz derives most of its income from its solar water heater factory. Additional sources of income include agriculture, such as dairy farming. For over five decades, the kibbutz has produced and processed sunflower seeds which it markets under its name both in Israel and for export. It also has a fish pond and orchards producing apples, peaches, and pears.

Erwin Wurm (born 1954) is an Austrian artist. He lives and works in Vienna and Limberg in Austria, and in New York City.
Early life
Erwin Wurm was born in Bruck an der Mur, Austria, in 1954. His father was a detective, who did not approve of artists.
Philosophy and themes
In The Artist Who Swallowed the World, Wurm is quoted as saying: "I am interested in the everyday life. All the materials that surrounded me could be useful, as well as the objects, topics involved in contemporary society. My work speaks about the whole entity of a human being: the physical, the spiritual, the psychological and the political."
Wurm is known for his humorous approach to formalism. About the use of humor in his work, Wurm says in an interview: "If you approach things with a sense of humor, people immediately assume you're not to be taken seriously. But I think truths about society and human existence can be approached in different ways. You don't always have to be deadly serious. Sarcasm and humor can help you see things in a lighter vein."
Wurm's work is often critical of Western society and the mentality and lifestyle of his childhood during post-World War II Austria. Although Wurm's sculptures are humorous and ridiculous, they are actually quite serious. His criticism is playful, but should not be confused with kindness. He represents his criticism of objects, such as clothing, furniture, cars, houses, and everyday objects to his audience. Common themes in his work include not only our relationship to banal everyday objects, but also philosophers and life in postwar Austria.
In talking about his often-mentioned topics of the gaining and losing of body weight and philosophy, Wurm stated: "It's about the difficulty to cope with life. Whether with diet or with a philosophy".
Art practice
Wurm lives and works in Vienna and Limberg in Austria, and sometimes in New York.
Selected works
One Minute Sculptures
Since the late 1980s, he has developed an ongoing series of One Minute Sculptures, in which he poses himself or his models in unexpected relationships with everyday objects close at hand, prompting the viewer to question the very definition of sculpture. He seeks to use the "shortest path" in creating a sculpture—a clear and fast, sometimes humorous, form of expression. As the sculptures are fleeting and meant to be spontaneous and temporary, the images are only captured in photos or on film.
Fat Car series
Wurm believes the creation of sculpture is adding and subtracting material to an object. In his works, he does so by layering clothes over each other, or items represented as fat, obese, or inflated.
Wurm has worked on a series of sculptures titled Fat Car, which depict "puffy, obese, life-size sculptures that bulge like overfilled sacks". The first of his Fat Car series was developed with Opel designers, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the kind of shape that Wurm had in mind due to technical limitations of this time. In order to create the desired look of fatness, the artist uses polyurethane foam and styrofoam covered with lacquer. Wurm has also produced a Fat House at near full scale.
20 years after his first Fat Car and as one of the first internationally established artists Wurm released a 15-second long video in August 2021 called Breathe In, Breathe Out as an NFT via König gallery's MISA website based on the FLOW blockchain. The sequence shows a pan loop around a seemingly breathing, red Porsche in a green landscape. The idea for this work dates back to the time of the first Fat Car and the collaboration with Opel.
Narrow House
Erwin Wurm "shrank" his parents' house to reflect the mentality of Austria during the postwar period; the design of the house is typical of the 1950s, but a fraction of the width. The house is furnished with shrunken furniture. This piece was inspired by Wurm's childhood, since he grew up during the 1950s through 1970s in postwar Austria. Growing up, he lived with his parents; his mother stayed at home and his father was a policeman.
From Men's Size 38 to Size 48 in Eight Days
Erwin Wurm's displayed work From Men's Size 38 to Size 48 in Eight Days are pages from his instruction book that explains Wurm's daily diet and activities each day in order to increase his body mass tremendously over the week. The book contains short advice such as, "day nap", "breathe deeply", "read or lay near an open window". The mounted photos also include various advice, from meal content to room temperature, in order to expedite extreme weight gain. Many of the unhealthy meal plans include things like, "two bottles of beer for lunch, one litre of red wine for dinner, and rich Austrian sweet recipes, like scheiterhaufen (also known as Žemlovka), as a full-on course". Wurm believes that gaining or losing weight is a medium of sculptural work. Similar to his One Minute Sculptures, Erwin Wurm uses the human body to provide the material to make this sculpture. The artist's intention for the audience is to feel as if their bodies are filled with the food from reading the instruction book and become the sculptures themselves. It serves as a comeback to self-help books that idealize a slender, healthy body. Wurm's artistic process of utilizing the human body with the live-action event as a medium, serves as a fundamental meaning-making practice for artists all over the world.
Recognition and honours
2013: Grand Austrian State Prize
2021: 59th GNMH Award
2022: Honorary doctorate from the University of Belgrade.
Collections and exhibitions
Erwin Wurm's works are in collections worldwide, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Walker Art Center, Museum Ludwig, , Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon, Museum of Old and New Art, and the Centre Pompidou.
In popular culture
In the Red Hot Chili Peppers 2003 music video "Can't Stop" the members of the band carry out five of Wurm's One Minute Sculptures. At the end of the video, a sign states that Wurm was an inspiration for the video. In a recent iTunes interview, Flea is quoted as saying Wurm's picture of a man with a pencil in his nose was a significant influence on the video (Flea himself appears in the video, at a certain point, with markers in his nostrils, pencils in his ears, and paint pot caps over his eyes). Wurm is considered to be the first visual artist to receive credits in a music video on MTV.

Tonkin Island () is a narrow, ice-capped island in Antarctica. It is 3.5 nautical miles (6 km) long in a north-south direction, marked by ice-free peaks at each end, lying 11 nautical miles (20 km) southeast of Choyce Point, Bowman Coast, in Larsen Ice Shelf. The island was discovered and photographed from the air by the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) in 1940. It was charted by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1947 and named after John E. Tonkin, FIDS general assistant at Stonington Island, 1945–47; named Lewis Island by Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE) following additional aerial photography, 1947. The names Isla Mateo de Toro Zambrano and Isla Riquelme, referring to the north and south parts of this feature shown as two islands, appear on a Chilean hydrographic chart, 1947.

Merchant International Group (MIG) was a privately owned British strategic research and corporate intelligence company with offices in London, Hong Kong and Vienna.
History
Merchant International Group was established in 1982 by Stuart Poole-Robb and Alan Bailey who had both previously served in the UK military. Peter Davies, a former Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche Bank banker served as the companies chairman from 2002. The group had an advisory board made up of a number of prominent former public servants including Sir Graham Boyce the former ambassador to Kuwait, and Baroness Chalker of Wallasey. Sir John Wheeler, the former Conservative politician who served as Northern Ireland security minister, served as a non-executive director.
Services
The company worked for a number of UK based multinationals including Cadbury Schweppes, Legal & General, and Kingfisher plc. The company worked with over half the FTSE 100 and 150 of the Fortune 500. MIG also provided global risk research to the World Bank. MIG developed a framework that identified ten categories of Grey Area Dynamics™. Each refers to a range of events, activities and trends that impact upon business.
It provided data to Transparency International alongside the Asia Development Bank, World Economic Forum, and Economist Intelligence Unit to compile its Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
MIG produced the Marine Piracy Threat Assessment which modelled piracy risks in various parts of the world and was featured each month in the shipping journal Lloyd's List. The reports were some of the first to highlight the statistical increase in global piracy and as a result drew criticism from some parts of the shipping industry for damaging the reputation of some countries and pushing up the cost of insuring vessels entering piracy zones.
Awards
Merchant International Group won the European Service Provider of the Year, 1999-2000 at the European Risk Management Awards magazine International Risk Management. In 2004, the company won an award for Product of the Year from StrategicRisk.

A cumulative flow diagram is a tool used in queuing theory. It is an area graph that depicts the quantity of work in a given state, showing arrivals, time in queue, quantity in queue, and departure.
Cumulative flow diagrams are seen in the literature of agile software development and lean product development. They are also seen in transportation.
Some people consider a cumulative flow diagram to be a more sophisticated version of a "burn up chart", which is the opposite of a burn down chart. A burn down chart tracks work remaining over time while burn up charts like the CFD track the growth (or shrinkage) of work in certain states over time. In agile software development, when teams use kanban methodology, the cumulative flow diagram shows the number of active items in each column on a kanban board. The ideal cumulative flow diagram has each line in the cumulative flow diagram trends upwards constantly. With its focus on tracking changes in queue size per state, the CFD has a stronger focus on identifying and rooting out the causes of dramatic changes in throughput.
Another term is "cumulative input-output diagram". The term "Newell curve" is also used, in reference to Gordon F. Newell. It is not known if Newell originated the curve.

Moler is an orchestral work written by the American composer Arlene Sierra. The work was commissioned by the Seattle Symphony, Ludovic Morlot, Music Director. It was first performed at Benaroya Hall on October 26, 2012.
Composition
Background
Moler was commissioned by the Seattle Symphony as part of Sonic Evolution project: A showcase of new works from the younger generation of composers that would take inspiration, but no quotations, from popular music with a Seattle connection. Sierra composed “Moler” — Spanish for “to grind” — after selecting Alice In Chains' 1995 hit “Grind” as the inspiration for her contribution. Sierra states, “The band has a hard, visceral sound, which is something I try to do with my orchestral music,... I expected ‘Grind' to be sexy, but it's about anxiety. So I was imagining the orchestra's teeth grinding in a certain way.”
Structure
Moler is a single-movement orchestral work with a duration of approximately nine minutes.
The title is Spanish for “to grind,” and the piece was inspired by the composer's habit of grinding her teeth while sleeping. Moler is a dance-infused piece that uses the “grinding” idea to suggest unusual combinations of instrumental timbres and textures. Its overall musical narrative was partly suggested by the varying tensions and relaxations of sleep and dreaming.
The composer writes:
Moler is the Spanish word for “grind,” and this work takes its compositional impulses from a particular form of grinding, bruxism, that is the involuntary phenomenon of teeth grinding that occurs during sleep. When reading about bruxism I came across medical research that revealed that a sleeper's heart rate increases with the onset of bruxism and that fluctuations coincided with phases of dreaming. Using the resources of a large orchestra, Moler replicates these characteristics, together with associated qualities of roughness, nervousness, and energy. Reflecting the relationship between bruxism and sleep patterns, the music shifts its energy levels, sometimes abruptly, between the frenetic and the relaxed, and back again. In addition to rhythmic parameters, orchestral motifs are made to “grind” against each other with starkly contrasting pitch and timbral materials. Timbral roughness is achieved through various contrasts including the pairing of muted trombones with low oboes, using flutter-tonguing in the brass, glissando effects in the timpani, and giving solo material to instruments including contrabassoon and muted bass trombone, among other orchestrational and compositional choices. A constant, quick pulse is implicitly present throughout Moler, but syncopations and gaps in the texture add instability and drama. A two-note motif, short-long, and its slightly longer short-short-long version recur throughout. Otherwise the surface of the music constantly changes via orchestration and dynamics. Strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion, deployed in distinct layers or in combinations of instrumental sections, vie for the foreground. Sharp attacks in piano and percussion are offset by sustained music in strings or winds, low sounds contrast with high, unpitched with pitched, all coming together in a satisfying, powerful narrative.
Instrumentation
Moler calls for two flutes and piccolo, two oboes and English horn, two clarinets and bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, tuba, percussion (two players: marimba, vibraphone, crotales, ratchet, cowbell, suspended cymbal, tam-tam, gongs [medium and high], woodblocks [medium and high], sand blocks, guiro, vibraslap, glockenspiel, snare drum, bass drum), timpani, harp, and strings
Reception
In 2014, Moler was nominated for Best Contemporary Classical Composition in the Latin GRAMMY awards.
Moler appears on Sierra's second portrait CD with Bridge Records, Game of Attrition: Arlene Sierra, Vol. 2, released in 2014 that includes four orchestral works recorded by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Jac Van Steen, conductor. As part of his review of the orchestral disc, Simon Cummings described Moler as "surely one of the best concert-openers of recent years."

Abed Chaudhury (born February 1956) is an Australian-Bangladeshi scientist, author, and poet living in Australia.
Early life and education
He was born into a Bengali Muslim family known as the Zamindars of Kanihati in Hajipur Union, Kulaura, Moulvibazar District. The family trace their origin to Shah Halim ad-Din Narnauli, a 14th-century Arab missionary who settled in the area. His father was Abdul Mannan (Ibrahim) Chaudhury and mother was Hafiza Khatun.
Chaudhury was a student at the Moulvibazar Government High School, before proceeding to study at the Notre Dame College of Dhaka. Completing his bachelor's degree in chemistry from Dhaka University, Chaudhury got his PhD from University of Oregon and did post-doctoral research at National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, and was a visiting scientist at École Normale Supérieure in France.
Work in science
Chaudhury is a well-known geneticist and writer in both Bengali and English who together with colleagues in Australia isolated the FIS (fertilization independent seed) genes; fis mutants can produce partial seed without fertilization. These are the first characterised genes involved in apomixis, a method of making seed without the father. Earlier in the USA he did seminal work on gene-targeting and in development of Arabidopsis as a model organism. He established broad areas of research in Plant Biology by deciphering the genetic pathway of male fertility, seed size, and the role of epigenetics in seed development.
He is currently the Head of Scientific Innovation at LoamBio based in Australia. Earlier in his career he worked at National Institute of Health of the USA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ecole Normale Superieure, CSIRO, Vitagrain and Syngenta. Chaudhury has established Krishan a new farmer-led innovation platform for increasing biodiversity and generation of climate-compliant crop. He is an author of numerous scientific publications as well as non-fiction books and several books of poetry in both Bangla and English.
leading a group of scientists in Australia in his research.
Chaudhury is currently living in Australia.

Roger Laurance Mayer (April 21, 1926 – March 24, 2015) was an American film industry executive. He was best known for his efforts on behalf of film preservation and for his support of the film industry's humanitarian charity, the Motion Picture & Television Fund. In 2004 he was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.
Biography
Mayer was born in Manhattan. He attended the Horace Mann School. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II era. After the war, he received his bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1948, and a law degree from Yale Law School in 1951. He moved to Los Angeles and sought a position at one of the city's major downtown law firms, but was rejected, being told that those firms didn't hire Jews. He was eventually hired as a lawyer at Columbia Pictures, where he worked for nine years. He then moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (He is not related to MGM founder Louis B. Mayer.) He established an early film preservation program at the studio, at a time when such efforts were not seen as financially rewarding, and eventually rose to become President of MGM Laboratories.
In 1986 Mayer became president and chief executive of Turner Entertainment. In that position, he was responsible for managing the large library of motion pictures that Ted Turner had purchased from MGM, including high-profile restorations and re-releases of landmark MGM films like Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, as well as being a focus of controversy when he supported Ted Turner's decision to colorize some old black-and-white films in the library.
Mayer became a founder and chair of the National Film Preservation Foundation in 1996. In that capacity, he was credited with enabling the preservation of more than 2,000 orphan films, films whose original copyright had expired or otherwise lacked commercial potential sufficient to pay for their preservation. He also sat on the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress. In addition, Mayer also served as chairman of the Motion Picture & Television Fund, an industry charity that provides healthcare and social services.
Awards
Mayer, Rick Schmidlin, and Turner Classic Movies shared a 1999 special citation from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association for their role in the "re-creation and presentation" of the 1924 film Greed (film) directed by Erich Von Stroheim. The Hollywood Film Awards honored Mayer for his preservation work in 2003. In 2004 Mayer won an Emmy Award for the TV documentary Judy Garland: By Myself, which he is executive produced for American Masters.
In 2005, Mayer was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in recognition of his efforts for film preservation and for the Motion Picture & Television Fund. At the 77th Academy Awards ceremony, Mayer's Hersholt Award was presented by film director Martin Scorsese, who had been one of Mayer's critics on the colorization issue, but who praised Mayer for his preservation work.
Personal life
Mayer married Pauline Alexander in 1952; they remained married until his death. They had two children. He died after suffering a heart attack in his doctor's office in Los Angeles on March 24, 2015.

Vila Pouca de Aguiar () is a municipality in the district of Vila Real in northern Portugal. Its population in 2011 was 13,187, in an area of 437.07 km². It has about 3,456 residents.
History
There are various theories on the munipality's origins. Some historians believe it was the successor to the ancient city of Cauca, governed by Emperor Theodosius I; however, it is uncertain why or when its name would have been changed from Cauca to Pouca. Another theory is that "Vila Pouca" referred to a small agrarian community, and that "Aguiar" referred to an ancient administrative region, to disambiguate it from other communities named Vila Pouca. Although the name means "Vila Pouca of Aguiar", "aguiar" is derived from aquila ("where the eagles are").
In the 13th century, the municipality was part of the land of Aguiar. In the 12 and 13th centuries, Aguiar consisted of seven ecclesiastical parishes, including São Salvador de Jugal, which corresponded to the actual parish of Vila Pouca de Aguiar. The Inquirições (inquiries/inventory) of King Afonso II established that the parochia of São Salvador de Jugal was composed of these localities and towns: Condado (three couples); Calvos (one couple); Guilhado (four couples) and Nuzedo (20 couples), in addition to the towns of Fraengo and Outeiro. The document also identifies Jugal as an administrative unit, with elaborated administrative domain over the territory of Aguiar, and where the parochial church was located, but no reference to Jugal as a town.
There is no historical explanation for the name-change from São Salvador de Jugal to Vila Pouca, nor when it occurred, although it was sometime in the 14th century.
In the early 20th century, the area's leading figure was Martiniano José Ferreira Botelho, a doctor, druggist, and politician known for his humanitarian character and his advocacy of the local medicinal waters for treatments. He and his family donated land to the community for the current market square, municipal slaughterhouse and well.
Geography
Integrated into the Alto Tâmega subregion, the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar is situated in the north of the district of Vila Real, between the mountains of Serra do Alvão and Serra da Padrela, extending over a territory of approximately 437 km². It is located within a strategic connection, not just between other Portuguese municipalities in the interior but also, as a transit point to the coastal areas (across the A7 and A24 motorways). Within a long fertile valley, and surrounded by high pasture-lands, it is defensively safe within the Transmontana escarpments. The region is covered in national monuments and historical structures: the Castle of Aguiar da Pena, the millenarian Roman mining complex of Tresminas, the thermals of Pedras Salgadas, several leisure centres (such as the Falperra Dam/Reservoir), the Dolmens of Alvão, churches, graves/funeral sites, medieval bridges, sun-dials and castro dot the landscape of this unassuming region.
It is located in a narrow valley 25 kilometers north of the district capital, Vila Real, and is connected to the same by national N2 highway.
In 2006 the A7 toll road to Guimarães was completed and the last stretch of the A24, connecting Vila Pouca with Vila Real was opened in June 2007. This non-toll four-lane highway links Coimbra with the Spanish border in Vila Verde. One of the longest and highest highway bridges in Europe was built just south of Vila Pouca, carrying traffic across the fertile valley.
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (freguesias):
Alfarela de Jales
Alvão
Bornes de Aguiar
Bragado
Capeludos
Pensalvos e Parada de Monteiros
Sabroso de Aguiar
Soutelo de Aguiar
Telões
Tresminas
Valoura

Vreia de Bornes

Vila Pouca de Aguiar has for many years experienced the desertification of the Portuguese interior. Population densities have historically identified a strong concentration of people in the municipal seat, or its peripheral parishes. From 1981 to 1991, the parishes of Bragado, Pensalves, Afonsim, Vreia de Jales, Vreia de Bornes, Valoura and Soutelo de Aguiar have registered flawing population growth rates. The parish of Sabroso de Aguiar did not exist in 1981, but by 1991 it registered the highest population concentration in the region. Comparatively, between 1991 and 2001, there were no changes in population densities in many of the parishes. The municipal seat and Sabroso de Aguiar continue to show a growth in population density.
Climate
Twin towns – Sister cities
Vila Pouca de Aguiar is twinned with:
Fabero del Bierzo, El Bierzo, Province of León, Spain
Economy
Part of region characterized by fertile soils, and the typical climate of the Terra Fria Transmontana, the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar is essentially subsistence agricultural, cultivating cereal crops, potato, vegetables and supporting some vineyards. The small valleys support cattle which graze in the open pasturelands. The lands of the Alvão valley benefited from the construction of the Alvão Dam/Reservoir, which allowed irrigation of these lands since the mid-20th century.
In addition, the economy supports small service industries, government-based dominated tertiary employment, the granite extraction industry (concentrated in the mines of Jales) and the mineral waters in Pedras Salgadas, a small spa town located about ten kilometers north on the main highway to Chaves.

The Nebelwerfer (smoke mortar) was a World War II German series of weapons. They were initially developed by and assigned to the Wehrmacht's "smoke troops" (Nebeltruppen). This weapon was given its name as a disinformation strategy designed to fool observers from the League of Nations, who were observing any possible infraction of the Treaty of Versailles, into thinking that it was merely a device for creating a smoke screen. They were primarily intended to deliver poison gas and smoke shells, although a high-explosive shell was developed for the Nebelwerfer from the beginning. Initially, two different mortars were fielded before they were replaced by a variety of rocket launchers ranging in size from . The thin walls of the rockets had the great advantage of allowing much larger quantities of gases, fluids or high explosives to be delivered than artillery or even mortar shells of the same weight. With the exception of the Balkans Campaign, Nebelwerfer were used in every campaign of the German Army during World War II. A version of the 21 cm calibre system was adapted for air-to-air use against Allied bombers.
Weapons
10 cm Nebelwerfer 35
The lower muzzle velocity of a mortar meant that its shell walls could be thinner than those of artillery shells, and it could carry a larger payload than artillery shells of the same weight. This made it an attractive delivery system for poison gases. The U.S. Army's Chemical Warfare Service developed their 4.2 inch chemical mortar for precisely that reason and the Nebeltruppen shared that reasoning. Its first weapon was also a mortar, the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 35, which was designed in 1934.
10 cm Nebelwerfer 40
Almost from the beginning, the army wanted more range than the 10 cm NbW 35's , but troop trials of two prototypes did not take place until May 1940. Neither was entirely satisfactory, but the best features of both were incorporated into the 10 cm Nebelwerfer 40. This was a very advanced breech-loading weapon with a recoil mechanism and an integral wheeled carriage. It had twice the range of its predecessor, but was eight times the weight and cost nearly ten times as much: vs .
15 cm Nebelwerfer 41
Rocket development had begun during the 1920s and reached fruition in the late thirties. This offered the opportunity for the Nebeltruppen to deliver large quantities of poison gas or smoke simultaneously. The first weapon to be delivered to the troops was the 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41 in 1940, after the Battle of France, a purpose-designed rocket with gas, smoke and high-explosive warheads. It, like virtually all German rocket designs, was spin-stabilized to increase accuracy. One very unusual feature was that the rocket motor was in the front, the exhaust venturi being about two-thirds down the body from the nose, with the intent to optimize the blast effect of the rocket as the warhead would still be above the ground when it detonated. This proved to greatly complicate manufacture for not much extra effect and it was not copied on later rocket designs. It was fired from a six-tube launcher mounted on a towed carriage adapted from that used by the 3.7 cm PaK 36 and had a range of . Almost five and a half million 15 cm rockets and 6,000 launchers were manufactured over the course of the war.
28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41
The 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 rockets were introduced in 1941, before Operation Barbarossa. They used the same motor, but carried different warheads. The rocket had a HE warhead, while the rockets were incendiary. The maximum range for either rocket was only , a severe tactical drawback. Both could be fired from their wooden packing cases or a special wooden (schweres Wurfgerät 40 – heavy missile device) or tubular metal (schweres Wurfgerät 41 (sW.G. 41)) frame. Later, a towed launcher was developed that could take six rockets. Both rockets used the same launchers, but special liner rails had to be used for the rockets. A vehicular launch frame, the schwere Wurfrahmen 40 (sWu.R. 40), was also designed to improve the mobility of the heavy rockets. These were normally mounted on the sides of Sd.Kfz. 251 half-tracks, but they were also adapted for several different captured French tracked vehicles. The sWuR 40 was nicknamed the Stuka-zu-Fuß ("Stuka on Foot"). Over six hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers, excluding the sW.G. and sWu.R. firing frames, were made during the war. In total, 345 launchers were built from 1941.
21 cm Nebelwerfer 42
The 21 cm Nebelwerfer 42 rocket, which was introduced in 1942, had a longer range () and a simpler design than the smaller 15 cm rocket. It was only made with high-explosive warheads and was fired from a five-tube launcher that used the same carriage as the smaller weapon. Liner rails were used to allow it to fire the smaller 15 cm rocket. It was also adapted for use by the Luftwaffe to break up Allied bomber formations in 1943 as the Werfer-Granate 21. Over four hundred thousand rockets and 1,400 launchers were completed.
30 cm Nebelwerfer 42
The last German-designed rocket to be introduced was the 30 cm Nebelwerfer 42 in 1943. This was intended to replace the 28 and 32 cm rockets, which had to short a range. Advances in propellant chemistry also reduced its smoke signature. It could be fired from all of the same platforms as the older rockets and many of the older launchers were converted to be used with the newer rocket by installing adapter rails, although it also had its own purpose-designed launcher, the 30 cm Raketenwerfer 56. Fewer than two hundred thousand rockets and 700 launchers were built during the war.
8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer
The Waffen-SS decided to copy the Soviet M-8 Katyusha rocket launcher as the 24-rail 8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer. Its fin-stabilized rockets were cheaper and easier to manufacture than the German spin-stabilized designs and used cheaper launch rails. It was also capable of using the considerable stocks of captured Soviet rockets. Separate production lines were set up under party control as the army refused to convert any of its existing factories, but not many actually appear to have been made. Production quantities are unknown, but photographic evidence shows the launcher mounted on lightly armored versions of the Sd.Kfz. 4 "Maultier" and captured French SOMUA MCG half-track.
Panzerwerfer
To improve the mobility of the Nebelwerfer units, a ten-tube launcher was mounted on a lightly armored Sd.Kfz. 4 "Maultier" half-track chassis as the 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz. 4/1 (based on the Opel "Maultier", or "Mule", half-track). Three hundred of these were produced, split evenly between launchers and ammunition carriers (which were identical except for the launcher). These were superseded in production by the 15 cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Schwerer Wehrmachtsschlepper (Panzerwerfer auf SWS), which had improved cross-country mobility and had greater ammunition storage than the "Maultier". The exact number built of the latter weapon is unknown, but evidence suggests that fewer than 100 were completed before the end of the war.
Air-to-air adaptation (Werfer-Granate 21 rockets)
The Werfergranate 21 (Wfr. Gr. 21), also called the 21 cm BR (BR believed to be the abbreviation for "Bordrakete" in official Luftwaffe manuals) was an unguided air-to-air rocket version of the projectile used in the Nebelwerfer 42 and was first used in the defense of Schweinfurt on 17 August 1943. The Wfr. Gr. 21 was mounted on Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters (one launch tube under each wing) and on the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Messerschmitt Me 410 heavy fighters (two launch tubes under each wing) and was the first air-to-air rocket used by the Luftwaffe. Photographic evidence indicates that the Hungarians fitted three tubes under each wing of some of their twin-engined Me 210 Ca-1 heavy fighters. The rockets were used to break up Allied bomber combat box formations in order to enable more effective German fighter attacks against the scattered Allied aircraft. However, the high drag caused by the launchers reduced the speed and maneuverability of the launching aircraft, a handicap that could prove fatal if Allied fighters were encountered. Also, the launch tube's underwing mounting setup, which usually aimed the projectile at about 15° upwards from level flight to counter the considerable ballistic drop of the projectile in flight after launch, added to the drag problem.
One experimental fitment trial program of up to 33 of the 21 cm rockets, meant to be fired from a single aircraft in an upwards direction (much like the Schräge Musik upward firing autocannon on German Nachtjäger night fighters) was proposed for the Heinkel He 177A as the Grosszerstörer, mounted in the central fuselage and flying below American combat box bomber formations to down them, but the quintet of He 177A-5 airframes set aside for the Grosszerstörer program only flew as experimental airframes, seeing no active combat deployment.
Use in combat
After the crew had loaded and aimed the launcher, they had to take cover away to avoid the exhaust flames, and would fire the rockets with an electric switch. After firing, however, a long streak of smoke was visible from a considerable distance, leaving the Nebelwerfer vulnerable to counter-battery fire. It was therefore necessary to relocate the launcher and crew as soon as possible after firing. The loud, shrill howling noise of the incoming rockets led Allied soldiers in the Sicily campaign to give it the nicknames "Screaming Mimi" and "Moaning Minnie".
Organization
Generally, mortars of the Nebeltruppen were organized into batteries of six or eight mortars, three batteries per battalion. The towed rocket launchers had six launchers per battery, three batteries per battalion. Usually, three battalions formed a regiment. Midway through the war brigades were formed, each with two regiments. A regiment was sometimes reinforced with a Panzerwerfer battery of 6-8 vehicles. From 1942, their designations changed from Nebelwerfer to simply Werfer.
As part of its general expansion, the Waffen-SS began to form its own Werfer units in 1943, although they never formed any unit bigger than a battalion. These were organized much the same as their Army counterparts.
Organizational history
The 1st, 2nd and 5th Nebelwerfer Battalions, each equipped with 24 10 cm Nbw 35 mortars in three batteries, were ready when the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939. The 1st and 2nd Battalions participated in that campaign, while the 5th remained in Western Germany. One battery of Artillery Regiment 222 was converted to 10 cm NbW 35s and participated in the Norwegian Campaign. By May 1940, five more battalions had been formed, all equipped with 10 cm NbW 35 mortars, filling out the sequence from 1 to 8, but only the first five were combat ready when the Battle of France began on 10 May 1940.
The first 15 cm NbW 41 rocket launchers were delivered in July 1940, forming three new regiments, the 51st, 52nd and 53rd Nebelwerfer Regiments, each with three battalions. The 54th Regiment was formed from the 1st and 7th Nebelwerfer Battalions. The Nebel-Lehr Regiment was formed from the Nebeltruppen school in Celle on 29 April 1941 with two battalions, one each with 10 cm NbW 35 mortars and 15 cm NbW 41 rockets. The independent Nebelwerfer Battalions retained their mortars with the exception of the 8th, which received rockets before Operation Barbarossa. The only way of differentiating those units equipped with mortars during this period from those with rockets being the "d." or "do." suffix added to the designations of the rocket-equipped units. Beginning in November 1941, the eight Decontamination Battalions were fully equipped with 28/32 cm NbW 41 rockets (some had sW.G. 40 and 41 launching frames earlier) and reorganized into three Heavy Werfer Regiments.
During early 1942, the 10th Mountain Werfer Battalion was formed from the 104th Decontamination Battalion and sent to 20th Mountain Army in Finland. In late 1943, Werfer-Battalion 11 was organized from two batteries already in Finland, including the battery from Artillery Regiment 222 that participated in the invasion of Norway. A new Panzerwerfer battery was sent from Germany to be its third battery at the same time. Both battalions retreated into Northern Norway after the Finnish armistice in September 1944 after the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive.
The 9th Nebelwerfer Battalion was given rockets, redesignated as the first battalion of Werfer-Regiment 71 and sent to North Africa late that year. Most of the second battalion were sent to Tunisia in early 1943, where it surrendered in May. The remainder of the regiment fought in Sicily and mainland Italy for the rest of the war.
Panzerwerfer batteries began to reinforce the Werfer Regiments beginning in mid-1943 and the regiments were paired into brigades beginning in early 1944. In late 1944, the brigades were redesignated as Volks-Werfer Brigades although no organizational changes occurred. A total of fifteen Werfer and Volks-Werfer Brigades were formed, plus one Positional Werfer Brigade (Stellungs-Werfer-Brigade) during the war.

The Quebec University Football League was the Canadian football conference for Quebec universities who participate in CIS football until the completion of the 2010 football season. It has since been renamed Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec football, or noted by the acronym RSEQ.
The champion is awarded the Dunsmore Cup and moves on to compete in a national semi-final Bowl game against one of the other three CIS football conferences. It is governed by the Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec.
The present constitution of the RSEQ was founded in 2001, following the departure of Queen's University and University of Ottawa from the Ontario-Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference (OQIFC). First simply known as the Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference (QIFC), it was renamed the Quebec University Football League (Ligue de football universitaire du Québec) in 2004.
History
The history of university football in Quebec goes back to the early foundations of football in Canada. The earliest interuniversity football league was the Canadian Intercollegiate Rugby Football Union (CIRFU) which was formed in late 1897 and began competition in 1898. The CIRFU competed for the Yates Cup, donated by H. B. Yates of McGill University in 1898 and awarded to the league champion annually. Teams competing since that first year were McGill Redmen, Queen's Golden Gaels, and the Toronto Varsity Blues. In following years, they were joined by Ottawa Gee-Gees (1905–1912), Royal Military College (1913), Western Ontario Mustangs (1929–1970), McMaster Marauders (1952–1953, 1968–1970), and Waterloo Warriors (1968–1970). In addition, beginning in 1953, the Bishop's Gaiters, Collège Militaire Royal, Loyola College Warriors, Macdonald College Aggies, and St. Patrick's College (part of the University of Ottawa but team amalgamated with Carleton Ravens in 1967) joined a new Ottawa-St.Lawrence Intercollegiate Athletic Association.
In 1971, intercollegiate sport in Central Canada completely re-organised with the division of athletic associations along provincial lines and the Quebec University Athletic Association (QUAA) was formed but collapsed following the 1973 season. In 1974, the remaining football teams from the Ontario and Quebec provincial associations were combined into the new Ontario-Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference (OQIFC) with East and West Divisions. All Quebec-based teams were in the East along with Carleton Ravens, Ottawa Gee-Gees, Queen's Golden Gaels, and, for the 1974 and 1975 seasons, Toronto Varsity Blues.
In 1980, the OQIFC re-organised again and the West division became the Ontario Universities Athletics Association and the East division retained the Ontario-Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference name without the need of a division.
Following the 2000 season, the University of Ottawa and Queen's University withdrew from the OQIFC and joined the OUA football conference leaving the OQIFC with only Quebec teams so it became known as the Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference (QIFC). In 2004, the QIFC was formally renamed the Quebec University Football League (QUFL).

The 1907 Sewanee Tigers football team represented Sewanee: The University of the South during the 1907 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association football season. The team competed in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) and was coached by Arthur G. Erwin in his first year as head coach, compiling a record of 8–1 (6–1 SIAA) and outscoring opponents 250 to 29. Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin in Spalding's Football Guide's summation of the season in the SIAA wrote "The standing. First, Vanderbilt; second, Sewanee, a might good second;" and that Aubrey Lanier "came near winning the Vanderbilt game by his brilliant dashes after receiving punts."
Sewanee lost the effective SIAA championship game to Vanderbilt on a double pass play then thrown near the end zone by Bob Blake to Stein Stone. Honus Craig then ran in the winning touchdown. It was just the second year of the legal forward pass. The trick play was cited by Grantland Rice as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports. Innis Brown later wrote "Sewanee in all probability had the best team in the South."

Catherine Plunkett (born c 1725), was an eighteenth century Irish violinist.
Biography
She was born in Dublin about 1725. Plunkett studied with Matthew Dubourg and performed in London and Dublin about 1744. She was one of the very few Irish women to perform as a violinist on stage in the eighteenth century. Very little more is known about her.
In 1818 a Stradivarius cello was bought by Mr Alan Dowell, the "son of Ms Catherine Plunkett". This "Irish" cello turned up in London and is now owned by Carlos Prieto.

The tsort program is a command line utility on Unix and Unix-like platforms, that performs a topological sort on its input. , it is part of the POSIX.1 standard.
History
According to its info page, this command was initially written for providing an ordering of object files that allowed the linker to process them sequentially (each one exactly once, and in order). The FreeBSD manual page dates its appearance to Version 7 Unix.
Note that the following description is describing the behaviour of the FreeBSD implementation of tsort and mentions GNU features where they may exist. Other implementations or versions may differ.
Syntax
tsort [-dlq] [FILE]
FreeBSD options can be:
-d turn on debugging
-l search for and display the longest cycle.
-q Do not display informational messages about cycles.
GNU provides the following options only:
--help display help message and exit
--version display version information and exit
There are no options prescribed by POSIX.
Behavior
tsort reads its input (from the given FILE, or standard input if no input file is given or for a FILE of '-') as pairs of strings, separated by blanks, indicating a partial ordering. The output is a total ordering that corresponds to the given partial ordering.
In other words: for a directed acyclic graph (used as a dependency graph), tsort produces a listing of the
vertices so that for all edges 'a->b', 'a' comes before 'b' in the listing.
Examples
tsort lists the vertices of a directed acyclic graph in such an order that all ordering/direction relations are respected:
Call graph
tsort can help to rearrange functions in a source file so that as many as possible are defined before they are used (Interpret the following as: calls , and ; calls , and so on. The result is that should be defined first, second, etc.):
Library
The traditional ld (Unix linker) requires that its library inputs be sorted in topological order, since it processes files in a single pass. This applies both to static libraries () and dynamic libraries (), and in the case of static libraries preferably for the individual object files contained within.
BSD UNIX uses tsort as a common part of the typical ar & ranlib command invocations (from /usr/share/mk/bsd.lib.mk):
lib${LIB}.a: ${OBJS} ${STATICOBJS}
@${ECHO} building static ${LIB} library
@${AR} cq ${.TARGET} `lorder ${OBJS} ${STATICOBJS} | tsort -q` ${ARADD}
${RANLIB} ${.TARGET}
Here ("library order") is used to generate the inter-file dependency list by inspecting the symbol table.
Usage notes
Notice the interchangeability of white space separators so the following inputs are equivalent:
Pairs of identical items indicate presence of a vertex, but not ordering (so the following represents one vertex without edges):
a a
Strictly speaking there is no topological ordering of a graph that contains one or more cycles. However tsort prints a warning and GNU tsort prints the detected cycles to standard error (lines beginning with 'tsort:'):
$ tsort <<EOF
> a b
> b c
> c a
> EOF
UX: tsort: INFORM: cycle in data
tsort: a
tsort: b
tsort: c
a

The Madison Hotel Boardwalk Atlantic City is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States. It was built in 1929 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 1984.
The 14-story building opened as a luxury hotel at the beginning of the Great Depression in the United States. It went through bankruptcy in the 1960s and later became part of Sands Atlantic City.
In 2004, Sands invested $7 million to renovate and reconfigure the property into 126 suites. In 2006, both the Sands and the Madison Hotel were closed.
On May 25, 2013, the Madison Hotel was auctioned with a winning bid of $4 million by Eli Hadad, an owner of hotels in Florida and the Dominican Republic. However, the purchase was not completed and the property was again offered for sale. In November 2013, the hotel was purchased by Ratan Hotel Group for $2.5 million.
On January 25, 2014 it reopened as Baymont Inn & Suites Atlantic City Madison Hotel, managed by the Baymont Inn & Suites chain.

Curtis Kaazim Riley Jr. (born July 18, 1992) is an American football strong safety who is a free agent. He played college football at Fresno State. He previously played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Oakland Raiders, New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Arizona Cardinals, and Minnesota Vikings.
Professional career
Tennessee Titans
Riley went undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft. On May 4, 2015, the Tennessee Titans signed Riley to a three-year, $1.58 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $12,000.
2015
Throughout training camp, Riley competed for a roster spot as a backup cornerback and special teams player against Khalid Wooten, Marqueston Huff, Cody Riggs, Jemea Thomas, and Ri'Shard Anderson. On August 10, 2015, the Titans waived Riley after he injured his ankle while making an interception during practice. He reverted to injured reserve after clearing waivers. On November 3, 2015, the Titans fired head coach Ken Whisenhunt after they fell to a 1–6 record and promoted assistant head coach/tight ends coach Mike Mularkey to interim head coach for the remainder of the season.
2016
Riley entered training camp as a backup cornerback and competed for a roster spot against B. W. Webb, Valentino Blake, Kalan Reed, Bennett Okotcha, Cody Riggs, and Josh Aubrey. On September 2, 2016, the Titans officially waived Riley as part of their final roster cuts, but signed him to their practice squad the following day. On September 22, 2016, the Titans promoted Riley to their active roster.
On October 9, 2016, Riley made his professional regular season debut in the Titans' 30–17 victory at the Miami Dolphins in Week 3. Riley was inactive as a healthy scratch for eight of the next 11 games (Weeks 6–7, 10–11, and 14–17).
2017
Riley competed for a roster spot as a backup safety against Brynden Trawick, Da'Norris Searcy, and Denzel Johnson. Head coach Mike Mularkey named Riley the backup free safety to start the season, behind Kevin Byard.
Riley was inactive for the Titans' season-opening loss to the Oakland Raiders. On September 17, 2017, Riley made one solo tackle, broke up a pass, and made his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Blake Bortles in the second half of a 37–16 victory at the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 2. The interception helped set up the Titans on an eventual field goal scoring drive to close out the first half. In Week 4, he collected a season-high four solo tackles during a 57–14 loss at the Houston Texans. Riley was inactive for eight of the next nine games (Week 9–15). He finished the season with 12 combined tackles (eight solo), two pass deflections, and one interception in four games and zero starts.
New York Giants
On March 16, 2018, the New York Giants signed Riley to a one-year, $630,000 contract. Riley was reunited with Giants assistant defensive backs coach Deshea Townsend, who had previously held the same position with the Titans.
Riley started training camp as a cornerback and competed against Donte Deayon for a roster spot as the first-team nickelback, but was moved to safety after Darian Thompson suffered a hamstring injury. He competed to be the starting free safety against Thompson, Andrew Adams, Michael Thomas, and William Gay. Head coach Pat Shurmur named Riley the starting free safety to begin the regular season. He started alongside strong safety Landon Collins and cornerbacks Janoris Jenkins and Eli Apple.
He made his first career start in the Giants' season-opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars and recorded six combined tackles in their 20–15 loss. On October 7, 2018, Riley recorded three solo tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass by quarterback Cam Newton during a 33–31 loss at the Carolina Panthers in Week 5. On December 9 against the Washington Redskins, he scored his first NFL touchdown after intercepting a pass from Mark Sanchez.
Oakland Raiders
On March 22, 2019, Riley signed a one-year deal worth $810,000 with the Oakland Raiders.
Pittsburgh Steelers
On August 3, 2020, Riley signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was released on September 6, 2020, and re-signed to the practice squad.
Arizona Cardinals
On September 17, 2020, the Arizona Cardinals signed Riley to their active roster off of the Steelers' practice squad after Arizona's starting safety Jalen Thompson suffered an injury in Week 1 and was placed on injured reserve. He was released on October 6, 2020, and re-signed to the practice squad the next day. He was elevated to the active roster on October 10 for the team's week 5 game against the New York Jets, and reverted to the practice squad after the game.
Minnesota Vikings
On October 30, 2020, the Minnesota Vikings signed Riley to their active roster off the Cardinals' practice squad. Riley was waived on December 12, 2020, and re-signed to the practice squad three days later. His practice squad contract with the team expired after the season on January 11, 2021.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
On May 17, 2021, Riley signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On July 22, he was waived/injured and placed on injured reserve.

The Kaiserliche Generaldirektion der Eisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen or EL (English: General Directorate of the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine) were the first railways owned by the German Empire.
They emerged in 1871, after France had ceded the region of Alsace-Lorraine to the German Empire under the terms of the Peace Treaty of Frankfurt following the Franco-Prussian War. The railways of the private Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est (CF de l'Est; English: [French] Eastern Railway Company), with a total of trackage, were formally purchased from the French and then sold again to the German Empire. The purchase price of 260 million Goldmarks was counted as compensation for the war.
The General Directorate of the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine (Kaiserliche Generaldirektion der Eisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen) had its head office in Straßburg (now Strasbourg) and was subordinated directly to the Reich Chancellor. In 1878, however, it was re-subordinated to the newly created Imperial Ministry for the Management of Railways in Alsace-Lorraine in Berlin. The General Division managed six regional operating divisions, which had their headquarters in Mülhausen (now Mulhouse), Kolmar (Colmar), Straßburg I and II, Saargemünd (now Sarreguemines) and Metz. It was also responsible for a seventh region, with a headquarters in Luxemburg, which ran the operations of the Wilhelm Luxemburg Railway.
In the early days, railway vehicles were almost exclusively and forcibly taken from the German railways, because French troops had taken with them almost all rolling stock in the region during the retreat. The French side later built copies of German railway stock, mainly based on Prussian prototypes.
Railway operations were carried out, in principle, in accordance with the regulations of the Prussian state railways. Because the CF de l'Est were also the leaseholders of the Wilhelm Luxemburg Railway with a route length of , the Imperial Railways took over the running of the network. An long railway line from Colmar to Münster (French Munster), which belonged to the town of Münster, was also purchased.
In the succeeding years the network was expanded significantly. Shortly before the start of the First World War (1912) the Imperial Railway network in Alsace-Lorraine had a total length of , of which was narrow gauge (?). After the end of the war, these railways returned to France. Subsequently, the network of this region was managed independently again as the Administration des chemins de fer d'Alsace et de Lorraine until it merged into the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF) in 1938.
In Alsace and Moselle, many multi-track routes are still driven on the right, whereas in the rest of France they drive on the left.

The KNVB Amateur Cup () was the cup competition for amateur football clubs in the Netherlands. The winner qualified until 2016 for the amateur super cup match against the national Hoofdklasse champion.
The cup was contested by the winners of the district cups () in the six districts of the Royal Dutch Football Association: West 1, West 2, South 1, South 2, East and North. The six teams faced each other in a knock-out competition, starting in the quarter-finals. Two clubs received a bye, but they had to play an away game in the semi-finals.
The KNVB Amateur Cup was first contested in the 1980-81 season, replacing the KNVB Saturday Amateur Cup and KNVB Sunday Amateur Cup (''see Hoofdklasse#Background for more on Saturday and Sunday football in the Netherlands).
The structure of the cup competition has changed throughout the years. For a number of years, the clubs were placed in two pools of three teams each. Matches were played in two halves of 20 or 30 minutes each, with all group matches played on a single day. The final was held on another day, and was played in two halves of 45 minutes. Between 1996-97 and 2000–01, nine clubs took part, because the Royal Dutch Football Association then consisted of nine districts. Until 1997, the reserve teams of professional football clubs took part in the district cup competitions; two of them won the KNVB Amateur Cup: Ajax Reserves in 1983-84 and SC Heerenveen Reserves in 1990-91. From the 1997-98 season onwards, the reserve teams play in the KNVB Reserve Cup.
The KNVB decided, in consultation with the clubs, that the final round between the six district cup winners for the Amateur Cup came to an end after the 2015–16 season.

Graduated from the University of the Republic in 1988, he has the degree of Doctor of Medicine. In 2008 he obtained a bachelor's degree in neurology. In 2012 he obtained a master's degree in Health Business Management from the University of Montevideo and in 2018 a master's degree in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from the University of Barcelona. He also has a Diploma in Sleep Medicine from the Faculty of Medicine of Latin American Center for Human Economy (CLAEH).
Early life
Raised in San José de Mayo, he is the eldest son of two teachers; his father was chairman of the San José Department of Teaching Union. He started working at the age of thirteen mending shoes in his hometown.
Career
In the practice of medicine, he worked in different health centers, such as the Círculo Católico de Obreros del Uruguay, Central Hospital of the Armed Forces and Casa de Galicia. Between 2012 and 2018 he served as head of the Electroencephalography Service at Vilardebó Hospital, while between 2009 and 2019 as manager of Material Resources of the Uruguay Medical Union Assistance Center (CASMU).
Minister of Health
Salinas was appointed Minister of Public Health on December 16, 2019, as a member of a party that makes up the electoral alliance, Coalición Multicolor. He took office on March 1, in replacement of Jorge Basso.
Coronavirus pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic emerged within the first days of the administration. The first cases were reported on 13 March 2020 by the Ministry of Public Health. On March 14, public performances were canceled and some public places were closed. Local transmission was established with two non-imported cases reported on 15 March. The first patients showed mild symptoms of COVID-19.
On 7 April 2020, the ship Greg Mortimer, which holds up to 216 passengers, became stranded in Uruguayan waters, asking for help after people exhibited symptoms such as fever, which prompted authorities to ban them from disembarking. After the Uruguayan medical teams boarded the cruise ship to test passengers on 1 April, 81 people tested positive for COVID-19. Six people found seriously ill with coronavirus were evacuated and transferred to hospitals. A news report on 8 April stated that the ship had not yet received permission to dock, although Uruguayan authorities were arranging an evacuation flight to Australia and New Zealand. By that time 128 persons on the vessel had tested positive for COVID-19. Six had transferred to a hospital in Montevideo. Passengers from Europe and America who had positive tests would not be allowed to travel to their home countries until their subsequent tests indicated negative results. On the night of 10 April some passengers were evacuated in order to fly to Australia. On 18 April, a Filipino crewman died of the coronavirus.

River is a village and civil parish in Kent, England, situated between the historic town of Dover and the neighbouring village of Temple Ewell. The 2011 census recorded a population of 3,876 in the village. River is 1 mile south west of the A2 and 2 miles north of the A20, and a railway station at Kearsney provides direct access to London.
History
There are two churches in the village, the 11th-century Anglican parish church of St Peter & St Paul, and a Methodist church with a history dating back to 1834.
The oldest residential sections of River date from the 1800s or earlier. Later development possibly dates to the 1930s, as well as recent developments from the 1960s and 1970s.
Geography
River is situated in a steep wooded valley formed by the River Dour. At its north-west end the valley splits into the Dour Valley, in which Temple Ewell lies, and the Alkham Valley, which for much of the time is dry but which contains the Drellingore, a highly seasonal stream characteristic of chalk downland (another example being the nearby Nailbourne). The confluence of the Dour and Drellingore rivers is situated in Kearsney Abbey.
At the valley floor, River is on average about above sea level. Along the axis of the Dour, the land slopes gradually down towards the sea about distant. The common land areas above Kearsney Abbey provide a view of Dover and its castle, and much of the area consists of delicate chalk grassland.
Governance
River comes under the jurisdiction of Dover District Council and is in the Dover and Deal parliamentary constituency. River has had its own Parish Council since 1987. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Hougham Without and has a total population at the 2011 census of 4,564.
Economy
River once had a number of shops, but most have gradually closed; a small Co-op supermarket, as well as two other grocery stores exist in the town today. River retains its post office, as well as a pharmacy and a Chinese take-away.
The village has a park, Kearsney Abbey, and two other parks nearby.
Recreation and culture
There are two significant green areas, the River Recreation Ground (which is home to the River Bowling Club) and Kearsney Abbey. Despite its name, Kearsney Abbey was never a monastic estate but was the name given to a manor house, built by the Fector family in the early 19th century. The house fell into disrepair after World War II and was demolished around 1960. All that remains of the building today is the billiard room.
The nearby stadium of Crabble Athletic Ground is home to Dover Athletic F.C., and is situated at the Dover end of Lewisham Road. Crabble once had a cricket ground, the home of the now defunct Dover Cricket Club, which used to host First Class cricket.
The park of Russell Gardens is situated on the Alkham Valley Road beyond Kearsney Abbey.
In 2021 a number of painted paving slabs were erected in the old bus terminus which were created by local resident Vicky Thomas during the 2020 COVID lockdown.
The village has a primary school of about 400 pupils.
Mills
River owes its early existence to milling. The River Dour, which runs through the village and along which Lower Road is built, once supported several water-powered flour and paper mills. One of them, formerly known as Mannering's Mill but now known as Crabble Corn Mill (built in 1812), survives in working form. It now promotes itself as a visitor attraction and restaurant.
The site of the other major mill in River is disused, situated at the downstream end of Kearsney Abbey. It forms a habitat for water birds such as grey wagtails and kingfishers. Other mills existed further downstream, but all have been either demolished or converted for other industry or housing.

was a district located in the old province of Mutsu, Japan (now in current Aomori Prefecture). The district once had a land in southern Hokkaido but in 1878, the district dissolved by splitting up into 5 districts.
As the Tsugaru Domain, the area was considered a de facto province in its own right, and even today Japan Rail and other local railroad stations prefix Tsugaru- to their names instead of Mutsu- as in stations in the rest of Aomori Prefecture.
Description
1664 - Under Tokugawa Shogunate's orders, Tsugaru District's name was visible on the letter published by the shogunate against the Tsugaru Clan's Tsugaru Nobumasa (津軽信政). This order combined Hanawa, Hiraga, and Inaka Districts in the Tsugaru Region.

Sir Āpirana Turupa Ngata (3 July 1874 – 14 July 1950) was a prominent New Zealand statesman. He has often been described as the foremost Māori politician to have served in Parliament in the mid-20th century, and is also known for his work in promoting and protecting Māori culture and language. His legacy is one of the most prominent of any New Zealand leader in the 20th century, and is cemented with his depiction on the fifty dollar note.
Ngata practiced as a lawyer before entering politics in 1897, when he established the Young Māori Party alongside numerous alumni of Te Aute College, including future fellow cabinet minister Māui Pōmare. Here he challenged the traditional views of his people, advocating the abandonment of some traditional practices and customary healing in favour of science and Pākehā-style sanitation, which made him a controversial figure. In 1905, he was elected the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastern Maori, retaining this seat for nearly 40 years.
He served in government as Minister of Native Affairs from 1928 to 1934. In this he tried to accomplish as many reforms for Māori as possible, although he was forced to resign as minister in a widely publicised spending scandal. Nevertheless, he continued to serve as MP for Eastern Maori until he was ousted in 1943 by Rātana candidate (affiliated with Labour) Tiaki Omana, as Labour swept the Māori electorates. At the age of 69 he returned to his Ngāti Porou home 129 kilometres north of Gisborne, where he lived with his four sons and four daughters, and multiple grandchildren, until his death seven years later.
Early life
Ngata was born in Te Araroa (then called Kawakawa), a small coastal town about north of Gisborne, New Zealand. His iwi was Ngāti Porou. His father was Paratene Ngata, a tribal leader and expert in traditional lore, and his mother was Katerina Naki, the daughter of an itinerant Scot, Abel Enoch. Ngata was greatly influenced both by his father and by his great-uncle Ropata Wahawaha (who had led loyal kupapa Ngāti Porou forces against their Pai Mārire enemy (commonly known as Hauhau) in the East Cape War and later Te Kooti's escapees from the Chatham Islands). Ngata was raised in a Māori environment, speaking the Māori language, but his father also ensured that Ngata learnt about the Pākehā world, believing that this understanding would be of benefit to Ngāti Porou.
Ngata attended primary school in Waiomatatini before moving on to Te Aute College, where he received a Pākehā-style education. Ngata performed well, and his academic results were enough to win him a scholarship to Canterbury University College (now the University of Canterbury), where he studied political science and law. He gained a BA in politics in 1893, the first Māori to complete a degree at a New Zealand university, then gained an LL.B. at the University of Auckland in 1896 (the first New Zealander, Māori or Pākehā, to gain a double degree).
First marriage and children
In 1895, a year before finishing his second degree (law), Ngata married 16-year-old Arihia Kane Tamati who was also of the Ngāti Porou iwi. Ngata had previously been engaged to Arihia's elder sister, Te Rina, but she died. Āpirana and Arihia had fifteen children, eleven of whom survived to adulthood; six girls and five boys.
Shortly after Ngata's legal qualifications were recognised, he and his wife returned to Waiomatatini where they built a house, initially called 'Te Wharehou' and later known as 'The Bungalow'. Ngata quickly became prominent in the community, making a number of efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of Māori across the country. He also wrote extensively on the place of Māori culture in the modern age. At the same time, he gradually acquired a leadership role within Ngāti Porou, particularly in the area of land management and finance.
Political career
Ngata's first involvement with national politics came through his friendship with James Carroll, who was Minister of Native Affairs in the Liberal Party government. Ngata assisted Carroll in the preparation of two pieces of legislation, both of which were intended to increase the legal rights enjoyed by Māori. In the 1905 election, Ngata himself stood as the Liberal candidate for the Eastern Maori electorate, challenging the incumbent Wi Pere. He was elected to Parliament.
Early career
Ngata quickly distinguished himself in Parliament as a skilled orator. He worked closely with his friend Carroll, and also worked closely with Robert Stout. Ngata and Stout, members of the Native Land Commission, were often critical of the government's policies towards Māori, particularly those designed at encouraging the sale of Māori land. In 1909, Ngata assisted John Salmond in the drafting of the Native Land Act.
In late 1909, Ngata was appointed to Cabinet, holding a minor ministerial responsibility for Māori land councils. He retained this position until 1912, when the Liberal government was defeated. Ngata followed the Liberals into Opposition.
In the First World War, Ngata was highly active in gathering Māori recruits for military service, working closely with Reform Party MP, Maui Pomare. Ngata's own Ngāti Porou were particularly well represented among the volunteers. The Māori commitment to the war by some iwi, can be attributed to Ngata and Pomare and this created a certain amount of goodwill from Pākehā towards iwi who had loyally supported the country; this assisted Ngata's later attempts to resolve land grievances.
Although in Opposition, Ngata enjoyed relatively good relations with his counterparts across the House in the Reform Party. He had a particularly good relationship with Gordon Coates, who became Prime Minister in 1925 and later Princess Te Puea of Waikato. The establishment of several government bodies, such as the Māori Purposes Fund Control Board and the Board of Māori Ethnological Research, owed much to Ngata's involvement.
Māori interests
Ngata was also active in a huge variety of other endeavours. The most notable, perhaps, was his involvement in academic and literary circles – in this period, he published a number of works on significant Māori culture, with , a collection of Māori songs, being one of his better known works. Ngata was also heavily involved in the protection and advancement of Māori culture among Māori themselves, giving particular attention to promoting the haka, poi dancing, and traditional carving that had been begun by Te Puea. One aspect of his advocacy of Māori culture was the construction of many new traditional meeting houses throughout the country. Yet another of Ngata's interests was the promotion of Māori sport, which he fostered by encouraging intertribal competitions and tournaments. Finally, Ngata also promoted Māori issues within the Anglican Church in New Zealand, encouraging the creation of a Māori bishopric. In December 1928, Frederick Bennett, was consecrated as suffragan bishop to the Waiapu diocese with the title Bishop of Aotearoa. Ngata and Bishop Herbert Williams campaigned for the recognition of Māori language as a subject for study in the University of New Zealand, with the study of Māori becoming eligible for a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1928.
Throughout all this, Ngata also remained deeply involved in the affairs of his Ngāti Porou iwi, particularly as regards land development. He was instrumental in establishing the land incorporation scheme whereby unused Māori land with multiple owners was amalgamated under a farm manager—often Pākehā, who developed and ran the farm. In government he was able to arrange for the transfer of four blocks of farm land to Te Puea Herangi and her husband. He arranged grants and government loans to help her develop farms for Waikato. He fired the Pākehā farm manager and replaced him with Te Puea. He arranged a car for her so she could travel around her estates. In 1934, during the depression, the public, media and parliament became alarmed at the large sums of money being gifted to Te Puea and others. A royal commission was held and Ngata was found guilty of irregularities in expenditure and negligence in administration, but no major scandals were unearthed. His land projects up to 1934 had involved the expenditure of £500,000, most of which was recoverable. Ngata resigned in December 1934. Ngata fought for higher living standards for the Māori people, and was very active during an economic depression in New Zealand in the Thirties, developing large farms which provided jobs and helped to restore the dignity of many Māori.
Ngata was knighted as a Knight Bachelor in the 1927 King's Birthday Honours, only the third Māori (after Carroll and Pomare) to receive this honour.
Ministerial career
In the 1928 election, the United Party (a rebranding of the old Liberal Party, to which Ngata belonged) won an unexpected victory. Ngata was returned to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Native Affairs. He was ranked third within Cabinet, and occasionally served as acting Deputy Prime Minister. Ngata remained extremely diligent in his work, and was noted for his tirelessness. Much of his ministerial work related to land reforms, and the encouragement of Māori land development. Ngata continued to believe in the need to rejuvenate Māori society, and worked strongly towards this goal.
In 1929, Ngata's wife Arihia Ngata and his eldest son Mākarini died of dysentery. After Arihia's death, Ngata married Te Rīringi Tūhou in 1932.
In 1932 Ngata and his Department of Native Affairs came under increasing criticism from other politicians. Many believed that Ngata was pressing ahead too fast, and the large amount of activity that Ngata ordered had caused organizational difficulties within the department. An inquiry into Ngata's department was held, and it was discovered that one of Ngata's subordinates had falsified accounts. Ngata himself was severely criticised for disregarding official regulations which he had often felt were inhibiting progress. It was also alleged that Ngata had shown favouritism to Ngāti Porou and Waikato, especially Te Puea and her husband Rawiri Tumokai Katipa. Bob Semple, a leading Labour politician, said the Royal Commission investigation showed one of the worst specimens of abuse of political power, maladministration, misappropriation of public funds as well as a betrayal of trust. Ngata, while denying any personal wrongdoing, accepted responsibility for the actions of his department and was dismissed from his ministerial position.
Māori leaders, such as Te Puea, were angry at Ngata for discrediting and embarrassing Māori.
Later life and legacy
Although Ngata had resigned from Cabinet, he still remained in Parliament. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935. In the 1935 election, the Labour Party was triumphant – Ngata went into Opposition, although the new Labour government retained many of his land reform programs. Ngata remained in Parliament until the 1943 election, when he was finally defeated by a Labour-Rātana candidate, Tiaki Omana. He had been a member of parliament for almost 38 consecutive years, breaking the previous record of 32 years set by James Carroll and coming close to Maurice O'Rorke overall record of nearly 39 years. Both marks were later surpassed by Rex Mason.
Ngata stood again for his seat in the 1946 election, but was unsuccessful. He remained involved in politics despite leaving Parliament. He gave advice on Māori affairs to both Peter Fraser (a Labour Prime Minister) and Ernest Corbett (a National Minister of Māori Affairs), and arranged celebrations of the Treaty of Waitangi's centenary in 1940. In the Second World War, he once again helped gather Māori recruits. On 22 June 1950, he was appointed to Parliament's upper house, the Legislative Council, but was too ill by this time to take his seat.
In 1948, Ngata's second wife, Lady Te Rīringi, died, and he married Hēne Te Kira not long before his own death.
On 7 May 1948, Ngata received an honorary doctorate in literature (LittD) from the Victoria College. At the same ceremony, his youngest son Hēnare graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.
Ngata died in Waiomatatini on 14 July 1950, following a brief illness, and was buried beside his first wife Lady Arihia behind their home 'The Bungalow' in Waiomatatini. He is remembered for his great contributions to Māori culture and language. His image appears on New Zealand's $50 banknote.
Sir Āpirana and Lady Arihia Ngata guided the design of the St. Michael and All Angels' Chapel at Hukarere Girls College, and the chapel was consecrated on 1 November 1953.
Several schools have houses named after him, including Rangiora High School, Tauranga Boys' College, Rotorua Intermediate, Cashmere High School, Te Aute College (where Ngata went), Te Puke High School, Wainuiomata High School and Otumoetai Intermediate.
Ngata has inspired all sorts of politicians today, who follow his blend of progressive conservatism. As controversial as he was adulated, Ngata's legacy is still very complicated. While many have praised him for tireless work to promote the Māori language (especially in a white-based, right-wing political environment), others have criticised and even derided him for corruption, conservatism and not taking the views of all his iwi into account while making incredibly important decisions on his own.
Family legacy
On 19 October 2009, Āpirana Ngata's last surviving daughter, Mate Huatahi Kaiwai (born Ngata), died at her residence at Ruatoria, East Cape, New Zealand, aged 94. She was interred next to her late husband Kaura-Ki-Te-Pakanga Kaiwai and her son Tanara Kaiwai at Pukearoha Urupa. In the 2004 New Year Honours she had been made a Companion of the Queen's Service Order (QSO) for community service.
Ngata's youngest son, Sir Hēnare Ngata, died on 11 December 2011 aged 93. He was Māori vice-president of the National Party from 1967 to 1969 and stood as the National Party candidate for Eastern Māori in 1969.
Ngata's grandson Hōri Mahue Ngata wrote a widely used Māori-English dictionary.

The Southsea Railway was a branch of the Portsmouth Direct Line, located on Portsea Island, Hampshire in the United Kingdom. The railway was opened on 1 July 1885 and closed on 6 August 1914.
History
In 1879, South Parade Pier was opened by Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar in Southsea, a fashionable Victorian seaside resort in southern Portsmouth.
South Parade Pier, measuring in length, began operating a passenger steamer service across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. This service gave rise to the idea of linking Southsea and its pier to Portsmouth's railway line, bypassing the busy town of Portsmouth and its crowded harbour. A similar scheme had already been operating between Clarence Pier and Portsmouth Town railway station since 1861.
The Southsea Railway Company was founded by Edwin Galt, who had been the mayor of Portsmouth from 1868 to 1869. Work on the new line began in March 1884, with Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar cutting the first sod.
The first and original terminus station of the Southsea Railway was named Southsea and was built in a grand Queen Anne style. The station was located to the north of Granada Road, Southsea, and south of the southern side of St. Simon's Church, in St. Ronan's Road, Southsea. The station and its tracks were orientated diagonally north-east in parallel with the southern side of St. Ronan's Road, and had three long platforms under a glass paned roof.
Southsea station, along with the Southsea Railway and Fratton railway station were jointly opened on 1 July 1885 by Lady Ada Mary Willis (née Neeld), wife of General Sir George Willis, the Lieutenant Governor of Portsmouth. The Southsea Railway was built to serve the fashionable Victorian seaside resort of Southsea, and at its northern end, the Southsea Railway connected to the Portsmouth Direct Line at Fratton railway station.
The Southsea Railway line was an uninterrupted 1.25 miles (2 km) long, using cuttings excavated to pass under Old Bridge Road and Albert Road, then under earth-bank road bridges built at Devonshire Avenue and Goldsmith Avenue. At the railway lines northern end, after passing underneath the Goldsmith Avenue road bridge, it connected to a dedicated island platform at Fratton railway station - itself purposely built as an interchange station for the Southsea Railway and Portsmouth Direct Line.
Fratton Station was also opened on the same day that the Southsea Railway was. An earlier alternative location for the Southsea Railway interchange station was originally planned at the newly built Station Road in Copnor, Portsmouth, but was not constructed, instead built at Fratton. Ironically, Copnor's Station Road still exists today, near to Copnor Bridge.
By the twentieth century, the Southsea Railway was experiencing competition with Portsmouth Corporation Transport electric trams and trolleybuses. Conventional steam trains on the line were replaced in 1903 with long steam railcars. The steam-powered railcars had small wheels and allegedly gave passengers a bumpy ride.
In 1904, the original 1885 Southsea station building was leased out to a motor engineer business as a cost-cutting measure, the Southsea Railway terminus then moved south to a much smaller single wooden platform station named East Southsea, built directly on Granada Road itself. Two unstaffed station halts were added in 1904 at Jessie Road and Albert Road
Sadly, on 19 July 1904, South Parade Pier was destroyed by fire, before being rebuilt and reopening on 12 August 1908.
On 4 July 1905, Fratton railway station's name was changed to Fratton & Southsea.
The First World War, closure and fate
By 1914, the threat of the First World War loomed. The final nail in the Southsea Railway's coffin was a government directive issued shortly after the declaration of war to the effect that railways unable to support themselves would cease operations at the earliest opportunity; and, as the line clearly fell into this category, the last train ran on 6 August 1914. The original 1885 Southsea station at Granada Road was used as a munitions store during the war, while the rail line itself served as an additional overflow siding from Fratton railway station's goods yard.
After the war, the Southsea Railway and its stations lay abandoned. Partial removal of the line was sanctioned by Section 55 of the Southern Railway Act 1923. The 1885 Southsea station at Granada Road was converted into a road vehicle garage business, until it was demolished in the 1970s and later replaced with a residential cul de sac called Chewter Close which was named after former 1995 Portsmouth mayor, Malcolm Chewter.
Legacy
After the demise of the Southsea Railway, Fratton & Southsea station reverted to its original Fratton name on 1 December 1921.
The Southsea station name was later transferred to Portsmouth's main Portsmouth Town railway station in 1925 creating the present-day Portsmouth & Southsea railway station name. Portsmouth was elevated to city status a year later in 1926.
Southsea Railway route today
After its closure, the route of the Southsea Railway line was mostly redeveloped for housing, although its distinctive curved route can still be traced on a modern street map of present-day Portsmouth, and compared with period maps of the early twentieth century.
The site of Southsea's terminus station is now occupied by a modern residential cul de sac named Chewter Close, just to the north of Granada Road in Southsea. The original 1885 terminus station building was located at the northern end of today's Chewter Close until its demolition in the 1970s. A mural commemorating the station was unveiled on the northernmost wall in Chewter Close on 26 August 2011, although this wall was not part of the original station and was built as a boundary wall between new houses in Parkstone Avenue and the garage business which continued to use the station building until it's demolition in the 1970s. The smaller, later East Southsea station site is now occupied by modern houses close to the road junction of Chewter Close and Granada Road.
Immediately to the north of Chewter Close, the Southsea Railway line followed the route of today's Parkstone Avenue, a mid-twentieth century development of semi-detached houses that covered the southern end of the line. To the north of Parkstone Avenue, the railway route passed through a bridge cutting under the eponymously named Old Bridge Road.
The route of the former Southsea Railway continued northwards in a narrow cutting between St. Ronan's Road and Craneswater Avenue, now filled and occupied by housing. Further to the north, the line ran alongside the eastern side of Craneswater School and passed through the Albert Road bridge cutting (since demolished and filled in). The route is now covered by a small school car park, games courts and turfed playing fields, this land previously had an Odeon ('Salon' from 1977) cinema built on it in 1937 before closure and demolition in 1985.
Through the Albert Road bridge cutting, the line passed under what is now 253 Albert Road, a dry-cleaners store. Beside this, at 251 Albert Road, the railway passed alongside a building once called the Gaiety Cinema, which has since been converted into a modern-day Co-op supermarket. The shape of the Co-op building's east side wall still follows the same angle as the former railway line route.
Following the route north from Albert Road, there is now Festing Mews, a collection of lockup garages built over the Southsea Railway line route. Continuing northwards, the route passed through what is now Pepys Close, a row of twentieth century bungalows.
North of Pepys Close, a brick wall now blocks the route northwards into a wide present-day back alleyway that passes between the backs of terraced houses in Bath Road and St. Augustine Road. The Southsea Railway line once passed through this alleyway and emerged at today's expanded Devonshire Avenue, the former location of Jessie Road Bridge Halt railway station. A road bridge was formerly built above this station, and connected Jessie Road in the west to Devonshire Avenue in the east. A turfed island in the centre of the present day Devonshire Avenue marks the location of the eastern half end of the demolished bridge.
North of Devonshire Avenue, the Southsea Railway route began its northwest arc to link with Fratton railway station. The arc originally followed directly behind the back of terraced houses in Heidelberg Road, and then to the north of house fronts in Francis Avenue. The original railway route is now covered by the extended Fernhurst Road and the addition of Chestnut Avenue. The houses in these newer roads are of a later style to those found in Heidelberg Road and Francis Avenue.
From the north side of Francis Avenue, the Southsea Railway line then travelled beneath an earth-bank road bridge built at an angle over the top of Goldsmith Avenue and down into Fratton railway station. The bridge, since demolished, once occupied land on Goldsmith Avenue which presently has a large modern Lidl supermarket on it. The supermarket replaced an earlier Danepak Bacon building, built after the bridge and Southsea Railway route were demolished.
North of the Goldsmith Avenue bridge, the Southsea Railway route once terminated at its own dedicated covered platform island at Fratton railway station, south of the main station buildings and platforms. The island was built just to the east of the main Fratton station overhead footbridge, which previously had a flight of stairs leading down to the Southsea Railway's island platforms. This island at Fratton station was demolished after the Southsea Railway line closed, a modern train washing facility now occupies the site.
Alternative stations
Southsea is now served by stations at Fratton, Portsmouth & Southsea, and Portsmouth Harbour (also called The Hard), with regular trains to London Waterloo and coastway services.

Southsea Railway expansion
According to a 18 June 2016 article by Bob Hind of Portsmouth's The News newspaper, plans for an expansion to the Southsea Railway network were once considered, but were ultimately never built.
The expansion plan would have created a junction at Goldsmith Avenue for trains from either Southsea, Fratton or Portsmouth to travel along the northern side of Goldsmith Avenue to the road junction of Milton Road, following the exact former Portsmouth & Arundel Canal route through Milton, to the disused lock gates at Locksway Road beside Langstone Harbour.
A new bridge across Langstone Harbour would have linked Portsea Island directly to Hayling Island by rail, and connect to the Hayling Island branch line. This, if ever created would have created a large railway loop in south east Hampshire, as the Hayling Island branch line continued north to Havant railway station on the mainland, which in turn was connected to the Portsmouth Direct Line railway.
As noted by the newspaper article, this plan might have prevented the closure of the Hayling Island branch line on 2 November 1963. But as the Southsea Railway itself closed before this date in 1914, the alleged expansion plan was never seriously considered.

Rev. Jesse Elmer Holmes (1857–1921) was a prominent minister and community leader in Mississippi during the late 19th century and early 20th century.
Biography
Jesse Elmer Holmes was born in October 1857 in Yazoo County, Mississippi, as the youngest child of Jesse and Delia (Meyers) Holmes. He was educated in local schools. Like his father, the younger Holmes was a farmer. He was also a pastor with the Methodist Episcopal Church, beginning his career in the Yazoo City area.. A conservative, he was well-respected as both a civic and religious leader by whites as well as blacks.
Sometime during the middle of the first decade of the 20th century, Rev. Holmes relocated to the Mississippi Gulf Coast with his family and at various times lived in Ocean Springs, Bay Saint Louis, and Gulfport. He was a much sought after public speaker who would appear at a wide variety of events including fundraisers, blood drives, community forums, and graduations.
In 1917, as the United States was on the verge of entering World War I, reports were appearing on the Associated Press that questioned African American loyalty to the flag. As a way to reassure the larger community, Rev. Holmes along with Rev. H. H. Lowe, pastor of 1st Baptist Church and G. W. Brown, principal of the black public school, spoke at a large assembly at the county court house in Bay Saint Louis, which culminated in a resolution declaring that the African American citizens of the community were loyal to the federal government.
Later that year, Rev. Holmes was elected chairman of the Colored Red Cross chapter in Bay Saint Louis. His wife, Susie, served on the executive committee.
In 1919, Rev. Holmes was assigned to St. Mark M. E. Church in Gulfport, where he would serve for the remainder of his life.
In the beginning of 1921, when a white man only identified as Judge Mayo (possibly Martin A. Mayo, a once prominent attorney from Chicago) spoke to a group of black leaders in Gulfport, it caused quite a stir within the larger community. During his speech Mayo was advocating among other things that black people should fight for “social equality.” In response to an article published about the meeting in the Biloxi Daily Herald, Rev. Holmes (who attended the meeting in question) wrote that Mayo “did touch along the lines of colored people riding in public conveyances and dining in some hotels beyond the Mason & Dixon line; but that was no news to us for many of us who are here in Gulfport today have experienced it and we didn't like it!”
In the same letter Rev. Holmes went on to argue that the primary reason that blacks were leaving the South (which would be later described as the Great Migration) was driven more by a desire to escape violence perpetrated on them by whites, than to escape segregation. He wrote:
Just a few weeks later, Rev. Holmes died at his home in Gulfport on Friday, 22 April 1921. In his obituary, which appeared in multiple area newspapers, it said about him, “He was a builder in the very essence of the word, and his death removes from every day life one of the colored leaders of the State who stood for the industrial uplift and moral development of the colored people.”
His funeral was officiated by Bishop Robert E. Jones, who had recently become one of the first two African Americans appointed to that position in the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was assisted by many pastors from around Mississippi and the Gulf Coast region. The funeral was well attended.
Personal life
Mr. Holmes married Miss Susie E. Holmes on 21 May 1882 in Yazoo County, Mississippi. This union produced six children including a child, who died in infancy.

Jocelyn Rickards (29 July 19247 July 2005) was an Australian artist and costume designer.
During the 1940s to 1950s Rickards was one of the Merioola Group of artists. The review of her works in a 1948 exhibition by Paul Haefliger was the source of the coined phrase "The Charm School" to describe these Sydney artists.
In 1966 Rickards won a BAFTA Film Award for the film Mademoiselle.
In 1967 she was nominated at the 39th Academy Awards in the category of Best Costumes-Black and White for her work on the film Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment.
Her autobiography The Painted Banquet: My Life and Loves, was published in 1987 by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and was praised thus by Graham Greene (a former lover of hers): "An outstanding capacity for friendship - rare in the jealous world of art and letters to which she belongs - makes Jocelyn Rickard's autobiography unusually appealing".

IDEDOS is a ROM-based disk operating system written in 6502/65816 assembly language for the Commodore 64, 128 and SuperCPU. Its main purpose is to control ATA(PI) devices connected to an IDE64 cartridge and present them like normal Commodore drives. Additionally it supports networked drives (PCLink) and has a built-in machine code monitor and file manager.
Architecture
The C64 KERNAL uses a vector table at page 3 to allow redirection of common kernal file handling and basic functions. This feature is used by IDEDOS to hook into the C64 kernal.
The operating system itself is divided into four pages of 16 KiB which are mapped in when required. The mapping is temporarily switched off while interrupts are running for increased compatibility, however this causes a ≈40 μs latency.
Additional RAM for buffers and internal data are also mapped in from either the IDE64 cartridge (28 KiB) or the additional RAM of the SuperCPU is used. The standard kernal memory locations at page zero and page two are handled in a kernal-compatible way; temporarily used memory is restored after the routines are finished.
Beyond the kernal table IDEDOS has two new calls for bulk data handling (read/write) which allows much faster data transfer rates than the character-based I/O.
The native file system is non-CBM style at the low level to allow partitions greater than 16 MiB. High-level features like the 16-character filenames or filetypes are retained. Due to complexity and memory requirements, the filesystem creation and consistency check is not part of the operating system, unlike CBM DOS or CMD DOS.
Additional filesystems like ISO 9660 or FAT are abstracted internally and mostly use the same routines for handling, thereby little difference is noticeable to user programs, except if some features are not fully implemented.
The device handling is done by additional device numbers assigned to the new devices. The device numbers for IDEDOS devices are configurable and is normally in the range of 10–14. Over the years many programs assumed that there is only device 8 and do not allow selecting anything else; this can be worked around by temporary changing the used IDEDOS device number to 8.
For standard devices, the original kernal routines are used, while IDEDOS devices use custom routines which closely imitate the results and behavior of kernal calls for floppy devices. Kernal calls not going through the vector table (most notably IEC bus-specific calls) present an incompatibility with those programs using them.
Special features (like CD-ROM audio handling) are implemented by new channel 15 commands, while features not found on floppy drives follow the CMD style commands to allow programs to easily support a wider range of devices.
Unlike intelligent external devices which have a separate processor (like 1541 with CBMDOS), IDEDOS runs on the host computer, thereby all disk routines block until finished. This rules out the use of "IRQ loaders" which are commonly used to speed up operation of serial bus peripherals.
Interrupts are generally allowed while IDEDOS is running (they are disabled on rare time-critical operations), however the system was written to be non-reentrant, just like the original kernal.
Short history
In 1996 IDEDOS was born, as there was a need for a system to run the IDE64 1.1 card. It was created by Josef Souček (main code) and Tomáš Přibyl (File manager, Final cartridge monitor adaptation). Additional code came by Jan Vorlíček (BASIC extension), Jan Hlaváček (Duart PCLink).
In 2000 Kajtár Zsolt added CDROM support, new setup code and a lot of fixes. Due to limitations of the design the development of a completely rewritten version (0.90) was started by Kajtár Zsolt, which was not ready for general use before 2005. Meanwhile, the old version reached 0.898b in June 2004.
In 2009 the 64 KiB limit for the system started to get tight, and the IDEDOS 0.91 beta was started to refactor the code to gain more space and internal flexibility.
IDEDOS 0.898b
This was the last version of the old IDEDOS series.

The Royal Swordsmen () is a Chinese wuxia television series directed by Deng Yancheng and Wei Liyuan, starring Roger Kwok, Li Yapeng, Wallace Huo, Michelle Ye, Damian Lau, Tammy Chen, Gao Yuanyuan and Eva Huang. It was first shown on Shenzhen Media Group's Drama Channel on 30 January 2005.
Plot
The series is set in China during the Ming dynasty. Zhu Wushi, the Emperor's uncle, had received an order from the previous emperor to establish a secret service to protect the monarchy. One of the most formidable martial artists in the jianghu himself, Zhu Wushi has recruited four elite agents who are known by their code names: Heaven Number One, Mysterious Number One, Earth Number One, and Yellow Number One.
Heaven Number One is the calm and cool-headed Duan Tianya, who was raised as Zhu Wushi's godson and sent to Japan to learn ninjutsu from the Iga School. While in Japan, he had a romantic relationship with Yukihime, the elder daughter of Yagyū Tajima-no-Kami, the patriarch of the influential Yagyū clan. He also meets Nemuri Kyōshirō and learns kenjutsu from him. However, he becomes an enemy of the Yagyū clan after taking revenge against Yukihime's brother, who had murdered Nemuri Kyōshirō. Torn between her family and her lover, Yukihime ultimately sacrificed herself to prevent her father from killing Duan Tianya in a duel. Years later, Duan Tianya encounters Yukihime's sister and starts a relationship with her, but this brings him into conflict with the Yagyū clan again.
Mysterious Number One is the beautiful and intelligent Shangguan Haitang, who is well-versed in various skills and arts, including medicine and astronomy. Like Duan Tianya, she was also raised by Zhu Wushi as his goddaughter and trained by him in martial arts. She is in charge of an organisation made up of experts who are considered "Number Ones" in their respective trades, fields and professions. Through the organisation, she helps her godfather gather intelligence and scout for talents to join the secret service.
Earth Number One is the cold and aloof Guihai Yidao, whose skill in using the dao is unparalleled. He desires to avenge his murdered father and sees it as his purpose in life. In his quest for vengeance, he masters a powerful but highly perverse skill, and finds himself falling under its evil influence — to the point where he loses control of himself and starts to indiscriminately kill anyone who tries to stop him. He has also been secretly in love with Shangguan Haitang for many years but does not have the courage to confess his feelings to her.
Yellow Number One is the streetwise Cheng Shifei, who used to be a gambler, thief and confidence trickster. By coincidence, he encounters a dying Gu Santong, Zhu Wushi's love rival, who had lost to Zhu Wushi in a duel and has been imprisoned for many years. Before his death, Gu Santong transfers to Cheng Shifei all his inner energy and knowledge about martial arts, including a skill that allows him to temporarily turn his body into impenetrable metal, in the hope that Cheng Shifei can help him fulfil his wish of defeating Zhu Wushi. Cheng Shifei also incidentally meets the Emperor's sister, Princess Yunluo, and starts a romance with her and marries her eventually.
The secret service is in an ongoing political rivalry with the Eastern Depot, another imperial spy agency led by the eunuch Cao Zhengchun. The Emperor knows that Zhu Wushi and Cao Zhengchun are equally influential in politics, so he has been pitting them against each other in order to prevent either side from gaining too much power. The four agents help Zhu Wushi counter Cao Zhengchun's machinations on one hand, and perform their duties to the monarchy by protecting the Emperor from domestic and foreign threats on the other hand.
Zhu Wushi ultimately overcomes and eliminates Cao Zhengchun and becomes the single, most influential figure in the imperial court. At this point, he finally reveals his true colours. All these years, he has been secretly plotting an elaborate scheme to usurp the throne from the Emperor and he is now in the best position to do so; the four agents are merely pawns in his quest for power. In the end, the three surviving agents combine forces to defeat their treacherous master and save the Emperor.

No P. or D. is the debut studio album by German indie electronic band Ms. John Soda. It was released on 7 October 2002 by Morr Music.
Reception
Pitchfork critic Eric Carr highlighted the "serene vocals" and "rich, deep melodies" present throughout No P. or D., describing the album as a "fantastically accessible" record that "can be enjoyed with as much or as little of the brain as desired." Tiny Mix Tapes reviewer Wolfman wrote that he "couldn't help but feel a deep sense of inner peace" while listening to the album. Jaime Vázquez of AllMusic cited Ms. John Soda's ability to create "mood" as their "greatest strength", adding: "They make recordings that can be left on as background, but the arrangements hold up to scrutiny and reveal new subtleties with each listen." In a less enthusiastic review, Stylus Magazines Kareem Estefan was critical of the band's "cautious approach" and deemed the album "good, but inessential." At the end of 2003, No P. or D. was listed by Pitchfork as the year's 45th best album.

The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature is a multi-volume English language encyclopedia of Indian literature published by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. The idea for the project emerged in the mid-1970s, and three volumes were planned to cover all Indian literature, including that in native vernaculars. The scope of the project expanded as several editors-in-chief succeeded one another; six volumes were published between 1987 and 1993. The work received a positive reception, though a number of critics noted occasional inaccuracies in entries regarding a few of the subjects surveyed in what was otherwise hailed as a landmark in Indian scholarship.
History
At the 1975 annual meeting of the General Council of the Sahitya Akademi, E.M.J. Venniyoor and K.M. George proposed that the Akademi should plan and publish an encyclopaedia of Indian literature. The proposal was approved and the Executive Board set up a committee to examine the proposal, consisting of Suniti Kumar Chatterji as president, K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar as vice-president, and K.M. George, V. Y. Kantak, Amrit Rai and Vasant Bapat. The encyclopaedia was intended to be a single source of information about all significant Indian literary movements, writers and works in Indian history. It was envisaged that 12,000 entries would be necessary to cover this and that the finished work would be published in two volumes, each of approximately 1,000 pages. The topics and writers to be covered were to be determined by consultation with an advisory board. The committee asked K.M. George to be editor-in-chief; his role would be supervising the overall planning for, and execution of, the project. An editorial unit was set up at Trivandrum, Kerala. The editors estimated that the encyclopaedia would take five years to complete. The entire Executive Board of the Akademi, which consisted of representatives of all the languages it recognised, was to act as the editorial board, and a small steering committee was also to be established. Once these recommendations were approved, the project was launched.
While the compilation of lists of topics was in progress, dissatisfaction with the General Council emerged, and the location of the encyclopaedia unit at Trivandrum was questioned. To resolve the issues, a special meeting of the Executive Board was convened in 1976 to re-examine the project, and the board decided to relocate the encyclopaedia unit to Delhi. George resigned as editor-in chief after this move and Sitanshu Yashaschandra was appointed to replace him in 1977. Yashaschandra wanted an encyclopaedia with a broader coverage and a length over 3,000 pages, in three volumes. In 1978, the Executive Board discontinued its editorial function, and set up a steering committee consisting of Umashankar Joshi as president, Vinayaka Krishna Gokak as vice-president, with K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar, V. Y. Kantak, Vasant Bapat and Vidya Niwas Misra. Iyengar felt that the Encyclopaedia was "the most ambitious project" undertaken by the Akademi and that it might take years to complete. Yasaschandra was more optimistic, being certain that all three volumes could be published by 1982. By the time he withdrew from the project and the Akademi in 1982 the first volume had yet to be published. Amaresh Datta joined the project as the new editor-in-chief in 1984. Members of the editorial staff were recruited on an ad hoc basis for specific languages or zones and the work was expedited. The encyclopaedia as published ran to six volumes, and over five thousand demi-quarto-sized pages.
Publication
The first volume in the series was published in 1987, under the auspices of the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. In his editorial, Datta outlined the ambitions of the project, stating that it was designed to provide comprehensive coverage, with the matter arranged according to theme or author in alphabetical order, of how literature developed, from its Vedic/Sanskrit origins down to contemporary works in English by Indian authors. It would range over the literary heritage of each of India's 22 major languages, 25 if one regards Pali, Prakrit and Apabhramsa as distinct categories.
Datta also edited volumes 2 and 3, published in 1988 and 1989 respectively. He retired from the Akademi on reaching seventy in 1990. Mohan Lal succeeded him as the editor-in-chief and it was under his direction that the fourth and fifth volumes, respectively published in 1991 and 1992, came out. After Lal's death in an accident, the sixth and final volume, edited by Param Abichandani and K. C. Dutt, was published in 1994. K. Ayyappa Paniker was appointed editor-in-chief of revisions.
Reception
The first volume, published in 1987, was widely acclaimed. The Hindu newspaper, in its 21 July edition, greeted the first book by praising it for exemplary editorial expertise and massive, wide-ranging scholarship. The Hindustan Times, on 25 October, hailed the encyclopedia as a landmark for reference books on Indian culture. The Times of India, on 10 April 1988, considered the volume a first step in advancing towards a more extensive overview of Indian literature, and expressed hope that realizing such an end would eventually lead to academic courses and the issuing of a library of Indian masterpieces and a fresh wave of new critical studies. The Indian Book Industry, commended the volume in July 1987, "Lovers of Indian literature, both at home and abroad, owe a deep debt of gratitude to the Sahitya Akademi for bringing out this Encyclopaedia, a work of pioneering nature indeed".
The (reviewer) of The Statesman, published on 2 July 1988, thought otherwise:
In 1990, Vinayak Purohit of the Indian Institute of Social Research, Bombay, appealed to Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh "to stop the publication of further volumes of this shameful Encyclopaedia"; he cited numerous instances of error of fact, repetition, balance, and other lapses. He wrote to the new editor-in-chief Mohan Lal: "Please do not work at the futile break-neck pace of one volume per year. Encyclopaedias are never produced with such bureaucratic targets."
Defamation suit
Ujjalkumar Majumdar's article on Bengali poet Shakti Chatterjee in the Encyclopaedia angered Chatterjee, and he filed a defamation suit against the Akademi. The Indian Post subsequently headlined a seven column article: "A Poet Fights for his Reputation" and went on to report "Bengal's most popular poet, Sakti Chattopadhyay, smarting under the inference in the Sahitya Akademi's Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature that his work has been influenced by his alcoholic excesses and sexual escapades, has in an unprecedented move sued the Akademi". The Illustrated Weekly of India titled its article on the controvosy "The Angry Muse" and reported "Shakti Chattolpadhyay is angry and hurt. The celebrated Bengali poet is livid that the Sahitya Akademi, the nation's highest literary body, has cast aspersions on his character...". The Telegraph wrote of "A controversial critique and a raging poet". The Sunday Mail reported "A poet defends his habits". After a year, the controversy died down and the matter was eventually settled in 1989.
