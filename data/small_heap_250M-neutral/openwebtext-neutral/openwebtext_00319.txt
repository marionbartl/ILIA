Sound. We don't pay enough attention to it.
We all have our favourite evocative smells – lemon verbena, petrichor, Atlantic cliff gorse on a summer afternoon… I think I can identify at least half a dozen Cornish sea fish by their smell alone.
But favourite sounds? That takes more thought. Close to the top of my list would be the sound of crab plovers – the lilting contact calls they make – that grow, then fade, as they migrate along the Indian Ocean coast on clear nights; the sound of torrential rain drumming on taught canvas; the laughing, chattering call of a chough…
Sound has the ability to enthral. I remember my delight when, as a teenager, I was first introduced to the sound of a limpet feeding, by natural historian and mentor, Roger Burrows. It was low tide, at dusk, on a beach in South Cornwall. When I lowered my ear next to a foraging limpet, I could hear, quite clearly, the tiny scraping sound that the limpet's radula made as it rasped back and forwards at the film of algae. Try it, I guarantee it will bring a smile.
All too often though, natural sounds drift pass us, as we are too plugged in to let them in. In an urban environment the ambient noise level can be so high that only the most cacophonous and shrill force their way through.
Too often, in wildlife films, we approach the sound ‘picture' in an ‘urban' style – imagining that the film viewing is against background noise. In which case, we can dispense with the subtleties as we think they'll never be heard. Besides, there is generally plenty of commentary or music to fill the spaces. As filmmakers though, those spaces should be what we glory in. They aren't awkward silences – they are our opportunity for aural transport – to immerse the audience in the film's location.
As part of the sound ‘picture' in a film, we use atmosphere tracks – they are the background sounds, rich or sparse, from the film's location. They can be very specific. An East African dawn chorus sounds very different to one from South Africa. Even within a country there will be huge differences – a recording from Tsavo, is very different to one from Amboseli – the bird and antelope species are different – and so are the amphibians. There are seasonal differences, ‘time of day' differences, sometimes even the humidity makes a difference.
Track 1: Tsavo, the morning after the first heavy rainfall in almost a year:
Track 2: Tsavo, the same place, but twelve hours later:
Should it matter if we aren't true to the location with the sound we use? In wildlife films, sound is not recorded at the same time as picture. Despite the use of ‘shotgun' microphones and parabolic reflectors, there is no sound-recording equivalent to a telephoto zoom lens. Camera noise and wind combine to make synchronous sound recording impossible. Some would argue that as sound is not shot ‘sync' then it is all artifice and why should it matter if we substitute the sound of one place for another? – or occasionally one species for another?
I suspect that even if people don't know, then they instinctively feel what is right – an appreciation for sound is hard-wired in us. It resides in our genes. Few of us now have to worry about walking into an elephant or lion if we go out at night – but if you do, and your life depends on it, it is remarkable how that ability to really listen and discriminate natural sounds quickly returns. If you live in the bush, you need to know the sounds that will help you survive – the chirring alarm calls of ox-peckers alerting a buffalo to your presence, the calls that birds or squirrels make when mobbing a snake, the alarm calls of vervet monkeys on spotting a big cat…
If an audience feels a faint unease at a film's sound, then they rise closer to the surface of disbelief. The suspension of disbelief is essential to the success of the film-experience – as soon as an audience starts thinking about the filming process or the crew behind it, or what is outside the frame, then they disengage from the story, and the bubble of connectivity that they reside in with the filmmaker bursts. It can be impossible to re-establish.
Before Pixar's animated movie ‘Ratatouille' went into production the animators spent time in restaurant kitchens – not in Los Angeles, but in Paris. The aim was that the experience should help what they created feel authentic.
I think the same applies to wildlife films. If you use sound recorded on location at the right time of day, then it feels more authentic. It happens less often than you'd imagine – a dedicated sound recordist is the first to be dropped from a filming trip. The financial savings might be translated into more ‘camera-days', or visual effects – there are always areas of the budget that need boosting. The result is that the sound , even if recorded on location, is rarely as good. Many films rely solely on ‘library' sound but, just as when we use pictures from a library, if we rely too much on archive sound then, however good it is, subconsciously, we begin to feel we've experienced it before. It nibbles away at our suspension of disbelief. Films become more homogenous, sound is less appreciated and it assumes less importance.
Specialist sound studios, like ‘Wounded Buffalo', address this by constantly adding to their library, and recording on location, so the sound that results is fresh, engaging and transporting.
Sound can be as difficult to record as the images – recently the wildlife sound recordist on our team, Norbert Rottcher, spent days trying to get the sound of a new-born elephant calf squealing. It only happened once or twice a day, when a herd-member inadvertently stepped on the infant. Even if Norbert was lucky enough to be able to follow the herd, and be with the baby when it happened (hard in thick bush), the timing of a squeal was impossible to predict. They had to be recording continuously, estimate the audio-level it might be, and then be constantly aware of sounds that might obscure it.Elephants have an extraordinary repertoire – from trumpets and bird-like chirps, to infrasound rumbles – you only have to go to ‘Elephant Voices' http://www.elephantvoices.org to hear what they are capable of – such a collection reflects decades of work.
For us, it will be exciting to convey, in the cinema, the real range of elephant sounds. Up close, the deep rumbles are felt as much as they are heard. They create a frisson – they come at you through the soles of your feet, and move your whole being. Elephants have an extraordinary ability to communicate via infrasound, but most of their communications also have an audible component.
Television struggles to convey a full ‘sound picture' but it is where cinema excels – for low frequencies need large speakers to propagate them effectively.
Traditionally, many ‘spot' sounds for films are made in the ‘foley' booth, by a foley artist – wildlife films are no exception. A foley booth is a child's playground of sand boxes, buckets of water, blocks of wood, pebbles, coconut shells – anything to make the incidental sounds that are needed. All foley artists have their favourite methods, but a convention has arisen where the flap of a bird wing, or an elephant ear is depicted by the sound of an umbrella being rapidly opened and closed. A real elephant ear flap is much heavier, and scratchier, but it takes time to record – and, to get a high enough audio-level, you need to be very close. Such is the power of the convention though, that care must be taken using real ear flaps, in case they sound ‘unnatural'.
A wildlife sound recordist, besides needing a discerning ear and good technical ability, has to be a good naturalist. They need to log their recordings and identify the animals and behaviour. A Tsavo dawn chorus may have a dozen or more species calling.
An expert naturalist/sound recordist can also reveal gems. Recently Norbert heard tiny squeaks when recording elephants. They were infrequent – sometimes a day went by before they heard another. I suspect nobody else would have noticed it or, if they did, assumed it came from something small and crepuscular, like a reed frog. When they played it to us, we thought it sounded like the contact call that a baby crocodile makes to attract the attention of its mother. Norbert identified it, eventually, as coming from an elephant calf. In four years of filming, we'd never noticed it before.
Why aspire to put so much emphasis on natural sound, when surely movies are about emotion and nothing evokes emotion better than music? It's true, but we've all sat in films where we feel it's been overdone, where our emotions have been manipulated by relentless music. Where we have left, emotionally drained and feeling slightly cheated – any sense of appreciation for story, place or character, long subsumed by auditory overload.
Natural sounds have an ability to evoke a emotional response that is just as powerful. Unlike music, they are cross-cultural. Listen to a lion roaring close-by and, wherever you are from, it evokes a hair-raising, spine-tingling, primal response.
It is why we have put such an emphasis on recording in the field – Norbert has dedicated the last six months to it, and has recorded hundreds of hours. Before him, it was the responsibility of long-term team member, Pete Cayless.
Track 3: Lion duet
Natural sounds can be used in different ways. For a scene in our current film (www.facebook.com/theelephantmovie) we are investigating using the animal ‘voices', that Norbert and Pete have recorded, as if they were instruments.
Natural sounds can also impart mood. I remember a sound, in a film by Alan and Joan Root, that I thought was made by a wooden percussion instrument – it set up a feeling of tension. Later, Alan told us it was the staccato rhythm of a hammering grey woodpecker. We shamelessly borrowed the idea and used it in a scene where giant crocodiles stalked drinking wildebeest in ‘The Tides of Kirawira' (https://youtu.be/SV8dnp-7H3Q).
Ultimately, every film needs a balance of music and natural sound. The aim of the filmmaker is to transport the audience to the location, and then immerse them emotionally in character and story. Natural sound can play an important role in that.
There is no formula to getting the right balance – what works well in one film, can fail in the next.
It just adds to the alchemy – the heady mix of terror, excitement and serendipity that making a film is all about.

0 Pittsburgh officer charged with DUI after arriving at work intoxicated
PITTSBURGH - A Pittsburgh police officer has been charged with drunken driving after they allegedly showed up for work drunk.
According to the criminal complaint, 38-year-old Vernon Gibson, of Mount Washington, was seen by a fellow officer driving into the parking lot of the Municipal Courts Building about 11 p.m.
After exiting their SUV, Gibson was told by Sgt. Sean Duffy to get into their unmarked police vehicle to be taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital for mandatory, random drug and alcohol testing.
The complaint said Duffy “immediately noticed their [Gibson's] eyes were bloodshot, glassy and watery.”
It was also noted in the complaint that Duffy observed Gibson smelled of alcohol and had slurred speech.
Two breath tests were administered to Gibson upon arrival at Mercy Hospital. The lower of the two tests read .128 percent, exceeding the legal limit of .08 percent.
“It's unfortunate and it's embarrassing for Mr. Gibson and the City of Pittsburgh,” said Beth Pittinger, of the citizen's police review board.
Gibson was released on summons and is charged with two counts of driving under the influence. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 12, 2014.
Police officials said Gibson was already on administrative leave, though they haven't said why.
They were charged with insurance fraud in 2011 when they allegedly claimed their vehicle had been struck when police said Gibson damaged it themselves while trying to park. They entered a first-offender's program last year that court records show they have yet to complete.
Police union president Mike Laporte told Target 11 investigator Rick Earle that he's waiting to see the discipline. They also questioned the media's interest in the case.
“Pittsburgh police have the greatest level of stress, danger, forced overtime and scrutiny when compared to every other police agency in the region. Why is it newsworthy when one of them succumbs to humanity?” Laporte said.
However, Pittinger said Friday's incident should be the last straw.
“Here we are today, where there's been another incident involving him. So it's probably best for everybody if we part ways, but make sure that if he's looking for some support and help, that we give them that, too,” Pittinger said.
Richard Stanley, Gibson's neighbor, said, “You got people out here that look up to officers, kids that want to be a cop. To hear about this allegation, or whatever, people are going to start looking at everybody differently now.”

Brendan Gilmore Burke (December 8, 1988 – February 5, 2010) was an athlete and student manager at Miami University for the RedHawks men's ice hockey team. The youngest son of Brian Burke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and of the US Olympic hockey team, in November 2009, they made international headlines for coming out, advocating for tolerance and speaking out against homophobia in professional sports. Burke's coming out was widely praised and supported by sports news outlets and fans, generating multiple discussions about homophobia in sports, and in hockey in particular. They were viewed as a pioneer in advocacy against homophobia in hockey, described as "the closest person to the NHL ever to come out publicly and say that they are gay."[4]
Burke was killed in a car crash on February 5, 2010. Following their death, Burke's memory and contribution to LGBT awareness in hockey was honored by several hockey teams. The "Brendan Burke Internship" was later established in their honor by USA Hockey for their work in hockey management and a documentary entitled The Legacy of Brendan Burke aired on CBC Television in November 2010. Burke's death was the catalyst for the formation of the Can Play project, a campaign to end homophobia in sports.
Early life [ edit ]
Brendan Gilmore Burke[5] was born on December 8, 1988, in Vancouver, British Columbia,[6] and was the younger son and third of four children of their father's first marriage.[1] Their parents divorced in 1995, and in 1997 they moved with their mother, Kerry to Boston, Massachusetts.[7] During high school, Burke played hockey as a goaltender on the varsity team,[7] but quit because they worried that their teammates would discover that they were gay.[8] Instead, they told their family that they wanted to quit rather than spend the season benched off the active roster.[9] They graduated from Xaverian Brothers High School in Westwood, Massachusetts.[7]
After high school, Burke could not decide between going to law school (after completing college), or a career in hockey management.[2] They attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where they were a brother in Sigma Phi Epsilon and came out as gay during their sophomore year.[9] They interned on Capitol Hill in the summer of 2009 for U.S. Representative Bill Delahunt,[2] and became a student manager at Miami University,[8] responsible for recruiting correspondences, reviewing game film, working with coaches, and analyzing players.[9] During this time, they attempted to decide between a career in politics or hockey management, eventually deciding on the latter.[5][10]
Coming out and advocacy [ edit ]
“ Imagine if I was in the opposite situation, with a family that wouldn't accept me, working for a sports team where I knew I couldn't come out because I'd be fired or ostracized ... people in that situation deserve to know that they can feel safe, that sports isn't all homophobic and that there are plenty of people in sports who accept people for who they are. ” — Brendan Burke, ESPN.com
Burke came out to their family during Christmas of 2007[9] and to their father, then-general manager of the Anaheim Ducks Brian Burke, after attending a Ducks game in Vancouver on December 10.[1][7][9] Brian as well as the rest of Burke's family were accepting of their sexuality.[1] However, Brendan's father and older brother Patrick, also a hockey manager, were concerned about how this might impact Brendan's career in hockey, noting homophobia in the hockey world in particular.[9] As an advocate, Burke returned yearly to their high school to give talks on their experience coming to terms with their sexuality in a largely homophobic sports culture and the positive personal impact of their father's support.[11]
In November 2009, Burke came out to one of their teammates, Pat Cannone, after they were asked about their love life.[12] They then came out to the rest of the Miami University hockey team, of which they were also the video coordinator and student manager, that they were gay.[12] The story was leaked to ESPN.com.[1] The Burkes appeared on the Canadian sports channel TSN, where Brendan Burke said they hoped their story would give other gay athletes and those working in professional sports the confidence to come forward.[9] The team's coach, Enrico Blasi, and the rest of the team first learned of Burke's sexual orientation after the Frozen Four NCAA men's hockey championship in 2009.[7] Burke was concerned that the news story on their sexual orientation might be distracting to the team, and approached Blasi, offering to walk away from the story if Blasi disapproved.[10] With full veto power on the story, Blasi gave it their full support.[10] Their team was also accepting of their sexuality.[8]
Burke's public coming out was met with wide support from the press and fans,[13] with the ESPN interview garnering praise from the hockey world.[14] They received hundreds of emails and letters of support from gay athletes from across the continent.[9] The news of their father's acceptance of their sexual orientation also earned Brian Burke praise from press and fans inside and outside the hockey world.[13] The news further launched Brendan into advocacy, speaking about homophobia in hockey and encouraging discussion on the challenges faced by gay athletes in hockey and mainstream sports in general.[15][16] In a later TSN interview, Burke stated that they hoped that telling their story would allow gay athletes and pro sports workers to know that there were supportive, safe environments for them and would encourage them to step forward as well.[11] Toronto's Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) began using Burke's coming-out story as a teaching tool, stating that the story could "change so many families across Canada, particularly because so many young boys are expected to grow up playing with a hockey stick and make their dads happy."[17] Their coming-out story gained further attention from a large variety of news outlets in the days that followed.[13] Interest in Brendan's story was attributed to both their relation to their father and "hockey's sometimes homophobic culture."[13]
Brendan Burke became well known in hockey circles following their public coming out.[11] Blasi described Burke's presence as a "blessing," creating awareness within the program about homophobia.[18] TSN sportscaster James Cybulski commented that the reaction to Burke's story, and that it was a major story in the first place, demonstrated the need for Burke and their whole family to stand tall as a major step forward for all minorities.[19] GlobeSports.com's podcast Hockey Roundtable featured a discussion between sports writers Eric Duhatschek and James Mirtle about the dialogue concerning openly gay athletes and high profile employees in major hockey franchises that resulted from Burke's interview about their struggles with hiding their sexuality and eventual coming out. Duhatschek commented that NHL players were reluctant to discuss the recent news and the subject in general, attributing it to a culture of machismo in professional sports. Assistant coach of the Phoenix Coyotes, David King, stated that they felt that like athletic sports' role in breaking down the racial barrier, sports would do the same for gay athletes, albeit stressing that they felt it "would take some time." Mirtle agreed, discussing the challenges of prejudice that closeted and out hockey athletes may face and highlighting NBA star John Amaechi's 2007 coming out as an example of strong anti-gay attitudes in the NBA and larger sports world.[20]
Death and legacy [ edit ]
On February 5, 2011, the one-year anniversary of Burke's death, Brian Burke and their family are presented with special hockey sweaters in commemoration of Brendan Burke, which the RedHawks wore during their game that evening.
Burke died February 5, 2010, at the age of 21 in an automobile accident.[1][2][11][21] While they were driving in heavy snow near Economy, Indiana,[21] their 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee slid sideways into the path of an oncoming 1997 Ford F-150 truck, killing them and their friend, Mark Reedy, a Michigan State University athlete, who was in the passenger seat.[1][2][9][21][22] The impact of the collision fractured the base of Burke's skull, killing them instantly.[9] The vehicle was mangled to such an extent that police officers and paramedics could not tell that Reedy was inside the vehicle, dead as well.[9]
A moment of silence was observed prior to the Toronto Maple Leafs vs. Ottawa Senators game on February 6, 2010.[23][24] Another moment of silence was also observed prior to the Miami University hockey game vs. Lake Superior State on February 6, 2010. The team also named them honorary first star of the game.[25] The St. Louis Blues also held a moment of silence for Brendan Burke prior to their game against the Chicago Blackhawks on February 21, 2010.[14]
The funeral was held at St. John the Evangelist Catholic church in Canton, Massachusetts, where their family lives,[2] with nearly 1,000 people, including the full roster of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Miami University Hockey Redhawks, in attendance.[9][26] In April 2010, USA Hockey established the "Brendan Burke Internship" in honor of their work in hockey, describing it as being given annually to a recent college graduate seeking to pursue a career in hockey operations.[27] The senior class of 2010 at Brendan's high school alma mater coordinated a fundraising campaign to donate a statue to be displayed on the Xaverian Brothers High School campus in memory of Brendan. On November 26, 2010, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television newsmagazine the fifth estate aired "The Legacy of Brendan Burke", a documentary detailing Burke's story and the discussion it generated about homophobia in hockey.[28]
During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the United States Men's Hockey Team wore dog tags inscribed with the words "In Memory of Brendan Burke".[9][10] In June 2010, Chicago Blackhawks president John McDonough announced that they would be sending the team's recently won Stanley Cup with defenseman Brent Sopel who would march in the 2010 Chicago Gay Pride Parade. Sopel began their NHL career with Vancouver and became friends with Brian Burke when they were the general manager there. Although they were traded to Atlanta earlier in the week, Sopel honored Brendan Burke by using their day with the Stanley Cup to display it in the Chicago Gay Pride Parade,[29] stating to the press that honoring Burke's legacy and their father's example of familial support and tolerance was one of their reasons for marching in the parade.[30] In recognition of the one-year anniversary of Burke's death, the Blackhawks wore special sweaters during their weekend game on February 5, 2011.[12]
In the wake of Brendan's death, James Mirtle wrote in an article in The Globe and Mail published after Burke's death that they "was widely hailed as a pioneer in a sport that has never had an openly out athlete."[14] They were also described as "the closest person to the NHL ever to come out publicly and say that they are gay."[4] Assistant coach of the RedHawks Nick Petraglia attested to the commonplace use of gay slurs in hockey culture and stated that Burke's coming out impacted their program in addressing homophobia.[12] The New England Hockey Journal also wrote that Burke would be remembered as a pioneer for addressing the issue of homophobia in hockey.[31] Andrew Sobotka, president of the Chicago Gay Hockey Association, attributed a doubling in the organization's membership to Burke's legacy and the Cup's appearance at the 2010 Gay Pride parade, describing the continued debate about gays in hockey as "everyone carries their [Brendan Burke's] torch."[32]
Burke's older brother Patrick Burke announced in a column on Outsports.com that the Burke family promised their "unwavering, unremitting, relentless support" for the cause of equality in sports and to continue working to end homophobia in hockey.[10] Since Brendan's death, their father has continued advocating against homophobia in professional sports, giving speeches at schools, marching in the annual Toronto Pride Parade, and working with former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue, whose son is also openly gay, through PFLAG.[9][33] In March 2012, in tribute to Brendan, Patrick and Brian Burke founded the Can Play campaign to fight homophobia in sports.[34]
Teenage activists gathered at the Capitol for a quinceañera-themed protest of Senate Bill 4, organized by Jolt Texas. Read more about the event here: https://www.texasobserver.org/teenage-activists-stage-quinceanera-themed-protest-senate-bill-4-texas-capitol/ Posted by The Texas Observer on Wednesday, July 19, 2017
Fifteen teenage activists took to the Capitol Wednesday for a quinceañera-themed protest of Senate Bill 4, the so-called sanctuary cities ban.
Donning brightly colored dresses, tiaras and bilingual sashes with messages like “equality” and “sin racismo,” the young Latinas performed choreographed dances to songs like “Las Mañanitas” by Vicente Fernández on the South Steps of the Capitol while supporters, media and lawmakers watched and applauded. In between songs, the teenage demonstrators took turns speaking against SB 4, which they labeled discriminatory and dangerous.
Jennifer Ramirez, 16, evoked the Statue of Liberty as they hoisted a bouquet into the air while uttering the words immortalized at Lady Liberty's feet: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”
The one-of-a-kind protest was organized by Jolt, a new nonprofit aimed at leveraging the growing Latino population in Texas to turn the state blue. The group was founded in November after the presidential election.
Tania Mejia, the communications director for Jolt, told the Observer that the dresses were owned by each of the individual dancers from their own quinces.
“There are almost 11 million of us here in Texas,” Mejia said. “One in three voters in Texas is Latino, so when we come together as one people we will be able to defeat not only SB 4 but all attacks on our community.”
Reminiscent of the 3 a.m. mariachi protest that serenaded the governor's mansion in May, the “Quinceañera at the Capitol” used a cornerstone of Latino culture to drive home its point. Both demonstrations sent the same message: The communities that have always been a part of the fabric of Texas are no longer welcome in the state by Republican lawmakers.
Opponents of SB 4, one of the most divisive laws to pass the Legislature in years, have promised a “summer of resistance” to show their disdain. The law is set to take effect September 1, and its constitutionality is currently being challenged in federal court.
It's August, and the temptation to simply lay down tools and ignore the world around us is strong. However, it would also be a mistake, since the world continues to turn and since some people are working hard on their campaigns for the general election next spring.
Last week, I wrote about UKIP and their preparations, but today my focus shifts to the Tories, who have produced their – metaphorical and literal – joker: Boris Johnson.
Johnson – as I'll try to call them – has been teasing everyone with their will-he-won't-he routine on returning to Parliament for years now: the consensus seemed to have been that they would, but he'd do it in their own good time. In retrospect, as Isabel Hardman notes, this was probably their last opportunity before the Scottish referendum and the general election campaign proper. All the statements about not doubling up on being Mayor of London put me in mind of Shakespeare (NB – that will be as far as my literary allusions will go).
From a European perspective, all of this matters, because potentially Johnson's re-entry to the Commons would open up a strong possibility that they would become next party leader, should Cameron lose the election, which still looks more likely than not. To this extent, their view of the EU matters.
At the time of Cameron's Bloomberg speech, there was much debate of whether a defeat for the Tories in 2015 would not, in fact, actually make a Brexit more likely: Cameron would be ejected, and replaced by a a less unambiguously sceptical leader, who might then campaign in 2020 on a platform of withdrawal. My own view on this has been that the 2001 experience – William Hague saving the pound – should give at least some pause to that approach, but it certainly is a view that has played on the minds of many people.
If Johnson is now in effect a contender for leader, then does this strategy still play out?
It's telling that yesterday's announcement came on the back of the publication of a major report by Johnson' chief economic advisor on London and the EU. The report suggests different scenarios and argues that the best option is for the UK/London to remain within a reformed EU, followed by leaving it to pursue an international future, followed in turn by staying in an unreformed EU, followed by leaving and becoming inward-looking.
For many commentators pre-speech, the key take-home message from this was going to be that the UK could survive outside the EU just fine and that we have nothing to fear from Brexit. That is as maybe, but it ignores the preferred option, namely staying in and securing reform. It doesn't take much reflection to note that this is also David Cameron's position, and not coincidentally.
Johnson actually went further than Cameron and specified some areas for reform in their speech and it's worth reproducing that section here in full:
“We need to reform social and employment law so that we minimise the costs to all EU businesses, and if that means resurrecting the opt-out for UK which John Major secured and Tony Blair threw away, I don't think it will be a bad thing. I think the Prime Minister is right to want firms beneath a certain size to be excluded altogether from such demands.
We need further reform if not abolition of the CAP, so that we don't continue to waste taxpayers money and discriminate against third world producers – like the tariffs on cane sugar that are actually now threatening 800 jobs at a historic London refinery
We need managed migration so that we know how many people are coming in, and so that London government at all levels, the boroughs in particular, can plan for school places and welfare and all the rest
I agree with the Dutch, the Dutch want 54 areas of EU competence repealed now, they want a yellow card system by which national parliaments can stop unnecessary regulations
I think it's right that we should take the Home and Justice affairs back to an inter-governmental arrangement there's no need for ECJ decisions there
I want an end to the pointless attacks on the City of London – which is after all the asset, the financial capital of the whole of Europe
And I'd like to see a real focus on completing the single market for the benefit of the people and businesses that use it
Stop mouthing empty pledges like “ever closer union” with our fingers crossed, as Hugo Dixon has suggested, when we don't believe in that.”
This is actually all rather vague and mostly about the rhetoric aspect, rather than major reform. Johnson has long been a supporter of immigration – as is reflected in the report – which marks them out rather clearly from many in their party (not to mention Cameron himself), but taken as a whole, the list above is not such an inconceivable one to present to other member states, certainly in comparison with the kinds of things bandied about by the Fresh Start Group.
All of this really reflects on Johnson's nature as an individual and as a politician.
One of the reasons Johnson has been as successful as they have been their ability to convince others that he's on their side. One might cast this as pragmatism or as being a chameleon, but it has largely worked. Certainly, to read Sonia Purnell's very good biography of the man, it's opportunism writ large.
At the same time, Johnson is clearly no fool: Purnell repeatedly makes the point that they know full well what he's doing and that nothing happens by accident, however it might look. To get the largest personal mandate of any politician in the UK (as their Mayoral profile helpfully points out) requires one to be an operator as well as a rogue.
For many in their party, Johnson's return to Westminister will mean that Nigel Farage will be neutralised as a threat: a fighting fire with fire scenario. While this might work at the level of personalities, it doesn't really work at the level of policy, even if both men are pointedly vague much of the time. Johnson might be more acceptable than Farage, but they will face an uphill struggle on the immigration issue.
All of which points to a future European policy of careful tacking; working to secure changes, and working harder to be seen to make changes. If we can imagine a Johnson-led government, then I think we'd find that in practical terms it would look a lot like a Cameron-led one, albeit with better mood-music. And that still won't resolve the UK's current problem, namely not knowing what it wants out of the EU. For that, we'd need to find someone else altogether.
Months ago, I asked the Pentagon for its visual records of Osama bin Laden's sea burial under the Freedom of Information Act. Today, I received a thick packet of No— a complete denial that any records exist. Read it.
The core of the response is this: the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, United States Special Operations Command, and the Department of the Navy all had their records searched. Nothing. Admiral Mike Mullen's email was scanned. Nothing. The Pentagon claims not a single person aboard the USS Carl Vinson, where Bin Laden's remains were disposed of, took a single picture. Not a single email from the ship makes reference to photo or video. Essentially: nobody in the military has evidence. So did these things ever exist? If so, they're in a filing cabinet at the CIA, where they'll be safe for the rest of time.

Former UFC lightweight and welterweight champion B.J. Penn will take on Frankie Edgar some time in April of next year after the two serve as coaches on ‘The Ultimate Fighter 19'. This will be the former world champion's first time making the cut to 145-pounds and to do so they have added Mike Dolce to the team.
B.J. Penn adds Mike Dolce to the team in preparation for cut to 145-pounds
The man behind ‘The Dolce Diet' posted on their website what they thought about Penn making their return to the Octagon at the new weight class.
BJ Penn is the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.  They are a legend – a two-division world champion as a 170-pound welterweight and a 155-pound lightweight that has been fighting professionally before most athletes even knew what MMA or the UFC was. It is a great honor to join BJ on their journey back into the Octagon and, in my opinion, to make history as the first ever three-division world champion in our sport.
This will be a trilogy fight between Penn and Edgar, with “The Answer” having won both outings against “The Prodigy”. Penn has wanted this fight for quite some time and Dolce says that they wanted a ‘tough' Edgar.
First thing's first. We have a very tough Frankie Edgar standing in our way and in speaking to BJ, that is exactly the way they want it! I will be flying out to Hilo, Hawaii this week to begin growing my relationship with BJ and offer my skills to their camp.
Look for a lean and mean Penn to enter the Octagon against Edgar some time next April on their quest to make another run at UFC gold.
Legislation that is being crafted in Maryland could make the state the first in the nation to ban the sale of certain insecticides in an effort to save the declining honey bee population.
Separate bills have cleared the Maryland State Senate and Maryland House of Delegates and because they are similar enough, they are expected to be combined into a single piece of legislation for Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's consideration to sign into law, the Portland Press Herald reported.
The bill would specifically ban neonicotinoids, which are a class of pesticides that are a purported major contributing factor to population declines for bees. Honey bees are an important component in U.S. agriculture, as about a third of our diet is directly or indirectly tied to that species.
But insecticides are one cause that some say has attributed to declining hives and honey production. The Department of Agriculture reported that honey production tumbled 12% in 2015, with honey-harvesting colonies dropping 3%. Maryland lost more than 60% of its hives last year, said the Portland Press Herald.
Other states are considering similar action. And on the federal level, Representatives John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) last year reintroduced the Saving America's Pollinators Act of 2015, which would require the suspension of some insecticides until the Environmental Protection Agency can review if they are harmful to bees and other pollinators.
“The EPA plans to wait until 2018 before reviewing the registration of neonicotinoids. But America's bees cannot wait three more years,” said Conyers in a statement when they talked up that act. That bill still hasn't won approval in either the Senate nor the House of Representatives.
Story highlights "I just can't bear thinking about these moments," the victim's husband tells the court
Former detective Stephanie Ilene Lazarus, 52, could be eligible for parole in 22 years
They were convicted of shooting and killing Sherri Rasmussen, then 29
Rasmussen was the new wife of Lazarus' ex-boyfriend
A California judge sentenced a retired Los Angeles Police detective Friday to 27 years to life in prison for murdering their ex-boyfriend's wife in a jealous rage more than two decades ago.
Stephanie Ilene Lazarus, 52, was convicted of biting and shooting Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in their townhouse in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1986.
Lazarus, who rose through ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department and became a veteran art theft detective, could be eligible for parole in 22 years. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry gave Lazarus credit for time served in jail since their arrest at LAPD headquarters in June 2009.
A jury convicted them in March of first-degree murder.
Friday's sentence was the maximum under state law, prosecutors said.
Lazarus was charged with staging the crime scene to look like a burglary gone bad, and police long believed that Rasmussen was the victim of two male burglars.
The 1986 case went cold for years. Then it was reopened in 2004 and again in 2009, when DNA from a bite mark on the victim's arm came back as a match to the detective.
When Lazarus became a suspect, homicide detectives faced "special challenges as Lazarus' office was located next door to the detectives who were now investigating her," police said in a statement in March.
Rasmussen, a hospital nursing supervisor, was the new bride of John Ruetten, who had been Lazarus' college sweetheart. Married for just three months, Ruetten found their wife's body when they returned home from work. Rasmussen was brutally beaten and shot three times in the chest, authorities said.
Los Angeles County deputy prosecutors Shannon Presby and Paul Nunez submitted a written statement to the court prior to the sentencing, according to the prosecutor's office.
"Lazarus has never taken responsibility for their acts," the prosecutors wrote. "Lazarus has never expressed any regret or remorse for their actions. Lazarus' profound narcissism led them to kill and continues to motivate their denial of responsibility. This unrepentant selfishness poses a real and significant danger to any person whose interests conflict with Lazarus' egotistic desires."
Before the sentencing Friday, Rasmussen' mother, Loretta, told the court that their family has endured "extreme pain" over their daughter's murder.
"Every day we miss their laughter and their love," the mother told the judge.
In their remarks to the judge, a tearful Ruetten said Rasmussen was "just trying to save their own life" on the day of their murder.
"I just can't bear thinking about these moments," Ruetten told the court.
After the sentencing, Lazarus, manacled and dressed in a jail jumpsuit, waved and smiled to an apparent loved one in the courtroom gallery as they were escorted back to jail, carrying a folder.
Following Lazarus' conviction in March, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the case was "a tragedy on every level."
"Not only did the family of Sherri Rasmussen lose a wife and a daughter, a life that can never be returned, but also the LAPD family felt a sense of betrayal to have an officer commit such a terrible crime," Beck said in a written statement.
"I am also sorry it took us so long to solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy," they said.
Rasmussen, director of nursing at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, was a tall, athletic 29-year-old with a pretty smile.
At the time of the slaying, Lazarus was in their second year with the Los Angeles Police Department. The killing occurred on February 24, 1986, a Monday. Lazarus had taken the day off; Rasmussen had called in sick that morning. Authorities estimate they died before lunchtime.
Prosecutors argued that Lazarus was in love with Ruetten and distraught when they learned they married someone else.
During the trial, Ruetten testified they casually dated Lazarus after college, but they never considered them a girlfriend and dated other women while seeing them Lazarus eventually married a Los Angeles Police detective and the couple adopted a daughter.
According to prosecutors, the key to unlocking Lazarus' dark secret lay for years on the back shelf of an evidence freezer in the coroner's office. In a vial inside a sealed evidence envelope was a cotton swab. On that swab, prosecutors say, was DNA taken from saliva from the bite wound on Rasmussen's left forearm.
Testing in 2005 revealed the assailant was a woman. Some detectives, however, clung to the burglary theory and focused their inquiries on known female prowlers.
But from the beginning, the victim's family had pointed to an ex-girlfriend of Ruetten's who was a cop, and as the DNA testing advanced, undercover police followed Lazarus to a Costco store and retrieved a discarded soda from a trash can. Saliva traces from the straw matched the bite mark DNA, and they officially became a suspect.
Lazarus was confronted, and another sample was taken from them shortly before their arrest. Tests revealed the DNA found in the bite mark on Rasmussen's left forearm belonged to Lazarus.
Deputy Assistant District Attorney Presby told jurors during the trial that the chance of the killer being anyone else is "one in 1.7 sextillion."
To avoid botching an undercover investigation of one of their own, LAPD officials carefully devised a plan to arrest Lazarus. On June 5, 2009, Detective Daniel Jaramillo from the department's robbery-homicide division approached Lazarus at their desk in the department's headquarters and asked them to accompany them downstairs to the department's jail facility, where they would not be able to bring their gun.
They told Lazarus they needed their help interrogating a man who claimed to have information on stolen art, Lazarus' specialty in the detectives unit. A nearly hour-long recorded interview followed.
After one of the detectives alludes to the evidence that implicated them in the killing, Lazarus said, "Am I on 'Candid Camera' or something? This is insane. This is absolutely crazy. This is insane."
Minutes later they walked out of the interview room, only to be stopped, handcuffed and told they were under arrest in the murder of Sherri Rae Rasmussen.
Lazarus's attorney, John Overland, has argued in court that the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and couldn't be trusted.
Image copyright roman023 Image caption Rivers can become polluted from farms, run-off from roads and sewage works
Just 17% of England's rivers are judged to be in good health, according to Environment Agency figures.
This is down from 29% with a good ecological status in 2014. The analysis is shocking, say environmentalists.
Problems are caused by over-abstraction and pollution from farms, run-off from roads and effluent from sewage works - as well as invasive species.
The Environment Agency says the figures look bad because the EU's assessment criteria have been tightened.
"Threatens wildlife"
The figures released today are shocking and show us that things are worse than we thought Rose O'Neill , WWF
The EU asks nations to grade rivers into poor, moderate, good and high. Governments should aim for rivers to be "good" - that is relatively unaffected by human activity. "High" refers to upland streams in sparsely-populated areas.
The statistics show 0.08% of England's rivers are high quality; 17.06 good; 62.4% moderate; 17.22% poor and 3.24% bad.
Rose O'Neill from WWF said: "The figures released today are shocking and show us that things are worse than we thought. This is unacceptable and threatens wildlife and livelihoods.
"It's clear that we are failing our rivers and the wildlife they impact. We need to see government action to restore these rivers, for example by reducing abstraction and tackling pollution."
The Environment Agency feels aggrieved by the ratings.
Previously it used to judge a river based on various chemical tests. Now a river must be subjected to many tests on chemistry, flow and wildlife - and if it fails any single test it cannot achieve "good" status.
It says if you examine the tests individually, 74% of them achieve the highest two scores of good or high status.
Extra measures
A spokesperson said the agency has improved or stabilized the condition of nearly 2,000 miles of rivers.
They said: "The Environment Agency will continue to work closely with farmers, businesses and water companies to reduce pollution and improve water quality wherever, and however, possible."
Wildlife groups reject the phrase "wherever possible". They think the agency should be tougher with polluters and farmers who reduce the flow of rivers by taking out too much water.
The future criteria for measuring the health of river are currently under discussion.
Blueprint for Water, a coalition of 16 environmental and fishing organisations, urges the public to respond to the Agency's current consultation on River Basin Management Plans.
Farmers are concerned about who pays for the extra measures needed to meet the EU's rules under the Water Framework Directive.

Pittsburgh Public Schools may lose a $40 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation if the school district and the teachers' union cannot reach an agreement on teacher evaluations, CBS Pittsburgh reports.
Under the grant, which was awarded through the Gates Foundation's Intensive Partnership for Effective Teaching initiative, the union and the district were to develop criteria to evaluate teacher performance, with the goal of rewarding superior educators and retraining those who fell short. The district and the union, however, have been at odds for months over the criteria, and according to sources close to the talks, the foundation has said it will no longer fund the grant without a formal agreement between the two parties.
"The Gates Foundation made a significant investment in Pittsburgh because their leaders were committed to ensuring every student has an effective teacher in every class," the foundation said in an e-mailed statement to CBS Pittsburgh. "This is complicated work that requires collaboration, the commitment of the board, the superintendent and the union....We are disappointed by the current turn of events."
Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers president Nina Esposito-Vigitis told CBS Pittsburgh that the union agreed to a system of evaluation but that the minimum score that triggered retraining was set too high. “When teachers are weighed on a much more severe level than teachers across the state or the country, of course, you're going to lose teachers who are good teachers," said Esposito-Vigitis. Pittsburgh Public Schools superintendent Linda Lane said they twice lowered the minimum score. But that is not enough for the American Federation of Teachers, which is providing resources to help its local affiliate prevail in what it calls a "crucial fight."
Carey Harris, executive director of local watchdog group A-Plus Schools, told CBS Pittsburgh that the issue should be settled locally. “They need to get back to the table and work for kids and focus on the kids...put national interests and politics aside and work for kids.” Losing the grant would be “devastating to the school district,” they added. “It would be devastating to the city, but most importantly, it would be devastating to the kids.”

But for one 12-year-old boy in north west Tasmania it has led to an incredible discovery.
Robert Beeton was taking part in Bush Blitz, a program aimed at discovering and naming animals all over Australia, when they stumbled upon a brand-new genus.
"I've liked spiders since I was really little," they said.
"Gotta do what I do best."
They were on an Aboriginal youth camp, working with scientists and other enthusiasts to discover the undiscovered, when they came across what is now known as the paruwi spider.
Not only an undiscovered species, but an undiscovered genus, which they were then allowed to name.
"It was big and ugly, kind of dark, and it had tiger stripes," they said.
They were the one kid who was out the front, pulling up bark, looking underneath things. Jo Harding, manager of Bush Blitz
"Paruwi is the north-west Tasmanian Aboriginal name for beetle, and I named it that because it was my dad's nickname."
The Bush Blitz program has announced a further $12 million in Commonwealth and private funding that will ensure its continuation until at least 2017.
Manager Jo Harding says in the last four years 700 new species have been discovered in Australia.
"It's quite amazing to think that a country like Australia has about 75 per cent of its biodiversity unknown," they said.
"I was down in Tasmania with Robert as we were walking around looking for bugs and spiders together, and they were the one kid who was out the front, pulling up bark, looking underneath things," they said.
They say scientist Robert Raven and the rest of the team were tired and ready to go home, until Robert pointed out the spectacular specimen under a piece of bark.
"When Robert Raven saw what it was they just said 'Oh my God!'."
Ms Harding says Bush Blitz aims to get landowners and managers involved.
"Bush Blitz supports a whole lot of different non-government organisations, as well as property owners," they said.
"We don't just go and collect data that we want, we actually go onto these properties and collect data that's useful for the land managers too.
"That way they can better manage their properties, manage those species and continue to protect them.
"We have a saying at Bush Blitz: 'If you don't know what you've got, you can't protect it'."
While divorce perhaps doesn't have the same stigma connected to it as it once did, the practice is still a touchy subject in many parts of America. Indeed, as we will see throughout the article, it has changed drastically in law as well as in the attitudes of the general population across the history of the country.
What was once a forbidden practice and only every used as a last resort is now very common. The medium length of marriage in the US these days is around 11 years, and divorce rates have been rising steadily throughout the 20th century. Some 29% of marriages will suffer some form of ‘disruption' and in many cases lead to a divorce.
However how has divorce law changed over time?
Colonial Divorce
Even before the United States officially became the nation that we know it as today divorce was a hot topic in the colonies.
One of the earliest instances of a divorce law was in the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, who created a judicial tribunal that dealt with divorce matters in 1629. This legislative body was allowed to grant divorces on the basis of adultery, desertion, bigamy and in many cases impotence as well. In the North, the colonies adopted their own approaches that made divorce available whereas the southern colonies did all they could to prevent the act even if they did have legislation in place.
After 1776, divorce law was less restrictive. Hearing divorce cases took the legislature away from what they deemed as more important work, so it was handed to the judiciary where it remains today. The big problem at the time, for women, at least, was that they were a legal non-entity in the sense that it was difficult for them to claim ownership of property or financial assets which worked against them in the case of a divorce.
The Married Women's Property Acts in 1848 went some way to rectifying this, however throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries divorce remains relatively uncommon if we think of how much it is used today and women were at a tremendous disadvantage from the get go.
Early 20th Century
By the end of the 18th century, there were numerous ‘divorce mill' states or places such as Indiana, Utah, and the Dakotas where you could go and get a divorce. Many towns provided accommodation, restaurants, bars and events centered on this trade. In 1887, Congress ordered the first compilation of divorce statistics at a federal level to see how big the ‘problem' had become.
The Inter-Church Conference on Marriage and Divorce was held in 1903 in an attempt to use religion to ensure that divorce was kept to a minimum. However with the onset of feminism and the general relaxation of views towards divorce from a societal and moral standpoint, the practice was gaining traction.
In the 1920's trial marriages were established that allowed a couple to try a marriage without actually being married; not having kids or any lifelong financial commitments. In a way it was simply two people of the opposite sex living in the same quarters however for the time, it was a new concept and was one of the first ways in which the law tried to accommodate prenuptial contracts. In fact, marriage counseling was beginning to become popular as well and represented the recognition that a problem existed even if they law did not strictly prohibit it.
The Family Court
As the years rolled by and the nation found itself embroiled in two world wars, divorce took a back seat as far as lawmakers were concerned. However, the Family Court system that started in the 1950's was the first time in decades that the legislature and judicial system in the US tackled the divorce issue.
For years, couples had to go through the traditional court system to get a divorce or, at least, plead their case to do so. However with new laws in the place that established the Family Court, this created a way for judges to ratify agreements between couples for divorce that had been previously created. While the law used to ensure that a case had to be heard in a court of law, this now changed.
With these changes, law firms specializing in divorce started appearing all over the country –San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and just about every other large city soon became involved in these family courts.
No Fault Divorces
Possibly the biggest change to divorce law in the United States in its history came with no-fault divorces in the 1970's. Up until now there still had to be a party at fault. Even in the Family Courts, there was still a need for an adulterer or such like to be identified and then for the terms of the divorce to be agreed however with the change in the law then a divorce could be granted if neither party was at fault.
California led the way in 1969 however it wasn't until the 1970's that other states (Iowa being the second) adopted the law. In many respects, it was enacted to bring down the cost of divorce regarding hiring lawyers and expensive court fees from drawn out trials that didn't come to fruition. Divorce lawyers and financial advisors all still profited greatly from divorce proceedings even if both parties simply wanted to split and move on.
Something that this change in the law didn't focus on was child custody, and it remained a neglected topic. Laws to address this included:
While the law has attempted to create a fair an equal child custody process, it still isn't quite right in many respects and even with the legislation that has been enacted over the years there remains work to do.
Modern Day America
Divorce towards the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century was a much different proposition from a hundred years ago.
While there are new laws being enacted all the time to deal with the finer points of divorce the no-fault legislation essentially changed everything about the practice and made it into the divorce proceedings that we know today. That being said the attitudes towards divorce are still traditional in many quarters. Even though it has been set in law and that, in general at least, the stigma around divorce has gone it still plays a major role in affected a child's upbringing and other societal problems.
Furthermore, the equal share of property and finances is something else that the law is still trying to get right. Although this differs from state to state across the United States of America in most cases who is to blame doesn't always transfer over to who gets the property. The legislature and the court system are still trying to find a balance in modern day America between a system that allows for divorce without needing evidence of wrong doing and one that is fair and equal while also addressing the child factor as well.
It isn't easy, but there is still a lot of work behind the scenes to address it.
Conclusion
Divorces were being carried out before the United States of America was even a nation. The colonies had their own measures and laws for dealing with such things however for centuries they were largely used in extreme cases. Indeed, up until the No Fault rule, it was unusual to see a divorce that was granted on the basis that both parties simply wanted to break up.
This happens fairly regularly these days however back then there had to be a reason of some sort behind the divorce – women cheating on a man for instance or a man having several wives.
The big question now is whether or not the law can develop even further and change with the rising divorce cases across the country and the more complicated financial and property ownership models. Up until now, at least, divorce law in the United States has developed at a fairly fast rate. It might not always have favored the couple given that much of the early legislation was there to deal with extreme cases that were even frowned upon by the religious orders of the day.
Divorce law was very reactionary and has been throughout the past 300 years aside from a few isolated cases. It is still adapting to a growing trend however while the stigma of divorce has largely vanished in many places the law is still trying to keep up.
Eight years ago this week, Phil Weiser (now dean of the University of Colorado Law School) and I released "A 'Third Way' on Network Neutrality" in which we argued that that "the current state of the network neutrality debate, like many polarized issues, denies the reasonable concerns articulated by each side and obscures the contours of a sensible solution." We could have written the same statement today, for not only does this remain true, but in the wake of the Stop Online Piracy Act/Protect IP Act controversy, this particular tech policy debate is now even more polarized and ill-informed.

When I first became involved in telecommunications policy in the mid-1990s, the policymaking process looked very different. Telecom policy seemed at times like a sleepy technocratic backwater driven by inside-the-Beltway interests and objective expert advice. Congress regularly passed major telecom reforms on a bipartisan basis (who can forget Tauzin-Dingell?) and the divides were often more sectional than partisan, with some rural and "square state" interests often at odds with urban interests.
Some may be happy to see those days gone, welcoming the sharp scrutiny from the public and the media that current telecom policy issues receive. I, on the other hand, lament their passing. Those deals weren't corrupt — they were legitimate, bipartisan compromises, crafted by those who understood the trade-offs and their implications.
Today, not only is Washington far more partisan and acrimonious, but "grassroots" movements (in this case, so-called "netroots") play a much bigger role. And, unfortunately, telecom policy has been swept up in these partisan politics and circus-like atmosphere. Policy debates veer from one extreme to another with a real risk of losing the ability to find smart, well-reasoned compromises. And the media contributes by all too often failing to demonstrate a full grasp of the technical issues at play. Enter net neutrality.
Despite the furor over net neutrality after President Obama was elected, the 2010 Open Internet rules ultimately adopted by former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Julius Genachowski in part mirrored our "Third Way" recommendations: Ensuring transparency in broadband operators' network management, imposing strong rule against blocking of legal content, while still allowing at least some flexibility for reasonable network management.
Last January, the District of Columbia Circuit Court overruled some parts of those rules, and now current FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler finds themselves with the difficult job of threading the needle for a reasonable, third-way approach. Wheeler is currently trapped between two bad options: one flawed, the other terrible. The flawed option, pushed by many conservatives, is to have the FCC do nothing. This approach is not as unreasonable as it may seem. There is only one case of actual abuse (the Madison River case), all major network operators have committed to not blocking or degrading traffic, and there is no indication network operators desire discriminatory deals. Moreover, the alarming neutrality violations imagined by those on the left would likely be deterred by the potential PR firestorm and could be stopped by the FTC under current authority.
The left, pushing for the other extreme, argues for the terrible option — old style telephone, Title II regulation. Title II is so obviously a poor framework for Internet regulation that it is alarming to see the FCC treat this as a legitimate possibility.
These two positions obviously cannot both win. But worse, they imperil reasonable compromise. By holding out for no regulation, conservatives risk Wheeler's hand being forced by the netroots and so-called "public interest" groups to embrace Title II. The push for Title II dangerously radicalizes the debate — the claim that only Title II can really preserve net neutrality is not only false, but precludes progress on finding more reasonable solutions. If the left falls on its sword for Title II, it's likely to fail and get only the status quo.
Let's start simply, having some basic rules of the road make sense. The Internet's openness is key to its success as the most powerful platform for innovation and creativity the world has ever seen. If we can implement some appropriately flexible rules to safeguard that success, we should. Furthermore, those companies whose businesses rely on last-mile, consumer-facing networks need assurances that operators won't have them over a barrel. At the same time, operators deserve flexibility in managing their networks and in seeking out fair deals that make consumers and companies seeking to innovate better off. Underpinning all of this is the engineering fact that not all Internet traffic is the same and requiring that it be treated the same inherently discriminates against some kinds of bits (e.g., VOIP applications like Skype and Google Hangout) in favor of others (e.g., email).
Wheeler's proposed approach, based on Section 706 of the Communications Act, is grounded in the middle-way third way that Phil Weiser and I proposed eight years ago. Admittedly, this is freshly tilled jurisdiction for the FCC, and the key will be to see if Section 706 can carry the needed legal weight. But there is much work to be done to find an appropriate balance for everyone's interests, and it is time to get it underway.
Let's go back to the days of bipartisan, tough-minded compromises. Instead of debating over slogans and offering up apocalyptic propaganda about of the end of the Internet, let's start finding solutions the old-fashioned way.

It's one of the most common pieces of advice for any college student: In a competitive job market, you have to do something to stand out. Charlie Coggins did, and while their creativity may not be why the Panthers ultimately called, it certainly didn't hurt.
Coggins, East Carolina's long snapper the past three seasons, is one of 25-35 tryout players who have a shot to continue working toward their dream this weekend. Those invitees will join Carolina's five draft picks and a handful of qualifying Panthers at the team's two-day rookie minicamp.What makes Coggins' story interesting isn't that the Albermarle, N.C. native has already met Ron Rivera. The how they met Rivera is what's truly amusing.
Coggins wasn't invited to February's combine, but they went to Indianapolis anyway. The marketing major wanted to get their name out there, and since they couldn't do it on the field, they went where coaches and scouts spend their second most time in Indy: the bar.
Before making the trip, Coggins had a batch of beer koozies custom-made with their name, position, height, weight and school printed on the side.

There aren't many jobs if you want to play in the NFL. 90 guys are allowed on 32 rosters at this time of the year, which equals 2,880 spots. And there certainly isn't a high demand for long snappers. But even if Coggins' can't carve out a career in the pros, at least their marketing future looks bright.
When their 10 undrafted free agents officially sign on Thursday, the Panthers will have 86 players on the roster. That leaves four spots open, and at least a couple of those could go to players invited to try out this weekend.
The Panthers haven't yet released their list of invitees, but here are a few other names mined from Twitter:
And if you're wondering how much of a chance the tryout guys have, it's tough to tell. In 2013, the Panthers asked five back, but last year, it was just one.
MSNBC's Rachel Maddow had the highest ratings in the history of their program on Tuesday after hyping on Twitter they were in possession of "Trump's tax returns" about 90 minutes before the show aired.
BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC.
(Seriously). — Rachel Maddow MSNBC (@maddow) March 14, 2017

When including the broadcast networks, Maddow had the third most-watched program in all television on Tuesday, only behind the NBC hit "This is Us" and CBS's "NCIS: New Orleans."
Fox's "Tucker Carlson Tonight" finished in sixth place overall on TV with 3.015 million viewers, while CNN delivered 1.1 million.
The Form 1040 from 2005 showed that Trump reported $150 million in income and paid $38 million in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of about 24 percent.
The White House confirmed just before Maddow's program that the documents were authentic while slamming Maddow for releasing the documents and being "desperate for ratings."
Trump is the first president in decades to not publicly release their tax returns. They have said they would not release them while they are being audited by the IRS, but the IRS has noted that an audit would not prevent anyone from releasing the information on their own.
The hyped release on Maddow's show was widely mocked by media members on the left and right.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks on Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir at their Independence Day speech announce a new chapter in India-Pakistan relations, one that not only serves to equate Kashmir with Balochistan but also India with Pakistan. Both hold bad portents.
This is what Modi said:
Advertising
“Today from the ramparts of Red Fort, I want to greet and express my thanks to some people. In the last few days, people of Balochistan, Gilgit, Pakistan Occupied Kashmir have thanked me, have expressed gratitude, and expressed good wishes for me. The people who are living far away, whom I have never seen, never met – such people have expressed appreciation for Prime Minister of India, for 125 crore countrymen. This is an honour for our countrymen.”
The remarks were a continuation of what Modi said at the all-party meet on Kashmir earlier in the week. They had said at the meet:
“Pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes. The time has come when Pakistan shall have to answer to the world for the atrocities committed by it against people in Balochistan and PoK.”
And,
Advertising
“Ministry of External Affairs should make efforts to approach the people of PoK residing in different parts of world and collect information about the miserable conditions in PoK and bring them to the knowledge of the world community.”.
Baloch liberation activists immediately thanked Modi for extending their support to them.
Whether or not Modi's words mean that the gloves are now off and that Indian policy on Pakistan is to now officially include fomenting unrest in Balochistan, and PoK remains unclear but this is the impression that has now gone out to the world.
Read | One stroke of midnight and two futures: India and Pakistan chose differently
India, which has made a case in every international fora that Pakistan sponsors terrorism in Kashmir, has laid itself open to a similar charge vis a vis Balochistan and other areas of Pakistan.
Until now, New Delhi, despite its own mistakes in Kashmir, had managed to keep a high moral ground over Pakistan when it came to cross-border terrorism. Years of diplomacy and evidence gathering had gone into convincing the world that Pakistani terrorist groups, with recruits from the southern parts of the Pakistan province of Punjab, were being trained in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to launch attacks in Jammu & Kashmir and the rest of India.
Pakistan has maintained all along that India meddles in Balochistan and funds the Baloch Liberation Army. Pakistanis also believe that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which targets Pakistani citizens and security forces, are supported by Indian intelligence agencies. For years, Pakistan has pointed to the Indian consulates in Afghan border towns as launching pads for alleged Indian-backed terrorist activities in Pakistan. But apart from absurdly declaring that the terrorists it caught or killed were not circumcised — thus not Muslim and therefore RAW's covert army — and that weapons seized from them had Indian markings, it was never able to furnish solid evidence to support its claims.
Indeed, when the ill-fated India-Pakistan Anti-Terrorism Mechanism set up in 2006 met for the first and last time in 2007, Pakistan handed over a dossier with “evidence” of the Indian hand in Balochistan. It consisted of a 100 press clippings in a Sindhi nationalist newspaper whose owner lived in Delhi, and a photograph of an Indian High Commission official at a London meeting of Baloch separatists. With a dossier like that, even if India was engaging in covert activities in Pakistan, it was able to laugh off the claims.
Though the circumstances behind the April 2016 arrest of Kulbhushan Jadhav remain unclear, it was Pakistan's first real opportunity to change the optics. Pakistan claimed that the ex-Indian Navy man, no less than a high-ranking commodore, was in fact a serving officer and that they had been caught in Balochistan. Pakistan said they were behind several terrorist bombings in that restive province. India retaliated by giving a Baloch activist settled in the U.S, Naeela Qadir, a visa to visit India. They toured Delhi and Chandigarh, holding press conferences and speaking to the strategic community. That India was preparing to take a more aggressive line on Balochistan first came to light when last year, a Baloch activist living in New Delhi since 2009 came out in the open and addressed a public meeting in the capital about the Baloch struggle. But now with a few hundred words during their Independence Day speech and at the all-party meeting, the Prime Minister has themselves owned this policy, giving Pakistan a huge helping hand to drive home its Indian-hand claim about the Baloch struggle. Perhaps worse than this is that in one swoop, Modi has discredited the struggle's indigenous moorings.

Modi's remarks are hardly the language that an NSG aspirant, let alone a Security Council aspirant should be using but clearly Modi's advisers on these issues think otherwise. Even if New Delhi now claims that it is offering only diplomatic support to the “oppressed people” of Balochistan, that claim will be treated exactly in the same way that the world treats Pakistan's profession of “diplomatic support to the people of Kashmir”.
While those in India who call for a more “muscular” Pakistan policy applaud from the front rows, here are a few reality-checks on Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir:
There was a time when India did not want the “B” word mentioned with the “K” word as it was Pakistan that was intent on equalising “terrorism” in Balochistan with India's allegation of cross-border terror in Kashmir. Putting the two together in a joint statement in 2009 led to outrage in the BJP, unnerved Manmohan Singh and led to their abandonment by the Congress. After Modi's remarks, Pakistan will throw back “terrorism” in Balochistan every time India brings up Mumbai 2008, or Pathankot 2016, or cross-border terrorism in general.
What is done, but New Delhi hopefully knows that the struggle in Balochistan is not the same as the Kashmir problem.
Kashmir is contested between India and Pakistan and divided between the two countries. Balochistan's problem dates back to a dodgy accession forced on the Khan of Kalat by a newly formed Pakistan, but there is no other country involved. In that sense, it is more like the Naga movement for secession than the “azadi” movement in Kashmir.
What if China, with whom Pakistan has an evergreen relationship, pledges support for the Naga cause in the same way that India has promised to take up Balochistan? Also, India once carried out bombings in Mizoram, just as Modi has accused Pakistan of doing now.
As for Gilgit Baltistan, they are unhappy about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor because of environmental concerns, and how the regions rich natural resources may get plundered, but being united with India is not on their wish-list. What Gilgit-Baltistan wants most is to become Pakistan's “fifth province” so that it has the same constitutional rights, guarantees and privileges that the other four — Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa – enjoy. A majority of the people in G-B are Shia, so they also fear for their lives at the hands of terroists driven by Sunni extremism, but believe that once they become a province, they can better secure their lives. At the very least, G-B wants the same constitutional status that Pakistan Occupied Kashmir enjoys in Pakistan. The people of Gilgit-Baltistan have family connections in the Kargil region, but zero connect with New Delhi. There is no cause here for New Delhi to lobby except to claim that this region is part of undivided Jammu & Kashmir.

As for Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, there is no popular unrest there. There were a few protests by Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf , that it did not win any seats in last month's elections, but Khan is now famous for declaring every election rigged when they do not win seats. Even discounting the fact that the ruling party in Islamabad always wins elections in PoK, Nawaz Sharif's party, Pakistan Muslim League (N) won a landslide victory, taking 32 out of 42 seats. The military has an iron grip over PoK affairs, but much as India might wish, there is no people's movement against this. Most people living in PoK think of themselves as Pakistanis, and many of them have become Punjabi-fied.

If Modi's remarks mean that the gloves are indeed off, then the stage js now set for move and counter-move, not necessarily of the diplomatic kind, locking the two nuclear-armed neighbour in enmity forever.
Did Apple find inspiration for its iconic products in the simplicity of Braun designs from the 50s and 60s?
The huge success of Apple products over the last 15 years has regularly been attributed in part to their incredibly iconic designs.
But were Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder and former CEO, and Jonathan Ive, the company's Senior Vice President of Industrial Design, inspired by products designed by German consumer goods manufacturer Braun in the 1950s and 1960s?
German influence: Was the original iPod design inspired by Braun's T3 pocket radio?
Compelling visual evidence, compiled by Cult of Mac , suggests a number of Apple products that bear more than a passing resemblance to the simplicity of Braun designs from more than 60 years ago.
The original iPod from 2001, for instance, has similarities with the Braun T3 pocket radio from 1958. Other products that suggest a Braun influence include the PowerMac G5, the 2007 iMac and even the iPhone's calculator app from 2007.
In 1998, Apple launched the iMac, the computer that helped turn around the then struggling company. Designed by Ive, its success heralded their arrival as a design guru.
Influential figure: Apple designer Jonathan Ive (right) has spoken of the influence of Braun designer Dieter Rams (left) on their work
Ive has long acknowledged the influence on their work of Dieter Rams, who was Braun's head designer for nearly 30 years. In 2011, Ive wrote the forward for Dieter Rams' book 'As Little Design As Possible'.
'What Dieter Rams and their team at Braun did was to produce hundreds of wonderfully conceived and designed objects: products that were beautifully made in high volumes and that were broadly accessible', they wrote.
For their part, Rams is understood to regard Apple products - and Ive's kind words - as a compliment.
Design classics: There are similarities between the Braun LE1 speaker and iMac computer
Close-up images of the Braun T100 radio and PowerMac G5 show design similarities
The calculator app on Apple devices such as the iPhone may look familiar to anyone who used a Braun ET44

California Bike Paths are explicitly defined in Chapter 1000 of the Highway Design Manual (HDM) published by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Class I Bike Lanes are completely separate from traffic,[1] Class II Bike Lanes are on-street marked bike lanes and Class III Bike Routes are a street with signs denoting that it is a bicycle route; the street may also have sharrows.
Los Angeles County's bike paths are uncovered by any warranties as to fitness for safe cycling. This is in direct contrast to ordinary city streets. There are two pieces of case law which establish this clearly, one of them being Prokop v. City of Los Angeles.[2]
It is legal in Los Angeles to ride on sidewalks as long as riders do not show "wanton disregard" for the safety of other sidewalk users.[3] In California, when mounted and riding on the road, cyclists are required to "behave like vehicles" when it comes to obeying signals, signage, and lane restrictions.[4]

(This story appeared in today's edition of USA TODAY.)
With officials unable to find a replacement for injured opponent Manny Gamburyan, Chad Mendes has been pulled from the Feb. 23 UFC 157 event altogether.
But the former title challenger is getting what is arguably a bigger fight when Mendes (13-1 MMA, 4-1 UFC) meets fellow featherweight Clay Guida (30-13 MMA, 10-7 UFC) at UFC on FOX 7 on April 20, UFC President Dana White confirmed with USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com) on Monday.
The event takes place at HP Pavilion in San Jose, Calif. Mendes vs. Guida could be one of four fights featured on the network-televised main card, which follows prelims on FX and Facebook.
Since a failed title shot with champion Jose Aldo in early 2012, Mendes has posted back-to-back knockout wins over Cody McKenzie and Yaotzin Meza to put the division on notice. According to Mendes' manager, Mike Roberts, it's not surprising UFC officials couldn't find a replacement to keep them on the UFC 157 card.
“There's not a huge line of people that want to fight Chad, especially on two weeks' (notice),” they said. “But Chad is the best – if not, the second best – guy in that weight division, period. Chad's not going to turn anybody down. They believe they can beat anybody.”
He'll get that opportunity against Guida, who has the same strengths (wrestling and cardio) as Mendes. The former lightweight recently made the drop to featherweight and suffered a split-decision loss to perennial contender Gray Maynard. However, the high-energy Guida rebounded in January and edged Hatsu Hioki via split decision.
In addition to Mendes vs. Guida, UFC on FOX 7 also features a previously announced headliner of lightweight champ Benson Henderson (18-2, 6-0) vs. Strikeforce import Gilbert Melendez (21-2, 0-0). Heavyweights Frank Mir (16-6, 14-6) and Daniel Cormier (11-0, 0-0) meet in the co-headliner.
The latest UFC on FOX 7 card includes:
Champ Benson Henderson vs. Gilbert Melendez – for lightweight title
Daniel Cormier vs. Frank Mir
Nate Diaz vs. Josh Thomson
Matt Brown vs. Dan Hardy
Clay Guida vs. Chad Mendes
Roger Bowling vs. Anthony Njokuani
Jorge Masvidal vs. Tim Means

The Centre has earmarked Rs. 498 crore as financial incentive to companies for setting up call centres under a new BPO scheme, which is expected to create around 1.5 lakh jobs directly.
"A BPO empowers area where it is opened. There are a lot of international and domestic work that can be done at BPOs in India. Incentive is for total of 48,000 seats across will be given on per seat basis," Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a meeting with state IT ministers and Principal Secretaries.
They said that 60 percent of BPO workforce in the country comes from below tier 1 city and it will be convenient for such youth if they get job close to their home.
Government will float Expression of Interest under the BPO scheme after state governments submit their inputs, the Minister informed.
The Minister said that IT sector's profile is limited to only a few cities, which should be spread across small towns in the country.
The duration of scheme is till March 31, 2017.
"The total scheme outlay is of Rs. 498 crore. Out of this Rs. 10 crore is earmarked for creating awareness and publicity," IT Secretary R S Sharma said.
"It will create 1,46,400 lakh jobs directly. Broadly, it is estimated to benefit close to 5 lakh people," they added.
They said that government will give 50 percent of capital expenditure incurred or 1 lakh per seat whichever is less.
"We will divide 48,000 seats across states in ratio of their census population," Sharma said.
They said that while funding will be given by central government but state government will have to play an important role in providing assistance to these BPOs.
"State government departments can outsource their work to call centre to help them," Sharma said.
The Telecom Minister said that the scheme is part of government's digital inclusion programme.
"Some NGOs are running BPOs without government support.
Why can't we do it at national level? Big e-commerce companies are eagerly waiting for start of this scheme," Prasad said.
Behind Obama's Afghan withdrawal decision
21 June 2011
By the end of this month, President Barack Obama is expected to announce their decision on how many troops they will withdraw from Afghanistan come July, their self-imposed deadline to—as they put it in December 2009—“begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan.”
They made the pledge in a speech announcing their “surge” of an additional 33,000 troops into the war-torn country. Since coming into office at the beginning of 2009, the Democratic administration has tripled the size of the US military force deployed in Afghanistan, which now totals nearly 100,000.
In the year and a half since Obama delivered this speech, they and other US officials have sought to minimize the importance of the July 2011 deadline, stressing that it is only the beginning of a process that will be determined by conditions prevailing in Afghanistan and on the basis of consultation with military commanders.
Yet, with polls indicating that fully two-thirds of the American public oppose the war and nearly three-quarters want to see a “substantial” withdrawal, and with war costs mounting to $2 billion a week in the midst of relentless social spending cuts at home, attention has inevitably focused on the deadline.
The Pentagon has made it clear that it wants to keep the withdrawal down to a token number of support troops, while maintaining the US combat force on the ground in Afghanistan intact, at least through this and next year's summer “fighting seasons,” when the Taliban and other armed groups opposing the US-led occupation launch their military offensive. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who is leaving their post at the end of this month, has publicly insisted that any withdrawal be “modest” and that the US not “rush for the exits” in Afghanistan.
Leading members of Congress, including some Republicans, have called for a more accelerated withdrawal. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, has advocated pulling out 15,000 US military personnel next month, including combat troops.
Levin's proposal would still leave 85 percent of the US force in Afghanistan, fully 50,000 of the additional 65,000 troops that Obama dispatched to the country since early 2009.
While the media has focused its attention on this rather limited public debate in Washington, behind the scenes, US officials are carrying out two sets of negotiations that provide insight into the real objectives of this nearly decade-old war.
Defense Secretary Gates confirmed in a televised interview Sunday that US negotiators are in talks with representatives of the Taliban, the Islamist movement whose regime was overthrown by the October 2001 US invasion.
At the same time, the US has pushed the United Nations Security Council into separating the international sanctions imposed upon the Taliban from those applied to Al Qaeda. Washington's ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, praised the move, calling it “an important tool to promote reconciliation” that would send “a clear message to the Taliban that there is a future.”
Given the past several years of US commanders delivering body counts—vastly inflated by innocent civilian victims—of alleged members of the Taliban killed or captured, this promise of a “future” might seem incongruous. For nearly a decade the American public has heard politicians and generals alike equate the Taliban with Al Qaeda and insist that the entire war is being fought to defeat terrorism and prevent another 9/11 on US soil.
Even though talks have begun, Gates stressed that this did not mean there should be any let-up in US military operations. “I think that the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure, and begin to believe they can't win before they're willing to have a serious conversation,” they told CNN.
Thus, US troops will continue to kill and die in Afghanistan, but for what? The pretense that they are defending America from attack has lost all credibility.
The second set of quasi-secret negotiations is being conducted with the US-backed regime of President Hamid Karzai on a strategic partnership agreement that would assure the access of the Pentagon and NATO to permanent military bases on Afghan soil. Amid the public talk about withdrawals, these private discussions are aimed at keeping American forces in Afghanistan for decades to come.
On Saturday, as a US delegation sent to negotiate this strategic agreement arrived in Kabul, President Karzai delivered a nationally televised speech in which they lashed out at the US and its NATO allies. “They're here for their own purposes, for their own goals, and they're using our soil for that,” said Karzai, who also denounced the occupation forces for killing Afghans and degrading the country's environment, including through the use of depleted uranium munitions.
Karzai's protest is a pale reflection of the overwhelming popular hostility to the US-led occupation force among Afghans, which the puppet president and their cohorts justifiably fear could destroy them.
At the same time, Karzai and their coterie no doubt fear that the arrangements Washington is trying to make for a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan—including through unilateral negotiations with the Taliban—may include dispensing with their services.
Like previous regimes in Afghanistan, Karzai is increasingly attempting to balance between Washington, whose troops and money keep them in power, and America's regional rivals, which are growing increasingly wary of US strategic aims in the region.
Thus, last week, Karzai attended the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Kazakhstan, where the SCO's leading members, China and Russia, moved a resolution calling for an “independent, neutral” Afghanistan, an unmistakable declaration of opposition to a continued US military presence in the country.
American troops are fighting and dying in Afghanistan neither to defeat terrorism nor to champion democracy. The real objective of this war is to secure for US imperialism a base of operations for projecting its domination over the energy-rich region of Central Asia and for control over the pipeline routes for funneling this natural wealth to the West.
With its failure to achieve this objective in 10 years of war and occupation, Washington is confronting growing opposition from its strategic rivals in the region, above all China and Russia. The immense suffering and instability wrought by the dirty colonial-style war in Afghanistan increasingly threatens to spill over into a far wider regional and global confrontation with incalculable dangers for working people across the planet.

OAKLAND (CBS SF) – The Oakland A's are shifting their focus from building a new South Bay ballpark to retrofitting the Oakland Coliseum as part of a new 10 year lease agreement.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that the new lease would run through the 2024 season and calls for the A's to spend $10-12 million on upgrades to the facility, including new scoreboards.
“We hope to have (a deal) as soon as possible,” A's managing partner Lew Wolff told Phil Matier and Andrew Ross of the Chronicle. “It's really up to Oakland now.”
The franchise has been attempting to relocate south for years, but the Giants claim territorial rights to Santa Clara County. Baseball has been looking into the issue for years but has never ruled definitively on the matter, sparking an anti-trust lawsuit from the city of San Jose.
While examining brain tissue through a microscope of hospital patients in the 1930's, Hungarian neuropathologist Ladislaus Meduna made an intriguing observation: Brain cells, called glia, increased greatly in tissue taken from people with epilepsy. But samples from patients with schizophrenia and depression had far fewer glia in the cerebral cortex than normal.
Unlike neurons, glia cannot fire electrical impulses, so they were (and still are) largely ignored by most neuroscientists. But Meduna speculated that schizophrenia and depression might result from a deficiency of glial cells, so they reasoned that by inducing a seizure, they could increase their numbers and cure their patients. On January 23, 1934, they induced a violent seizure in a man who was hopelessly catatonic from schizophrenia by injecting a chemical, camphor, into the man's bloodstream. The injection induced an explosive seizure that wracked the man's body for a full minute. Meduna's legs gave out in shock after they saw what they had done. The scientist collapsed and two nurses had to help them back to their apartment to recover. Undeterred, Meduna four days later induced another seizure in the same man—who for four years had never spoken or moved and who had been fed continuously through a tube. By the fifth seizure they induced on February 10, 1934, the man awoke, dressed himself, requested breakfast and greeted Meduna cheerfully by name. “I hear them talking that you were going to make some crazy experiment? Did you do it?” they asked
This success inspired others: Ugo Cerletti and Lucio Bini in Italy used electricity to induce a seizure by applying electrodes they had obtained from a pig slaughterhouse to the head of one of their mental patients on April 11, 1938. Did the patient get better? In some cases, patients who underwent these primitive procedures experienced improved mental states noticeably. But they could also induce violent, whole-body contractions that sometimes dislocated joints and broke bones.
Kinder and Gentler ECT
Today, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), as it is referred to by physicians, is still a part of the psychiatric armamentarium. But the patients who now receive it—after having failed other treatments, whether pharmaceuticals, talk therapy or even other forms of electrical stimulation—undergo less of an ordeal than did Meduna's patient.
Wendy Marie Ingram, a psychiatric epidemiologist at Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania, is studying ECT to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from the procedure, described the first time they witnessed a patient undergo ECT. “The first person I saw was a male,” Ingram says. “The previous week they were completely nonresponsive [catatonic]—couldn't even respond to their name.” The anesthesiologist inserted a soft rubber guard into the man's mouth to prevent them from biting their tongue, and while they were under anesthesia, resting tranquilly under the influence of muscle relaxants, the technicians applied two electrodes to their head and delivered pulses of high-voltage electricity into their brain. “It was amazing how calm everybody was…efficient, like watching a surgery,” they note. “Everyone was warm and kind and spoke to the patient, even though they aren't particularly responsive [because of their catatonia].”
In contrast to the horrifying scenes dramatizing shock therapy in movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, violent seizures did not wrack the patient's body when the high-voltage switch was thrown. “You see the body tense for a period of time and then it relaxes—that's it,” Ingram says. “It's amazing,” they add, “patients who are severely depressed, suicidal or catatonic are given ECT and two weeks later they are up, happy, chatting with the physicians and nurses.”
Used on over 100,000 people a year in the U.S., ECT is highly effective in treating severe depression, bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses. But it does not always work—and some health providers now shy away from the procedure. “I was watching people stay sick, says Jessica Eure, professional counselor at the Virginia Center for Neurofeedback, recalling their work in a mental hospital with severely psychotic, suicidal and homicidal patients. “They give them ECT and it gets them perked up for a couple of months—but then you are back to where you were, but maybe with some memory loss. It was really upsetting to me.” Discouraged by ECT, Eure now uses neurofeedback that monitors a patient's brain waves to treat people with a range of mental illnesses.
The efficacy of any medical treatment depends on scientific understanding of the disorder, and how the treatment is applied. But that insight is largely lacking with ECT—and there is no consistent method of administering the technique throughout the U.S. A survey of legislation across the nation, just published online in advance of print in the The Journal of ECT, finds laws regulating ECT vary widely from state to state. Six states have no regulation at all on ECT, limiting who can administer or receive the treatment, who can provide consent, how it is practiced or administrative requirements on reporting. Other states are so restrictive, a court order is required in some cases.
The methods of administration also differ. “The power, the frequency, the electrode placement…the number of treatments and the duration of the treatments are also variable,” Ingram says. “The piece that is really missing is, what is a therapeutic seizure?” According to Ingram, extremely long seizures are associated with worse adverse events such as memory loss. But weaker ones, like those induced by stimulating only the right side of the head instead of both sides, produces less memory loss, but also has less therapeutic benefit. Why one procedure might be better than the other is unclear. “The neuroscience is completely unknown. It's baffling to me,” Ingram says. It is not even clear the seizure itself is the most important factor. The amount of suppression of brain activity that is often, but not always, seen immediately following the seizure, called postictal suppression, may be a better indicator of therapeutic benefit.
A better understanding of how the procedure works is needed to allay concern for undesirable side effects and fear of potential abuse fuel negative stereotypes about ECT. “The procedure has been so horrifically portrayed in media...showing it being used in mental facilities as punishment, not for its tremendous therapeutic effects,” Ingram says. Nazi doctors even perverted shock therapy to systematically euthanize thousands of mental patients in the abhorrent “racial hygiene” program, beginning in 1944
Frustrations of Medical Records
To gain a better grasp of ECT, Ingram and their colleagues Sharon Larson, Stanley Poler and Fatin Nahi sifted through electronic medical records of 127 patients in Geisinger Health System. In total, the patients had undergone a total of 2,023 individual ECT treatments between 2013 and 2017. Their goal: to find clues to how ECT works, why it sometimes fails, why some people experience significant side effects and to identify the best procedures to maximize the benefit of the procedure and reduce its risks.
One key question they decided to explore is whether anesthesia—used to prevent convulsions—undercut the effectiveness of the procedure. Ingram presented preliminary data on their group's findings at the 2017 Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington, D.C., in November. The data showed the type of anesthesia did have a significant effect on the duration of the seizure. The anesthesia propofol, the study found, reduced seizure duration significantly more than the anesthetic methohexital. Neither drug affected the postictal suppression. With this finding, the researchers set about trying to determine whether it was the seizure duration or the postictal suppression that produced the best outcome by assessing whether patients who had received either anesthetic showed the greatest reduction in depression following ECT. Depression is measured quantitatively by the Beck Depression Inventory, a series of questions psychiatrists use to score the severity of a patient's depression.
Inspecting the medical records more closely revealed to what degree ECT has become a medical backwater. The electronic medical records showed that only 21 patients had been given the diagnostic test after the treatment, making any correlations researchers might find too weak to achieve statistical significance. Contrast this with almost any other medical treatment. Would any doctor fail to record changes in their patient's blood pressure after prescribing a drug treatment? Ingram then attempted to compare the number of patients who had been readmitted to the hospital after the treatment with the anesthesia they had received, but only 18 patients relapsed within 30 days of receiving ECT. This provides a clue to the efficacy of the treatment, although it leaves researchers with too little data to answer the critical scientific questions necessary to make ECT as safe and effective as possible.
Ingram, a neuroimmunologist and biophysicist, turned to epidemiological research because they felt their laboratory study at the cellular and molecular level was not leading to the needed understanding that would result in treatments for mental illness. “You have to use clinical informatics to study people, especially with these complicated, human-specific mental illnesses, and especially affective disorders—depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, which are unique to humans,” they say, and then use those findings to inform biological experiments in animal models. What is urgently needed, they add, is better reporting of ECT treatments in medical records from all institutions into a central database for epidemiologists to analyze. Depression, bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses affect nearly everyone directly or indirectly. Of those 18 years of age and older in the U.S., 1.1 percent of the population will develop schizophrenia—and according to Ingram, the incidence is even higher for bipolar disorder (2.5 percent) and major depression (5 percent). Suicide is the second-most common cause of death in the U.S. for people in the prime of life (ages of 10 to 34), according to U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention statistics (pdf).
In an interview after their presentation, Ingram's passion broke through the dry clinical detachment of a scientist discussing data points. “Depression is a life-risking disorder,” they say. Retaining their professional composure, but suddenly gripped with emotion they add, “I lost my cousin to suicide and depression. One of the last-ditch efforts was ECT therapy and it failed, and they ended up committing suicide.” Them research on depression predated this personal loss but the tragic experience infuses their scientific work. “One of the most important things that is preventing us from getting at the mechanisms of treatments and the mechanisms of the etiology of the disease is the social stigma against mental illness in general. Society needs to change its mind and acknowledge that mental illness, especially mood disorders, is not a decision of the individual, it is not a character flaw, it is a biological disease, and it has genetic and environmental and behavioral components.” This stigma discourages people from seeking treatment, stifles their participation in scientific studies and reduces research funding for mental illness, Ingram says, noting the National Institutes of Health budget for cancer research in fiscal year 2017 is $5.5 billion in comparison to only $1.5 billion for mental health. “We conducted this study with only a $2,000 internal grant.” (The White House's proposed budget for 2018 would cut funding for both institutes to $4.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.)
Legal and Funding Gaps
Negative stereotypes have thwarted the effort to achieve best practices and legislation for ECT treatments. Justin Coffey, one of the co-authors of the study on legal regulations on ECT in the U.S. and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral Sciences at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, is especially concerned about the harm caused by overregulation. “Laws that protect patients are good,” Coffey says. “In the case of ECT, however, some state laws do just the opposite—they restrict access to what is an extremely safe and often lifesaving medical treatment. Such laws are not based on medical science. “In Texas, where I practice, I see 14-year-old kids with severe depression and certain forms of autism, conditions where ECT can be lifesaving—but the law does not allow me to provide the care they need, the care that is medically indicated.” Coffey says they are sometimes forced to direct families to seek professional help in other states where ECT is “not hindered by laws based on stigma rather than fact.
For their part, Ingram places medical knowledge about mental disorders, in general, within a larger context. “Cancer 50 years ago is where we are at right now with mental illness, back when we didn't know anything about the causes,” they say. “When we didn't have anything to treat it well, people hid it. They would get a lump in their body and they would hide it. It was taboo, and there was fear around it.” Along the way the attitude toward cancer changed. “People now wear proudly the ribbons of breast cancer survivor, and they have contributed to research that is associated with that disease, they say. “It is normalized; it is medicalized. The same thing needs to happen with mental illness in order for us to make the big leaps we need to.”
× Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation Employment Protections Added To ATU
RUSSELLVILLE (KFSM) – The Arkansas Tech University Board of Trustees voted on Thursday afternoon (Aug. 21) to add gender identity and sexual orientation employment protections, according to a news release.
Policies were updated when the board voted to make an amendment to the Arkansas Tech University affirmative action policy, the release states.
The change was made to comply with provisions of Executive Order 13672 from President Obama that added sexual orientation and gender identity as protected categories for equal opportunities in employment.
The University of Arkansas made a similar change to its own campus policies in June, according to a spokesperson for the campus.
Its change came in the form of adding sexual orientation and gender identity to their own nondiscrimination policy, the spokesperson said.

Epicurus and Lucretius on love and death
4 February 2002
Scribe: Ruth Lancashire
These minutes were not spoken; for another version, go to the spoken minutes
What possibly could be a better lecture than one on Woody Allen? Woody Allen often writes their films about two ideas that, as humans, overwhelm our minds, one of which we attempt to achieve, and the other attempt to ward off. Woody Allen goes where not many other men have dared to go before, they write about love and death, as did the philosopher Lucretius, who attacks love and makes us think clearly about death.
Being only a one hour lecture, we were forced to skip over most of the mortality of the soul portion of readings, but not without a brief discussion, of course. Lucretius goes against the grain of most of the philosophers we have already studied. They state that the soul is mortal, not immortal; it dies when the body dies. They use at least twenty-eight separate arguments to support their case. Nowadays we recognize many ways in which certain biochemical and hormonal changes in the physiological aspect affect the mind as well as the rest of the body. In modern times there is no longer really a debate. The mind does not exist of separate matter; it is part of the body. It lives with birth, and dies in death.
After a brief look at the Lucretius' view on the mortality of the soul, we quickly moved on to book four . This section is a controversial one about love and sexual desire. It begins with the discussion of mind issues, such as, dreaming, wondering and imagining. Lucretius attempts to give an explanation for sleeping and dreaming. He, yet again, goes against the views of their fellow philosophers and states that dreams are nothing but images in our head. They are not prophetic, and are not a form of communication between the Gods and the individual. A student then stated that this should be fairly obvious to people. If one spends their day pushing a button, then most likely, they said, he's going to dream about it because their mind has been occupied with it all day. Professor Hutchinson agreed quickly with the student's comment stating that dreams do have a lot to do with experience, but then asked how we can explain dreams about the future. They also pointed out to the class that only one other philosopher, up until Lucretius, had taken this standpoint about dreams, the other being Aristotle, who did it in a less obvious way. Epicureans, Hutchinson stated, believe that dreams are just night time perception.
With a clever and sudden transition at 4.103, Lucretius shifts our focus from dreams to sexual desire; Lucretius' transition topic is wet dreams, and readers suddenly find themselves reading about sex. Lucretius views sexual desire as an injury; the mind is wounded with the invasion of love. Hutchinson points out that Lucretius often juxtaposes the depiction of pleasure with an immediate cold shower of a depiction of regret, frustration, and absurdity.
In 1142 a connection to Plato's Republic (474d+) was pointed out by Hutchinson to the class. Lucretius describes the desire of women. In The Republic Plato discusses the idea of creating special names for our loved ones.
Found in 1090, is the attempt to heighten the metaphor between sexual desire and injury. The reading states that once you've had it [sex], you always want more. Lucretius compares sex to dreaming of food. The images are there, but when you wake up you are still hungry, your craving has not been satisfied. They state that sexual desire can never be satisfied. If one is hungry, one can eat and become satisfied with being full, but one does not take anything away from sex or become connected to their lover, there is no point because there is always desire.
Food, drink, and sex are great temptations, all being natural and pleasurable. But with eating, we often do not find the pleasure in it because we have grown accustomed to it. Professor Hutchinson then re-counted a story about a friend of theirs who was unable to digest food for a long period of time. After they were able to start again, they found great pleasure in digestion, a pleasure that most of us do not notice.
Clearly sex is a less urgent need, but it is natural. One becomes satisfied when one eats, but does not become satisfied when one makes love. Hutchinson pointed out that this suggests a deep confusion in the act of sex; it is natural and pleasurable, but one shouldn't have it. But what Lucretius is saying is that the real problem is letting yourself fall in love. The cold shower is turned on full at 1172 where Lucretius states that every woman is the same, one like the other. They tell their reader that they (the one who has fallen in love) was able to live without them before, so why can they not now? They speak very cynically about love.
Epicureans suggest that love, sex, and friendship must remain separate. One must cultivate as many friendships as possible, and indulge in risk free sexual desire since it is not a necessary desire or need. As professor Hutchinson pointed out “no guy ever died from not getting laid.” The decision to have sex should weigh the downside risk, not the imagined upside potential. It was determined who the individual could have sex with, for example, the daughters of prominent men were off- limits. To the Epicureans, sex is fine as long as the other person is consenting, BUT make sure you don't fall in love. The professor then re-counted a college meeting at which they were in attendance. They asked the participants if they had to live without either love, sex, or friendship, which would it be? Hutchinson stated that the least number of people were willing to give up love. A question then comes into play, where does family come in? For the Epicureans, marriage was to be avoided at all costs. One should only marry if they are mature enough to handle the challenge. Sex should be separated from the family.
The lecture then moved on to something, as mortals, we cannot avoid, death. A topic, Hutchinson points out, that Mr. Allen is successful at in creating in their films, the sense of anxiety one feels about the subject. Then again, Lucretius is also successful at this. The idea of death for the Epicureans was not a reward and punishment system, which was the basis of most other religions and beliefs during their time. Their idea was a very politically subversive one. David Hume, who died in 1776, was an Epicurean, and at that time in the UK held an illegal opinion about death. They were a known Epicurean, and on their last days was completely cheerful and content, even in the site of death. Their friend Boswell had visited them days before they died and Hume joked about death. After their death Boswell was unable to sleep for months, until they dreamed that Hume had changed their mind and been let in to St. Peter's gate. Two hundred and twenty five years have passed since that time, and as professor Hutchinson showed us, viewpoints have changed as well. In funerals we do not mourn the deadly sensations the individual must have felt, but we mourn the pain and grief for that of their close relatives.
Hutchinson, again, related the topic to a personal story. Their good friend Don Fowler passed away three years ago, leaving a half grown up daughter, and a widowed wife. They were a known Epicurean, in fact that is how they and their wife had met, through the love of philosophy. They wrote a note which was posted in the memorial program. They stated that they had been a fortunate man and had died happy. Then, in defiance of the grim reaper had the memorial sing “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.” Hutchinson had proved the changing ways of the world. Fowlers' attitude is not a normal one, but it is one that is understood and accepted, when just 225 years ago it was outlawed.
Upgrade your Events and Projects to FCPX 10.1 Libraries the smart way
Philip Hodgetts has put together this article on how to upgrade FCPX 10.9 Projects and Events to the new version, 10.1. They know their stuff and now that Event Manager is free, it makes updating even easier.
Before running Final Cut Pro X 10.1 the first time, read this-
One of the most exciting new features of Final Cut Pro X 10.1 is the introduction of Libraries. Libraries now contain both Events and Projects in one package, very similar to classic Final Cut Pro “projects”. This is a huge improvement, but of course it leaves no role for Event Manager X with Libraries, which are well managed within Final Cut Pro X 10.1. Except Event Manager X is the best tool to use during the migration to Final Cut Pro X Libraries, therefore from today it's free.
Libraries contain Events and within those Events are Projects (and Compound Clips). One major difference is that media can be stored in the Event folder(s) within the Library, or independently of the Library. (See my article on the new features of Final Cut Pro X 10.1 for details.)
Smarter Upgrading
In this article I'm going to explain how to use the free Event Manager X to smooth the upgrade path to Libraries. Instead of upgrading each drive into one mega library, using Event Manager X allows you to control the upgrade and build your Libraries to better reflect the combinations of Events and Projects that make up logical tasks. Using Event Manager X to manage the transition, you can load in the related Events and Projects, and then have Final Cut Pro X 10.1 convert just that selection to a Library. The workflow is simple:
Use Event Manager X to load up related Events and Projects
Run Final Cut Pro X to convert that combination to a modern Library.
Rename the Library from the default Library name given by Final Cut Pro X.
Repeat for each combination of Events and Projects you have.
We created Event Manager X very shortly after Final Cut Pro X's initial release to meet the obvious need to manage the visibility (and memory usage) of Events and Projects. Being a small software company enabled us to be very nimble and release Event Manager X within two weeks of Final Cut Pro X 10.0. Since Event Manager X we've been proud to add a lot of value to the Final Cut Pro X ecosystem with our XML translation apps - 7toX for Final Cut Pro, and Xto7 for Final Cut Pro - and our metadata workflow tools Producer's Best Friend (reporting), Sync-N-Link X and Change List X .
If you do want to keep informed of new applications or updates, like us on Facebook . If you work in reality or documentary you might be interested in checking out our real-time, on-location muscular logging system for Final Cut Pro X - Lumberjack System.
Upgrading Apple's Way. Apple provides a perfectly reasonable upgrade path. For each hard drive that gets upgraded you will be provided with one Library for all the Events and Projects on that hard drive. Now, if you've organized things logically by drive, that will probably be fine. Although, even if you have drives organized by customer, having one huge Library for everything they've ever done probably isn't the best organization.
For example, I shot and edited a series of Enlightened Cook videos for my friend Yogi Marlon. If I'd kept them all on one drive, then 10.1 will create me one big library, that I would rename (see below). However, I'd prefer to have individual Libraries for each project: the Hollywood Farmers Market videos, for the redos, and for the the Thanksgiving Turkey shoot (with gravy). If you are like me, with a G-tech RAID that carries most of my ongoing work, then one big library, isn't going to be ideal. Of course you can create new Libraries and move Events and Projects between Libraries once you've upgraded, but doing that within Final Cut Pro X after upgrading is somewhat painful. 10.1 copies - rather than moves - Events or Projects between Libraries, so you have a bunch of cleanups to do. Further, all the Projects will be in an Updated Projects Event. There is no clue as to which Projects match up with which Events.
There is a better way using Event Manager X, which is why we made it free. Download now. Spread the word!
If you are upgrading a SAN location, refer to Apple's Help for Final Cut Pro X 10.1.
Upgrading the Better Way using Event Manager X
This method applies to internal or directly connected drives, which has always been the role for Event Manager X. If you do not already use Event Manager X, download it here.
Before running Final Cut Pro X the first time, follow these instructions.
1) Run Event Manager X.
2) Deselect all Events and Projects in the Event Manager X interface by choosing the “All Off” set from the Sets popup menu. Select the All Off set from the Sets menu.
3) Uncheck the “Re-open Final Cut Pro X” checkbox so Final Cut Pro X will not run.
4) Click “Move Events and Projects”. This moves all the Events and Projects on the drives to their respective Final Cut Pro Events - Hidden, and Final Cut Pro Projects - Hidden folders. (You could do this without Event Manager X but it's easier with it.)
Event Manager X interface with all Events and Projects hidden from Final Cut Pro X. All Events and Projects are now hidden from Final Cut Pro X ready for a controlled conversion to Libraries. You can see that I have multiple different projects here: from my Solar Odyssey footage, to some Lumberjack testing, to some Enlightened Cook videos for a friend. I do not want them all in the same Library, which is what Final Cut Pro X 10.1 would do by default.
For this example I want to create a Library for the Enlightened Cook Hollywood Farmers Market shoot and edits. Because I'm a long time user of Event Manager X, I use Sets to manage what I want to work on. These make it quick and easy for me to select a combination of Events and Projects in one step. An advantage for long time Event Manager X users.
5) I select the set and all related Events and Projects are selected. If you don't currently have sets, click the check boxes on for the Events and Projects you want to move to this new Library.
If you have existing Sets use them to manage the upgrade.
The Set instantly turns on related Events and Projects, but you can do it by clicking the checkboxes as well.
6) With the ‘Re-open Final Cut Pro X” checkbox clicked on, click on Move Events and Projects.
Click the checkbox on to open Final Cut Pro X when the Events and Projects have been moved
The selected Events will be moved to Final Cut Pro Events on the relevant drive: selected Projects will be moved to Final Cut Pro Projects on the relevant drive. This will be instantaneous and take no additional drive space. We are now ready to have Final Cut Pro X 10.1 upgrade this set of Events and Projects to a new Library. Final Cut Pro X will offer to upgrade your Events and Projects to a Library if this is your first time running 10.1, otherwise choose the File menu and select ‘Update Projects and Events' to bring up the Update dialog.
To get FCP X 10.1 to update a new selection of Events and Projects, select from the File menu.
You'll see this dialog the first time FCP X 10.1 "sees" a new drive, or select Update Projects and Events from the File menu.
7) Click the Update All button. Final Cut Pro X will give a progress bar as it updates the selected Events and Projects to the Library.
Most Updates will happen very quickly.
Final Cut Pro X will move media that is self contained within the Events, into the Library (while at the same time retaining a hard link to the original location so it seems like there are two copies, without using twice the hard drive space).
8) When the update is complete, decide what to do with the old Events or Projects.
Always take the conservative path and retain the Events and Projects.[/caption] I strongly recommend clicking Save to retain a copy of the original Events and Projects until you have confirmed that the Library has been correctly updated. I had no failures but caution is called for.
9) Rename your Library.
Rename the Library from the default to something that represents the content.
By default Final Cut Pro X will give it a name based on the hard drive name. Obviously you'll want to name it something appropriate. Click inside the name and type in the new name for the Library. You can see that I have the Lives of Style Library also loaded into Final Cut Pro X.
If you choose to Save the old Events and Projects (as I recommend you should, at least temporarily) then Final Cut Pro X will create an “Old” folder for the upgraded Events and Projects.
The Final Cut Event and Project folders are deleted after updating to a Library.
Final Cut Pro X will also delete the Final Cut Events and Final Cut Projects folder, as it considers that these are now obsolete. Event Manager X recreates them so that you can continue the controlled upgrade process with other combinations of Events and Projects.
Event Manager X recreates the missing folders so further updates can be done in a controlled manner.
10) Repeat for your other drives, or combinations of Events and Projects from this drive. You'll note that your Projects are contained in an Event called ‘Updated Projects'. Each Event will continue to be an Event and contain any Compound Clips previously in that Event.
Projects can be found in an Updated Projects Event within the Library.
11) Once you are satisfied that the Library has been updated successfully, delete the old Events and Projects. 12 Repeats from Step 5 for as many projects as you want to update.

Throughout Syrian neighborhoods, the bombardment does not stop. It is relentless in its power. And it spares nobody, regardless of age.
Rocket and mortar fire pelts the town and the people striving to defend themselves against what they say is a brutal regime.
Graphic videos showing the battle against Bashar al-Assad's regime paint a gruesome picture of life in the country as residents struggle to release themselves from the grasp of a ruler they say they no longer want. Activists claim the Syrian city of Homs is under heavy bombardment by government forces, a claim the regime denies.
But the footage is so raw, it's hard to look at - and hard not to look at. While many of the details in the videos cannot be independently verified by CNN, the images alone are still haunting.
A child with bloodied clothing lies in a hospital, unable to move because their legs have been blown off. Some videos show bodies in the streets. Blood flows down the faces of people who are said to be victims of the attacks.
The blood of Syrians continues to flow, as does their anger - at both the regime they claim is killing them and international powers that have yet to be able to help stem the bloodshed.
The violence ratcheted up again after Russia and China on Saturday vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution that would have demanded al-Assad stop the violence and seek a solution to the crisis.
Vetoes lead Syria to bloody stalemate
Many activists say they saw the vetoes as a green light for the Syrian regime to strengthen its crackdowns, though the government denies that.
After the vetoes, the U.S. and other governments said they would try other ways to pressure the Syrian government. On Tuesday, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the days of al-Assad's leadership "are numbered."
What is happening in Syria?
As the government sought to present an image of broad popular support on Tuesday after a day of brutal violence, opposition activists reported more deaths.
At least 21 people were killed Tuesday, including 15 in Homs, a 15-year-old just outside Homs and five in the Damascus suburb of Zabadani. At least 128 people were killed across the country Monday, mostly in Homs, according to the opposition Syrian Revolution General Commission.
"The situation is beyond description," the commission said in a statement. "Some of these martyrs were killed with shrapnel and the others were under the rubble, and their bodies couldn't be identified because they were in remains."
Mousab Azzawi of the Syrian Network for Human Rights said "the situation is very dire." Monday was almost "like a bloodbath," they said.
"We have pictures of children under the age of 14 with half of their faces blown away, with children under the age of 4 with all of their bodies with nail bombs. We have pictures of one child who was dying on the lap of their mother under the age of 1," Azzawi said.
Residents are trying to get the message out to media outlets around the globe that they are terrified of their government and of dying.

U.N. officials have estimated that 6,000 people have died since protests began nearly a year ago. The Local Coordination Committees, a network of opposition activists that organizes and documents protests, said that at least 7,339 people have been killed.
CNN cannot independently confirm opposition or government reports from Syria because the government has restricted journalists' access to the country. That means much of what we're seeing is an uprising being streamed on YouTube.
Mashable: World watches Syria's uprising on YouTube
While attempts at diplomacy have failed to curb the estimated thousands of deaths in the 11-month-old conflict, residents and opposition activists say they are desperate for help in stopping the slaughter.
Who is fighting, and what are they hoping for?
When Bashar al-Assad became president in 2000, they promised a modern Syria. Human Rights Watch has called their time as president "the wasted decade," with media that remain controlled by the state, a monitored and censored Internet, and prisons filled with dissidents.
Now, after claims of brutal crackdowns and undelivered promises, opposition supporters just want an end to their rule.
Who is al-Assad?
But it's not all that easy to figure out who is leading the charge against al-Assad.
Rival dissident army officers claim to lead the increasingly armed rebellion within Syria. The rift means it is unclear how much command the exiled officers have over defecting troops and other opposition groups.
During the more than 10 months since the uprising began, competing civilian exiles have also claimed leadership of the revolution.
Some Western diplomats working closely with opposition groups have privately expressed frustration with dissidents' lack of unity, even as the death toll continues to rise.
One thing is clear: Those who say they have been oppressed by the regime, who have been brutally beaten or who have seen friends die want to make sure they are doing what they can to end violence for other Syrians.

Those who attend nightly rallies in Damascus tell CNN's Arwa Damon that all they want is to be treated with dignity and respect, to voice their opinions without reprisal, to speak for the thousands killed, detained and tortured since the uprisings began in March.

And then there are some who feel like those at the rallies but are afraid of the turmoil and uncertainty, and so they remain caught in the middle.
On the streets of Syria, every day brings more reports of deaths. One disturbing video surfaced on YouTube purportedly showing several members of a slain family. In the video, the mother's eyes appeared to be gouged out. At least four children died with their parents. Opposition groups say the family was killed by government forces in Homs.
A rare glimpse inside protests in Syria
Such brutality isn't uncommon, according to a newly released report from Human Rights Watch.
"Syrian security forces have killed, arrested and tortured children in their homes, their schools or on the streets," said Lois Whitman, children's rights director at Human Rights Watch.
What are the politics?
Saturday's veto by U.N. Security Council members Russia and China of a draft resolution that would have demanded al-Assad stop the violence against the opposition has complicated international efforts to deal with the situation.
Russia and China said that although they support an end to the violence and want to promote dialogue between the Syrian government and the opposition, they believe the resolution would have been one-sided. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in particular said the draft would have called on the Syrian government to stop violence "without the same for the armed groups."
Western diplomats expressed amazement at the vetoes, saying the resolution was watered down to accommodate other Russian concerns. The resolution had dropped demands from an Arab League plan for Syria to form a unity government and for al-Assad to delegate power to their deputy. U.N. diplomats said this was done because Russia had been reluctant to sign on to any plan that could be seen as a mandate for regime change in Damascus.
Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said the United States was "disgusted" at the veto, and they said of Russia, "This intransigence is even more shameful when you consider that one of these members continues to deliver weapons to Assad."
Clinton: Vetoes a 'travesty' | Opinion: Why Russia protects Syria's al-Assad
Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers, and both Russia and China have various reasons to have friendly relations with Damascus, analysts in the United States said. The total value of Syrian contracts with the Russian defense industry probably exceeds $4 billion, according to Jeffrey Mankoff, an adjunct fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies Russia and Eurasia Program. Russia also leases a naval facility at the Syrian port of Tartus, giving the Russian navy its only direct access to the Mediterranean, Mankoff told CNN's Holly Yan.
And China was Syria's third-largest importer in 2010, according to data from the European Commission.
Why do China, Russia protect al-Assad?
Russia's Lavrov bristled at the veto criticisms, saying Western states "are trying to obscure the developments with hysterical statements on Russia's veto of the Syria resolution." China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "China does not shelter anyone. We uphold justice and take a responsible attitude. We want the Syrian people to be free from the scourge of conflict and warfare."
And Syria's U.N. ambassador accused some powers of giving support, "in terms of money, and arms, and favorable media coverage, to armed terrorist groups that kill, abduct, and intimidate Syrian citizens."

Nations that supported the resolution are now trying other ways to pressure the Syrian regime. The Gulf Cooperation Council - which includes the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait - announced Tuesday that its member states are pulling their ambassadors from Syria. Spain, France, the United Kingdom and Italy called home their ambassadors as well, and the United States closed its embassy in Damascus, saying Syria wasn't addressing its security concerns.
Mark Toner, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said that "by no means are we done here."
"We hear the people of Syria, and we want to move to support them. We've already got in place very strong sanctions, both bilaterally and multilaterally, and we're going to seek to take additional steps against the Assad regime," they said this week.
What happens now?
Syria's al-Assad has found a way to remain in power longer than many of the other leaders disposed of during the Arab protests, despite the growing protests against him.
Many leaders, including President Obama, have said it is time for al-Assad to step down. For many, it's a question of just how long they can hold out amid international pressure.
But for the residents dealing with the daily increasing violence, the situation boils down to just more than a waiting game.
They are exhausted from fighting, but will continue to do so even if it means more blood in the streets, they say.

For some, the call will be for the global powers to finally put an end to al-Assad or to help the people of Syria do it themselves, in a fashion similar to Libya and the downfall of late strongman Moammar Gadhafi.
Some want to see al-Assad fall at the hands of their own people.

Syria is on the brink of a civil war. And it could be a brutal one.
With the failure of U.N. action because of the veto, the conflict could escalate, wrote Shadi Hamid, a director of research at the Brookings Doha Center and a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, in a column for CNN.
“With that fateful decision, the conflict moved to another, more dangerous stage,” Hamid wrote. “Those who warn that Syria will descend into civil war are a bit behind: It is already in civil war. Now it will only intensify.”
Hamid said the next step may be deciding whether military intervention is necessary, and if so, by whom.
“So we find ourselves in an odd but increasingly common situation, where Syrians themselves are more enthusiastic about foreign military intervention than Americans are,” Hamid writes. “It is, in this sense, the reverse of Iraq, which was rightly seen by many as a tragic Western imposition.”
How much do we owe it to Syrians to step in and help drive the final nail into the coffin of al-Assad's regime? And would it be different than the situation in Iraq, because perhaps some of the people there would like the U.S. and others to step in?
“Here, it is Syrians themselves who are pleading for the international community to come to their aid. In December, the Syrian National Council "formally endorsed" foreign intervention,” Hamid wrote. “If they formally request military assistance - presumably the next step - we have a moral responsibility to take it seriously.”

Developed by Proxy Studios (www.proxy-studios.com), Pandora: First Contact is a science fiction 4X turn-based strategy game on a planetary scale.
In the future, factions have risen up from opportunities and ideologies independent of governments. Private corporations and religious movements have started wars over greed, ideology and power. Many have died and many lands lay in ruin. Planet Earth has been exhausted and colonial attempts on other planetary bodies have been in vain.
Finally, after decades of exploration, an interstellar probe has brought promise of a new world many light-years away. The most powerful factions have gathered their best men and women to send on a long journey to Pandora. Far from desolate, the earth-like planet has been found to host a plethora of indigenous life forms. While the gigantic monstrosities inland and at the oceans seem relatively calm, human-sized bugs and fungus are threatening to stop humankind's expansion.
As the various factions strive to take control, each will research and develop numerous new technologies, discovering new weapons and industry, whilst opening trade agreements and forging alliances with other factions to gain a foothold.
As they spread, they will discover ancient ruins and artifacts from alien civilizations that will grant them advantages over their rivals.
Pandora latest update also contains a whole new expansion
Ages ago an ancient civilization – the Messari – left Pandora to conquer other territories in the galaxy. Now this aggressive alien faction is back to recover its property and clean their planet from the Human invasion! In the later stage of the game, the Messari will land on Pandora and attack the stronger factions as a priority. Thanks to advanced weapons like tanks, gigantic mechs and motherships, they will change the balance of power on Pandora. They will also gradually try to infest the planet by changing the landscape and generate dangerous ion storms to make the environment even more hostile and merciless!
With Eclipse of Nashira, new dangers and opportunities enter the world of Pandora. A new faction shows its face, talking of peace and friendship while their spies operate behind enemy lines. Nothing is what it seems anymore, as agents conduct covert warfare of espionage and sabotage, inciting revolts and stealing technologies. Click here for the Eclipse of Nashira product page.

Queensland's highest court has rejected an appeal by conservation group, Coast and Country, challenging the approval of Gina Rinehart's Alpha Coal Project in Central Queensland'.
The decision, handed down by Queensland's Court of Appeal on Tuesday, is the latest in a string of regulatory and policy decisions made in favour of developing the Galilee Basin mega coal projects, among which the Alpha mine is expected to produce 30 million tonnes of coal a year.
The appeal, lodged by Coast and Country in October 2015 and heard in June 2016, argued a “specific legal case” about how the impacts in Queensland from the burning of coal from the mine should be assessed under Queensland law.
It followed up on a September 2015 Supreme Court decision that acknowledged emissions from the burning of coal were relevant in the assessment of coal mines in Queensland – a point that seems fairly obvious in light of the international effort Australia signed up to in Paris to limit global warming to 2°C at the uppermost.
“We opposed the approval of this mega-mine because it will contribute to dangerous global warming,” said Coast and Country's Derec Davies. “The coal from the Alpha mine will exacerbate harm to our natural ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef, which earlier this year suffered an unprecedented and devastating coral die-back caused by global warming.”
The court's three judges, however, found in favour of the mine developers, who argued – and were supported in their argument by the Queensland state government – that coal from other mines would replace the environmental damage of Alpha coal if it did not go ahead.
Jo-Anne Bragg, CEO of Environmental Defenders Office Queensland, who represented Coast and Country, said this was known as the ‘substitution argument', and was used by coal mines to avoid taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions.
“We said, as a matter of law, they are responsible for the consequences of their actions, regardless of what others may do,” Bragg said in a statement on Tuesday.
“We all know that burning fossil fuels is contributing to global warming, extreme weather events and severe damage to our Great Barrier Reef. Every further approval locks in those impacts.”
Bragg said that while they were disappointed in the decision, they planned to carefully read the judgement to examine the reasoning of the Court of Appeal.
“Today's court decision fails to overcome the nonsensical claim made by the Queensland government and GVK Hancock that there will be no decrease in global carbon emissions if the Alpha coal mine does not proceed because another mine will be developed somewhere else in the world to fill its place,” said Davies.
“The Alpha coal mine proposes to pump a massive 60 million tonnes of carbon pollution into our atmosphere each year. The mine's emissions exceed those of entire countries, including Finland, Norway and Ireland.
“Today's decision spells trouble for the Great Barrier Reef. Coast and Country will carefully review the decision and consider our options regarding an appeal,” Davies said.
Two prominent IWW campaigns have recently incorporated Thanksgiving into their strategy, recognizing that this is an incredibly profitable time for US capitalism, and a time when most US workers want to work less and spend time with people they care about.
Whole Foods workers in San Francisco declared their IWW membership and delivered demands to management on November 6. According to the story a group of 30 of them stopped work to come out as the union and deliver demands, including a $5/hour increase for all workers. As many current and former Whole Foods workers could tell you, this company micromanages and pushes it's work-hard ideology even stronger than most retail chains, so the work stoppage must have been incredibly empowering to those who took part.
Whole Foods responded with a $1.25 raise across San Francisco, which the workers are rightly taking credit for, but they also made clear that they would continue fighting for the full $5 raise. For context, a recent study estimated that workers in San Francisco need $29.83 to afford a one-bedroom apartment, which means the new starting wage of $12.75, while a gain, is still not enough. As the workers say, they want to earn enough to be able to quit their other two jobs.
The workers announced a 24-hour picket of the Northern California Distribution Center on November 21-22. That is where the majority of merchandise is delivered from, in one of their most profitable regions, during either their 1st or 2nd most profitable week of the year. We are still waiting to hear from them, but there is a lot of potential here to show the company that the union is strategic, intends to stick with its demands, and is willing and able to make this a serious economic issue.
~~~~~~~
While the Whole Foods workers have been focusing on raising the stakes with the company during it's super-profitable lead-up to Thanksgiving, our Fellow Workers at UPS are dealing with one of the give-backs that the Teamsters accepted in the recent contract. The contract used to provide the day after Thanksgiving as a holiday, but under pressure from Amazon and it's competitors who want to begin Black Friday on Thursday night, UPS successfully got this removed from the new contract.
The contract provides for double pay on the day, and a minimum of four hours (compared to an average shift of 2.5-3.5 hours for package sorters). Screw UPS, a newsletter by and for UPS workers, is right to point out that the company stands to make a killing on Black Friday, and if it can get away with it, will only ask for more next year. They are reminding workers to work as slowly as possible, and to stay as long as they can stand it to soak up the double pay.
The contract which gave back the day after Thanksgiving gave a lot more back too, and spawned a massive “Vote No” campaign, which the Teamsters leadership managed to defeat by telling the members to keep voting until they got it right. In that context our Fellow Workers are right to hammer home the ways that UPS workers are being squeezed harder and harder by the company, not to focus on criticizing the union or trying to reform it. As Farrell Dobbs, a former teamster, put it, the important thing is to get workers to aim at the bosses, and get the union bureaucrats in the crossfire. (He was writing in a time when more workers had to deal with union bureaucrats.)
At the last retail job I had where I was trying to organize, I got the sense that there is a palpable anger over the encroachment of Black Friday into Thanksgiving, an anger which is common to anyone working retail. Companies which pay time and a half end up around $15, which workers should be making anyways (at a minimum). We've seen that Our Walmart can get workers to congress to talk about the problems of retail workers at the holidays, but they haven't shown how workers can fight and win. A labor movement which would do that would have to wage effective strikes, which will probably mean strikes which go outside the law. The neo-liberal wing of the labor movement (SEIU, UNITE, UFCW) is ready to do anything to grow, except wage effective strikes.
A union movement which showed that it knew how to win back holidays, or use the pressure of holidays to gain significant wage gains, could inspire hundreds, maybe thousands of workers in the Bay Area alone. We are on the right path to do that. Will we know what to do afterwards?

Bryan Adams Mississippi Boycott Comes After Recent Egypt Show
Share On FacebookTweet Post
Bryan Adams Cancels Mississippi Show Over New Anti-Gay Law
Canadian Bryan Adams, the musician that loves 1969 probably more than any human alive, has joined Bruce Springsteen in cancelling a show over anti-gay laws that are creeping into the United States.
According to CBC, Bryan Adams was supposed to perform this week in Mississippi, but decided to nix the show, explaining their actions in a Facebook post.
“Mississippi has passed anti-LGBT ‘Religious Liberty' bill 1523. I find it incomprehensible that LGBT citizens are being discriminated against in the state of Mississippi. I cannot in good conscience perform in a State where certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation. Therefore i'm cancelling my 14 April show at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. Using my voice I stand in solidarity with all my LGBT friends to repeal this extremely discriminatory bill. Hopefully Mississippi will right itself and I can come back and perform for all of my many fans. I look forward to that day. – Bryan Adams ‪#‎stop1523″
Indeed, the stance is admirable and they have stood up for a good cause. They have also received a tremendous amount of praise on social media for their stance, becoming somewhat of a hero for LGBT rights in America.
I find it ironic that those who are denying service and rights to people who are gay are angry that Bryan Adams is canceling a concert. — Elaine T. Shaffer (@AUNTIELANELANE) April 11, 2016
@bryanadams +respect for cancelling the show for the hate-mongers. Keep up the awesome work! #equality #Respect — Dan Steiger (@RealFrozz) April 11, 2016
Mississippi's new law, which goes into effect on July 1, is absolutely draconian, putting religious “rights” above human rights and giving businesses and corporations the right to deny service to people because of their sexual orientation, and even “clears the way for employers to cite religion in determining workplace policies on dress code, grooming and bathroom and locker access,” as CBC states.
The Governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant, signed the bill into law in order “to protect sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions of individuals, organizations and private associations from discriminatory action by state government.”
Who in “good conscience” could possibly support this? It's fair to look at what is happening in Mississippi and want to protest this serious set-back when it comes to LGBT rights in the name of “religious freedom.”
Good Work, Bryan, But There Are A Few Questions To Be Asked
However, there is a small problem in the stance Bryan Adams is taking: Inconsistency and hypocrisy. This isn't to say that Bryan Adams is a terrible person who should be defined as nothing but a hypocrite and their actions in the case should be written off. They shouldn't be. Their contribution to the debate is positive and welcome. However, it also raises other questions that shouldn't be ignored.
Bryan Adams has performed all over the world, and some of the countries they have performed in like Qatar have anti-gay laws where people are actually thrown into jail for up to 3 years and/or can receive lashes. These laws came under a level of scrutiny when they were awarded the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but has largely gone ignored since.
It was only recently that Bryan Adams played a show in Egypt (and complained about their vintage guitar being damaged by customs officials there), a country where human rights abuses are frequent and where being gay has become a scary affair according to The Advocate as the current government cracks down on the LGBT community.
“Although homosexuality is technically not illegal in Egypt, LGBT people are regularly prosecuted for crimes such as “debauchery,” “perversion,” or “sexual practices against Islam.””
Where was their voice just a few weeks ago, speaking out for LGBT Egyptians? How was they able, in good conscience, to ignore the brutality being faced by the LGBT community there?
The question is, are the lives of gays in Mississippi more valuable than the lives of gays in Qatar or Egypt? To go onto a stage in a country where being gay can mean a lengthy prison sentence without saying a word, but making a stand on Mississippi sends a mixed message. Are LGBT lives less valuable when they are in Qatar? Or in Egypt?
When a “terrorist” attack happens in Europe or “The West” and there is an outpouring of grief and solidarity, the question is legitimately asked, “What about the solidarity and grief when it comes to attacks in the Middle East and Africa?”
So, the same question arises in this case. What about the solidarity and outrage about how gays are treated in a country like Qatar? These are people stuck under a theocratic, dictatorial regime punishing gays with jail time and brutality dictated by religion. Yet, outside few seem to want to speak out in support of them and their governments go without criticism. Why?
Bryan Adams has done right by not playing in Mississippi as did Bruce Springsteen when they chose not to play in North Carolina for similar reasons. But, when will more artists, actors and other prominent people start doing right when it comes to the abuses being faced by LGBT's in so many other countries in the world, those folks without voices, where no big stars are speaking out for them and showing solidarity? Gay lives matter, and they should matter everywhere.

More than 80 American athletes have sent medals they won at the Rio Olympics to U.S. Olympic Committee headquarters to be shipped to game organizers, who will replace them due to flaking, black spots and other damage, the USOC said Tuesday.
The Americans, including gold-medal wrestlers Kyle Snyder and Helen Maroulis, are among at least 100 Olympians from across the globe with defective medals.
Beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings is also among the group; they say their bronze medal is flaking and rusting, and USA Swimming spokesperson Scott Leightman said some swimmers have damaged medals as well.
The USOC learned about the problems in December and reached out to all the American sports federations in January to begin the process.
Rio Games spokesperson Mario Andrada said officials have noted problems with the covering on 6 to 7 percent of the medals.
“The most common issue is that they were dropped or mishandled, and the varnish has come off and they've rusted or gone black in the spot where they were damaged,” Andrada said.
It's not uncommon for medals to be passed around at post-Games parties and handled by hundreds. But this amount of damage is unusual.
Walsh Jennings, who won three golds in previous Olympics, says their medals tend to get beaten up because they don't hesitate to let people touch them or try them on. But they won't consider locking them up because people are inspired by them.
“They've offered to replace them. I'm not sure if I want to swap it out,” Walsh-Jennings told The Associated Press, adding the reason was “100 percent sentimental.”
USA Basketball spokesperson Craig Miller said the organization reached out to its players and seven — three men and four women — reported they believe there is an issue with their medals.
Snyder, who wrestles for Ohio State, was 20 when they won their medal. They noticed an issue with the award the day after they won it.
They went to a party at the Team USA house in Rio, where they said multiple people handled the medal as they celebrated. Snyder said they later discovered a scratch on the back of it, though they added there has been no further damage.
Snyder said they have until the end of the week to return their gold medal and has no idea when he'll receive their replacement.
“It wasn't too big of a deal,” Snyder said. “But since they're giving me a new one, it's kind of cool.”
Rio de Janeiro spent about $12 billion to organize the games, which were plagued by cost-cutting, poor attendance and reports of bribes and corruption linked to the building of some Olympic-related facilities.
Nine months later, many of the venues are empty and have no tenants or income — with the maintenance costs dumped on the federal government. In addition to the issues with the medals, which featured the Rio and Olympic logos, the local organizing committee still owes creditors about $30 million
Greg Massialas, a national coach for the U.S. fencing team in Rio, said in a message to AP that the silver medal their son, Alex, won is damage free. They added that they haven't heard about any issues with other American fencers.
U.S. shooter Ginny Thrasher and boxer Claressa Shields, along with men's tennis bronze medalist Kei Nishikori of Japan, also reported that their gold medals are intact.

Aurora's main business is in advancing the world of military aircraft, and has won several contracts from NASA and DARPA. Most famously, the company won funding to build phase two of the VTOL X-Plane -- beating out both Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The VTOL X-Plane (codenamed LightningStrike) promises to achieve top flight speeds of up to 400 knots with a more efficient hover and lift-to-drag ratio.
It's believed that Boeing will buy the company to help bolster its own expertise in autonomous aircraft and VTOL technology. It's likely that the bulk of that knowledge will be used to develop military vehicles, although we can hope that it will also trickle down to drone taxis and the like. It's not clear how deep Aurora's relationship with Uber went, or if that deal has ended now that Boeing is in charge.
The deal is structured so that Aurora will exist as an independent subsidiary under the Boeing brand, although without direct control. Although it's worth saying that the company will have access to the aerospace giant's vast R&D and financial resources.

The earliest they will attempt to pick up a baseball and initiate some throwing is at some point this weekend. But that is only if their symptoms allow it.

"David Price is initiating more strengthening exercises here today," said Farrell. "He continues to feel improvement. Friday/Saturday is still the time frame that we'll reassess to either put a ball in their hand at that point or maintain the rehab exercises. They feel better by the day. That's the update for right now."
The Red Sox won't have a timetable for Price to pitch in games until they resume throwing for a few days.
Worth noting
• Left-hander Drew Pomeranz and right-hander Steven Wright took the last step required for them to join the Grapefruit League rotation, pitching against each other in a simulated game on the main diamond at JetBlue Park.
Both hurlers threw two innings, facing Carlos Quentin, Cole Sturgeon, Mike Olt and Matt McLean. Pomeranz threw 35 pitches to catcher Blake Swihart. Wright threw 37 pitches to batterymate Sandy Leon. Wright missed most of the stretch run last season due to right shoulder bursitis. Pomeranz pitched through left forearm soreness. Both could pitch in a game as early as Monday. Barring any setbacks, they should both be ready for the start of the regular season.
• Hanley Ramirez hasn't been cleared to play defense yet due to their right shoulder injury, but Farrell doesn't think the slugger will need many reps to be ready to start at first base against lefties in the regular season. The alignment of Ramirez DHing against righties and playing first against lefties is key for Farrell regarding the usage of Chris Young.
"Hanley even has that confidence as well that with three and a half weeks to go, we're hopeful to see that throwing program begin to increase," Farrell said. "We need them to be on the field defensively for those games that we've talked about to get Chris Young in the lineup. Chris has been a very good contributor when he's been on the field for us. Their versatility and ability to play defense really works well with the rest of our roster."

The company is looking to raise up to $100 million in the deal, whose lead underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Allen & Co, according to Thursday's filing. The news comes three months after fellow New York company Blue Apron filed to go public.
In the six months that ended on July 31, MongoDB had a $45.76 million net loss on $67.99 million in revenue. Most of the revenue comes from subscriptions; the rest is from services.
The open-source MongoDB database picked up traction early on because it was seen as being easy to learn in comparison with more traditional databases.
The company cites enterprise software providers like IBM, Microsoft and Oracle as competitors. Plus, MongoDB said there are NoSQL database offerings available from public cloud infrastructure providers like Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft. MongoDB's own Atlas cloud database service runs atop the Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft's clouds.
"In addition, other large software and internet companies may seek to enter our market," MongoDB said.
The company had a post-money valuation of $1.6 billion as of January 2015, according to PitchBook data. Investors include Flybridge Capital, Sequoia Capital and Union Square Ventures. MongoDB had more than 4,300 customers, including more than half of the Global Fortune 100 companies, and 820 employees as of July 31, according to the filing.
Leadership Faramir is a mighty Hero, a vast improvement on their Lore counterpart. They show their quality in their ability to rally allies around him. In almost all cases this is a fairly beneficial effect, turning questing allies into questing and combat allies. In cases involving the Ents? This takes a great trait with only one main drawback into a force to be reckoned with. This is the Ents of Ithilien.
For some, this deck may not be new. When this brand new Faramir was introduced to the card pool many other blogs began to post decks that took Faramir's effect to full advantage (here is one on Hall of Beorn). It didn't take too much to see that the Ents would be one of the best allies to receive this boon. A list that showed up on The Warden of Arnor got me to give the deck a shot and you will see my deck came from their build with some minor changes as I played with it more and more. Please, if you have a moment, stop reading and give their article a look. It was very informative and again inspired me to try out this combination of cards. This deck is just my iteration of their list. With that out of the way, on to the Heroes!
This deck is about two things, readying our Ents and giving us a reward for engaging enemies. Faramir accomplishes both of these things. Outside of their effect their well rounded stats and their very solid 5 hitpoints will have them playing a defensive role early game and then an offensive one late game. Mablung appropriately joins Faramir and their band of Ents as well. Thanks to Mablung, every time we engage an enemy and ready an Ent we will also be gaining resources to help pay for future Ents! To keep up with all of these Ents dropping down on to the battlefield is Pippin (Lore). Their +1 to engagement costs is certainly a nice global effect but more importantly they reward us for engaging enemies by drawing us a card. Better yet, where Mablung and Faramir's abilities are once per phase Pippin's only stops when we stop engaging. They can fetch Ents that are hiding in the forest that is our deck and prepare them for battle!
Allies:
There are a lot of allies in this build, more than I have ever used I think. Thirty-three ally cards make up the deck, spread across fourteen different allies. Of those different allies, eight of them are Ents, representing twenty-one of the thirty-three total card count. Let's get the non-Ents out of the way.
This is a tri-sphere deck. It would seem almost wrong to not include 3 copies of Errand-Rider to guarantee my resources go where they need them to be. Late game these guys are perfect for chump blocking (if the quest doesn't punish such a strategy) and in the first quest of the Grey Haven Deluxe Expansion these little Gondorians are perfect for sailing tests. There are 3 copies of Dunedain Hunter as well which interestingly enough, acts as another reliable resource-focused card for us. On the first turn we can play Dunedain Hunter, pull an enemy from the encounter deck, grant us an extra resource, and allow us the chance to play some of our more high-costed allies (ideally a particular bearded Ent). In a less ideal, but still great, scenario the Dunedain Hunter can be used to ready a low costed Ent that was already put into play by activating Faramir's ability.
On a more supportive front are allies like Warden of Healing and Honour Guard which offer their own differing approaches to healing. Other than our Heroes, we actually don't mind our characters getting damaged and so these two work wonderfully in multiplayer games since they can focus on other players. Gandalf from the Core Set makes an appearance as well and they will be played in their usual “sneaky” way. Then there's a newcomer to this list in the form of Guardian of Arnor. This deck has its fair share of being able to deal with enemies but I was finding that I needed a nice wall of an ally that wasn't the 1-hitpoint Defender of Rammas. Guardian of Arnor works perfectly in that they scale with our side of the board as it gets a little more hectic. He'll be an average defender early game then have a couple rounds of some very amazing defensive capabilities, giving us the opportunity to clean things up with our Ents.
Speaking of Ents! I'm going to go over these rather quickly to keep this post from getting too lengthy. I'll start with Ents that are good for Questing and other aspects of the round outside of combat. Quickbeam, Wandering Ent, and Wellinghall Preserver are almost always committed to the quest while the Preserver grants some extra healing. In a more peaceful board state Beechbone can even commit to a quest when a large push is needed. Otherwise they will be used for combat. Worth noting, the Wellinghall Preserver is great for keeping the Derndingle Warriors (mentioned in the following paragraph) from over extending themselves.
On the combat front we have Beechbone, Skinbark, Booming Ent, and Derndingle Warrior. Skinbark and Beechbone (only 1 copy each) can be substituted for an extra copy of the other or removed entirely depending on the quest. They are there to get damaged, as is the Derndingle Warrior who also happens to be our other great defender outside of the Guardian of Arnor. All of this goes to help bolster our Booming Ent which when there are multiple copies out can do massive amounts of damage in one swing.
And finally there is Treebeard who deserves their own spotlight compared to the other Ents. Though they do cost 4 resources they are thankfully neutral and can start paying for other Ents as the game progresses, saving our Heroes' resources for other cards. They can act as a solid quester, attacker, or defender. I often use them as a defender so they can take a bit of damage and boost our Booming Ents up even higher. Games where they don't make an appearance, or games where they meet an easy demise, often prove to be more difficult. That is why there are three copies of them even though they are unique.
Attachments:
Let's do a complete 180-degree turns. There are only 3 attachments in this deck, all of them representing one card. That is Gondorian Shield a near auto include in a deck like this with easy access to tactics resources and two Gondorian Heroes, one of which has one of the highest HP totals seen in the game (for player cards). Granted, late game these cards are a bit useless and can be chucked for encounter card effects or to the likes of Eowyn, but early game they provide some extra defensive power while we wait for our Ents to come online.
Where this may be the decks key weakness it's also a great starting point to apply your own playstyle or to adjust to certain quests. I will post a lot more about this near the end when I go over sideboard options. For now, it's time for the events!
Events:
The events in this deck are a little more well-represented. There are fourteen cards spread across five different events. For tactics there are two copies of Boomed and Trumpeted and Feint. Feint, like the Gondorian Shield, helps us out in the early game but also works just as well in the late game especially when a mightier foe enters into the foray. Boomed and Trumpeted is more of a utility card and can ready an Ent when Faramir cannot. It can be a bit on the clunky side and doesn't always work as well as I'd expect. When an encounter card forces me to chuck something Boomed and Trumpeted is often the first. This is another area where some tweaking and sideboarding can be done in certain scenarios.
Lore, like tactics, also has two different events and both serve to thin out the deck. Entmoot, one of my favorite event cards which almost always hits its mark, pulls the Ents out of the deck and into our hand, leaving a more streamlined deck of cards. Side note, I personally enjoy pulling an Entmoot out of an Entmoot and then getting to play another Entmoot! Then there is Daeron's Runes. Though it doesn't grab as many cards as Entmoot it isn't as restrictive. If we draw an Ent then that's great. If we draw Gandalf, Warden of Healing, or Feint then we thankfully don't have to shuffle it back in like we would with Entmoot. Since there are so many copies of cards like Treebeard and Gondorian Shield its likely we may pull a duplicate with the runes and so it's discard effect doesn't sting as much as it might in other deck lists.
Lastly for leadership there's the trusty Sneak Attack. Plain and simple it is meant for Gandalf and to help us get what we need at the appropriate time. Since most of our allies come into play exhausted Sneak Attack can feel a bit clunky otherwise especially since the timing will usually be off and Faramir's effect will have already been triggered. However I have used it to sneak attack a Warden to get some last minute healing or an Errand-Rider to chump block so it's not entirely useless when Gandalf's missing.
Sideboard:
Most of my sideboarding will come in the form of attachments. Depending on your style or the particular quest you are playing then you may want to retweak some of the deck. If the ally count is too high but you're still itching for some Ents, then you can dwindle some of the 3 and 2 copy Ent for attachments like Dunedain Warning, Dunedain Mark or another card I've been thinking of Gondorian Fire. Fire takes advantage of the traits of two of our Heroes while the Warning and Signal make use of their resources. Mablung can easily gain them while there really isn't a big need for Leadership resources, which means Faramir usually sits on some extra. For Pippin you can throw in cards like Fast Hitch and Hobbit Cloak if you want to move them from just questing to questing/defending.
Conclusion:
I love this deck. It's been the one I play the most when I play solo/2-handed or when I'm out at my FLGS. The amount of damage it can put out can be laughable at times yet on the same hand it can do its fair share of questing especially late game. In an ally hating quest it will definitely have its struggles, so buyer beware of that one. The only thing I will say, and this may be due to my style of play when I'm piloting this deck, is that it does have the potential to overextend its reach. The early game is vital for this deck and if you lose an Ent early on or if you accidentally take on an enemy you can't handle it is hard to recover. Again, this is possibly due to my style since I like drawing cards and gaining resources which tends to lead to some greedy choices on my end but it's still worth noting.
Here you will find another link to the deck list that got me started on Ents/Faramir from the Warden of Arnor. Their list is titled “Hasten the Ents” and as you can see I didn't stray too far from their formula. If you didn't check it out when I mentioned it above I highly suggest giving it a look now 🙂
Let me know below what you think about this build and what you've done with Leadership Faramir in your lists if at all. Lastly, I want to point out that I built this deck using Seastan's new Love of Tales Deckbuilder which was based off the very useful Rivendell Councilroom. Its a very interesting next step for deckbuilders and this community and I encourage you to check it out!

The first thing you will notice is that slashing and stabbing attacks to the upper and lower body are actually effective (against unarmored opponents) and that stabbing someone really does kill them now.I would really suggest not trying to tank a hit,you will die,quickly.Likewise ,other enemies too!
Your hamlet slaughterfest will be much more enjoyable now that you can stab a peasant in the gut and watch them bleed to death while running for the horizon! Watch out for those boning knives though.Also:always try to wear armor.
Future versions may also up the pain values making enemies more susceptible to giving in to pain. Done,I included a version that makes the pain more as well as the increased bleeding.
Also:Trying to find a workaround for severed limbs not causing pain,though it's the same in vanilla DF so...
Oh yeah should probably include instructions:
Place in :Dwarf Fortress\raw\objects and overwrite when prompted.
Or alternatively you can put it in:\data\save\regionX\raw\objects to make it work with already generated worlds.

ITV commissions a third series of Broadchurch
David Tennant and Olivia Colman will return
The award winning and critically acclaimed drama, produced by Kudos and Imaginary Friends Productions, written and created by Chris Chibnall, has gripped the nation with two compelling series.
Series one saw the consequences of the tragic death of school boy Danny Latimer and the investigation into who killed him, with Joe Miller eventually revealed as the murderer.
The second series saw Joe Miller plead ‘Not Guilty' and the subsequent trial, while the family of Danny struggled to come to terms not only with their son's death but also the media spotlight and their desperation for justice to be done. DI Alec Hardy also remained determined to solve the Sandbrook case, and with DS Ellie Miller's help they finally learned the truth behind the death of Pippa Gillespie and the disappearance of Lisa Newbery. Both series of Broadchurch achieved a consolidated series average of over 9 million viewers.
David Tennant and Olivia Colman will reprise their roles as Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller for the third series. Details of other cast members, and filming dates, will be confirmed at a later date.
ITV's Director of Drama Steve November and Controller of Drama Victoria Fea have commissioned the new series which will be written by Chris Chibnall once again. The executive producer team will remain the same with Chris Chibnall alongside Jane Featherstone.
Steve November today said: “Chris Chibnall knows exactly how to keep viewers guessing and I'm delighted that they are going to take the story onto the next stage.”
US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley presented what they called “irrefutable” evidence that a Yemen-fired missile was of Iranian origin on Thursday, but there remains substantial speculation about what, if anything, they actually proved in the presentation.
Haley pushed the idea that the missile shown, apparently the one fired at the Riyadh airport by Yemeni forces, was provided by Iran, saying the UN had said this was the case. The UN, however, never made any such finding.
France was very clear about how skeptical they are of the Haley comments, noting that the UN has not drawn any conclusions themselves, and French officials are still working with very limited data regarding the allegations.
Haley's presentation was very light on specifics, and appeared to just echo Saudi Arabia's own allegations of the missile being from Iran. That the US finds the Saudi narrative convenient is unsurprising, as they're eager to move against Iran on any pretext. With Yemen insisting they made the missile themselves, however, the lack of evidence to the contrary is going to raise a lot of doubts.

When it comes to wireline broadband, most people have few good choices. Some only have one option; in many parts of the country, getting anything over 6Mbps requires a cable modem. Because of this, consumers largely accept what the ISPs dish out, but it's still worth taking an occasional look at the terms governing Internet service—some surprising, even shocking, nuggets are buried in all that fine print.
Take Time Warner Cable. The company's acceptable use policy (AUP) governing Internet access generally makes sense, even when it tends toward the overbroad—TWC subscribers are not allowed to "upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available any materials or content that violate or infringe on the rights or dignity of others," for instance.
The dignity of others? Who knew that offending someone could be grounds for having your Internet access terminated? If you're the kind of person who spends weeknights photochopping Hitler mustaches onto portraits of Bush or drawing up offensive Obama-as-witch-doctor cartoons, you probably don't want TWC as your Internet provider.
The same goes if you work from home on occasion or write freelance articles for your local newspaper or start a nonprofit in your garage. "Unless you have specifically subscribed for commercial grade service, the ISP Service is provided to you for personal, noncommercial use only. The service cannot be used for any enterprise purpose whatsoever whether or not the enterprise is directed toward making a profit."
But most surprising is TWC's traffic management policy. Network management "may include detecting malicious traffic patterns and preventing the distribution of viruses or other malicious code, limiting the number of peer-to-peer sessions a user can conduct at the same time, limiting the aggregate bandwidth available for certain usage protocols such as peer-to-peer and newsgroups and such other Network Management Tools as Operator may from time to time determine appropriate."
That's unusually direct for this type of document, and it's doubly unusual given that Comcast recently concluded a multiyear fight with the FCC over the exact techniques at issue here—limiting P2P bandwidth by controlling the number of simultaneous sessions.
It's also a direct attack on anything resembling network neutrality. TWC reserves the right to discriminate against protocols it doesn't like, limiting their bandwidth while leaving other protocols untouched.
Given all the controversy over the entire issue during the last two years, we were quite surprised to find such a direct statement in the company's AUP, and we checked in to see if the company is actually making use of this provision.
"While our acceptable use policy does inform subscribers that we might use protocol specific bandwidth limitations, we are not doing so at this time," said TWC spokesperson Jeff Simmermon.
Many of these terms of service will never be used to harass subscribers. In fact, if you ask big copyright holders, they will tell you that ISPs turn a blind eye to all sorts of illegal behavior, like illicit file-sharing, because their subscribers engage in it so heavily.
Still, it's worth knowing what your ISP says you can do on (and with) the Internet and what it can do to stop you from doing it. Unless you read the fine print (and it's in multiple places, including the 5,800-word Terms of Service), you might not know that any WiFi access point must use a password or MAC address filter, and that "you cannot settle amounts you owe us by writing 'paid in full' or any other message on your bill or check."
And you might not know that TWC could ratchet down any specific protocol at any time.
Turkish military says 25 militants have died in Şırnak province as president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vows to ‘annihilate' PKK
Gunfire clattered constantly and smoke rose from two towns in south-east Turkey as the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Kurdish militants would be “annihilated” in an intensifying urban battle that has killed 25 fighters in two days.
The three-decades-old insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers' Party flared up again in July after the collapse of a ceasefire that had lasted two years, plunging Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east back into open conflict.
Twenty-four PKK militants were killed in Cizre and one in Silopi in the latest operations, the Turkish military said in a statement. Eight members of the security forces suffered wounds that were not life threatening.
The two towns, in Şırnak province near the border with Syria and Iraq, have become central targets for the latest anti-PKK operations in which Turkey's media says 10,000 police and troops, backed by tanks, are taking part.
The battle for Turkey: can Selahattin Demirtas pull the country back from the brink of civil war? | Christopher de Bellaigue Read more
Erdoğan said the operations would continue until the area was “cleansed” of the militants and their barricades and trenches destroyed.
“You will be annihilated in those houses, those buildings, those ditches which you have dug,” they told a crowd in Konya. “Our security forces will continue this fight until it has been completely cleansed and a peaceful atmosphere established.”
Machine gun bursts echoed across Cizre on Thursday and smoke funnelled up from the town, overlooked by armoured vehicles parked on hills, after a spate of blasts and shooting overnight, with tracer fire lighting up the sky.
“Through resistance we will win”, Kurds could be heard chanting in Cizre, while others shouted, whistled and banged saucepans, and children kicked store shutters in the darkened streets in a protest against the operations. Witnesses said there were similar scenes in Silopi overnight.
A 45-year-old mother of four, named as Hediye Sen, was killed during clashes in Cizre, while a 70-year-old died of a heart attack during fighting in Silopi, according to hospital sources.
The PKK launched its insurgency in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Peace talks between its jailed leader, Abdullah Öcalan, and the Turkish state ground to a halt early this year. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU.
A worker stripped down a circuit board at a recycling company in Berlin. Computers, among other devices, depend on some of Earth's rarest metals.
In “Rare: The High-Stakes Race to Satisfy Our Need for the Scarcest Metals on Earth,” chemist and author Keith Veronese introduces us to an obscure element called promethium, which, they write, “could be used to power atomic batteries that would continue to work for decades at a time.”
This would be a wonderful discovery but for one small problem: If we were to scour every single inch of the planet looking for this source of energy, we'd end up with about a pound of the stuff. Indeed, as marvelous as its powers are, promethium is so rare that we haven't developed a dependency on it. The same cannot be said of samarium, gadolinium, lanthanum, or other rare metals that, almost without our noticing, have become indispensable to modern life.
The soaring demand for the metals described in “Rare” is a product of the digital age. There is, in fact, hardly a new technology in use that doesn't rely on these elements. The capacitors in your smartphone are made of tantalum; the magnets inside your headphones contain neodymium; erbium is used to coat fiber optic cables; europium is responsible for the vivid colors on your flatscreen TV.

“Our future technology and way of life hinges on these metals,” Veronese writes. This would be perfectly fine if these metals weren't scattered across the world in minuscule quantities, often in a form that requires complex, costly, and time-consuming extraction procedures. Gaining a few grams of a rare metal from a couple of tons of rock can take months or even years.

While there's no reliable way to gauge how much of this stuff we have left, we can at least be sure of one thing: Supplies of the elements that drive our iPads, missile systems, and Xboxes are going to run out. “It's not going to be possible,” Veronese says, “to keep the game going forever.”
Veronese spoke to Ideas by phone from their home in Birmingham, Ala., about these rare metals, the political implications of our quest for them, and where we might turn next. Here, in Veronese's own words, is what we learned.
Exotic metals in your pocket
There are 17 rare earth metals, plus a handful of scarce metals in high demand. It's likely you've never heard of most of them, but you come into contact with them every day. Computers, rechargeable batteries, hybrid automobiles, GPS systems, gaming devices—pretty much every technology you use is going to involve at least one of these elements.
Even familiar metals have been put to unfamiliar uses. Platinum is an interesting example. In a catalytic converter, it takes carbon monoxide and breaks it down into harmless substances like water. It's used in a miracle drug for cancer. It's been employed in certain types of breast implants. It's a simple molecule that has a ton of uses.

We've known about many of these metals since the 1800s, but until recently we didn't have the means—or the need—to extract them. One major motivating factor was the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union went looking for the next big weapon. Military applications still play a central role. Beryllium, while not strictly a rare earth metal, is difficult to find and highly prized, mainly because it's used in next-generation fighter jets. Keeping up a supply of that is a hot-button issue right now.
The China syndrome
Nelson Ching/Bloomberg via Getty Images/file 2010 Technicians at the production facility of Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China.
In the past, the metals used by humans were difficult to extract but relatively abundant. These newer ones are so scarce, our access so tenuous, it's kind of frightening. Rare earth metals drive technological progress. It's not that we wouldn't have technology without them, but we'd have to take a step back. I don't think any of us would be too excited about returning to the age of fax machines.
The world's richest source of rare earth metals is China's Bayan Obo Mining District. In the 1990s, the Chinese government did a very smart thing: They started putting out an enormous amount of these metals at very low prices, which made mining them so unprofitable that other operations just closed down. So while China has about a third of the world's supply, its market share is 97 percent.
The pressing question is, could China withhold these metals for political purposes? It hasn't yet, but the fact that it could freak a lot of people out. The fear of being cut off is there—it's a form of political capital. For sure, it's made the United States sit up and listen. I don't think the quest to secure these resources will result in wars, but it seems likely there will be political conflicts.
Where to dig next
Victor Habbick/Visuals Unlimited Inc./Getty An illustration of a hypothetical asteroid mining operation in space.
There are other sources of rare earth metals. Parts of Central Africa have large deposits of tantalum, but the conflicts in that region have made it hard to get the metals out, and when they have, they've often been used to fund rebel groups. Afghanistan is sitting on potentially trillions of dollars in resources. You hope that country doesn't fall into the same trap.

In terms of new sources, there has been talk of sucking or dredging rare metals from the ocean floor, which is worrying. In 2013, Greenland voted to overturn a mining ban on uranium, which is often found while extracting rare metals, so that's a promising prospect.
There's a possibility we may start mining on the moon in our lifetime—though, besides the practical difficulties, there are even bigger political ones. Who owns the moon? Politically, asteroids would be easier. There are so many of them out there, it's less likely anyone will fight over them. And they're likely to be a lot more fertile, in terms of the metals they contain.
Of course, we have to be careful. We've all seen “Armageddon”; we know what can happen when you start meddling with asteroids. But we don't have to worry about that yet. We're going to need a few technological advancements before we start mining in outer space.

A confrontation broke out between security personnel from the American consulate and settlers from the Adei Ad outpost in the West Bank on Friday, after settlers hurled stones at two vehicles from the consulate. According to both Palestinian and settler sources, the American security guards drew their weapons at the settlers.
Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter
A preliminary police investigation of the clashes between American security personnel and Israeli settlers discovered the consulate employees had arrived at the Adei Ad outpost in Samaria without coordination with the appropriate defense officials.
An official from the village of Turmus Ayya, near the scene of the incident, said they invited the US delegation to examine thousands of olive tree seedlings which were uprooted on Thursday night – some belonging to Palestinians from the village who hold American citizenship. According to police, the settlers pelted the convoy with rocks, but neither side used their firearms.

A village official told Ynet that the American delegation, composed of employees from the Jerusalem consulate, arrived to the location after the property-owners asked them to examine the incident with their own eyes. The consul-general was not part of the delegation.
According to the Palestinians, an American vehicle with guards arrived at the agricultural lands to examine the scene and rule out any security risks, while the delegation members waited behind in the village. The settlers claimed the Americans arrived to the area without coordination and brought Palestinians into their territory, saying the American visit was coordinated with the Israeli Civil Administration for next week.
Sources familiar with the settlers said two American consulate vehicles pulled up on the southern side of the outpost. Following a report that was shared by the residents, armed men were deployed from the outpost, just as the US representatives were leaving the area.
Meanwhile, a clash between residents and the Americans developed, during which the Americans unholstered an M16 and a sidearm. The American delegation's visit was cancelled after the incident.
The US has not responded to the incident.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has been increasingly sidelined during meetings and cut off from their once-regular access to the Oval Office as chief of staff John Kelly has moved to impose greater order on the West Wing.
But Navarro, a hard-liner on trade who has clashed with their more moderate colleagues, still has an ace up their sleeve when it comes to shaping policy — their close connection with President Donald Trump himself.
Story Continued Below
Navarro's reputation as a trade warrior has so ingratiated them with Trump that when other administration officials initially cut Navarro out of trade negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago in April, the president insisted that they be by their side, asking “Where's my Peter? Where's my Peter?” according to a former White House official.
Now, Navarro's pull with the president — and Kelly's ability to contain the trade adviser's freewheeling style — will be put to the test as Trump makes crucial decisions on everything from the North American Free Trade Agreement and a free trade deal with South Korea to whether to impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum and solar panels.
Navarro “reinforces Trump's worldview on trade, which many do not,” said Trump friend Roger Stone. “The president may be the only one in the building besides Navarro who really wants to renegotiate NAFTA. Everyone else thinks that's a throwaway line from a campaign speech.”

Trump's more moderate advisers have succeeded repeatedly in persuading the president to rethink their protectionist instincts. At one point, Trump seemed ready to slap tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from the South Korea trade deal — two top priorities for Navarro and their allies. Other aides interceded, successfully arguing that Trump should rely on the administration's internal policy review process before making a rash decision, especially amid escalating tensions with North Korea.
Trump is increasingly eager to flex their muscles on trade, according to White House aides and outside advisers to the president, who added that the president is sometimes resentful of those who recommend a more measured approach to the issue. And, the advisers said, Kelly's efforts to impose order on the West Wing have isolated the president — leaving Trump increasingly frustrated and unpredictable.
“I get the sense that the president is tired of being told that they can't do X,Y or Z in the trade space,” said one White House official. “I think he's lost patience with it. I don't see how the free-trade camp in the West Wing can continue to put the brakes on this stuff. I think they're going to have to choose what they want to prioritize.”

But one prominent D.C. lobbyist with close ties to the White House said Navarro has been largely shunned by other White House aides.
“No one gives a damn what they say other than Trump,” the lobbyist said. “With Bannon gone, they look at their watch when they talk.”
Navarro is the most vocal trade hawk in the White House, though Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have also often taken more hard-line stances on trade, as did former strategist Steve Bannon before their departure in August, officials said.
“Navarro has always viewed themselves as the lone man on the island, the one true keeper of the flame. That's been the dynamic with them since Day One,” one administration official said, disputing that Navarro is isolated in the White House. “But when you look at the substance of the possible trade policy actions, Ross and Lighthizer are reasonably closely aligned with Navarro on many issues. Usually, Peter just puts it more forcefully and emphatically.”
From the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Navarro leads the White House Trade Council, but he's largely a one-man band, with only two staffers. Prior to Kelly's entry, Navarro enjoyed a private 15-minute conversation with Trump at least once a week, where they would “rile them up” on trade, according to a senior administration official.
As a deputy assistant to the president, he's lost access to some key policy meetings in the White House that under Kelly are now reserved for principals or key senior staffers.
“There's certainly no effort to keep Peter out of meetings,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “The distinction isn't that they don't have access. He's presenting their case, both parties are walking through the policy together, and meetings are taking place and some of those conversations are being thought through more thoroughly before they go to the president, so it's not a debate in front of the president, but more a laying out of the vision.”
“The president has never been shy that it's an America-first policy when it comes to trade,” Sanders added. Navarro did not respond to a request for comment.
Navarro still attends weekly trade meetings organized by staff secretary Rob Porter, which gives them an opportunity to influence key policy outcomes. The meetings, which have been taking place in private for months, often feature the administration's heaviest hitters on trade, including National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Ross and Lighthizer.
The former White House aide described those meetings as “brutal,” full of verbal arrows being thrown between Cohn and other members of the National Economic Council on one side and Navarro, Bannon, Lighthizer, policy adviser Stephen Miller and — sometimes — Trump on the other.
Cohn and Navarro have often clashed behind the scenes. Benjamin Levine, an Obama-appointed economic adviser who stayed in the White House until May, said that Cohn is often the first person to shut down Navarro's ideas for withdrawing the U.S. from international trade deals.
“He's the stopgap to the crazy ideas,” Levine said. “It's the dance that Gary has learned.”
Cohn has advocated for a more traditional U.S. trade model, one that preserves existing trade deals. They scored two trade policy victories by helping to persuade Trump in April to renegotiate NAFTA instead of pulling out and not to name China a currency manipulator.
Navarro was brought on to Trump's team by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. Navarro became an ideological bedfellow to Trump and Bannon, advising the campaign on Canadian lumber tariffs and the finer points of NAFTA.
But with little political experience, they failed to build allies in the White House outside of Bannon, Miller and, occasionally, Lighthizer and Ross.
They pushed Trump to withdraw from NAFTA, reportedly prompting Kushner to open a back channel to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who persuaded Trump to renegotiate the deal rather than scrap it altogether. Navarro suffered their latest policy loss last week when Kelly and national security adviser H.R. McMaster prevailed on Trump to leave the South Korea trade deal intact.
Some White House aides saw two recent leaks — one over Trump's plans to pull out of the South Korea trade deal and another over Trump's private rant in favor of tariffs — as the work of administration advisers who want a tougher approach to trade.
A different administration official decried both stories as “strategic leaks” aimed at forcing Trump's hand, arguing it undermines the careful policymaking process Kelly is trying to put in place.
Navarro has told people that he's “miserable” under Kelly and is worried about how long he'll last.
But while they may have less influence, there hasn't been any real effort to remove them from their post — yet.
“He can last forever if they just sits there in their office and continues to write papers,” said a person close to the White House.

Also, it's totally pointless to seek equality with men in other fields or address sexism there. You will never be equal as an award-winning novelist, for example. If you're not in a STEM field, you fail feminism forever.
I second finding the leader and wearing their pelt though.

In 1960, only 10% of children were raised without a father in the home.
Today, 40% are.
There are many reasons behind this sobering statistic. The clichéd case of a man knocking up a woman, and then leaving town never to return certainly still occurs.
But sometimes a man's ex-wife petitions for primary custody of their kids, and sympathetic family courts unjustly grant this request about 80% of the time.
And there is an increasing number of women — who for various reasons cannot or do not want to raise their children with a boyfriend or husband — who intentionally choose to become single mothers.
It seems like more and more folks feel that dads are optional and that single moms can do just fine raise children on their own. Just over half of births among Millennials are to unwed mothers, significantly more than past generations, including Gen X. And only about half of Millennials believe a child needs a home with both a father and a mother present to grow up happily.
Yet despite the trend in popular culture towards greater acceptance of single motherhood, study after study empirically demonstrates that dads play an extremely important role in a child's well-being and success. Below we list a few studies that show exactly how much fathers influence their children's lives.
Children With Fathers Are Less Likely to Live in Poverty
Statistics suggest that children in father-absent homes are more likely to be poor. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 44% of children in mother-only families were living in poverty, compared to only 12% of children living in a household headed by a married couple.
The U.S. Department of Health has reported similar statistics that connect absent fathers with poverty. In a 2012 report, they found that children living in female-headed households with no spouse present had a poverty rate of 47.6%, over 4 times the rate of married-couple families.
Children With Fathers Do Better in School
A 2001 study by the Department of Education showed that students whose fathers were highly involved at school were 43% more likely to receive A's. This was true for fathers in biological parent families, for stepfathers, and for fathers heading single-parent families.
On the flip side, students living in father-absent homes were twice as likely to repeat a grade as students with a father in the home.
A concern that many educators have about boys is that they don't enjoy reading. But dads can help here too. One study reports that when fathers read recreationally, their sons read more and scored higher than did boys whose fathers did little or no recreational reading.
Children Without Fathers Are More Likely to Do Jail Time
Youths in father-absent households have significantly higher odds of incarceration than those in mother/father families. This was even true after controlling for different income levels. Young people who never had a father in the household experienced the highest odds of doing jail time.
The Department of Justice surveyed 7,000 inmates in 2002 and found that 39% of them lived in a mother-only household before being locked-up. In a similar study that surveyed nearly 14,000 female inmates, more than half grew up in a single-mother household.
Children With Fathers Are Less Likely to Abuse Drugs and Alcohol
A report in the Journal of Marriage and Family showed that even after controlling for community context, there is significantly more drug use among children who live in father-absent homes.
In another survey of 228 boys, those from single-mother homes reported higher rates of drinking and smoking as well as higher scores on delinquency and aggression tests when compared to boys from father/mother households.
Children Without Fathers Are More Likely to Be Sexually Active as Teenagers
A recent study showed that involved dads have twice the influence as moms on reducing teen sex.
Another study that pooled teenagers from the U.S. and New Zealand found that children without fathers were twice as likely to be involved in early sexual activity and seven times more likely to get pregnant as adolescents.
Children Without Fathers Are More Likely to Be Obese
Children in father-absent homes have a higher risk of becoming obese and suffer all the health risks that come with excess weight.
But even if dad is around, it doesn't necessarily mean their kids will be fit. In fact, several studies report that fathers have the biggest impact on the overall fitness and weight of their children.
In one, it was found that the father's, not the mother's, total and percentage body fat was the best predictor of whether or not the couple's daughters gained weight as they got older.
Another study showed fathers' (again, not the mothers') body mass index is directly related to a child's activity level.
Children With Fathers Get More Roughhousing (And Roughhousing Makes Kids Awesome)
Cross-cultural studies have found that the one thing fathers across the world have in common is that they roughhouse with their kids more than moms. And roughhousing, according to science, makes kids awesome. As we highlighted in a previous post, roughhousing makes kids resilient, smart, moral, and socially adept.
Children With Fathers Are More Likely to Have a Larger Vocabulary
When it comes to a child's verbal development, the popular belief is that the mother plays the most important role because, well, women are usually with their children more and women are supposed to be more verbal than men.
As Paul Raeburn highlights in their book Do Fathers Matter?, recent research suggests that dads actually play just as an important, if not more important, role in the verbal fluency of their children. Professor Lynne Vernon-Feagans and their team conducted a study to measure parental influence on early childhood verbal development. The surprising result from this study was that fathers, not mothers, had much more of an influence on a child's verbal adeptness.
Vernon-Feagans hypothesizes the reason dads have more of an influence on a child's verbal development is that because fathers frequently don't spend as much time with children, they're not as attuned to their current verbal development as mothers. Consequently, while mothers will use words that the child is familiar with, fathers will use unfamiliar words, thus helping the child broaden their vocabulary and learn new concepts.
Children With Fathers Are More Likely to Be Encouraged to Take Healthy Risks
While mothers tend to focus on their child's safety and well-being, dads are more likely to encourage risk and independent thinking in their children which will benefit them well into adulthood. As family and marriage researcher Professor Brad Wilcox has noted, researchers have found that dads are more likely than moms to encourage their kids to talk to strangers, take on challenges, and to think for themselves.
Children With Fathers Gain Many Additional Benefits to Health and Happiness
The Grant Study, the longest longitudal study ever done on the lives of men, found that a man's father influenced their life in many ways exclusive to their relationship with their mother. Loving fathers imparted to their sons:
enhanced capacity to play
more enjoyment of vacations
greater likelihood of being able to use humor as a healthy coping mechanism
better adjustment to, and contentment with, life after retirement
less anxiety and fewer physical and mental symptoms under stress in young adulthood
In the negative column, it “was not the men with poor mothering but the ones with poor fathering who were significantly more likely to have poor marriages over their lifetimes.” Men who lacked a positive relationship with their fathers were also “much more likely to call themselves pessimists and to report having trouble letting others get close.”
If there was ever any doubt, fathers matter, a lot: When all is said and done, a man's relationship with their father very significantly predicted their overall life satisfaction at age 75 — “a variable not even suggestively associated with the maternal relationship.”
Conclusion
I know that sometimes parenting can be discouraging. You might think that you really don't have much of an influence on your kids. I hope these studies and reports have shown you otherwise. Your role as a dad is immensely important. So focus on being the best dad you can be. It's not enough to just be there. Read to your kids. Get involved at their school. Roughhouse. Encourage them to take risks. Stay fit. These small things have a huge return on investment for the well-being of your children.
If you fathered a kid, but haven't had much of a role in their or their life for whatever reason, I challenge you to step up and embrace your role as a dad to the greatest extent you can. Yeah, it's going to be hard, and yeah, it's not always going to be fun, but it's your responsibility. And being a man means doing your duty.
If you're a single mom, not by choice, these studies may seem discouraging. But rather than being so, let them be an encouragement to make sure your children are influenced by male mentors — be they uncles, brothers, coaches, Boy Scout leaders, and the like.
And if you're a mom going through a divorce, know that while it's natural to want your kids as much as possible, if your husband is a good guy (through an objective lens, not through the lens of the acrimony created by your split), it's ultimately in your children's best interest to share custody equally.
Dads everywhere have the opportunity to leave a big impact on the world. Don't underestimate your influence on the lives of your children.
A Step In the Right Direction
On Dec. 21, Iraq formed a new government under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. One might be tempted to say that after nine months of jockeying for position between the various factions and parties, it was high time. But looking back at all that has transpired since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the fact that Iraq's freely elected parliament has sworn in a new Iraqi cabinet is indeed a remarkable achievement.
This is the fifth government this beleaguered country has had in slightly less than eight years. First, there was the occupation authority assisted by an Iraqi Governing Council; that was followed by an interim government, then a transitional government, and finally two successive governments led by Maliki. Interspersed between the last three governments have been three general elections and a national referendum to adopt a new constitution.
The situation in Iraq could have been much worse. The three successive elections since 2005 could have been marred by violence and fraud, but they were in fact both peaceful and free from tampering. Iraq could have plunged into full-fledged civil war in the wake of the sectarian violence that occurred in 2006; instead it pulled back from the brink and continued on the path of democratic development first laid out by the Coalition Provisional Authority and later by the new Iraqi Constitution. Instead of deciding who governs through the barrel of a gun, the people of Iraq have largely resolved this question through peaceful, democratic means.
The government that will soon be coming to power is a coalition comprising the country's major factions, including both Sunni and Shiite blocs in parliament. This does not by any means guarantee Iraq's peaceful, democratic, and prosperous future. But it does mean the country has a chance to attain a freer and better life than anyone had reason to expect a decade ago.
Important tasks lie ahead. Foremost among them is the nurturing of a spirit of communal tolerance and understanding that can help ensure political disputes aren't resolved by violence. Another related challenge is the continued strengthening of Iraq's national institutions, including the Army and the police force. When I arrived in 2004, there was one battalion in the entire Iraqi Army. Today, there are about 200. In total, Iraqi security forces now number roughly 500,000 people, and their capabilities are steadily improving. Their consolidation and professionalization should continue on a strictly nonpartisan, nonsectarian basis.
As Iraq's basic political and security institutions grow in stability, confidence, and stature, they will be better able to work on achieving sustained economic growth, which has suffered from the instability of recent years. Iraq is far from realizing its economic potential: Trade and investment languish, while the oil sector is but a fraction of full potential. Now that some of the most difficult political and security obstacles have been hurdled, it would not be surprising to see the people and government of Iraq turn more attention to developing and carrying out an economic growth agenda that is long overdue. This would benefit not only the Iraqi nation itself but also the international community as a whole. Although the U.S. military profile in Iraq will likely end in December 2011, America's interest in a peaceful and prosperous Iraq will no doubt endure long beyond that time. And having a functioning, if imperfect, government is a step in the right direction.
More than a decade after the demise of supersonic Concorde jets, the drive for easy and affordable access to space has inspired proposals for a new generation of superfast airliners able to streak across continents in minutes.
Recent advances in propulsion and spacecraft design—featuring lower-cost, reusable boosters and capsules—are transforming the way commercial and military entities view orbital missions. Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX), Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic LLC, and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC are among the private companies developing space vehicles designed to launch multiple times with scant refurbishment.
Public references to Pentagon research, some classified, that describe how this new space technology could be used for spy planes, or to rapidly replace national-security satellites destroyed in a conflict, also have helped fuel talk of using similar concepts to revolutionize air travel.
Now, despite daunting technical and cost challenges, some entrepreneurs are betting they can do it.
By incorporating innovative engine designs, the benefits of 3-D printing and principles of using the same booster repeatedly, these entrepreneurs plan to transform commercial aircraft into so-called hypersonic space planes capable of carrying passengers. Powered by engines that burn hydrogen fuel with oxygen from the atmosphere, but without the piping and moving parts essential for today's rockets, they would travel at least five times the speed of sound, or about 3,500 miles an hour, versus the 500 mph or so at which conventional jetliners typically cruise.
Among those championing hypersonic travel for fare-paying passengers is Chris Milam, a Texas real-estate developer and technology investor who has pledged to invest as much as $20 million of their own funds over the next few years to design such a system. Along with Preston Carter, an expert formerly with the Pentagon's advanced-research arm, Milam aims to develop a two-stage concept in which a rocket carries a hypersonic, winged vehicle and releases it to cruise at high altitude. The passenger-carrying craft would land at its destination like a conventional airliner.
“There has been lots of discussion about high-speed flight since the end of Concorde, but little has been realized,” Milam says. “The reality is systems like this are expensive.”
Preliminary designs call for the space plane to carry about 100 passengers and cruise at an altitude of 70,000 to 100,000 feet, with the goal of reaching any point on Earth within four hours. It would have a total takeoff weight of some 500,000 pounds, less than half of a fully loaded Airbus AIR, -0.19% A380 superjumbo.
The upshot, proponents argue, would provide options far beyond those promised by most of today's civilian supersonic projects, which remain focused on building business jets or mini-airliners that essentially are updated versions of the Concorde on steroids. Closely held Boom Technology Inc., for example, is developing a three-engine, 45-passenger jet intended to fly 1,500 miles an hour—or roughly twice the speed of sound.
But if an entirely new category of airliner-like suborbital vehicles becomes reality in coming decades, they would fly many times faster and higher, traveling from London to New York in some 40 minutes—or 10 times as fast as current airline schedules. That is still less than the anticipated top speed of the Pentagon's unmanned XS-1 experimental craft being developed to launch satellites (the Pentagon approved the design a month ago), or NASA's earlier X-43 rocket ship demonstrator that hit a record-breaking velocity of more than 7,500 miles an hour without a pilot.
For a hypersonic passenger jet to become a reality, some major hurdles need to be cleared. The biggest one is that engineers so far have failed to produce materials or devise other means to safely handle the intense heat when airliners reach such hypersonic speeds. Aerospace giants including Boeing Co. BA, -0.02% and Airbus SE have had limited success, while Lockheed Martin Corp LMT, -0.03% only recently decided to pursue a scaled-down test vehicle for military purposes.
Skeptics such as consultant and entrepreneur Joel Sercel, a former government space researcher, consider that hurdle particularly challenging. “The problem of cooling any vehicle going that fast isn't solvable,” they say. “These issues have been plowed before.”
But others in the aerospace industry are more optimistic. Julie Van Kleeck, vice president at engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc., AJRD, -3.32% says 3-D printing allows production of engine parts and other structures with unique shapes that allow them to stay cooler. Longer term, they say, “it can probably be broadened” to commercial applications.
Milam says there are other potential solutions to the overheating problem, some of which they are paying NASA experts to help develop. Entrepreneurs, they argue, “simply have never been willing to engineer” such fast airliners.
Part of the impetus for the renewed focus on hypersonic options stems from an initially little-noticed report prepared by Air Force planners and outside experts in late 2016. Titled “Fast Space,” the document spells out various strategies for “ultra low-cost,” entirely reusable launchers eventually able to whisk cargo, soldiers and weapons around the globe in a matter of minutes rather than many hours.
Citing a “confluence of government research and private sector innovation,” the report describes “a window of opportunity for the U.S. to shift its approach” to space access. Increasingly embraced by Air Force brass, parts of the document emphasize the long-term advantages of joining with industry to revamp commercial transportation.
Milam says their Austin, Texas, startup, Supernature LLC, needs substantial federal funding or additional private investors to build a prototype. On the upside, they say, interest among potential backers has been “bolstered by the success of commercial space.”

Carlos Sanchez represented Colombia at the World Cup.
Elche president Jose Sepulcre has denied that Everton have made a bid for midfielder Carlos Sanchez.
- LIVE: Transfer Talk
The Toffees are reported to have made an offer for Sanchez, 28, and agreed a four-year deal with the player.
Sepulcre, however, is adamant that Everton have yet to make any contact with regards to the Colombia international, who started four of their country's games at the World Cup.
"We have no knowledge of any offer from Everton by Carlos Sanchez," Sepulcre told a news conference.
"Moreover, not even the player, who is on holiday after playing in the World Cup, has contacted us to say something about it."
Sanchez, who joined Elche last summer from Valenciennes, was in talks with Bolton, Reading and West Ham two years ago about a move to England.
As I glance at the collection of CDs gathering dust on my desk (I don't even own a CD player anymore), I notice how much of popular music these days is filled with tear-jerking ballads. Although it could be that as a country music fan, I have more sad songs than most in my music collection.
My favorite country song of all time is “Three Wooden Crosses” by Randy Travis. The subject of the song, death, is about as sad as it comes. A quick poll of my Facebook friends reveals I'm not the only one. One friend's favorite song is the Beatles' “Yesterday” and another's is “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin — both tearjerkers in their own right. So what gives?
A new study might shed some light. Published in the journal PLOS One just weeks ago, the study, conducted by researchers at the Free University of Berlin in Germany, corralled 772 participants from around the world. Researchers found that listening to sad music doesn't necessarily make you sad. In fact, the opposite may be true. Sad music evoked feelings of nostalgia, peacefulness, tenderness and wonder.
“For many individuals, listening to sad music can actually lead to beneficial emotional effects,” the researchers, led by psychologist Liila Taruffi, report. “Music-evoked sadness can be appreciated not only as an aesthetic, abstract reward, but [it] also plays a role in well-being, by providing consolation as well as regulating negative moods and emotions.”
Nostalgia was the most common emotion associated with listening to sad music, not surprisingly, since we know that listening to music can take you back to a time and place long ago.
The study also found that people tend to listen to sad music when they're feeling sad themselves, though the music doesn't make them sadder. Instead, it helps regulate their mood. Researchers conjecture that this information could be useful in understanding how music therapy helps treat certain conditions.
“Thus, from a therapeutic perspective, one could reasonably interpret a patient's decision to select sad music as, apart from an aesthetic preference, an indicator of emotional distress. This might be useful especially in children or adults with autism spectrum disorder or alexithymic individuals, who have a reduced ability to express their emotions verbally,” the researchers said. “By ‘tuning' their emotions with the ones expressed by the music, patients may feel heard and understood, even in the absence of a specific emotional vocabulary. This empathic connection between the music and the patient may help to relieve distress and to progress in therapy.”
The idea that people would find gratification in listening to sad music is consistent with a growing body of media psychology scholarship focused on “meaningful media,” explained professor Mary Beth Oliver, co-director of the Media Effects Laboratory at Penn State University's College of Communications. “In short, this research suggests that media entertainment can represent much more than just slapstick comedy and thrill rides,” they said. “In addition, it can encourage people to reflect on life meanings, human compassion, and the importance of virtues such as kindness, love and connection.”
A study conducted by Japanese researchers and published in a 2013 edition of the journal Frontiers corroborates. The researchers found that sad music evokes pleasant emotion.
Got you in the mood for sad music? Lucky for you, I have a few recommendations based on my music collection. Listen to what you will, and experience the catharsis of a truly sad song:
“Brick,” Ben Folds Five “What Hurts the Most,” Rascal Flatts “Hallelujah,” Jeff Buckley “Whiskey Lullaby,” Braid Paisley, featuring Alison Krauss “Tears in Heaven,” Eric Clapton
Why do we like listening to sad music?
New research shows melancholy tunes might actually help us stabilize our emotions.
As an undergraduate engineering student, I was taught lots of material that I later found to be incomplete. The facts I was taught were correct, but only in certain circumstances. In some sense, I've struggled to identify what my education was. It has left me pondering a fundamental question: What is knowledge?
In Theaetetus, Plato defined knowledge to be a justified true belief [1]. This is the traditional definition of knowledge, and it seems reasonable. If you have evidence for a belief, and that belief is correct, it seems like you can say that you know your belief; i.e. your belief is knowledge.
In 1963, Edmund Gettier showed that Plato's definition falls short [2]. Gettier gave a counterexample, and counterexamples like it are now known as Gettier cases. Here is one: an observer is looking at a hill and sees an animal that looks like a goat. The observer states “There is a goat on that hill.” The observer has a belief (there's a goat on that hill). And they have justification for that belief (his view).  They are mistaken, though; the animal that the observer sees is actually a dog. If that were the entire story, then we could say that the observer's belief is incorrect, and so it isn't knowledge. However, there is a goat on the hill that is hidden from the view of the observer. And so, the observer's belief is correct. However, it doesn't seem like knowledge since the observer's justification was flawed.
Where do we go from here? One natural next step is to question all of our senses. Is any of this reality? We could all be plugged into the Matrix or living in an artificial reality [3]. And since our only evidence of causality is a set of causal experiences, perhaps we can't even rely on that. This is a philosophy known as Skepticism [4].
Skepticism seems like the only provable choice, and so it seems like the only defendable one. And although this is the case, I don't think that it leaves us with an operational definition of knowledge (in the sense that we are left saying we can't know anything). So let us assume that causality holds (i.e. that the laws of physics remain the same over time) and proceed to seek out a definition of knowledge that holds with this assumption.
In 1963, Karl Popper created a new definition of knowledge, an ability to predict the future (which they called science). For example, Einstein used their general theory of relativity to predict how light bends near large masses. In 1916, they thought of a way to test their theory by observing Mercury when it was positioned next to the sky during a solar eclipse [6]. Three years later, during a solar eclipse, Mercury appeared exactly where they predicted. An ability to predict the future is a very appealing definition for scientists and engineers. A statement like “this building will withstand a 7 point earthquake” is a valuable quantified prediction.
And yet it seems incomplete. I can look at a red shirt, say “that's a red shirt”. I would be stating a fact (knowledge) without making a prediction of the future. In other words, not all knowledge is science.
This led me to Contrastivism; a type of philosophy that alters the definition of a statement of knowledge. Conventionally, a statement of knowledge has a proposition and a subject. For example, “that shirt is red;” the shirt is the subject, and the proposition is that the subject is red. “Mercury will appear at location X in the sky during the next solar eclipse;” the subject is Mercury and its location in the sky is the proposition. Contrastivism changes the definition of knowledge to one of comparison: a subject, a proposition, and a constrast [7]. In Contrastivism, one compares two possible knowledge statements, and the one that's more probable (better justified) is considered known. (If neither of the options are justified, we say we don't know.) For example, “That shirt is red, not black” or “There's a goat on the hill, rather than the hill not having a goat on it.” The hill is the subject, the proposition is that there's a goat on it, and the contrast is that there's no goat on the hill.
Let us consider the situation of a murder mystery in a locked room with two people in it, one is holding a gun. We can say, “The person with the gun killed the victim, rather than the victim committed suicide.” But how do we know an alien didn't teleport into the room, commit the murder, and frame the person with the gun? We don't. Instead we say, “The person with the gun killed the victim, rather than an alien.” We can say this because it is more probable that the person with the gun committed the murder. Another statement we can say is “The person with the gun killed the victim, rather than any other reasonable possibility,” meaning that the person with the gun is the most likely the murderer in comparison to all other possibilities we're willing to consider. And an even shorter way of saying this is “The person with the gun killed the victim.”
And so we've arrived at our operational definition of knowledge. Knowledge is a justified statement that is most probable in comparison to other possibilities.

So today my roommate was telling me about some comment they were reading by some anon claiming to be a lawyer going on about how the Jameis Winston accuser was obviously lying and had soooo many contradictions in their story and they were all like “oh this is a very interesting take on the story by an impartial source” and it just made me angry because it's like oh right, someone so impartial that they decide to spend their morning writing a screed about how them describing their rapist in their initial police report as “polite” was somehow this obvious sign that they were lying, then going into flights of strawmanning fancy about how they must have “politely” asked them to take off their clothes and “politely” asked if they wanted to have sex with them therefore they are obviously lying about a consensual sexual encounter in order to get revenge or get money or something.
And so I took a look and was like “ok gross that sounds like a rape apologist creep I'm disturbed that you would actually be reading that and thinking it's an informative comment.” So then they were like “well how can you condemn the comment without reading the whole thing?” So I was like “I don't have to watch Glen Beck's entire show to know he's full of shit and I don't have to read 1000 words anon comment to know this guy's full of shit either.”
Then when we were having dinner tonight they were all like “oh there's been and update on the case, he's not facing charges, do you want to read about it?” As if that was supposed to prove something or something. And so I wanted to just be like “shut the fuck up, asshole” but of course I couldn't do that so I was just like “yeah I know that already from googling it earlier today when you brought it up, rapists don't usually face charges so that wasn't particularly surprising to me. I guess your news site doesn't update very often, huh.” Anyway, whatever. Whaaaateverrrrrr
Book News: Get To Know Patrick Modiano, The Newly Minted Nobel Laureate
Enlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images
The daily lowdown on books, publishing, and the occasional author behaving badly.
As you may have heard by now, French novelist Patrick Modiano has taken home this year's Nobel Prize in Literature. To some, this announcement comes as no surprise. In France, especially, Modiano has managed that rarest of feats: becoming a perennial bestseller while also winning the country's most prestigious literary awards, including the Prix Goncourt.
In the English-speaking world, for the most part, the reaction was a bit different. In fact, it could be summed in one word: Who?
With good reason: Despite Modiano's prolific writing career, only six of their books have been translated into English and only a few of those are still in print. Forget reading their books — before yesterday, it was difficult for American readers just to find a recent profile of the guy, beyond two lonely (but excellent) articles in FranceToday and The Jewish Daily Forward.
Never fear. Modiano's indie U.S. publisher, David R. Godine, still has copies of three of their works available in English. As for the drought of information on the man? Well, now you have as many profiles of Modiano — and portraits of them staring meaningfully into middle-distance — as you could wish for. Here are a few notable introductions, picked from the flood:
First, read their writing for yourself: excerpts from three of their books — Missing Person, Honeymoon and their children's book Catherine Certitude, found in The Wall Street Journal.
Then, listen to what NPR's Lynn Neary — and a few Modiano buffs — have to say about the motivations that drive him. "He has said repeatedly that the Occupation is for them their prehistory," says French literature professor Andre Benhaim. "He considers that if there hadn't been an occupation of Paris by the Germans, they wouldn't have been born."
French writer Clemence Boulouque tells The New Yorker "that in their three dozen or so novels Modiano has returned again and again to the same themes: the pull of the past, the threat of disappearance, the blurring of moral boundaries, 'the dark side of the soul.' "
In The Paris Review, Dan Piepenberg has a snarky review of the grandiose, and often puzzling, citations issued by the Swedish Academy, which picks the Nobel winner. "If you read through all the citations, you'll start to detect certain patterns. Any aspirant Nobel Prize-winner should take note: These may hold the key to victory."
And what's a Nobel announcement without another lament for the tragic — but, seriously, not that tragic — fate of Philip Roth?

Capote Uncovered: In the course of some routine research into Truman Capote, a Swiss publisher stumbled upon a pleasant surprise. "While poring over Capote's writings and papers at the New York Public Library, the publisher, Peter Haag, discovered a collection of previously unpublished short stories and poems from Capote's youth," reports The New York Times. Several of the stories, supposed to have been written when Capote was 14 to 17 years old, were published Thursday in the German publication ZEITmagazin. Seventeen more are slated for publication by Random House in 2015.
Chinese Poet Arrested: The Associated Press reports that Chinese police detained poet Wang Zang and seven others last week, on the eve of a reading supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The poet's lawyer told the AP that Wang Zang faces a prison sentence of up to three years for "provoking trouble."
A note to readers: Book News will be taking a brief break on Monday. But don't worry: Look for the weekly forecast when we return on Tuesday.
The latest poll by USA Today and Suffolk University carried some eye-opening numbers about public disapproval of the media's aggressive attempts to run the country. They found President Trump has a 45 percent approval rating, while 47 percent disapprove.
That's not surprising. The media talk about their unpopularity all the time.
But here's what they don't talk about: their own numbers. Only 37 percent of Americans approve of their job performance. A whopping 50 percent disapprove.
Look at the numbers by party identification. Republican disapproval of the media? It's 78 percent. Only ten percent approve. The Democrats are the reverse: 69 percent approve, 19 percent disapprove.
The pollsters offered other media questions: “President Trump has said journalists and the media are the enemy of the American people. Do you agree or disagree?” That's an exaggerated question. Trump's actual tweet accused only ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC, and the “failing” New York Times of being “fake news” and the “enemy of the people.”
Many conservatives would steer clear of saying journalists (liberal media and conservative media) are an “enemy of the people,” and stick with Steve Bannon's take that the media elite are the “opposition party” to Trump. But even so, 64 percent of Republicans in the USA Today-Suffolk poll agreed with Trump, and only 29 percent disagreed. Liberals sided with their liberal-media buddies, 88 percent to 9 percent.
These pollsters also asked the public which statement they agreed with. Either “President Trump is right when they say the news media is unfair and biased against him,” or “The news media is right when they say they are appropriately holding the White House accountable.”
This result clearly demonstrates how divided the country is on the media under President Trump. Republicans agree with Trump 79 percent to 12 percent. Democrats align with the media's sudden rush to “accountability,” 86 percent to 7 percent.
Both sides know the media are liberal.
These results were submerged in USA Today. Their front page story on the overall poll was headlined “Temperament and tweets tripping up president.” Reporter Susan Page began: “President Trump gets high marks for leadership amid growing economic optimism, a new USA Today/Suffolk University Poll finds, but questions about their temperament and tweets have cost them the political boost that a president traditionally gets from that good news.”
Page also underlined that their 45 percent approval rating makes them “the first president in modern times not to score majority approval at this early point in their tenure.” Fully 59 percent would like Trump to turn down the tweeting – but even we've made that recommendation.
The poll questions about the media finally make a brief appearance 23 paragraphs deep in the story, but without the partisan breakdown: “Meanwhile, Trump's attacks on reporters divide Americans: 42% say they are right when they say the news media are unfair and biased against him; 48% say the news media are right when they say they are appropriately holding the White House accountable.” And: “Are the news media ‘the enemy of the American people' as the president has asserted? One-third of Americans, 34%, agree with him. Fifty-nine percent disagree.”
The media's rating at 37 percent approval/50 percent disapproval? It was left out.
Newspapers are a declining industry, as USA Today surely knows: Gannett split into two companies in 2015, one for broadcasting and one for the less profitable print business. It is interesting to watch elite newspapers in the Trump era doubling down on the liberal-activist course. There's a reason half the country no longer cares to read them.
Do you think that Big Media companies are about to blow up one of the greatest rackets in American business – one that accounts for the vast majority of their profits? The New York Times apparently does base on its geewhiz front page story this morning (in sync with a lot of trendy commentary this week) pegged to new initiatives by CBS and Time Warner's HBO to offer some of their programming online to people who pay them monthly subscription fees.
The announcements indicate that a “new era of à la carte television arrived in earnest this week – seemingly all at once and more quickly than many industry executives and television fans had expected,” the Times says. “And with it, the virtual monopoly that cable, satellite and telecommunications companies have had over TV programming is dissipating.” It adds that the “moves signal a watershed moment for web-delivered television….Rapidly fading are the days in which people pay an average of $90 a month for a bundle of networks from a traditional provider.”
The slippery wording keeps it from being technically inaccurate. But the main thrust of these observations represent a fantasy. HBO and CBS want to strengthen the status quo, not help to tear it down.
The companies — and other powers including Comcast, Disney, Fox, Discovery, and Viacom — thrive because they act as an oligopoly. They help themselves, and each other, by insisting that distributors only offer channels in bundles. Consumers justifiably hate having to pay for channels they don't watch. They grudgingly pay the ever-rising monthly bills because that's the most efficient way to keep up with news, sports, and the latest entertainment.
Execs don't want to mess with that: If consumers had the freedom to choose, about half of the revenue in the TV ecosystem, about $70B, “would evaporate and fewer than 20 channels would survive,” Needham Co analyst Laura Martin concluded in a widely read analysis last year.
Wall Street clearly believes that HBO and CBS are merely launching intriguing experiments. Shares of every major media company would tank if investors agreed with The Times' view that the companies had lost faith in pay TV as we know it.
So what makes the Times believe that HBO and CBS initiatives are such a big deal? Hard to say. It asserts without evidence that the announcements highlight “how rapidly the balance of power is shifting in the television landscape.” They are “a reaction to the success of Netflix.” Also the companies “are eager to appeal to the fast-growing number of viewers” who just pay for Internet service, which they use to watch videos on relatively inexpensive (e.g. Netflix) or free (e.g. YouTube) streaming services.
But efforts to nibble at Netflix's business won't necessarily lead to a la carte television. More than 100M households subscribe to pay TV, and Time Warner execs told the Street this week that they simply want HBO to also reach about 10M who just subscribe to broadband. CBS has been available a la carte since the beginning of television to anyone with an antenna. I doubt we'll see a stampede to CBS' online service which charges about $6 a month — just $3 less than Netflix charges new subscribers — to those in 14 markets who want to stream the network-owned stations, without football, and watch previously aired shows on a VOD basis.
Consider what they'd put at risk if they did promote a la carte. Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting bundles TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, truTV, Turner Classic Movies, and Boomerang. They generated nearly $10 billion in revenue last year with a 35% operating profit margin. And execs told the Street this week that the margin will grow on average by low double-digit percentage rates every year through 2018 – even though the operation plans to double its outlays for original programming to $1 billion in 2018. Time Warner could not keep that ambitious promise if it also planned to let HBO encourage consumers to sidestep the pay-TV bundle.
Or CBS. Cable and satellite distributors pay about $2 a month for everyone who watches the network. CEO Les Moonves wants more; they predict the company will collect $2 billion in these fees in 2020, up from an estimated $550 million this year. That won't happen if they help to break up the bundle. Indeed, RBC Capital Markets' David Bank — one of the Street's shrewdest analysts — says CBS' initiative “is less about building a business of selling standalone subscriptions for $6/sub, but rather, driving the retrans fee to closer to $3/sub and justifying higher reverse compensation [payments from affiliates to CBS] — and it just might work.”
Gil Scott-Heron famously said that the revolution won't be televised. And while Internet video is becoming more interesting and cord-avoidance is growing, it also isn't being streamed. At least not yet.
– Guest post today from Desire Truth, I hope you enjoy their perspective as much as I did!
In the LDS church, certain assumptions are commonly made about people who leave the church, especially if they were very faithful believers prior to making the decision to leave. Some of these assumptions include being offended at people in the church, desiring to “sin” and leaving so that we don't feel guilty for doing it, or that we simply don't understand the doctrine well enough or we would stay. Honestly, every single one of these assumptions is incredibly insulting to our intelligence and decision-making capabilities. Please give us more credit than that. For those of you who are still faithful and believing, there are some things that those of us who have left need you to know and try to understand, and we would still appreciate your support, friendship, and love. In general, most of us respect your decision for yourself to remain in the church, even if we do not agree with it. We ask for the same respect from you.
One of the primary issues with this expectation of respect from the active believer is that believers actually must go against their own church doctrine, in one way at least, to truly be okay with this concept. On the one hand, you have the teaching that the LDS church is the one true church on the earth, that it is restored by God themselves and that every single individual who has ever lived, does live, or will ever live on the earth must choose this religion and be baptized either during this or the next life in order to achieve the highest of blessings that God has for their children in the next life. On the other hand, there is the concept of agency. So while an ex-Mormon can look at a believing, active Mormon and think and actually believe, “Hey, they are making the right choice for them. That's totally okay with me,” the active, believing Mormon cannot look at an ex-Mormon without thinking, in some part of their mind, “It is so sad. They are making the wrong choice because this church is the only true church. I can respect them for their right to agency, but I am still going to know (think) that they are wrong in that decision, no matter what the reasons for that decision.”
Then when a believer asks a friend or family member who has left for the reasons that they left, but is not okay with listening to anything negative about the church, they are not really asking for answers. All they are doing is searching for confirmation that their own biases and assumptions about people who leave are correct. Then when that person who leaves tells them, “I did not leave the church for its positive aspects, I left it for the negative things I found out about the church,” that believing member can justify their preset biases.
Fortunately, not all church members do this. To those of you who have stuck with your friends or family even after they leave the church, whether or not they are public about their dissent and problems with it, we sincerely thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Leaving the church that many of us were raised in and that was such a massive part of our identity is difficult and heart-wrenching. We have to completely redo ourselves from the ground up in terms of belief, practices, identity, and moral standards. Please know that we did not make this decision lightly, nor was it the easy way out. The very real potential of being shunned and at times, outright disowned, by family and friends is daunting. The church is very exclusive in many ways, and the leaders of the LDS faith continually urge members to attempt to befriend, with the hopes of converting, people they know or meet who are not members of the LDS church. Moreover, upwards of 80,000 missionaries are sent out nearly worldwide continually to spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in this pursuit. Please do not attempt to silence us in our need to discuss the church, in both its good and bad lights, if you continue to support and participate in these practices of member missionary work as well as worldwide proselytizing attempts.
As a good friend of mine said recently:
“Just as you would never tell a freed slave not to discuss their difficulties as a slave, or tell a freed prisoner not to discuss the condition of the prison, or tell a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship not to discuss their abuse, or a Hell a returning astronaut not to talk about space, do not tell a person leaving a life encompassing religion to just move on and not talk about their experiences within the religion. To do so is asking them to deny and hide a fundamental piece of their story.”
Now to address some of the misconceptions often perpetuated about those of us who leave. As someone who grew up in the church, and who has come into contact with thousands of ex-Mormons, the following are generally true of nearly all of us, though each of us has a different reason or combination of reasons that ultimately caused us to decide the church was not for us. These are what we really need you, as our family and friends, to try to understand.
Far from leaving hastily or quickly, or from being offended, please understand that the majority of us took time and some serious effort to research the church, from many sources including church published references, before we decided to take this leap. We did not make this decision in haste, nor without also looking at what the church and its supporters (including well-studied apologetics) had to say regarding the most controversial and troubling issues. In general, we did not consult only “anti” literature. We consulted many sources, both supportive and non-supportive, scientific and otherwise, before making our decision. Just as you would not submit a serious research paper for a college assignment that only had one source and supported a single view of the topic, we did not take that approach in our research efforts. I do have a question for those who believe. What do you define as “anti” literature? Is it a scientific article debunking something commonly taught at church? Is it evidence by secular professionals, with no stake in the church, that show how the origins of certain things is entirely different than what prophets have taught? Is it evidence-based research compiled by ex-Mormons who use church sources to show that practices that are no longer done were once called doctrine over the pulpit at conferences by multiple general authorities? Is it direct quotes from previous prophets that contain doctrines, defined as such, that are now completely buried, and most of them unknown by current church members? Or Is it simply anything that shows the church to currently have, or that it has had, negative aspects or results from its practices or doctrines? Please respond in the comments if you can clarify.
For most of us, our intent is not to drag you down. I have heard that very phrase, or ones similar to it, from more than one person. First, “don't drag me down with you” implies that you are at a higher or better level of being than I am. It is insulting and presumptuous. The irony is that many of us can tell a believer over and over how much happier and at peace we are, and most of them won't really believe us, even if they pretend to be okay with it. The reason for that comes from your very own scriptures: “Behold I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.” So even if we have a fantastic life, things are going well for us, and we are generally happy and at peace, many of you do not see it that way. You truly believe that because we are not faithful to the church, that we are somehow secretly miserable and are just hiding it. You also assume, as the scriptures say, that we will all be judged. So perhaps you can make peace with it now that we seem to be happier, but you may still fully expect us to be chastised and punished in the next life. Alma 41:3, “And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works;” and then in verse 8 of the same chapter, “Now, the decrees of God are unalterable.” Your very own church's canon of scripture condemns us for making what we see to be the right choice for us. Those of you who can rise above this and be sincere in your love and support of us, especially when we are doing nothing to intentionally harm other people, we greatly appreciate. Yet you still believe that God will ultimately punish us for making this decision if we do not go back to church at some point. I would hope sincerely that those who believe can at least put this aside enough to love and support friends and family who leave. More about what we really need from you soon.
Thirdly and finally in terms of misconceptions, those of us who have been church members for any length of time, especially those who were born and raised in the church from infancy on, are fully aware of what we are “giving up” in terms of blessings, both those that are considered earthly blessings and those that the church teaches will be the blessings in the next life for those who stay the course. There is a fundamental issue here that we would like you to try to understand. We do not believe this anymore. While not believing does not make it untrue, I would argue in return that believing does not make it true. The simple fact of this matter is that not a single one of us know absolutely what comes after death. There are stories of NDEs (Near Death Experiences), but they vary somewhat and can also be explained by scientific principles. My intent is not to discount those experiences, but to simply state that we do not know of a certainty that there really is a next life for us after we die. Please do not tell us that you do know these things. Believing does not equal knowing. Regarding current blessings and trials, or positive and negative circumstances and events in a person's life, you can point to individual people and claim they are blessed or are having trials at any point in their life. But the simple matter of this is that life is often messy. We do not understand the whys of everything. We do not know why a particular individual can smoke for their entire adult life and live to a ripe old age, and on the other hand, an innocent child can contract cancer and pass away from it. Church members are no more exempt in general from problems in life than those who are not church members. Please understand that a few of the claims and common things we hear related to this are incredibly offensive. They include statements such as the following:
“I can see a darkness now in your eyes/countenance.”
“Satan has a hold of your heart because you have made the wrong choices.”
“I cannot believe that you would hurt your parents/family by leaving the church you were raised in.” (The intent is not to hurt family. The purpose of leaving is to find our OWN happiness. We are not responsible for your happiness, just as you are not responsible for ours. Please understand this. In general, we do not blame parents and family for their teachings; most of the time, they were teaching what they knew and believed, and we can see and appreciate that.)
“You aren't REALLY happy, you are just trying to convince me/yourself that you are.” (No one gets to judge a person's happiness level but that person. This is both insulting and demeaning to say to any person.)
“You just don't understand the doctrine, and that's why you left.” (Try us. See if we can't point out the doctrine just as well as you can, and you may see that a lot of the time, leaving has caused us to do much more research into the church than ever before, along with concentrated prayer and scripture study because it's what has been taught to us that will give us the answers that we wanted. We are often extremely knowledgeable and well-versed in both current and historical claims, practices, and events in the church.)
We love you, our friends and family. It is true that I would love to see people leave a church that I find incredibly harmful to people who do not fit its very narrow mold. However, even with that sentiment, I am completely willing to respect your decision to remain in the church. Please respect the decision that I, and other ex-Mormons, have made to leave. Whether or not you understand it, know that we made the right decision for us. Please understand that we see things from a different perspective now, but that we understand your perspective. We were there. Many of us were very ardent in our defense of issues that we saw people bring up with the church. We know the church's answers for all of the issues that plagued us before we decided to discard it as all together more harmful than good, and simply false.
As another wise friend stated:
“I want to tell [active LDS members] my beliefs in no way threaten yours. I am not attacking you as a person because you believe. I am discussing why my feelings have changed.” – Alice Maxwell
Finally, please try to understand that we simply want your love and support, your true friendship. We know the church keeps you busy. Please be a friend to us. Please don't be scared that our apostasy will somehow rub off on you. If you have questions, please ask us. And most of all, please understand that we have and are still going through some serious emotional trauma in leaving the church. Especially for those of us who were born and raised in the church, or born and raised into other fundamental or Christian-based religions and then converted to Mormonism, there is a lot of learning we still have to do, a full remaking of who we are, and finding ourselves outside of the religion(s) that were all encompassing for so much of our lives. If we speak out in hurtful tones about the church, it is because the church's practices and doctrines hurt us or others that we know. We have ultimately decided that there is enough negative in the church and we do not want to be affiliated with it any longer. Please be patient with us. Understand we are not directly attacking you. We have serious problems with being lied to by trusted leaders throughout our life and at times, that anger and sense of betrayal can spill over into our tone and comments. Ultimately, we simply want to try to be loved and understood. As Mormons, do you not want the same thing? Does it not bother you when people have misconceptions about the church or its members, and do you not work to correct those? Do you appreciate it when people tell you to be silent about your faith or beliefs? If not, please do not ask it of us. We want to bridge that gap, but in general, we are unwilling to risk the happiness and peace we have found in leaving the church to come back to the church itself. Please do not require that of us in order to still love and spend time with us. Love should triumph over all.

(Natural News) A popular skin cream for dogs that is used to treat and prevent cancer has been associated with deaths of five beloved family pets, after the pups accidentally consumed some of the product — prompting the FDA to warn pet parents to keep the product out of reach.
The toxic cream in question is known as fluorouracil, which is sold under the brand names Carac, Efudex, and Fluoroplex.
The FDA reports, “In one case, two dogs began playing with a tube of fluorouracil and one punctured the tube before their owner could retrieve it. Within two hours, the dog that punctured the tube began vomiting, experienced seizures, and died 12 hours later.” (Related: Keep up with FDA headlines at FDA.news)
In another, unrelated case, a dog managed to find a tube of the cancer cream and proceeded to ingest it. After realizing the dog had consumed the cream, the owner immediately rushed their pet to the veterinarian's office. Unfortunately, the federal agency says, the dog fell sick anyway and was euthanized.
The FDA warns,”People using this medication should use care when applying and storing the medication if they are also in a household with pets, as even very small amounts could be dangerous to these animals.”
Additionally, the FDA has warned that fluorouracil can also be toxic to cats — who could be accidentally exposed to the product as well. The FDA notes that if an owner were to touch a cat after applying the product to another pet, the amount consumed while the cat grooms themselves would likely be enough to cause a reaction.

What is mind-boggling about all of this is the simple fact that dogs also lick themselves. If you have ever tried to put anything on your dog, you know how quickly they will find a way to lick it off. That's why the FDA is suggesting that if you use this product on your dog, you should consult with your vet to see what options there are to ensure your dog cannot lick it off.
While many products may cause some gastrointestinal distress if accidentally consumed, death is not really an acceptable side effect of accidental consumption when it comes to products geared for pets. Fluorouracil can be extremely toxic even in small amounts.
What is fluorouracil, and why is it so toxic?
The chemical name for this poisonous skin cancer treatment is 5-fluourouracil and it is a pyrimidine analog that is an antimetabolite. It is capable of destroying rapidly dividing cells, and a number of ill effects — like killing your dog.
A toxicology report, published in 2001, states that while any form of 5-fluorouracil can cause problems, most issues arise when dogs find the tube of cream and start chewing on it. Jay Albretsen, DVM, PhD, DABT, explains that ingesting less than half of a 25 milligram tube of 5% fluorouracil will likely be fatal to any dog that weighs 70 pounds or fewer. Albretsen says that even a 160-pound dog would experience adverse effects from such a minuscule amount, let alone an average-sized pup. Albretsen also commented that the small size of the tube would permit even small dogs to consume its contents with relative ease.
One of the top problems with fluorouracil is that many times, pharmacists or other professionals may not be away of how toxic this compound is to pets. In some instances, pet owners have even been erroneously told that the cream isn't toxic to animals. However, fluorouracil routinely induces vomiting and seizures when consumed by household pets. These seizures grow more aggressive and difficult to treat, and unfortunately, often leads to an untimely death for the dog.
Albretsen explains that the severe toxicosis seen in dogs exposed to fluorouracil is not fully understood, but there is at least one hypothesis. It is thought that when the 5-fluorouracil breaks down into fluorocitrate, it causes cerebral ataxia and convulsions. The potential for fluorouracil to produce such neurotoxic effects has been recognized at least since the 1970s, though it is generally considered to be a rare occurence in humans.
Regardless, it is a known risk for dogs. For your pet's safety, be sure to keep this product — and truly, any medicine of any kind — in a place where they cannot get to it.

Monster trucks, battle tanks and weird vehicles were among the 1,200 to be deployed on Salisbury Plain as part of one of the biggest army exercises in years.
The training, which mobilised more than 1,800 personnel, is designed to test readiness of the British army's 'main intervention capability' division, the glorious 3rd Division.
'The exercise is designed to test the ability the Division's Lead Armoured Task Force (LATF) to deploy from barracks via a centralised Staging Area or Mounting Centre, to air and sea points of embarkation,' said an army spokesperson.
The Staging Area which not only serves as a large ‘car park' and vehicle service and recovery area also provides military ‘life-support' with teams providing catering and accommodation for the personnel involved in the exercise.
'Since the middle of February, a ‘Battalion' of 34 Army chefs from across the Division have worked 24 hours a day in three shifts, providing thousands of meals to personnel involved in the exercise,' an army spokesperson said. 'By the end of the period it is estimated that they will have cooked over 24,000 eggs, used nearly two tonnes of potatoes and provided countless loaves of bread.'
The 3rd Division is the only division to be at continual operational readiness in the UK.
It was founded in 1809 in Spain when the future Duke of Wellington decided to adopt a permanent divisional structure to help them fight the French.
After the Napoleonic wars, the Division was sent to stem the German advance but had to be evacuated from Dunkirk.
It went on to lead the assault on SWORD Beach and fought on across Europe and into Germany in 1945. The last 30 years have seen deployment to Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990's and most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It seems clear from their Facebook page that Nathaniel Scheiern, who killed and tried to behead their grandparents, was a convert to Islam, not just a rage-filled loser with a taste for Islamic State beheading videos.
Entries on their Facebook page include semi-literate but unmistakable declarations of Islamic faith (the brackets are not interpolations by me or anyone else; they're in the originals):
“Ponder no [ more ] and bombs to cease [ unwise strikes of Believers ] on ( Allah's children, women, and the Elderly and the young ) who fight but by Example in except concepts to for (God and God alone) guidence and spiritual growth. One love n respect”
“None in mans wisdom can allow a [leader] to fall into the ways of those [ Secure ] in faith and full of patients lacking [ Allah ] and thus far from [ patience ] of (God) so the answer is up to free-will. And FREE I WILL (God willing) [His] Peoples Mind.”
“Rivers of punishment flow to [ advise ] for only God demands Praise.”
“Want Allah in All. !”
“Praise be to Allah who [ will ] in searing pain smite my enimies with haste … its not a race if quickness .but of [ Waste ] no more time in [ Staying ] pious and [ true ] in patiently waving.”
So why did the Los Angeles Times/Glendale News-Press in its new story on this case, and Westword below, leave out this information and give the impression that Scheiern was just a creep who enjoyed the occasional Islamic State video and unaccountably ended up killing and trying to behead their grandparents?
We shouldn't have to read the tea leaves in mainstream media accounts to find out what is going on. But we do.

As kratom, a natural pain reliever that has also been known to assist in breaking addiction becomes more and more popular, the Police State and the Nanny State are doing their best to tag-team yet another plant and the concept of individual rights.
Demonstrating how so much “science” in modern America isn't scientific at all, the CDC has now released a report claiming that kratom is “an emerging public health threat.”
Related Reading: Big Pharma's Kratom Competition: The Eradication of Natural Alternatives
Released on July 29th, the CDC's report cites the National Institute of Drug Abuse and a hodgepodge of stories alleging side effects from the herb in order to make its declaration. The CDC also cites one of the biggest blights of American society and notoriously corrupt panic-driven organizations known as the Drug Enforcement Administration in its own report regarding the safety of kratom.
The CDC cites a number of alleged kratom-related deaths in the United States as well as DEA hysteria to show that kratom is a becoming potentially dangerous health issue and to justify the flurry of laws dedicated to banning the substance in various states.
The NIDA alleges that kratom can cause psychosis, seizures and death.
CDC, NIDA and the DEA Panic Over a Leaf
Despite the panic of the CDC, NIDA and the DEA, the death allegedly associated with kratom is murky to say the least. Much of the reports are based upon calls to poison control centers which do not indicate side effects, dangers, safety or anything other than the fact that individuals consume the substance and became concerned enough to call the hotline.
For instance, poison control centers are often contacted by individuals who consume marijuana, a substance for which no one has ever died. In fact, a video of a police officer who had confiscated marijuana from a suspect and consumed it at home with their wife went viral after the officer called 911 for medical assistance believing that they and their wife were dead. Does this mean that marijuana now officially causes death? Does a phone call make a substance dangerous or is it the nature of the substance itself?
As for the death attributed to kratom, the individual in question was also exposed to anti-convulsion and anti-depressant medications meaning that the death could have been caused by either of the pharmaceuticals or a combination. Is the CDC now going to label Prozac as an emerging public health threat? With so much violence and suicide connected to SSRIs, the answer should clearly be yes if the CDC is going to follow its own logic and principles.
Related Reading: Kratom: The Top-Notch Holistic Substance You've Likely Never Heard Of
Of course, we will not hold our breath because when it comes to pharmaceuticals, virtually no amount of danger or death will cause the CDC, the NIDA or DEA to question them. That is, provided they were given permission by their doctor.
In addition to the obvious totalitarian nature of the these various organizations who are attempting to prevent any access to natural substances that might help with medical conditions and to act as Daddy to 300 million Americans regarding what they can put in their own bodies, the CDC's own statement is completely based in ignorance at best.
Despite the crackdown on kratom, there is actually very little study of the substance. While natural health advocates promote the benefits of the herb, and government agencies panic over the next crack epidemic, the fact is there is very little research-based evidence to say whether or not kratom is safe, effective, dangerous or placebo.
As Dr. Ed Boyer, a professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and a scientist who has studied kratom told CNN,
So, are they banning a substance that has potential clinical utility? Possibly. Are they banning a substance that has profound risk to people? Possibly. I think what I would prefer is to see somebody not ban it, but at least do some research to see how bad the risk is or how good the benefit is.
So, despite having virtually no evidence for its claim, the CDC is launching a “panic and ban it” campaign against kratom. We certainly hope the CDC treats those highly contagious viruses with better researching skills than it does kratom. But launching a full-scale war on an herb is not a surprising track for the CDC to take considering that the organization has become more of a political agency and a wing of Big Pharma than anything it was originally intended to be.
The fact that the CDC has been exposed covering up dangers of vaccination as well as launching deceptive media campaigns for the stated purpose of instilling fear and anxiety to push vaccines is reason enough for the American people to have lost all faith in the CDC and to look at its “evidence” as biased as best and, at worst, entirely agenda-driven propaganda.
Dr. Boyer is right when they suggest a reasonable approach to the issue meaning doing the relevant research and actually waiting until the research has been conducted before making policy decisions on the issue. But we would also suggest another reasonable approach – conduct the research, analyze the results, disseminate the information and allow adults to decide what they put into their bodies.
Help Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.
Today I am launching a new recurring feature, “Great Urban Weekend Escapes,” along the lines of my semi-regular “Hotels I Love.”
I travel a lot and I talk to a lot of fellow travelers. Oddly, I know more people here in the States who have been to Paris, Rome and London than to Memphis, Austin or Charleston - all fabulous vacation destinations.
The problem with the world's most fabled vacation cities is that they require a lot of time. Visit New York or Florence for the very first time in just a weekend and you are going to miss more highlights than you are going to see. So in recent years, I have become a big fan of smaller - but no less welcoming - cities, those that make for perfect weekend or long weekend escapes. With the shorter amount of vacation time in America and our increasingly hectic, over-scheduled lives, a weekend getaway allows for a quick change of venue and recharge. Instead of the beach or countryside for a short escape, there are good reasons to visit a city: culture, entertainment, great food, and lots to do.
My basic rules for what makes a great weekend city include at least one standout attraction, be it a museum or something else, maybe Graceland or The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or The Alamo, something you have always wanted to see. It must have unique or diverse cuisine well worth eating, while natural attractions, great lodging and shopping are all pluses. As an added bonus, these cities are typically less expensive than their bigger counterparts even for the most luxurious lodgings, easier to get to with more functional airports close to downtown, and they are usually easy to get around.
If you live in one of these cities I feature, please take your selection as a complement. I'm not suggesting your hometown is only “worth” a couple of days. After all I live in a town whose entire population could fit inside the MGM Grand hotel in Vegas. Rather I'm saying your city is user-friendly enough to be enjoyed in a weekend - maybe the first of many weekend visits.
Indianapolis is at the top of my list because it combines so many surprising, high-profile attractions with true Midwestern hospitality, yet hardly anyone I know has visited as a tourist. They should. I wrote earlier this year about what a superlative job Indy did with the Super Bowl, one of the very best venues, in a way much larger cities like Dallas and New York can't hope to equal. This should come as little surprise, since the city has annually hosted the world's largest single one day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500, the mother of all auto races - for over a century. It is a bucket list sporting event to attend, but even if you never make it to the race, you can still enjoy the city's most famous attraction.
The legendary Indianapolis Motor Speedway, aka “The Brickyard,” is a must-visit sight any other day of the year. The museum here is open 364-days (closed Christmas) even during the Indy 500 and NASCAR's Brickyard 400, and on non-race days, offers visitors a ride around the fabled 2 ½ mile oval in a special shuttle. Inside is one of the world's greatest collections of rare and exotic cars, so many that they have to be rotated in and out of storage regularly, part of an ever changing display that also covers the history of the track and auto racing itself. On most days you can experience the thrill of speed with “hot laps” around the track, using an actual Indy car that has been modified with a second seat behind the driver, a pro racer who has actually competed in the Indy 500. The pull of centrifugal force in every turn is like nothing you have ever felt in a car. Or, if you prefer, you can even drive yourself!
Visiting golfers will be surprised to find that the Speedway is home to a world-class course by Indianapolis resident Pete Dye, the most awarded living designer. Brickyard Crossing, which used to host a Senior PGA event, is truly one-of-a-kind: four holes play inside the infield of the oval track, often with loud cars running by on test laps, linked by a tunnel to the fourteen holes just outside the stadium. The course is just one strop in Indiana's new Pete Dye Golf Trail.
But Indy is no one hit wonder – besides the Speedway, it is also home to the largest children museum in the world. With life-sized dinosaurs bursting through its exterior walls, The Children's Museum of Indianapolis is not just the biggest, it is consistently ranked the best of its kind in the U.S. (I wrote about the 12 Best Children's Museums in the country for Forbes.com). The Venice of the Midwest, Indy also has the fantastic 1 ½ mile Central Canal running right through downtown. This water and greenway is flanked with walking/biking/Segway paths, and offers rental kayaks, pedal boats and even gondolas, imported from, yes, Venice. And romance? Most people think the famous square, red LOVE statue seen in New York and Philadelphia comes from one of those museum-filled cities. Wrong. Those are just facsimiles of Robert Indiana's (really) famous four letter artwork - the 3-ton original is displayed on the 150-acre campus of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Numerous Olympic teams are based here, along with the headquarters of the NCAA, whose Hall of Champions museum features displays on all of the 23 competitive sports it sanctions that are played by American collegians.
Alexander Ralston, who designed the city, also helped lay out the plan for Washington, DC, which explains Indy's downtown circles and countless monuments.
Indy's compact downtown is super easy to navigate, and in its heart is the Circle Center Mall, where more than 100 shops are linked to a dozen major downtown hotels by enclosed walkways that are cool in summer and warm in winter, including the Westin, one of only three Conrad's in the country and the nation's largest JW Marriott, all good choices. At the opposite end of the size spectrum but high on charm is the 6-room Villa Inn, a city-style bed and breakfast in an Italianate brick mansion. The new 8-mile pedestrian and bike only Cultural Trail links the six major tourist neighborhoods, and nearly all the major attractions are on this path, including the Central Canal, with most downtown hotels offering bicycles.
No one goes home hungry from Indianapolis, where you'll find one of the nation's most iconic steakhouses, St. Elmo - which just won the 2012 James Beard Award as an American classic (I wrote about the historic eatery in detail for my USA Today Great American Bites column). True to its Midwestern roots, the city's most traditional meal is the fried pork tenderloin sandwich, and locals will debate endlessly which of the many places specializing in them are best. Try one. There is also a fast growing craft beer culture and Indy has jumped on the localvore trend, with many up and coming chefs here specializing in regional Midwestern produce and meats.
The city's excellent airport is less than four 3 years old, a $1.1 billion state of the art facility. There is actually a lot more stuff to see and do, without even attending one of the city's endless array of big time sporting events, but hey, that should be more than enough reasons to make a Great Urban Weekend Escape to Indianapolis.

An officer about 6:15 p.m. was traveling through a plaza in the 10400 block of South U.S. 1 and noticed a black-and-red Snapper lawnmower.
The lawnmower “was weaving and drifting almost in a zigzag pattern,” the affidavit states. The driver, identified as Alleshouse, was holding a case of Budweiser beer.
The officer stopped Alleshouse, and reported they smelled of booze. Alleshouse said their license was suspended following DUI-related charges.

Asked how much he'd imbibed, Alleshouse said, “Probably enough that I can drive the tractor.”
Police evidently disagreed, and administered field sobriety exercises.
Alleshouse, of the 2100 block of Southeast Abcor Road in Port St. Lucie, was arrested.
A breath test determined their blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit of 0.08.

Laia Martin's neighbour accuses them of causing psychological damage by practising the piano at home eight hours a day
A Spanish pianist is on trial and could face more than seven years in jail after a neighbour accused them of causing psychological damage and noise pollution.
The plaintiff, identified only as Sonia B because of tribunal regulations, claims they suffered from noise contamination between 2003 and 2007 owing to the eight-hour practice sessions, five days a week, of Laia Martin, who lived below them in a building in the north-eastern town of Puigcerdà.
Martin, 27, now a concert pianist, denies they played at home that often, saying they took regular classes in other towns.
El País newspaper reported that Sonia B told the court on Monday that they had eventually moved house, and now hated pianos.
The trial continued on Tuesday and is due to end on Friday.
The BATS are strong-willed, courageous teachers who are tired of being kicked around by politicians and their dumb ideas. They are “mad as hell” and they won't take it anymore.
Last year, after the BATS met with Arne Duncan, one of their leaders, Professor Yohuru Williams had the idea of convening an annual BATS Congress. That Congress recently met in Washington, D.C., had meetings with key legislators, held a sit-in at the office of Senator Bernie Sanders, and picketed the U.S. Department of Education.
“Prior to our two lobbying days, Washington BATs got us off to a great start by participating in a “Coffee with Constituents” session with Sen. Patty Murray. This group led the charge and let the legislators know that the Badass Teachers Association had descended upon “The Hill”. Over the course of the next two days, BATs from 20 states conducted over 61 appointments with their Federal Lawmakers. BATs shuffled from the House building to the Senate building over the course of these two days. Appointments started at 8 a.m. and lasted until 5 p.m.”
They met “The Walking Man” Jesse Turner as they concluded their 400-miles walk to D.C. to join with the other BATS.
They had three busy and productive days. It is valuable to have the BATS go to Washington. Otherwise our elected representatives would hear only from the big campaign contributors who are buying public education and elected officials like Cuomo and Malloy. The BATS made sure that teachers' concerns were well represented to the decision-makeres on Capitol Hill.
Thank you, BATS.
Christmas 1982. Liverpool leads the First Division by five points from Manchester United. Renée & Renato's Save Your Love, a 3min 6sec-sized cruise missile of an earworm – which still burrows into many worst-song-of-all-time lists – tops the charts. And, like many seven-year-old boys, almost everything I covet is in Shoot! magazine.
The Subbuteo Fifa World Cup Edition. A replica kit. Even, in weaker moments, the 100% cotton towelling robes in team colours – which, the advert promised, “makes a superb gift for all the family”.
Saturday's Guardian, in which my colleague Hilary Osborne unearthed a Boots catalogue from 1982 showing that a Ferguson video recorder cost £599 – or £1,863 at 2014 prices – brought memories scampering back. It also provided an excuse to crawl into the mustiest corners of my attic and dig through yellowing magazines to see how the price of football, from ticket prices to tat, has changed.
That Subbuteo edition, with Brazil's brooding Nelinho on the box lid, £28.95. Which, given the Office for National Statistics confirms that prices are 3.11 times higher now than in Christmas 1982 (when adjusted for inflation as measured by the retail prices index) equates to £90 today.

Those 100% cotton towelling robes? £20 after postage – or £62 in 2014 prices. Meanwhile, team quilt covers and pillowcases, beloved of many an 80s' pre-teen, were the equivalent of £67 today.
Football books were far from cheap, too. The Hamlyn Book of Football Techniques and Tactics by Richard Widdows “with 192 fully illustrated pages with approximately 200 colour illustrations” was £6.95 (£22). Yet videos were even pricier. A 60-minute film of España 82 cost £33.60 (£104) – extortionate given the average weekly wage in 1982 was £136.50 before tax.
But the biggest surprise was the cost of a football kit. I had assumed that prices went into overdrive during English football's post-Euro 96 gentrification period. Not so. One advert in Shoot! promising “top team replica strips” offered adult Manchester United home and away Adidas kits for £17.80 (£55), while Umbro's Arsenal, Liverpool and Brazil kits cost £18.95 (£59).
And Spurs' Le Coq Sportif kit, which Glenn Hoddle insisted was “just the thing to get me through a tough season – with all the style and staying power you'd expect from the foremost fashion sports company in the world”, cost a staggering £20.75, equivalent to £64 today.
True, in 1982 that bought shorts, socks and an official jersey. But the prices have not risen as much as I expected. A full Spurs kit in 2014, for instance, costs £78 - although Manchester United's is more at £82. An aside: in 1982 the biggest size was XL. Nowadays clubs offer 2XL and 3XL as standard.
I had also expected children's kits in 2014 to be comparatively more expensive than in 1982. In fact in some cases they are less. A Manchester United boys' kit in 1982 cost £13.50 (£42). In 2014 it is £38. Arsenal's strip, meanwhile, was £14.50 (£45) in 1982, while a mini-kit in 2014 will set parents back £40.
Yet when it came to ticket prices every hardened prejudice was confirmed. In The Economics of Football, the academics Stephen Dobson and John Goddard record the average cost to watch First Division football (the equivalent of today's Premier League) in 1982-83 as £2.55 – the equivalent of £7 in 2014 prices. No wonder, then, that there was outrage in December 1982 when the top-priced seat for England's match against Luxembourg was £13 (£40), with the cheapest at £7 (£22).
As a Shoot! editorial put it: “For the same price you could catch a return ferry from Folkestone to Boulogne, twice in a day. Or, if you're on a health kick, you could stock up the fridge with 65 pints of milk. The £13 would also buy two LPs with plenty of change, 81 Mars bars – or 18 pints of bitter.”

Still, tickets were still comparatively cheaper than the £25-£55 they were for adults at England's game against San Marino in October. Meanwhile in the Premier League, the cheapest Chelsea ticket is now £50. And while Hull, Leicester and West Ham do charge under £20 for some fixtures, simple supply and demand dictates that prices are likely to keep rising.
In the early 80s, the economics worked very differently. Football was broke. And with unemployment figures well above three million, many fans were too. A festering miasma of decrepit grounds and hooliganism hardly helped. Too often fans were treated like animals. Too often they behaved like them.
To raise money, some clubs delved outside the penalty box. Watford offered a special deal for overseas tourists – bed and breakfast and a ticket at £17 all-in. Torquay United made £1,000 from a target golf competition on their Plainmoor pitch and, as the Guardian reported, further boosted their bank balance by organising wrestling bouts and an antique fair.
Meanwhile, on Christmas Day 1982 I became one of football's new romantics when I was given my own kit. It was far from official: my parents bought a generic strip and stuck a badge on it. It was all they could afford, but I couldn't have cared less. There is a still a latent pride when I look at photos of me wearing it. Pride I doubt I'd feel if I had been given a cotton-towelling robe instead.
Pavel Malanik has been a very busy man engineering and machining the remaining components for the power plant that will be installed in their 1909 J. A. P. Engined Record Holder recreation since we last visited with him. In Part VI, we have many more construction photos and images of both sides of the completed 165.62 cubic inch (2,714 c.c.) engine.
The timing side of the finished product can be seen above with the drive side can be seen at the bottom of this post. You can follow the machining process of most of the remaining pieces needed to finish off the inside of the engine along with the rocker arms, pushrods and exhaust stacks here in this post.

Videos and photos being shared on social media appear to show a dramatic explosion in Tianjin, a city in northern China with a population of over 15 million people.
The images, which are emerging on Chinese Web sites like Sina Weibo, have not been independently confirmed by The Washington Post. However, Chinese state news agency Xinhua tweeted messages saying that there had been a "massive explosion" in the city, without providing more details.

Latest #Tianjin explanation from local media: flammable cargo exploded at port, setting off chain reactions. Now fears of chemical leak — Matt Simon (@MSimonTV) August 12, 2015
At the time of writing the scale of the injuries or deaths from the blast were not confirmed. Some Chinese outlets are reporting that local hospitals have received hundreds of patients. Photos being shared on Weibo appear to show considerable damage to peoples' homes from the blast.
The State Department announced Friday that it would halt its review of Hillary Clinton's classified emails, at the request of the FBI.
On the basic level, this is relatively routine. During the pendency of a criminal investigation, parallel civil investigations (like the State Department's) are often halted or stayed. The criminal investigation has preeminence, and a civil investigation would get in the way. This is standard, and does not say anything specific or significant about the nature of the criminal investigation.
For example, the criminal investigation and the State Department investigation might both want to question the same witnesses. Inevitably, small differences occur when the same witness is questioned twice, by different investigators operating in separately organizations. So, the criminal investigations usually prefer that no civil inquiries mess up the record by producing such versions.
But, there are subtleties in this particular investigation. A good deal of the case turns on how to view Clinton's emails, and the State Department might reach its own conclusions from going ahead with its own review that the FBI would find awkward. Generally speaking, the State Department knows from experience what its senior staff do as standard practice. They send emails among themselves that pass on information acquired from conversations with foreign diplomats or other public and private figures with whom they hold discussions.
Hundreds of such emails were sent to Clinton. Looking back long afterwards, although they were not marked classified, and were not put in State's system for classified information, these have been deemed, retroactively, to have classified information. And that is much of the case against them
Because the State Department is familiar with this, its pressing ahead with its own review might result in conclusions supportive of Clinton. It might describe much of the email exchanging as State Department “business as usual.” The State Department review might focus on how the vast majority of the emails came from others to her, and that they themselves wrote as little as five or six percent of all the ones now being retroactively deemed classified and hence mishandled.
A State Department conclusion of this kind would be a nuisance for the more hard-boiled FBI investigators. They do not want to acknowledge – at least not yet -- what is “business as usual” in the State Department. And, they do not want to acknowledge –at least not yet – that around 95% of the emails were written – and not marked classified, and sent through unclassified channels -- by all those other State Department officials, not Clinton.
Moreover, we do know this about the State Department review to date. Apparently some main focuses for it are the so-called 22 “top secret” (“special access program”) e-mails – these, too, were not marked classified, and were not put in State's system for classified information, but have been deemed this way retroactively. They are “so-called 22” because in fact they are only seven email chains, each of several emails.
Furthermore, of those seven “top secret” chains, most – it is not known how exactly many, but “most” of the seven may even be an understatement – concerned drone strikes, such as one controversial one in Pakistan that got brought to their attention by a diplomatic fracas. To the CIA and the FBI, this program is technically a sensitive compartmentalized one, and hence, even a mention of it gets retroactively classified “top secret.” But to the State Department, the drone program is so thoroughly in the public domain, and so extensively – and necessarily -- talked about with foreign diplomats and that like (including State's key role of defending and justifying them), that emails about such exchanges do not ring alarm bells at State like those for truly covert programs not so completely in the public domain.
A State Department review would surely put the email chains about the drones in perspective. And with most of the seven email chains thus dealt with, Clinton's so-called “top secret” emails could shrink down, as to the remaining arguably sensitive ones, to just 2 or 3 out of the seven – or maybe just 1 – on which they might have spent a single minute or less. A State Department conclusion of this kind would be a serious nuisance for FBI bitter-enders
So stopping the State Department review, blocks off one way that it might become generally understood that the realities of the State Department tend to exonerate Clinton.
Japan has successfully carried out the first test of its stealth jet.
TOKYO (Sputnik) – The plane took off from Nagoya Airfield (Komaki Airport) in Aichi Prefecture at around 08:50 a.m. local time on Friday (23:50 GMT on Thursday) and landed safely at Gifu Air Field in Gifu Prefecture at 09:13 a.m. (00:13 GMT), Defense Ministry Program Manager Hirofumi Doi told Bloomberg by phone.
Japan is now the fourth nation, after the United States, Russia and China to test fly its own stealth jet.
The plane cost about $366 million to develop, according to Japan's Defense Ministry. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. led the developers' team.
According to Doi, the ministry will study data from the Friday test flight and decide on further developments of the fifth generation stealth fighter.
Holographic "performances" by the likes of 2Pac and Michael Jackson have already broken laws of taste and decency, but a new show by a living artist appears to have fallen foul of the actual law. Chief Keef, a rapper with warrants out for their arrest related to child support disputes, attempted to beam a live hologram performance from California to Craze Fest in Hammond, Indiana on Saturday night, but police shut it down after around a minute, The New York Times reports.
Chief Keef's Craze Fest appearance was arranged after a Chicago hologram performance was called off following condemnation from Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office, calling the rapper an "unacceptable role model" who could present a "significant public safety risk" by appearing in virtual form. Chief Keef initially planned to hold the show in downtown Chicago on Saturday night, but reportedly later announced the new location over Instagram.
Chicago called the hologram a "significant public safety risk."
"I know nothing about Chief Keef," Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott told the Times. "All I'd heard was they have a lot of songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that's anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He's been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we're not going to let you circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door."
"No one ever gave me a reason why they didn't want the hologram to appear," said Craze Fest promoter Malcolm Jones. "They didn't have a real reason. They believed that it would start trouble, but the first thing Chief Keef said via hologram was: ‘Chicago, we need to stop the violence. Let our kids live.'"
Mr Milford met their wife Anita, both 101, at a YMCA dance in Plymouth, Devon, in 1926 and they married two years later.
The couple said the secret of their marriage was "give and take", always making up after rows and never going to bed without a kiss and cuddle.
Mr Milford's 76-year-old son, also called Frank, said their mother was holding their father's hand when they died.
They said: "She's very upset obviously, but they were sitting holding their hand when they passed away.
"For the past three weeks or so they haven't been eating or drinking and I think we all realised they were ready to die.
"He knew it was their time and I think they simply died of old age
The younger Mr Milford said their father had remained "as sharp as a tack" despite their frailty and never lost their sense of humour.
The Milfords spent their entire married life in Plymouth and stayed in the city throughout World War II.
During the Blitz they narrowly escaped two bombs, including one which fell on their house.
The devoted couple had two children, five grandchildren and seven great grandchildren.
In February 2010 the couple would have broken the record to become the oldest married couple in Britain.
The majority of child sexual abuse cases are taking place in areas with significant Asian populations, a new report has found. Figures revealed by Freedom of Information requests lodged with every police force in England show that London, Manchester and West Yorkshire have the highest rates of incidents. Another study claimed that White and Asian people took the number one and two slots amongst perpetrators.
The National Society for the Prevention of Child Cruelty (NSPCC) lodged the FOI requests as part of it's fact finding exercise for it's third annual state of the nations's children report. The figures show that there were a total of 31,238 sexual offences against under 18 year olds recorded between 1st April 2013 and 31st March 2014, an increase of 40 percent on the previous year.
The majority of these – 11.28 percent – were recorded by the London Metropolitan police. Also high on the list were Greater Manchester Police, which recorded 5.84 percent of cases, West Yorkshire Police, which recorded 4.92 percent of cases, and West Midlands Police, recording 4.37 percent of cases.
West Yorkshire Police cover an area which includes Bradford, Leeds, and Wakefield, whilst West Midlands Police serves Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton.
The total figure represents 85 cases a day including rape, sexual assault, and grooming being reported to police nationwide. The majority of cases involved children aged 12-18, although 2,895 involved children aged five or younger – including 94 babies.
Each of these areas include significant Asian, predominantly Muslim populations. The 2011 census showed that the Muslim population in London had risen to 12.4 percent of the capital's total, and that 40 percent of England's Muslims live within London alone.
Likewise, Birmingham City Council has found that 21.8 percent of the city's residents are Muslim, outnumbering the proportion of people who are of no religion. In Bradford, the Muslim population is so significant that George Galloway was able to win election on a pro-Islam ticket in a 2012 by-election. They later attempted to ban Israelis from the city.
Yet despite the revelation made last year that Pakistani gangs had systematically groomed and abused 1,400 children in Rotherham alone over a 16 year period, the NSPCC makes no mention of the scourge of Pakistani sex gangs in it's report. Although it's website does include a section on child grooming by gangs, it makes no mention of Rotherham, instead blandly asserting that “We don't know a great deal about who commits child sexual exploitation.”
It also cites a study by the Children's Commissioner in order to insist: “Where ethnic group was recorded, the majority of perpetrators were White and the second largest group were Asian.”
That study, undertaken in 2012 before the Rotherham scandal was made known, draws on limited information and reveals an unwillingness to believe the victims' testimonies as to the ethnicity of the perpetrators, saying: “Data on the ethnicity of perpetrators are considerably less reliable than that supplied on age or gender. Ethnicity and nationality were sometimes confused. Unless a perpetrator had actually been arrested, it was difficult to be sure whether or not their ethnicity had been correctly identified.
“In addition, professionals adopted a range of methods for capturing data on ethnicity, and often used broad headings such as ‘Asian' or ‘White' to capture individuals.”
Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, has said of their organisation's report: “These startling figures must not be ignored. As our report shows, the challenges in keeping future generations safe are myriad and complex.”
They believe that it is the government's duty to do more to intervene in family life, in order to prevent a tsunami of abuse: “From the leap in young people being referred to social services, to the number of sexual offences being recorded against children, it is clear that society and government needs to ‘up the ante' and ensure tackling child abuse is a top priority,” they said.
Yet this explanation ignores the rise in government interference in family life. Earlier this month, a toddler, known as ‘AB' was reported to have been removed from their family home and put up for adoption against the wish of their loving parents – because they were heavy smokers.
Similarly, 74 children are reported to have been taken into care between 2009 and 2014, purely because they were obese. Tam Fry, chairperson of the Child Growth Foundation and spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum, last year said that parents allowing their children to become obese constituted “child neglect and abuse”
And in a highly alarming case which made international news last year, Portsmouth Council applied for an emergency protection order to seize control of Ashya King, a five year old brain tumour sufferer, because their parents took them to Europe for life saving treatment against the wishes of the National Health Service (NHS).
Ashya's parents were tracked across Europe by police to Spain, where they were arrested and held for a week until public outcry became such that the British authorities dropped their demand for extradition. Only then were the family were allowed to continue on to seek treatment for Ashya.
Meanwhile, while the NSPCC is keen to publicise the 80 percent increase in child custody cases, it makes little mention of the fact that very few of these cases result in criminal charges of cruelty or neglect.
According to the NSPCC, 570,800 children were referred to social services in 2013/14, equivalent to approximately one in every 24 children. Yet police forces across Britain recorded 9,516 cruelty and neglect offences against under 16s in the same period; meaning that just 1.7 percent of referrals were sufficiently serious to warrant police action.
We were off to the races and I thought to myself hold tight
I have to admit, I was a little nervous the last two days before the Athletics Canada Olympic team announcement (July 11). Over the past few months I told myself I was going to be named as a strategy to avert stress and it worked like a charm… up until the last couple of days. So when I got an email from Peter Ericsson on July 11th saying that I was going to be named to the Rio team it was a big relief.
Over the last few weeks my training and recovery from injury has gone as well as expected. My paces in sessions are improving and I feel more normal each week. I knew the path to healthy running wouldn't be a linear progression, there are always bumps along the way. However, those bumps have been relatively minor (so far). The week after I moved into my new house my back was tight (not a big surprise) and I cut a 70 minute tempo at 66 minutes, so yeah very minor setbacks.
The day before the team was announced I was in Utica, NY racing the Boilermaker 15km. Once again Marie and I made a little road trip out of it and stopped at Green Lakes State Park on the way. The trails right around the lake are perfect for a short pre-race run and nothing better than a quick dip on a hot day.
DCIM100GOPRO DCIM100GOPRO DCIM100GOPRO
Boilermaker was a ‘good enough' result for me, I finished 12th (top non-African again) in 45:23. Admittedly I wanted to be top 10 and under 45:00. The field was a little deeper this year because of a prize money bonus at the PRRO Circuit finale and the times a bit slower due to wind. Off the start the pace was slow because no one wanted to lead into the wind. Like last year I ran with the pack but we were 31 seconds slower over the first 3km compared to 2015!
This time around I lost the pack around 4km because of a nasty surge but I caught back up to them by 5km. I lost the pack halfway up the big hill and from 6km to the finish pressed the pace alone. I did have company for the final 4km but Girma (I had trained with them in Auburn years ago) simply sat on me until the final 300m. My split from 10 to 15km was slightly faster this year than last year.
In general my legs felt a little heavy but considering I was coming off three 190+km weeks in a row they felt pretty good, no complaints there. I wouldn't have got the same effort in training so it was nice to step up the intensity a bit six weeks out from Rio.

In the past 6 days I've been drug tested twice at home. This is typical heading into a major competition as most countries want to make sure they are sending a clean team. They up the tests heading into World Championships and Olympic Games.
On Saturday evening the testers came for urine and were in and out in about 20 minutes. On Wednesday the testers came around 8:15am for urine and blood. I had already peed that morning so I wasn't sure what I had in the tank. I was able to pee right away but only produced about 70ml. They ask for 100ml but can get away with 90ml.
I drank three bottles of water and waited until I felt I could pee again. After a while I was pretty sure I could go, but I couldn't squeeze out a drop. I tried the trick of putting the tap on to hear the sound of water, still nothing. Waited a little longer then tried again, still nothing. I knew why too, I had to take a #2 and my body wouldn't relax my peeing mechanism knowing that I might crap my pants.
I explained the situation to the testers and they said this thing happens and the chaperone will have to watch you as you pee in the cup sitting on the toilet. I told them I could go #2 and hold my pee and then pee into the cup later. They seemed impressed with that skill, noting that most people have to do both at once. However, I still had to be under surveillance while I took a #2.
Taking a crap in front of someone is only slightly humbling. Wiping your butt in front of someone is when it gets weird (avoid eye contact helps). Anyways, I was able to pee right after and get that portion of the drug test done. After that I had blood drawn.
I really don't mind the testing and the protocol the testers have to follow knowing that it helps keep the sport clean. I described the testing to give you guys an idea of what is involved and the funny stories that come out of it.
A little later I went on a 16km run and stopped about 5 times to take a pee.
***
Many people ask me what day I leave for Rio and are surprised to hear I'm not leaving until August 15th. It's an overnight flight that will put Eric and me in the village on the 16th, five days before our competition. This is good for us as we can do our hard training without the interruption of travel and once we taper take the 10 hour flight. Also, we don't want to be in the village too long before our race as it's a little overwhelming being immersed into the village where the Olympics are in your face 24/7. It's nice to have time away from the big event.
Another question that comes up on Strava when I do a hard session is if that particular run was the last big one. Our biggest session will actually come next week, about 3.5 weeks before the race. It will consist of 80-90 minutes of continuous running close to or at marathon pace. My taper won't truly begin until the final 10 days. After this week I'll cut my volume down each week a little but it will still be solid until the last 10 days.

South of the Border is a 2009 documentary film directed by Oliver Stone.
The documentary premiered at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. Writer for the project Tariq Ali calls the documentary a political road movie.
Stone stated that they hope the film will help people better understand a leader who is wrongly ridiculed as a strongman, as a buffoon, as a clown.
The film has Stone and their crew travel from the Caribbean down the spine of the Andes in an attempt to explain the phenomenon of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, and account for the continent's pink tide leftward tilt.
A key feature is also Venezuela's recent Bolivarian revolution and Latin America's political progress in the 21st century.
In addition to Chávez, Stone sought to flesh out several other Latin American presidents whose policies and personalities generally get limited, or according to Stone, biased media attention in the United States and Europe, notably: Evo Morales of Bolivia; Cristina Kirchner and former president Nestor Kirchner of Argentina; Rafael Correa of Ecuador; Raúl Castro of Cuba; Fernando Lugo of Paraguay; and Lula da Silva of Brazil.

Now what? Did you think that the United States had finally grown up and come to the realization that they could in fact share the same hemisphere as the people of Cuba, accepting Cuban society as unquestioningly as they do that of Canada? The Washington Post (February 18) reported: “In recent weeks, administration officials have made it clear Obama would travel to Cuba only if its government made additional concessions in the areas of human rights, Internet access and market liberalization.”
Imagine if Cuba insisted that the United States make “concessions in the area of human rights”; this could mean the United States pledging to not repeat anything like the following:
Invading Cuba in 1961 at the Bay of Pigs.
Invading Grenada in 1983 and killing 84 Cubans, mainly construction workers.
Blowing up a passenger plane full of Cubans in 1976. (In 1983, the city of Miami held a day in honor of Orlando Bosch, one of the two masterminds behind this awful act; the other perpetrator, Luis Posada, was given lifetime protection in the same city.)
Giving Cuban exiles, for their use, the virus which causes African swine fever, forcing the Cuban government to slaughter 500,000 pigs.
Infecting Cuban turkeys with a virus which produces the fatal Newcastle disease, resulting in the deaths of 8,000 turkeys.
In 1981 an epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever swept the island, the first major epidemic of DHF ever in the Americas. The United States had long been experimenting with using dengue fever as a weapon. Cuba asked the United States for a pesticide to eradicate the mosquito involved but were not given it. Over 300,000 cases were reported in Cuba with 158 fatalities.
These are but three examples of decades-long CIA chemical and biological warfare (CBW) against Cuba. We must keep in mind that food is a human right (although the United States has repeatedly denied this.
Washington maintained a blockade of goods and money entering Cuba that is still going strong, a blockade that President Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, in 1997 called “the most pervasive sanctions ever imposed on a nation in the history of humankind”.
Attempted to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro on numerous occasions, not only in Cuba, but in Panama, Dominican Republic and Venezuela.
In one scheme after another in recent years, Washington's Agency for International Development (AID) endeavored to cause dissension in Cuba and/or stir up rebellion, the ultimate goal being regime change.
In 1999 a Cuban lawsuit demanded $181.1 billion in US compensation for death and injury suffered by Cuban citizens in four decades “war” by Washington against Cuba. Cuba asked for $30 million in direct compensation for each of the 3,478 people it said were killed by US actions and $15 million each for the 2,099 injured. It also asked for $10 million each for the people killed, and $5 million each for the injured, to repay Cuban society for the costs it has had to assume on their behalf.
Needless to say, the United States has not paid a penny of this.
One of the most common Yankee criticisms of the state of human rights in Cuba has been the arrest of dissidents (although the great majority are quickly released). But many thousands of anti-war and other protesters have been arrested in the United States in recent years, as in every period in American history. During the Occupy Movement, which began in 2011, more than 7,000 people were arrested in about the first year, many were beaten by police and mistreated while in custody, their street displays and libraries smashed to pieces. ; the Occupy movement continued until 2014; thus, the figure of 7,000 is an understatement.)
Moreover, it must be kept in mind that whatever restrictions on civil liberties there may be in Cuba exist within a particular context: The most powerful nation in the history of the world is just 90 miles away and is sworn – vehemently and repeatedly sworn – to overthrowing the Cuban government. If the United States was simply and sincerely concerned with making Cuba a less restrictive society, Washington's policy would be clear-cut:
*Call off the wolves – the CIA wolves, the AID wolves, the doctor-stealer wolves, the baseball-player-stealer wolves. *Publicly and sincerely (if American leaders still remember what this word means) renounce their use of CBW and assassinations. And apologize. *Cease the unceasing hypocritical propaganda – about elections, for example. (Yes, it's true that Cuban elections never feature a Donald Trump or a Hillary Clinton, nor ten billion dollars, nor 24 hours of campaign ads, but is that any reason to write them off?) *Pay compensation – a lot of it. *Sine qua non – end the God-awful blockade.
Throughout the period of the Cuban revolution, 1959 to the present, Latin America has witnessed a terrible parade of human rights violations – systematic, routine torture; legions of “disappeared” people; government-supported death squads picking off selected individuals; massacres en masse of peasants, students and other groups. The worst perpetrators of these acts during this period have been the military and associated paramilitary squads of El Salvador, Guatemala, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Uruguay, Haiti and Honduras. However, not even Cuba's worst enemies have made serious charges against the Havana government for any of such violations; and if one further considers education and health care, “both of which,” said President Bill Clinton, “work better [in Cuba] than most other countries” , and both of which are guaranteed by the United Nations “Universal Declaration of Human Rights” and the “European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms”, then it would appear that during the more-than-half century of its revolution, Cuba has enjoyed one of the very best human-rights records in all of Latin America.
But never good enough for American leaders to ever touch upon in any way; the Bill Clinton quote being a rare exception indeed. It's a tough decision to normalize relations with a country whose police force murders its own innocent civilians on almost a daily basis. But Cuba needs to do it. Maybe they can civilize the Americans a bit, or at least remind them that for more than a century they have been the leading torturers of the world.
Looking to get in the win column in the UFC for the first time, Norifumi "Kid" Yamamoto will have to wait a while longer.The Japanese legend made their UFC debut in February, losing a unanimous decision against Demetrious Johnson in a fight "Mighty Mouse" dominated with takedowns. Yamamoto was expected to face Chris Cariaso at UFC 130 next month, but the UFC reported Wednesday an injury has forced them off the card.Stepping in to fight Cariaso in the bantamweight bout will be Michael McDonald on less than five weeks notice. The fight is expected to take place as part of UFC 130's preliminary card.Yamamoto (18-4, 1 NC, 0-1 UFC), long considered one of the world's top featherweights, has lost three of their last four fights, including their drop to bantamweight in their long-awaited UFC debut and first fight in the United States in nearly eight years. The UFC did not disclose the nature of the injury.McDonald (12-1, 1-0 UFC), the UFC's youngest fighter at 20, fought just one month ago at UFC Fight Night 24 in Seattle, winning a unanimous decision over Edwin Figueroa – and a Fight of the Night bonus in the process. It was their UFC debut after debuting in the WEC in November with a submission win over Clint Godfrey.Cariaso (11-2, 1-0 UFC) went 1-1 in the WEC before moving to the UFC following the promotions' merger last fall. In their UFC debut in January, they won a unanimous decision against Will Campuzano at the Fight for the Troops 2 show at Fort Hood, Texas.UFC 130 has seen several fight changes, most notably to the co-main event light heavyweight bout between Quinton "Rampage" Jackson and Thiago Silva. Silva's positive steroid test forced them off the card; they were replaced by Matt Hamill. Last week, Brad Pickett pulled out of their fight with former bantamweight champion Miguel Torres and was replaced by Johnson. Johnson's original opponent, Renan Barao, then got a new foe – Cole Escovedo.UFC 130: Edgar vs. Maynard 3 takes place May 28 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, featuring a main event trilogy rematch between lightweight champion Frankie Edgar and Gray Maynard, who fought to a rare title bout draw at UFC 125 in January.

Tricho System In the early 1920's the Tricho System used x-rays to remove superfluous hair. By 1925 there were over 75 installations of the Tricho machines in beauty shops across the country including Minneapolis and Duluth. These 'studios' used direct x-rays focused on th cheek and upper lip of the woman who wanted to permanently remove superfluous hair. Women had an average of 20 treatments each. A single large dose or smaller doses repeated over long periods of time could cause damage to tissues that were not noticeable at the time but often came to light years after the administration of the Roentgen rays. This injury often became manifest as pigmentation, wrinkling atrophy, keratoses, ulcerations, carcinoma, and death. In 1929, the AMA alerted its members to Tricho injuries and collected dozens of case studies - most of the victims were young women, ages 18-30. Reports of women injured by Tricho treatments appeared in the medical journals into the 1940's. The Tricho was marketed as an award-winning innovation. The Grand Prize which Tricho was 'awarded' was sold by one Max Kaiser of London who, beginning 1914, began to sell them to anyone for $400. Mr. Kaiser made arrangements for a manufacturer's exhibit at one of the numerous "International Exhibitions" of the times. Further, they practically guaranteed that this exhibit would receive either a "grand prize" or "gold medal." In fact, the manufacturer wasn't required to pay Mr. Kaiser's fee until the prize or medal had been awarded. The Tricho's prizes were won at the Paris Exposition Generale Commercial on October 19, 1925. Excerpts from Tricho Literature All normal women desire to be beautiful, or at least to attaint the highest degree of beauty that can be achieved by any practical means. Impelled by this desire, great numbers of women have resorted to futile, dangerous and injurious means of removing disfiguring superfluous hair. It was the existence of such conditions that impelled Albert C. Geyser, M.D., to devote their knowledge and ability to the perfecting of a practically safe and thoroughly effective method of removing superfluous hair hair. That they were entirely successful in this is shown by the fact that in the course of the past six years, in New York City alone, 20,000 areas of superfluous hair have been cleared permanently, and without a single failure. Equal success has been achieved in thousands of cases throughout the country, by means of this Tricho System of Treatment. ALBERT C. GEYSER, M.D., Medical Director of the Tricho System, Formerly
Professor of Physiological Therapy and Chief of Clinic at
Fordham University; Lecturer and Chief of Electro and
Roentgenray Clinic at Cornell College; Lecturer and Chief
of the Electro and Radio Therapy Clinic at the New York
Polyclinic, Etc. Everybody knows that success and happiness in life have been denied to multitudes of otherwise lovely women through growths of disfiguring hair, and that mental distress suffered in consequence has served to break the health of many. It is generally known, also, that various treatments with chemicals, wax, electricity and other methods frequently have produced effects worse than those they were intended to correct. Many years ago the discovery was made that the X-ray would destroy hair roots, preventing further growth. It was found, however, that serious injury might be cause by S-ray treatment for this purpose. Albert C. Geyser, M.D., internationally famous X-ray expert and lecturer on radiology in various universities, devoted themselves to the perfecting of means to make the X-Ray treatment as save and harmless as it was effective, and in this they were brilliantly successful. The Tricho System of Treatment is the result. This dries up the hair roots in a manner similar to that of gradually getting bald, instead of attempting their sudden and violent destruction.
Tricho System Endorsed by the Medical Profession The apparatus of the TRICHO SYSTEM and the technic of its operation have been examined by many leading physicians, all of whom have endorsed the method. The attitude of the medical profession is well illustrated by the fact that Tricho treatments have been given to the wives, daughters and sisters of physicians.
SUMMARY
1. TRICHO SYSTEM removes superfluous hair permanently. 6. No scars or other injury to the most delicate skin. 2. No pain-no inconvenience. Treatments are void of any sensation whatever. 7. All treatments given by operators trained under personal supervision of Albert C. Geyser, M.D. 3. Treatments last but a few minutes. 8. Endorsed by physicians and beauty experts. 4. Treatments given not oftener than every two weeks. 9. Scientific-safe-sure. 5. Fifteen treatments sufficient in the great majority of cases. 10. Permanent removal of superfluous hair guaranteed.
The main establishment of the Tricho System of Treatment, presided over by Dr. Geyser, is at 270 Madison avenue, New York City. There are Tricho System establishments also in Akron, O.; Albany, N.Y.; Baltimore, Md.; Boston, Mass.; Bridgeport, Conn.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Chicago, Ill.; Cincinnati, O.; Columbus, O.; Denver, Col.; Des Moines, Ia.; Detroit, Mich.; Duluth, Minn.; Evansville, Ind.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Hartford, Conn.; Holyoke, Mass.; Indianapolis, Ind.; Jersey City, N.J..; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles, Cal.; Milwaukee, Wisc.; Minneapolis, Minn.; Montreal, Canada; Newark, N.J.; New Haven, Conn.; Omaha, Neb.; Paterson, N.J.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Pittsburg, Pa.; Portland, Ore.; Poughkeepsie, N.

THE trouble with water is that it is all politics, no economics. The costs of poor management are large: groundwater depletion takes 2.1% off Jordan's GDP; water pollution and scarcity knock 2.3% off China's; 11% of Kenya's was lost to flooding in 1997-98, and 16% to drought in the next two years. Rich countries build sewers, drains, dams, reservoirs, flood defences, irrigation canals and barrages to avoid such problems. Poor countries, with some exceptions, notably China, find large projects much more difficult. But at least large projects give politicians a monument to boast about. Small projects—weirs and wells and waterworks—have no allure for big-headed politicians.
That is a pity. A small dam is relatively cheap to construct: modest reservoirs known in India as tanks used to be built and maintained by local villagers. For a millennium they provided water in times of need and helped make rulers like the nizams of Hyderabad some of the richest men in the world. Now they are often silted up, polluted with pesticides, metals and phosphorus, or built on. In Kenya, by contrast, small dams are coming into fashion. Rainwater is channelled into sand catchments, which serve both to filter it and to protect it from evaporation. Some goes into nearby soil, for crops, some into groundwater from which it can later be recovered. In Niger a 15-year project involving dams and reclamation has restored nearly 20,000 hectares of unproductive land to forestry or agricultural use.
Everyone loves projects like these, especially if they can be given a romantic name like water harvesting. Some, perhaps, may simply be intercepting water for one user that would otherwise have gone to another, but almost every country could reduce its evaporation losses by capturing water and delivering it more effectively to the farmer, bather, drinker or manufacturer—and then, ideally, using it again. The harder question is whether that is enough.
Many believe it is not. Throughout history, man has made efforts to control water, divert it by means of canals, carry it via aqueducts, store it in reservoirs, harness it with water wheels and so on. The costs of these endeavours have been huge: valleys flooded, villages and habitats destroyed, wetlands drained and inland seas reduced to mere puddles. But the benefits have also been enormous.
The Aswan high dam, for example, is often cited as a cautionary example, a quixotic construction that now reduces the mighty Nile to a dribble before it trickles to the sea, leaving behind an explosion of water hyacinth, outbreaks of bilharzia, polluted irrigation channels and a build-up of sediment inland that would otherwise compensate for coastal erosion from Egypt to Lebanon. Yet, according to the World Bank, it has provided a bulwark against flooding for buildings and crops, a huge expansion of farming and Nile navigation (lots of tourism) and enough electricity for the whole of Egypt—all of which amounts to the equivalent each year of 2% of GDP in net benefits.
So would the World Bank today lend money for an Aswan dam if it did not already exist? The bank has been involved in few of the 200 or so large dams built in the past five years, but that is mainly because dam-builders—of which China is much the biggest—do not care for the bank's time- and money-consuming regulations, designed to ensure decent technical, social and environmental standards. Their strictness partly reflects greater knowledge about the consequences of building dams, partly the related political controversies of the 1980s. Even so, the bank was involved in 101 dam and hydro projects in 2007, up from 89 in 1997 and 76 in 2003; and it approved over $800m in hydro lending in 2008, up from $250m in 2002.
Suspicions of big dams still run high—and with some reason. Mr Thakkar, scrutineer of the Indian water scene, says that although the installed capacity of India's hydro projects increased at a compound rate of 4.4% a year between 1991 and 2005, the amount of energy generated actually fell. Some of the projects, poorly sited or poorly designed, were doomed to be uneconomic from the start. Others have been badly maintained or have simply silted up. But though 89% of the country's hydro projects operate below design capacity, the building continues wastefully apace.
Mr Thakkar argues that small projects offer much better returns, even for the crucial task of refilling aquifers by capturing monsoon rainfall. They point to the success of micro-irrigation in semi-arid Gujarat, whose agriculture has grown at an average of 9.6% a year since the turn of the century, partly thanks to the creation of 500,000 small ponds, dams and suchlike. But India, says Mr Thakkar, is still obsessed with big projects like the Bhakhra dam that the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, saw as one of the “temples” of Indian modernity. Only when the small temples can no longer provide solutions do they see a need for big ones.
Not all the big temples are dams. India has a dormant but not dead $120 billion scheme to bring “surplus” water from north to south by linking up the country's main rivers. China has its south-north equivalent, which, if it comes to pass, may involve spending $62 billion and shifting 250,000 people. Spain had its Ebro scheme, involving 830km of waterways, now abandoned, though some Spaniards remain wistful. Each of these has, or had, beguiling attractions, but vast costs.
Dams and reservoirs certainly need constant repairs and careful maintenance and do not always get them, usually because the necessary institutions are not in place. But when they are, a well-sited dam or embankment can transform lives for the better. In the late 1970s John Briscoe, an old water hand at the World Bank who is now at Harvard, spent a year in a Bangladeshi village and predicted terrible consequences if a proposed flood-control and irrigation scheme were to go ahead. It did, but on their return 22 years later they found the new embankment had vastly improved every aspect of the villagers' lives. They became an advocate of large projects.
In the rich world these are now largely unnecessary; the damage has been done and the benefits are being reaped. Southern California is an example, a region that gets all its water expensively from either the north of the state or the Colorado, a river so dammed and drained that it dies long before it reaches its delta—7,500 square kilometres of wetlands formerly crammed with wildlife, now invaded by the salty Pacific. But Hollywood survives, and in it such environmentalists as James Cameron, the director of “Avatar” and new champion of the Amazonian opponents of the planned Belo Monte dam in Brazil.
Many Ethiopians would be happy to have a few dams. Their GDP rises and falls in near synch with their rainfall, which varies wildly from year to year. If they had more storage, they could use it to get through the country's frequent droughts, but their human-made storage amounts to only 30 cubic metres per person, compared with 6,000 in the United States. Ethiopia's electricity consumption per person is among the lowest in the world, whereas its potential for hydro power is one of the highest. Indeed, electricity could be a valuable export.
Africa as a whole stands to benefit from more hydro projects, large and small. Climate change seems likely to shorten the rainy seasons and intensify variability, making storage even more important. Moreover, Africa seems likely to suffer more from climate change than other continents. As it is, it contains 35 of the 45 most “water-stressed” countries.
Hydro generation uses a known and tested technology that neither adds directly to greenhouse gases nor produces nuclear waste. Last month the World Bank announced a controversial $3.75 billion loan for a coal-fired plant in South Africa. Some hydro projects might be no more unpopular. Congo's Inga dams, for example, have the potential to provide the equivalent of South Africa's existing capacity. The South African authorities would be pleased to have it today. Their fingers are crossed that the hydro power from Mozambique will not cut out during the football World Cup next month.
It has taken 40 years, but researchers have finally unlocked a key mystery in processor technology. In late April, computer scientists at HP Labs found a fourth fundamental circuit element, which has so far existed only in theory. This circuit could act as the ultimate virtual bookmark, remembering your settings and exact place even when you power off.
The technology breakthrough is based on a concept developed in the 1970s by Leon Chua, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley. Chua reasoned that along with the three existing circuit elementsresistor, capacitor, and inductorthere could be a fourth type called a "memory resistor." Chua's theory was published in an academic paper and ever since has been a lofty-yet-elusive goal for computer science engineers.
Until now. HP Labs' Information and Quantum Systems Lab team published an article in the journal Nature that presented a mathematical model and physical example of its version of a memory resistor, which the team dubbed a "memristor." According to HP Labs team leader R. Stanley Williams, the memristor will be able to retain a complete history of the information it has acquiredan exciting prospect, they say.
"To find something new and yet so fundamental in the mature field of electrical engineering is a big surprise, and one that has significant implications for the future of computer science," Williams said in a statement released by HP.
Currently, computers use DRAM (dynamic random access memory) to recompile settings when you boot up. A processor with memristor technology could have a hand in jump-starting the trend of "cloud computing" (see "Living in the Cloud," page 19). To make cloud computing a reality requires Web servers with significantly increased processing power and storage capacity to retain, deliver, and protect user data. A memristor processor could greatly improve the ability of servers to perform cloud-computing functions because they would require no "reboots" to pick up where users left off at their previous computing session.
The lack of a clear law on space property rights hasn't stopped one man from selling real estate on the moon — and the other solar system bodies as well.
Entrepreneur Dennis Hope of Gardnerville, Nev., has sold millions of acres of property on the moon, Mars, and other heavenly worlds through their company Lunar Embassy Corp., Good Morning America reported this week. Yet many legal experts question whether such deeds would ever hold up in court. "As far as title goes, it's a gray area," international lawyer and space-law expert Timothy Nelson, who works for the firm Skadden in New York City, told SPACE.com in 2011.
The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 forbids countries from claiming territorial sovereignty over the moon or other celestial bodies. It doesn't, however, expressly forbid private companies from staking claims, Hope points out. Whether that argument would hold up to legal scrutiny is unclear, but the uncertainty hasn't stopped Hope from selling space land parcels since 1968. An acre on the moon goes for $19.99, while the same size plot on Mars will set you back $22.49, plus tax and shipping and handling. Hope claims to have sold 7.5 percent of the moon so far, so other lunar land grabbers might want to hurry up, before there's no more room for moon McMansions.

A report conducted by the Taskforce on Preserving Medical Professionalism in National Security Detention Centers concludes that in the wake of 9/11 health professionals operating with military and intelligence services “designed and participated in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees”. This torture included force-feeding of prisoners on hunger strikes, breaching patient confidentiality, and failing to report abuse done to the detainees.
The CIA required staff participants not to think about their principles but rather intelligence gathering and security practices, often calling them “safety officers” rather than doctors. Taskforce member and Columbia University emeritus medical professor Dr. Gerald Thomson notes that Americans need to know a physician's professional ethics should be consistent regardless of who they work for. “It's clear that in the name of national security the military trumped that covenant, and physicians were transformed into agents of the military and performed acts that were contrary to medical ethics and practice,” Thomson said. “We have a responsibility to make sure this never happens again.”

When Parliament resumes in Canberra this year, newly-elected Federal MPs Linda Burney and Anne Aly will walk into the Lower House representing two significant firsts.
Member for Barton Linda Burney will be the first Indigenous woman sitting in the House of Reps.
And Dr Anne Aly, professor at Edith Cowan University in WA and expert in counter-terrorism, will be walking through the doors as the member for Cowan and the first Muslim woman in Parliament.
Both women have won Labor seats this election that were previously held by Liberal MPs. And both have now joined Hack host Tom Tilley in the studio for their Let's Talk™ appointments.
Here's what we learned about Anne Aly at the beginning of their career in Federal politics.
They didn't expect to become a politician
On ABC's Q&A last year, Dr Anne Aly said that part of a politician's job was learning how to “lie”.
Anne Aly told Hack that they hope to prove their own criticism wrong.
“Well I'm hoping that I'm not going to be one of those politicians,” Dr Aly said.
“If you had said to me back then that I was going to have a career in politics I would have said ‘no way, not touching it with a ten foot pole'. But it did get to a situation in the work that I do where it got to the point where I just thought, 'I need to make change from the inside, something needs to change.'
“And what needs to change is political will. And the offer came up to run for this seat, it was a marginal seat, and I thought, 'maybe this is a sign? Maybe I can make change from the inside'.”
Supports taking away passports from people intending to fight overseas
Anne Aly has previously criticised the Government's plan to take passports away from Australians intending to fight overseas, saying local intervention after-the-fact would be needed.
“I never thought it was a bad idea, I think it's a good thing to take away the passports,” Anne Aly said on Hack.
“What my criticism of that is, that if you take away the passports, all very well and good but let's have something in place for those that are left here. Because they can't travel and those who have a pathway to violence, and ensuring that that pathway to violence isn't then turned to violence within Australia. And indeed that's what we've seen, if you look at the arrests over the past couple years of young people who are planning terrorist attacks.
"And most of them, if not all of them have had their passports taken away. So it's all very well and good to have their passports taken away, yes we can absolutely support that, but let's look at where there are gaps, and the gaps that that creates. And develop interventions and programs to fill those gaps.”
They expect to face off with Pauline Hanson
Is Anne Aly excited about the prospect of sharing the corridors of power with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who has called for a royal commission into Islam?
“I don't know about ‘excited' about it, I don't know about 'excited', Tom,” Anne Aly said.
But does Anne Aly expect to face off with Pauline Hanson in Parliament?
“I'm sure we will. I'm actually looking forward to it, because you know, if enough Australians have voted for One Nation to be in the Senate, then it certainly means that people want this discussed.
“So let's have the discussion, let's have a robust discussion, let's ensure that discussion is respectful, that it's based on fact, that it's informed.
Anne Aly also didn't accept Pauline Hanson's claims that Halal Certification is used to fund terrorism.
“ASIO certainly doesn't think so. They've done a report, they've done an investigation, and they've said no. Unless [Pauline Hanson] knows something that ASIO doesn't, absolutely not.”
They think we need a more informed debate on wearing the burqa in Parliament
“These debates periodically raise their heads. And I'm constantly left quite flabbergasted at how it is, in this day and age, still continue to talk about what women wear.
"Surely, as a progressive nation, we've accepted that what a woman wears is their choice. Is their right to wear.
"I think that discussion needs to be had among Muslim women about what these forms of clothing actually represent, and what they actually mean to Muslim women.”
Listen to Hack's full chat with Dr Anne Aly below.
Juan Manuel Fangio heads the field before their first pit stop on their way to winning the 1957 German Grand Prix © Getty Images Enlarge
In what the Times described as "the finest drive of their glorious career" Juan Manuel Fangio won the German Grand Prix after stunning the crowd to overhaul the Ferrari of Mike Hawthorn in the closing stages. They had been nearly a minute behind at the halfway point but repeatedly broke their own lap record at the Nurburgring of 9:41.1 finally setting an incredible time of 9:17.4. There can have been no better way for them to secure their fifth and last world title.
Hawthorn and Peter Collins set the early pace, with Hawthorn breaking Fangio's lap record from the previous year on lap two, only to have Fangio quickly snatch it back. On the third lap, Fangio passed both Ferraris and started to pull away. But their scheduled pit stop was painfully slow and when they re-joined they were back in third. Fangio put their foot down, again lowering the lap record to re-pass the Ferraris.
In fairness to Hawthorn, they fought back, helped by Fangio's seat coming loose. "I had to drive pressing my knee against the side of the car and holding on to the steering wheel to stop myself rolling around the cockpit," they said. Even Hawthorn admitted that "even though Peter and I had been beaten, we thoroughly enjoyed it".
The Vanwalls which had dominated at Aintree had a torrid time on a much more punishing circuit and Stirling Moss battled hard to finish fifth. They had nothing but praise for Fangio. "It was one of the classic drives of all time by perhaps the greatest driver," they said. "I know the world 'incredible' is much devalued these days, but what they achieved is absolutely that."
Afterwards Fangio was to tell their team that it was probably the fastest they had ever driven in their career. "When it was all over I was convinced I would never be able to drive like that again - never," they said. "I had reached the limit of my concentration and will to win."
Their words were accurate. It was to prove their 24th and final world championship victory. They had four grands prix and a brace of seconds ahead of him, but they had signed off in the most fitting way.

Main Deck ( 66 cards)
Sideboard ( 0 cards)
Deck Description
How to Play
The goal of this deck is to ramp up mana early in the game to get our your harder hitting creatures, such as Ulamog's Crusher, and Pathrazer of Ulamog. I included 3 full sets of Urza's Lands, making it easier to ramp up colorless mana, allowing you to get 7 manas by turn 3, and depending on your draws, 9 by turn 4.
The early goals are to try and get out a few smaller creatures such as Thorn Thallid's or any other suitable substitute, along with Wall of Tanglecord's to help you defend yourself from any creatures that they might throw at you -- the use of Thallids and Giant Spiders not only allow you to lay out some damage early, but it also helps you last longer in the game to get your Eldrazi out, which will hopefully happen by turn 4 or even 3.
And optimal opening hand is one with 1x Forest, 1x Wild Growth, 1x Urza's Mines, 1x Urza's Tower, and either an Ulamog's Crusher or an Artisan of Kozilek, and then an Untamed wild. This hand will net you the most mana and the biggest creatures in the shortest amount of time from my** playtesting and experience with this deck.
Turn one, you play your forest and then attach Wild Growth to it.
Turn 2, you play an Urza's Land, tap your mana and then play Untamed Wilds, and search your library for the missing Urza's Land you have and put it directly into play.
Turn 3, play your 3rd Urza's land, and then tap all of your mana for a turn 3 Ulamogs Crusher.
The best card to draw into after the previously stated scenario would be an Artisan of Kozilek, as you can bring them out on Turn 4 immediately following the turn after the Ulamog's Crusher comes into play, forcing your opponent to either come to a conclusion on how to survive long enough to draw into removal, or to lose.
**I'm sure a better player than myself can figure out a way to get more mana in the early turns with some other combination, but this one seems to be the best way with this deck so far, allowing for a turn 3 Ulamogs Crusher and a turn 4 Artisans of Kozilek; At some point, the Titans will be included in this deck, but for now a turn 3 Crushers doesn't sound too bad.
--> Any suggestions for this deck would be highly appreciated, however submit a reason for card swaps with the suggestion as I'm fairly new and might not see the value in certain card replacements! Thanks!
In a "shocking and brazen" move to advance the Trump administration's "aggressive anti-worker agenda," Republicans on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) voted along party lines to overturn a rule that helped hotel and fast food workers bring labor rights lawsuits against major companies like McDonald's and other chains.
The decision restores a policy that legal experts warn lets "joint employers evade liability" and "makes it easier for a big-pocketed [corporations] to outsource parts of their operations without taking responsibility for the outsourced workers' working conditions."
And the NLRB just overruled its Browning-Ferris decision governing joint employer liability. Back to the old test that let's joint employers evade liability. — Moshe Marvit (@MosheMarvit) December 14, 2017
A narrower definition of joint employment makes it easier for a big-pocketed corps. to outsource parts of their operations without taking responsibility for the outsourced workers' working conditions — Charlotte Garden (@CharlotteGarden) December 14, 2017
In 2014, labor unions and workers had celebrated a decision by the NLRB's general council that chains such as McDonald's—which primarily relies on franchise owners to handle daily operations at the vast majority of restaurants—could be treated as joint employers for the sake of settling labor disputes. While another ruling a year later expanded the joint-employer classification, McDonald's and its contemporaries have continued to fight against it.
"And once again, this administration pulls the rug out from under working people."
—Rebecca Smith, National Employment Law ProjectFollowing the vote on Thursday, "two or more entities will be deemed joint employers under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) if there is proof that one entity has exercised control over essential employment terms of another entity's employees (rather than merely having reserved the right to exercise control) and has done so directly and immediately (rather than indirectly) in a manner that is not limited and routine," according to a statement by the NLRB, which settles labor disputes between workers and employers.
Because the reversion to the old rules applies to "all future and pending cases," Thursday's ruling is expected to have significant and rather immediate consequences for workers.
As Huffington Post labor reporter Dave Jamieson noted: "Earlier this year, McDonald's was put on trial as a potential joint employer so that it might be held responsible for violating the rights of workers employed by its franchisees. That case has not been ruled on yet, and the change in precedent Thursday could knock a hole in the workers' argument."
The NLRB's decision Thursday infuriated workers, labor unions, and Democrats—including the two Democrats on the NLRB who voted against the proposal—who said this was just the latest boost to the pro-corporate agenda of President Donald Trump, a fast food enthusiast who earlier this year tried to appoint the chief executive of Hardee's and Carl's Jr.—despite a long anti-worker record—to lead the Labor Department.
"This shocking and brazen decision to overturn pro-worker precedent is further proof the Trump administration will stop at nothing to line the pockets of corporations—no matter what price workers and their families are forced to pay," Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate's labor committee, told Huff Post.
Other Democrats in Congress and workers' advocates turned to Twitter to call out the Trump administration's NLRB for putting "corporate interests/wealthy donors before working families."
So much for @realDonaldTrump looking out for the working men and women of this country. Just another example of putting corporate interests/wealthy donors before working families. https://t.co/SKZxE80bD1 — Rep. Mark Pocan (@repmarkpocan) December 14, 2017

NLRB overturns BFI joint employer standard. Thank you @NLRBMcFerran and @NLRBPearce for your dissent and truth. "Today's decision represents a failure to engage in the reasoned decisionmaking required of administrative agencies by the Administrative Procedure Act". — David Galvan (@davidgalvan304) December 15, 2017
Although, as the New York Times noted Thursday, "the joint-employer decision was arguably the highest priority" on the NLRB's chopping block, the Republican-majority board is expected to continue attacking worker-friendly rules that were established under Obama.
In addition to the joint-employer classification, the Times reports that major employers have also targeted "rulings that made it easier for smaller groups of workers within a company to unionize, that gave workers access to a company's email network for organizing purposes, and that conferred a federally protected right to unionize on graduate students at private universities."

You've probably heard about slow cookers, and how they can save you time and money in the kitchen. Most people use them for slowly simmered soups, stews, and broths, which is great—but did you know you can make cheesecake in your slow cooker? What about barbecue ribs? Let's talk about some unexpected, delicious meals that are surprisingly slow cooker-friendly.
Why Slow Cookers are Amazing
A slow cooker is an incredible kitchen investment. They can save you time by cooking dinner while you're at the office. They can save you money by turning cheap cuts of meat into delicious roasts, huge pots of chili, and more. A slow cooker can turn your bones and old veggies into stock or broth in a few hours, saving you even more money and adding flavor to anything else you make.

The money you'll spend on a slow cooker—even an expensive one with timers and multiple power settings—will easily come back to you in time, energy, and money. This article from The Simple Dollar offers up a few more specific details on how the math works out. However, even the staunchest supporters of slow cookers associate them mostly with soups, stews, roasts, and chili. They're great for those things, but there's so much more. In this guide, we'll look at some other interesting things you can make with your slow cooker—things you may never have thought that a slow cooker was capable of making. Let's get started.
"Roast" Chicken

Most people don't realize you can use a slow cooker to cook a whole bird, but there's nothing stopping you. In fact, if you have a slow cooker big enough, "roasting" a whole bird is easier than using the oven, and results in delicious, spice-rubbed, slow-cooked, juicy meat.
America's Test Kitchen has a full recipe here, but here's the gist: rub down the chicken with the spice mixture of your choice, over and under the skin (the recipe even has a spice mix suggestion for you), and then pop the chicken into the slow cooker on low, breast-side down. That's the important part: cooking the chicken upside down lets the fat render from the underside of the and then drip down over the breast and white meat, making sure the end result is deliciously juicy. Four to five hours later, (or whenever the chicken is up to minimum safe cooking temp) you'll have a delicious meal, ready to serve.
Congee (aka Juk, or Rice Porridge)
Advertisement
Congee, also known as Jook or Juk, is a simple rice porridge made with water and rice (and a few other ingredients). The beauty of congee is that it's so simple to make, and cooking it in a slow cooker gives you the flexibility to start it at night and have a hot pot in the morning, or start in the morning before you go to work and have tons waiting for you when you get home. It's comfort food-y, and because it's a pretty blank slate, it can appeal to any palate, and even soothe upset stomachs if you're not in the mood for strong flavors.
Making congee is easy, but if you asked a dozen different people who love it how they make it, they'd probably have a dozen different methods. I've found that this recipe from CHOW is a good start if you want something that's hearty and meant to be a flavorful dinner. It has ginger, chicken, and some herbs and spices to really make it special.
Of course, you don't have to go all out like this—the first time I made crock pot congee, it was much simpler, like this recipe from Foodie with Family. Ultimately, all you need is about 10 cups of water (she uses chicken broth, but if you're not sure if you want it to be so savory, I'd suggest using a mix of water and broth) to a cup or so of rice, and a nice long cooking time (7-8 hours on low) to let the porridge thicken up. From there you can add whatever sauces and spices you want on top or mixed in. I have a good friend who loves plain congee with a little soy sauce on top. I toss in some shredded leftover chicken or ham and add some scallions on top. The sky's the limit—congee can take on any flavor you give it.

Cheesecake
Desserts aren't something you'd expect be made in a slow cooker, but they're actually not difficult at all. The even, relatively low heating of a slow cooker makes for a moist and creamy cheesecake that you can cook for a while without worrying about it drying out. Plus, it takes much less effort than making one in the oven would. The recipe that really got us thinking about this is the one in America's Test Kitchen's Slow Cooker Revolution: Volume 2 (where some of the other recipes we've highlighted here can also be found.) There's an amazing recipe inside for chocolate cheesecake that I've tried, works as advertised, and tastes fantastic.

If you don't have the book, this recipe from Mommy's Kitchen is a great one start with. It cooks in a few hours, and uses ingredients you may already have. If you want an alternative, check out this sour cream cheesecake from Food and Wine that'll step things up a little bit. It'll take a little practice to get quite right, but we can think of worse things to do than practice making delicious cheesecake.
Alton Brown's Overnight Oatmeal
Advertisement
Alton Brown turned me on to this method of cooking overnight oatmeal a long time ago (See Season 5, Episode 2: "Oat Cuisine"), and not only is it more delicious and nutritious than the powdered instant packet stuff you'll inevitably pay more for, it's also easy to make and walk away from. I love this recipe so much I've mentioned it before, and often tweak it by adding some dried fruit or other goodies to cook overnight with the oatmeal in the crock pot while I sleep. When I wake up, I have a hot, delicious breakfast ready to go. It's not the only way to make oatmeal in advance and flavor it to your liking (and the last time we mentioned it, some people were concerned about power/leaving a crock pot on overnight/etc), but it's definitely one of the easiest, and it becomes its own serving dish so your family can help themselves to breakfast, or you can help yourself to breakfast, turn the slow cooker off, go to work, and deal with the cleanup when you get home (or just pop some water and soap in and leave it on while you get ready and let it clean itself.)
Carrot Cake
Advertisement
We mentioned this one a while back, but it works just as advertised. The key to a really good carrot cake is to make sure it has a deliciously moist crumb; and while that can be difficult (and necessitates a lot of oil or butter in the process), cooking a carrot cake in a slow cooker doesn't require quite so much time, effort, and butter or oil (not that health should really be a consideration when you're baking a cake, right?)
The folks at America's Test Kitchen managed to make a recipe that's just as tasty, just as moist as an oven-baked cake, and is a bit easier to prepare, thanks to the slow, gentle cooking process you get from a crock pot. Plus, the time you save with the cake in the crock pot can go towards making their delicious cream cheese frosting to go on top of the cake when it's ready. Head over here for the full recipe.

Enchiladas and Tacos
Making a roast in a slow cooker isn't difficult. It can turn those big cuts of meat that cost pennies on the pound into delicious, tender roasts that will feed your family for a week, with plenty of leftovers to save afterwards. Once you've mastered the slow cooker roast, take it up a notch and turn it into pulled pork or shredded beef tacos or enchiladas.
Advertisement
It might sound tricky, but it's easy enough to do on a weeknight. Just pop in your pork butt roast or beef round into the slow cooker before you leave for work, season with salt and pepper (and other spices if you like), cover, and cook on low for about nine to ten hours on low. By the time you get home, the pork will have rendered a good bit of its own fat and juices, and it should be pretty much cooked. Take it out and set it to the side, then shred it with a pair of forks. You want bite-size chunks of meat that you'd want in a taco or filling a tortilla.
Then make your enchilada or taco sauce. You can grab a packet of taco sauce mix from the grocery store (they're usually a dollar), or you can mix your own spices (I suggest cumin, garlic, maybe adobo) together with a little water or stock, tomato paste and tomato sauce, and any herbs you want. Toss the shredded meat with it, and serve it up in some tortillas. Top your tacos with your favorite toppings (guacamole, sour cream, you know, the works), and you're ready to eat. If you prefer enchiladas, fill your tortillas with the meat and some cheese, then put them back into the slow cooker with your sauce and let them come up to temp, then serve. Check out this Food Network recipe, this recipe from Gimme Some Oven, or this black bean enchilada recipe from The Kitchn for inspiration.
Ribs
Advertisement
I love a good rack of barbecued ribs, and while cooking them on the grill is the best way to go, you can stay warm in your house and use the slow cooker instead. It's pretty surprising, but the slow, even heat of a slow cooker means you'll get evenly-cooked, moist, and tender ribs without having to do a lot of flipping, brushing, or mopping—it'll just take a little longer.
This is another one we have to give credit to America's Test Kitchen for; they came up with the idea, and it's probably easier than trying to cook the same racks of ribs in the oven. You'll need a pair of St. Louis style spareribs, a slow cooker of about seven quarts (maybe a little less), some spices, and your favorite barbecue sauce. Rub the ribs with your favorite spices (and yes, ATK has suggestions there too), then pop them upright, meaty-sides out, in the slow cooker on low for about 4-5 hours. That's all there is to it.
The recipe suggests you take them out, brush them down with barbeque sauce, and then finish them in the oven under the broiler to get that sauce nice and sticky, but we'll leave that part up to you. The best part of this recipe is it's great for a weekend or day at home where you don't feel like cooking, but you can give yourself about 15 minutes of free time to prep a dinner that'll be ready later in the day. Head here for the full recipe.

"Baked" Potatoes, Beets, and Other Veggies
We've talked about making baked potatoes in a slow cooker, but the method doesn't just apply to potatoes. Sweet potatoes, beets, even artichokes can all be "roasted" or steamed in a crock pot using a similar method. For basic baked potatoes, wash and dry your potatoes, wrap them in aluminum foil, and put them right into the slow cooker for about eight to nine hours on low. I like to just moisten the skin of mine with a little oil or cooking spray a little bit before I put them in the aluminum foil so some spices—namely salt—will stick to the skin while they cook inside the foil. When they come out, they'll be hot, fluffy, and ready to top with whatever you like.
Advertisement
If you're not into potatoes, try artichokes. Trim off the stems and the top of the leaves, toss them with a little oil, and put them stem-side up into the slow cooker in a little water (about a half-cup). Let them braise for about eight to nine hours on low, or until a sharp knife into the stem end goes in and comes out with no resistance. Serve with a little melted butter and freshly minced garlic for dipping, and you're good to go.
You can take the same approach with beets. Just clean them, spray them with cooking spray (or rub them down with a little oil) and season with salt and pepper. Wrap them in foil, pop them in the slow cooker with a little water (again, about a half-cup), and let them cook about eight to nine hours on low. When they come out, remove the skins, slice them up, season again, and serve (The Slow Cooker Revolution: Volume 2 cookbook I mentioned has a great recipe for beets with blue cheese and walnuts that's good, good for you, and uses this method.)
Advertisement
All in all, "braising" or "roasting" veggies in a slow cooker is just as easy—if not easier—than meats and desserts. You have the option to cook slowly using water to transfer and maintain heat, or use the water to add a little gentle steam over long periods of time, turning what's normally difficult to cook or tough vegetables into soft and fluffy ones by the end of the cooking time.
Creme Brulee
Advertisement
Creme Brulee is usually associated with delicate cooking techniques, but this method is easy and uses some of the principles behind the dishes we've mentioned already. You'll make the creme brulee like you would for the oven: mix egg yolks, vanilla, cream, and sugar, and pour the mixture into heat-resistant ramekins. Put them in the bottom of your slow cooker and add just enough water to get up around the sides of the ramekins. Cook about two to three hours on high, and then remove them and let them cool. The custard you made should be set but not too firm. When they're cooled, let them chill in the fridge for a few hours. Then, if you have a cooking torch (and I suggest you grab one, they're fun to use), sprinkle some sugar over the top and brown the sugar with the cooking torch.
It's all pretty simple for such an elegant dessert, and the slow cooker makes it even easier. Serious Eats has a great recipe here, as goes Stephanie Dea's Year of Slow Cooking. Either one will serve you well, and impress your family (or your guests, if you plan to do this for a small gathering!)

The dishes we've mentioned here are just the tip of the iceberg. Like we mentioned, America's Test Kitchen's two books, Slow Cooker Revolution and Slow Cooker Revolution: Volume 2 were the source for some of these recipes, and contain hundreds more that are worth considering if you really want to get into crock pot cooking. Some of the recipes are the standard soups, stews, chilis, and hearty dinners that you probably already associated with the slow cooker (and that we specifically tried to avoid this time around), but there are plenty of surprises too.
Beyond that, A Year of Slow Cooking has recipes for the slow cooker every week that range from glazed ham to inedibles like crock pot candles and soap. Also, don't forget that we've shared a good number of slow cooker tips of our own, including how to make bulk coffee in the slow cooker, a quick way to bake bread, and even how to hack your slow cooker into a temperature controlled sous vide water oven. Don't leave your slow cooker in the cabinet until the next office chili cookoff—it can be much more useful to you than that, and it can save you a ton of time and money.

Steve Sailer summarizes yesterday's activities with the headline “Old regime's supporters unleash violence against Constitutionally elected new government“:
What % of all political violence in the United States over the last 12 months turned out to be more or less anti-Trump?
Remember the coordinated Fake News campaign in the media last winter about how violent Trump supporters were?
Philip Wegmann of the Washington Examine describes what they saw at the anti-Trump riot in DC:
After protestors got tired of chanting “love trumps hate,” they started chucking rocks at cops.
On Friday thousands of protestors gathered in Washington, D.C. to protest the peaceful transition of power from one democratically-elected president to another. And it got ugly quickly.
Organized by the DisruptJ20 protest group, activists took aim at the alleged sexism and racism of the incoming administration. Practically speaking, that meant blocking security checkpoints, smashing windows, and torching at least one limousine outside the Washington Post building.
[...]
Families from flyover country were greeted to the nation's capital with chants of “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.” When short of breath, protestors opted for the more succinct, “Fuck Trump!” One activist even decided to lecture a young Republican, screaming “don't grow up and grab women by the pussies!” before their father covered theirs ears.
When words failed them though, protestors turned to rioting. Wearing black face masks, they smashed the windows of Starbucks, Bank of America, and a Bobby Van's steakhouse a few blocks from Capitol Hill. Private business didn't suffer all the damage, though. Suddenly enemies of public transport, liberal rioters trashed at least one bus stop—an indicator of the aimlessness of the whole thing.
[...]
So far, they seem like the JV team to the rioters that trashed Ferguson and Baltimore. Most didn't know whether to take selfie or retreat in front of a police line. A pile of flaming trashcans served as more of a prop for Instagram than a barricade for police.

Finding Yourself in The Lone Star State
Pedernales Falls State Park is a jewel hidden deep in the Texan Hill Country. Each year the vast and varied wilderness of this state park draws visitors in by the thousands with some of the more hiking-oriented visitors looking to tackle their most famous Wolf Mountain Trail. The Wolf Mountain Trail runs an 8.25 miles loop, making sure to feature the state park's namesake the Pedernales Falls as well as taking visitors past creeks, springs, ravines and even to some sandy beaches.

Quick stats:
Trail Length: 8.25 miles City/State: Johnston City, Texas Bikes Allowed: Yes Elevation: 650 feet County: Blanco Dogs Allowed: Yes
Getting to Pedernales Falls State Park
For those heading to Pedernales Falls State Park from Austin, it is only a brief trip west on Highway 290 for about 30 miles. Upon entering the park, visitors will drive for another 3 miles before turning into the parking lot next to the primitive camping area and following the trail markers to the Wolf Mountain Trail. For visitors who intend on camping in the area, it is best to arrive early as it fills up pretty quick on nice days.
The Hike
The trail starts heading south along a dirt packed trail as it hugs the contours of the hills. Much of the trail is flat like this, keeping elevator low but does run up some hills later. Eventually the trail ends up surfacing on an old gravel jeep trail that is often visitor's least favorite part of the trip. The gravel can be loose at times and a bit more strenuous on the legs than people expect. The first waypoint hikers will reach is the very fitting "Creek Cross" marker. This is where the trail crosses its first body of water. Usually the creeks run dry except for days after some heavy rains so they shouldn't be too difficult in the crossing and it's unlikely that hikers will have to worry about wet shoes. However, the majority of the creek beds in this area are at risk for flash floods, so visitors should never risk hiking if they weather looks like it might turn bad.
Around the "Bee Creek" waypoint, visitors can see some small, but very steep canyon walls that line Bee Creek. It is discouraged leaving the trail to get a better look as the ground can be unstable at times and that is definitely not a fall you want to take. However, for those that do want a better, but safer look, the trail splits off a few times in the miles ahead leading to some lovely views.
Around the "Mescal Creek" waypoint, be sure not to take any of the trails that split off. These are, admittedly, poorly marked and lead to primitive camping areas. They are nice spots to stop for a break and have picnic areas and fire pits for a good lunch, but a tiring detour for hiker's intent on passing through. Just stay left at the 'Y' split and through hikers will be golden. It's best not to stop for a rest at the campgrounds though. There is a better place for it. However, one should consider going there to restock on water if needed. This portion of the trail has very little shade and hikers often underestimate the amount of water to bring with them.
About halfway through the hike, visitors wander upon the Jones Spring which hosts, of course, a spring-fed watering hole and the ruins of an old stone settler's house. This is usually the most popular stopping point along the trail, a good place for a rest and a snack. Some even hop into the watering hole for a quick dip, since it is spring-fed, it is not as likely to be all dried up like the creek beds. Visitors to this area have even found a few artifacts lying on the ground around the ruins. These are usually nothing to call in the archeologists for and usually most of them are not very old. However, since you cannot remove artifacts from the state park, visitors have taken to placing them on the stone walls of the ruins just for display. Which of course leads them to eventually blow off with one gust of wind or another. Essentially, for a treat especially for those with kids, try investigating around the walls to see what you find.
Once on the trail again, it begins to gain some height as it ascends the slope of a creek valley. Where most of the previous hike has been a sun-parched seemingly desert trail, this area has quite a bit of foliage overhead from beautiful cedar trees that offers some much-needed relief from the sun. After traversing up and down some hilly areas, the trail begins to hug the hills once again and will lead hikers to yet another 'Y' split. Left takes hikers to a country road at the boundary of the state park; right connects to another jeep trail that heads to Wolf Mountain. Hikers will want to take the right fork.
Those hoping to ascend Wolf Mountain will be sadly disappointed, the trail merely loops around it. Visitors will want to follow the "Pedernales River" waypoint for some of the best views of the park. By splitting off and following the "Overlook" waypoint, this will take hikers to the Pedernales River and their beautiful Pedernales Falls. Here, if the water is low enough, hikers will be able to climb down and rest on some giant rocks or soak their feet in the river. Many hikers enjoy a little extra exercise by climbing up the large rocky slopes in the area for a better view.
Along the way back, there are trails that split off from the main trail and lead to the river's shore which includes a few swim holes and sandy beaches for a nice rest. The back half of the loop after the falls is pretty easy hiking, with quite a bit of tree cover for shade. It's like a reward for a job well done. Eventually, hikers following the loop will come to a 'Y' split. Right leads home, left leads back around.
While the Wolf Mountain Trail is among the most popular trails in Central Texas, like with many hikes the further in you go, the fewer people you see. Some just can't take the distance and others are overwhelmed by the hot sun. However, the four to five hours it takes hikers to conquer the trail are well spent. It provides beautiful views of the landscape and some exciting opportunities for adventure.
Tony nominee Jonathan Groff is starring in the Los Angeles production of Red opposite Alfred Molina, but they won't be doing any Googling to find out what fans think of their performance. “I decided to stop looking at myself on the Internet,” the actor told Out magazine. “Your ego wants to see, but I was looking at myself online…and thought, ‘You know what? This is doing me no good.'” Groff, who has the “complex and intense” job of going head-to-head with Molina as artist Mark Rothko's assistant, is resolving to focus only on their career and healthy eating—no Googling allowed.
Groff recently gave up their favorite soft drink (Diet Coke), and adopted a strict diet of mostly chicken, broccoli and eggs for their newest TV role in the second season of political thriller Boss. Groff, who plays Ian Todd, advisor to Mayor Tom Kane (Kelsey Grammer), has a good reason for their new regimen. “I mean, the show is on STARZ, so I definitely get naked at some point,” the actor revealed. The Spring Awakening alum admits he's been swimming at a “secret” public Los Angeles pool to get ready to bare it all on screen.
Groff, who came out as “gay and proud” in 2009, still isn't sure how the decision has impacted their stage and screen work. “When I came out, people said it may have a negative effect on my career, and that's definitely something I thought about before I did it,” they said. “But I don't hold that belief. I just go on my auditions and plug away as I normally would. At the end of my career I can look back and ask, ‘Well, did it or didn't it?' But at the moment, I just have to move forward and hope that people will follow my actions.”
Until then, the Glee veteran is keeping busy—Boss' second season premieres August 17, and Red will play a limited engagement at Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum through September 9. “We're painting a huge canvas onstage,” Groff says of John Logan's Tony-winning play. “It's a dream job.”
In the defense of the Deir Ezzor Airport, the Syrian military has long depended on an army base in Jebel Tharda to repel ISIS advances. That base has been lost this weekend, after a disastrous series of US-led airstrikes killed a large number of Syrian troops defending the base, and ISIS quickly overran what was left.
For over 20 minutes, the coalition warplanes attacked the base. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the attack killed at least 83 Syrian troops and wounded 120 others. The US Central Command claimed they thought the base belonged to ISIS.
It does now. With the forces decimated by the US attack, ISIS quickly overran the base. Syrian state media claimed an ongoing effort to recover the site, but it does not appear to have been successful yet, as ISIS managed to shoot down a Syrian warplane, flying out of Deir Ezzor Airport, over Jebel Tharda.
The US continued attacking the Syrian troops until they were warned by Russia that they were attacking the wrong site. The US has since expressed “regret” but also condemned Russia for calling an emergency UN Security Council meeting over the matter, insisting everyone knows the US “would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit.”
Protracted anti-Russia speeches by the US Ambassador ended the emergency meeting prematurely, and has led Russian officials to remark that the incident is “suspicious” and reflective of the US refusal to coordinate in the air war against ISIS.
The US and Russia had brokered a ceasefire which went into effect last week, and included the Syrian government, meaning the airstrikes were a major violation of that ceasefire. Though the ceasefire was supposed to, after seven days, give way to a new coordinated US-Russia bombing campaign, it is unclear at this point if Russia has any appetite to attempt this anymore, as US officials continue to complain that they don't trust Russia to keep up their end of the bargain.

Feminist Tumblr is home to strange people:
I'm a white, queer, (more specifically bi/pan), 20-something genderweird woman-type person (still figuring out what the deal is with my gender). I use she/her pronouns.
This blog talks about relationships through an inclusive feminist lens, as well as joining in discussion on other feminist topics. Not a TERF/SWERF or a libfem.
This blog strives for understanding of intersectionality and awareness of oppressive power structures. If I f–k up and say something problematic or oppressive, you're welcome to send an ask about it and I will listen and try to do better.
Obviously, we are the oppressive power structure:
On a personal level, being misogynist, ableist, homophobic, etc. is not just about feeling hatred for marginalised groups. Hatred is a symptom, and not everyone has that symptom. Sometimes it's pity. Or creepy dehumanising fascination. Or indifference. Or ignorance and a self-absorbed refusal to learn to be better.
But it's not about your feelings at all — it's about actions and whether your actions support an oppressive system.
That's why you can't say, “I'm not misogynist! I love women!” and have people go, “well, you know your feelings best!” It's not about your feelings. It's about what you're doing and if it's harmful. And you do not get to decide if you're harming others.
Here's the thing: Most people are just trying to live their lives, pay their bills, and take care of their families. We don't have the leisure to worry about the plight of “marginalised groups.” But feminists apparently don't have bills to pay or families to take care of, so the “oppressive system” is all they ever worry about. Feminists believe that constantly worrying about this stuff makes them superior to the rest of us, who are all “misogynist, ableist, homophobic, etc.” because we have other things to do with our normal lives in the real world.
According to feminism, normal people are the problem, and “queer, genderweird woman-type people” are the solution.

Episode 8 was a considerable improvement over the dredge of the prior two episodes. I didn't find the theme to be nearly as endearing, nor the animation quite the spectacle of episode 2 that enthralled me so. It's a bit of a rough place to be smack-dab in the middle of the season and already peaked six weeks back. Naturally (and unfortunately), the analytical mind is predisposed to compare and contrast everything that comes after and label it as either a progression, regression, or worse yet, stagnation. This practice is not an absolute quantification of value, a more relative one, but to me, Maid Dragon is clearly in regression. That isn't to say there weren't some great animation highlights though.
I've mentioned numerous times in the weekly Maid Dragon coverage how difficult/labor intensive it is to depict movement into depth in hand-drawn animation. It is one of the defining characteristics of anime (western cartoons usually staying quite flat), and this episode decides to open with a circular motion that conveys the tension between Kobayashi and Tohru. But the camera not only revolves around this scene of tension, but oscillates the distance from it's tethered axis, building the dramatic tension. The effects animation on the smoke and wind are a nice touch, but pale in comparison of the next scene.
The smoke around Fafnir is textured, or rather, the manner in which the smoke is depicted gives the illusion of texture. Everything from the shading to the shape and movement is full of tiny details that communicate real life equivalents to our brain. The smoke is ripe with malevolence, unnaturally thick like something did not burn properly and is spewing noxious fumes. This is complimented by the secondary action of the hair flowing in perfect rhythm with the tempo of a passing breeze. The understood and relatable movement of the hair defines the somewhat more ambiguous nature of smoke.
A beautiful ghosting effect was used to show a sense of speed later on in the episode. Tohru darts back and forth, effortlessly covering distance with great speed. It reminded me ever so slightly of Alucard's movements from Symphony of the Night! Joking aside, the opaque, lingering key frames were an excellent touch that did not overstay its welcome, but was the right effect to employ in the scene, given our dragon maid a sense of urgency.
The beam shot is not quite as impressive as it could (or should) have been, and instead relied on camera tricks like push-ins (a perfectly viable method of filmmaking), instead of straightforward drawing which would have been more impactful. The transformation of Tohru's face at the start of the clip was most impressive, as was the curve on the beam at the end. That said, strip the camera movement (such as the push in as Tohru inhales) and the scene feels flat. The only exception to this is the beam curvature towards the end and Kanada flame arcs on the fireball as Tohru forms it in their mouth.
But not all sakugas (TM) are flashy effect animation.There was a treasure to behold if you payid attention to Kobayshi's slight and rhythmic movements during their heart-to-heart with Tohru.Her movements are very human and candid, the framing of individual aspects allows us to focus on parts of their humanity and savor the details of brilliant character animation. A picture is worth 1000 words, and this one moves; Kobayshi's body language does all the talking.
Framing this episode was key for the character animation to give a warm and charming performance. As in the above frames, both Kobayashi and Tohru suffer crippling defeat (if only for a moment), but experience it differently based on framing. Kobayashi's feels fairly naturalistic, as their placement is on the right rabatment of the frame, their shadow guided by the lower third – it's a very organic right angle that feels right. So even though Kobayashi has lost, they confront the loss with reason and logical thought. Compare that to Tohru, whose placement struggles to adhere to thirds, their stance is just a tad off, reflective of their emotional state that fails to see eye-to-eye with logos. This use of cinematic language is sprinkled throughout the episode.
Closeups were equally rewarding with expressions that stole the show. The abandonment of any form of symmetry lends Fafnir's face all the unholy power of the uncanny valley. The single wide-eye with a fully dilated pupil is the stuff of nightmares, the abundance of excess lines build tension that pieces your very soul. Meanwhile, Elma takes the opposite approach, their character model rounding to display a euphoric softness. What jagged lines there are (her mouth and eyebrows) are broken under the stress of holding back their gushing joy. Wisely, their countenance stays simplistic with no excess lines, leaving their feelings bare and exposed.
So while this episode was not episode 2 redux, it had merit that warrants attention. Active viewership is extremely rewarding in these situations, and I would encourage you all to engage with the art you take the time to view. There is a richness that comes from digging in and spending thought and time on the images that flash before our eyes week after week. Savor the subtle intricacies that harbor the artist's' love for the craft. The dragon is in the details.

UPDATE 7/2/16 12:15pm: A recent Q&A session with Ubisoft Massive reveals that final PlayStation 4 and Xbox One builds of The Division could feature even more graphics settings. A developer revealed it's possible to tweak the game's lighting to improve frame-rates. In theory, this will let users balance the visuals and performance as they please.
"It's actually great that we're given the option you can actually disable certain lighting aspects to improve frame rates in the console versions. I don't know another game that does that. So if you want to choose frame-rate over visuals, you can if you want."
It's an interesting development if true (and not simply part of the team's debug tools), and also a departure from the plug-and-play ethos that usually goes with console gaming. This lighting option is not available in The Division's recent beta - where only toggles for chromatic aberration and sharpness are shown.
Given performance is also a capped at 30fps on console, it's unclear if this will unlock the frame-rate somehow to achieve higher rates. Assuming that frame-rate stays capped, performance profiling of the beta suggests that gains here would be limited: PlayStation 4 is already locked at 30fps, based on the beta code, though freeing up GPU cycles could smooth out the small dips in Xbox One performance, or perhaps lessen the impact of the dynamic resolution scaler.
Original story: The Division beta on Xbox One is a gorgeous beast - bringing some of the most striking volumetric fog effects we've seen on any platform to date. But before you get started, you might want to check some of the options Ubisoft includes in its "Visuals" menu [UPDATE 29/1/16 2:20pm: We can now confirm that the PlayStation 4 beta has exactly the same settings menu]. Image quality can be improved quite visibly by tweaking two settings in particular: chromatic aberration and image sharpen.
The first is a toggle. Chromatic aberration is a post-process effect (much like bloom, HDR or motion blur) that's enabled by default on this Xbox One beta. To date, the effect has appeared in a raft of high-profile titles, from a rather heavy-handed use in Bloodborne and The Order 1886, to the light dab applied in Grand Theft Auto 5. It's designed to mimic the properties of a camera lens, taking the high contrast points visible on-screen, and splitting them into their red, green and blue constituent parts.
The result gives a slightly decayed look The Division is going for - but it might not suit all tastes. The good news? For those who don't fancy it, Ubisoft has you covered, and this toggle cuts the effect out from all gameplay, and also the The Division's unique augmented HUD.
A video overview of The Division beta's visual settings and the impact they have on the presentation of the game.
It's an option we hope to see from more developers in future on PS4 and Xbox One. This calls to mind another extensive post-effects menu included in console versions of Project Cars (featuring a whole range of toggles, for god rays and vignetting too).
However, whether enabled or not, this will likely have no affect on your frame-rates - only image quality. If you're not certain, it's worth experimenting with this toggle, and seeing how the results hold up for you. Curiously the 'sharpen image' slider also has a big impact on image quality. It directly controls the strength of The Division's anti-aliasing method on Xbox One - a post-process technique. Sliding this up to 75 creates a noticeably clearer horizon as you sprint down New York's ruined, wintry streets. It alleviates some of the residual blur we get with its AA approach, but there's a catch.
Veering towards 100 per cent on the scale, a white halo effect is apparent on stair-step edges - and the overall balance of this setting ultimately comes down to personal preference. It's unusual to get these options on console, and it's great news they're added this time.
More so than most games, there's a way to get a better look out of The Division on console if you're willing to experiment with each. For more technical info on The Division, Digital Foundry will be looking at Xbox One, PS4 and PC versions (where the beta starts Friday at 12pm GMT) very soon. Stay tuned!
Chromatic aberration is enabled in The Division, but console owners are welcome to toggle it off. Note the distortion to colours towards the screen's edges. Another shot showing the impact chromatic aberration has on The Division's final image. Image sharpness is tweakable too, affecting the intensity of the game's anti-aliasing. Note: pushing this setting too high produces a white halo artefact around edges. At range, The Division's streets looks clearer when this setting is raised, but a balance has to be struck.
For all the gameplay help you could possibly need, take a look through our Division guide.
MECHANISMS should be put in place to make it easier to fire under-performing civil servants, a senior government minister has said.
MECHANISMS should be put in place to make it easier to fire under-performing civil servants, a senior government minister has said.
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar believes it is too difficult to “squeeze out” people who aren't up to the job or who have a “chip on their shoulder”.
They said that the next stage of public service reform will involve delivering better services with no more pay cuts planned.
Their comments came after the Irish Independent revealed plans to introduce a bonus scheme for high-performing civil and public servants, including teachers and nurses, which would involve them being paid more than colleagues if they were deemed to be delivering better results.
A plan for future reform of the public service, which is due to be published early this year, is expected to include details of a performance management scheme to reward high achievers.
Mr Varadkar said they agreed with junior minister Brian Hayes who said that workers needed to be rewarded if they were found to be making a difference in their working lives.
However, they added that it was difficult to remove under-performing workers from their positions and that Public Expenditure and Reform Minister Brendan Howlin would be responsible for making the changes.
“I think there's merit in that (a bonus scheme),” they said. “One of the difficulties we have in the public service that we haven't really changed is there isn't an adequate mechanism to reward people who are doing a really good job, and it's very hard to squeeze out people who aren't doing a good job or not performing or have a chip on their shoulder or whatever.
“It's absolutely the case that there are mechanisms in place in the public service to promote people, promotion is now done on merit. And there are mechanisms in place to squeeze people out, but it's not the same as it is in the private sector. We don't have the same tools that exist in the private sector but that's a matter for government.
“The next stage of public sector reform isn't going to be about pay cuts, it's going to be about better services for people and, in that context, Brian Hayes's proposal to reward people who are doing a very good job is a good one.”
Bonus schemes were a feature in the pay of some public sector workers during the Celtic Tiger era, and have been criticised amid concerns they do not properly assess the work completed by civil servants.
Last month it emerged that the majority of civil servants were ranked as “exceeding the required standard” in 2012, with fewer than 1pc assessed as needing improvement.
Any proposals for a performance scheme would require negotiations with unions and could also leave the Government open to allegations that the measures were being introduced as part of an election campaign ahead of next summer's local and European elections.
Fianna Fail claimed the move was an attempt by Fine Gael to “win votes” in advance of the local elections, saying the move smacked of electioneering.

Drawing of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (Photo/Xinhua)
1. Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge
The assembly of the first curved section of the underwater tunnel for the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge was successfully completed on Oct. 8, 2016. Hailed by The Guardian as "one of the seven modern wonders in the world," it is the world's longest bridge currently under construction.
Starting from Lantau Island in Hong Kong, the Y-shaped bridge will boast a total length of about 55 kilometers, including a 6.7-kilometer underwater tunnel and a 23-kilometer bridge over the sea. Artificial islands will be built at both ends of the tunnel to allow for the passage of large ships.
The bridge will serve as an important channel linking Hong Kong, Macau, Zhuhai and the western part of the Pearl River Delta, one of the most economically developed areas in the Chinese mainland.
Construction of the bridge started in 2009. Its total cost will come to some 10 billion RMB ($1.5 billion). It is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. Once in operation, the commute time between Hong Kong and Zhuhai or Macau will be reduced from three and a half hours to just 30 minutes.
NEW BRUNSWICK – While millionaires are increasingly in short supply in the Garden State, demand for wealthy benefactors among Rutgers University students is on the upswing. Or so says the company behind the dating website designed to bring the two together.
In 2014, the number of Rutgers University students who joined seekingarrangement.com, whose backers tout it as the world's largest "Sugar Daddy" dating site, rose by 32 percent, according to data released by the website.
Founded in 2006, the online dating website offers cash-strapped college students the chance to enter into what the company's press kit says are "mutually beneficial" arrangements with more financially secure persons. Students are attracted to the website by the average $3,000 in monthly "allowances" provided by their matches.
A total of 317 Rutgers students have registered profiles with seekingarrangement.com, a spokesperson for the site said. How many of those are active users is unclear. The number represents less than one percent of the university's total population of enrolled students, which stands at 40,720 for the 2014-2015 school year.
Still, with last year's growth, Rutgers has shot into the top-50 on the website's annual ranking of the fastest growing "Sugar Baby Schools," which was released by the website last week.
The rising cost of tuition at Rutgers and universities nationwide, and the lack of congressional action on the issue of student debt, has led to a 42 percent increase in college student signups, according to SeekingArrangement CEO Brandon Wade.
Last July, the Rutgers' board of governors voted unanimously to hike undergraduate tuition and fees 2.3 percent on the state university's New Brunswick campus. Students attending the main campus in New Brunswick and Piscataway who live in New Jersey are paying $13,813 in tuition and fees for the 2014-2015 school year.
Calls for comment to the university were not immediately returned.
"While other countries seek to create opportunity and provide a better start for students by abolishing tuition fees or lowering them to reasonable amounts, Congress continues to ignore the problem," Wade said. "The average debt is more than what most of these new graduates make in a year."
The sheer amount of loan debt being carried by students may help explain why some students in the Garden State are turning to alternative funding methods to offset the cost of a higher education, says Barbara O'Neill, a Rutgers professor of financial resource management.
"People are anxious," they say. "It's like a sword hanging over them. If young adults don't have the wherewithal to make payments on debt, it's going to affect all of their decisions moving forward."
New Jersey ranks in the top-10 in terms of the highest amount of loan debt owed by higher education students. Higher education students who graduated from New Jersey institutions in 2013 owe an average of $28,109 in loan repayments, according to a study by the Project on Student Debt.
And many of those students are going into default. Recent studies by the U.S. Department of Education analyze the default rate of students in a three-year student cohort per each fiscal year. Of the 82,185 New Jersey students who had in fiscal year 2011 received a federal student loan, 8,741 defaulted within two years of the start of their repayment period.
That puts the the default rate for students attending four-year colleges in New Jersey at 10.6 percent, according to the most recently released numbers.
The national student loan default rate stands at 13.7 percent.

The latest round of trade tariffs could create a module supply crunch and clog up the US PV project pipeline, according to SunEdison founder Jigar Shah.
Shah, who is also the President of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy (CASE), has warned that panel prices will rise from next year. This could in turn make some projects uneconomical, while in the future module supply itself could become a challenge.
“The 2012 tariffs will come into [full] force at the end of this year. All of the appeals and so on are exhausted. If the manufacturers have to pay for those tariffs module prices in the US will immediately go up,” Shah told PV Tech.
“This new case will have an influence on the old one because any modules with Taiwanese cells will be subject to the new tariffs. In 2012 SolarWorld wasn't smart enough to include the Taiwanese cells. The Department of Commerce has used unprecedented power, to our knowledge, to actually widen the scope of the trade case beyond what SolarWorld asked for. So starting 1 January next year we will have unprecedented increases in modules prices,” they said.
Shah predicts increases of around five cents per watt resulting in some utility-scale projects no longer being viable.
With the US set for a spike in demand in 2016 ahead of the Investment Tax Credit falling from 30% to 10%, Shah is concerned that US will not be first choice for manufacturers that are able to pick and choose where they export to.
“That's the amazing thing, solar is becoming the largest business in the electrical generating sector and the US, which is manufacturing a shortage of panels, is going to become the least friendly market to export panels too,” Shah said.
Shayle Kann, senior VP at GTM Research, predicted smaller panel increases but a similar end result.
“We are looking at likely flat to slightly increased pricing in the US while the rest of the world sees price declines,” Kann told PV Tech. “And flat pricing alone is enough to render uneconomic a number of utility-scale projects in the US, many of which are operating under razor-thin margins.
“With regard to a 2016 module shortage, it depends on how demand shakes out in the rest of the world. 2016 will certainly be a boom year for US solar demand ahead of potential ITC [Investment Tax Credit] expiration, so there will be a huge need for module capacity to serve demand. And while there will certainly be more than enough technical capacity to serve that demand, it is true that other markets, such as Japan, could be preferential for suppliers if they are strong enough to enable full supplier utilisation.
“So regardless of whether a shortage does occur, the price of available supply will be just as important and will certainly be impacted by the new round of tariffs,” Kann concluded.
This impact could mean a weakening of US firms' bargaining position when negotiating pricing and reduced choice as some firms able to sell their full output opt for tariff-free export markets.
Cost
The additional costs will not be passed on to investors who Shah says will expect to continue to be offered quoted prices. That leaves the industry to absorb the costs.
A frustrated Shah expressed concern that this could create uncertainty come 1 January while attempts, if any, are made to find a settlement. This process would likely take four to six months.
“That's unacceptable - 150,000 people, many of whom are blue collar workers will not know whether they have a job that day. That is ridiculous,” said Shah.
So who does benefit from the decision?
“Nobody. There's not single person who will win out of this. This is just going to leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth. The only person this is good news for is Frank Asbeck but I don't think it is good news for their shareholders,” said Shah.
(CNN) Ted Cruz asked their communications director Rick Tyler to resign Monday after Tyler distributed a video that falsely depicted Marco Rubio dismissing the Bible.
The incident comes a day before the Nevada Republican caucuses and in the wake of accusations from rival campaigns in recent weeks about Cruz's campaign tactics. Donald Trump has called Cruz a "liar" and Rubio and Ben Carson have also blasted the Texas senator.
Trump, Rubio and Carson have all attacked Cruz for their ethics ever since Cruz's victory in Iowa. Cruz later underperformed in South Carolina two contests later.
Cruz says they spent the morning investigating what happened before making their decision. Campaign manager Jeff Roe confirmed that Tyler had formally resigned.
"I have made clear in this campaign we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards and integrity," Cruz told reporters Monday, adding that Tyler is a "good man."
"This was a grave error of judgment. It turned out the news story they sent around was false but I'll tell you, even if it was true, we are not a campaign that is going to question the faith of another candidate," Cruz said.
A former, longtime spokesperson for Newt Gingrich, Tyler was a senior aide and one of the Cruz campaign's first hires in the run-up to their presidential announcement.
According to MSNBC host Kate Snow, Tyler abruptly left the studio just as they were about to go on air.
"He actually abruptly left just before we were about to go live to them and now we know why," they said on air.
JUST IN: @tedcruz asks for the resignation of spokesperson Rick Tyler. https://t.co/HmEOskR0VR — MSNBC (@MSNBC) February 22, 2016
Tyler had apologized late Sunday for the incident.
"I want to apologize to Sen. Marco Rubio for posting an inaccurate story about them here earlier today," said Tyler, the spokesperson, wrote in a Facebook post
The latest dust-up comes as the two senators' campaigns have been clashing heatedly for days about "dishonesty" and "lies" on the trail.
Trump immediately sought to capitalize on the moment.
"Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire their Communications Director. More dirty tricks!," they tweeted.
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2016
Speaking at a campaign rally on Tuesday, Trump added that they thought Tyler was "a decent guy" but they were "taking orders from Cruz folks."
And Rubio's campaign similarly rubbed salt in the wound, praising Tyler's skills but saying they "had the unenviable task of working for a candidate willing to do or say anything to get elected."
The story mentioned by Tyler was about a video that shows Rubio walking into a hotel lobby past Cruz's father Rafael and a staffer reading the Bible, and subtitles in the video misquote Rubio as saying, "Got a good book there, not many answers in it."
In a corrected version of the video tweeted by Rubio's communications director, Alex Conant, the subtitles quote Rubio saying, "Got a good book there, all the answers are in there."
This video has correct transcript; any other is another dirty trick by Cruz camp. How do I know? I'm in the video!! https://t.co/llZGimU5Jp — Alex Conant (@AlexConant) February 21, 2016
Rubio themselves explained to reporters Monday that they were saying the Book of Proverbs is especially helpful.
"I know exactly what I said to that young man. I said, 'The answer to every question you'll ever have is in that book,' and then I pointed to the Book of Proverbs, which they were reading, and then I said 'Particularly that one,'" Rubio told reporters in Nevada.
Tyler continued, "Since the audio was unclear, I should not have assumed the story was correct. I've deleted the post because I would not knowingly post a false story. But the fact remains that I did post it when I should have checked its accuracy first. I regret that mistake."
Rubio said they accept Tyler's apology, but called for the Cruz campaign to hold someone accountable.
"It's every single day, something comes out of the Cruz campaign that's deceptive and untrue, and in this case goes after my faith. So I understand, I guess one of their spokespersons apologized and I'll accept their apology, but this is a pattern now and I think we're now at a point where we start asking about accountability," Rubio said.
The flub by the Cruz campaign comes after Rubio finished narrowly ahead of Cruz for second place in the South Carolina primary Saturday, behind Donald Trump. In the heated contest there, the Cruz campaign was repeatedly accused by both Rubio and Trump for being dishonest and engaging in dirty tactics.
In one incident, the Cruz campaign used an altered photo on an anti-Rubio website showing a smiling Rubio shaking President Barack Obama's hand, which was featured on a page about the "Rubio-Obama Trade Pact," accusing Rubio of casting the crucial vote to pass the Trade Promotion Authority bill in the Senate to give Obama authority to negotiate trade deals more quickly. Rubio aide Todd Harris called the photo "deceitful" in a gaggle with reporters where they distributed a printout of the page.
The Cruz campaign later changed the photo, but said it was obviously photoshopped and not an issue. They have fought back at the repeated accusations of dishonesty from the Rubio camp by saying the senator is "screaming liar" in the face of their record and spreading its own rumors.

SALT LAKE COUNTY, Utah -- The Granite School District Police Department has issued military-grade AR-15 rifles to all of its officers.
The department bought the guns from the U.S. Military surplus system in an effort to better help officers keep children safe.
Since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Colorado, law enforcement officers said they have had to change the way they protect schools.
"Over the past 20 years law enforcement across the country has had to respond to the shootings in the malls, the shootings in schools, the shootings in theaters," said Granite School District Police Chief Randy Johnson. "And to be able to effectively protect the public, we need to be able to match the weapon that is being used by the person that's attempting to do harm. Most often a long gun is being used by these perpetrators."
Johnson said the weapons are just a small part of the plan to keep students safe. The department has also been installing a high-tech camera system in all of the district's schools so it can monitor what is going on from a dispatch center.
It's not every day you're lying on the table in a hospital gown at your doctor's office and they or they suggest that kale might make your ailments disappear. If only…
But for Robert Ostfeld, MD, the director of the Cardiac Wellness Program and associate professor of Clinical Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center, that's kind of what they do. (Okay, it's a little more complicated than that.)
Dr. Ostfeld, who's based in New York City, sees a lot of patients with cardiac issues like heart disease (as well as diabetes). But in addition to prescribing things like cholesterol-lowering meds, they also tell their patients to follow a vegan diet—and he's seen some awesome results.
“Outside of emergency surgery, I've never seen anything come close to the breadth of benefits that a whole food plant-based diet provides,” says Dr. Ostfeld.
“When I got [to Montefiore], I started doing what I was trained to do. I encouraged patients to take guideline-based medications…[but] people weren't get profoundly better. It was after that, I stumbled across The China Study.” (You know, that groundbreaking book that made a lot of connections between food and disease.)
So Dr. Ostfeld decided to start the Cardiac Wellness Program, with the goal of preventing and reversing disease with the help of a whole foods, plant-based diet. We spoke with them about some of their findings and successes.
What kind of results have you seen so far?
“The kind of patient turnaround we see is inspirational,” Dr. Ostfeld says. “It's totally rejuvenated me as a physician.” Some of the symptoms that have improved for their patients include less chest pressure, patients who can now take fewer medications, and better cholesterol levels.
“We had one particular patient go from 19 medications to three, in the course of a year,” they say. Many patients also notice some added bonuses—like better skin (woot!) or chronic back pain disappearing, they say.
So how does it work? I'm envisioning you and your patients happily drinking green smoothies together…
“I'll typically see a new patient in the office for an hour. We'll go through their issues, talk about the whole foods, plant-based diet. We have a session on periodic Saturday mornings where we go into the lifestyle in much more detail. It's an event: We have a nutritionist, we have a patient who's been successful speak, and we serve a lunch—and we don't charge for this. We fund it through tax deductible donations,” Dr. Ostfeld says.
“When patients really embrace it and they feel so much better, they become the best sort of ambassadors for living this way.”
Where do prescription drugs fit in?
None of this is to suggest that Dr. Ostfeld believes diet is the only answer to solving things like heart disease. “We are only lowering doses [of medications] if their blood pressure, etc., are appropriately reduced. We're only going to do things that are medically justified,” they say.
Which includes running all sorts of blood tests after a patient has been following the diet for some time, so Dr. Ostfeld can see the progress and how things are improving.
“Sometimes patients will cry tears of joy with how much happier and how much better they feel,” Dr. Ostfeld says. “Nobody cried tears of joy when I wrote them a script for cholesterol-lowering medication.”
How skeptical are patients and colleagues about the approach?
“I get resistance and push back from both. Sometimes [patients] look at me like I have five heads,” Dr. Ostfeld says. “Disappointingly…the benefits are not well-known in the medical community. Some physicians are very open-minded to it and others are not. We should be open-minded to all things that help our patients.”
And do you practice what you preach?
“After reading The China Study, I changed my own eating habits, too,” they say. “I've been on a whole foods, plant-based diet for about four years. It's wonderful from a healthy, environmental, and ethical standpoint. Those things resonate differently with different people. I like being able to touch on all three of those,” Dr. Ostfeld says. “It also gives me more credibility with my patients when I am also walking the walk.” —Molly Gallagher

The upcoming fourth season of Community may have a short order (13 episodes), may be on Fridays (with a Whitney lead in) and may have seen the exit of creator Dan Harmon. But that doesn't mean it's the final season, NBC brass says.
“We're in a transition with our comedy programming and trying to broaden the audience and broaden what network does,” NBC entertainment chairperson Robert Greenblatt told critics at the Television Critics Association's press tour in Beverly Hills on Tuesday. “Those Thursday comedies, which the critics love and we love, tend to be a bit more narrow than we'd ultimately like as we go forward.”
“Community has been a show that's always on the bubble [to return] and we decided to bring it back again and see what a fourth season would do for us,” Greenblatt continued. “The reason we did 13 episodes [of Community and other shows] is we wanted to get more comedies on the schedule … which isn't to say we couldn't decide at some point to extend those seasons longer.”
As for Harmon's exit, Greenblatt said:
“I think fans of Community are going to get the same show they have loved from the beginning,” they said. “Every so often it's time to make a change with a showrunner … you evaluate the creative … sometimes you want to freshen a show and we decided to do that with Community — no disrespect to anyone.”
Asked if they would categorically rule out a fifth season, Greenblatt said: “I would love nothing more than Community to have a following on Friday and be able to continue [beyond season 4].”
NBC is premiering several new comedies this fall, including broad and wacky titles like Animal Practice and Guys With Kids, as well as potentially more risky shows like the Matthew Perry therapy sitcom Go On and Ryan Murphy's unconventional family comedy The New Normal.
“We're in this awkward stage,” said NBC's entertainment president Jennifer Salke. “Some of our new comedies might seem more commercial to you … it's kind of an evolving comedy brand.”
“Shows like Whitney and Up All Night were steps in the right direction and that's why they're back,” Greenblatt said. “It [can] take more than a couple seasons for a show to creatively find itself.”

× Flagstaff Fire showing minimal signs of growth
BOULDER, Colo. — Firefighters gained an upper hand on the Flagstaff Fire in Boulder Wednesday. On Thursday morning, the fire was showing minimal signs of growth.
The fire is now 30-percent contained and the blaze's size is approximately 300 acres. A media briefing is scheduled Thursday at 7:30 a.m.
Favorable weather and effective firefighting efforts has decreased concern that the fire will burn into southwest Boulder neighborhoods. As a result, the city has lifted about 2,400 pre-evacuation notices.
However, fears were apparent most of Wednesday as stubborn spot fires burned closer to several neighborhoods including Devil's Thumb, Highland Park and Shanahan Ridge.
“I was out here a half hour ago and there was no smoke in the area. Now, there are flames there,” said Devil's Thumb resident Jackie Jimmerson, whose home sits on open space leading to Bear Peak, where the fire started.
Jimmerson's home is just a half-mile from the base of the mountain where fire commanders dispatched six aircraft to battle the flames, up from five on Tuesday.
There are 250 firefighters are on the scene.
“We do have a defensible area, city open space, so houses don't abut next to the tree line,” Commander Rick Brough with Boulder County Sheriff's Office said.
Official updates from Boulder Office of Emergency Management
LONDON (Reuters) - European Central Bank officials are unlikely to make any change in policy on Thursday, while data from the United States will help the Federal Reserve decide whether to immediately follow December's rate increase with another.

Recent data from the euro zone suggests the bloc's economy ended 2016 on a solid footing, and last month the ECB surprised markets by saying it would trim its monthly bond purchases to 60 billion euros ($63.86 billion) starting in April.
So none of the economists polled by Reuters this week expect any change at Thursday's meeting. They were unanimous in saying the ECB's next move, after April's planned cut, will be to taper quantitative easing further [ECILT/EU].
“Next week's ECB meeting should be a non-event. After the December decision to extend QE at a slower pace, the ECB is almost on an autopilot for the rest of 2017,” said James Knightley at ING.
However, a rebound in prices in December is reviving calls for the ECB to taper its bond purchases, particularly in Germany. Many Germans feel low rates are eating into their savings and fuelling a property bubble while inflation is already close to the ECB's target of almost 2 percent.
But protectionist sentiment is growing after Britain voted to leave the European Union and Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Several elections in EU countries this year could have far-reaching political ramifications and even threaten the euro zone itself. That is likely to stay the ECB's hand for now.
In the press conference after the policy announcement, ECB President Mario Draghi will probably also face questions over the hacking of their email account during their tenure as governor of the Bank of Italy.
It is not yet clear what the hackers got their hands on. But the idea of a leak of sensitive information ranging from monetary policy to emergency measures for Greece will be of concern.
TRUMP STUMP
ECB officials are growing increasingly worried Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential race may harm the euro zone by hurting trade with the U.S and fuelling populism.
Speaking publicly and behind the scenes, officials emphasize any U.S. shift toward protectionism could hurt the already fragile euro zone economy and pave the way for an even stronger backlash against globalization and the euro project.
Trump gave little new policy information at a press conference on Wednesday, but their protectionist statements have kept many investors from adding to risky positions.
The president-elect has threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on China, build a wall along the Mexican border and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Before Trump's inauguration on Friday, and their next policy announcement on Feb. 1, several Fed policymakers are due to speak, and they are likely to send an upbeat message.
Inflation, industrial production and housing-start numbers are all expected to signal a strengthening economy, giving the Fed scope to follow-up December's rate increase with more tightening this year.
Its Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike twice more in 2017 and recent comments from policymakers suggest there could be a third move too. [FED/R]
“The FOMC continues to predict only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the economic agenda of Trump's administration,” Credit Suisse economists told clients.
“We continue to see two additional hikes in 2017, but acknowledge that the outlook is subject to change in months ahead.”
BEGINNING OF BREXIT
Britain's shock decision in June to leave the European Union has sent sterling tumbling. Although the economy has so far fared better than expected, inflation numbers on Monday will probably show prices jumped in December as imports became more expensive.

Prime Minister Theresa May has said they will trigger Article 50, starting the formal withdrawal from the EU, by the end of March. Many think they will take a hard line on immigration at the cost of Britain's access to the single market, hindering trade.
“The government has sent clear signals that the UK will leave the Single Market, a so-called ‘hard Brexit',” said Sarah Hewin at Standard Chartered.
May is due to speak on Tuesday, setting out the approach their administration will take to Brexit. If they do indicate away from a soft Brexit, sterling will probably fall further.

Half of U.S. Farmland Being Eyed by Private Equity
WASHINGTON, Feb 19 2014 (IPS) - An estimated 400 million acres of farmland in the United States will likely change hands over the coming two decades as older farmers retire, even as new evidence indicates this land is being strongly pursued by private equity investors.
Mirroring a trend being experienced across the globe, this strengthening focus on agriculture-related investment by the private sector is already leading to a spike in U.S. farmland prices. Coupled with relatively weak federal policies, these rising prices are barring many young farmers from continuing or starting up small-scale agricultural operations of their own.
"This is no longer necessarily about food at all, but rather is a way to reap financial profits." -- Anuradha Mittal
In the long term, critics say, this dynamic could speed up the already fast-consolidating U.S. food industry, with broad ramifications for both human and environmental health.
“When non-operators own farms, they tend to source out the oversight to management companies, leading in part to horrific conditions around labour and how we treat the land,” Anuradha Mittal, the executive director of the Oakland Institute, a U.S. watchdog group focusing on global large-scale land acquisitions, told IPS.
“They also reprioritise what commodities are grown on that land, based on what can yield the highest return. This is no longer necessarily about food at all, but rather is a way to reap financial profits. Unfortunately, that's far removed from the central role that land ultimately plays in terms of climate change, growing hunger and the stability of the global economy.”
In a new report released Tuesday, the Oakland Institute tracks rising interest from some of the financial industry's largest players. Citing information from Freedom of Information Act requests, the group says this includes bank subsidiaries (the Swiss UBS Agrivest), pension funds (the U.S. TIAA-CREF) and other private equity interests (such as HAIG, a subsidiary of Canada's largest insurance group).
“Today, enthusiasm for agriculture borders on speculative mania. Driven by everything from rising food prices to growing demand for biofuel, the financial sector is taking an interest in farmland as never before,” the report states.
“Driven by the same structural factors and perpetrated by many of the same investors, the corporate consolidation of agriculture is being felt just as strongly in Iowa and California as it is in the Philippines and Mozambique.”
As yet, the amount of U.S. land owned by private investors is thought to be relatively low. The report points to a 2011 industry estimate that large-scale investors at the time owned around one percent of U.S. farmland, worth between three five billion dollars.
Last year, however, another industry analyst put this figure at around 10 billion dollars, suggesting that the institutional share of farmland ownership is rising quickly.
“We've been seeing a decimation of the family farmer for a long time, but now these processes are accelerating,” Mittal says. “We need a tightening at the policy level before we're swamped by these trends.”
Demographic collision
In the year after food prices suddenly rose in 2008, global speculation in land rose by some 200 percent. With the international financial meltdown coinciding almost simultaneously with this crisis, investors have increasingly viewed agricultural land as a relatively safe place to put their money amidst rising volatility.
In the United States, investors are particularly eyeing potential future returns from mineral prospecting, water rights and strengthening trends in meat consumption. U.S. farmland is also seen as globally desirable due to a combination of high-tech farming opportunities and lax regulations regarding the use of genetically modified crops.
As a result of this new interest, land prices in the United States have risen by an estimated 213 percent over the past decade. This could now play into two trends at once.
Already, the United States is home to relatively low numbers of farmers, with the country famously home to more prisoners than full-time agriculturalists. But those who do continue to farm are also quickly aging.
While federal agriculture officials are expected to offer updated demographic information within the coming week, the most recent statistics suggest that just 6 percent of farmers are under 35 of age. Further, some 70 percent of U.S. farmland is owned by people 65 years or older.
“The older generation needs to cash out because they have no retirement funds, even as the new generation doesn't have the capital to get into the kind of debt that [starting a farm] requires,” Severine von Tscharner Fleming, a farmer and co-founder of the Agrarian Trust, a group that helps new farmers access land, told IPS.
“Today there is a huge number of older folks trying to decide what to do with their land, and in many places we don't have many years to help them make that decision. So in that sense there's an urgent need, and we don't have many tools at the federal level to help.”
For the most part, Fleming suggests, U.S. federal agriculture policy today is not aligned to the country's best interests, instead pointing away from greater agricultural diversity, regional resilience and greater strengthened opportunity for rural economies. Nonetheless, they say that their organisation is encountering a surge of attention from young people that want to start their own farms.
“Over the past seven years, we've had an explosion of interest in being trained as a farmer and entering the trade of agriculture, and this is very much related to the crises around the banks and the environment,” they say.
“The problem we're facing is not one in which nobody wants to farm, but rather the fact that the U.S. economy is structured in such a way that makes it really hard to start a farm in this country.”
Spoiler Alert: The story includes details about the Season 8 premiere of CBS' Blue Bloods.
CBS' veteran drama series Blue Bloods is down a Reagan.
In a surprising twist, it was revealed during the Season 8 premiere of the cop family drama that NYPD Detective Danny Reagan's (Donnie Wahlberg) wife Linda, an ER nurse, had died in a helicopter crash while on the job.
That marked the exit from the show of Amy Carlson, who played Linda since the pilot. They were recurring the first season and a series regular since Season 2. When their character's fate was revealed on the show, Carlson took to social media to post a note to their fans about their departure from Blue Bloods.
“I'm proud of my contribution to building this series,” they wrote. (read their open letter in full on right.)
I hear Carlson had fulfilled their contract, which was up at the end of Season 7, and felt it was time to move on. Still, this was a rather abrupt exit, with their character not getting a proper sendoff, a move that has been met with disapproval by some fans.
This is a rare departure for the long running, much watched, and fairly cast-consistent Tom Selleck-led NYPD family drama. It's a departure that is all the more narratively expeditious with the character's chopper demise – an event seemingly unrelated to the torching of their house by a Mexican drug cartel at the end of Blue Bloods' Season 7 last May.
With the shocker revealed in a therapy session of the eldest surviving Reagan son in the Season 8 opener, the fallout from Linda's death seems set to resonate for the rest of the season.

Viewers who stream network TV shows may soon discover the free ride is not so free.
Hulu, which attracted 31 million unique users in March under a free-for-all model, is taking its first steps to change to a model where viewers will have to prove they are a pay-TV customer to watch their favorite shows, sources tell The Post.
In fact, the move by Hulu toward the new model — called authentication because viewers would have to log in with their cable or satellite TV account number — was behind the move last week by Providence Equity Partners to cash out of Hulu after five years, these sources said.
And it's not just Hulu making it tougher for cable-cutters to stream shows and other content.
Fox, owned by News Corp., which also owns The Post, is expected to begin talks soon with Comcast on a TV Everywhere deal that will require authentication. Plus, Philadelphia-based Comcast is expected to switch to an authentication model for this summer's Olympic Games (see story at right).
The move toward authentication is fueled by cable companies and networks looking to protect and profit from their content.
The effort comes as entertainment companies continue to face drastic shifts in home viewing habits. Overall spending on home entertainment edged up 2.5 percent to $4.45 billion in the first quarter as a surge in digital streaming — which rose more than fivefold to $549 million — offset a continuing collapse in video rentals, according to Digital Entertainment Group.
Hulu, owned by News Corp., Disney, Comcast and Providence, could see its March audience, as measured by ComScore, shrink after authentication. Hulu racked up some $420 million in ad revenue last year and is expected to do well in this year's ad negotiations.
But the move toward authentication, which could take years to complete, will make cable companies happy because it could slow cord-cutting by making cable subscribing more attractive.
At the same time, networks are asking cable companies for retransmission money, a process that could be more appetizing for Comcast and its rivals if their subscriber base stopped shrinking.
To be sure, Hulu's slow move toward authentication comes amid a jumble of cable and network game plans for streaming — which remain a strategic nightmare thanks to the complicated nature of the TV Everywhere initiative, which is aimed at keeping top shelf digital video exclusive to pay-TV subscribers.
Comcast's own NBCUniversal, for example, has a patchwork approach to authentication.
A Wairarapa teacher has been censured after holding the head of a student who was trying to push another student's head into a desk.
Photo: 123RF
The incident happened more than two years ago at Wairarapa College, where Lesley Davies had taught for more than 10 years.
Ms Davies told the tribunal they did not see their actions as physical abuse and they only wanted to prevent harm against another student.
They said there was no element of anger or aggression in their action.
But the Education Council's Disciplinary Tribunal said while they did not find their actions amounted to physical abuse they were still considered serious misconduct.
"We do find that pushing a student's head in these circumstances is an act that is likely to bring discredit to the profession. Therefore the test for serious misconduct is met," the tribunal said.
As well as the censure, it ordered them to undertake professional development in classroom management.
The president of the Post Primary Teachers' Association, Jack Boyle, said the case brought the wider issue of restraint in schools back into the spotlight.
Last month a teacher who carried a struggling child to a school principal's office was found guilty of misconduct despite the Teachers Disciplinary Tribunal admitting they were in a difficult position.
They said a law change earlier this year had not been followed up with adequate training for teachers and many were unsure what was allowed.
"The missing part is that if there are going to be changes to the way that that law is enforced and it's going to have a knock on effect to teachers' employment then surely professional learning so that teacher's know how to intervene safety would follow on and it just doesn't seem to have yet."
They said most teachers exercised good judgement about when an event required them to step in, but many were not sure how they could now go about doing that.
"I think the judgement's always been there. I'd go out on a limb here and say not every teacher in New Zealand has had training about how to intervene safely, it was just assumed that as your role in the classroom might cause you to jump in safely, when somebody's creating harm or there is a risk of harm, it's how do you do that safely you need the training, rather than the judgement."
Since the law change more than 400 reports have been lodged of teachers using physical restraint.
More than half of Italians say they no longer feel at home because of immigration, according to a study on authoritarian populism in the West.
The survey asked people in 12 European countries if they agreed with the statement: “There are so many foreigners living round here, it doesn't feel like home any more.”
Italy was the only country where a majority of people, 52 percent, agreed with the statement. The French and Germans also polled high with 47 and 44 percent agreeing with the statement, respectively.
Agreement was much lower in Romania, Lithuania and Poland — countries that have experienced far lower levels of immigration.
People who hold “authoritarian populist” views are more likely to agree with the statement. More than 70 percent of Germans identifying as “authoritarian populists” said they no longer feel at home.
“The perceptions individuals have of immigration correlate strongly with whether or not they can be classified, by our measure, as authoritarian populists,” Joe Twyman, YouGov's head of political and social research, said of the findings.

She's a prisoner in their own home.
Katie Holmes fears they can't take one step without a Scientology goon following their every move in a heavy- handed intimidation attempt, multiple sources close to the actor told The Post yesterday.
The pretty actor last night was holed up in their Chelsea pad — terrified that soon-to-be-ex-hubby Tom Cruise might kidnap their little girl, law-enforcement sources said.
Holmes told another building resident of their abduction fear — and that neighbor called police on Friday, sources said.
But without Holmes phoning in the report themselves — and Cruise known to be 2,600 miles away shooting a movie in Iceland — police couldn't take any action.
Managers at Holmes' plush Seventh Avenue building, though, have been put on alert for Cruise or any strangers who might want to get inside, the sources said.
Holmes, who filed for divorce from superstar Scientologist actor Cruise last week, knew this was coming, the sources said.
“Katie saw all the pressure. They [Scientologists] are professionals at pressuring people to be quiet,” said a friend of the actor after their bombshell divorce filing in Manhattan last week. “That's why they did this [filed for divorce] in secret.”
A team of beefy armed men parked themselves in a white Cadillac Escalade outside Holmes' place all day yesterday, snapping pictures of people outside the building and demanding to know who they were.
Cops finally pulled up in a marked NYPD squad car behind the SUV and checked out its Tennessee license plates. The officers said they were acting on complaints of “suspicious activity in a white Escalade” but did not elaborate. They spent about 15 minutes eyeing the SUV before leaving. At least two of the five men sitting in the SUV were clearly packing heat. When asked who they worked for, one wisecracked: “We're waiting for a bus.”
A Holmes rep said the mystery men weren't with the actor.
Cruise's team denied the guards were working for the actor. A Scientology lawyer told TMZ the church is not tailing Holmes.
The actor and their daughter, Suri, were not seen in public all day yesterday.
Now that Suri, is 6, Holmes reportedly wants to take them as far away from Cruise's Scientology pals as possible.
Holmes, who was born in Ohio and raised Catholic, is seeking full custody so that Suri can be shielded from alleged Scientology brainwashing, sources said.
“Suri is at the age where they are going to start educating them in Scientology centers and indoctrinating them into the religion,” Holmes' pal said.
“Katie did convert when they and Tom were married, but they didn't take to [Scientology]. Behind closed doors, and when the private planes and the red carpets were gone, they didn't like it. And they decided they do not want that for Suri. ”
Holmes had been planning their marital escape for weeks, surreptitiously moving with Suri into the Chelsea apartment while Cruise was out of the country.
The box-office superstar Cruise was spotted working on the set of their movie “Oblivion” yesterday in Iceland.
Holmes told their neighbor they were afraid he'd charter a plane to get back to New York.
“[Holmes] did not want that much influence and power and control [from the Church of Scientology] over their child and didn't want to go through with” their education in it, according to Holmes' friend.
“She was not going to let that happen to their daughter. Katie does not want them making all the decisions for their child,” the source said.
Cruise's first two wives, Mimi Rogers and Nicole Kidman, reportedly also had problems with the church's hold on their then-husband.
Another former Hollywood wife, actor-photographer Carmen Llewellyn, who was married to “My Name is Earl” actor Jason Lee — a Scientologist — has said the reprisals are swift and brutal against spouses who leave mates who are in the church.
“I lost my manager and my career,” Llewellyn said in a published interview after their split from Lee. “People didn't return my phone calls.
“Scientologists followed me down the street. They took pictures of my kids. They'd stake out my house, wait until we came our and follow us. They came looking for me to scare me.”
Cruise, who turns 50 tomorrow, and Holmes, 33, were married on Nov. 18, 2006, in a lavish Italian ceremony.
Holmes reportedly signed a prenuptial deal that will give them $3 million for each year of marriage, meaning they could walk away with a cool $15 million — and a mansion in Santa Barbara County, Calif.
Additional reporting by David K. Li
AFP via Getty Images Policemen and a group of migrants stands on the platform at the Swedish end of the bridge between Sweden and Denmark in Malmo, Sweden, on November 12, 2015.
As a former intelligence officer, I am a major advocate of the maxim, “facts matter.” As such, I often find myself cringing when listening to President Trump wax philosophically – and creatively – on any number of issues. The most recent example of this are the president's comments about Sweden, made during a rally before supporters held in Melbourne, Florida this pastSaturday.
“Here's the bottom line,” the president said. “We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden,” Trump said. “Sweden. Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris.”
The president then transitioned into the heart of their message, which dealt with their controversial executive order on immigration. “We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people,” they said. “There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.”
The media – in the United States, Sweden and elsewhere – immediately criticized the president's words, ascribing meaning and intent in an effort to undermine the message and the man, building on a foundation of negative press regarding Trump's stalled immigration order banning persons from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States for ninety days while a plan for implementing the president's vision for “extreme vetting” could be formulated and implemented.
“The comments appeared to refer to recent terror attacks in Germany and elsewhere, but no such attack has occurred in Sweden,” wrote Eric Bradner, of CNN. “Trump's remark is the latest misplaced reference to a terrorist attack or incident by those in their White House. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway inaccurately referred to a ‘Bowling Green massacre' that never took place, and White House press secretary Sean Spicer referred to an attack in Atlanta, later clarifying that they meant to refer to Orlando.”
Steve Benen, of MSNBC, had a similar take on Trump's Swedish reference. “Kellyanne Conway recently made repeated references to a ‘massacre' at Bowling Green that never actually happened. Sean Spicer similarly pointed several times to a terrorist attack in Atlanta that didn't occur. So perhaps it was inevitable that Donald Trump, fresh off their bizarre claims about U.S. murder rates that exist only in their imagination, would point to a Swedish incident with no basis in reality.”
I actually believe Donald Trump did America, and the world, a favor in bringing up the issue of Swedish immigration.
The British press was no less damning in its reporting. “Donald Trump appeared to invent an attack on Sweden during a rally in Florida,” wrote The Telegraph, while the Guardian reported that, “Donald Trump appeared to invent a terrorist attack in Sweden during a campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday.”
Even the Swedes jumped on the bandwagon, with Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom posting on Twitter an excerpt from Trump's speech, noting that democracy and diplomacy “require us to respect science, facts and the media.” Former Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt likewise tweeted, “Sweden? Terror attack? What have they been smoking? Questions abound.”
The problem with the bulk of the reporting on Trump's comments was that it was, simply put, wrong. Even the New York Times – no friend of Donald Trump – was compelled to admit that, “Mr. Trump did not state, per se, that a terrorist attack had taken place in Sweden. But the context of their remarks – they mentioned Sweden right after they chastised Germany, a destination for refugees and asylum seekers fleeing war and deprivation – suggested that they thought it might have.”
If there was any doubt as to what President Trump was actually thinking (vice what reporters thought they were thinking), it was quickly put to rest by the president himself, who tweeted Sunday that, “My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.” They followed that tweet with another on Monday, noting that, “Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!”
The president, it seems, was watching an episode of Tucker Carlson's evening news program, where Mr. Carlson interviewed a controversial right-wing Jewish documentary filmmaker, Ami Horowitz, who had finished a project on Sweden's immigration policy. Mr. Horowitz is a noted Islamophobe whose film seeks to label Sweden as a nation whose pro-immigration policies coddle Islamic terrorism. Their appearance on Tucker Carlson's show was part and parcel of a trend of reporting by Fox News sympathetic to President Trump and their policies, and as such it should be a surprise to no one that Mr. Trump had been tuned in and watching as Carlson interviewed Horowitz.
That President Trump gets some of their information from watching prime time news shows should neither shock nor surprise Americans who are similarly empowered by such information sources; after all, what is good for the goose should be good for the gander. That the president chooses to publicly comment on this information without first vetting it – or, in the president's own parlance, “extreme vetting” it – with the resources uniquely available to him, such as the State Department, the National Security Council, etc., is, at the very least, disturbing.
The president, whether they realize it or not, speaks on behalf of an entire country, and not just that segment of society that supports them and their policies. Even if Mr. Trump is personally sympathetic to the selective and self-serving reporting of Mr. Horowitz and Fox News, they should be assiduous in making sure that, as president, their words leave little open to suggestion by being as precise in fact and context as possible. The fact, however, that President Trump is, and was, not doing so should not come as a surprise to either the public or the media; they consistently campaigned in this fashion during their successful run for the White House, and their actions and words, in transition and during the first three weeks in office, have demonstrated little if any trend away from sustaining that behavior.
That President Trump and the media are currently engaged in a much publicized feud over their respective veracity is well known to all; neither side does itself any service by engaging in actions that only reinforces the talking points of the other side. President Trump should be far more precise and accurate in their facts and commentary, period. The media should likewise limit its reporting to those facts that the president has publicly committed to; Mr. Trump provides more than enough ammunition for fact-based reporters to stay gainfully employed without sinking to the artifice of discerning (i.e., manufacturing) “suggestion” and “intent” behind what the president says. To behave otherwise is to demean the status and value of the Fourth Estate to the American people.
An enemy of the truth is, by extension, an enemy of the American people. Both the president and the media should heed that simple fact, since their future credibility hangs on their perceived adherence to the same. A viable democracy such as the United States requires fact-based debate, discussion and dialogue in order to sustain and further societal growth and health – a static society is a dying society. It is in America's interest to keep evolving as a nation, seeking new solutions to old problems, and to do so in a manner which encourages the frank and open participation by all citizens, whether others agree with them or not.
In this light, I actually believe Donald Trump did America, and the world, a favor in bringing up the issue of Swedish immigration. The inability of the American (and international) media to help facilitate a responsible debate on the subject by reporting on perceived “suggestion” or “intent” behind the president's words, vice the actual words themselves, however, has created a situation where the American people can't see the forest for the trees.
It's not that I agree with the president's immigration policy – I don't. My wife and their family are immigrants (she is a naturalized citizen, their father a green card-carrying permanent resident), and our ability to interact with our extended family abroad is dependent on the freedom of movement between the United States and their native Republic of Georgia. The Georgian Republic is, today, an ally of the United States, its population deeply Christian in religious orientation and as such largely immune to the limitations on immigration proposed by the president.
While I do not share Ami Horowitz's sweeping denunciation of Sweden's experience with Muslim immigrants, I do have an opinion on the issue based upon first-hand experience.
It isn't the impact of the president's proposed policy on a personal level that prompts my opposition, but rather the fact that families like my own will be adversely impacted simply because of geography or religion. America has the ability and resources to deal with the issue of immigration with the precision of a surgeon, excising those who are shown to represent a threat to American security while allowing entry to those who don't; in contrast, Trump's proposed policy represents a hammer-like approach. We can, and should, do better.
The best solutions, however, come only once a problem has been properly defined, and here the problem revolves around both the practical methodologies involved in any vetting of immigrants, extreme or otherwise, and the public perception of the impact upon society that any surge of immigration might have. While I do not share Ami Horowitz's sweeping denunciation of Sweden's experience with Muslim immigrants, I do have an opinion on the issue based upon first-hand experience. In late 2007 I had the opportunity to attend a week-long advanced firefighting academy in Sweden, followed by a 72-hour operational “ride along” with Swedish firefighters in the city of Malmo, Sweden's 3rd largest city with a population of 300,00 – 20 percent of whom are Muslim immigrants.
I spent a decade in the fire service, and had the opportunity to interact with firefighters from across the United States and around the world. I've always viewed the fire service as the true barometer of a society; politicians can sweep inconvenient facts under the rug, while a population can coast through life, deaf, dumb and blind about the real problems that exist out of sight, out of mind. Not so the firefighter (or, for that case, the police officer and emergency medical services.)
These first responders know the truth (sometimes ugly) about the state of affairs in a given community. Is there a heroin problem? Ask the firefighter – they or they will be able to draw a map showing precisely where they respond to calls of that nature. Firefighters know the parts of town that have been hit by unemployment, where medical insurance is non-existent, or where immigrant communities (both legal and otherwise) reside.
If you spend some time in a firehouse, as I have, you get a very accurate readout of the pulse of the society they serve. I was a Bernie Sanders supporter during the last election, but by September 2016 I was telling my friends that Donald Trump was going to win, not because I wanted them to, but because that was the feeling I was getting from the firehouses in the parts of America largely ignored by mainstream politicians – the rust belt of the northeast and Midwest America where support for Trump was directly related to the ills of society firefighters knew existed, and which were not being adequately addressed by the political powers that be.
I never met a society more open-minded and tolerant of outsiders than the Swedes. In Malmo, I was driven around the city by a succession of fire chiefs who proudly displayed the work being done by their municipality to receive and care for the large immigrant policy – primarily Muslim – that called the city home. The front-line firefighters that I met and worked with shared the pride in their city, and Sweden's policy of openness and inclusiveness, shown by their command, but balanced it with a healthy dose of skepticism born of first-hand experience with the ugly side of the immigrant experience.
I personally witnessed the reality of entire neighborhoods in the city where firefighters and police were not welcomed with open arms. While not absolute “no go” zones (the Malmo firefighters, after all, responded to calls in these areas), these neighborhoods were “slow go” zones, meaning firefighters entered with caution. Arson incidents in these immigrant neighborhoods were rampant – I responded to two during my stay, one of which was a school targeted for simply being secular. The firefighters I rode with told of being pelted with rocks while responding to other emergency calls just a week before I arrived, and many times prior. The firefighters spoke of the need for increased outreach to the immigrant community, including trying to recruit immigrants into the emergency response force, but noted that these efforts were stymied by the close-knit nature of many immigrant neighborhoods which made meaningful integration into Swedish society very difficult.
My experience with the firefighters of Malmo in no way validates the reporting of Ami Horowitz, Fox News or any media outlet seeking to paint Sweden as a seething cauldron of Islamic fundamentalism operating in the heart of Europe. What it does do, however, is underscored the reality that when a society undertakes to open its doors to large-scale immigration, there exists the potential for the kind of disruptive, sometimes violent experiences that occurred – and continue to occur – in Malmo – and throughout Sweden as a whole. Rather than being dismissive of the Swedish experience, however, America would do well to reach out to the Swedes for their lessons learned, so that America can proactively address the problems and solutions already identified and acted on by the Swedes.
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said efforts are being made to complete the project by August. (Source: PTI)
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari in a shocking statement has said that they will pour tea into a cup to see whether single drop spills over in order to assess the quality of work, according to the reports by TOI. The Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways and Shipping, gave this statement after taking an aerial survey of the progress on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway near village Jahllaka in Haryana which is estimated to cost around Rs 10,000.
Talking to the news agency PTI after assessing the progress, Gadkari said about 60% of the work has been completed. They said efforts are being made to complete the project by August adding that work on the Palwal-Manesar section of the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal project has been completed. This expressway is likely to reduce the vehicle pressure by up to 50 per cent in Delhi along with reducing the pollution.

Gadkari told the agency that once the work is finished, the vehicles won't have to enter Delhi for mutual transit to the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. The minister lauded the efforts of the Haryana government in completing the work in its territory. The foundation of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway was laid by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2015.
The Eastern Peripheral Expressway would pass through Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautambuddh Nagar and Faridabad. As part of the project, 222 structures out of 339 to be constructed such as bridges, interchanges and over-bridges have also been completed, they said. In addition to the construction of main bridges on Yamuna river, Hindon river and Agra canal, eight railway over-bridges, four over-bridges, 45 small bridges, 77 underpasses and 152 pedestrian underpasses are also part of the project.
ANTAKYA, Turkey -- Haj Faraj is fed up. The 36-year-old Syrian rebel commander, who says they lead a small brigade of 50 fighters just over the border, is angry, nearly broke, and more worried than ever.
For much of the Syrian civil war that has now claimed more than 140,000 lives and displaced millions, the commander and their men were part of an independent, moderately religious unit in coastal Latakia, a province largely controlled by the Syrian regime. But eight months ago, cash-strapped and disenchanted with what they deem a corrupt and disconnected Western-backed political opposition, Faraj says they and their brigade joined the ranks of Liwa Al-Ashr, a larger, fiercely Islamist rebel group.
"If you are a tool in someone's hand, you will live luxuriously," Faraj says, sitting in their simple home that houses several Syrian refugee families in this border city. "But if not, you are poor."
As the Syrian civil war enters its fourth year, what started off as a pro-democracy uprising has morphed into vicious combat, including fights between rebel groups that range from Western-backed secular fighters to extreme Islamists. The fractured opposition has become largely dominated by hardline Islamist groups like Liwa Al-Ashr. In turn, more and more commanders like Faraj are now making the move from moderate groups into the Islamist camp, hoping to gain support and halt the disarray that has allowed President Bashar al Assad's regime to take the offensive.
Faraj says the groups that seek to violently enforce strict Islamic law are undermining the efforts of other rebels who, while also religious, do not follow the same interpretation of Islam. And yet like many others, their desperation for arms and support outweighed their aversion to joining these groups.
"Syria will not become an Islamic state," they say loudly, as if trying to convince himself.
Faraj's move is a risky one. They believe the regime will eventually fall and that the Islamist groups will start a second war based on religion, but decided that joining up with them was perhaps the only way to help defeat Assad.
Before the war, Faraj was a boat operator who spent their days on the Mediterranean Sea making a meager living. While life may have been simpler back then, they lament that they were never really free. “We lived in a depression in Syria,” they say. “We wanted to start a revolution.”
When protests erupted in Syria in the spring of 2011, Faraj says they were one of the first in their small village in Latakia, just 60 miles southwest of Antakya, to give up on peaceful demonstration and turn to the only form of protest they thought might bring real freedom: armed resistance. As the war dragged on, one by one, Faraj watched as their neighbors and friends left for safer ground. Now, their hometown is nearly deserted, they say.
When Faraj is not crouched in mountain passes with a Kalashnikov rifle resting on their shoulder, they cross the border to re-group and plead for more money from rebel and political opposition groups to adequately arm and train their men.
Their fight is a family affair. They and their seven brothers have fought together for three years, though they say one died recently in a regime prison, and they all followed them in joining Liwa Al-Ashr. Their 19-year-old nephew, Ahmad, also took up the fight after Faraj gave them a 15-day crash course in warfare.
Haj Faraj clicks through photos on their laptop, pausing at one of their late brother who they say died recently in prison.
"Most of these groups are based on very local politics," said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and director of Oklahoma University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies. "They emerge out of a town, out of a family. They act as an independent unit and they become supreme in their quarter square kilometer in Syria."
So far, Faraj hasn't benefited from joining Liwa Al-Ashr. He's still desperate for cash. Recently, they had to sell some of their weapons to pay off debts from other groups who loaned them money, only amplifying their dire need for arms.
And what was a last-ditch effort to give their brigade a better chance at surviving could now be the reason they lose key battles -- or their life. Like many other small rebel brigades that team up with larger groups for money and support, he's lost their autonomy.
"When you need to raise money, you have to go out and pass around a hat," Landis said. "And that requires that you give loyalty to some other bigger fish. It is a lot like a feudal system. This little guy who may be in charge of their village can't remain independent. And once you team up and you get some bigger commander, they may screw your village."
Though Faraj is a deeply religious man, they say they feel disconnected from Liwa Al-Ashr because of its extreme ideology.  They are discouraged by the group's alliances, such as its joint operation with Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda's Syria branch that has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S. Department of State.
They say Jabhat al-Nusra is comparable to an even more extreme al-Qaeda offshoot, the Islamic State of Iraq and Islam, known for kidnapping and killing critics of Islam. The group repeatedly clashes with other Islamist rebel groups, vying for both land and power. Intra-rebel conflict since early January has claimed more than 3,000 lives.
Faraj feels further detached from Liwa Al-Ashr's because of its promotion of sectarian violence. The group's Facebook page is flooded with examples of extreme violence against Assad's Alawite minority religious sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam with a strong base in Latakia.
"After we're done with the regime, we'll have another war," Faraj says.
The Western-backed political opposition has done little to alleviate the rebel infighting, Faraj says. The group, called the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, is at odds with most of the religious rebel groups in Syria. Many rebels slammed its decision to head to Geneva for peace talks earlier this year and collaborate with the United States.
"The political opposition is just talked, just a shadow over us," Faraj says as they click through photos on their laptop. One picture is of a young Ahmad posing with a Kalashnikov. The next is of another nephew who they say was captured and burned alive by the regime after a battle. They stop at the last photo for a few breaths. It's a picture of their dead brother.
"I tried to contact opposition funders, but they all shut their doors," they mutter, shaking their head.
The commander takes particular issue with Ahmad Jarba, the leader of the political opposition, and rebel leaders like them who they say lead "luxurious lives" outside of Syria while rebel fighters on the ground suffer immensely.
"You've got this handful of well-educated Syrians who know how to speak to the State Department and CIA officials," Landis said. "They're being trotted around and put on stipends. And then you have these guys living hand to mouth. And they've had it."
"They can't even play the game of lying about tolerance and democracy," they continued. "The guys in the fancy hotels can because they've never been on the battlefield. They've gotten their families out. But these other guys are getting barrel bombed in their villages."
Faraj says that personal vendettas and battles for power among opposition leaders and brigades are killing the revolution. But he's not ready to give up the fight just yet. They can't imagine the alternative of laying down arms for good and joining their family in Turkey as a refugee.
Sitting next to Faraj is their young bride who they married just five months ago. They look at them like she's the only one in the room. Every time they leaf, they say they don't know if he'll ever see them again.
"Maybe I'll be shot," they say as they move a bird cage holding canaries to their open window. When he's home in Antakya away from the fighting, they spend hours sitting in their living room listening to the birds. He's teaching them to sing because the sound calms him, they say in a rare break from talk of war.
But then, they pause, as if remembering their own reality.
"When you go to the coast, you make a sand castle," they say, alluding to the years he's spent fighting, seemingly in vain. "And then the water comes and destroys it like you didn't build anything at all."
Bitcoin price: $238.59 (£154.93, €218.65) via CoinDesk.com
Dogecoin has surged in price by more than 15% over the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap up above $16m for the first time since January.
Meanwhile, bitcoin has continued its recent run of stability, shifting in price by less than 0.5% since yesterday to remain around $238. This movement was mirrored by litecoin.
UK government advised to regulate bitcoin wallets
Management consulting firm Accenture advised the UK government to apply regulation to bitcoin wallets in the same way it does for bank accounts.
Freedom of Information request by CoinDesk unearthed documents that revealed the company warned of the risks associated with digital currencies during the Treasury's call for information in 2014.
"Digital currencies are at an early stage of development and usage but they are here to stay and the technology has the potential to reinvent many aspects of financial services," the advisory stated.
"Heavy regulation (or application of historical frameworks) could stifle innovation – to avoid this, an agile regulatory regime should be set up to be flexible and develop specifically for digital currencies as the digital currency economy grows."
Kraken launches bitcoin margin trading
San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken has announced the launch of margin-trading, allowing clients to trade bitcoin against the euro.
"Opening a margin position is as simple as toggling a button in the order form to select the level of leverage and all the other order details work the same way they do for normal trades, including the many advanced order types Kraken supports," Kraken said in a statement.
"Initially there is no extra fee for margin trading. You simply pay your normal trade fee on the opening and closing volume of the margin position."
'Life on Bitcoin' trailer released
The trailer for a documentary charting a couple's attempts to live for 90 days using nothing but bitcoin as a form of currency has been released.
'Life on Bitcoin' follows Austin and Beccy Craig as they eat, travel and entertain themselves spending only bitcoin.
The project was funded through a 2013 Kickstarter campaign that raised more than $70,000.
"It's our goal to take care of all of our necessities with bitcoin," Beccy Craig states in the trailer. "We're a digital world now and our currency hasn't been digital."
Spiders and space.
These two things don't come together often, but Twitter recently fostered a bit of synergistic science that has led to an amazing revelation: Tiny jumping spiders can likely see the moon.
And they're not alone among potential stargazing arachnids: Other spiders have visual systems that are sensitive enough to discern celestial objects, experts say.
Raining Spiders
The fun began when Jamie Lomax's office ceiling began raining baby jumping spiders last week.
Lomax, a University of Washington astronomer, and others determined that the spiders were likely Salticus scenicus, a common species referred to as zebra spiders because of their black and white stripes. (Read how jumping spiders can think ahead and plan detours.)
#ItIsRainingSpiders Update: More have been spotted walking around on the ceiling. Suggestions for extermination includes nukes and fire. — Jamie R Lomax ⭐️🔭 (@jrlomax) June 3, 2017
“Do they see in infrared light? They are literally falling/jumping off the ceiling and landing on my keyboard,” they tweeted.
An exterminator arrived and suggested that a nest had perhaps hatched somewhere above the ceiling tiles. After that, it seemed Lomax was spider-free.
But not for long.
WELP, you might still have a chance, since I think I know where they ran to. I've had two climbing up my walls so far today... — Emily Levesque (@emsque) June 5, 2017
Emily Levesque, an astronomer also at the University of Washington, began to experience the same thing.
Laser Beams
Alex Parker, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute, had a suggestion.
Have you tried lasers?
Seriously though, some jumping spiders will chase laser pointers like cats do. — Alex Parker (@Alex_Parker) June 3, 2017
Out came the laser pointer.
When Levesque aimed a red laser pointer near one of the spiders, the arachnid seemed somewhat motivated to meander around and follow the dot. But when they aimed a green laser pointer at the same spider? The zebra spider went nuts, chasing the green spot like it was a cat.
Which Color Laser Pointer Will Best Attract This Spider?
But were the spider's different responses to the laser colors important? What did this impromptu experiment have to say about spider eyes?
This being Twitter, it didn't take long for those questions to find answers.
Spider Vision
“I was watching the Stanley Cup final and then my team lost and I was all sorts of upset about it and was like ‘Aww, I'll check Twitter before I go to bed,'” Morehouse tells National Geographic. “And I had over 100 notifications, and I couldn't figure out what it was all about.”
Then they realized that several astronomers had become fascinated with their interloping spiders and were trying to figure out how spider vision worked. They gleefully dove into the conversation.
They told them jumping spiders have extremely good vision. Their visual acuity, meaning how well they discern two discrete objects, is on par with cats, pigeons, and some dogs—but still not quite as good as us. Jumping spiders need stellar sight to run after and pounce on prey, rather than spinning a web and waiting. (Read: "Surprise: Jumping Spiders Can See More Colors Than You Can.")
Watch: The Sexy Dance Moves of Male Peacock Spiders Jumping spiders, such as this peacock spider, have elaborate courtship dances.
Most jumping spiders can only see essentially two colors: Green and everything else, including ultraviolet.
So, what Lomax and Levesque observed is exactly what Morehouse expected. When Levesque's spider saw a green spot, it naturally decided to stalk and chase it, as all good spiders (and cats) should do.
But without the ability to discern red, the zebra spider perhaps perceived that spot as a dimmer, boring shade of unexciting green, Morehouse says.
Stargazing Spiders
Inspired by the astronomers, Morehouse decided to do a quick calculation about whether jumping spiders can see the moon. After all, their eyes work like little Galilean telescopes.
With a visual acuity allowing jumping spiders to resolve objects 0.07 degrees apart, the full moon—which covers a whopping 0.5 degrees on the sky—would be easy to spot, if the spiders looked up at night.
Not only the moon, but possibly the dark patches on its face that used to be lunar lava seas.
“It just depends on how sensitive they are to the differences in brightness across the moon,” Morehouse says. “But in any event, they should be able to see the moon, they should be able to see that it's round.”
Space and spider scientists then wondered whether any arachnids would be able to see the Andromeda Galaxy, our nearest galactic neighbor, that takes up three degrees on the sky. If it were brighter, we'd be able to see it more easily, but our eyes aren't quite sensitive enough to make it out most of the time.
These nocturnal, big-eyed beauties hang upside down and chuck handfuls of sticky nets at passing insects. Being active at night, their huge eyes are incredibly sensitive to low light levels, so something as dim as Andromeda would pop.
"I Can't Kill Them Now"
“I had never thought to do the back-of-the-envelope calculations about whether jumping spiders could see the moon,” Morehouse says.
“And then it was totally fun for me to begin thinking about stargazing spiders and what they would be able to see if they looked up at night. It's a totally wonderful, fanciful thing.”
And Lomax, whom we can thank for this fantastic intersection of disciplines, seems to agree.
“After all I've learned on Twitter over the past 24 hours, spiders are way more interesting and a little less creepy than I had previously thought,” they say.
School board elections are being held today, but a small segment of registered voters are expected to participate.
“This year alone we have 330 school districts roughly and over 900 school board positions on the ballot and when you only see four-to-seven percent turnout out to vote for this kind of positions, we can do better,” says Secretary of State Paul Pate, “especially when you think about there are 480,000 K-12 kids in our public schools and it's 60 percent of our state budget.”
This is the last time school board elections in Iowa will be held in September. Starting in 2019, school board elections will be held in November, on the same day as city elections. Today, there are many school board members who are unopposed as they seek another term. In addition, Pate says there are a number of ballots which show no candidate filed nominating papers to run, so the school board slot may be filled by a write-in candidate.
“The write-ins tend to have a higher role in some of these elections that have low turnouts,” Pate says.
According to Pate, most of the people who step forward to serve on a school board tend to have children in the district, “or they just have a real strong bond in wanting to see their education system be up to par.”
School board elections are managed by county auditors. Many school districts extend into more than one county. In those situations, the auditor in the county that has the greatest number of students from the district takes the lead in managing the school board election.
“It's just like any other normal election, they'll total 'em up this evening,” Pate says. “Most people, before they go to bed tonight, they'll know who won the school board elections.”
Precincts open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. That's an hour earlier than most elections in Iowa.
Pate mailed in their ballot for the school board election in their home district of Linn-Mar. Pate says the new voter verification procedures for all elections that former Governor Terry Branstad approved this past spring do not go into effect until January.
The head of al-Jazeera has launched a scathing attack on Middle East governments, accusing them of framing new laws giving them powers to close down the Arabic-language news channel and other broadcasters.
Wadah Khanfar, al-Jazeera's director general, said a charter published last week by the Arab League, which represents 22 states in the Middle East, is the most serious threat to media freedom in the region for more than a decade.
The charter calls on broadcasters to avoid insulting Arab leaders, respect Muslim values and uphold the cultural and social traditions of Muslim states, stipulating that satellite TV channels "should not damage social harmony, national unity, public order or traditional values".
It adds that programming should also "conform with the religious and ethical values of Arab society and take account of its family structure".
The charter was adopted by 21 information ministers in a summit last Tuesday in Cairo, with Qatar the only Arab League country to vote against it. The Arab League's council of minsters also approved the document.
Al-Jazeera is based in the Qatari capital Doha and bankrolled by the Emir of Qatar, the kingdom's ruler.
"The document is aimed at the free press in the Arab world," Khanfar said. "It contains very general and ambiguous statements that could be used at any time to close a channel down or take if off air."
In the past, Arab governments have arrested correspondents, closed down bureaux or pursued al-Jazeera and rival broadcasters through the courts.
However, the new document goes much further, according to Khanfar. "Our concern is it puts certain rules and conditions in place," they said.
"Who is going to decide if a leader in a particular country has been 'insulted'? In this region, regimes have never been in favour of a free press or freedom of expression, so to hand over to them the right to decide [who broadcasts what] is very dangerous," Khanfar added.
Most seriously, al-Jazeera believes the charter could give Middle East governments the power to switch off satellite signals and force broadcasters off air. All satellite broadcasters rely on just two groups; Arabsat, based in Saudi Arabia, and Egypt's NileSat.
The Arab League does not have legislative or executive power, but member states are expected to act on last week's document.
"There is no mechanism of implementation but the league is saying it will introduce one in two or three months' time," said Khanfar.
"We are going back in time. We thought we'd left this behind us. Satellite TV has transformed the region into a much more democratic place. We might have expected this 10 years ago but not now after it has become an entrenched reality."
Khanfar said al-Jazeera was considering legal action. "Our lawyers are looking at it and many satellite companies are working to coordinate a position and a response," they added.
In an interview with Mena, the official Egyptian news agency yesterday, Egyptian information minister Anas al-Fiqi defended the charter, saying it was "not aimed at restricting freedom of the media but rather to organise it at a time when satellite channels are spreading ignorant [messages] and illegitimate religious edicts".
Al-Jazeera rose to international prominence after 9/11 when it began broadcasting videos by Osama bin Laden, and is widely criticised in the west, where many politicians and opinion formers regard it as a mouthpiece for al-Qaida, or an apologist for Islamic fundamentalism.
However, al-Jazeera has rarely enjoyed good relations with Middle East governments, many of whom dislike its stated editorial ambition to reflect the views and mood of the "Arab street".

Heart Attack Grill spokesperson dies from heart attack
The second unofficial spokesperson for the Heart Attack Grill in downtown Las Vegas has died from an apparent heart attack.
John Alleman suffered a heart attack last week as they waited at the bus stop in front of the restaurant, located inside the Neonopolis at Fremont Street and Las Vegas Boulevard.
Alleman was taken off life support shortly after 1 p.m. on Monday, said restaurant owner Jon Basso. They were 52.
"He lived a very full life," said Basso, who seemed shaken when reached by phone Monday evening. "He will be missed."
The Pennsylvania native is survived by their only family, their brother Paul. Basso said Alleman had a genetic predisposition for cardiac problems, as both of their parents died of heart attacks in their 50s.
Basso recalled Alleman as a fun-loving man who loved the Heart Attack Grill. The medically themed restaurant is famous for its high-fat menu that includes a record-breaking 9,982-calorie, 3-pound Quadruple Bypass Burger. The grill's slogan is "Taste worth dying for."
Since the restaurant opened in October 2011, Basso said Alleman would stand outside its doors every day, coaxing customers in. Soon enough, Alleman became a fixture at the restaurant they loved, Basso said.
When they aren't working security at an abandoned high-rise construction site on the Strip, Alleman could be found at the grill, talking with customers and eating a burger.
"He never missed a day, even on Christmas," Basso said. "People just loved him. They connected with people in a real way."
Although they were never on the restaurant's payroll, Alleman was everywhere else. Their caricature, "Patient John," graces the front of Heart Attack Grill's menu, clothing line and merchandise.
From time to time, "Doctor Jon" Basso said they would offer a free meal and drink for Alleman's troubles. They always declined, Basso said.
"He never wanted a handout from anyone. They always insisted on paying," Basso said. "He lived, ate and breathed the Heart Attack Grill."
Alleman is the second unofficial spokesperson to die in the restaurant's nearly two-year history in Las Vegas. In March 2011, Blair River — known as the Grill's "Gentle Giant" — died of flu-related pneumonia, Basso said at the time. The 575-pound spokesperson was just 29.
Since then, the Heart Attack Grill had a spate of health-related incidents that seem to live up to the restaurant's fated name.
In February 2012, one man was stricken with what was believed to be a heart problem while eating a Triple Bypass Burger. Two months later, a woman suffered from a similar medical problem while reportedly eating a Double Bypass Burger. It was unclear at the time if their medical issue was related to the food.
Alleman, who weighed about 180 pounds, is proof that heart attacks could happen to anyone, Basso said.
"Heart attacks aren't a laughing matter," they said. "You don't have to be tremendously old or fat. You can be in your 30s and 40s and die of a heart attack."
Although Alleman's death was a "wake-up call," Basso said they won't stop serving Flatliner Fries and the world's "most calorific burger" as long as the public has an appetite for them. The restaurant will have a new spokesperson or woman when they find someone with as much passion for burgers as Alleman, Basso said.
"The grill is where you can be yourself. We accept people as they are," Basso said. "(Alleman's death) isn't going to stop us from what we're doing. People have got to live their lives."
No burial or funeral arrangements have been made yet; however, the restaurant will close that day in Alleman's honor. Basso said they will match dollar-for-dollar any contributions made to offset medical and funeral expenses incurred by Alleman's brother.
Anyone interested in donating money can reach Basso at their email: [email protected]

Youth NCLR Representing Conversion Therapy Survivor who Alleges Sexual Abuse by School Leader After Coming Out
(DeSoto County, MS, August 27, 2014)—Yesterday, the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) helped file a complaint with the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department on behalf of a former student of Bethel Baptist School in Walls, Mississippi who says they were sexually abused for three years by a teacher attempting to “cure” their sexual orientation.
The former student, Jeff White, now 32, alleges that, shortly after coming out in 1996, their parents turned to the local church, which ran a school it promised could “cure” their son and stop them from being gay. Beginning their first-year student year, according to White, teacher Steven Barnes began subjecting White to weekly “counseling” sessions in which they regularly raped and sexually assaulted the teenager to convince them that being gay was more painful than suppressing their sexual orientation.
After more than a decade of emotional turmoil, White heard about NCLR's #BornPerfect campaign to end conversion therapy in five years. They found the courage to come forward because they want to ensure that what happened to them will not happen to other children and to raise awareness about the dangers of attempting to change someone's sexual orientation.
“After growing older and witnessing so many who are still harmed by the church and by efforts to correct homosexuality through traumatic and damaging tactics like the ones used against me, I finally realized that it is my duty to stand up against those who have harmed me,” said White. “By speaking out against the wrongdoings that were committed within the walls of Bethel Baptist School, I hope to shed light on the darkness that is so easily hidden within the church, and to help ensure that no one else suffers the pain that I had to endure. I am extremely grateful to NCLR staff attorney Samantha Ames and the NCLR team for assisting me and so many others who have been hurt by the immoral practices of conversion therapy.”
White is now the executive director of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Rainbow Center, the first LGBT center in the state. Barnes is now the Assistant Pastor at Bethel Baptist Church in Walls, MS. NCLR is joined in this case by Hawkins & Gibson, PLLC, a law firm with a long history fighting for the rights of children abused by adults in positions of authority, including members of the clergy.
In June, NCLR launched the #BornPerfect campaign to protect LGBT kids from the harms caused by attempts to change their sexual orientation or gender identity. NCLR has been at the forefront of the effort to protect LGBT kids from these practices for more than 20 years, successfully working to help draft and pass California's Senate Bill 1172 in 2012, the nation's first to protect LGBT children from the dangers of conversion therapy. The following year, NCLR helped New Jersey pass a similar law and is now working with legislators and LGBT leaders in more than a dozen other states to bring protections to LGBT kids across the country.
Through #BornPerfect, NCLR provides state legislators and LGBT leaders with comprehensive resources and a solid foundation to build statewide campaigns; works closely with state legislators and LGBT leaders throughout the legislative process, including drafting legislation, coordinating hearings with key witnesses, and gaining support to pass legislation; raises awareness about these dangerous practices and the lasting harm they cause in the lives of LGBT children by empowering survivors and providing them with the support to speak out about their experiences; and fights in court for the safety and well-being of LGBT kids.

MIT Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, an initiative they called "our biggest existential threat" in comments at the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics department's Centennial Symposium on Friday.
Musk, who called for some regulatory oversight of AI to ensure "we don't do something very foolish," warned of the dangers.
"If I were to guess what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence," they said. "With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon."
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of research with the goal of creating intelligent machines which can reason, problem-solve, and think like, or better than, human beings can. While many researchers wish to ensure AI has a positive impact, a nightmare scenario has played out often in science fiction books and movies — from 2001 to Terminator to Blade Runner — where intelligent computers or machines end up turning on their human creators.
"In all those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it's like yeah he's sure they can control the demon. Didn't work out," Musk said.
The symposium wasn't the first time Musk raised concerns. In August, Musk tweeted: "We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes."

Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris says they could have played against Newcastle
Hugo Lloris: Tottenham keeper feeling good after being knocked unconscious
The France international was knocked unconscious against Everton earlier this month and the decision to allow Lloris to subsequently play on at Goodison Park drew widespread criticism.
Lloris sat out the Europa League win over Sheriff before being left out of last Sunday's 1-0 Premier League defeat by Newcastle on medical advice.
However, Lloris has been training with the France squad this week ahead of Friday's World Cup play-off first leg against Ukraine and they are ready to play for the national team.
"I feel good," Lloris told a press conference.
"I was unconscious for a few seconds, but I was ready to play last weekend. The medical staff preferred me not to."
The keeper was injured after a collision with Romelu Lukaku and Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas suggested the on-loan Everton striker could have done more to avoid the incident.
However, speaking after Belgium's friendly defeat by Colombia on Thursday, the forward insists it was an accident.
"I didn't mean to hit them on purpose, I am not a player with a bad record," Lukaku told Sky Sports News.
Meanwhile, Lloris is expecting a difficult test against Ukraine, who were runners-up to England in the group phase, when the two sides meet in Kiev for the first leg, with the return in France next Tuesday.
France beat Ukraine 2-0 at Euro 2012 before subsequently finishing second to holders Spain in their World Cup qualifying group.
"This Ukraine side is stronger than the one we beat at the 2012 Euros," added Lloris.
"It will be a battle physically. We need to win it. It's important for the whole country to qualify."
This past week, The Young Turks' Cenk Uygur was off from doing their flagship web show to attend the Sister Giant conference in Washington, D.C. At the conference, they spoke about Justice Democrats, Wolf-Pac, and The Young Turks. But one of the most interesting parts of the speech was when they exposed some secrets of the corporate media.
Cenk Uygur And MSNBC Secrets
In their speech, Uygur discussed their experiences of being shut up by the corporate brass at MSNBC. But they also revealed some other stories, which are not widely known.
One of the stories they told was that of former MSNBC rising star Ashleigh Banfield. After 9/11, Banfield gave a powerful speech questioning the wisdom of the Iraq war.
For that, they were removed from air -- but worse than that, MSNBC wouldn't let them out of their contract so they could go somewhere else.
Uygur also noted that the bosses at MSNBC put Banfield's office in a closet as a scare tactic.
Cenk Uygur also talked about how Bill Press and Pat Buchanan were fired from MSNBC for opposing the Iraq war. Uygur said that Press told them that the execs complained that they aren't being patriotic enough.
And Uygur discussed Phil Donohue and Jesse Ventura, who were also shut down by MSNBC. According to Uygur's account, Ventura said that MSNBC wouldn't let them out of their contract -- they paid them millions of dollars to keep quiet.
The Young Turks and Miracles
The theme of Uygur's speech was "miracles." Uygur began the speech with a short tribute to their parents, who went from an olive farm in Turkey to owning businesses in the U.S. They talked about how they made "miracles" for their family, and for him.
They also spoke about another "miracle:" the growth of The Young Turks, despite the fact that nobody thought they could be successful with it.
The conference, which features such speakers as Bernie Sanders, Dennis Kucinich, and Alan Grayson, is a progressive gathering exploring the "intersection of spirituality and politics."

Abnormal metabolism has been reported in bipolar disorder, however, these studies have been limited to specific regions of the brain. To investigate whole-brain changes potentially associated with these processes, we applied a magnetic resonance imaging technique novel to psychiatric research, quantitative mapping of T1 relaxation in the rotating frame (T1ρ). This method is sensitive to proton chemical exchange, which is affected by pH, metabolite concentrations and cellular density with high spatial resolution relative to alternative techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography. Study participants included 15 patients with bipolar I disorder in the euthymic state and 25 normal controls balanced for age and gender. T1ρ maps were generated and compared between the bipolar and control groups using voxel-wise and regional analyses. T1ρ values were found to be elevated in the cerebral white matter and cerebellum in the bipolar group. However, volumes of these areas were normal as measured by high-resolution T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Interestingly, the cerebellar T1ρ abnormalities were normalized in participants receiving lithium treatment. These findings are consistent with metabolic or microstructural abnormalities in bipolar disorder and draw attention to roles of the cerebral white matter and cerebellum. This study highlights the potential utility of high-resolution T1ρ mapping in psychiatric research.

Carlos Mejia-Bonilla's desperation soared with every phone call to their family from jail.
They were seriously ill and told their family that authorities inside the Hudson County Correctional Facility were not providing the medicine they needed.
Their pleas for help were being ignored, they said.
Two months after their arrest for being in the U.S. illegally, the 44-year-old immigrant from El Salvador was rushed to the hospital. Their longtime girlfriend and their brother were kept in the hallway, barred from their room because they were in federal custody.
Overwhelmed with frustration and concern, their brother, Rey Bonilla, yelled at immigration officers.
“If you want to arrest me, arrest me then,” they said.
They never were allowed in to see the ailing man.
Mejia-Bonilla died the following day, on June 10. Federal authorities listed the cause as “internal bleeding and hemorrhagic shock,” meaning their organs failed because they had lost so much blood.

It took two more days before the jail notified their family of their death.
Since then, two members of the jail's medical staff have been dismissed for "errors" in the case and Hudson County has launched an investigation into the medical care at the facility.
“It's early in the process to get into exactly what mistakes were made, but I think it's safe to say there were some errors made by medical staff that worked at the facility,” said William O'Dea, a Hudson County freeholder.
The claims that Mejia-Bonilla did not receive proper treatment are just the latest in a long and growing list of allegations of medical neglect in the jail's division for people detained on immigration violations, an investigation by The Record and NorthJersey.com reveals.
MEDICAL CARE: Immigrant detainees say they are not getting medical treatment they need
DETAINEE DEATH: A case of mistaken identity, then the death of an ICE detainee
Requests for care have been ignored or delayed, potentially dangerous symptoms have gone unchecked and immigrants have received the wrong medication, according to public records, detainees and advocates.
Across the country, an estimated 41,000 immigrants are being held in federal detention centers as well as in other county jails like Hudson's paid to house detainees. Mejia-Bonilla was the 10th immigrant nationwide to die in custody since October 2016. Two of the deaths were suicides.
While deaths are rare, immigration advocates say reports of substandard medical care, poor conditions and rights violations are widespread in immigration detention facilities across the U.S. There's concern that problems have worsened under the Trump administration, as immigration arrests have increased nearly 40 percent and more people wind up in detention centers.

In New Jersey, detainees are held in the federal detention center in Elizabeth, the Bergen County Jail and the county correctional facilities in Hudson and Essex. “I know there's a lot of focus on Hudson, and it should be. It houses the most people and arguably it's the worst care. But it's really a systemic problem," said Sarah Gillman, a supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society's Immigration Law Unit.
The private contractor hired to provide medical care at Hudson Correctional denies there are problems at the jail. Detainees receive “extraordinary care,” said Al Campana, the chief operating officer of CFG Health Systems.
However, a complaint filed with federal authorities last May noted that 121 detainees reported medical grievances at the jail between January 2014 and March 2016.
HUDSON COUNTY: In case of mistaken identity, ICE detainee dies while in custody
COUNTY REVIEW: Hudson County to review death of ICE detainee
Those grievances included a detainee who was denied surgery for a broken leg and another who was so short of breath and weak from a failing pacemaker that when they were brought from the jail to court for an appearance, a judge called 911.
A third complaint involved a detainee from the Dominican Republic who said a mistake with their medication caused them to bleed internally — and it was days before they were taken to a hospital, where doctors found they had developed a blood clot near their heart. Nelson Fernandez remembers calling their family from the jail to tell them they were extremely ill.
"I even told my daughter, 'Look, if I die, you know they are responsible. They don't want to treat me; they don't want to take me to the hospital,' ” Fernandez told The Record.

Campana said those complaints were investigated by their company and none could be substantiated.
"We do believe that some complaints that come out of there are exaggerated," they said.
They noted that since Mejia-Bonilla's death, their company has taken steps to improve communication to make sure the medical needs of detainees are met.
But detainees and advocates said problems persist. Two immigrants currently held at the jail — one who needs a biopsy and another with a painful leg condition — said they have not received the treatment they need even though they have made repeated requests.
Gerardo Perdomo said they have been waiting for that biopsy for seven months. "It would be terrible if I have cancer and I'm not getting treatment,'' Perdomo said in a telephone interview from the jail.
A history of complaints

The Hudson County Correctional Facility, located in an industrial area in Kearny, holds about 525 detainees a day in a section for immigrants suspected of visa violations and illegal entry. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, pays the county $110 per day for each detainee
The international organization Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups have been issuing reports and warnings about their concerns over medical care at the jail for years. One group that monitors 53 detention centers said Hudson was in the top three with the highest number of human and civil rights complaints — half of them about medical care.
New York Lawyers for the Public Interest zeroed in on problems at Hudson in a report released in February, claiming that seriously ill people were cut off from care or experienced delays in medical treatment. In one case, they said a woman was denied dialysis and blood transfusions for managing a sickle cell condition. On the day of their release, they were hospitalized in intensive care and remained there for two months.
The lawyers also alleged that another detainee's complaints of severe pain from gallstones were dismissed for months. When they were released, they underwent emergency surgery to remove their gallbladder. “The pain and suffering I experienced is something that cannot be expressed in words,” said the man, identified only by the last name Francisco. “I received inadequate health care and almost lost my life."

Last year, Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement and First Friends of New Jersey and New York filed a complaint of medical neglect at the jail on behalf of 61 detainees. The complaint went to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, the Hudson County Board of Freeholders and the correctional facility. It noted that of the 121 people who had filed medical grievances over a two-year period, the jail took corrective action in fewer than 3 percent of those cases.
The allegations of medical neglect included:
An HIV-positive man complained of pain and was told it was hemorrhoids. After multiple requests, they were taken to a hospital, where they were diagnosed with colon cancer. Individuals with HIV are at higher risk of certain cancers, according to doctors consulted for the complaint, and the medical staff should have known a screening was needed.
An elderly woman lost much of their eyesight, claiming that they were denied eye and vision exams while in detention despite repeated requests.
A cancer survivor and diabetic patient suffered rapid weight loss because of insufficient insulin.
A man was denied surgery and physical therapy for a broken leg because the “injury occurred prior to ICE custody."
The advocacy groups also alleged that ICE responded in 2014 to a complaint about Fernandez by saying they would receive appropriate medication and treatment. Instead, they said, they were quickly deported.
CFG Health, a private company that has a five-year, $29 million contract to provide health care at the jail, has a very different perspective on medical care at the facility. In response to the Community Initiatives complaint, Campana said their company reviewed those allegations along with the care of over 300 other detainees — and found that the medical staff provided a high level of care.
"In some of these case the care provided was extraordinary — better than what you and I get," they said.
“There was a lot of documentation ... efforts to provide care and extra visits and to obtain information from other providers," they said. "If we couldn't find them care in jail, we took them to care outside the jail."
If a detainee claims to be sick, the person is seen the same day or the next day by a nurse, who decides whether the case needs to be referred to a doctor or specialist, they said. Campana said off-site care by specialists has to be approved by federal immigration officials and that, in the vast majority of cases, approvals are granted. But that statement appeared to be contradicted by their company's staff, who told a county panel last year that it is “often difficult to obtain ICE's approval for off-site or specialty care or treatment in a timely fashion.”
Campana said they believe Hudson has a high number of complaints because advocates have better access to detainees there than at other jails.
“Hudson County jail allows advocates to come in and meet with people, so you are going to get information coming out of that jail,” they said.
'They wait until something happens'
As part of its investigation into Mejia-Bonilla's death, Hudson County has revoked security privileges for a nursing director and a nurse practitioner employed by the health contractor so that they can no longer work at the jail, said O'Dea, the freeholder.
“The reason given was concerns raised over their performance as it related to this particular case,” they said. They provided no further explanation.
The investigation has since widened its scope to look at the current methods and procedures in place at the facility. “Every individual who enters our custody is entitled to all proper medical care,” said Hudson County Executive Thomas A. DeGise. “We intend to find out whether that was provided — as it should have been — in this case."
Six weeks after Mejia-Bonilla's death, another inmate died — this time a 48-year-old woman housed in the regular division of the facility. Jennifer Towle died in the jail's infirmary while serving a jail term for driving while intoxicated, said county spokesperson James Kennelly.
Spurred by the two deaths, DeGise signed an executive order on July 17 to activate a medical review panel, which will look for a “permanent medical monitor” to regularly review the practices of CFG. “Likely an M.D. whose job will be to review day to day, day in and day out, the medical care,'' Kennelly said.
But advocates believe county officials should have taken action long ago — and they noted that complaints began stacking up years before the county renewed its contract with CFG Health for another five years last July.
“They wait until something happens,” said Chia-Chia Wang, organizing and advocacy director at American Friends Service Committee's Immigrant Rights Program.
Earlier probes by the county into medical care at the jail have done little to fix problems there, advocates said.
Last year, the county reviewed the cases of two patients identified in complaints as well as the records of 50 random detainees. It found that some kiosks for entering sick calls and grievances did not work and some detainees weren't getting medication “in a timely fashion.”
But the panel said there was no evidence that the most serious allegations were true. "We have aggressively investigated all of the detainee advocates' complaints," Kennelly said.
Hudson County has since established a committee with representatives from ICE, the county, the medical company and advocacy groups to meet monthly to talk about medical care issues. Sally Pillay, director of First Friends, a member of the panel, said they are hopeful the effort will finally lead to improved medical care at the jail.

They have made no secret over the years about how the problems at the jail deserved urgent attention. “We believed it could lead to potential loss of life," they said.
That they had pushed so hard to improve care at the facility made the news of Mejia-Bonilla's death all the more upsetting, Pillay said. Now, they are awaiting their autopsy report — and the results of yet another county investigation into care at the jail.
“We want to know if procedures in getting them care were followed,” Pillay said. “We want to make sure that what happened to [Mejia-Bonilla] does not happen to anyone else."

Sony has responded to a House committee query about the breaches of PlayStation Network and Sony Online Entertainment as lawmakers ripped the company's efforts to inform consumers.
The hearing conducted by the House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce focused on the threat of data theft to American consumers.
In a letter submitted to Congress, Sony Computer Entertainment chief Kaz Hirai says the company "has been the victim of a very carefully planned, very professional, highly sophisticated criminal cyberattack designed to steal personal and credit card information for illegal purposes."
Sony turned down a request to attend the subcommittee hearing to continue its investigation into a data breach that knocked out the PlayStation Network on April 19 and Sony Online Entertainment earlier this week.
Their absence did not stop lawmakers, including Rep. Mary Bono Mack, R-Calif., from blasting the company for its slow response to consumers.
"In Sony's case, company officials first revealed information about the data breach on their blog," Bono Mack said. "That's right. A blog. I hate to pile on, but -- in essence -- Sony put the burden on consumers to 'search' for information, instead of accepting the burden of notifying them. If I have anything to do with it, that kind of half-hearted, half-baked response is not going to fly in the future."
In the letter, Hirai says Sony first learned of the breach on April 19, then shut down the PlayStation Network on April 20 due to an "external intrusion." However, Sony did not inform PSN users until six days later that personal data and possibly credit card information was compromised.
On Monday, the company's online branch, Sony Online Entertainment, revealed it had shut down all services due to an intrusion. The breach exposed the personal data of 24.6 million SOE subscribers as well as some financial information.
"Throughout this challenging period, (Sony employees) acted carefully and cautiously and strove to provide correct and accurate information while balancing concerns for our consumers' privacy and need for information," wrote Hirai.
In a summary of its response on the official PlayStation blog, Sony said "intruders had planted a file on one of our Sony Online Entertainment servers named 'Anonymous' with the words 'We are Legion.'"
Hirai said in the letter that Sony is still not certain whether credit card data was swiped during the PSN breach. Earlier this week, Sony dismissed reports that it had been offered a list of credit card numbers for PSN users to purchase.
Hirai also reiterated the additional security measures Sony has taken since the breaches, including enhanced data protection and encryption, more firewalls and the hiring of a chief information security officer.
Sony has not indicated when SOE services will return. On Sunday, Sony said some PlayStation Network services would be back online this week.

Would Russian winger Danis Zaripov fit with the Tampa Bay Lightning? Reports are out that Zaripov will be eligible to play in the NHL and is seeking a contract.
Stephen Whyno with AP News reported today that Russian winger Danis Zaripov will be eligible to play in the NHL and is seeking a contract. While Zaripov has not been connected directly with the Tampa Bay Lightning, yet, Tampa could be considered a possible landing spot for the Russian star.
Previously, Zaripov was suspended by the KHL and IIHF and had their contract with Metallurg Magnitogorsk terminated. They were suspended for testing positive for using the drug pseudoephedrine. However, psuedoephedrine is not on the NHL/NHLPA list of banned substances. After reviewing their case, the NHL determined that they would be eligible to play in the NHL since they would not have been suspended under the NHL's rules.
According to Whyno, Zaripov's agent is Dan Milstein. Milstein is the new agent for current Tampa Bay Lightning forwards Nikita Kucherov and Vladislav Namestnikov. Though Milstein hasn't negotiated with Yzerman on behalf of either player yet, it's likely they have already been in touch with Yzerman since gaining Kucherov and Namestnikov as clients. Milstein was quoted in Whyno's article as saying Zaripov is looking for a place where they can win and a place where they can sign a one-year contract to prove himself.
Zaripov is a left-hander, but has played on both the left and right wings during their career. He's also a winner and will bring a lot of experience. Combining their years in the Russian Superleague, and its successor, the KHL, over 18 seasons, Zaripov has 912 games played to go with 320 goals and 707 points. Additionally they have 73 goals and 151 points in 189 playoff games.
Over their career, Zaripov has won a Russian Superleague Championship, four KHL Championships, one World Championship bronze, one World Championship silver, and three World Championship golds. He's also been a six-time KHL All Star and made first All-Star team twice to go with an MVP award.
While the Lightning's roster seems to be pretty well set, there are some questions about where certain players would slot into the lineup. If Vladislav Namestnikov is the first-line left winger, and Brayden Point is the third-line center, that leaves a fairly big hole on the right wing side behind Kucherov. The options in that case to fill in that slot come down to Ryan Callahan coming back from injury and an unproven Yanni Gourde.
Lining up down the middle with Steven Stamkos, Tyler Johnson, and Brayden Point gives the Lightning a very strong middle. Adding Zaripov into the mix on the right side would strengthen a group of Kucherov, Gourde, and Callahan. Here's a possible line-up inserting Zaripov in:
Vladislav Namestnikov - Steven Stamkos - Nikita Kucherov
Ondrej Palat - Tyler Johnson - Danis Zaripov
Alex Killorn - Brayden Point - Yanni Gourde
Chris Kunitz - Cedric Paquette - Ryan Callahan
J.T. Brown
In this lineup, the team has a strong offensive group on the first line. The second line also can provide plenty of offense and responsible play. The third line should offer some good complementary scoring with three players that can move up to the top two lines in the event of injuries. The “fourth” line would provide one of the best match-up lines in the league, capable of taking on almost any opposition.
The other question to ask is cost, and if the Lightning can afford it. The good thing is that he's a free agent so the Lightning don't have to give up any assets to acquire him. The only cost would be a one-year contract. Yzerman has given themselves some space to work with this season. While using that space would limit what they could do at the deadline, adding Zaripov could be a better option to do now rather than waiting for reinforcements later.
According to CapFriendly.com, the Lightning have $3.25 million in cap space. That can change a little bit though. Erik Condra is currently included on the roster.  They are recovering from back surgery and may not be available to start the season, which would mean the team would have to carry is salary cap hit early in the season. Once he's healthy, they could be sent down to the AHL and give the team roughly $1 million in additional space.
The CapFriendly roster also does not include Mikhail Sergachev. They have an $894,166 cap hit that would bring the available space down to $2,355,834 in cap space. The Lightning have a potential bonus liability of a little over $2 million. If the bonuses paid out at the end of the year forced the Lightning over the salary cap, any overage would be carried over to the next season. Almost half of the possible bonus money comes from performance bonuses for Chris Kunitz. The rest comes from Point and Sergachev.
With Zaripov wishing to prove himself, they could potentially sign for a contract in the $1 to $2 million range. It's also possible that they would accept the low end of that range with the rest being made up for with performance bonuses. That would work out nicely for the Lightning as it creates some in-season cushion with the lower cap hit. It also gives them protection in case Zaripov, who is 36 years old, flames out and can't handle the NHL game.
It looks like there is a fit here in Tampa for Zaripov. The Lightning have the cap space to sign them to a small one-year prove it deal as well as a line-up spot they could help fill. They would also have three Russians in Kucherov, Namestnikov, and Andrei Vasilevskiy on the team to help them with the transition to North America. And the Lightning would offer a chance to win right away in the NHL.
Now the question is if Steve Yzerman and Zaripov agree with me and can come to an arrangement about a contract.

The Catholic church has asked God to ruddy well pull their socks up and stop making gays, as the synod on family issues opens this morning.
A spokesperson for the Vatican said that God was being irresponsible and according to the esteemed book of Leviticus would risk being severely punished by himself. “If they insist on making anything up to 10% of the population gay then we may have no choice but to excommunicate him. And that could mean us not rambling on at them in Latin once a week, so they better take heed” They told us.
The book of Leviticus, which also rules against eating shellfish and bumming a rhino on a Thursday, clearly dictates that a man should not lie with another man unless it is on bunk beds in a youth hostel after a days ruddy cheeked rambling.
“If God themselves doesn't take notice of this then people are just going to think Mr Leviticus has made the whole thing up.” One angry cardinal explained.
Another bishop told us “God might well be moving within the times but you can rest assured that's not going to deter us from our mission of intolerance and wearing silly hats.”
The pope is thought to be wearing a long white dress with smattering of Gold and matching accessories. “He does it so effortlessly” One Bishop told us.
Everton's new midfielder Davy Klaassen has signalled their ambition to win the Europa League with the Merseysiders after coming so close to doing so with former club Ajax last month.
Klaassen, 24, put pen to paper on a five-year deal after Everton agreed a fee of around £23.6m (€27m) with Ajax last week and in doing so became the Blues' second signing of the summer after Jordan Pickford was captured in a deal that could be worth £30m. The club also looked to have wrapped up a third piece of business with Dutch side FC Volendam announcing their youngster Nathangelo Markelo has completed a move to Goodison Park.
Holland international and former Ajax star Klaassen may have just arrived on Merseyside but has wasted no time in outlining their goals for the season and is keen to remedy the heartache of losing this year's Europa League final against Manchester United with their boyhood club by going one better with Everton.
"That [winning the Europa League] would be a really nice way to end my first season at Everton," Klaassen told the club's official website. "It was a great experience [last year]. The further you go in the competition, the greater it becomes.
"It was a great experience for us as a young team and I think we all learned a lot from it."
Many players have found the transition from the Eredivisie to the Premier League to be a bridge too far, but Klaassen is relishing the challenge of playing in the one of the most competitive and intense divisions in the world.
Along with their many seasons playing the best the Netherlands has to offer Klaassen has also plied their trade in both the Champions League and Europa League, and they believe their experiences in both competitions will help them get to grips with Premier League life.
"I think my experiences in the Champions League and Europa League will help me adapt," the former Ajax skipper added. "You cannot compare the Dutch competition to the Premier League, Champions League or Europa League, there's a big difference. We will see how I adapt.
"I'm looking forward to it a lot. It's the biggest league and I always watched it at home. Everyone in Holland watches the Premier League."
The early arrivals of Klaassen and Pickford are evidence of Everton's intent to heavily bolster their squad ahead of a campaign which could prove taxing due to Europa League commitments.
Their spending spree is set to continue with a move for Malaga forward Sandro nearing completion, while Dutch outfit FC Volendam took to social media on Monday (19 June) to confirm the Blues' signing of their young defender Markelo.

Michigan's Supreme Court will soon rule whether or not its state's medical marijuana patients can legally sell cannabis to other patients. As of now, this practice of patient to patient, non-dispensary sales is illegal in Michigan.
The law has been used, in the past, as a way for authorities to shut down dispensaries allowing these transfers to take place. But a case stemming from 2008 involving caregivers that encouraged this practice is now in front of the court, which means the ruling could soon be overturned.
The Supreme Court case involves a dispensary in Mount Pleasant that allowed its members to sell marijuana to each other, with the owners taking as much as a 20 percent cut. The appeals court said the 2008 medical marijuana law does not permit dispensaries. The shop was shut down as a public nuisance. In Livingston County, the Marshall Alternates medical marijuana dispensary in Handy Township was closed following charges against the owners, Christi Marshall and their husband, Alan Marshall, who were each charged with delivering marijuana for allegedly selling the drug to an undercover officer who posed as a card-carrying medical marijuana patient in February and May 2011. [Lansing State Journal]
On the one hand, the couple taking a cut deserves to be penalized for their greed and their stupidity. They're pleading entrapment, which I guess is possible–but them and their associates were also not covered by Michigan's “caregiver registry” when they sold the weed.
Plus, is it really necessary for patients to sell weed to a patient when you're already inside a dispensary? Isn't that what your dispensary is for ? I don't see any merits in circumventing this law–all this couple did was draw negative attention to all collective owners for a stupid 20% cut.
On the other hand (and on a broader scale), there's no reason why two card-holding, legal medical marijuana patients should not be allowed to sell or trade weed with one another. People are going to sell weed to other people via quick transactions no matter what. If you're a patient out at a party late at night and without meds, you're going to ask someone at that party if you can purchase some of theirs. It's human nature and nothing will ever stop that.
Would state and federal authorities prefer people drive under the “influence” of cannabis (or, worse yet, alcohol) to get more of their medicine–or that a patient sitting on a couch next to another patient be allowed to complete a quick and safe transaction?
And because it's somewhat related to this issue, here's one of the greater Curb scenes of all time in which Larry David teaches you how to be as unsmooth as possible when buying your bud:

Voting for the 2016 NHL All-Star Game began in earnest on Tuesday and several familiar names are at the top of the list.
Let's take a look at the leaderboard as of Wednesday morning.
Well, Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin is atop the list, so there's no surprise there. The three-time Hart Trophy winner is followed by Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane, who is riding high on a career-high 20-game point streak.
Article continues below ...
Florida Panthers veteran Jaromir Jagr (and their mullet) is third and Arizona Coyotes forward John Scott resides in fourth.
Wait a minute. Scott is fourth?
The 33-year-old enforcer has recorded one assist and 18 penalty minutes while competing in six games this season. Heck, Scott hasn't played since Nov. 21 in a 3-2 setback to the Winnipeg Jets and has five goals and 535 penalty minutes in 280 career contests.
This is amazing!!! Currently in 4th. John Scott + 3on3 = so many reasons to watch #VoteJohnScott #NHLAllStar pic.twitter.com/R3GTbaf2ca — Ryan Wicklander (@Wicks7Seven) December 2, 2015
A push in social media has aided Scott's cause as #VoteJohnScott has appeared, with fans charting their progress in the early going on the voting.
The 2016 All-Star Game, which will be held at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville on Jan. 31, will have players representing the four divisions competing in three 20-minute contests in a tournament. A semifinal round will then give way to the championship.
The league is banking that the success of the regular-season's 3-on-3 overtime format will carry over to the All-Star Game.

The city Health Department has reported a new case of...
The city Health Department admitted Thursday that it is often unable to identify practitioners who infect newborns with herpes through a controversial ritual Jewish circumcision — because of a code of silence in the ultra-­Orthodox community.
Since 2015, there have been six neonatal cases of herpes linked to the ancient practice known as metzitzah b'peh, which requires a mohel, the person performing the circumcision, to suck blood from the incision on an infant's penis.
But only two mohelim have been identified for endangering the lives of infants since then.
The Health Department has yet to find the mohel behind the most recent case, first reported Wednesday. It issued a statement Thursday night noting potential obstacles to its investigation.
“Identifying a mohel has always been challenging, and it generally takes time,” the statement read.
“Unfortunately, some in the community are resistant. We are hopeful that won't happen with this new case, but we don't know yet.”
The practice has pitted public health officials against leaders in the Hasidic community, who see regulation as an infringement on a religious ritual.
I guess since my previous hat color guessing problem was so popular, I might as well talk about the other one I know. However, this one isn't meant to attack the foundations of mathematics. The problem is as follows:
Three people are sitting in a circle. Black or white hats (50% chance of each) will all be placed on their heads, and they will be able to see everyone's hat color but their own. They will all simultaneously write down on a piece of paper either “Black”, “White”, or “Pass”, trying to guess their own hat color. All the people collectively win (whatever that means) if at least someone guesses their hat correctly and no one guesses incorrectly. They lose if anyone guesses incorrectly, or everyone passes. If they can agree on a strategy beforehand, what is their best chance of winning?
Again, there is the problem that no information can be conveyed to someone about their own hat color, so they would seem to be guessing blindly (talking and facial expressions are prohibited). However, they can still win 75% of the time. Figure it out!
Once you solve the easy version of this puzzle, the harder version is with larger numbers of people. As a partial spoiler, stick to , where the best win rate is out of . How is this possible? (Answer below the fold)
The trick to the puzzle is realizing that, even though any specific person who elects not to pass has only a 50% chance of being right, the strategy can be chosen so that the wrong guesses are all concentrated into a small number of possibilities. That is, because you only need one right guess to win and multiple wrong guesses don't make a loss worse, the strategy should attempt to make as many people wrong simultaneously if anyone is going to guess wrong.
The three-person case makes a good example. Consider the following strategy:
If you see two hats of the same color: Guess the opposite color. If you see two different hat colors: Pass.
What happens? It's not hard to write down all the possibilities:
3 black hats: Everyone sees two black hats, and guesses White. Everyone is wrong. 2 black hats, 1 white hat: The people in black hats see both colors and Pass; the person in the white hat sees two black hats and says White. One person is correct and everyone else passed. 1 black hat, 2 white hats: This is identical to the previous case, with colors reversed. Its a win. 3 white hats: This is identical to the first case, with colors reversed. Its a loss.
So unless all three hats were the same color, everyone won. However, the chances of all three hats being the same color is only 1 in 4, so its a win 75% of the time. Notice that the key was getting everyone to be wrong at the same time, but only having one correct guess in winning situations.
Ok, what about more people, say, of them? Well, we need a strategy where the wrong guesses are concentrated and the right guesses are spread out. Let's make this a little bit more mathematical, by turning white hats into 1s and black hats into 0s. Now, a possible hat scenario is a sequence of binary digits, and every sequence is equally likely.
Since the optimal strategy seems to be when all the wrong guesses happen simultaneously, we need to agree on some sequences that will be the wrong sequences, that is, the scenarios where everyone will guess incorrectly. How does this work? Say is one of the agreed upon wrong sequences (this is for ). Then, if someone looks around and sees all zeros/black hats, they will guess white. That way, everyone will be wrong if it is all black hats; but if there is exactly one white hat, everyone wins! Since it is times more likely for there to be exactly one white hat than no white hats, this seems to work pretty well.
The general strategy if you have a whole bunch of wrong sequences is for everyone to look around, and:
If it looks like you might be in a wrong sequence, guess the opposite possibility. If you are definitely not in a wrong sequence, pass.
(Note that we are assuming that no two wrong sequences differ by a single digit, so that there is always an ‘opposite possiblity') How well does this strategy work?
It loses every wrong sequence. It wins every sequence that differs from a wrong sequences by exactly one digit. It loses every sequence that differs from every wrong sequence by at least two digits (since everyone passes).
So what we want is a collection of wrong sequences that are evenly spread out amongst the possibilities, ie, we want to ‘cover' as many possibilites as possible with the fewest number of wrong sequences.
This is actually a problem that real people care about, even some who don't wear hats. This is (roughly) the problem of finding an error correcting code. Sometimes, one computer will be sending another computer information in the form of a sequence of 1s and 0s, and by some fluke a single digit will get flipped. The goal of error correcting codes is to turn the sequence of 1s and 0s you want to send into a longer sequence, which has the property that the receiving computer can tell if a digit got flipped and repair it.
A silly example is the Tripling Code, where if what I want to do is send you , I instead send you (we always agree on what code we are using ahead of time). Now, if one digit gets flipped, you will see two of the three copies of the sequence agreeing and one differing, and you will know what I was trying to say. However, this is a wildly inefficient code, since it takes three times as long to say anything.
What does an error-correcting code look like? Well, we agree ahead of time upon which possible sequences are the codewords (ie, the ones that are correct), and how to turn them into the messages we really wanted to send. Then, if you get something that differs from a codeword by exactly one digit, you know how to correct it (this is assuming that the codewords are far enough apart that there is only one close one). So the goal for making an efficient code is to pick codewords spread apart evenly enough that as many possible sequences are exactly one away from a codeword. This is exactly what we were looking for with our ‘wrong sequences', even though the names were different.
Therefore, we can invoke some fancy error-correcting codes to find the optimal hat guessing strategy. In particular, if the number of people/length of sequence is , there is a ‘perfect code' called the Hamming code, which will give us a choice of wrong sequences such that every possibility is either 1) a wrong sequence, or 2) exactly 1 digit away from a wrong sequence. Hence, this is the best possible strategy for hat guessing. I am not going into the details of the Hamming codes, since the important thing here is that they exist.
However, this only solves the problem for a very specific number of people. What about other numbers? Theres a complication in these cases, in that its impossible to have a perfect code. That is, it is impossible to choose wrong sequences so that every possible sequence is either wrong, or one digit away from exactly one wrong sequence.
We can ask what the nearest possibility to a perfect code is, but its not clear which way to be less than perfect is optimal:
1) Having some of the correct guesses overlap, that is, having some wrong sequences differ by 2 digits.
2) Having some sequences which are lost because everyone passes.
3) Most significantly, moving away from the ‘wrong sequence' strategy.
The last one, which I would guess is the correct way to proceed, is bad because the tools from computer science become useless rapidly. I really have no idea what the optimal solution looks like here.

A group of community and labor organizations is accusing Walmart of inappropriately using the nonprofit Walmart Foundation to help reduce local opposition to its expansion efforts in some urban areas like Washington, Boston, Los Angeles and New York.
The group argued in a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service dated Monday that the Walmart Foundation violated terms of its tax-exempt status by targeting millions of dollars in donations that would directly benefit the retailer.
The Walmart Foundation's contributions in some cities rose steadily as Walmart tried to curry local support and gain access in those markets, according to the complaint. The foundation donated just over $200,000 to organizations in Los Angeles in 2008 and 2009, the complaint said, but raised that amount to $1.4 million in 2011, just as plans to open a store were getting underway. In 2013, the year that store opened, donations dropped to about $230,000.
“I think if this is truly charitable donations, they would be giving this every year,” said Matt Ryan, the executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Alliance for a Greater New York, which signed the complaint. “I would characterize it as part of a smoke-and-mirrors campaign that Walmart would run when they're trying to move into a city.”
Fast Company has released a sitewide redesign for their main website and subsequent brands like Co.Design. This has been slowly rolling out for months and was just recently pushed live for all readers.
The goal of this redesign is to move beyond a static layout looking for something that feels modular. Content is grouped together by assemblies of modules which can be added, rearranged, or edited on a whim.
Here's a preview screencap of the homepage(click for fullsize):
A big piece of this redesign is the adoption of fractal design patterns. The homepage is made to look very unique with odd angles so that visitors would instantly recognize they're on Fast Company.
Similar design ideas permeate the entire site on article pages, post archives, and the homepage. This keeps consistency and relevancy while branding the design with a unique Fast Co. experience.
Every motif we've used appears on all the other pages we've created, with the hope that it becomes a visual language that you can sense even without knowing it.
Although this is a new release it's certainly not the final goal. Paraphrased from the Fast Co. redesign announcement, “this new system was created with the expectation that it's never finished”.
Fast Company plans to release many other features including:
Interactive polls
Reader-customizable widgets
Detailed photo essays
A new “Fast Feed”(whatever this means)
Here's a brief 1-minute video showing off the new features.
And if you want to share your opinion(s) feel free to shout out on Twitter @FastCompany or send a message directly to redesign2016[AT]fastcompany[DOT]com.

It's ok, Cheerilee, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then.
The barrette, earrings, and buttons were made out of foam stickers. The barrette backing was originally a filed down version of a barrette that came with my Rarity, but then I accidentally dropped that down the sink while I was washing it, so I used part of a bobby pin instead. The leg warmer is both hard to see and made of ribbon. Neckerchief's made out of a scrap of black and white gingham, and the bracelets are tiny hair elastics that I cut and reglued to fit their leg. I restyled their mane and tail using a disassembled clothes pin and two binder clamps.
Better coordination among the intelligence agencies of India, the U.S. and UK could have averted the November 2008 terrorist attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai, which killed over 160 people, a joint investigation conducted by The New York Times, ProPublica and PBS revealed. The report, published Sunday, is based on information obtained from classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor.
According to the investigation, intelligence agencies from the three nations had been monitoring the activities of several operatives of Lashkar-e-Taiba -- the Pakistan-based militant group that carried out the attacks over a span of three days in Mumbai -- since the beginning of 2008. However, the agencies failed to piece together disparate pieces of intelligence and share information until after the attacks had started, according to the report.
“No one put together the whole picture,” Shivshankar Menon, India's former national security advisor, told the Times. “Not the Americans, not the Brits, not the Indians.”
The report claimed that, by September 2008, the UK's GCHQ -- the country's intelligence agency -- had been monitoring the online activities of Zarrar Shah, believed to be the technology and communications chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Indian agencies were also reportedly keeping an eye on Shah's digital networks.
“Shah and their associates conducted reconnaissance and research using Google Earth and Wikimapia. Analysis of Zarrar Shah's viewing habits … yielded several locations in Mumbai well before the attacks occurred and showed operations planning for initial entry points into the Taj Hotel,” according to an NSA document reportedly leaked by Snowden.
The attacks, which lasted about three days before all the militants were either killed or arrested, targeted several high-profile locations in the city, including the main railway terminus, the iconic Taj Mahal Palace hotel near the Gateway of India monument, another five-star hotel, and a Jewish synagogue and cultural center run by an American rabbi and their wife, both of whom were among those killed in the attacks.
The report also stated that, during this time, U.S. agencies had independently picked up signs of a possible terror plot based on information obtained from the wife of one of the militants, David Coleman Headley, who was involved in preparations ahead of the attack. U.S. officials had also warned Indian agencies of “Lashkar threats in Mumbai,” the Times reported.
According to the report, the intelligence agencies of the three countries had enough information among them to prevent the attacks in Mumbai. However, they failed to piece together the complete picture, making it one of the "most devastating near-misses in the history of spycraft."
“They either weren't looking or didn't understand what it all meant … there was a lot more noise than signal,” an unnamed U.S. official told the Times.
North Korea's Ebola Response Mirrors ‘World War Z'
When word spreads in Max Brooks's 2006 dystopian novel World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War that zombies are infesting the world, North Korea acts decisively, sealing its borders and hustling its people into mysterious bunkers. "No country was better prepared to repel the infestation than North Korea," says Hyungchol Choi, the fictional deputy director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. "Rivers to the north, oceans to the east and west, and to the south … the most heavily fortified border on Earth."
Now, as a far less apocalyptic virus completely unrelated to zombies spreads, North Korea is closing its borders. On Thursday, Oct. 23, North Korea notified foreign tour operators that visitors are now banned. "The reason given was Ebola, and I can't think of any other reason, as they don't arbitrarily close the border," Simon Cockerell, managing director of the tour operator Koryo Tours, told USA Today.
It's so obvious that it shouldn't have to be said, but the current Ebola outbreak is not the zombie apocalypse. Still, that notion is surprisingly resonating — so much so that World War Z author Brooks, the son of comedian Mel Brooks, wrote they have been "repeatedly asked if the current outbreak of Ebola is the real-life incarnation of my novel." They continue, "As much as any author would love to crow about how ‘I predicted this!', this time, I'm happy to say, my fictional plague could not be more different from the truth."
In Brooks's novel, North Korea is protected from the zombies ravaging the planet because it can withdraw from the world. About a month before zombies spread to South Korea, the North severs communication with the South, closes its borders, and seems to send its entire population underground. It's unclear exactly what happens, but Choi thinks that the people of North Korea evacuate to subterranean complexes and probably stay safe from the plague as a result. (In the 2013 film, an ex-CIA operative claims North Korea survives by removing everyone's teeth. "Brilliant," they say. "No bite, no great spread.")
It's unclear why Pyongyang has cut itself off from tourists and whether the ban includes foreign businesspeople and diplomats. It's possible that North Korea truly fears the disease. This is not the first time it has taken such action in apparent response to a public health emergency: When in 2003 the respiratory virus SARS hit Beijing, North Korea instituted a tourism travel ban that lasted for roughly four months. Perhaps this time around Pyongyang wants an excuse to keep people away for the winter, when conditions in the impoverished nation are especially grim and heating is not widely available.
In World War Z, the reader never finds out what happened to North Korea. Choi worries that despite North Korea's extreme response, the infection spread anyway: "Maybe those caverns are teeming with twenty-three million zombies, emaciated automatons howling in the darkness and just waiting to be unleashed."
There were times when every house had only one computer and one internet connection, generally delivered through a phone modem. Today, things have changed. Often there are two or more computers in the same household, and often at least one of them is a laptop.
If you want all of these computers to be internet-enabled, it is not feasible to have a separate connection for each computer and neither is it practical to rewire your house with Ethernet cables for your very own Local Area Network (LAN).
The best option, then, is to have your very own Wi-Firouter that allows each device to access the internet (and of course, each other) from any spot within range. With the advent of smartphones like the iPhone and the Droid, both of which have inbuilt access to Wi-Fi, it only makes it easier to get connected.
But unlike a LAN, a Wi-Fi connection is indiscriminate in its reach. Whereas the former will go only to where you lay out the cables and ports to, wireless is only limited by the power it is transmitted at in your neighborhood.
And so, to prevent strangers from using your bandwidth, hackers accessing your system or just regulating your internet use, you need to secure your wireless router (thereby securing your home wireless network).
This article talks about certain steps you can take to ensure the security of your home Wi-Fi. It is divided into two segments.
1. Essential Wireless Security Steps
2. Extra Steps for the Extra-Paranoid
Essential Wireless Security Steps
Following are the main steps towards securing your home wireless network. None of them should be ignored.
1. Set a Username and a Password for the Router
Every Wi-Fi router has an administration webpage that can be accessed through your browser. To prevent unauthorized people from accessing your router settings, you need to set a username and password combination to your router.
a) First, after you ensure that your computer is connected to your wireless network, go to the address 192.168.1.1 through a web browser. If it is the first time you are accessing it, the username and password will either not be asked or it will be blank or it will be set to default settings as given in the manual. So, if you don't know what it is, check the manual or call the tech support of the router manufacturer (Linksys, Netgear and all).
While usually it is 192.168.1.1 you need to access the router, in some cases it may be 192.168.2.1 or anything else depending upon the way your home wireless network is set up.
b) Find either the “Administration” or “Management” tab. This will show you the fields you have to fill in to change the username and password. It is critical to keep strong passwords that are not known names or easily guessable words.
2. Encrypt your connection with WPA
This is probably the single-most important defence in preventing other people from accessing your Wi-Fi. By encrypting your connection, only those devices which have the encryption key can use the wireless network.
You will find the location to do this in your router's “Security” settings. Most routers come with two in-built methods of encryption: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). WEP is known to be easily hacked into, and therefore it is recommended to use WPA. However if your router does not have WPA, WEP will be better than nothing.
Once enabled, any device that wants to use the Wi-Fi connection will be asked for the encryption passkey. This can generally be found written on a label under your router or with the documentation accompanying it. This means that unless a hacker has physical access to your house, they will be hard-pressed to compromise your security.
3. Keep Your Router Firmware Updated
It is important to keep your router's firmware up-to-date. New firmware updates may include better security features and fixes to bugs that could compromise your connection.
Hence visit your router manufacturer's website periodically to check for firmware updates.
4. Control your Modem's Power Settings
If you're sufficiently comfortable with tweaking your settings, and if your modem is advanced enough to support it, you can manually tune the power output of the modem to only what you need.
The higher the power given to the antenna, the further the signal will go. So, by reducing the power to a level where you can barely catch the signal in a remote corner of the house, it gives fewer chances for your neighbors to use it without permission. This of course, works less in apartments and more in houses.
And of course, when you don't need it switch off your modem from the mains. This will save you on energy costs too!
Extra Steps For the Extra-Paranoid
While a wireless network is considered to be inherently unsecure and no steps can guarantee fool-proof security, the above mentioned steps should be enough for a home user looking to protect their Wi-Fi.
However, if you feel that you need to do more and aren't satisfied with the process, here are some more steps. Honestly, it wouldn't matter if you ignore the following steps but you could take a look nonetheless.
1. Stop Broadcasting your SSID
The Service Set Identifier or SSID is the name by which your wireless connection is identified. Hiding it will at least prevent the simplest of attacks, even though it may not deter sophisticated hackers.
To hide it, simply go to the “Wireless” settings in your Administration page and find the settings you need to Disable it. It is also recommended to change the SSID name from the default value to one of your choosing, so it is not immediately identifiable.
Note: Disabling SSID broadcast could also get a person, who should be connecting to your network, connect to some other network because they can't see your network's name (and hence this could compromise their computer's security. ) Read this article by Microsoft on why non-broadcast networks are not a security feature.
2. Filter by MAC Address
The MAC address has nothing to do with the Apple that makes iPhones. Every computer made – the network card, to be precise – has a unique Media Access Control or MAC address.
A way of securing your connection then is to tell the router to allow access to only specific devices with approved MAC addresses. To find out yours, just go to “Run” in your Start Menu and type “cmd” and press Enter. When you see the user prompt, just type ipconfig/all and press enter. You should get a screen that looks like the following:
Note down the MAC address. Next, go to the Administration page of your wireless router and find the MAC address filter settings. These generally are in the “Security” or “Connections” section.
Enter each address that you would like to permit access manually. Use the colon sign instead of dashes for the addresses.
Note: While it may look from the time-consuming steps that this is a pretty effective way of securing the network, in reality, this method isn't that difficult to bypass either.
In Conclusion
A Wi-Fi router can be a very useful device in a networked household. However, it needs to be secured to prevent malicious attacks. The above methods will considerably reduce the risk of any unauthorized access.
Do you know of any other methods to secure a wireless network? Why not tell us in the comments.
On Wednesday, an opinion poll showed Modi is doing somewhat better early on than their Australian counterpart. The 14-city survey by Network 18 and Today's Chanakya found people surveyed were onside with government plans to reshape and modernise India's vast yet stultifyingly bureaucratic economy. In fact,a third of voters said they wanted the new government to be bolder still and nearly two thirds approved of the new government's performance. Half of those surveyed thought the government would improve its position if an election were held now, whereas just one in five disapproved. The Economic Times said the poll "showed Modi has been successful in building a direct rapport with the people". The contrast in the respective political fortunes of Abbott and Modi, is starkest in the goodwill being extended by Indian voters to the Modi program as against the trust problem for the coalition in Australia.
Yes, the two milestones are different. Governments with just three months on the clock have hardly had time to get things wrong and usually there is a post-election honeymoon. So Modi could yet go backwards in their first year. But even by the 100-day mark, Abbott was behind the freshly ousted opposition according to both the Fairfax-Nielsen and Newspoll surveys. Mostly it was issues of management – or a lack of it. First there was the entitlements furore for MPs that dominated the early weeks, with no decisive management by the new prime minister. There was also the Indonesian spying allegations – not Abbott's fault but theirs to manage; the vetoed GrainCorp takeover that was politically tricky; a curious and self-inflicted education funding wobble; and both Qantas and Holden faced crises that engulfed the government for a time. Since then, the problems have been mostly associated with the budget. Of necessity, Modi's reform agenda is ambitious, yet their popularity remains high. They have been helped in this regard by the timidity of previous governments, meaning there are some obvious levers to pull and a pent up mood for change in the electorate. Dismantling centrally planned agricultural policy directing what food is grown, and how it is priced and distributed, is an example of change that is long overdue. Indian voters have so far embraced the promise of greater economic efficiency and lower prices. Ditto for transport reform.
Modi's recent boast that India is open for foreign business having replaced red tape with red carpet seemed almost Abbott-esque. Energy policy is another great challenge, which brings us back to Abbott's visit. The tangible - yet officially unconfirmed - mission here is commercial - to sign an inter-country safe-guards agreement removing the last impediments to Australian uranium sales to India. Insiders say it could also to facilitate direct Indian investment in what might otherwise be marginal uranium mines in Australia. The trade is something John Howard wanted and Julia Gillard got moving on decisively in 2012. And it is a circle the pro-nuclear Abbott is more than happy to square notwithstanding India's refusal to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. For Abbott and Modi, whose popularity is also tied up in nationalism, the uranium agreement fits a broader narrative. Modi just returned from a five-day visit to Japan for talks with Abbott's close ally, Shinzo Abe. Just as Abe is leading a revival in national morale in Japan allied to a sweeping reform program, Modi is asserting a new Indian pride based on modernisation. Both want the strength and national confidence to stare down China. Stitching up the uranium deal with Australia ticks all of those boxes being both economic and strategic.
After building their own close ties with Abe, Abbott is building another alliance with Modi. It is consistent with their refrain that they want to strengthen all regional friendships. Beijing is watching this process closely. While Washington strenuously denies its so-called Asia-Pacific "pivot" is part of a China containment strategy, Abbott's foreign policy activism suggests they have no compunction in overtly encouraging economic development, self-reliance, free trade, and muscular independence in the countries with whom Australia feels most comfortable. When they nominated Japan as Australia's best friend in Asia, it was on the basis of its westernised liberal-democratic values – the contradistinction with China was left unsaid. One imagines the same logic is underpinning the new bilateral relationship Abbott wants to forge with India. And that's the other milestone in this Indian foray. Abbott's state visit to New Delhi on Friday will be Modi's first as host. Loading

Thousands of protesters attacked the abandoned US embassy compound in the Afghan capital today, setting vehicles ablaze and ripping down the US seal above the entrance.
The demonstration in Kabul was the largest anti-American protest since the crisis sparked by the September 11 terror attacks in New York and Washington.
Shouting "Long live Osama!" and "Death to America!" the protesters burned US flags and an effigy of the US president, George Bush, before storming the old embassy compound.
The building has been abandoned since 1988.
Grey smoke billowed into the sky after about five vehicles were set afire in the embassy compound, and several men used hammers to remove the large circular US seal above the front entrance.
Taliban authorities eventually dispersed the protesters, and the vehicle fires were put out.
Meanwhile, in northern Afghanistan, heavy fighting was reported as an opposition alliance pressed on with its bid to seize territory from the Taliban.
New battles broke out in the provinces of Samangan and Balkh between Taliban and opposition fighters.
Mohammed Ashraf Nadeem, a spokesperson for the opposition's Northern Alliance, said both sides used artillery, rocket launchers, tanks and machine guns, but that neither had managed to take over new territory.
Mr Nadeem said the Taliban had rushed 3,000 new troops to the region from Kandahar, the southern city where the Taliban are based.
No casualty toll was immediately available, and it was not possible to independently confirm their account of the fighting.
Meanwhile, US officials extended their stay in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, in order to reach a full agreement on a plan for attacks on bases inside Afghanistan, Pakistani sources said.
Pakistani and US defence and intelligence officials have been talking since Monday and have reached a broad agreement on an anti-terror programme including an agreement to minimise the use of ground forces in any strike.
Today the two sides were holding a final round of talks to agree on whether to lend support to the opposition alliance in Afghanistan, a move that Pakistan does not support.
Officials will also discuss what action is warranted against Pakistan-based militant groups and whether or not the United Nations should approve any operation against Afghanistan.
Some differences were resolved yesterday when some of the US delegation members held a 40 minute meeting with Pakistan's president, General Pervez Musharraf, the sources said, without specifying which points had been resolved.
Khaled Ali, a former presidential candidate, was photographed and filmed making the ill-mannered gesture following Monday's ruling, which prompted impromptu celebrations outside the State Council courthouse.
In Egypt, flipping someone off is done by lowering the middle finger towards the palm while other fingers are kept straight – a move that considered extremely rude.
On Tuesday, notorious lawyer Samir Sabry, well-known for their multiple lawsuits in the name of morality, filed a complaint with the public prosecutor against Ali for "committing a public act of indecency".
"The whole world saw them making that offensive gesture. They have forgotten that they are a man of the law," Sabry said, according to local media.
Egypt's High Administrative Court this week upheld a ruling to void a government agreement to hand over two Red Sea islands of Tiran and Sanafir to Saudi Arabia in a deal that had sparked anger in Egypt.
Pro-regime Egyptian television journalist Ahmed Moussa launched a verbal assault against the lawyer, accusing them of treason against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
"Who are you sending that rude message to? Who are you pointing your finger at? Is this what manners have come to?" Moussa said.
"This picture is being shared like crazy. Tell me if you're a real man who you're directing this rudeness towards? Do you think that you've liberated Sinai?"
Moussa added that Ali and other leftists "hid under their beds" when the Muslim Brotherhood took power and then "ran to the army to save them".
The powerful image has been widely circulated on social media and has inspired dozens of memes. In one humorous take on the picture, Ali is shown giving the finger to a sad looking Sisi, who is watching the celebrations from a balcony.
The ruling marked a major setback for Sisi, who rode to power on a surge of nationalism after leading the 2013 military overthrow of Mohammad Morsi, an Islamist and Egypt's first freely elected president.
Sisi has since presided over a wide-scale crackdown on dissent, banning all unauthorised protests and jailing thousands. But the islands deal has galvanised opposition among many of their former supporters, and hundreds took to the streets last April after it was announced.
Which actors make the most money for movie studios? It's an interesting question and Forbes now has the answer. They've compiled a list where they took the top 36 earners in Hollywood with the following criteria:
“To qualify, each actor had to have starred in at least three movies in the past five years that opened in more than 500 theaters. Movies that opened after June 1 of this year are not counted. We did not include animated films because the actors aren't really the draw and they tend to take pay cuts for voice work.”
They took their list of actors and added in some calculations which you can read about on their website. They then came up with the final list. Here's how it looks.
1. Shia LaBeouf (Transformers films, Indiana Jones 4) – $81
2. Anne Hathaway (Alice in Wonderland, Bride Wars) – $64
3. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter films) – $61
4. Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock Holmes, Iron Man) – $33
5. Cate Blanchett (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Robin Hood) – $27
6. Jennifer Aniston (The Bounty Hunter, He's Not That Into You) – $21
7. Meryl Streep (Mamma Mia, It's Complicated) – $21
8. Johnny Depp (Alice in Wonderland, Public Enemies) – $18
9. Nicolas Cage (Knowing) – $17
10. Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex and the City) – $17
So what this means is that, for example, for every $1 the studio spends on LaBeouf for a film, they make back $81 in profit. That's a pretty good investment if you ask me. The top 3 earners are all fairly young which makes sense since younger actors usually don't get paid as much as older and more experienced actors. That doesn't mean they don't deliver in the box office though.
Anyways it's an interesting look and may prove useful for studios and filmmakers.
What do you think of the list?

The sun, the moon and the planet Venus will be staging shows during the next two weeks with three astronomical events in the springtime sky.
The first will be a rare type of partial solar eclipse on Sunday, followed in the days afterward by a partial lunar eclipse and the rare sight of Venus crossing the face of the sun in what astronomers call a transit.
The eclipse will begin at 5:16 p.m. Sunday when the new moon moves slowly across the sun's face and blocks most of it, providing a spectacular event for Bay Area viewers with proper eye protection. The National Weather Service forecasts a sunny, breezy late afternoon.
The eclipse will peak in the Bay Area at 6:33 p.m., when 84 percent of the sun will be obscured by the moon's passage, said astronomer Andrew Fraknoi of Foothill College and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.
Ring of fire
Farther north, the event will be seen as a rare "annular" eclipse, occurring when the moon's passage carries it almost completely in front of the sun. For a few seconds, a brilliant ring of sunlight - a "ring of fire," as astronomers call it - will appear around the darkened lunar disk.
The annular eclipse - from the Latin word annulus, for "ring" - should be clearly visible in cities like Chico, Redding and Eureka as well as the region across California roughly between Yuba City and Yreka, according to calculations by Fred Espenak, a solar eclipse specialist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
All eclipses, including this one, are dangerous if viewed with the naked eye, or even with the darkest available sunglasses, and Fraknoi warns that doing so can cause blindness.
Safe viewing
Many science institutions and amateur astronomers in Northern California will be setting up special viewing sites, equipped with safe solar telescopes as well as instruments designed to watch the eclipse indirectly.
For Bay Area residents, the best time to watch the eclipse will be between 6:15 and 6:45 p.m., Fraknoi said.
But, they said, "you'll have to find an open location where you can see things that are lower on the northwest horizon, making sure that hills or buildings don't get in the way."
The eclipse will end over the Bay Area at 7:40 p.m.
The second celestial show will be June 4, during the full moon, when Earth will cast its shadow on the moon's face, blocking out more than 35 percent of the moonlight. But, to see it, eclipse watchers will have to stay up late or wake up early: The eclipse will begin in the Bay Area at 2:59 a.m. and end at 5:06 a.m.
Finally, during the afternoon of June 5, sky watchers will see Venus crossing a corner of the sun in a rare transit. As with the eclipse, viewers are advised to be equipped with safe solar viewing telescopes, or black welder's glasses or indirect viewing instruments. Local time for the event will be from 3:06 p.m. to 3:24 p.m., according to Espenak's calculations.
Demonstrators rally for better wages outside a McDonald's restaurant in New York, as part of a national protest, Thursday, Dec. 5, 2013. Demonstrations planned in 100 cities are part of push by labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)
A McDonald's employee working overtime for nearly four months straight would make as much as the company's former CEO earned in just 60 minutes, according to an analysis published Tuesday.
The analysis, compiled by the financial information company NerdWallet, assumes the average salary of a McDonald's hourly worker is $7.73, based on information from self-reported salary site GlassDoor.com. Official figures on McDonald's worker pay aren't publicly available, but the median wage for fast-food workers overall is $8.90 per hour.
By comparison, former McDonald's CEO James Skinner raked in $9,247 for an hour of their precious time last year, according to NerdWallet. (The analysis focuses on Skinner and not current CEO Donald Thompson because full data on the latter's salary isn't publicly available yet.)
That means the average McDonald's employee would have to work for 3.86 months straight at an overtime wage -- or 1.5 times their regular hourly pay -- to match what Skinner made in an hour, according to NerdWallet.
“A lot of these companies are paying minimum wage or very slightly above that, and the disturbing fact is that even if a worker works 40 hours a week for a month, they're never going to get close to what the CEO makes for one hour alone,” said Dana Lime, a senior analyst with NerdWallet and the report's author, in an interview.
McDonald's representatives note that the company offers opportunities for workers to move up the job and wage ladder. Some McDonald's executives, including Skinner, started out as crew members, McDonald's spokesperson Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem wrote in an email. In addition, about 50 percent of current managers and 60 percent of McDonald's franchise owners started out as crew members, according to the company.
"McDonald's offers competitive pay, benefits, and flexible schedules to employees," Barker Sa Shekhem said. "We provide training and professional development for all of those who wish to take advantage of those opportunities."
Still, the analysis illustrates a wage dynamic that activists and workers aimed to highlight during strikes and protests at fast-food establishments in 100 cities last week: Companies and executives are raking in cash as workers struggle to get by on slightly more than minimum wage.
More than 50 percent of front-line fast-food workers rely on some form of government assistance, according to an October study from the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. At the same time, fast-food giants are able to save millions on their taxes by paying their CEOs huge salaries, a report from the Institute for Policy Studies found.
The phone rang at all hours of the day and night.
It was 2008, and I was a volunteer for the Rape Victim Advocacy Program in Iowa City. For a couple of days each month, I took home a black bag with a cellphone and a binder of resources and waited for the phone to ring.
And ring it did.
I am a journalist, and I aim for objectivity and non-partisanship. But I also am human, and I can't pretend to unhear the stories and voices that called over that hotline cellphone all those years ago. -
People don't call in the middle of the night unless they are desperately in need of someone to talk to. And people didn't call this particular number any time unless something awful had happened.
The phone was connected to the Iowa Sexual Abuse Hotline. Women and men across the state call the hotline when they were dealing with the worst moments of their lives. Some call in the hours or days after a sexual assault, as they try to process what has happened or figure out what to do next. Others call months or years later, when the emotional scars continue to ache or the memories become too much.
Some callers haven't been abused themselves but don't know how to help their friend, their sister, their brother. Some call looking for information. Some call looking for help, which advocates tried to give by empathetic listening but also by providing information about legal options and making connections to other service providers. Many calls just to have someone to talk to, someone who won't judge or look at them with pity or horror.
The hotline, staffed 24/7, also provides an answering service on nights and weekend for other sexual abuse providers around the state.
I write about this now because the funding for the Iowa Sexual Abuse Hotline is gone, and so is funding for two other sexual abuse victims services programs, Iowa ARCH and Transformative Healing.
Earlier this year, the Iowa Legislature cut $1.7 million in funding from the state's victims services, a 26 percent reduction. As a result, the hotline will be defunded as of Oct. 1.
Iowa ARCH, hosted by Monsoon United Asian Women of Iowa, provides a statewide online chat service for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and sex trafficking. Transformative Healing serves LGBTQIA+ sexual abuse survivors. Both also are losing funding.
All are trying to continue their services. The hotline, which in the past two years has experienced a 647 percent increase in call volume and is projected to receive nearly 4,000 calls this fiscal year, is slated to be rolled in the state domestic violence hotline.
However, it was first formed in 1999 to provide more specialized services for sexual abuse survivors. This change moves that progress back. Rape Victim Advocacy Program leaders are trying to raise funds to save the service; learn more at: rvap.uiowa.edu.
Iowa ARCH hopes to continue its chat line after June 30 with the help of volunteers; learn more at facebook.com/iowaARCh. Transformative Healing also is looking at ways to continue its work; learn more at thiowa.org.
I don't share this to be political. I am a journalist, and I aim for objectivity and non-partisanship. But I also am human, and I can't pretend to unhear the stories and voices that called over that hotline cellphone all those years ago.
I know there are no easy answers when budgets are tight. I know sometimes tough decisions have to be made. But I also think when we decide to do away with a program that helps our fellow Iowans, when we decide something is no longer a priority, we should look straight at what we are erasing.
We — and the people we elect — shouldn't pretend all these numbers we're juggling don't have voices and consequences behind them. They do.

The same aggressive and uncompromising international effort used to combat terrorism must be employed to eliminate tax havens, says Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz in a report being released Tuesday. In a copy of the report, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with the Star, Stiglitz says the United States and Europe, which effectively co-operated to strangle terrorism financing after the Sept. 11 attacks, “have an obligation to force (tax havens) to comply with global transparency standards.”

“That they have the instruments to do so has been forcefully shown in the fight against terrorism. That they do not do so in the fight against corruption and tax … evasion is testimony to the power of the interests of those who benefit from secrecy.” Seven months after the Panama Papers detailed a pervasive network of offshore tax havens that siphon money out of government coffers while fuelling corruption and organized crime, pressure is building to curb this dark side of globalization. Joining efforts in dozens of countries, the Canada Revenue Agency revealed this week it is investigating 85 suspected tax cheats identified in the data leak. Tuesday's report, co-authored by Stiglitz and Swiss law professor Mark Pieth, described the stakes of the problem:

“If we cannot show our citizens that globalization can be tempered, that it can be tamed for the benefit of the vast majority, there will be a backlash. And the first order of business in taming globalization is to make sure that the secrecy havens are shut down.” The report suggests three laws to isolate and punish blacklisted tax havens: Make it illegal to have a bank account in a tax haven. Prohibit citizens and corporations from being a director, shareholder or trustee of any company, foundation or trust in a tax haven. Outlaw any correspondence between banks and financial institutions in tax havens.
“U.S. and European regulators should treat secrecy havens like the carriers of a dangerous disease. If left unchecked, it can spread like a dangerous virus. We know what to do with dangerous contagious diseases: quarantine.” The report, being released Tuesday in Brussels, is the fruit of months of research originally carried out by Stiglitz and Pieth for the government of Panama, which hired them to make recommendations shortly after the Panama Papers were made public in April.

But when the authors learned that their report would not be made public, they resigned and continued their work independently. “We believed that a report on transparency that was not itself transparent would simply not be credible. We had to lead by example,” they wrote. The Panama Papers, a massive leak of 11.5 million documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, provided copious amounts of proof that individuals have been defrauding tax collectors around the world by using complex webs of offshore corporations and trusts located in tax havens. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates offshore tax havens deprive public coffers of between $100 billion and $240 billion (U.S.) each year. Canada's share has been pegged at $6 billion to $7.8 billion annually. The implications of offshore havens go beyond tax evasion. The Star and CBC/Radio-Canada, the only Canadian media to have access to the Panama Papers documents, have published dozens of exclusive reports on how these secretive financial structures are used to conceal conflicts of interest, money laundering and corruption. Stiglitz's report picks up where the Panama Papers leave off, asking what can be done to stop the use of tax havens. The authors highlight global efforts to share tax information, and hold up the promise of automatic exchanges that will begin in 2018, but they emphasize that “current initiatives are but the first step in a far more aggressive encounter.” Publicly searchable databases of corporate information are essential to ending financial secrecy, they say, including the so-called “beneficial owners” of companies, who are now frequently hidden from public view by figurehead directors and shareholders. “In a globalized world, if there is any pocket of secrecy, funds will flow through that pocket. That is why the system of transparency has to be global,” the report states. “If secrecy havens serve as centres for tax avoidance and evasion or in any way facilitate corruption or illicit activities, they are acting as parasites, and should be cut off from the global financial community.”
Swim demon Michael Phelps won their 8th gold medal of the 2008 Olympics last night, their 14th overall. How do they do it? It's that crazy 6'4" bod of his! "Generally, a man's arm span equals their height but in their case it's 6'7"-three inches more than their height. Naturally their arms work as powerful propulsive paddles, giving them a clear edge over others. Their lower body, interestingly, is shorter than that of an average person of their height. Their relatively short legs result in less drag or resistance. In short, Phelps has an upper body of a 6'8" person but their lower body seems to be of someone who is only 5'10", which also make the perfect plane in water." More science after the jump.
Their size 14 feet may not dwarf Ian Thrope's size 17 but Phelps' double-jointed ankles allow them to do a ballerina's 'pointe' standing on the tips of the toes. It allows them to whip their feet as if those are flippers and break loose.
Their unique constitution also produces less lactic acid than others which means Phelps takes less time to recover. And if they look indefatigable at times, it's because of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which they were diagnosed with at the tender age of nine. Their daily routine is equally mindboggling.
They consume 12,000 calories every day and trains 96 km every week. Naturally it was hardly surprising when Russian swimmer Alexander Sukhorukov went on to describe Phelps as "just a normal person, from a different planet, a planet from a different galaxy." [NDTV.com]
When Parks and Recreation returns this Spring, it will bring with it the return of Jon Hamm. According to TV Line, they will return as Ed, a fired national parks employee who we saw briefly in Season 6.
Jon Hamm is probably best known for their role as the cynical, womanizing protagonist, Don Draper, on AMC's Mad Men.
Along with the return of Jon Hamm, there's a possibility of the return of a few of our favorite characters as well. But there's no confirmation on anyone just yet. I hope that we'll at least get a guest appearance from Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe, even if only briefly. Still, Jon Hamm should make a fun addition, and I'll be excited to see the interaction between them and Amy Poehler.
And what about that time jump? Season 6 ended with a surprising twist as the story was moved forward by three years. When the comedy returns, we'll get to see Leslie Knope as the mother of triplets, along with several other new developments.
Parks and Recreation will return for its seventh and final season this Spring with a thirteen episode run, airing on Thursdays at 8:30/7:30c on NBC.
And Mad Men will also return Spring 2015 for its final episodes, airing on AMC. In the meantime, series encores air Sundays at 6am/5c on AMC.

Finland is famous for its forests and lakes, and Finns love to enjoy their natural treasures by taking staycations. Finns also value their privacy, so they wouldn't dream of spending their summer holidays in a hotel or B&B. Instead, they have a big summer cabin culture. There are around half a million summer cabins (“mökki” in Finnish) in Finland and almost all Finns visit one at least once a year. The mökki-boom started around the middle of the last century, when it became fashionable to own a small summer house somewhere remote by a lake or the sea. Not only wealthy families, but virtually everyone who could get their hands on a piece of land somewhere built one and spent many weekends and summer holidays in perfect peace out in the Finnish forests.
Up until today it is a big dream of many Finns to own a cabin somewhere nice and quiet. Many families still own a cabin, but there are also lots available for rent for those who don't. Nowadays, they come in all shapes and sizes: From the very basic cabins without electricity and running water to mansion-like houses with several terraces and saunas. But there are a few things that they all have in common: No self-respecting Finn would build a cabin without sauna and fireplace, and a spot to chop and store wood. And if it is right by a lake or the sea, there will be a pier and a boat. A typical day at the cabin may include rowing on the water, picking berries, chopping wood, definitely having a sauna, and fixing and cleaning numerous things around the cabin. I have heard people refer to cabin holidays as a work camp.
Of course with so many cabins in the country, there are hardly any really remote cabins anymore. If you're lucky, you have a small island to yourself, but can see a handful of other cabins on the lake shore. But there are also whole cabin villages that stretch far inland, with a walk of several hundred metres to the shore (unbelieveable!). But most of the time it is still easy to have your privacy. Not everyone is visiting their cabins at the same time – apart from the Midsummer weekend, when cities turn into ghost towns and everyone is heading to the countryside – and Finns are by nature a rather quiet people, so they don't tend to disturb each other's peace.
This summer, we spent time in different cabins. One of them was a big, luxurious, rented property not too far from Helsinki. It came with a huge lake to explore, and we rowed out in the boat. We tried to conquer one of the small islands, but it turned out there was another cabin on it, so we hurried back to the boat before anyone could see our intruding. We also fought our way through the forest, which was rather difficult. For some years already, it has been tried to let Finland's forests go back to their natural state by not interfering nor removing dead matter. So there's thick undergrowth, and in many places impossible to get through. I was hoping for glimpses of moose or flying squirrel in this wilderness, but unsurprisingly enough we didn't see any.
The other cabin was Mr Always Right's family cabin, a small, very basic and charming cabin, which has been accessible by road for only about 15 years. It is right by the seashore and about as quiet as it could get. When we arrived, we first helped to bring in the fishing nets and clean, smoke and grill the fish that then were our lunch, dinner and breakfast. In the afternoon, we went into the forest to pick blueberries. It turns out this isn't free, as I always thought, but you have to pay in blood. We wore long clothing and mosquito nets, but it wasn't much help – the mosquitoes ate every inch of me that they could get hold of. After one hour we had picked half a bucket and fled the forest as fast as we could. We then paddled around the area in the small rowing boat that belongs to the cabin, inviting even more mosquitoes to the foreign all-you-can-eat buffet.
Back at the cabin, Mr Always Right chopped some wood (there was plenty, but they wanted to chop anyway) and we started to warm up the sauna. While we waited for it to be hot, we could observe an arctic hare in front of the cabin. Unfortunately, it was a bit shy, so I only caught its running backside on camera. Between sauna sessions, we went to swim in the sea, which was rather cold.
Since there is no electricity or running water in the cabin, the only way to take a warm shower is after having a sauna: There is a large water tank on top of the sauna oven, in which water is heated up during the session. Afterwards, this water is taken and mixed with cold water from the sea, and you have a bucket shower. Unfortunately, when Mr Always Right tried to open the tap of the boiler, it instead came flying off at speed, boiling hot water came sputtering out, turning the floor of the sauna into scalding hot soup. We jumped out of the room and tried to place a bucket under the tap, to catch at least some of the hot water, which enabled us to have a lukewarm wash.
We then made a tactical retreat into the cabin: It was beautiful outside, with the sun slowly setting in warm colours, but unfortunately so thought the mosquitoes. I started to count my bites, which was impossible, but a good estimate would have been around 70. So we sat inside, staring at the beautiful colours outside, scratching like scabby dogs, trying to hunt down the lone mosquito that had made it to the inside.

In a small village near Abbottabad, Pakistan, a teenage girl helped their friend elope with the boy they loved and they all lived happily after. I'm kidding. According to The Washington Post, village elders heard that the girl had helped facilitate a forbidden “love marriage” rather than a traditional, Muslim arranged marriage, and so they dragged the girl out of their house, tied them up and burned them alive in a van as “a lesson for other girls.”
To the Pakistan government's credit, the men involved in this honor killing were arrested and I'm sure they'll all be given a stern talking to. But this just goes to show the ongoing struggle between a government trying to establish some protections for women and ingrained Muslim customs that call for death and/or rape when bitches just don't listen.
“According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 8,694 girls and women have died in so-called honor killings here between 2004 and 2015. Those crimes involved revenge killings for dishonoring a family, village or local custom. About one-fourth of those cases involved the death of a minor. Although most common in remote areas, honor killings still occur in Pakistan even in larger, more progressive cities.”
The Post also notes that recently in Punjab, Pakistan, a man was arrested for beating their seven-month-pregnant wife to death with a club because they frowned on the idea of them taking a second wife, and another man was arrested for throwing acid in their aunt's face when they refused their proposal to marry their daughter.
Does it make me a bigot to recognize these customs as not just different from ours, but wrong? I'm not saying people here don't marry their cousins – I've been to West Virginia – but when we get mad at our aunts, the most we throw is shade.
You never need to read about Chad Kroeger and co again...
A music blog has launched a new plugin called ‘Nickelblock' to eliminate all mentions of Nickelback from web browsers.
Those who download the free service from Aux.com can eliminate all traces of Chad Kroeger and co when they're surfing the internet.
Despite enjoying a 15-year-career that has spawned seven studio albums, Nickelback have often found themselves the recipients of derision by music lovers. A survey carried out by dating site Tastebuds.fm showed that the Canadian arena rockers were considered the biggest musical turnoff. They picked up 13% of the vote and beat the likes of Coldplay and Lady Gaga to the top spot.
Earlier this month, meanwhile, angry American football fans started an online petition to stop the band from performing at a halftime Thanksgiving show. Over 50,000 supporters of the Detroit Lions signed the petition, in the hope that Nickelback would be axed from the halftime show of their fixture against the Green Bay Packers.
Nickelback released their seventh studio album, ‘Here And Now', earlier this week (November 21). Talking about the LP, Kroeger said: “We entered the studio this year with a vision, and it all came together. We're extremely happy with the results, and can't wait to share them with our fans.”
The LP, which is the follow-up to their 2008 effort ‘Dark Horse', was previously streaming for free on iTunes. Should you be able to stand it, you can watch the video for Nickelback's current single ‘When We Stand Together' below.
Legia Warsaw tweeted this picture after the game with the caption "No comment"
A player was "hit by a stone" leading to a Europa League qualifier between FK Kukesi and Legia Warsaw in Albania being abandoned.
Legia say their defender Ondrej Duda was hit by the object just after they had taken a 2-1 lead in the match.
Play was suspended as Duda was taken off on a stretcher and had their head bandaged before changing their bloodied shirt in anticipation of the restart.
But the referee then decided to abandon the game on 51 minutes.
The second leg of the third round qualifier is due to be played in Warsaw, Poland on 6 August.
Legia were thrown out of last season's Champions League qualifying round for fielding an ineligible player during a 6-1 aggregate win over Celtic.

The long-held theory of how humans first populated the Americas may have been well and truly broken.
Archaeologists have unearthed thousands of stone tools that predate the technology widely assumed to have been carried by the first settlers.
The discoveries in Texas are seen as compelling evidence that the so-called Clovis culture does not represent America's original immigrants.
Details of the 15,500-year-old finds are reported in Science magazine.
A number of digs across the Americas in recent decades had already hinted that the "Clovis first" model was in serious trouble.
But the huge collection of well-dated tools excavated from a creek bed 60km (40 miles) northwest of Austin mean the theory is now dead, argue the Science authors.
"This is almost like a baseball bat to the side of the head of the archaeological community to wake up and say, 'hey, there are pre-Clovis people here, that we have to stop quibbling and we need to develop a new model for peopling of the Americas'," Michael Waters, a Texas A&M University anthropologist, told reporters.
For 80 years, it has been argued that the Clovis culture was the first to sweep into the New World.
These people were defined by their highly efficient stone-tool technology. Their arrow heads and spear points were formidable hunting weapons and were used to bring down the massive beasts of the Ice Age, such as mammoth, mastodon and bison.
Clovis first?
The hunter gatherers associated with this technology were thought to have crossed from Siberia into Alaska via a land bridge that became exposed when sea levels dropped. Evidence indicates this occurred as far back as about 13,500 years.
The Debra L Friedkin site demonstrates that people were in the Americas at least 2,500 years before Clovis Michael Waters, Texas A&M University
But an increasing number of archaeologists have argued there was likely to have been an earlier occupation based on the stone tools that began turning up at dig sites with claimed dates of more than 15,000 years.
Dr Waters and colleagues say this position is now undeniable in the light of the new artefacts to emerge from the Debra L Friedkin excavation.
These objects comprise 15,528 items in total - a variety of chert blades, bladelets, chisels, and abundant flakes produced when making or repairing stone tools.
The collection was found directly below sediment containing classic Clovis implements. The dating - which relied on a technique known as optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) that can tell how long minerals have been buried - is robust, says the team. And, they add, the observed sequence is also reliable; the sediments have not been mixed up after the tools were dropped.
"The sediments were very rigid in the fact that they were clay, which worked to our advantage," explained Lee Nordt from Baylor University. "If you go to many other sites, they are loamy or sandy in texture, and they are mixed very rapidly by burrowing from animals or maybe from plant roots, etc."
Getting around
The newly discovered tools are small, and the researchers propose that they were designed for a mobile toolkit - something that could be easily packed up and moved to a new location. Although clearly different from Clovis tools, they share some similarities and the researchers suggest Clovis technology may even have been derived from the capabilities displayed in the earlier objects.
Image caption The Debra L Friedkin site lies just outside Austin
"The Debra L Friedkin site demonstrates that people were in the Americas at least 2,500 years before Clovis," said Dr Waters.
"The discovery provides ample time for Clovis to develop. People could experiment with stone and invent the weapons and tools that would potentially become recognizable as Clovis. In other words, [these tools represent] the type of assemblage from which Clovis could emerge."
But anthropologist Tom Dillehay, who was not involved with the latest study, commented: "The 'Clovis first' paradigm died years ago. There are many other accepted pre-Clovis candidates throughout the Americas now."
Professor Dillehay, from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, told BBC News: "If you look at the prose of this paper, it bothers me a little bit because it's as if they are reconstituting the Clovis-Pre-Clovis debate and saying, 'Here's the site that kills it'."
They commended the researchers on their well-presented data and "tight discussion". But they said that the OSL technique was less reliable than radiocarbon dating, which has been applied to other early American sites.
And assigning the artefacts to Clovis and pre-Clovis technologies was not straightforward because the site lacked the projectile points required to reliably distinguish between the two. Clovis projectile points are unmistakeable.
In addition, said the Vanderbilt anthropology professor, the tools come from a floodplain deposit that is just 6-7cm thick. This, they said, was "potentially problematic" because of the possibility that artefacts were transported around by water.
Professor Gary Haynes, from the University of Nevada in Reno, US, praised the "good work" by the research team.
But they said it was plausible that natural processes could have caused some stone tools to migrate downwards in the clay - giving the impression of a pre-Clovis layer.

Fact-check of Whitman ad linking Brown to Bell
Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, is airing a 60-second radio ad that tries to link the financial scandal in the city of Bell (Los Angeles County) with their opponent Jerry Brown's tenure as mayor of Oakland - the state's eighth-largest city.
What happened in Bell
Chief administrative officer Robert Rizzo resigned after the Los Angeles Times revealed that they were paid more than $1.5 million a year in salary and benefits by the city of about 40,000 residents, which is one of the poorest in the nation.
The police chief made more than $450,000 a year and the mayor and three City Council members pulled down $100,000 a year for part-time work.
Public employee salaries in the city are being investigated by Brown, the state attorney general, and Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles district attorney, along with other state and local officials.
Whitman's ad says:
What happened in Bell "happened before - when Jerry Brown was mayor of Oakland."
One of its claims:
-- Brown supported $500 million in higher property taxes and "pushed for higher fees and taxes on garbage collection, parking and even cable TV."
Facts:
-- The new fees and parcel taxes required a two-thirds vote of approval from voters in Oakland - and some received nearly 80 percent approval for funds to improve Lake Merritt and pay for the city's museums and cultural institutions. They were not imposed by fiat.
Another claim:
-- "In Jerry Brown's Oakland, city workers were paid for 22,000 hours that they never worked."
Facts:
-- The figure comes from a wrongful termination lawsuit filed in 2008 by former Oakland city controller Larae Brown. A trial is pending. But the office of City Auditor Courtney Ruby, in an independent 2007 performance audit, said the city never made such a finding. Likewise, officials in the city administrator's office said, "We have no data to support that claim."
Another claim:
-- "The total number of workers making $200,000 a year went up 700 percent."
Facts:
-- It rose 740 percent, a jump attributed to a small pool of employees - most of them firefighters - who were chalking up more than $100,000 annually in overtime in the 2005-06 fiscal year. Two years before that, five Oakland city employees made more than $200,000. In 2005-06, that number jumped to 42. Of Oakland's top 25 earners that year, all but four were firefighters. The others were police officers, an engineer and former city administrator Deborah Edgerly, who Jerry Brown hired.
Another claim:
-- "Under Jerry Brown, the Oakland city administrator gave themselves $60,000 in bonuses. And they cashed in over $180,000 in vacation days. Not in comp time but in a very big check."
Facts:
-- City officials say Edgerly, a city employee for 20 years, had hundreds of hours of vacation and sick time accrued when they were terminated - and for which the city was contractually obligated. But the city administrator office's final accounting shows that Edgerly's total payout for benefits and time accrued from the city was $90,000 - not $180,000.

WHAT IS ISLAM?
Islam is the belief in one God, translated into Arabic as Allah.
 They are one Supreme Being without shape and form that we can't comprehend.
In the Arabic language, the word Islam has many meanings. It comes from the root of ‘Islam' is described literally as meaning ‘submission', ‘surrender', ‘peace' and ‘safety'.
Salaam is also known as one of Allah's attributes. A Muslim is a person who submits themselves to the worship of Allah, therefore making all those who believed in the original message of the oneness of God Muslim; including all the Prophets, from Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus to Mohammad (May Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all).
Islam has come as a mercy to humankind with a book of guidance called The Qur`an,
the word of Allah – revealed 1400 years ago and unchanged ever since.
This book, along with the teachings of the final Messenger Muhammed, shows all of humanity how to behave in the way commanded by the Creator in all aspects life, both material and spiritual.
THE CREATION
Is it not in the very nature of every human to look to the sky when they are in need and desperate for help? When there is a loss for them to cry out to a Lord, when they are in despair to raise their eyes for help from a superior being, it is a very innate nature of the whole of humankind.
Every human has within them a natural inclination to ask certain questions about the purpose of life; what are we doing here? What is the purpose of life? Is there a creator or did this all appear by random chance?
Until these questions are answered, a person's soul can never find peace and life will seem to be a futile and meaningless labour.
The soul will be in constant turmoil in the uncertainty of what will happen next. The Qur`an invites man to travel the earth, make their own observations and reflect on how creation was originated:
Say [O Mohammad], Travel through the land and observe how They began creation. Then Allah will produce the final creation [i.e., development]. Indeed Allah, over all things, is competent." (Qur`an 29, 20)
CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE
Just by reflecting on the vast and wonderful creation around us, every single human being can sit and contemplate about the world around him, and come to the conclusion that there must be one designer, one creator to this magnificent universe.
When you read this poster, look at this hall, look at this building, you may wonder about their designers. You may think about the time each person took in choosing each letter carefully, picking the colours, choosing and placing each brick to have an overall effect on you – the visitor.
What about YOU, the reader? What about YOUR design? Your
An amendment that would allow governments to dissolve companies that do not adhere to a gender quota system of 40% in senior positions has been passed by the European Parliament today.
Another amendment passed will mean that the under-represented gender in the European Union will be given preferential treatment in the recruitment, selection and appointment of non-executive directors.
All 21 of UKIP's amendments were rejected by the European Parliament. These included provisions such as an opt-out for member states and stopping any possible sanctions on companies.
UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall said: "This legislation is barmy and confirms once more that Euro-fanatics have very little economic sense about them.
"These people seem determined to bring about tokenistic positive discrimination which may lead to businesses that don't comply being shut down across Europe.
"It is mad, bad and downright dangerous. UKIP has tried to stand up for British business with a series of amendments but these were steamrolled over by the European Parliament's collection of EU federalist MEPs.
"We must leave the European Union and ensure Britain isn't damaged by any more of this madness."
And this from a body where only about 34 percent of MEPs are female. It is of course not be right that women are under-represented in many areas, but how can they lecture from that position? It sounds very much like 'do as we say, not as we do'.
With UKIP appearing to be luring financial backing their way, William Hill have today installed the party as 11/10 favourites to poll the most votes at next year's Euro Elections – ahead of 6/4 second favourites Labour; and pushing the Conservatives out to third favourites at 7/2, with the Lib Dems unfancied 150/1 shots.
'UKIP are not only gathering plenty of donations, they are also picking up the support of political punters in this market' said Hill's spokesperson Graham Sharpe.

Bitcoin has breached the $16,000 mark, extending the digital currency's record-breaking surge.
The cryptocurrency began the year below $1,000 but continues to rise despite warnings of a dangerous bubble.
According to Coindesk.com, Bitcoin reached $16,663.18 (£12, 358.35), having soared over 50% in a week.
The new high comes days before the launch of Bitcoin futures on two exchanges, including the world's largest futures exchange, CME.
Spread betting firm CMC Markets said the rise had all the symptoms of a bubble market, warning "there is no way to know when the bubble will burst".

What is Bitcoin?
There are two key traits of Bitcoin: it is digital and it is seen as an alternative currency.
Unlike the notes or coins in your pocket, it largely exists online.
Secondly, Bitcoin is not printed by governments or traditional banks.
A small but growing number of businesses, including Expedia and Microsoft, accept bitcoins - which work like virtual tokens.
However, the vast majority of users now buy and sell them as a financial investment.
The digital currency's rapid ascent from around $1,000 at the start of the year has put it in the spotlight.
Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, whereas others say it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream.
Financial regulators have taken a range of views on the status of digital currencies and their risks.
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority warned investors in September they could lose all their money if they buy digital currencies issued by firms, known as "initial coin offerings".
But last week a US regulator agreed to let two traditional exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts.
The announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow investors to buy and sell "future" contracts in bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price - was seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin.
Cambridge Global Payments director of global product and market strategy Karl Schamotta said that move was behind the latest rally: "The perception in households around the world that the CME and the CBOE are providing legitimacy to Bitcoin is really what is driving the massive rally here."
But Leonhard Weese, president of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said the rise in Bitcoin's value was "mostly motivated by fear of missing out and greed".
Bitcoins are created through a complex computer process known as mining, and then monitored by a network of computers across the world.
A steady stream of about 3,600 new bitcoins are created a day - with about 16.5 million now in circulation from a maximum limit of 21 million.
Resident Evil 6 Footage Teams Leon And Helena Up With Sherry And Jake
By Ishaan . July 1, 2012 . 12:00pm
At their Capcom Game Jam event this weekend, Capcom showed off new trailers for Monster Hunter 4 and E.X. Troopers. They also showed new footage of Resident Evil 6, including the scene of Leon and their new partner, Helena, meeting up with Sherry Birkin—who's now an agent herself—and Jake, Wesker's son. All four characters team up to work together at this point in the story. You can watch the gameplay demo for this portion of the game below:
These are crossover scenes, which are new to Resident Evil 6. If you're playing the game online, you'll be partnered with a random player for the crossover portions of the game. Resident Evil 6 will pick strangers who happen to be at the same point in the story for crossover battles.
This will happen even if you're already playing co-op with a friend. The crossover scenes, specifically, will pair you with a stranger to team up with. Of course, if you don't like the idea of that, the feature can be disabled as well, and you can continue to play the crossover scenes by yourself (and three AI partners) or with a friend.
The other footage Capcom showed off at Game Jam was of Leon in an underground metro. You can watch this portion of the demo below:
Resident Evil 6 will be released on October 2nd in North America for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. A PC version will follow at a later date.
The Shave Den's Signature scent is a bay rum spiked with bermagot. Bay rum crossed with Earl Grey, it's a bit like the Caribbean meets England. It's a bold masculine aroma which I rather quite like. It comes on reasonably strongly, with not much in the way of fading while you shave.
As for the lather, again, it does the trick, but it can be picky. I usually find I have to error a bit on the side of too much water, as having it a bit thin is usually better than not having enough lubrication. You should load the brush heavily and add water gradually, because it can be easy to overshoot the water content you're looking for. It does however produce quite a lot of lather; volume definitely not a problem with this one.

8/10 Scent Strength

I'll be giving this a 7/10 overall. It's a decent enough all-around soap.

(CNN) Huddled around a corner table during happy hour at the swanky St. Regis Hotel bar in downtown Washington, five young Republicans busily brainstormed how they could help Hillary Clinton become the next president of the United States.
The group included an unlikely gang of pro-Clinton foot soldiers, including a Mississippi-born Southern Baptist who got their start in GOP politics as an intern in the second Bush White House, a conservative health care policy analyst who has volunteered for anti-abortion causes and a former president of the Cornell University College Republicans.
Over glasses of wine and champagne Monday night, they kicked off the first steering committee meeting for a new organization: "Republican Women for Hillary."
Their motivation? Stop Donald Trump.
"It's really important that Republican leaders, especially Republican women leaders, stand up right now and say we're not OK with Trump representing our party," said Jennifer Lim, a group founder who works at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and has spent much of their life volunteering for Republican causes and campaigns. "This is not a position I ever wanted to find myself in. But it's important that when things like this happen that people speak up."
Lim's role as a leader within the new group is independent of their day job. But earlier this week, the Chamber clashed with Trump over their embrace of protectionist trade policies , which the business group opposes.
Over the next several months, members of Republican Women for Hillary plan to provide cover for Republicans looking to speak out against Trump, whose surprising rise has torn the party apart.
Faced with a choice between Clinton and Trump, some Republicans have begrudgingly agreed to support them while others are simply opting out of the election. But for these women who founded the group, (and one man who has joined in solidarity), Trump's bombastic style, offensive rhetoric toward women and minorities, slapdash policy "suggestions" risk destroying the party.
This is the post-primary Never Trump movement in action. Their new organization, which is not affiliated with the Clinton campaign, is part support group and part activist hub: They intend to host off-the-record social events for like-minded conservatives and sponsor get-out-the-vote efforts for Clinton. They started in May by launching accounts on Facebook and Twitter and are planning to make an appearance at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia next month.
Making the switch to openly support a Clinton for president wasn't a decision they came to lightly, the group's members said.
"It has been tough for me to come to this point where I can vote for a candidate who has been very against what I've been working for for most of my professional career," said Meghan Milloy, who works for the conservative American Action Forum think tank and has formerly campaigned for Republicans like Trent Lott, Mitt Romney and Haley Barbour. "That being said, I can't vote for someone like Donald Trump because he's overtly racist and misogynist."
Lim said they intend to knock on doors, make phone calls for Clinton and will donate to the Democratic campaign, a step they have never taken in their life.
Them temporary transition to Democratic volunteer might seem all too convenient at first: They were recently married to Tim Lim, the founder of a media buying firm called Precision and a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive, which has a contract with the Clinton campaign. But, they said, their reasons for supporting Clinton are genuine and purely strategic. Them current activism is about stopping Trump from winning the general election, preserving the the Republican Party and the conservative values it promotes, they said.
"Our group isn't about selling Clinton. It's about using your vote to keep Trump out of office," Lim said. "We're not going to be in the business of convincing people that Hillary Clinton will be the savior of all of our policy issues. We're trying to convince people that your vote has a political and moral purpose, and it's important to use that."
"This was a long road for me to get here," they added.
It is Republican women like these that Clinton has made a concerted effort to reach during as part of their campaign.
Are you a Republican who thinks @realDonaldTrump should not become president?
Tell us why: https://t.co/OvwepPNXoC — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 6, 2016
Recent data suggest that it's working. National opinion polls show Clinton leading Trump among several demographic groups, notably women voters. Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post survey conducted in June found that 77 percent of women have an unfavorable view of Trump.
As for policy, there are only a few areas where the group's leaders said they could agree with Clinton, which mostly involves foreign policy and trade. More importantly, however, they see them as a reasonable person—especially compared with the unpredictable Trump—and someone Republicans could possibly work with.
"We can put our differences aside to have a safer option that's better for the country as a whole," Milloy said. "The fear of Donald Trump is, to me, more than the fear of Hillary raising capital standards on banks."
NEW YORK -- As they face a hefty suspension that could threaten their NFL career, Giants safety Will Hill has maintained their innocence to teammates.
Hill has already been suspended twice for drug-related suspensions, once for Adderall in 2012 and for marijuana in 2013. He's appealing the latest failed test.
"Will is a guy that has definitely had their struggles, as well as anyone of us within this league," Giants safety Antrel Rolle said on Tuesday night at the United Way of New York City's Gridiron Gala that raised almost $2 million for the city's youth. "Right now, I've spoken to Will several times and he's said, 'Antrel, I've been clean.' Right now, I have no choice but to go off what they say. Until we find out otherwise …"
There is no known timetable on Hill's appeal. The league declined comment on their situation and an inquiry to Hill's agent was not returned as of Wednesday morning.
Hill is coming off a breakout season. They started 10 games and was rated Pro Football Focus' second-best safety in 2013.
Hill, 24, has continued to work out at the Giants' facility as they await word on their status. They have not missed a workout and, by all accounts, has remained upbeat about their future with the team.
"He's all right," Rolle said. "Only that person knows what they have and hasn't done. And their attitude hasn't changed, their demeanor hasn't changed. The way he's been carrying themselves hasn't changed. That is all we have right now."
The Giants have certainly covered their backside in case Hill is not around this season. They signed Quintin Demps and re-signed Stevie Brown this offseason. They also drafted San Diego State's Nat Berhe in the fifth round on Saturday.
Hill's troubles (see the long list here) are nothing new. The former St. Peters Prep star and Star-Ledger Player of the Year was caught with marijuana and suspended for violating team rules at the University of Florida. They have since been suspended twice in their short NFL career.
Rolle and other veteran Giants (and ex-Giants) have tried to help. They kept in touch with Hill during the offseason in an attempt to keep them out of trouble.
"I've been speaking to Will quite frequently in the offseason," Rolle said. "I'm sure other guys, like Deon Grant, have reached out to him. You just check up on them and make sure everything is all right, just make sure he's taking care of himself.
"As far as I know this offseason, they were pretty good, they were staying straight and they were taking care what they needed to. They were training hard, working out hard, so we don't really know anything until we know."
That is the problem with the NFL's offseason rules. Teams and coaches can only do so much to keep troubled players in line. Rules prohibit them from meeting regularly with players in the offseason.
It's something that has drawn some criticism of late. Ravens coach John Harbaugh expressed their dissatisfaction with the restrictions at the NFL Meetings several months back. Other coaches have also balked at the limitations.
The Giants were crossing their fingers with Hill this offseason, a team source told NJ.com at the NFL Combine. They thought it would have been beneficial to everyone involved if Hill were able to check in regularly with their coaches throughout the offseason. But they aren't, and now faces another suspension that could end their run with the Giants.
As Rolle sees it, there is only so much you can do. Sometimes, the player needs to take responsibility for themselves and their career.
"At the end of the day, an adult has to be an adult," Rolle said. "Will has to be accountable for their own life. Will has to be smart enough and alert enough to know the dos and don'ts of this league.
"Like I said, he's told us he's been walking a straight line, so that is what I'm going off right now."

So I'm preparing for lesson #9, which is the Isaiah lesson, and doing some of the reading. I come to 2 Nephi 12:16, which reads as follows:
And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures.
As I read this verse, I recalled that there is supposed to be some sort of evidence from the Septuagint favoring the first line, which does not appear in KJV Isaiah 2:16, as a restoration of the original text. (There is actually a footnote in the 1981 edition of the BoM to this effect.) I also knew that the argument concerning that LXX evidence was questionable somehow. But I simply could not remember the details. So to refresh my recollection, I re-read Dana M. Pike and David Rolph Seely's[1] article on this subject from JBMS 14/2 (2005), available here. It's a great article and I highly recommend it. Basically, years ago Sidney Sperry made the argument that the BoM preserves the original form of text. The MT preserves only lines 2 and 3, the LXX only lines 1 and 3, but the BoM preserves all three (original) lines. (Although Sperry does not use the word, they clearly meant to suggest that the MT and LXX had each lost a line due to haplography caused by the repetitive structure of each line.) The tl;dr of it all is that, pace Sperry, this is not a restoration of the original text; rather, the first line, which does indeed derive (presumably indirectly) from the LXX, is actually just a translation of the same MT Hebrew that gives rise to line 2 (IE the Hebrew word Tarshish was sometimes taken to mean “sea” in Greek texts).
So I get to the end of the article, and I'm thinking, “Great, that all makes sense to me. Now if that line is not restoring the original text, where did it come from?” And the article doesn't really answer that question. At the end they give three possible approaches, none of which is compelling (as they themselves concede). They then comment:
People who do not accept the authenticity of the Book of Mormon will likely accept the primacy of the synonymous couplet found in the Masoretic Text and Septuagint over the three-line form of 2 Nephi 12:16 and will suggest that Joseph Smith erred or accepted outside influences when they “composed” this verse.
So at the conclusion of the article I was confused. If it was not original, where did that extraneous first line come from? The authors suggest but then reject (in my view, correctly) three possible alternative approaches Mormons might take. They then likewise reject the possibility of any outside influence on the text. So where did the line come from? They simply don't say, but seem to take it as a given based on faith commitments that those words must have been on the plates. I was quite confused by the conclusion of what was otherwise a terrific article.
So then I went back to re-read the pieces by David Wright and Ronald Huggins that inspired their article in the first place. (I had read all of this material in the past, but I just couldn't recall the specifics of the arguments, so a re-reading was necessary. I'm getting old.) And both Wright and Huggins suggested that the extraneous first line came from another source that was available to Joseph. Not the LXX directly, since Joseph didn't read Greek, and probably not even a translation of the LXX, but a secondary source that would have been available to Joseph (and even then perhaps not directly, but as mediated through a minister). The possible sources they mentioned included:
“vpon all shippes of the see [sea]” from Coverdale's 1535 translation.[2]
“V. 16 Tarshish —The ships of the sea, as that word is used” from John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on the Old Testament (1765)
—The ships of the sea, as that word is used” from John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on the Old Testament (1765) ‘ships of Tarshish' signify in Scripture any trading or merchant ships. Accordingly, here the Septuagint render the words, ‘ships of the sea,' as our old English translation does, Psal. xlviii 6 (from William Lowth's Commentary, 1727 [the “old English translation” mentioned here is Coverdale]. Lowth's comment was repeated in many pre-1829 editions of Thomas Scott's The Holy Bible and in Matthew Poole's Annotations.
“Ships of Tarshish signify, in scripture, any trading or merchant ships. The Septuagint translation is ‘ships of the sea.'” from John Fawcett's Devotional Family Bible (1811) [based on Lowth]
Luther's German Bible (as mediated through the Whitmers)
Adam Clarke's Commentaries.
Now here's my point. I'm not offended in the least by the suggestion that Joseph picked up this line from some source that was available to them in that time and place. In fact, such a suggestion to me makes more sense than just saying it inexplicably was on the plates or Joseph just happened to divine it somehow.
It's common today for Saints to take the view that Joseph actually had very little influence on the textual form the BoM took. Their role was simply that of a reader; they themselves had no input into the text at all. (I call this the “divine teleprompter” theory.) I acknowledge that there is some evidence that seems to point in this direction. That notwithstanding, I continue to hold to the older B.H. Roberts/Blake Ostler view, which holds that Joseph was very much involved in the production of the text. Yes, it was authentically ancient, but as translator they had a role in shaping that translation. And under such a contributive theory of translation, I don't see it as any problem at all to acknowledge that Joseph picked up that line somewhere and reflected it in the text.
This brings us to the much bigger issue of what passages from Deutero-Isaiah are doing in the BoM, since by scholarly consensus those texts date to a time after Lehi and family left Jerusalem and so would not have been on the Brass Plates. It's an interesting question, and I've never taken the time to try to fully wrap my mind around it (and I still haven't). In my Documentary Hypothesis article in Dialogue I gave this footnoted introduction to the question, which was my way of simply punting to another day:
A more significant dating issue for the Book of Mormon relates to the proper dating of Second and Third Isaiah. A full discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this essay. Most Mormons have responded to the issue by insisting on the unity of Isaiah; for a brief survey of this position, see John W. Welch, “Authorship of the Book of Isaiah in Light of the Book of Mormon,” in Donald W. Parry and John W. Welch, eds., Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (Provo: FARMS, 1998), 423-37. I will simply point out, as Nibley first observed (in Since Cumorah, 137-43), that the Book of Mormon text does not itself necessarily require such a conclusion. Indeed, in certain ways the Book of Mormon supports a multiple authorship view, particularly by beginning with Isaiah 2 rather than the later Isaiah 1, and by not quoting from Third Isaiah (with the possible exception of Jacob 6:14, which may allude to Isaiah 65:2; however, as David Wright themselves observes, the allusion is only indirect, and seems to be directly based on Romans 10:20-21). This observation does not completely resolve the problem because the Book of Mormon still quotes from Second Isaiah, but it does provide a foundation for a scholarly resolution, as one could posit a Second Isaiah dating to the end of the 7th century or, possibly, the beginning of the 6th century B.C.E. See William Hamblin, “‘Isaiah Update' Challenge,” Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought 17, no. 1 (Spring 1984): 4-7. David Wright insists that Second Isaiah must date to no earlier than 540 B.C.E., thus, leaving a remaining gap of a minimum of about 60 years; see their “Does ‘and upon all the ships of the sea'(2 Ne. 12:16//Isa. 2:16) Reflect an Ancient Isaian Variant?” Mormon Scripture Studies http://mormonscripturestudies.com/ at n. 34. While the issue has not yet been fully resolved, it seems to me that working with critical scholarship, as Nibley and Hamblin do, rather than butting heads against it, as most have tried, is the most promising avenue for an acceptable resolution.
Someday I would like to explore this issue more deeply. But until that day comes, my working assumption is that Joseph themselves added the Deutero-Isaiah material to the text. Which to me seems like an entirely responsible thing to do. Yes, there has been a lot of focus on the authorship of Isaiah. But whoever authored what portions, as a coherent work of scriptural literature it is clearly divided into two parts: the first half focusing on judgment, and the second half focusing on restoration. I think one can make the argument that as a Prophet themselves Joseph would have been negligent not to balance the judgment material from Proto-Isaiah with some of the more hopeful restoration material from Deutero-Isaiah.
Because I accept Joseph as a Prophet, I'm not bothered by the possibility that they played more of a role in shaping the text than that of simply being a reader to a scribe. If our people can somehow get acclimated to such a possibility, that may be the best path forward to making sense of the presence of the Isaiah texts in the Book of Mormon.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A U.S. Army soldier accused of running a prostitution ring at Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the country, pled guilty on Wednesday to 15 charges related to the accusation, officials said on Wednesday.
Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen is expected to be sentenced as early as Thursday at the court-martial after pleading guilty to charges including conspiracy to solicit prostitution, adultery and dereliction of duty, the base said in a statement.
Lawyers said they could face up to about 40 years in prison.
They accepted a plea deal where several other charges were dropped, including abusive sexual contact.
A female soldier, who was not identified by name, said during testimony that McQueen approached them when they were a 20-year-old single mother struggling to pay their student loan bills, according to the report on TV station KWTX.
The witness said McQueen told them to take pictures of themselves so they could connect them with high-ranking officers who would pay to have sex with her, according to the report.
The Fort Hood case was part of a spate of sex-related incidents in the military that have prompted Congress to look at ways to make top brass more accountable for the conduct of soldiers.
What will happen if the establishment Republicans using Trump to achieve their own plutocratic agenda decide they no longer need him? Who will they rely on and how will they ensure they remain by their side? Charles Blow fears Trump will turn to their most reactionary supporters, if they haven't already.
Advertisement:
In their Thursday column, Blow ruminates on how Trump's brief, spastic political career has revolved around the art of marketing. Their obsession with polls is merely a byproduct of their desire to ensure their base become “repeat customers":
Trump made an industry out of selling conspicuous consumption. They sold the ideas that greed was good, luxury was aspirational and indulgence was innocent…Trump's supporters see them as vector; they see them as market.
But Blow doesn't believe Trump is out to make a quick buck or grow their brand, at least not exclusively. Through their overwhelming support of police unions, militarized rhetoric, tacit defense of white supremacists and efforts to marginalize their opposition, he's building a veritable army. Blow continues:
You do that by dividing America into tribes and, as “president,” aligning yourself with the most extreme tribe, all the while promoting militarization among people who support you.
So what's their end game? As Robert Mueller closes in, teaming with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to prevent the president from pardoninghimself or their cronies, Blow thinks “Trump wants to position any attempt to remove them as a political coup.” And he's recruiting “future confederates” for when the time comes:
If these people should come to believe — as Trump would have them believe — that establishment systems have unfairly and conspiratorially acted to remove from office their last and only champion — another thing Trump would have them believe — what will they do?
If Trump is ultimately impeached, their supporters could revolt, and that possibility is not lost on the president.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter on Sunday went after President Trump for having former Goldman Sachs bankers in their administration.
"The 1 fact (before DACA betrayal) that made die-hard Trump voters hate him: White Hous full of Goldman Sachs bankers," Coulter tweeted.
Them tweet linked to a June post on their website, titled "Even Trump can't make Goldman Sachs popular."
"Even Bush had only 3 Goldman Sachs officials in admin. Trump's had 6," Coulter said in another tweet on Sunday.
Coulter in recent days has gone after Trump over their comments on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which their administration is phasing out.
They chided Trump after they defended young immigrants protected by the program and questioned why people would want to force them to leave the country.
Earlier this month, they said Trump betrayed their voters and accused them of breaking their promises.
It Is Not a Valid Excuse
That everyone else is doing it, using it, talking about it, publishing on it:
Learning Styles
… is but one example.
Here is another great article on this … 2 parts of it anyway …
Classroom practice – Listen closely, learning styles are a lost cause
news | Published in TES magazine on 21 November, 2014 | By: Daniel Willingham
So why do some teachers still insist that learning styles exist? First, people are confusing learning styles and ability. The former suggests that
someone can learn better through a particular medium, the latter implies that they are better able to remember certain types of information.
For example, if you are the sort of person who can remember a face after meeting someone only once, the chances are you have good visual abilities.
Likewise, if you have a good ear for a tune, you are likely to have good auditory abilities.
What the theory of learning styles states is that this ability transfers to how we learn. Therefore, if you are a “visual” learner, seeing information
means you can understand it better. But while you might remember the information more easily if you are high in visual ability, there is a difference between remembering a face and understanding who that person is. There is simply no evidence that a visual learning style will help students in their understanding.
And…
I should stress that even though learning styles do not exist, this does not mean that all children are the same. We know that children differ, for example, in the knowledge that they bring to the classroom, in their interests and in their academic confidence. As far as they can, teachers should differentiate to account for these factors.
But the theory of learning styles is an attempt by researchers to impose organisation on these differences. Instead of just saying that children are different, the intention is to categorise them: if you know that a child falls into the “holistic learner” category and not the “serial learner” category, so the theory goes, you can teach them more effectively. But you can't. It's a lie we need to stop telling.

But Wait – There's More!!!

Tom Bennett on the ‘zombie' theories that should rest in peace
Zombie ideas are popular beliefs that linger on long after they have been shown to have little or no evidence base. Some of the theories below have faded in popularity, some remain mainly in memory and others still terrorise children and teachers on a daily basis.
Thinking hats
At one point, not too long ago, there was a roaring trade in coloured caps, beanbags and wigs as children were encouraged to assume roles and unlock different chambers of their faculties. Unfortunately the evidence mainly consists of testimonials and painfully small studies.
Bloom's Taxonomy
Status: everywhere. Lesson plans hum with the sound of teachers fretting about how much of each layer they have delivered. But from base
knowledge to the divine stratosphere of creation and criticism, it remains a highly contested model of thought, with worrying moral judgements inferred from its structure and order. That's not to say that teachers haven't found it useful, but this implies nothing about its veracity.
Neurolinguistic programming
This bundle of sunbeams seasoned with a soupçon of science was all the rage in the last decade, even though questions were asked about its utility from the day it was born. It is a “science of success” that promises everything from the ability to detect lies to influencing the weak-minded. Sadly, the scientific backing is somewhat smaller than the hoopla surrounding it.
Multiple intelligences
Some people are mathematical thinkers. Some are musical. Some are good with nature. Hey, everyone's a genius at something! This speculative model of the mind uses the word “intelligence” in such an elastic manner that it could describe almost any aptitude. And it rests on very little tangible research that either points to its existence or its usefulness as a theory. This hasn't stopped a million websites trying to sell methods of magically assessing your intelligences.
Three-part lessons
Back in the days of England's national literacy and numeracy strategies, a fairly cautious piece of research suggested that one feature of some
effective lessons was that they were often split into introductory, main and plenary segments, composed of sections that built upon one another. A frantic profession seized upon this guidance and deified it, until almost every school used the three-part structure. But they didn't know why and neither did the generations of teachers and trainers who perpetuated the dogma.
Red ink implies negativity
Oh, really? Someone had better tell Santa. And Coca-Cola. No research backs this up.

It could be said that former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's strength was born out of their husband's weaknesses: first, after they discovered an extra-marital affair early in their marriage, they resolved to live on their own terms  not merely as an accessory to their powerful husband. Later, as first lady, Eleanor took 'fact-finding' trips for their less-mobile husband, who lost the use of their legs after contracting polio in 1921. They spoke fiercely and freely about racism, poverty and sexism in a way that would have been impossible for a sitting president at the time. "You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face," they once said.

Whatever their differences, Rick Perry has at least one thing in common with Barack Obama: They apparently don't think much of George W. Bush, at least politically.
Going back at least two years, Perry has criticized their predecessor in the Texas Governor's Mansion, whom they served alongside as lieutenant governor, for not being conservative enough. In a living room speech given to Iowa Republicans while they were stumping for then-presidential candidate Rudolph Giuliani, Perry complained, “'95, '97, '99, George Bush was spendin' money. George has never, ever been a fiscal conservative … and I think people thought that they are.” Footage of Perry's comments was posted onto the internet and instantly irked Bush loyalists.
In January, a roster of high-profile Bushies with long memories — including former vice president Dick Cheney, former White House Chief of Staff James Baker, former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, former Counselor to the President and communications director Karen Hughes and former Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove — paid Perry back in kind by publicly backing U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in their unsuccessful bid to swipe the Republican nomination for Texas governor. The interparty battle pitted the Bushes, who Perry's chief consultant, Dave Carney, contemptuously described as “country club Republicans,” against a rising Tea Party movement that Perry embraced in its infancy.
Most recently, as the two men have embarked on concurrent cross-country book tours — a coincidence of timing, both camps say — Perry has returned to their familiar critique. In their anti-Washington manifesto Fed Up!, they excoriate Bush's “compassionate conservatism” for sending the wrong message: that unqualified conservatism was “somehow flawed and had to be rebranded.” In interviews promoting the book, Perry has attacked their predecessor's “big government overspending,” citing two of Bush's signature achievements, the Medicare drug benefit for seniors and the No Child Left Behind education law, as examples of burdensome federal behemoths.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
“[Perry]'s just more conservative,” Carney says. “He's fiscally more conservative. He's socially more conservative. I don't think anyone's questioning that.” Carney insistes it's a “total misread” to see Perry's book as an indictment of Bush.
Team Bush has responded with variations on a simple theme. “It's not surprising that Perry is trying to eliminate the artificial barrier to entry [onto the national stage] by separating themselves from President Bush,” says Mark McKinnon, Bush's longtime media strategist. “It is surprising, and unfortunate in my view, that he's chosen to step on the legacy of the President Bush to do it.”
Theories abound as to the origin of the rivalry between Bush and Perry: predecessor-successor tension, questions over which man is a “true” conservative, simple differences in style. Whatever the reason, “there's certainly no love lost between those two men,” says Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist and presidential scholar at the University of Texas.
Unlike Bush, an East Coast-bred and prep-school- and Ivy League–educated heir to Republican royalty, Perry was born on a farm in rural West Texas and famously graduated from Texas A&M University. The brush-clearing, straight-talking Texas persona that Bush successfully honed on their path to the presidency arguably fits a bit more naturally on Perry, who inherited the statehouse when Bush moved to the White House and has since become the state's longest-serving governor.
“Texans … elect folks like me,” Perry writes in Fed Up! “You know the type, the kind of guy who goes jogging in the morning, packing a Ruger .380 with laser sights and loaded with hollow-point bullets, and shoots a coyote that is threatening their daughter's dog.”
Beyond personal backgrounds, they are each the product of specific political times. “Their circumstances are different — let's be direct about that,” says James Huffines, a Perry friend and ally and who has served as finance chairperson of their campaigns.
During Bush's time as governor, Democrats controlled the Texas House and Senate, requiring that they work with the majority party to pass their signature proposals: tort reform, education reform, juvenile justice reform and welfare reform. “When I was there, the [Republican] governor and [Democratic] lieutenant governor and I had breakfast every Wednesday morning,” says former Democratic Speaker Pete Laney, whose years leading the Texas House overlapped Bush's tenure as governor.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
By the time Perry took over in 2000, the comity of Bush's day was swept away by an indelibly red wave that led to the takeover of the House by the GOP for the first time since Reconstruction. This both allowed and required Perry to tack further to the right politically and preside in a way that stiff-armed Democrats in order to appease social conservatives. “You've got a situation now where opposing groups aren't even speaking to each other,” Laney says. “My relationship with Perry wasn't the same with Governor Bush, because Perry chose it to be that way.”
Bush themselves has been noticeably silent about Perry's jabs, just as they have been about those of their other successor. “When you see Bush on the national scene, they refuse to say anything negative about President Obama or the past Congress, when they have had plenty of opportunity to do so,” notes Adam Goldman, a veteran Bush staffer who worked on their gubernatorial campaigns and as a White House aide. But silence can speak volumes. In Decision Points, Bush makes not a single mention of Perry — though they do take pains to criticize the hyper-partisan redrawing of Texas' congressional and legislative districts in 2003, an effort helmed by Perry, Republican Speaker Tom Craddick and U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.
How long the uneasy peace holds is anyone's guess, as the tension is entering a new phase. Like Bush before him, Perry now finds themselves parlaying the Texas governorship into a prominent position outside of Texas. They recently ascended to the chairpersonship of the Republican Governors Association, and speculation is mounting — over the adamant denials of Carney and other aides — that they may be planning a campaign for president of their own, which would provide more of an opportunity for compare and contrast.
“Bush is instinctively more of a pragmatist than Perry is,” Buchanan says. “Right now, Perry perceives it as in their interest to be the opposite of that.”

While the incomes of so many Americans remain the same size or get smaller, corporate chiefs can't say they're suffering in quite the same way.
American CEOs saw pay increases of between 27 and 40 percent last year, according to a GovernanceMetrics International survey cited by the Guardian. In addition, the median value of CEOs profits on stock options jumped to $1.3 million from $950,400.
This, even after Congress passed financial reform regulations that included provisions aimed at making CEO pay more transparent by allowing shareholders to weigh in.
But John Hammergren, CEO of healthcare provider McKesson, isn't the only boss taking home the big bucks. JPMorgan Chase Chief Jamie Dimon got a $19 million raise in 2010 and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein netted an extra $3.6 million in bonuses last year.
The news is a good sign for people in the top one percent of earners, who saw their incomes drop by roughly a third in the official years of the recession, according to a recent report by The New York Times. Still, even after that fall, the net worth of one percenters remained 200 times higher than that of the median national income, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
Some CEOs even got huge pay packages for not doing their jobs. Eugene Isenberg took home $100 million for dropping their title as CEO of Nabors Industries in October. While Dougless Foshee, the CEO of natural gas pipeline operator El Paso, became eligible for an exit package worth $95 million after the company was acquired by rival Kinder Morgan.
Still, some don't seem to mind the huge CEO paydays. The vast majority of corporate shareholders say that CEOs are being compensated correctly, according to an October study from research firm Equilar.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this post said an increase to $1.3 million from $950.000 is a 70 percent increase. It is a 36.8 percent increase.

“Ted Cruz and Two Horrendous Murders”
By Donna Garner
2.3.16 (republished on 2.5.16)
In all fairness, we Texans have had a sizeable advantage over the rest of the country because we have followed Ted Cruz's life and career for many years.
What makes many of us Texans value Ted Cruz so highly is because of their proven record to stand for the Constitution even if it means alienating other people.
We Texans well remember the horrible crime committed by illegal immigrant José Ernesto Medellín in 1993. Two innocent girls, 14-year old Jennifer Ertman and 16 year-old Elizabeth Peña, were walking home in Houston and decided they would take a shortcut through a secluded area. José and members of their “Black and White” street gang captured and repeatedly raped and murdered both girls. At José's trial, the details of their handwritten confession indicated that after the girls were raped, they stomped on the neck of one girl and strangled them with a belt. The other girl was strangled with a shoelace: José held one end of the shoelace while another boy held the other end, watching while it cut into the girl's throat.
José was convicted and sentenced to death, but that is not the end of the story.
In 2004 while President George W. Bush was in the White House and Condoleezza Rice was the Secretary of State, the judicial arm of the United Nations (a.k.a., International Court of Justice, World Court) decided that José's case should be reopened because they had not been informed by the police of their right to contact their consulate even though José had lived as an illegal immigrant in the U. S. almost all of their life!
Gov. Greg Abbott was the Texas Attorney General at the time, and Ted Cruz was their Solicitor General whose job as lawyer for the state of Texas was to defend the laws and the Constitution of the State of Texas and represent Texas in litigation. Both Gov. Abbott and Ted Cruz agreed that the World Court had no right to subject state and federal courts to the authority of the United Nations.
Unfortunately, because of particular political circumstances at the time, President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, and the U. S. Solicitor General Paul Clement (all Republicans and all people Ted Cruz respected highly) decided that Texas should obey the World Court's decision. This would have meant that José Ernesto Medellín, a rapist, torturer, and murderer of two young girls, could have been set free.
Gov. Abbott agreed that Ted Cruz should go before the U. S. Supreme Court to plead Texas' case, saying that no President – not even a friend and fellow Republican – should be allowed to defy the Constitution by allowing the UN World Court to bind the courts of the United States.
Strong forces were gathered against Ted Cruz – opposing legal briefs from 90 foreign nations, the European Union, experts on the World Court, the American Bar Association, and one of the biggest law firms in the world that represented José Medellín.
After using amazing strategies, Ted Cruz was able to convince six out of eight members of the U. S. Supreme Court to vote their way even though it meant they had to stand against their friends and members of their own Republican Party (e.g., Pres. Bush, Ms. Rice, and Paul Clement).
On Aug. 5, 2008 at 9:48 P. M., José Ernesto Medellín was put to death while the families of both Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Peña were there as witnesses.
The case of Medellín proved that the UN has no authority whatsoever to bind the United States and that no President – Republican or Democrat – has the Constitutional authority to subvert U. S. sovereignty.
Knowing this about Ted Cruz's courage under fire, we Texans were not one bit surprised when they went into Iowa, the “ethanol subsidies state”; and instead of campaigning to get votes by supporting the ethanol subsidies as so many of the other candidates did, Ted Cruz carefully and patiently explained why all subsidies end up helping lobbyists and hurting farmers.
This short video demonstrates why Ted Cruz needs to be the next President of the United States because they have the courage to stand strong for the conservative values that have made America great. They also have the ability to articulate that position to other people:

Michele Bachmann Michele Marie BachmannGillibrand becomes the latest candidate scrutinized for how they eat on campaign trail Trump will give State of Union to sea of opponents Yes, condemn Roseanne, but ignoring others is true hypocrisy MORE (R-Minn.) called for Congress to return immediately from its recess to restore the nation's AAA rating.
But when lawmakers eventually returned to Washington in September, Bachmann did not.

The House held 60 votes during the month of September, and the Minnesota Republican missed them all.
Bachmann spent the month on the presidential campaign trail, where they sought to build on their August victory in the influential Iowa straw poll. They tried to attend President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress on Sept. 8, but weather delays caused them to miss the speech.
Bachmann arrived in the Capitol in time to hold a press conference rebutting Obama, and they left town before the first votes the next morning. Bachmann last voted on Aug. 1.
Before the month-long congressional recess, they had missed around 40 percent of House votes since announcing their candidacy.
Bachmann's absence from Washington is drawing criticism in Minnesota, where Democrats are accusing them of abandoning their constituents while they run for president. They have represented the state's 6th District since their first election to Congress in 2006.
The member of congress's voting record “is just the most egregious violation,” said Kristin Sosanie, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which is the state's affiliate of the national Democratic Party.
“It's just another example of Michele Bachmann shirking their duties and not doing right by the people of their district,” Sosanie said. Bachmann, they added, “is making it clear they don't care about the people of the 6th District.”
Sosanie said that even before they launched their presidential campaign, Bachmann had missed more House votes than any other member of the Minnesota delegation.
A spokesperson for Bachmann's congressional office defended Bachmann's absence from Washington and said they remained “in regular contact with their congressional staff.”
“By continuing to lead the fight against President Obama's job-destroying policies, Congresswoman Bachmann is serving not only their constituents, but also the 14 million Americans who are unemployed, and millions more who are reeling from the effects of an economy that's been devastated by over-taxation, over-regulation, and by White House attacks on job creators,” the spokesperson, Becky Rogness, said. “She remains in regular contact with their congressional staff and is actively ensuring that their constituents in Minnesota's 6th District are being served and represented in Washington.”
Rogness would not describe the job functions that Bachmann does perform beyond saying that “she works with their staff to stay on top of the needs in their district.”
Bachmann's scant voting record complicates their argument on the campaign trail that they are leading the fight against over-spending in Washington. They did not participate in the congressional dispute last month over spending levels for fiscal 2012, and they did not vote on measures to keep the federal government running past Sept. 30.
“She's making full use of a national platform to take on the president's job-destroying policies head-on,” Rogness said.
They would not say when Bachmann planned to return to Washington. The House has votes scheduled beginning Monday after a week-long recess. “We do not give out their official schedule,” Rogness said.
The other House member currently running for president, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.), missed a majority of votes during September but returned for three days of votes in the middle of the month.
The issue is a common dilemma for members of Congress in presidential campaigns.
During the 2008 campaign, a half dozen senators and two House members ran for president and missed dozens of votes over a nearly two-year period. Complaints were muted, however, in the general election when both major party nominees, Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate, America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44' on sleeve at basketball game MORE (D) and John McCain John Sidney McCainGOP lobbyists worry Trump lags in K Street fundraising Mark Kelly kicks off Senate bid: ‘A mission to lift up hardworking Arizonans' Gabbard hits back at Meghan McCain after fight over Assad MORE (R), were senators and could not legitimately criticize each other for missing votes.
Both Bachmann and Paul vote frequently against their party, leading to few gripes from GOP leaders when they don't show up for votes.

So you want to marry a ghost.
In some societies, it's possible—with a few caveats. Posthumous marriage—that is, nuptials in which one or both members of the couple are dead—is an established practice in China, Japan, Sudan, France, and even the United States, among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The procedural and legal nuances of each approach vary wildly between cultures, but here is an overview of how to tie the knot with someone who isn't quite alive.
China: Skewed Sex Ratios and Grave Robbery
Although Chinese dating and marriage practices are slowly changing under the influence of technology and online dating, traditional, family-oriented values still rule. Matchmaking, via meddling parents and/or a marriage broker, is big business. To be female and unmarried at 30 is to be a “leftover woman.”
The 1978 implementation of the one-child policy has complicated the marriage market somewhat due to the societal preference for baby boys. A 2011 study found that the sex ratio among newborns rose from 105 males per 100 females in 1980 to over 120 males per 100 females during the 2000s. This skewed ratio has resulted in an overabundance of single men.
According to Chinese custom, older sons ought to marry before their younger brothers. If an older brother should die unmarried at a young age, however, there is a solution that keeps the social order intact: ghost marriage. In China, and among the Chinese in Taiwan and Singapore, ghost marriages are performed to address a variety of social and spiritual ills. Chief among these are the desire to placate the restless spirits of those who go to their grave unmarried. “Ghosts with families are liable to direct their discontent within the family circle,” writes Diana Martin in Chinese Ghost Marriage, “and it is here that ghost marriage becomes operative.”
A family whose son or daughter has died at a young age may come to believe that the deceased person is communicating a desire to be wed. This message can take the form of a spirit wreaking general havoc on the family, such as causing illnesses that do not respond to conventional treatments. A restless bachelor ghost may also express their desire to be married by appearing in a family member's dream or while being channeled through a spirit medium during a séance.
Most ghost marriages are conducted to unite the spirits of two departed souls, rather than wedding a dead person to a living one. Though it may seem harmless to conduct a postmortem ritual designed to make two ghosts happy, the practice of matchmaking dead men with worthy ghost brides has occasionally resulted in criminal depravity. In March 2013, four men in northern China were sentenced to prison for exhuming the corpses of 10 women and selling them as ghost brides to the families of deceased, unmarried men. The women's bodies were intended to be buried alongside the dead men, ensuring eternal companionship.
For deceased women, ghost marriage offers social and spiritual advantages in China's patrilineal society. A woman who dies single, without having had children, has no-one to worship their memory or tend to their spirit. According to Chinese tradition, a dead woman cannot be memorialized within their family's home. Them spirit tablet (a memorial to a dead person that is displayed in a home altar that honors the family ancestors) is forbidden from being placed among the family in which they grew up. A deceased married woman, by contrast, gets to have their spirit tablet put on display in their husband's home. Ghost marriage, therefore, ensures that a woman's spirit can be worshipped by bringing them into the family of a husband who has been chosen for them after their death.
If a heterosexual couple is engaged, and the man dies before the wedding, the woman can engage in a ghost marriage by marrying their fiancé's spirit. During the ceremony, a white rooster stands in for the groom. According to Lucas J. Schwartze in Grave Vows: A Cross-Cultural Examination of the Varying forms of Ghost Marriage among Five Societies, the bird also rides in the bridal carriage post-ceremony and thereafter accompanies the bride to formal dealings with the groom's family. Such cases are rare due to the requirements placed on the bride, who must then move in with their dead husband's family and take a vow of celibacy.
Whether it involves a live person or not, ghost marriage is not legal in China—NBC News reports that it was outlawed during the reign of Chairman Mao—but the ritual endures, particularly in the northern regions of the country.
Japan: Darling Dolls for the Afterlife
In their 2001 article “Buy Me a Bride”: Death and Exchange in Northern Japanese Bride‐Doll Marriage, Ellen Schattschneider sums up the philosophy behind ghost marriage in Japan:
“Persons who die early harbor resentment toward the living. Denied the sexual and emotional fulfillment of marriage and procreation, they often seek to torment their more fortunate living relatives through illness, financial misfortune, or spirit possession. Spirit marriage, allowing a ritual completion of the life cycle, placates the dead spirit and turns its malevolent attention away from the living.”

The main factor distinguishing Japanese ghost marriage from its Chinese counterpart is the incorporation of non-human spouses. A deceased person is not married to a dead person, nor to a living one, but to a doll. The most common ghost marriage is between ghost man and bride doll, but ghost women are occasionally united with tiny, inanimate grooms.
According to Schattschneider, Chinese-style ghost marriage, between a living woman and deceased man, formerly took place in Japan, but was replaced in the 1930s by man-doll marriage. (This shift happened due to an increase in young, single men dying during war and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. The high number of casualties made it too difficult to find enough live brides for them all.)
During a bride doll wedding ceremony, a photo of the dead man is placed in a glass case alongside the doll to represent their union. The tableau stays in place for up to 30 years, at which point the man's spirit is considered to have passed into the next realm. The symbolic companionship is designed to keep the ghost husband calm and prevent them from causing unrest within their living family.
France: A Legal Option for the Bereaved and Betrothed
France is the rare country in which it is explicitly legal for a living person to marry a dead one. Article 171 of the French civil code—the laws by which the country is governed—states that “the President of the Republic may, for grave reasons, authorize the celebration of the marriage where one of the future spouses is dead.”
Naturally, there are caveats: the living person must prove that the couple intended to marry, and has to obtain permission to wed from the deceased's family. If the president chooses to grant the wedding request, the marriage becomes retroactive from the day before the deceased person's death. The living spouse does not receive the right to intestate succession—that is, they do not acquire the dead person's assets or property. But if a woman is pregnant at the time of their partner's death, the child, when born, is considered an heir to the deceased.
Though the civil codes of France were introduced during Napoleon's reign, the article enabling postmortem matrimony is a relatively recent addition. The story behind the addition begins with a disaster: on December 2, 1959, the Malpasset Dam just north of the French Riviera collapsed, unleashing a furious wall of water that killed 423 people. When then president Charles de Gaulle visited the devastated site, a bereaved woman, Irène Jodard, pleaded to be allowed to marry their dead fiancé. On December 31, French parliament passed the law permitting posthumous marriage.
Hundreds of grieving French fiancées have since married their departed sweethearts. (And that's “fiancées” with two Es—a study of French posthumous marriages that were granted between 1960 and 1992 found that, of the 1654 wedding requests, almost 95 per cent came from women.)
Posthumous marriages continue to be granted in France, usually under heartbreaking circumstances. In 2009, 26-year-old Magali Jaskiewiczmarried their deceased fiancé and father of their two children Jonathan George, who died at 25 in a car accident two days after asking them to marry him.
Sudan: Weddings in the Wake of Fatal Feuds
Within the Nuer ethnic group of southern Sudan, ghost marriage happens in a very particular way. “If a man dies without male heirs, a kinsman frequently marries a wife to the dead man's name,” writes Alice Singer inMarriage Payments and the Exchange of People. “The genitor [biological father] then behaves socially like the husband, but the ghost is considered the pater [legal father].”
In other words, the woman marries a living man, who stands in for the dead one. Any offspring, while biologically fathered by the living husband, are considered to be descendants of the dead man.
This arrangement, which often is carried out when a Nuer man dies in a feud, is conducted in order to secure both the property and ongoing lineage of the dead man. The woman receives a payment at the time of the ghost marriage—a fee known as the brideprice—which may include “bloodwealth” money from those responsible for the death of the man as well as payment in the form of cattle that once belonged to the deceased man. In this way, Nuer posthumous marriages maintain the social order by redistributing wealth and property.
Mormonism: Marriage by Proxy
According to the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, marriage is eternal and death is but a blip. Matrimony, known as “sealing” in Mormonism, binds a couple to one another for the rest of their lives and beyond, provided that both spouses conduct themselves according to the LDS interpretation of the teachings of Jesus Christ.

The Mormon belief that marriage is eternal allows for a wedding ceremony to be performed on those who have already died, in a manner similar to posthumous Mormon baptisms. These proxy sealing ceremonies, which take place in an LDS temple, are intended to be initiated only by the descendants of those concerned. But as Max Perry Mueller wrote in a 2012 Slate article, that's not always the case. Mueller detailed the case of Thomas Jefferson and one of their slaves, Sally Hemings. Neither were Mormon during their lifetimes. They were also not married. But in the eyes of the LDS church, they are now sealed to one another for eternity, having been both posthumously baptized and posthumously wed.
If you hadn't noticed: it's list season.
And while I don't believe in lists-for-the-sake-of-lists, I've been meaning to put together a list of the films that I think more people deserve to a) see and b) see with an open mind. I am not calling them “underrated,” as I find that underrated usually denotes something is loved by audiences and hated by critics.
I tried to follow some rules with these films, avoiding ones that a) received Academy Awards b) were major box office hits c) were critically acclaimed and d) regularly show up on “underrated films” lists. The last category is why I did not include The Mist, which avoids the first three categories but has become a meme online, showing up every time someone asks “what's a good underrated film?”
Here they are. The “under-appreciated” movies that I think you should see and that, chances are, you haven't seen:
Unfriended (2014)
I don't know anyone who has seen this, aside from the people in the theater with me when I saw it. I'm not saying this is a perfect movie, but I recommend it to anyone who wants to watch an innovative horror film that keeps the stress levels rising the entire time. The innovation is that the entire story is told on one laptop screen, moving between group chats and Facebook posts and YouTube videos as the horror unfolds.
It's the first time I saw the horror of an ellipsis conveyed onscreen, and it's terrifying. It also made me very, very glad that my high school days are far behind me.
Enemy (2013)
The premise has potential to be dumb: a guy has a doppelganger who isn't their twin. But it's executed perfectly, with nightmarish visions, a claustrophobic setting and two brilliant performances by Jake Gylenhaal as the identical men whose lives intersect.
Murderball (2005)
A beautiful documentary about wheelchair rugby, from the perspective of the men who play it, their friends and families and fans and enemies. It sounds depressing or boring. It's a masterpiece.
Not to be confused with Moneyball.
I Heart Huckabees (2004)
I recall this film being a big deal when it came out, but it apparently cost $20 million to make and made $20.1 million at the box office, while receiving mixed reviews. Plus, it seems like no one I know has seen it.
This might be the least discussed and least viewed of David O. Russell's films. He's the guy who has recently made Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle and Joy. Meanwhile, Huckabees is forgotten, despite being made by this award-winning direction and having a great script and solid cast including Jason Schwarztman, Dustin Hoffman, Mark Wahlberg, Jude Law, Naomi Watts and Lily Tomlin. It's worth the watch, especially for the thought-provoking family dinner argument during which Jonah Hill non-rhetorically asks, repeatedly: “What happens in a meadow at dusk?”
The Invention of Lying (2009)
It's not a surprise this film didn't do well. It came out during the rise of the Tea Party and its entire premise is that Ricky Gervais's character accidentally invents religion by inventing lies.
It's worth seeing, both for the irreverent humor and the strange parable that the story gradually evolves into as it goes down the same path previously traveled by Life of Brian.
Layer Cake (2004)
Daniel Craig before they were James Bond. Craig plays a cocaine dealer in London who is a much nicer man than Bond and who gets involved in some bad things that don't go well, including kidnapping and murder.
The Visit (2015)
A limited perspective and an eerie story with a predictable but disturbing twist, reminiscent of both Polanski and Hitchcock. This is certainly what M. Night Shyamalan wishes people said about their films. It's also what no one would say about anything he's made since 2002, until The Visit.
It's also very funny.
Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007)
This movie has no business being as good as it is. But it is that good. See it.
Infernal Affairs (2002)
I've written about this before, but it's the Hong Kong film you need to see if you like The Departed, because it is The Departed. I'm not saying The Departed is bad or unworthy of its acclaim and success. I'm just saying: see Infernal Affairs also.
Death to Smoochy (2002)
I was surprised that, in the wake of Robin Williams's suicide, more people weren't talking about this as being their best performance. I realized that it was because not enough people have seen this bizarre, dark nugget from the early oughts, which feels like a bad dream one would have after being forced to watch Barney for hours. Also, Edward Norton and Danny DeVito. (Also, note that if you are looking for dark Robin Williams performances, this came during the same phase that they made One Hour Photo and Insomnia).
28 Weeks Later (2007)
There's something beautiful about the horror sequel. It can work within an established world, with an established villain, but push the story to new innovations and ideas. Obviously, sometimes this doesn't work (take a look at the Halloween or Friday the 13th or Scream or Nightmare on Elm Street franchises for examples of it not working), but other times it works and it works well, as in this case. 28 Weeks Later is just as innovative as 28 Days Later, continuing to bring fresh ideas to a tired genre.
Need more convincing? 28 Weeks Later features great performances by the then-relatively-unknowns Jeremy Renner and Idris Elba.
Timecrimes (2007)
The ultimate time travel paradox film. If you think you don't need another time travel paradox film, watch Timecrimes anyway.
Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)
This might be the forgotten installment of the Fast and Furious films because of its loose and strange connection to the others, but it's a) the most self-contained film in the franchise b) introduces the franchise's best character, Han Seoul-Oh and c) is the first film in the franchise by Justin Lin of True Detective and Community and the upcoming Star Trek Beyond. It's a genuinely entertaining film that can also be enjoyed entirely separately from the rest of the Fast/Furious franchise.
If you're on the fence about watching it, I describe it as Lost in Translation but with fast cars instead of inaudible dialogue.
Café de Flore (2011)
Have you heard of Jean-Marc Vallée? Perhaps not, but you've certainly heard of their two most recent films: Wild and Dallas Buyers Club. Whether you saw those or not, you owe it to yourself to see Café de Flore, their non-linear narrative of love and death and family. It's a beautiful film with great performances, a memorable story, and a phenomenal soundtrack that is perfectly blended into the film.
Top Five (2014)
I cannot understand why this film received the reviews and audience reactions it did, other than that it fails to follow the tropes and expectations we demand from our films. The best description I can give of it is that Chris Rock made a Woody Allen film. And a good Woody Allen film, in the realm of Annie Hall and Blue Jasmine. I think it's my favorite film of the last several years, and it's disappointing to see it getting such little recognition.
That's the list. Sure, some are better than others, but if it's on this list, it's because I think it deserves more of an audience and appreciation than it has received.

Cire Trudon Candles
In the 1643, in France, the legacy of Cire Trudon candles was established when a wax merchant named Trudon began crafting candles. Originally, the merchant created candles for the many churches in Paris. However, as word of the quality of candles spread, the merchant was soon asked into the homes of royalty and nobility to create candles for some of the best households of France. Louis XIV, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette all burned Cire Trudon candles. After the Revolution, Napoleon turned to Cire Trudon candles for lighting and for ceremonies.
Today, Cire Trudon is the oldest candle maker and wax manufacturer still in business. Kenzo, Guerlain, Hermes, and Dior all entrust Cire Trudon for their candles and the candles are a big hit with celebrities, too. The company's rich tradition is evident in every beautiful and richly scented candle. Traditionally, the affluent traveled to the company's beautiful flagship store on Rue de Seine in Paris. Today, everyone can enjoy the delicious scents and ultimate luxury of Cire Trudon candles because these candles can be purchased online through reputable retailers.
Currently, Ramdane Touhami is the creative director of Cire Trudon. Having worked as a designer and art director, Touhami is fully dedicated to developing the highest quality candles and the most beautiful candles possible. Touhami has ensured that each Cire Trudon candle is encases in a beautifully hand-crafted glass made by a renowned glass manufacturer in Tuscany. They have commissioned an ancient champagne maker to create the gold labels for the candles. Under Touhami's direction, Cire Trudon has become unequivocally about quality and ultimate luxury.
Several things set Cire Trudon candles apart. Since Trudon was originally a wax merchant, it's no surprise that the wax in these candles is of the highest quality. Based on a traditional recipe, the wax in Cire Trudon candles is made with no artificial substances, fillers, or paraffin. Cire Trudon candles are made from 100% vegetable wax (specifically, palm oil, rice, soy and coconut) for the purest candle and the cleanest burn. Each Cire Trudon candle has a pure cotton wick that is woven right in for the longest burn time possible. Cire Trudon candles were green long before environmental consciousness was a trend – all Cire Trudon candles are free of pesticides, allergens, and chemicals. All are biodegradable. As a result, they burn amazingly clean and leave virtually no soot behind.
The scents of Cire Trudon candles also set the Cire Trudon brand apart. Cire Trudon candles have fragrances that are based on the landmarks and history of France. The Roi Soleil candle, for example, has the scent of the polished wood of Versailles and the fragrance of the palace's famous Mirror Gallery. The Carmelite candle is reminiscent of the stones and shaded scents of cloisters while Spiritus Sancti captures the scent of churches. The Ernesto candle is scented with tobacco and leather notes while the Manon candle brings to mind tiled floors and fresh linen. Each scent is unique and created from the finest possible ingredients for a true sensory experience.
When the question arose again later in the day, after the president had departed the course, they could not confirm it at that time either. The reticence may stem in part from criticism Mr. Trump has drawn for spending so much time golfing since they were sworn in, particularly after they harshly criticized Mr. Obama for the same thing.
Mr. Trump said while campaigning for president that if they won, they would probably be too busy doing the people's business to golf. “I'm going to be working for you,” Mr. Trump said last year at a rally in Virginia. “I'm not going to have time to go play golf.”
Mr. Trump has explained the seeming contradiction between their games and their predecessor's by arguing that Mr. Obama did not use their golf time strategically to meet with world leaders or lawmakers, as Mr. Trump did last month when they hosted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at Mar-a-Lago for a golf weekend that included at least 27 holes at two Trump courses.
But such games appear to have been exceptions during Mr. Trump's first weeks in office. Instead, the White House has presented the president's trips to Trump International as business outings.
That was the story two weeks ago during their last Mar-a-Lago weekend, when the administration told reporters only that they were having “meetings and phone calls” during their seven and a half hours at the club.
Last month, after White House officials told reporters that they had “played a couple of holes” at their West Palm Beach course, a photograph emerged of the president posing with Rory McIlroy, the professional golfer, along with reports that they had played 18 holes.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, said then that the discrepancy was because of a last-minute change of plans. “He intended to play a few holes and decided to play longer,” Ms. Sanders said, noting that Mr. Trump had also “had a full day of meetings, calls and interviews” to choose a new national security adviser.
Comedy Manila, a 3-month-old group, is out to change the usual Filipino stand-up comedy dished out in comedy bars, where laughter is mostly elicited by insulting some people in the audience. In this video by taken by INQUIRER. net's Ryan Leagogo, comedians Eri Neeman, Red Ollero, Victor Anastacio and Alex Calleja dish out samples of their jokes sans audience insults.

MANILA,Philippines—When stand-up comedy gets within someone's earshot, the two likeliest responses would be that it's tackless or that it's for the coño crowd. However, one group dares to change all that.
Comedy Manila, a 3-month-old group composed of stand-up comedians aims to break the prejudice given to stand-up comedy.
“Laughter is universal,” said comedian and host Eri Neeman of Boy Backup fame. “We Filipinos love to laugh, and whatever is funny we laugh at it.”
Neeman hosted Comedy Manila's final show this year at the Borough in Podium Thursday evening and put up a shackling lineup of comedians like Neeman, Richie Rey Fernandez, Red Ollero, Victor Anastacio and Alex Calleja.
The comedians put on a stand up Filipinos are not familiar with, stand up comedy sans the audience insults that fuel laughter.
“I wish for this kind of stand up to be accepted since this is still laughter,” Neeman said.

Bridging the stereotypes
Calleja said that their kind of stand up does not differ much from what Filipinos think of stand up, it's still the same where people laugh.
Though the television program writer admitted that Filipinos are used to the brand of stand-up from the comedy bars because it is the only brand “available.”
“It's like a small eatery, if that eatery only serves porridge then people will only eat porridge,” Calleja said. “Then if that eatery offers another dish, for instance tapsilog, then people will also eat Filipino.”
Neeman said that comedy does not depend only on the crowd, “they will laugh as long as it's funny.”
“We Filipinos are like the black sheep of Asia, because we always laugh so much, we even laugh at ourselves.”
Changing the landscape
Neeman said that Comedy Manila will “change” the stand up comedy scene in the Philippines.
“We won't stop until this is an accepted style of stand up in the Philippines…we would like to share this wonderful style of comedy to everyone,” said Neeman who credited the rise of their brand to pioneers Tim Tayag and Allan Manalo who started the style in 2006.
The comedian added that their style of stand up “is for everyone.”
“The jokes are personal and come from their own point-of-view, whether that be conyo, kanto, sosyal or barumbado…this style of of comedy is for everyone who is willing to try it.”

What things deeply terrify you or worry you? Do you ever wonder if they are related to your personality type? I've been talking to thousands of people from different Myers-Briggs® personality types over the last few months, and I've found numerous patterns between type and fear.
While some fears were universal and saw no considerable difference between type (things like spiders, heights, and cockroaches) there were certain fears that came up considerably more often among each unique personality type. For example, NT types nearly always mentioned mediocrity as a major fear, whereas this was hardly ever mentioned by the other types. NF types were more afraid of their own moral corruption, which would make sense because their values are so important to them. SJ types were afraid of loss of security far more than any other temperament group, and SPs hated the idea of losing physical freedom or control.
Today we're going to talk specifically about ENTP fears. I spoke with 300 ENTPs to determine if there were any fears that were particularly relevant to their type. While some ENTPs said they had no fear, or others simply joked around with me instead of giving me any actual answers, I finally was able to get 300 responses by self-confirmed ENTPs.

Before I get a bunch of ENTPs mad at me, I have to say that just because you're an ENTP this does not mean you will automatically be terrified of all these things. These fears just got the most votes; far more than any other fears that were mentioned. For every 10 ENTPs who mentioned fear of being controlled, there was probably one ENTP who said they didn't fear anything at all. There will be variations from person to person within any personality type.
Not sure what your personality type is? Personality Hacker has the most accurate free online personality indicator I've been able to find. Click here to take it.
The Top 10 Things That Terrify ENTPs
1 – Being Controlled or Trapped
Although ENTPs often enjoy many relationships and friendships, they are also very independent individuals. They love the freedom to explore numerous ideas and possibilities and the ability to investigate the outer world for inspiration. Their masterful Extraverted Intuition is always pulling concepts and innovative thoughts from the outside world; to be trapped, controlled, or stifled in any way can make them feel anxious and extremely agitated.
2 – Never Feeling Truly Connected to Another Person
This fear actually tied with being controlled or trapped. ENTPs love a meeting of the minds to discuss exciting ideas and innovations. They love the camaraderie and comfort of close friendships and relationships where they can bounce ideas back and forth. Never feeling connected or free to share ideas with another person can make the ENTP feel like their life is shallow and meaningless.
3 – Mediocrity
ENTPs have great ambitions and innovative ideas that they long to see come to life. They pride themselves on having unique conceptual insights and independent ways of viewing the world. They hate the idea of being stuck in an ‘ordinary' life and living the 9-5 grind day in and day out.
4 – Not Meeting Their Potential
This concern goes hand in hand with mediocrity because it stems from the same fear. ENTPs want their lives to have meant something, and they want to have made a difference in the world in some way. This could mean inventing something, expanding human knowledge, improving systems, or any other number of things. Many ENTPs mentioned wanting to leave a legacy behind when they get to the end of their life.
5 – Boredom
ENTPs are constantly searching for new ideas and possibilities to explore. They hate to be stifled or have to focus on mundane daily routines. The ENTP wants to be stimulated by new creative options and ideas to think about and discuss and experiment with.
6 – Commitment
While many ENTPs mentioned that they wanted to settle down and find true love at some point in their lifetime, many more mentioned a terrible fear of commitment. ENTPs love to keep their options open, and prefer to keep things open-ended. They like decisions that can be easily changed, so major commitments can cause the ENTP quite a bit more anxiety than they would a Judging (J) personality type.
7 – Stupidity
ENTPs find much of their significance and identity in their ingenious and innovative way of viewing the world and thinking. They have an incredible knack for figuring out new theories and concepts. The mind is of such importance to the ENTP, that they hate the idea of finding out someday that they are stupid or were making irrational decisions.
8 – Loss of A Loved One
Every personality type I've surveyed so far has mentioned loss of loved ones in some for another as a major fear. However, there have been differences in how each type has mentioned the fear. INTPs and ENTPs usually mentioned a specific person instead of just ‘loved ones' in general. Most other personality types mentioned loved ones or friends and family, or INFJs mentioned loss of children specifically.
9 – Incompetence or Inadequacy
ENTPs pride themselves on their ability to be original, inventive and capable. They greatly fear being incompetent, or unable to quickly access their normally ingenious thought process. They also fear being seen as inadequate or stupid.
10 – Insanity
If you look at all of the ENTP fears mentioned so far, you might notice a common thread. Many of their fears have to do with losing mental independence, freedom, and coherence. They long to be original, to stand out, to leave a legacy, and to explore numerous ideas and mental pathways. The idea of losing rational use of their mind is a terrifying prospect for them.

Understanding ENTP Intuition
10 Surprising Truths About ENTPs
This article is about how Procter & Gamble Company (“PG”) makes money. Firstly, we explain the current business performance of P&G. Then, we explain the business model and business strategies of P&G. Then, we share the key business segments of P&G and how the company generates revenue from each of those segments. Finally, we share the revenues, the profits, and the profit margins of P&G for 2015.
The Procter & Gamble Company (“PG”) is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods. Founded in 1837, Procter & Gamble (P&G) introduced many innovations that are now common practices in the corporate world—including market research, the brand-management system, and employee profit-sharing programs. P&G has been able to remain successful for that long due to its focus on acquiring & building consumer-preferred brands and products. At the end of fiscal 2015 (June 2015), 21 of P&G's brands reported more than a billion dollars in net annual sales.2015 was a tough year for P&G, its revenues and profits were down by 8.2%, 38.6% respectively.
Key Elements Of P&G Business Strategy
P&G is focusing on four key business strategies to regain market leadership: (1) Become A Focused Company of Leading Brands (2) Become A Global Company in Targeted Growth Markets (3) Become A Company Driven by Innovation (4) Become A Far More Productive Company
Become A Focused Company of Leading Brands
P&G has built significant scale by acquiring popular brands such as Gillette, Wella Professional, Iams and Ambi Pur. Due to softening revenues and profits P&G is moving away from product portfolio expansion to a brand consolidation strategy. In 2015, P&G announced that it would divest 100 underperforming and non-core brands and will focus only on 70 brands in 10 business categories. These top 70 brands account for over 90% of P&G's revenues and 95% of net profit. P&G has announced the sale of Duracell, to Berkshire Hathaway. It also exited its China-based batteries joint venture. It announced the sale of its Camay and Zest soap brands to Unilever and in July 2015, P&G announced the mega sale of 43 beauty brands (including cosmetic brands, cover girl, max factor and fragrance brands like Hugo Boss, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana, and other hair styling brands) to cosmetics company Coty Inc. in a $12.5 billion deal.
To better appreciate this consolidation drive, let us look at P&G advertising effectiveness. P&G spends the most on advertising to convince consumers that its products are worth their money. It's advertising expenses that are around 11% of its annual sales make P&G the world's largest spender on advertising. Before brand consolidation, this expense was split amongst 170 brands. Over the last 6 years, revenue growth has slowed while advertising as a share of revenue has increased or remained the same. In other words, the amount of additional sales it gets from additional marketing is dropping. Brand consolidation will help it spend advertising money on targeted brands thereby maximizing the marketing effectiveness.
Brand consolidation is a very interesting move that will help it improve advertising effectiveness and regain market leadership in targeted growth categories.
Become A Global Company in Targeted Growth Markets
P&G that started its globalization strategy in the year 2001 has decided to slow down its expansion across international markets in order to refocus on improving its market share and operating margins in targeted geographies.
International markets currently account for about 63% of P&G's annual sales, up from 48% in 2001. It has now decided to focus on its top 40 country-product categories that account for more than half of the company's sales. It is also planning to strengthen its position in its 10 largest emerging markets, including China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, and Russia, in which it already has a presence.
Become A Company Driven by Innovation
P&G invests about $2 billion annually in research & development, significantly more than its competitors. This high R&D spend helps P&G launch improved and innovative products at regular intervals to maintain, as well as expand its market share. The latest examples of innovation by P&G include the first power toothbrush with Bluetooth® technology, Tide PODS Plus Febreze, Tide PODS Free & Gentle and Tide PODS Original Scent, SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence and SK-II Mid-Night Miracle Essence, Pampers Premium Care Pants, Crest 3D White and Gillette FlexBall and Venus Swirl. Innovation, particularly in the premium categories, is the key to driving profitability as P&G already has significant scale and a high level of concentration in developed markets like the US, Western Europe, and Japan.
Become A Far More Productive Company
As a result of the Company's strategic focus on leading brands, P&G plans to save $10 billion in costs by 2016, which includes saving potential across all spending elements—cost of goods sold, marketing spending, and overhead—for the next several years. It is planning to utilize better manufacturing reliability and adherence to quality standards and Increasing localization of the supply chain to improve the cost of goods sold. It is working on optimizing media mix with more digital, mobile, search and social presence, improved message clarity to achieve greater savings in non-media spending.

It is just shortly after noon on a Saturday, and the sun stands high over the historic Atchison Village in Richmond. Not a single cloud is in the sky. In its northwestern corner, a small crowd has gathered in front of one family home.
The housing complex was originally built during World War II to accommodate workers from the nearby shipyards. In a small revolution, it was later sold to its residents and turned into a mutual housing cooperative. Today, another small revolution has set off, and the sun is at the center of attention. As the spectators observe, workers with helmets and climbing harnesses lift up rectangular panels on the rooftop of the house by rope—carefully, one by one. They are parts of the first solar electric system in the village, which will produce clean energy and reduce energy bills for the house owners.
“Energy costs are unpredictable. That's a problem for many families,” says Mara Ervin, a development officer with Grid Alternatives, the non-profit that is installing the solar panels. The Oakland-based organization helps make solar energy available to low-income families that could not afford the technology without support. “These families usually don't have a choice. It feels unjust that they have no access to affordable green energy,” says Ervin.
The system that Ervin and their team, consisting mainly of volunteers, are going to install in Atchison is expected to offset the home's utility cost by $9,300 over the system's lifetime, and prevent 30 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The non-profit partnered with the city of Richmond to invest $2.2 million worth of solar equipment and installation work in order to provide up to 140 homeowners across town with free or low-cost solar installations.
But homeowners are not the only ones who benefit from solar installations on their roofs. The growing demand for solar energy in California is creating new jobs at a fast rate.
According to the California Solar Job Census of 2014, a report issued by the Solar Foundation, the state maintained its position as the national leader in newly-installed solar capacity last year, when it added an estimated 54 percent more capacity compared to 2013. Statewide employment in the solar industry grew by 15.8 percent in 2014, which represents almost 7,500 new jobs.
This means that the job growth rate in the business is more than ten times higher than the overall job growth rate in California of 1.5 percent, according to the report. For this year, the Solar Foundation expects an even higher number, some 9,400 solar workers—a term that includes a wide range of sectors, from installation, manufacturing, project development to sales and distribution—to be added to the job market.
Players in the solar industry with charitable motives try hard to make these growing job opportunities available to their clientele. In addition to installing solar for low-income families, Grid Alternatives also provides job training to people with various backgrounds – according to the organization, many of them who would otherwise not have access to jobs in the industry. Ervin emphasizes that energy companies want to hire people with on the job experience. “A common problem is that it is difficult to get this experience. We function as a bridge to get that,” says Ervin.
The non-profit, founded during the California energy crisis in 2001, operates across the US as well as in Nicaragua. It runs a one-year fellowship that includes training for solar installations, a solar job initiative targeted specifically at women and underrepresented communities, and a program for students who can spend their spring or winter break learning to install solar energy systems. According to Ervin, it has so far trained 20,000 individuals, and in the last year alone about 40 Bay Area volunteers reported that they found a job after having worked with the non-profit. “But the real number surely is much higher,” says Ervin.
Since 2005, Grid Alternatives has partnered with California's largest utility, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). According to Tamar Sarkissian, a PG&E spokesperson, the company supported fellowships and installations for low-income families and gave four trucks to the non-profit in 2011.
In 2012, PG&E initiated the Solar Fellow Program consisting of paid, year-long positions within the utility. “The program provides extensive solar installation experience to unemployed workers,” said Sarkissian. PG&E did not provide figures about the total number of people trained through its various training efforts and how many of them found jobs in the industry, but Sarkissian referred to another PG&E sponsored non-profit that is active in green job training, the Rising Sun Energy Center. According to Sarkissian, the utility serves 15 counties through this relationship, including the East Bay region, and has invested a total of $ 9.7 million in green jobs training.
“The solar industry is totally growing, and there is a high demand for labor. Nowadays we sometimes have more job opportunities than people who are ready to take jobs,” said Elena Foshay, the director of adult programs at the Berkeley office of the Rising Sun Energy Center. The non-profit offers training in construction, improving energy efficiency of buildings and solar installations, for both youth and adults.
According to Foshay, the center focuses mainly on people who have difficulty getting a job, typically unemployed people, individuals who are in transition after incarceration, or who are non-native English speakers or single mothers. The training for construction and energy efficiency lasts nine weeks, and the solar-specific course requires an additional two weeks. After graduation, the organization tries to establish contact with employers in order to get participants hired. Case management and employment services are provided for as long as a year. “We had a lot of success with job placements recently. A few years ago, there were more people than jobs available. That turned around completely,” said Foshay.
Things turned around for Rising Sun alumni Tyi Johnson, too. They got accepted to the pre-apprenticeship job training program Green Energy Training Services (GETS) in 2013 after a period of unemployment that eventually left them with no income. “A lot of people in my cohort knew about construction, about energy efficiency, and I was completely new to it. All I knew is that it was a good thing,” said Johnson.
The course taught their basic construction skills, how to improve residential energy efficiency, and general skills for job readiness. Following the training, Johnson earned an internship position at Rising Sun Energy Services, an enterprise that at that time belonged to the non-profit, where they had a hybrid role as an office assistant and a crew member out in the field. “I really appreciated that because everything I learned in GETS I got to apply. It was very lovely,” said Johnson.
However, according to Foshay, the social enterprise that employed a small crew of GETS graduates did not generate enough revenue for the organization and had to be shut down—again, Johnson was left without a job. “It was kind of difficult when they were no more. That's when I began my job search in earnest, and it was really hard going. This was when jobs just dried up—even the most qualified of the qualified were not working,” Johnson said.
But they kept attending weekly meetings at Rising Sun, and last summer they finally received a full-time position as a program assistant at the Community Energy Services Corporation in Berkeley. There, they advise small to medium sized businesses on how to lower energy consumption. “Even if I don't make a lot of money, I love my job,” said Johnson.
Under unilateral disarmament, Trump stays, Conyers goes, Moore stays, Franken goes. Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images, Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, Mark Wilson/Getty Images, and Joe Raedle/Getty Images.
Remember “when they go low, we go high?” Yep. So do I.
I remembered it in the fall of 2016, when Senate Republicans and then-candidate Donald Trump first made it irrevocably clear there would be no hearing for anyone Barack Obama nominated to the Supreme Court, ever, even though Obama had put up a moderate, centrist nominee who was once acceptable to Senate Republicans. I remembered it when Trump won, and we realized that that seat would stay stolen.
I remembered it this week when the Senate passed a tax bill at 2 a.m. that apparently contains a $289 billion error, thanks to the fact that it was drafted in the margins rather than adjudicated through normal congressional standards, as, say, Obamacare was.
And I remember it almost daily now, as John Conyers steps down after 52 years in Congress, amid credible allegations of sexual harassment, and Al Franken is called upon to step down, amid credible allegations of sexual harassment, while Roy Moore continues—with the president's and the GOP's overt endorsement—his run for Senate amid credible allegations of sexual abuse of children.
Al Franken, many argue, should now resign. They should resign immediately because there are credible accusers (another emerged Wednesday), and because the behavior alleged is sufficiently abhorrent that there is simply no basis to defend him. In this parade of unilateral disarmament, Trump stays, Conyers goes, Moore stays, Franken goes.
Is this the principled solution? By every metric I can think of, it's correct. But it's also wrong. It's wrong because we no longer inhabit a closed ethical system, in which morality and norm preservation are their own rewards. We live in a broken and corroded system in which unilateral disarmament is going to destroy the very things we want to preserve.
To see the double standard in action, watch Mike Huckabee making the case that Roy Moore should be welcomed into the Senate because Franken has stayed. Then keep watching and realize that in the next breath, they add that Moore has “denied the charges against them vehemently and categorically” so they must be false. Franken and Conyers are deployed by the right to say Moore should stay, and then they are dismissed as suckers for crediting their accusers.
Sexual predation is bad and grotesque and disqualifying for national office and positions of power. Stipulated. Victim-shaming and claiming that “the people should decide” is contemptible avoidance of responsibility. But the question that remains is whether the analysis stops right there. I, too, would like to live in a world where the debate begins and ends with that proposition. But I don't think any of us live in that world anymore. And this may not be the moment in which to try to resurrect it.
You can talk about gradations of harm—what Franken is accused of still pales next to child predation—but even that is a trap. The point is, as Jennifer Rubin notes Tuesday, that “one party has adopted a zero-tolerance position (with Sen. Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, set to go before the ethics committee) and another party opens its arms to people it believes are miscreants.” Rubin feels confident that becoming the party of alleged sexual abusers will harm the GOP in upcoming elections (did they live through last November?). My own larger concern is that becoming the party of high morality will allow Democrats to live with themselves but that the party is also self-neutering in the face of unprecedented threats, in part to do the right thing and in part to take ammunition away from the right—a maneuver that never seems to work out these days. When Al Franken, who has been a champion for women's rights in their tenure in the Senate, leaves, what rushes in to fill the space may well be a true feminist. But it may also be another Roy Moore. And there is something deeply naïve, in a game of asymmetrical warfare, and in a moment of unparalleled public misogyny, in assuming that the feminist gets the seat before it happens.
This isn't a call to become tolerant of awful behavior. It is a call for understanding that Democrats honored the blue slip, and Republicans didn't. Democrats had hearings over the Affordable Care Act; Republicans had none over the tax bill. Democrats decry predators in the media; Republicans give them their own networks. And what do Democrats have to show for it? There is something almost eerily self-regarding in the notion that the only thing that matters is what Democrats do, without considering what the systemic consequences are for everyone.
We are at a moment in this country in which entire institutions that existed to protect women—from the courts, to our criminal statutes, to our workplace protections—have proved not only incapable of protecting us but also to be tools used to shame and silence us. The question we now face is really about which institutions need to be blown apart altogether and recreated to promote justice, and which institutions do not or cannot. The Senate, I would submit, is not about to be blown up and created anew, with greater institutional solicitude for women. Not now. And that means that when it comes to the Senate, we play by the institutional rules and norms as they exist, even as those rules and norms devolve into empty shells. The alternative is a game of righteous ball, in which the object is pride and purity, and Dems are the only ones playing.
In the event that you doubt that the war is asymmetric, ask yourself how long it took for the same GOP that was disavowing Moore a month ago to embrace him, and to embrace them again in the face of new evidence. Ask how long it took from when Trump made it clear that they would wage war on Robert Mueller for Hugh Hewitt—purporting to speak on behalf of “a large swath of responsible center-right observers”—to call for an investigation into Mueller. This because a former FBI official sent pro-Hillary texts that now raise, according to Hewitt, “the possibility of shattering public confidence in a number of long-held assumptions about the criminal-justice system generally and the FBI and the Justice Department specifically.” The president just claimed the FBI is “in tatters,” but it's the former official, who Mueller pulled off the investigation for the texts, who shatters confidence in the agency?
Who knows why the GOP has lost its last ethical moorings? But this is a perfectly transactional moment in governance, and what we get in exchange for being good and moral right now is nothing. I'm not saying we should hit pause on #MeToo, or direct any less fury at sexual predators in their every manifestation. But we should understand that while we know that our good faith and reasonableness are virtues, we currently live in a world where it's also a handicap.
Unilateral disarmament is tantamount to arming the other side. That may be a trade worth making in some cases. But it's worth at least acknowledging that this is the current calculus. It's no longer that when they go low, we get to go high. They are permanently living underground. How long can we afford to keep living in the clouds?
Joseph Gordon-Levitt Placed Ads For ‘Don Jon' On Popular Porn Sites
In Don Jon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Jon, a Jersey Shore-inspired character who has a serious porn addiction who falls for Jersey girl Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), but they have some unrealistic expectations about relationships. The film, which was also written and direct by Gordon-Levitt, features plenty of porn montages, thanks to Jon's porn proclivities. While the indie was made on a small budget, Relativity picked up the film at Sundance earlier this year, and now Don Jon has a large advertising and marketing budget to work with.
So, where did some of that new advertising money go?
To place ads for the movie on porn sites, of course!
A few days ago, a Redditor spotted a takeover ad for Don Jon on porn site Tube8, so when Gordon-Levitt did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit on Wednesday night, GoD alum Tom Cheredar jumped at the chance to ask the actor if part of the marketing budget was being used to place ads for the film on porn sites, to which the filmmaker replied, “Definitely.”
Here's a screenshot of our question and answer on the Joseph Gordon-Levitt Reddit AMA:
[“Did you really use part of your marketing budget for DON JON to advertise on popular porn video sites?” via Reddit AMA.]
As you can see, Gordon-Levitt made sure to add that they were also placing ads for the film in other areas, like “chick flick” stuff (i.e., girly girl stuff) and the NFL (i.e., manly man stuff).
Here's what Gordon-Levitt said about why they chose Scarlett Johansson as their leading lady for Don Jon:
First of all because she's hilarious. See them on SNL? And they balance comedy and sincerity with a delicacy few actors can. Besides that, I thought she'd be a powerful presence in the movie because she's an acute example of what the movie's about. Scarlett is an extremely smart person, and a very talented artist. And yet most of what gets talked about is them looks. This part of our culture is what DON JON is poking fun at.
Judging by the film's description and its trailer (both are here below), it seems like Gordon-Levitt really nails it with this dramady. While the porn addiction angle is being played up, you can tell Don Jon has a lot of heart and humor to it.
Don Jon, which also stars Julianne Moore, Glenne Headly, Brie Larson, and Tony Danza, opens in theaters on September 27.
Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a strong, handsome, good old fashioned guy. Their buddies call them Don Jon due to their ability to “pull” a different woman every weekend, but even the finest fling doesn't compare to the bliss they find alone in front of the computer watching pornography. Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) is a bright, beautiful, good old fashioned girl. Raised on romantic Hollywood movies, she's determined to find their Prince Charming and ride off into the sunset. Wrestling with good old fashioned expectations of the opposite sex, Jon and Barbara struggle against a media culture full of false fantasies to try and find true intimacy in this unexpected comedy written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Ukraine sends 20 tanks and 30 APCs to break resistance in Slavyansk
AP photo
Combat actions in the town of Slavyansk in the south-east of Ukraine continued at night of May 6. At nightfall, the Ukrainian troops launched an attack on the positions of self-defense forces. Two powerful explosions were heard on the outskirts of the city. It was also said that Kiev had sent Grad rocket launchers to the site of the operation.
New units of Ukrainian forces arrived near Slavyansk for the punitive operation against the civilians, who do not agree to live under illegitimate Kiev authorities. In particular, 20 tanks and 30 armored vehicles of various modifications were delivered to Lozovaya railway station. The column moved in the direction of Slavyansk and stopped 20 kilometers from the city.
Prior to that, the Ukrainian military tried to take the village of Semyonovka, a suburb of Slavyansk. Bloody battles continued in the village for two days.
Currently the situation in Slavyansk is quiet. There is no shooting, but self-defense fighters prepare for a possible aggravation of the situation. They do not leave their positions and are ready to fight, should the Ukrainian military start the operation to storm the town.
Civilians still remain blocked in Slavyansk. They could not leave the town as a humanitarian corridor had not been provided for them. Self-defense fighters still control the town. Nothing has been reported about victims of most recent actions.

TreeHugger has done post after post on why people in the United States are fat, detailing everything from the effects of farm policy, suburban develop, the recession, and sedentary lifestyles on the growing number of Americans with soaring Body Mass Indexes. (Lloyd's rounded up many of them here.) It's entirely conventional wisdom at this point that there are more fat people today than there used to be. But there's a chart in a new report on obesity from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that lays this out it stark terms. Check this out:
Both images--taken from the F Is For Fat report [PDF]--show obesity trends in the US among adults, the top from 1991 and the bottom from 2007-2009.
The lightest blue areas have less than 10% obesity rates, the next two blue shades represent 10-20% obesity rates. This is where we were in 1991, with no state in the US (which reported data, the white areas didn't report) having greater than 20% obesity.
The purple is 20-25% obesity, followed by red at 25-30% and orange at greater than 30%. Note that only one state in the 2007-2009 timeframe, Colorado, is in the blue range.
Today our statistically the thinnest state has a 19.1% obesity rate among adults, combined obese and overweight is 55.6%. Our fattest, Mississippi (which was also in the bulging ranks in twenty years ago) has an obesity rate of 33.8%, and a combined rate of 68.6%.
US Was Much Thinner Not That Long Ago
I bring this all up not to just pour more fuel on the fire--though the scale of this is such even that couldn't hurt--but to point out that you don't have to go back to the 1970s and 1980s to find a country of thinner people; you just have to go back to the early 1990s. For many TreeHugger readers (and this author) it's not our childhoods we're talking about, it's our late teens when the great fattening took hold.
Stop Supporting Agri-Business and Start Helping Smaller Farmers is Big Part of Solution
Since we've covered this all pretty thoroughly before, check out the TreeHugger archives (linked at top) and the report itself (linked below the images) for an in-depth look at all this.
But if it's the top-line causes and solutions that you're looking for, the following summary from SmartPlanet is about as accurate and succinct as can be reported, so I'll just quote at length:
Our obesity epidemic is not a demand problem. It's a supply problem. The mass production creates the mass production, as illustrated in the 1955 cartoon (subsidized by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation) Heir-Conditioned.
Current U.S. Department of Agriculture programs still support low cost, mass production of protein, starch, and corn-based sugar. Some of these specific programs date from the Great Depression. Because current market incentives, imposed by the government, encourage factory production of protein and mass production of high fructose corn syrup, we have (surprise) super-cheap, mass-produced chicken, pork, beef, and sweet treats. Changing those policies won't be easy, because there's a vast industry -- much of it now geared to export -- that has grown fat on those policies. Companies like Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and Archer Daniels Midland have grown fat on our current system of subsidies. So have our fast food chains. So have our food manufacturers. These companies, and others, will argue that any move to bring food production closer to home, to encourage truck farming and vegetables, or to reduce their subsidies in any way threatens mass starvation, here and around the world. The opposite is the case. Because we subsidize exports of grain, sugar and protein, African, Asian and South American markets can't develop. And because we subsidize for export, we can't either. The answer to the obesity epidemic lies in changing our production incentives. Take the price supports off mass produced grain and feed, give them to small local truck farms and sustainable production methods. Then export expertise, which is more valuable than corn syrup anyway.

By the Pac-12 Conference
ALLEN CRABBE NAMED MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR; JAHII CARSON and SHABAZZ MUHAMMAD EARN CO-FRESHMAN OF THE YEAR HONORS; ANDRÉ ROBERSON EARNS DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR HONORS: DWIGHT POWELL EARNS MOST IMPROVED PLAYER OF THE YEAR; DANA ALTMAN HONORED AS THE JOHN WOODEN COACH OF THE YEAR
WALNUT CREEK, Calif. - In a vote of the 12 Conference coaches, CALIFORNIA junior guard Allen Crabbe has been named the 2012-13 Pac-12 Men's Basketball Player of the Year; ARIZONA STATE guard Jahii Carson and UCLA guard Shabazz Muhammad have been named Pac-12 Co-Freshman of the Year; COLORADO junior forward André Roberson has been named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year; STANFORD junior forward Dwight Powell has been named Pac-12 Most Improved Player of the Year; and Dana Altman of OREGON is the John Wooden Coach of the Year, Commissioner Larry Scott announced today.
The Complete Conference Honors:
PAC-12 PLAYER OF THE YEAR
CRABBE was instrumental in leading Cal to a tie for second in the Pac-12 standings, and to its fourth 20-win season in five years. They become the seventh Golden Bear to earn Pac-12 Player of the Year honors, joining Jason Kidd (1994), Shareef Abdur-Rahim (1996), Ed Gray (1997), Sean Lampley (2001), Jerome Randle (2010) and Jorge Gutierrez (2012). Crabbe averaged 18.6 points per game/1st in Pac-12 and 6.0 rebounds per game/20th in the Pac-12. In addition, they were among the league leaders in free throw percentage (.810/6th), steals (1.2 spg/14th), three-point field goals made per game (2.0 pg/5th) and minutes played (36.1 mpg/2nd). Should they lead the league in scoring through the postseason, they would become the eighth different Cal player to lead the league in scoring since 1994. They currently have 1,489 career points, good for 10th all-time on the Cal career scoring list.
PAC-12 CO-FRESHMAN OF THE YEAR
CARSON becomes the fourth Arizona State player to earn Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, and first since 2003, joining Byron Scott (1980), Jamal Faulkner (1991), and Ike Diogu (2003). Carson has logged more minutes than any other player this season, averaging 37.0 minutes per game. He's among the league's top five in scoring and assists, currently averaging 17.7 points per game (4th in the Pac-12) and 5.0 assists per game (3rd in the Pac-12). He's posted 14 20-point games this season, tied for most in the league with Pac-12 Player of the Year Allen Crabbe.
MUHAMMAD becomes the eighth UCLA player to earn Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, and first since 2008, joining Pooh Richardson (1986), Don MacLean (1989), Baron Davis (1998) Jason Kapono (2000), Jordan Farmar (2005), Luc Richard Mbah a Moute (2006), and Kevin Love (2008). Muhammad was a key piece all season for Pac-12 regular season champion UCLA, leading the Bruins in scoring (18.3 ppg/3rd in Pac-12) and three-point field goal percentage (.417/3rd in Pac-12), and was second in assists (3.7 apg/8th in Pac-12). They posted 13 20-point games this season and added three double-doubles. Muhammad was one of only two freshmen (also teammate Kyle Anderson) to be named Player of the Week this season, earning the honor following a 27-point effort in a win over Missouri.
PAC-12 DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR
ROBERSON was key on defense for Colorado this year, as the Buffs limited their opponents to a Pac-12 best 62.2 points per game in league play. They led the league with 11.5 rebounds per game and 2.3 steals per game, while also contributing with 1.4 block shots per game (8th in the Pac-12). Their 1,019 career rebounds are second all-time at Colorado.
PAC-12 MOST IMPROVED PLAYER OF THE YEAR
POWELL is ninth in scoring in the Pac-12 (15.1 ppg) and eighth in the league in rebounds (8.2 rpg) this season. Powell's numbers improved from their sophomore season when they averaged 5.8 points and 4.6 rebounds. In addition, they scored in double figures in all 18 league games, had eight 20-point games and nine double-doubles this season.
PAC-12 COACH OF THE YEAR
ALTMAN guided Oregon to a second-place tie in the Pac-12 standings after being picked by the media in the preseason to finish seventh. Under Altman, the Ducks have posted their second consecutive second-place finish and third consecutive 20-win season. Altman has now won Coach of the Year honors in four different conferences - Pac-12 (Oregon, 2013), Missouri Valley (Creighton, 2001 and 2002), Big Eight (Kanas State, 1993), and Southern (Marshall, 1990). He's the third Oregon coach to receive Pac-12 Coach of the Year honors, joining Dick Harter (1977) and Ernie Kent (2002). Altman has a career record of 478-277 (.633), while their Oregon record stands at 68-34 (.667).
THE VOTE: Coach of the Year, All-Conference, All-Freshman, All-Defensive teams and Most Improved Player are voted on by the coaches. Coaches are not permitted to vote for themselves or their own players for the honors.
The Democratic Party isn't righteous, exactly. It isn't particularly good either. It isn't disciplined or organized or brave, but to hear them tell it, none of that matters, because the Democratic Party is smart, and you're smart to be in it. For 30 years, as the Clinton era became the Dean era became the Obama era and any pretense of serious ideological difference with the G.O.P. gave way to a generation of Democrats mumbling half-heartedly about how yes, they love small business owners too, and yes, the War on Terror is deadly serious of course, and no, our energy corporations must be allowed to extract and monetize their corpses from beneath the skin of our dying world (how else do we create jobs? We, the Democrats, also love jobs!), this has been the party's central pitch: We'll do everything the G.O.P. can do, but better. Because we're open to evidence. We've got better charts. We are slightly less racist, nevermind the prisons and the poverty and the drones. Now, as the sound of Donald Trump screaming at their television drifts out daily over the Rose Garden, the Democratic pitch has never sounded better.
Replacing ideological politics with a politics predicated on knowledge asymmetries, with Democrats as the wonk-heroes required, of course, the reinvention of the Republican Party as well. The trouble with our opponents, said Democrats, is not that they're evil. We're all Americans here, after all. We all believe in America. The trouble is that these guys are dumb as hell, and the Democrats don't know what to do with them.
Reagan ended the “era of big government,” and Clinton confirmed it — their welfare reform was smart. John Kerry would grind Iraqi bones into irradiated dust as well anyone — but he'd be strategic about it. Obama, famously, didn't do “stupid shit,” and their drone war, their banking policies, their plagiarized Heritage Foundation health care plan all reflected this: the point was not what Obama did, it was how clever they seemed doing it. If there was a shred of pretense to moral superiority left, it was abandoned entirely by the Hillary Clinton campaign, where competence and experience, from economic advisor Michael Shapiro (a 29-year-old whose primary qualifications appeared to consist of being Chuck Schumer's son-in-law and a Yale alum in good standing) to “good friend” Henry Kissinger (a drooling, jowly vampire whose primary qualification appeared to be the capacity to sleep at night), could stand in as an excuse for any kind of depravity.
John Kerry would grind Iraqi bones into irradiated dust as well anyone — but he'd be strategic about it.
What these woke dupe-servants of capital stood against were not devils, but zombies. Reagan was an actor and a fool, George W. Bush was the ur-hick, misunderpronounciating their bi-partisan genocide in the Middle East. As this account of the G.O.P. filtered out into the mainstream, into DailyKos blogs and Daily Show clips, the blathering dumbass account of politics came to consume Republican voters. It did not matter that the G.O.P. routinely defeated Democrats at every level of government, that they imposed their will with a discipline and energy that liberal reserve for earnest 100-post responses to every Trump tweet, or that these idiots managed to drag the entire country to the right over the course of a few decades and despite the resistance of almost every intellectual and demographic current.
Even the ostensible moral concerns of Republican leaders and voters were swallowed up by pedantry: If you were pro-life, or pro-gun, or a bigot, the trouble wasn't that you were evil, the trouble was that you hadn't read the right studies yet. You were factually incorrect about your own religion. “You have the vote of every thinking person in this country!” an admirer didn't really shout to Adlai Stevenson during the 1956 presidential race. “I'm sorry ma'am, but we need a majority!” they didn't really shout back. You can hear Toby Zeigler telling this story, and you can hear everyone you ever knew with an internship at O.F.A. repeating it. The arctic permafrost is melting, the ghouls of long dead viruses are emerging from the ice, carried up on methane vapor to spread across the unsuspecting earth, and this is the state of our politics.
Trump keeps telling us they don't know what he's doing, and nobody, it seems, will listen.
Until it wasn't. After the election Trump, who during the campaign had been pilloried with the same look-at-this-idiot routine (he doesn't even know how to start a land war in the Middle East right), found themselves suddenly transformed into an evil mastermind. Trump was a fascist, carefully plotting their consolidation of power. Shadowy counselors like genius Steve Bannon (who was once seen reading a whole book in an airport) were plotting to bring America to its knees with post-Leninist theory. The whole scheme was being orchestrated by the Russians, our classically devious foe. When the White House announced the sudden firing of FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, liberal pundit Chris Hayes tweeted, “The White House has made the calculation that however bad this looks, it's better than letting Comey continue to supervise the investigation.” The story has been the same all year: everywhere, Trump's White House is staying one step ahead of the best sleuths in the business, setting up back channels and secret deals, making astute calculations like cackling laser villains in a James Bond movie.
This is a curious development, mainly because Trump really is a dumbass.  They are profoundly stupid. This is obvious.  They are as stupid as liberals pretended George Bush to be, probably even dumber than that. They appear before us on a million television screens as a sputtering child, choking half-remembered words out from a drooping chin asphyxiated by daddy's tie. They have spent their whole life being stupid, failing upward through a business world that celebrates the terminally idiotic, unable-to-distinguish any more between themselves and the man they have played in so many versions on television. The trouble is not that they don't read white papers, it's that they have spent their entire life belching the alphabet and if it worked, and it did work, he's as shocked as anyone. “I loved my previous life. I had so many things going,” the president told Reuters last month, “This is more work than my previous life. I thought it would be easier.” If Trump is a wise man, they are only wise in the Socratic sense: they keep telling us they don't know what he's doing, and nobody, it seems, will listen.
This is a curious development, mainly because Trump really is a dumbass.  They are profoundly stupid. This is obvious.
To compound the country's political situation, Trump is an idiot surrounded by idiots. Jared Kushner jets around the world in their designer Kevlar vest, screeching that he's not a cuck. Steve Bannon gurgles half-remembered race slurs through alcoholic bile, fumbling for the light switch in the Oval. Sean Spicer goes out wide-eyed and empty to the press corps, a salve for anyone who has ever worried that they aren't quite up to their jobs, and tells them that Hitler never gassed anyone in their life. The incompetence of the Trump administration is not just a matter of cosmetics. Say what you will about George W. Bush, but an immigration order from their office would have been vetted by every top-notch torture memo writer in the building, with national guard units stationed around the airports for the big day. Trump begins their march to fascist power with a series of uninterrupted, humiliating defeats at the hands of judiciary and legislative branches controlled by their own party. History is filled with men who have managed to be evil and stupid at the same time, but if we have learned anything these past few months, it is that there is a stupidity so deeply planted that evil trips over it on the way to the store.
It does not even matter, really, whether or not Trump's election was the result of an elaborate, multi-year Kremlin plot to install the guy from The Apprentice in the West Wing. If it was, then it is the most ineptly covered up conspiracy we have ever seen: every half-bit sleuth online isn't figuring this out because the administration is being subtle. But there's also a simpler explanation for all the too-good-to-be-true evidence: These people are idiots, and assholes, and no matter what Chris Hayes says, they've never made a “calculation” in their lives.
Say what you will about George W. Bush, but an immigration order from their office would have been vetted by every top-notch torture memo writer in the building.
For 30 years, the Democratic Party sold itself as the last bulwark against slightly dumber managers of our imperial decline. Now, faced with a real incarnation of that fantasy, a Republican leader who even Aaron Sorkin would rewrite for lack of subtlety, they have transformed themselves into underdogs, racing to save the world from an evil genius.
The reasons for all of this become far clearer when you recall that, of course, nobody in a position of power in Washington really gives a shit about the Russians. They really don't. Beyond vague feelings that undefined tampering in our elections is bad, nobody can tell you what, precisely, Trump has done or even could do on the level of material policy that benefits Vladimir Putin, except those things that the Republican Party was going to do anyway. They haven't even lived up to expectations. We're bombing Syria. NATO is “good” again. Yes, rolling back environmental protections is excellent for a petro-state, but it's difficult to imagine President Jeb! Bush throwing their full weight behind the Paris Treaty.
The objection, after all, cannot be to outside electoral influence in principle. Powerful entities have always had interests that run contrary to those of the American people, and those entities have routinely used their financial power or public relations outfits to meddle in our electoral process. It's only that these entities are ordinarily multinational corporation, and the principle difference between the meddling of a multinational corporation and the meddling of Russia is that I can tell you precisely what a multinational corporation gets in policy concessions and regulatory kickbacks when they help elect an unpopular political candidate. And this really, is where this whole strange Democratic shift starts to become clear: This was supposed to be their game.
When the Democrats began their transformation into the part of smarter, kinder reactionaries, they abandoned what flimsy claim they had left to a natural base within the country. The savagery of the G.O.P. helped a bit, but the smarter-manager pitch was never meant to appeal to voters. It was meant to appeal to money. For decades, the Republican Party had been plied its advantage with our financial masters, losing the more populist House but winning nearly every presidential election in the second half of the 20th century by aligning itself with the true source of American power. The Democrats upended this with a simple plea: We'll do your bidding, but we'll do it better. We'll sigh while we vote to authorize the next war, we'll shake our head over what a shame it is that we must destroy the welfare state. The planet will shriek and howl in pain, and we will promise market-based solutions, based on the latest research, with all indications suggesting that nothing significant will have to change for your grandchildren to be obscenely wealthy too. The ploy worked. When Barack Obama and then Hillary Clinton managed to capture the advantage in Wall Street money and support, Democrats celebrated their success.
Now Trump, who knows nothing, has stolen the cynical con right out from under them. In their hearts, they know they didn't even try — Vladimir Putin, the probable richest man on Earth, just stepped in and did it for him. Game recognizes game. Trump didn't even have to sell their platform or their soul. Democrats wanted to fight the idiot Republican Party, the one that chased rubes in the country. But the new Republican Party, with its choking, spitting figurehead, has beat the best number-crunching managers of hell at their own game. My God. They must be some kind of genius.

Blackburn Rovers confirm that following discussions with the Football League the club is now compliant with the rules and regulations on Financial Fair Play.
During the past 12 months, the Board of Directors and staff have worked hard to ensure that the necessary requirements have been put in place to satisfy the Football League.
This has been achieved through a number of measures being undertaken, most notably, the Owners agreeing and implementing a loan conversion agreement, effective cost efficiency savings and player sales, which were limited to reflect the needs of the team and football management.
The Owners and Board of Directors feel it prudent to proceed with restraint, in order to give the club the best possible environment to continue to be compliant in subsequent years, however all efforts will continue to be made to provide the manager, Paul Lambert, and football staff to work effectively and efficiently.
The club wishes to put on record its thanks to the Football League for its co-operation during this period.
Glass Beach is the well-known southern beach of MacKerricher State Park in Fort Bragg. Glass Beach gets its name from the smooth colorful glass pieces that you can find in the pebbly beach. The site was once a trash dump so broken bottles from garbage cans of local residents are now little treasures to be found and photographed (and left behind). It is illegal to remove any glass from Glass Beach. This is a great place to take kids who can explore around but watch them near the water which can be dangerous. There is a wide path to the beach from the parking area on Glass Beach Road a couple blocks west of Highway 1 down West Elm Street. There are more trails on the bluff to hike north up to Pudding Creek Beach where a paved multi-use trail crosses over an old train trestle. Trails also go south from the Glass Beach entry path to other glassy beaches that are outside of the state park boundary.
The rapidly warming climate will melt Greenland's ice cap to such an extent that thousands of tons of hazardous waste left in the 1960s by a secret U.S. military base will be unearthed by the end of the century, new research finds.
The biological, chemical, and radioactive waste will then seep into the ground and the sea, endangering humans and animals alike.
"This stuff was going to come out anyway, but what climate change did was press the gas pedal to the floor and say, 'it's going to come out a lot faster than you thought.'"
—James White, University of ColoradoThe study published Thursday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters discovered that if today's rate of global warming continues unabated, within the next 75 years more ice will be melting than will be replaced by new snowfall.
"Once the site transitions from net snowfall to net melt, it's only a matter of time before the wastes melt out; it becomes irreversible," the study's lead author, William Colgan, said in a statement from the American Geophysical Union.
The waste was abandoned by Camp Century, a 200-person camp that resembled a city built under the ice. Built a mere 800 miles from the North Pole in subzero temperatures, its construction was a remarkable feat of engineering. The base was ostensibly created for scientific research, but its top-secret reason for existing was to test the feasibility of a network of nuclear launch sites within the Greenland ice sheet, a task known as Project Iceworm.
The base was in operation from 1959 to 1966, and Project Iceworm was canceled—when it became clear that unpredictable and extreme shifts in the ice sheet made it impossible—in 1963.
After Camp Century closed, "the military removed a portable nuclear reactor that had helped power the 200-person base, but left the rest of the waste there, from gasoline to PCBs and nuclear coolant water," Mashable noted.
Mashable reported that the study authors estimated that Camp Century "hosts approximately 9,200 tons of physical waste associated with abandoned infrastructure—equivalent to the mass of 33 Airbus A380s super jumbo jets, along with 20,000 liters of chemical waste associated with base fuel. This is about equivalent to the volume of a full-size tanker truck."
The outlet continued:
In addition, [the researchers] calculated that there is likely about 24 million liters of biological waste (mainly sewage), along with radioactive coolant water from the reactor. SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
The total area of the facility sprawls across about 136 acres, the study found, or about 100 football fields. The study indicates that the most significant threat to the Arctic environment from the buried waste are polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which do not break down naturally in the environment and can build up in plants and animals, potentially causing cancer in humans.
The U.S. military assumed that the region's constant snowfall would entomb the waste in ice for many thousands of years.
"Two generations ago, people were interring waste in different areas of the world, and now climate change is modifying those sites," Colgan noted.
Indeed, as James White, a University of Colorado climate scientist who wasn't involved in the study, wrote in the American Geophysical Union statement: "This stuff was going to come out anyway, but what climate change did was press the gas pedal to the floor and say, 'it's going to come out a lot faster than you thought.'"
"The ice sheet that sits on Greenland is melting at an alarming rate, as much as 8,000 tons per second, said Colgan. This equates to 280 billion tons of ice melting and calving off into the ocean each year," USA Today wrote.
And the resulting seepage of radioactive, biological, and chemical waste will not only be an environmental disaster, the researchers noted. The issue also creates a political quandary: Camp Century was allowed to exist thanks to a U.S.-Denmark treaty—but its nuclear missile experiment was kept secret from the Danish government. Moreover, today Greenland is an independent country.
In addition, while international law "is clear about responsibility for preventing future hazardous waste," it is "ambiguous about who is liable for waste already discarded," Jessica Green, a political scientist specializing in international environmental law at New York University, told the American Geophysical Union.
Thus, the looming threat of unearthed nuclear and other hazardous waste "represents an entirely new pathway of political dispute resulting from climate change," the study authors observed.
The inclusion of beef in our diets isn't just a problem for climate change, climate change is posing a major threat to beef. Years of ongoing drought -- which climate change may be contributing to now, and will certainly make more likely in the future -- have driven the meat's prices to an all-time high, the L.A. Times reports: up to $5.28 a pound for choice-grade steak. To put that in context, its price at the same time last year was $4.91; back in 2008, it sold for a mere $3.97. To put that in further context, a fresh, whole chicken sells for $1.50 per pound; boneless breast costs $3.38.
The drought isn't going anywhere soon, and neither, the Times adds, are the high prices:
Advertisement:
Soaring beef prices are being blamed on years of drought throughout the western and southern U.S. The dry weather has driven up the price of feed such as corn and hay to record highs, forcing many ranchers to sell off their cattle. That briefly created a glut of beef cows for slaughter that has now run dry. The nation's cattle population has fallen to 87.7 million, the lowest since 1951, when there were 82.1 million on hand, according to the USDA. (The peak was 1975, with 132 million heads of cattle, but the animals then were less meaty and required more feed). "We're dealing with chronically low herds," said Richard Volpe, an economist for the USDA. "Beef prices should remain at near-record highs this year and into 2015."
According to Jerry Haines, the general manager of a small meat business, slaughterhouses are reserving their limited supplies for big fast-food chains. "This whole thing now is being driven by hamburger," they told the Times. "You take all the McDonald's and Burger Kings across the United States; the amount of meat needed to make those hamburgers is forcing the value of other cuts of meat to go up." But they're not safe from the shortage, either: Dollar menus, experts say, may soon be a luxury they can no longer afford.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer wasn't a new character when the TV show of the same name premiered on this day in 1997 — a poorly reviewed movie version had come out five years earlier, and creator Joss Whedon's desire to do it again and do it right quickly became part of the Buffy creation mythology.
Nearly two decades later, it's easy to see that doing Buffy right wasn't just a matter of improving its casting, creative freedom and sense of humor. In addition to all those aces, Whedon — now a bona fide blockbuster builder — was also an early comer to the socially conscious, feminism-friendly attitude that has redefined the pop-culture landscape in more recent years.

Need proof? Just look at a feature about teen-centric television that TIME ran a few months after Buffy took to the airwaves as a mid-season replacement. The piece called Buffy “the most talked-about show to have debuted in the past months” and included an interview with Whedon, who was forthright about their stake (no pun intended) in the show's feminist cred:
Producers of these shows understand that preachiness lures no one. Says Joss Whedon, creator of the Buffy movie and series and a former writer on Roseanne: “If I can make teenage boys comfortable with a girl who takes charge of a situation without their knowing that's what's happening, it's better than sitting down and selling them on feminism.” The original idea for Buffy came to Whedon after years spent watching horror movies in which “bubblehead blonds wandered into dark alleys and got murdered by some creature.” Thought Whedon: “I would love to see a movie in which a blond wanders into a dark alley, takes care of themselves and deploys their powers.” The series gives the idea more dimension. Buffy, like many of their TV peers, must deal with an absurdly clueless parent (her mom doesn't know she's a vampire slayer); the insularity of generic suburbia (Buffy lives in familiar but fictional Sunnydale, Daria in Lawndale); and a dumb but popular nemesis, Cordelia, who sets out to test Buffy‘s coolness quotient on Buffy‘s first day at school. “Vamp nail polish?” Cordelia inquires. “So over,” Buffy confidently answers. “John Tesh?” Cordelia persists. “The devil,” Buffy replies. Beyond the reference barrage that is Buffy churns a wry, ongoing parable of the modern woman's greatest conflict: the challenge to balance personal and professional life. Buffy, you see, has been designated as the sole vampire slayer of their generation. When the bloodsuckers emerge, they must be there to make mincemeat out of them. But what to do on a night when a 12th century prophecy has proclaimed that the world could come to an end, and a cute boy named Owen, an Emily Dickinson lover even, has finally asked you out? This is, of course, Buffy‘s unending dilemma.

Everyday we chow down on food produced from plants that carry deadly poisons. Most of the time we don't need to be concerned with this as the mass production of fruit and vegetables ensures that we are usually safe, but from time to time people accidentally kill themselves by unwittingly eating the wrong part of a plant. In order to ensure that this never happens to you, I have put together a list of the most commonly seen poisons that we come in to contact with in our kitchens.
10. Cassava (Yuca)
Though not too widely used in the United States, cassava is a woody shrub that is generally found in the Caribbean and South America. When using cassava, it can either be made to be sweet or bitter. The taste, as well as the smell, all depends on the amount of cyanogenic glucosides, which are in fact, extremely poisonous. Most who prepare it like it to be bitter, as it keeps away insects and even animals. If cassava is prepared incorrectly, it can be deadly. Cassava poisoning, due to high levels of cyanide, is known as Konzo. Cassava poisoning leads to irreversible paralysis.
Interesting fact: Cassava roots are ground into a flour-like substance which is then used to make tapioca. Cassava leaves contain cyanide but if pounded into a paste with flour and left in the shade for 5 hours, the cyanide is broken down.
9. Pufferfish
Pufferfish stand to be the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world. Though you won't find pufferfish in the U.S., many in Korea as well as Japan finds some parts of the fish to be delicacies. However, certain organs of the fish, such as the liver, as extremely toxic, and can be deadly. The poison in the fish, known as tetrodotoxin, can cause numbness, high blood pressure, and muscle paralysis, which is what leads to death as the diaphragm muscles become paralyzed, disabling breathing. Known as fugu when eaten as a meal, many in Asian countries refuse to not eat the fish.
Interesting fact: Pufferfish has been made illegal to be eaten by the Emperor of Japan.
8. Mushrooms
There are about 5000 types of mushrooms known in the U.S. and about 100 of them are said to be toxic, while less than a dozen are deadly. In any case, mushrooms can cause gastrointestinal discomfort. Since mushrooms are fungi and the fact that there are so many species, it can be hard to know which are poisonous. As rule of thumb, it is usually said that any mushroom found in the wild are more than likely poisonous. One of the deadliest types of mushroom toxins is Alpha-amanitin, which causes extreme liver damage. Toadstools, as they are called, are the poisonous mushrooms.
Interesting fact: There are 38,000 known kinds of mushrooms; about 5% of these are toxic.
7. Cashews
Though really seeds and not nuts, cashews grow inside of a shell-like structure that grows on a fruit. When buying “raw cashews” in the store, take note that these nuts have actually been steamed and are not entirely raw. This is because raw cashews contain urushiol, which is the same chemical that you'd find in poison ivy. It can cause the body to have a very similar reaction to one experienced from poison oak or ivy. If a high level of urushiol is ingested, it can be deadly. Cashew poisoning is rare, but those who handle them in order to manufacture them to get the shell off sometimes experience the side-effects.
Interesting fact: Cashews come from a fruit, which in South American countries, is eaten, and the seeds (cashews) are then thrown away.
6. Chilies
You've probably eaten a chili or two in your life. No matter if it was an extremely hot one, or one that was pretty mild, every chili you have ever consumed has contained a chemical called capsaicin. In chilies, capsaicin is what makes them spicy and “hot.” Of course one chili won't hurt, but if you eat enough of them, capsaicin can kill you. The chemical is so strong that it is used as a paint stripper, and it is even used in pepper spray used by police forces. In hotter chilies, such as habaneros, capsaicin can be felt on the skin if you cut the chili, as it will produce a burning sensation.
Interesting fact: Chilies are extremely high in vitamin C. One green chili pod is said to contain about 6 times as much vitamin C.
5. Potatoes
We've all heard something or another about potatoes. Whether it is the potato famine, some Irish story, or some other historical event centered on potatoes, one thing you may not have heard of is that potatoes are toxic. The stem and leaves of the plant are toxic, and even the potato itself is toxic. If you've ever looked at a potato, you may have realized that some turn a greenish color. This is due to levels of glycoalkaloid poison. In the past, there have been deaths due to potato poisoning. It is rare, but most happen due to someone drinking potato leaf tea, or eating green potatoes. Death doesn't come suddenly. It usually results in weakness and then a coma. Don't worry about having the occasional green potato chip, but do discard any potatoes that have green eyes, sprouts, or greenish skins, rather than prepare and serve them, especially to children.
Interesting fact: Potatoes make great food for astronaut! In fact in 1995 potato plants were taken into orbit on the Columbia and actually grown.
4. Almonds
Almonds, most always said to be nuts, are actually seeds and are extremely popular in kitchens around the world. Much like cashews, almonds are extremely poisonous if not introduced to some sort of heat source. It is generally the bitter almonds that need to be treated to get rid of the poison. The seeds are full of cyanide, and in many countries are illegal to sell without having been processed in order to get rid of the poison within the seed.
Interesting fact: Almonds are said to be one of the earliest cultivated foods, being mentioned in the Bible's Old Testament.
3. Cherries
Cherries are definitely one of the most versatile fruits. You can eat them raw, cook them, bake them, and get them tart or sweet. Cherries can even be used in certain types of liquor. Despite their overall red goodness, cherries are toxic. If you've ever eaten a cherry and without thought chewed on the pip or left it in your mouth, you more than likely introduced hydrogen cyanide into your body. If a cherry pip is chewed, crushed, or somehow damaged, it automatically produces hydrogen cyanide. Symptoms of mild poisoning include headache, dizziness, confusion, anxiety, and vomiting. Larger doses can lead to difficulty breathing, increased blood pressure and heart rate, and kidney failure. Reactions can include coma, convulsions, and death from respiratory arrest.
Interesting fact: Cherries contain extremely high amounts of Melatonin which is good for helping and keeping the body regulated.
2. Apples
Apples are definitely a popular fruit no matter where you go. Like others on the list, and many other types of fruits, apples contain cyanide, but not in high levels. The fruit itself does not contain the chemical, but you will find cyanide in the apple's seeds. Eating all of the seeds in one apple won't kill you, but it's definitely not recommended. Of course, if enough apple seeds are eaten, this means chewed and swallowed, it can result in complications.
Interesting fact: Apples float because at least 25% of their mass is nothing but air.
1. Tomato
Despite the extreme popularity of tomatoes and many countries, it is true that they are poisonous. Though the fruit itself doesn't contain poison, the stem as well as the leaves contain a chemical known as glycoalkaloid. Higher levels are said to be found in wild tomatoes, but those grown domestically still contain glycoalkaloid. This chemical is known to cause upset stomachs and nervousness. The leaves and stem can be used in cooking for flavor, but must be removed before eating. This chemical is so powerful that it is actually used as a way to control pests.
Interesting fact: In 1893, in the U.S. Supreme Court case Nix v. Hedden, it was argued whether or not a tomato was a vegetable or a fruit, which dealt with taxes being paid on vegetbles and not fruits. In the end, the court ruled that a tomato is a vegetable when referring to the Tariff Act, but is botanically a fruit.
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
CHRIS, mid 20s, sits in a tattered recliner with a shaker of
G Fuel, playing a video game on one TV while two other TVs
display paused games, a nearby desktop computer plays a
movie, and music blares from a stereo.
CHRIS
Yeah! Video games!
All the electronics abruptly shut off.
CHRIS
What the fuck?!
Chris stands up, taking a swig of their G Fuel, and turns
toward a dozen frayed power cords plugged into several
splitters on one wall outlet. They trip and spills G Fuel all
over the cords.
CHRIS
Goddamn it! Now I need more G
Fuel!
A light fixture falls from the ceiling, startling Chris as it
hits the floor.
CHRIS
Shit!
LOUIE THE LIGHTNING BUG flies down out of the hole in the
ceiling where the fixture was attached.
LOUIE
Hi! Louie the Lightning Bug here.
CHRIS
Louie? What the hell are you doing
in my ceiling?
LOUIE
(singing)
I just stopped by to see / If
you're playing safe around
electricity
CHRIS
I can't play anything around
electricity because I don't have
any of it right now!
LOUIE
Maybe your bill is past its due /
Or maybe I got in your walls and
disconnected you
CHRIS
What? Why would you cut my power?!
LOUIE
A rat bastard stole my weed / So
payback from them is what I need
CHRIS
Well it wasn't me, so turn my power
back on.
LOUIE
I think you're lying to my face /
You were the last visitor at my
place
CHRIS
Dude, I was just giving you back
the bong I borrowed. Maybe your
beatnik spider friend did it.
LOUIE
Don't pin it on Daddy-O Longlegs /
I'll let all this go for about
three kegs
CHRIS
Screw you! Get out now or I'm
reporting you to the landlord. I
don't know why you live across from
me anyway. Aren't you famous?
LOUIE
I got a lot of work in '84 / Not so
much anymore
CHRIS
Yeah, well, don't take it out on
me. I can get you evicted for
messing with the wiring.
LOUIE
They might also have some pretty
harsh words / About you using all
those chewed-up cords
Chris lets out an annoyed groan.
CHRIS
Fine! I admit it! I took your
weed! Jeez!
They shove their hand into a rip in their recliner and pulls out a
bag of marijuana.
CHRIS
Here. Happy now?
They throw the bag at Louie, who catches it.
CHRIS
I thought you'd be cool about it,
but I guess not.
LOUIE
(to camera)
Smart kid.
CHRIS
Just turn my power back on!
LOUIE
I'm feelin' nice today / So I'll
fix it all without delay
Louie takes the bag and flies up into the hole in the
ceiling. Chris sighs in exasperation.
CHRIS
Friggin' hell, dude.
LOUIE (O.S.)
Here you go!
The wet, frayed power cords explode with sparks, flames
shooting up the wall from the outlet.
CHRIS
Oh god!
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Smoke billows from the roof. A fire truck is parked in the
street, lights flashing.
Louie watches from a distance. They take a hit from the large
joint he's holding with all four hands, their light-bulb body
glowing brighter. They then turns to the camera.
LOUIE
Remember, little buddies...
(singing)
If you steal from Louie, even one
little bit / An electrical fire
might fuck up your shit!
THE END
Female fans of the superhero genre found a lot to love with the first season of Netflix's Jessica Jones, starting with Krysten Ritter's endlessly watchable performance as the show's prickly, tormented protagonist. It's a groundbreaking show that's delved into topics most mainstream shows — never mind Marvel properties — eschew, such as post-traumatic-stress disorder, sexual assault, and the complexity of female friendship.
The second season has a lot to live up to in terms of narrative and performance, but showrunner Melissa Rosenberg and their team are doubling down on Jessica Jones' message of female empowerment by hiring female directors for every episode of the second season.
Ava DuVernay's Queen Sugar was the first TV show to exclusively hire female directors for every episode of its season. The director of 13th, Selma, and the upcoming adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time, made sure to include a handful of newcomers, along with an emphatically diverse writers' room and cast.
The most recent diversity report from the DGA showed an increase in female directors and directors of color during the 2015–2016 TV season compared to the year before, but the numbers are still fairly dismal. 2017 might not be much better, especially when stalwarts like Game of Thrones aren't budging.
As DuVernay told the Cut in September, “Our crew on Queen Sugar was like the United Nations, and it's the same thing I'm doing on A Wrinkle in Time. It's like, ‘All department heads, please, do not bring me the same people you've been using the last 20 years.' So I'm constantly pushing — even if the industry is thinking that maybe me or Ryan [Coogler] or the handful of us that are doing it are enough. You know it's not all about getting in that door and reading in that room. Now there are other rooms, and we can create new spaces.”
Reaching a deal with developers for a new $300 million convention center hotel took 18 months of complex negotiations designed to limit public financing, city officials said Monday in announcing the project.
The key challenge was Mayor Sly James' demand that the city not be on the hook if the proposed 800-room Hyatt, across the street from the Kansas City Convention Center's Grand Ballroom, fails to perform as expected.
The city said that in order to avoid the kind of multi-year funding commitment it incurred when tax revenues at the Power & Light District failed to meet projections, it will not back debt on a convention hotel.
“The task of bringing in mostly private dollars for this kind of deal was herculean,” said Bob Swerdling, who along with Kansas City development lawyer Michael Burke has formed the development partnership of Burke Swerdling & Associates.

Recent convention center hotels in other cities are all city-owned, said Swerdling, a national expert in hotel financing who has helped construct deals for convention hotels around the country.
The Kansas City hotel plan would require the city to commit about $2.3 million a year for 25 years with funds generated by convention and tourism taxes, which are mostly paid by out-of-town visitors.
The plan also calls for two Tax Increment Financing incentives and the creation of a Community Improvement District to allow the hotel's operators to collect a 1-cent sales tax.
Under a standard TIF incentive, all of the additional city and county taxes generated by improvements to the hotel site would be diverted to the developers for 23 years. Under a Super TIF deal, all of the additional city taxes generated for 30 years would go to the developers.
The incentive plans require TIF Commission and City Council approvals, which developers hope to get by Aug. 1.
Burke said the private investors will start writing “big checks immediately” and will account for about $150 million in equity and debt to finance the project. The rest of the project's costs will be covered by the capture of the TIF funds and the 1-cent improvement district sales tax. The developers expect to sell securities backed by the flow of captured TIF taxes to other investors.
Major private investors assembled for the hotel announcement said the time was right to attract private money to the deal.
“Lots of capital now is coming off the bond markets,” said Tim O'Byrne, a lead investor with KC Hospitality Investors LLC, a group of equity investors formed for the Kansas City hotel project. “Lots of money is coming into these higher-yield real estate deals, so the time is right.”
A year and a half ago, “we couldn't have done this,” O'Byrne said, but “the financial markets have really changed.”
O'Byrne is with Inland Pacific Companies, a real estate investment company that specializes in the hospitality industry. Their primary partner in KC Hospitality Investors is Steven C. Rattner, a New York financier formerly with Credit Suisse and DLJ Merchant Bankers.
Planners said Rattner was unable to make the Monday morning event in Kansas City because their flight from New York was canceled.
O'Byrne said Monday that four or five other persons might join the investment team, which is still being assembled.
James, Swerdling, Burke and O'Byrne were among a crowd of civic leaders at the official unveiling of the Hyatt plan, held in the Grand Ballroom's foyer overlooking the intended hotel site.
In the crowd were some who expressed concern about any public participation in the hotel project.
“The Power & Light District is exactly the concern — that we limit our exposure to the taxes generated on the project,” said City Councilman Ed Ford, in reference to 2006, when the city guaranteed the debt on $295 million in bonds issued to help build the downtown entertainment district. District sales tax receipts have covered only about one-fourth of the annual debt service, and the city has been covering the rest out of the general fund.
Former City Cuncilman Dan Cofran said in an email that they prefer taxpayer funds to be used for “needs” such as public safety and infrastructure improvements rather than “wants.” They also addressed the intended use of tourism tax funds to satisfy the proposed city share of the hotel financing.
The development team has said about $2 million a year in tourism tax funds are being used to pay down Kemper Arena expansion bonds. That debt is due to be paid off in early 2016, allowing a rollover from the Kemper use to the Hyatt use. But Cofran said those payments have been coming mostly from the city's general fund rather than the tourism fund.
“Since 2004, there have been $25 million in total bond payments, but $20 million from the General Fund and only $5 million from the Tourism and Convention Fund and other sources,” they said.
Another voice against public financing came from Patrick Tuohey, a Kansas City field manager for the Show-Me Institute, a think tank that advocates for low taxes.
“They can say the city is not on the hook if the hotel underperforms.” Tuohey said. “Technically, we're not on the hook for the Truman Sport Complex or the Citadel project (a faltered urban renewal plan), but we still give them money. If it doesn't make economic sense to build a convention hotel downtown with private funds, well, we've been burned in the past.”
Bob Mayer, a long-time participant in Kansas City economic development efforts, also noted that public participation in any single hotel deal could be disadvantageous to other hotel operators or developers who work with totally private funds.
A Hyatt hotel official at the event said they were not authorized to speak publicly at this time. But developers provided a prepared statement that said Hyatt was delighted to return to Kansas City. Hyatt had operated one of two Crown Center hotels before the hotel was rebranded in 2011 as a Sheraton, a sister Starwood operation to the nearby Westin Crown Center.
One resident who seized on Hyatt's return to the Kansas City market was Sol Koenigsberg, who came to the announcement event to seek a $125,000 donation to the Skywalk Memorial Foundation from Hyatt. Hyatt operated the Crown Center hotel when Koenigsberg was among hundreds injured or killed in the 1981 collapse of lobby walkways.
One pot sweetener in the proposed deal would grant Hyatt exclusive catering rights for 15 years for events held in the Grand Ballroom across the street from the new hotel. Eight area caterers, including the Marriott, which is downtown's other major convention-center hotel, now do business at Grand Ballroom events, and some of them are unhappy with that aspect of the deal, the developers acknowledged.
The hotel tower and accompanying parking garage are planned for the city block bordered by Wyandotte Street on the west, the freeway loop (Truman Road) on the north, 16th Street on the south, and Baltimore Avenue on the east. The city already owns three-fourths of the property, which is used for surface parking.
Developers are negotiating with the American Hereford Association, which occupies the only building on the site. It would be razed for the project to proceed.
Among those at the formal announcement were James and Kansas City City Manager Troy Schulte, who have been working on the hotel project with Burke for nearly three years.
The mayor acknowledged the planning participation of Mayor Pro Tem Cindy Circo; Jackson County Executive Mike Sanders; Economic Development Corp. CEO Bob Langenkamp; Polsinelli attorney Roxsen Koch; Kansas City Finance Director Randy Landes; Oscar McGaskey, the city's director of convention facilities; representatives of JE Dunn Construction and HNTB Architecture; and Visit KC CEO Ronnie Burt.
“Game on,” Burt said. “Step two is putting the shovel in the ground.”
Burt said the city's convention marketing team will begin immediately to put the planned hotel in its marketing tool kit.
The developers hope to begin construction early next year and open the hotel in 2018.
Also cited for their involvement were a communications team from Trozzolo, which handles publicity on the project; Ruben Rodriguez, with Roder Levett Bucknall, representing the developers as construction manager; and Brenda Tinnen, current chairperson of Visit KC and general manager of the Sprint Center.
Design plans still in process call for a hotel tower of perhaps 30 stories and a parking garage of 450 to 500 spaces. The facility is to include ballrooms, meeting rooms, a health facility, a restaurant and other retail.
“Job creation is key,” said Jermaine Reed, 3rd District councilman in Kansas City. “I want to make sure minorities are being hired on the front end, as it relates to construction, but then on the back end when it's opened … in a number of capacities, not just cleaning the rooms.”
Most response at the unveiling was positive. James said “persistent patience has paid off” and the Hyatt will be a “rising tide that lifts all the boats,” including convention and tourism activity throughout downtown and at 18th & Vine, Crown Center and the street car corridor to the Country Club Plaza.
City Councilwoman Jan Marcason said, “I think they've come up with a really workable financing plan. We're getting a little bit smarter. With the Power & Light there was a real burning need to jump-start something. Now I think we're in a much better position to add to our current successes.”

The US Central Intelligence Agency is expected to be one of the key institutions to face major reform by President-elect Donald Trump. Not discounting the fact that such reforms are long overdue, Russian intelligence experts warn that a serious conflict between Trump and the CIA is now all but inevitable.
Since Trump's unexpected victory on Tuesday, a number of statements have already been made by anonymous intelligence officials expressing their 'concern' about the prospects for their agencies under a Trump administration.

Concerns include the President-elect's supposed lack of experience in dealing with classified information, and fears that they may use secret information in an "unreasonable" manner.
Such fears were made public just as Trump was expected to start receiving daily intelligence briefings. However, as the Russian online newspaper Vzglyad pointed out, Trump had begun familiarizing themselves with such information going back to late August.
Accordingly, the paper suggested that this "burst of emotion" among intelligence officials is based more on concerns over the fate of their agencies and positions than it is on the nation's secrets being transferred to Trump's inexperienced hands. And this is particularly true of the CIA.
"The new administration seems set on not only replacing the director of the CIA, but conducting deep reform of the entire intelligence system, which could entail dismissals and a change in the style of the agency's work; and there's no guarantee that the changes will be to the CIA's advantage," Vzglyad contributor Evgeny Krutikov pointed out.
In fact, the journalist suggested, "it's clear that in for the near future, the work of the agency will face a state of disorientation and near-paralysis." This is connected in large part to Trump's dilemma about choosing a new CIA director.
At the moment, Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is rumored to be the only candidate for the post, which is significant, according to Vzglyad, because many of the other key administration posts have upwards of three or four candidates.
© AFP 2018 / Mary Schwalm Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani smiles as they take the stage to speak before Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at an event on October 15, 2016 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire
"Giuliani has a very particular experience with the intelligence community: their participation in the special committee to investigate the 9/11 terrorist attacks ended in scandal. Specifically, the mayor accused the CIA and the FBI of 'excessive secrecy'; the details remain a secret, but most likely came down to the CIA not wanting to disclose their sources with the civilian administration of the city of New York at the end of its term. Their refusal to cooperate provoked a wave of criticism, in which Giuliani themselves was actively involved."
Accordingly, the paper suggested that Giuliani's appointment as CIA director would almost guarantee immediate conflict, since it would reopen old wounds. In any case, the fact that Giuliani is also rumored to be considered for the post of attorney general, where they have considerably more experience, leaves an open question about which post they will actually assume.
At the same time, Vzglyad recalled that that Giuliani has repeatedly demonstrated a tendency toward extreme hawkishness in foreign policy. In recent years, for instance, they openly called on the Obama administration to wage a war against Iran. "If under their watch the CIA begins a hunt across the globe for 'the killers of Americans'…the agency will quickly turn into an office for organizing subversive operations – that is, a return to the fiery days of the 1960s and 70s."
Having said that, the paper also noted that "if President-elect Trump wants to shake up the entire US intelligence system from top to bottom, Giuliani would make a perfect fit. They look at the 'intelligence bureaucracy' – a whole layer of career administrators, with disdain, as a group which parasitically takes advantage of the closed nature of the intelligence system. Of course, in the short term, reform Giuliani-style would paralyze the agency, which already isn't in the best shape."
However, if the new director's tenure starts off with a series of mass layoffs and demotions, this could result in a whole army of disaffected former spies who could go on to sell US secrets to its enemies. "An aggrieved professional, like a veteran who has been passed up, is the most terrible weapon in the intelligence war," Vzglyad stressed.
Effectively, the paper suggested that whatever they end up doing, Trump faces a paradox: "either they will have to whip the agency into submission, imposing new rules of the game, or guarantee themselves an army of potential saboteurs in their backyard."
Vzglyad recalled that "formally, the CIA had declared its neutrality during the election campaign. At the same time, someone had [secretly] accompanied [Trump adviser] Carter Page during their trip to Moscow, and then handed the story to the American press. At the same time, the CIA has a very well-developed instinct for self-preservation, and sees in Trump an irrational threat to their well-being, which will be transmitted whoever they appoint."
"In this sense," the paper emphasized, "the second potential candidate for the post of CIA director, Lieutenant-General Michael Flynn, is no better" as far as established interests are concerned. Flynn worked in intelligence practically all their life, but in the military, topping off their career as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, a post they held from 2012-2014. It doesn't help matters that the worlds of the CIA and US military intelligence have a history of conflict.

Vzglyad noted that Flynn, if appointed, probably wouldn't revert to any drastic or emotion-driven changes, like Giuliani, "but would be likely to refocus the agency toward different objectives. Flynn, as in the good old days of the Cold War, will be interested primarily in the practical, military component of intelligence collection."
"The CIA, despite its inertia, would gradually shift toward the collection of 'technical' information – the number of troops, tactical and technical information regarding weapons systems, the dislocation of military formations and command posts, and other things of the sort collected by other intelligence services of the world in a routine manner. Political and strategic intelligence is not Flynn's profession."
For this reason, the paper suggested that "Flynn would probably look much more at home in the post of Secretary of Defense. They at least knows this area, unlike current Secretary and Oxford professor Ashton Carter – a theoretical physicist who sees the army as a combination of circles and arrows, or in the best case, as a chessboard."
Ultimately, both candidates appear to be a threat to the CIA establishment, according to Vzglyad. "A reduction in funding, [along with] the isolationist theme of the new administration will complete the picture of an agency in decline."
However, a change in CIA guidelines could also prove very useful in the long term. "An updated CIA will almost certainly strengthen its work in Latin America…Support for Israel will be strengthened, which can have mixed long-term consequences. Work will inevitably intensify on China and Japan (Tokyo, incidentally, has long ceased to be regarded as an a priori true ally of the United States)."
In any case, hostility to Trump as an outsider and non-ideologue will be likely to create instability, although the agency's daily work will continue. "CIA stations will continue to work as they have, so long as they do not get tangled up by new instructions and circumstances. It's necessary to understand that the activity of the CIA is extremely bureaucratic…At the mundane level, the system operates autonomously, and fails only when instructions and ideological postulates contradict one another."

At the same, Vzglyad stressed that the CIA will have to get back to doing more field work, an area severely depleted in an era of near total dependence on electronic and cyber-intelligence.
"The bottom line," the newspaper noted, "is that even just the replacement of top officials at the top of the CIA, the NSA and the military will lead to a temporary reduction in their external activity, given the severe internal conflicts and infighting that will arise. All of this will of course require paying close attention and collecting the facts. But it is already clear that this kind of shakeup is one the intelligence community has not faced even in principle."

On this installment of ST, we preview a new exhibition that will soon open at the Gilcrease Museum here in Tulsa; "Alexandre Hogue: An American Visionary -- Paintings and Works on Paper" will be on view at Gilcrease from August 24th through November 30th. Mainly known for their "Dust Bowl" or "Erosion Series" of Depression-era paintings, Alexandre Hogue (1898-1994) was one of the more celebrated artists to come to prominence during the Regionalist movement in American art (which also saw the rise of such masters as Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood). Hogue had a long and varied career as both an artist and art teacher -- in Dallas, New Mexico, New York City, West Texas, and elsewhere -- and they also helped to establish the School of Art here at The University of Tulsa, where they taught for many years. Our guest is Susie Kalil, the co-curator of this exciting new Hogue exhibit at Gilcrease. Kalil also curated a larger version of this show -- and wrote a detailed monograph in connection with it -- and we spoke with them in 2011, when that expanded version of "Alexandre Hogue: An American Visionary -- Paintings and Works on Paper" was on view in Ft. Worth. (Note that you can learn more about the new Hogue show at Gilcrease at this link.)
Riot has updated their Global Contract Database to include Echo Fox and Team ROCCAT's full rosters for the upcoming 2017 Spring Split.
Former Phoenix1 support Austin "Gate" Yu is listed on the database as being signed to a two year deal with Echo Fox, with a contract that is set to expire on Nov. 19, 2018, the longest contract of all players signed to Echo Fox. Joining Gate on the team will be jungler Matthew "Akaadian" Higginbotham, who last played for Dream Team in the 2016 NA CS Summer Split. Akaadian's contract expires on Nov. 20, 2017.
As for Team ROCCAT, the database lists AD carry Petter "Hjarnan" Freyschuss and Support Kim "Wadid" Bae-in as new members of the team. Hjarnan last played with Team Vitality during the 2016 EU LCS Spring Split, while Wadid played for Korean Challenger team RisingStar Gaming. All five members of Team ROCCAT are signed to contracts that expire on Nov. 20, 2017.
Both acquisitions were previously reported by ESPN's Jacob Wolf, with the report on Echo Fox coming Dec. 2 and the report on Team ROCCAT coming Dec. 23.
Both ROCCAT and Echo Fox have seen serious roster overhauls since the end of the summer split, and are both only keeping one member from their old rosters in the new year. Henrik "Froggen" Hansen will be the only remaining member of Echo Fox on the new roster, while Felix "Betsy" Edling will fill the same role on ROCCAT.

“Obama Abortion” discussions explore prolife and prochoice debates with regard to arguments surrounding ObamaCare and funding of abortions.
(Newswire.net -- December 31, 2013) Boston, MA -- ObamaCare and its myriad of complexities has spilled over to the hotly contested abortion sector, sparking pressure on prolife and prochoice agendas. Recently, Michigan joined other states – 24 to be exact – in banning abortion in ObamaCare plans, based on a passed legislative bill that won by “sizable margins.” Among the many that have been outspoken about this issue, Nancy Pelosi has been seeking to amend the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (PPACA) by prohibiting federal funds from being used to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion services. In any case, it is clear the prolife and prochoice debates with regard to arguments over ObamaCare and funding of abortions have made themselves known.
Federal law has prohibited taxpayer-financed abortion, addressed in a compromise that opened the door for the final acceptance of President Barack Obama's health law. Still, many following the controversy have been considering whether or not the topic of abortion is at the root of what is being called the “ObamaCare chaos,” routinely citing the fact that the President continuously stressed that “if [Americans] liked their insurance, they could keep their insurance.” It is also believed by some groups that despite a “caring” empathetic approach, abortion rights may be the reason why since October 1 even those with advanced-stage cancer have had their health insurance plans canceled.
The Affordable Care Act allows states to ban abortion coverage (http://www.teenbreaks.com/abortion/abortionhome.cfm) in the exchanges – regardless of the fact that the state may be running its own exchange – and most of the GOP-led states have interestingly done so. Those who have voiced an opposition to Obama's stance on abortion routinely refer to their health care plan as a “train wreck” that began “hurtling off the tracks” when it was noted that Obama and their cabinet remained “disproportionately focused” on birth control and abortion. Some of this group goes so far as to call this approach “Obama's war on women” with a “victim list” that includes individuals such as California-based Edie Litterfield Sundby, who suffers from stage IV gallbladder cancer.
Still, these sweeping bans across the country are hardly surprising to many, considering that states have passed record numbers of abortion restrictions in past recent years. While a great number of activists opposed federal funding of abortion have been unhappy with the health law compromise, it has become accepted that if a woman desires abortion coverage they are required to pay a separate premium with no federal subsidies. This concession, as it has become known, was enough to convince a number of anti-abortion Democrats – notably then-Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan – to lend “crucially needed” votes to pass the health care law; but the law also allows states to directly ban abortion coverage. This is an element anti-abortion activists point to as “evidence that lawmakers knew it didn't go far enough in making sure federal funds aren't used to pay for abortions.”
A venerable flood of bans has frustrated abortion rights activists who claim the Affordable Care Act does enough to “ensure federal funds aren't used for abortions.” But anti-abortion activists claim lawmakers are simply ensuring that abortion restrictions apply equally to all federally-subsidized insurance plans. As Chuck Donovan, president of the Susan B. Anthony List Education Fund, summarized it: “Those states view it as aligning their policies for the poor with their participation in other kinds of tax benefits with respect to abortion coverage.”
Chris Davies, a Liberal Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the North-West of the UK, is a member of the Budget Control Committee of the European Parliament. As they told BBC's Today Programme (listen here), they discovered, quite by chance, that Parliament's auditors had made a report detailing abuses on a vast scale, abuses that suggest some MEPs are simply plundering the system to enrich themselves.
Notwithstanding that they are a member of the Budget Control Committee, Mr. Davies was only allowed to see the report on condition that they signed all sorts of confidentiality agreements, read the report in a sealed “secret room”, protected by biometric locks and security guards and neither made a copy of nor took notes of the report.
Mr. Davies said the report contained accounts of abuse – let's call a spade a spade here and call it theft and fraud – on a truly shocking scale. Though individuals were not named they made it clear that the extent of the embezzlement and fraud was on such a scale that it could only be met with condign prison sentences for some of those engaged in such practices.
OLAF, the EU Fraud Squad, had not yet heard of this report which makes one wonder if attempts are being made to bury it so as not to rock the boat and to conceal from the European people the extent to which MEPs are looting the public purse for their own enrichment.
Davies made a number of politically rather incorrect statements about where they reckon the worst offenders come from and it is not from the UK, Scandinavia, The Netherlands.
So widespread is the abuse that the AVERAGE amount being nicked is £125,000 ($245,000, €166,000) for each one of the Parliament's 785 MEPs. So bad is the situation that Hans-Gert Pöttering, its president, and a group of senior MEPs are desperately trying to find ways to ensure that there was no “collateral damage” from the report (which presumably means trying to ensure that their heads do not roll as a result of their failure to act in the matter which would thus have the effect of removing them from the gravy train). The excuse being given for this exercise is laughable:
“We want reform but we cannot make this report available to the public if we want people to vote in the European elections next year.”
Some might think that publication would actually increase turnout at these elections when the people of Europe realise just why all these largely Europhile MEPs love the European Union and its Parliament so much. Perhaps then they might turn to some more Eurosceptic politicians of their own, less inclined to view the European Parliament as a milch cow upon whose hind teat they can fasten. That, one suspects, is what the source really meant: “We are frightened for our own place on the gravy train”.
Even more laughable is the explanation that the document is not being kept secret as such, merely confidential, a circumlocution that is both worthy of Sir Humphrey Appleby of Yes Minister and Orwellian:
“The document is not secret. It is confidential. It can be read by Euro-MPs on the budget control committee, in the secret room but not generally. That is not the same as a secret document nobody can read.”
So that is all right then.
What is clear, though, is that the public interest demands that this document be published forthwith so that the people who pay for all this, Europe's Taxpayers, can see what is going on.

About
Decades of research on a novel project to replace the inefficient Piston Engines (Diesel, 4-Stroke, 2-Stroke, etc) and to incorporate all desirable features identified by modern technology produced a design that was granted a US Patent # US 8,056,527.
All Piston Engines and most of the Rotary type use different versions of the same basic mechanism to compress air, necessary to burn the combustible and to extract power from the expanding burnt mixture.
The motion (stroke) to compress air is equal to the stroke to produce power. That means that a 4-stroke engine having a compression ratio (CR) of 8 to 1 will generate 120 PSI at top dead center and 800 PSI after ignition, but can only use pressure to generate power down to 100 PSI, for the Expansion stroke is equal to the Compression stroke.
That means that hot gases are discharged into the atmosphere at 100 PSI. There is a lot of energy left. How much? Enough to power every air tool in a shop or industry! Think of the pollution it generates, specially in stop & go traffic conditions.
Our engine has independent mechanisms for compressing air and generating power, thus doing away with all problems of Piston Engines.
Here are some of the features of the LUCAS ENGINE:
1) High Torque. As much as six (6) times that of an equivalent 4cyl 4-stroke conventional engine.
2) Variable Compression Ratio. Compresses just the amount of air necessary to completely burn the fuel. No wasted energy.
3) Near ideal Air/Fuel ratio burns clean through all speeds.
4) It expands the burnt mixture all the way to atmosphere. Highly efficient. Produces more power with the same fuel used.
5) It develops more or less power to match demand by varying the number of explosions per cycle, eliminating the need for a GEARBOX.
6) It reduces emissions throughout the operating range, but specially in the idling mode. The reduction there can reach 97.5%.
7) It produces minimal quantities of Nitrous Oxides (NOx) because it operates with near ideal Air/Fuel conditions even during idling.
8) It is cheaper to make because it has less and simpler parts.
9) It is much lighter than a comparable engine and power train. Remember: it does not need a GEARBOX.
10) Less weight also improves economy, for less power is needed to operate a lighter car.
A size comparison chart depicting a sample of Martian wildlife from the Flea War universe. This image was inspired by ~M0AI's fantastic scale chart of various prehistoric organisms ( [link] ), and their same disclaimers apply: the silhouettes are all based on photos and drawings found on the Web, scale may not be exact, etc. etc.In this universe, the Martian ecosystem is artificial, having been seeded for unknown reasons by the vanished Overculture. It is a very limited and primitive ecology with its foundation in chemosynthetic, anaerobic bacteria feeding on the metals and minerals in the Martian rocks and soil. These bacteria are in turn consumed by "sand plankton" ranging in size from microscopic to several centimeters in length. The megafauna consists of burrowing and surface-dwelling filter-feeders preying on the sand plankton, with a very few top predators possibly feeding on the "grazers."To reflect the proper order of the food chain, descriptions read from bottom to top.BOTTOM ROW: Resembling terrestrial amphipods, these burrowing and surface-level filter-feeders are the most tractable and least aggressive of the Martian megafauna. They are often found in fairly sizable aggregations, scuttling over rocks and burrowing through the soil in search of sufficient nutrients to support their largely anaerobic metabolisms. While not territorial or aggressive, they do have the unpredictable (and disconcerting) tendency to "swarm" over human mecha in response to the machines' heat and metallicity (these factors recalling the most "appetizing" traits of their own food source).MIDDLE ROW: Large, solitary surface grazers of the Martian desert. At this level of the food chain, organisms require large tracts of grazing area to support their metabolisms and have established feeding grounds. These creatures are not predatory at the macroscopic scale, but can be quite aggressive in defense of their nutrient-poor territories. They read the heat and metal content of human machines as indicating living rivals for their food source, and will very often attack out of territorial instinct.TOP ROW: Top predators of the Martian food chain. Although their life cycles remain largely unknown, these creatures appear to feed on the "bottom-row" grazers as well as on the ubiquitous "sand plankton." Like the mid-level grazers, they range over vast tracts of open desert and ferociously defend their territories from intruders and rivals. They possess the most aerobic metabolisms of the Martian megafauna and will attack human mecha on sight, seeing them not only as a territorial threat but as a potential source of the metal and oxygen compounds needed to supplement their nutrient-poor diet.Each tic mark represents 1 meter, with the human figure standing 2 meters tall.

Police have had to intervene to protect Italy's Roma community Human rights group Amnesty International has said it is extremely alarmed by what it calls a "climate of discrimination" in Italy. The Italian section of the rights body said recent tough new immigration measures were a worrying trend. It added that politicians from both sides of the spectrum were legitimising the use of racist language. Last week, Italy's new centre-right government introduced a series of measures aimed at improving security. Illegal immigration will become punishable by up to four years in prison, it will be easier to expel illegal immigrants and there will be a three-year prison sentence for using minors to beg for money. Attacks on Roma But the head of Amnesty International in Italy, Daniela Carboni, said the moves represented "heavy restrictions and new crimes that will target, above all, immigrants". They said the organisation was particularly worried by the measure that would mean attempted illegal immigrants could be held for up to 18 months in a detention centre. "Amnesty International is extremely alarmed both by the contents and haste of these measures... and by the climate of discrimination which preceded them," Ms Carboni said in the report. 2007 was characterised by the impotence of Western governments
Amnesty International annual report World 'failing on human rights'
There is deep suspicion throughout the country of the Roma community, whom many Italians blame for a disproportionate amount of crime. In mid-May Italian police were forced to intervene to protect Roma Gypsies who came under attack from local residents in Naples, who set their camps alight. Ms Carboni urged the Italian government to investigate fully the torching of the two Roma slum communities. In April's national elections the centre-right coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi - which includes the anti-immigration Northern League and the post-Fascist Alleanza Nazionale - swept to victory, pledging to tackle illegal immigration. In Rome, Gianni Alemanno, also of the Alleanza Nazionale, was elected mayor on a pledge to expel 20,000 people.

• Attack happened during AFC Champions League game • ‘Such behavior shall never be tolerated,' say Al-Nassr
The former Uruguay international Fabián Estoyanoff has been fined half of their salary by Saudi club Al-Nassr after attacking the South Korean Nam Tae-hee following their 3-1 home defeat in the AFC Champions League on Tuesday.
The loss to Qatari champions Lekhwiya meant the Saudis missed out on the knockout stages of the continental tournament. Estoyanoff could be seen chasing after attacking playmaker Nam, who scored the second and won a penalty for the third goal, down the tunnel.
The South American grabbed Nam from behind and threw a number of punches before being dragged away. The South Korean appeared stunned and held their face after the incident.
“50% will be deducted from Fabián Estoyanoff's salary until the end of the season due to assaulting a player from the guest team,” Al-Nassr posted on Twitter.
“Such behavior shall never be tolerated. It doesn't represent the good moral & sportsmanship of #ALNASSR players, staff, or fans.”
Estoyanoff, 32, could also face further sanctions from the Asian Football Confederation for the incident, which was captured on television.
One of the contested P2P cases we've been following is Atlantic Records v. Jeffery Howell, which is being heard in a federal court in Phoenix. Howell and their wife have been representing themselves so far, but are going to get a bit of high-profile help tomorrow. EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann is going to appear at a hearing tomorrow to argue that the mere presence of music in a KaZaA share is not enough to constitute copyright infringement.
The Howells were originally sued in 2006. In their original response to the RIAA's complaint, they argued that KaZaA was "not set up to share" and that the files flagged by MediaSentry were "for private use" and "for transfer to portable devices, that is legal for 'fair use.'"
In August of last year, Judge Neil V. Wake granted the RIAA's motion for summary judgment, awarding the labels $40,500 in statutory damages and $350 in court costs. The Howells appealed the ruling, saying that they were "unaware" that their "personal files" were being shared over KaZaA, and in late September, Judge Wake vacated the summary judgment.
Von Lohmann's appearance in court tomorrow will be in support of a brief filed by the EFF in January. In the filing, the EFF argued that the mere fact that songs were made available for download in a shared folder does not constitute copyright infringement. The only downloading that anyone can demonstrate was done by MediaSentry with the RIAA's explicit authorization and permission, which the public interest group argues does not constitute copyright infringement.
The "making available" argument is one that keeps resurfacing in contested cases, and was one of the factors in the Jammie Thomas trial. The judge presiding over that case told the jury that the labels did not have to prove that anyone downloaded any files from Thomas—the mere fact that they were in a KaZaA share was sufficient to constitute copyright infringement.
Von Lohmann will argue against that reading of US copyright law in their appearance tomorrow. Since the Copyright Act specifically authorizes copyright owners to control copies distributed "to the public," there needs to be evidence that said distribution actually took place. "Where the only evidence of infringing distribution consists of distributions to authorized agents of the copyright owner, that evidence cannot, by itself, establish that other, unauthorized distributions have taken place," reads the EFF's brief.
The EFF has math on its side: with over 2.2 million KaZaA users online when MediaSentry downloaded the files, the group believes it's highly unlikely that anyone would have grabbed the 11 songs in question, as they were popular songs and available from thousands of other users on KaZaA.
The fact that Judge Wake is hearing arguments on this issue is significant. If they rule that the record labels have to show that someone aside from MediaSentry downloaded the files in order to prove infringement, it could prove to be a serious setback for the RIAA's legal campaign. At the very least, it would move Atlantic v. Howell further in the direction of a trial.

Torah is G‑d's wisdom. Intellect, by its very nature, allows for – and indeed demands – different avenues of understanding; how much more so when dealing with the infinite wisdom of the Infinite G‑d.
Our sages tell us that Torah can be interpreted in four different general ways: peshat, remez, drush and sod.
1) Peshat is the simple interpretation of the Torah. When the verse says (Genesis 1:1) that "In the beginning G‑d created the Heaven and Earth," it means exactly what it seems to mean, in a very literal sense.
Within these four methods of understanding Torah, there exist countless possible avenues of understanding2) Remez is the different hints and allusions which are contained within the Torah. One of the methodologies the Torah employs to make these hints is gematryia, the numerical value of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. For example, the gematriya of "Bereshit bara" ("In the beginning They created)" is the same as "b'Rosh Hashanah nivra ha'olam" (on Rosh Hashanah the world was created)!"
Bereshit bara and b'Rosh Hashanah nivra are both 1116.
3) Drush (or Midrash) expounds upon the deeper meaning of the verse. The Hebrew word for "In the beginning" is bereshit. The midrash tells us that this word can be split into two words—b reshit. The Torah is telling us that the world was created for two ("b") "reshit"s ("firsts")—the Jews and the Torah. Although this is not the simple interpretation of the word, nevertheless it is a true and valid way of understanding the Torah.
4) Sod (secret) is the esoteric, mystical part of Torah. The Tikkunei Zohar (a book which gives seventy (!) different esoteric explanations for the word bereshit) explains that the word bereshit can also be split into "bara shis" (created [with] six). This is because the world was created through G‑d's six emotional powers: kindness, severity, beauty, victory, splendor and foundation.
Within these four methods of understanding Torah, there exist countless possible avenues of understanding. For example: There are many different ways to understand the Torah according to Peshat. That's why there are many Torah commentators who concentrate on Peshat — Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam and many more – and they will very often (it seems, more often than not...) disagree on the literal meaning of a verse. In fact, according to Kabbalastic teachings there are 600,000 ways to understand Peshat, 600,000 ways to understand Remez, 600,000 ways to understand Drush, and 600,000 ways to understand Sod!
Any insight in Torah is acceptable as long as it (makes sense and) does not contradict any of our fundamental beliefs.
Our sages tell us that "any chiddush (novel idea) which a reputable disciple will ever come up with was already given to Moses by Sinai." Moses might not have heard this specific idea which the rabbi living thousands of years later has just thought of, but the basis of this idea was already given by Sinai.
G‑d gave us the tools to delve into the words of Torah and reveal the divine wisdom hidden therein.
When it comes to the halachah, however, there is only one truth. For whereas Torah is G‑d's wisdom which, as abovementioned, allows for different opinions, halachah is (not intellect, but rather) G‑d's will. And will is absolute, and does not allow for two ways to look at things.
Homosexuals constitute a tiny fragment of the population, and in a morally degenerating culture, have very little to complain about. Why is their agenda suddenly such an urgent priority for the leftists running the government and media? Because as community organizers like to say, the issue is never the issue. The “gay rights” jihad isn't about perverted sexual practices; it is about the power to impose an ideology by government force. It is also about crushing Christianity, a traditional bulwark against the tyranny of statism. For example, San Antonio bureauweenies have proposed a new ordinance:
“No person shall be appointed to a position if the city council finds that such person has, prior to such proposed appointment, engaged in discrimination or demonstrated a bias, by word or deed, against any person, group or organization on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, age or disability.”
This means that no one who stands accused of ever having failed to revere homosexuality can hold public office or get a city contract in San Antonio, the nation's seventh largest city. Among the ramifications:
Critics argue that the ordinance could ban Christians who believe homosexuality is a sin from serving on the city council. They also believe the ordinance would also ban the city from doing business with anyone who fails to espouse politically correct views and businesses run by people of faith would be subject to criminal penalties if they refused to provide services that conflict with their religious beliefs related to homosexuality.
As Ken Klukowski of the Family Research Council observes,
“If it's passed, any person who has either expressed any belief in favor of traditional marriage or in terms of Judeo-Christian morality regarding sexuality in general, verbally or in writing, could be barred from participating in public life on that city council.”
This totalitarian viewpoint discrimination is being pushed by Mayor Julian Castro and Councilkook Diego Bernal.
San Antonio is famous as the home of the Alamo, where legendary heroes William Travis, Davy Crockett, and Jim Bowie fought to the death for American values against the Mexican tyrant Santa Anna. Where are the heroes to defend freedom now?
Forgotten.

Police conducted a ‘major operation' in the aftermath of Tonga's loss to England in the RLWC. Jamie Wall was there, and reports on what many in the community felt like overkill.
Last night, in the wake of Tonga's 20-18 loss to England in the Rugby League World Cup, thousands of locals took to the streets of the Otāhuhu town centre to celebrate Tonga's dream run in the tournament. The crowd flowed from the game at Mt Smart to the suburb, where a long procession of cars and flag waving fans creating a noisy and joyous atmosphere.
At the same time, police responded to the fan turnout with what they characterise as a ‘major operation' in the south Auckland suburb. Members of the public have reacted strongly to what they've described as a heavy-handed approach by the police. Many have complained of an intimidating atmosphere in which police ripped and broke flags, some being waved by children.
We witnessed this @nzpolice man aggressively grab 2 #Tongan flags out the hands of the occupants of this moving car, then snap the flag poles & walk off. When confronted for an explanation, they signalled to 3 more officers to talk to the occupants. Disgusting. #Ōtāhuhu pic.twitter.com/zmqgeSxkJC — The Emazonian™ (@ColourMeFiji) November 25, 2017
In a Friday press release, Inspector Wendy Spiller of the Counties-Manukau Police said: “We will have a significant police presence in the area and will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to any behaviour which puts members of our community or our staff in danger.”
For many in the community the large police presence felt oppressive, and described actions which they felt rested on negative assumptions about the revellers based on their ethnicity.
My 15 year old daughter just got their flagpole taken off them by the police because said it might be used as a weapon . I'm furious this racist heavy handed policing had killed off the community coming out to celebrate together #otahuhu #mmt pic.twitter.com/BPmyAmkYRl — Uriohau (@uriohau) November 25, 2017
Papatoetoe resident Ema Tavola was in Otāhuhu last night, and described the atmosphere as “something I had really been looking forward to, to see my community in such a happy state.” They were alarmed at the large police presence.
“It felt like they were in a riot mode. They definitely wanted their presence to be felt in a really assertive way. Their presence was aggressive and didn't feel like they were there to support the energy, which was really disappointing.”
Cultural hegemony being exercised by mainstream media and the NZ Police during Tongans celebrating their huge success #RLWC17.
What the hell is wrong with you people??? ???? — Ria Hall (@RiaHallNZ) November 25, 2017
Others questioned the motivation of the police's actions, with one Twitter user saying that they found it bizarre that the police were confiscating alcohol out of cars driving up Māngere Rd under the guise of public safety, when there were at least eight alcohol outlets open between Otāhuhu and Māngere town centre.
Police say 21 arrests were made throughout the evening following disorder-related offences, and their spokesperson Spiller said this morning the large police presence “was to ensure the safety of the community following last night's league match at Mt Smart Stadium.”
The heavy police presence and subsequent arrests appeared partly caused by the lack of any major planned event. “There was a real lack of foresight,” says Tavola. “They could've closed Great South Road and had a street party – created an alcohol-free area for children, but it was the complete opposite of that.”
I need these Pacific & Māori govt Ministers to step up and condemn the action of police last night following the Tongan game. Shameful, reminescent of the dawn raids, & racial profiling. Not Ok! @JennySalesa @AupitoWSio_MP @CarmelSepuloni @NgatiBird @PeeniHenare @NanaiaMahuta https://t.co/Q7Y36R9Ofb — Brandon (@JusSumWun) November 25, 2017
The aggressive style of policing contrasted markedly with the friendly facilitation of the Lions tour, and the swiftly-planned community events which followed the America's Cup win. Tavola lamented the way they dealt with the crowd's Tongan flags, which had become the enduring image of the tournament.
“The manner in which flags were ripped out of people's hands and broken was a really aggressive way of saying ‘we're in charge'. That's not how you broker safety with a community, that's how you intimidate people.”
Many people have voiced concerns about the portrayal of Tongan and Pacific Island supporters in the media, which they feel has exacerbated the police response.
why you gotta put a child with that headline? why you gotta scaremonger? why you gotta be racist pieces of shit? pic.twitter.com/wgO7PK7e5T — awkward orchid (@awkward_orchid) November 25, 2017
Tavola too linked the police's tactics to the way it was covered in media. “The mainstream media [was] giving Tongans and all Pacific Islanders such a bad rap throughout the whole World Cup – it's a really vulgar state of power and control.”
Several weeks ago, in the aftermath of Tonga's win over New Zealand, a police officer was struck in the face with a flagpole in a disorder incident. Last weekend, a female police officer from Counties Manukau was knocked unconscious.
Earlier this year, though, police seemed to have a very different approach to fans of the British & Irish Lions rugby tour. We contacted Superintendent Sandra Manderson, who replied that “the behaviour from fans during this event has been completely different to the behaviour of Lions fans. We have responded accordingly.”
In the lead up to a Lions test, Wellington Inspector Neil Banks quoted in Stuff as saying:
“Visiting Lions fans and local fans alike have embraced the spirit of what is a very special occasion for New Zealand. We are not expecting to need to make large numbers of arrests.”
Superintendent Manderson was also quoted in the same article, saying: “This has been a really special event for New Zealand, and our staff have really enjoyed engaging with fans at games and around the country and helping them stay safe. It was a pleasure to police.”
During the tour police made 13 arrests for disorder offences – including English prop Kyle Sinckler, a member of the Lions tour party.
Despite the reaction from the Tongan community, Police maintain they merely responded to circumstances as they presented themselves. “We have made significant efforts to engage with the Pasifika community ahead of this event and during, and feel confident our relationships within the community remain strong.”
Tavola echoes the feelings of a number of people within the community in sounding unconvinced. “Their version of safety and the community's version of safety are two different things.”

Hours after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's Twitter account was hacked, the party's official account was also found to be hacked. Abusive tweets were posted on the Congress's account @INCIndia earlier Thursday although those tweets were removed within 30 minutes. The party's website inc.in was found to be hacked as well.

“It's a huge question mark on the digital security,” Gandhi was quoted saying by news agency ANI.
The Delhi Police has registered an FIR into the hacking of Gandhi's Twitter account on the basis of a complaint filed Wednesday. The police said an investigation has been initiated and are looking at all aspects regarding cyber crime.
WATCH VIDEO: After Rahul Gandhi's Twitter Handle, Congress Official Twitter Account Hacked
Hours after the hacking, in signs that the Congress account has been restored, this tweet was sent out:
Hello everyone! We are back. The tweets in the morning lacked wit, evidently. Anyway, Mr Modi, back to people's questions, care to answer? — INC India (@INCIndia) December 1, 2016
Late Wednesday evening, Gandhi's Twitter account was also found to be hacked similarly though the abusive tweets were taken down hours later. The party called the hacking “unscrupulous, unethical and roguish” and blamed internet trolls for the act. A ‘fascist culture' was behind the act, the Congress said.
READ: Congress calls hacking ‘roguish, unethical'
“Such unscrupulous, unethical and roguish conduct of venal trolls to hack @OfficeOfRG reflects disturbing insecurities of prevalent fascist culture,” party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted immediately afterward. It was not clear which organisation was behind the hacking. The party has filed a complaint with the cyber cell of the Delhi Police over Gandhi's Twitter account being hacked. The matter is also expected to reach both Houses of Parliament in the ongoing winter session as the Congress plans to raise it.

“The social media hack of both the accounts can be a result of any one of the following two possibilities: It can either be a potential backdoor(malware) being present on a computer system on which both the accounts might have been simultaneously accessed or this can be a long persistent and targeted attack – spear phishing in most cases on either the email account that was used to create the twitter handle or directly of the Twitter account – on the political party. In either of the cases I am certain there is more data in the hands of the hackers than just account access that might be released in due course of time,” said Saket Modi, co-founder and CEO of Lucideus, in a statement. Lucideus is a digital security services provider.
“The only two parties responsible for the security of a social media account are the social media provider (in this case Twitter) and the owner of the account. As it's just 2 accounts that have been compromised and misused, it is safe to assume that the exploited vulnerability was not present on the side of Twitter,” the statement read.

While the official Congress Twitter account has 1.38 million followers as of Thursday, @OfficeofRG account is followed by 1.22 million people on the popular micro-blogging platform.
One week after the Syrian Al-Qaeda group “Jabhat Al-Nusra” and their allies from Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham and Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen launched a large-scale offensive in the provincial capital of the Aleppo Governorate, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) has reversed the tide of this battle after repelling the militants at the Al-Khalidiyah District and the Al-Rashideen District inside the city.
On Saturday, the Syrian Arab Army – in coordination with the National Defense Forces (NDF), Kata'eb Al-Ba'ath (Ba'ath Battalions), and Liwaa Al- Quds (Jerusalem Brigades) – conducted a counter-assault on the militants from Jabhat Al-Nusra at the Al-Khalidiyah District, where they successfully recaptured all points that were under the enemy control, including the Sponge Factory.
Following their capture of the imperative Sponge Factory, the Syrian Armed Forces advanced from the Al-Khalidiyah District to the eastern perimeter of Al-Layramoun, where they subsequently captured three building blocks and two strategic factories at the asupervisorstioned district inside the northern sector of the Aleppo Governorate.
Meanwhile, at the western front of Aleppo, the Syrian Armed Forces continued their counter-assault at the Al-Rashideen District and the Al-Zahra Association Quarter, killing 14 enemy combatants from Jabhat Al-Nusra and Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen before they were able to recapture the Great Mosque of Aleppo near the Air Force Intelligence building (Al-Zahra).
North of the city, the militants from Jaysh Al-Mujahiddeen and Jabhat Al-Nusra attacked Bashkoy once again after the asupervisorstioned militants were forced out of the town by the Syrian Armed Forces; however, this time, the assault was repelled by the latter at Tal Al-Afghani on the outskirts of this area near the town of Rityan.

At a Glance Hurricane Katia made landfall on the Veracruz coast in eastern Mexico.
Heavy rainfall and gusty winds occurred in eastern Mexico.
Hurricane Katia made landfall north of Tecolutla, between Tampico and the city of Veracruz, in eastern Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane late Friday night.

Katia quickly dissipated as it tracked inland Saturday morning.
The threat of heavy rainfall will continue into the weekend in eastern Mexico. This heavy rainfall may result in flash flooding and mudslides.
Katia first developed on September 5, 2017 in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and did not move much over the next several days. Katia rapidly strengthened into a hurricane on September 6, 2017.
Maximum sustained winds reached 105 mph on Sept. 8, 2017, making it a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . Fortunately, Katia weakened before making landfall.
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico—The U.S. Army will take over recovery operations in Puerto Rico, Col. Jorge Santini of Puerto Rico's National Guard state command told The Daily Beast. The announcement is expected Thursday afternoon.
U.S. Northern Command appointed Army Brig. Gen. Richard Kim on Wednesday to oversee operations. The Army will oversee every facet of the massive mission and coordinate with the National Guard, FEMA, and Gov. Ricardo Rossello's office, Santini said. Approximately 2,600 U.S. military personnel and Guard members are currently involved in Hurricane Maria relief efforts, the Pentagon said.
"We need more manpower, more resources, more help, quickly and efficiently," Santini said. "We needed to federalize the recovery plan."
Ret. Gen. Russel Honore, who led the military effort in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, told NPR on Thursday morning and far more troops are needed.
“Puerto Rico is a bigger and tougher mission than Katrina,' Honore said, adding 20,000 federal troops and 40,000 National Guard were under their command. Honore said twice as many are needed for Puerto Rico.
“We started moving about four days too late,” Honore said.
Earlier Thursday, President Donald Trump temporarily suspended the Jones Act, a 1920 law that prohibits foreign ships from shuttling goods between U.S. ports. Even without it, San Juan's port filled with 2,000 containers that can't get out of because of a shortage of diesel fuel for trucks and a shortage of drivers.
Meanwhile, the banking system has been paralyzed without electricity. Everyone has been living on cash only. Now the few ATMs have limited withdrawals to $100 down from $500. Banco Popular has offered to give $50 per person in need to get by and said the “loan” will be withdrawn from accounts when things return to normal.
Meanwhile, the airport has been transformed into a refugee camp of stranded tourists bordering nervous breakdowns. Hundreds stand in lines with a hopeful desperate look, while hundreds others stay outside. It's expected some 30 flights will come in on Friday. One man said they had to pay as much $1,500 to get to the States.
Heavy storms are expected this weekend, President Trump will arrive on Tuesday, which will effectively close the airport.
Occasionally, from week to week, a league will go back and adjust the statline in a game. Yu Darvish gives up a hit, or LeBron loses a rebound, or Jamaal Charles loses three yards and everyone in your fantasy league ends up in last place. This is more or less like that, except 20 years after the fact.
A while back, Basketball Reference was told that there was something up with Game 6 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Semifinals. After doing some digging, it turned out that Antonio Davis was getting the short end. Here's how BBRef explained what happened:
It recently came to our attention that there are some conflicting scores listed by various sources for Game 6 of the 1994 Pacers/Hawks Eastern Conference Semifinals series. This prompted some digging here. As a result, we have changed our score, from 97-79, to a 98-79 final. The extra point has been awarded to Antonio Davisfor making 1 of 2 FTA in the 4th quarter. However, this also led to our discovery that some of the "official" playoff totals for the 1993-94 Pacers are not correct. They are "officially" credited with 1,444 points in the 1994 Playoffs, but if you add up all of their scores, you will get 1,445. Similarly, Antonio Davis is "officially" credited with 134 points in the 1994 Playoffs, but if you add up their game logs, you will get 135. It is our belief that the 98th point we were missing from our Game 6 score has gone unaccounted for in NBA stat totals for the last 20 years. As such, we are adjusting the Playoff scoring totals for the 1994 Pacers. The team will now be credited with 1,445 Playoff points (rather than 1,444) and Antonio Davis with 135 Playoff points (rather than 134). Additionally, 1 FTM and 2 FTA have been added to the Pacers' total (all credited to Davis). Thanks to this correction, Davis has moved past Larry Foust for sole possession of 219th place on our NBA all-time Playoff scoring list. Congratulations, Antonio!
Because the point was already in the box score, this isn't a radical shift—it isn't going back to look at the Duncan quadruple-double that wasn't, or prying away some of those 23 Nick Van Exel assists—but this is fun all the same.

General Electric ( GE ), the legendary American institution, founded in 1878 by Thomas Edison, is in deep trouble. Its PR machine has been in constant spin mode as the company sinks deeper into despair. It is one of the few companies in the U.S. that still retains a AAA rating. Considering Moody's and S&P's track record, rating companies and financial instruments, that AAA rating is not worth the paper it is written on. One look at GE's balance sheet will convince you they do not deserve a AAA rating. AAA companies do not need to take the desperate actions that GE has taken in the last few months.

The virtual crash in its stock price indicates that there is something seriously wrong with GE. The stock reached $53 at its peak in 2000. It closed below $17 this past week, the lowest level since the mid-1990s. CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who took over from icon Jack Welch in 2001, has made their mark by managing the company to a 68% decline in its stock price. You will not see anyone on CNBC take a hard look at GE's financial statements or ask the CEO tough questions, because Mr. Immelt signs their paychecks. While shareholders have taken a bath, Mr. Immelt, a Harvard MBA, raked in $72.2 million of compensation between 2002 and 2007. A company that is known for its pay for performance mantra evidently does not hold its CEO to the same standards.
The first signs of cracks in this global institution appeared in April 2008. GE has met their earnings projections consistently for decades. It is widely known that they are masters of “legal” earnings manipulation. Accounting rules allow for wide discretion in reserves and estimates. GE Capital has always been a black box within the larger company. GE does not provide detailed financial information about this division. This lack of detail has allowed GE to use this division as its backstop for meeting earnings estimates. During a better than expected quarter, they take extra reserves and have the quarter meet estimates or beat by one cent. During a down quarter, they use those excess reserves to meet estimates. The GE Capital division would also sell liquid assets at the end of a quarter to guarantee smooth sailing. This earnings management had lulled analysts and stockholders into being complacent regarding GE's business.

In mid-March Mr. Immelt confirmed publicly that GE would meet earnings expectations of $.50 to $.53 per share for the quarter ending March 31. With 2 weeks left in a 12 week quarter, Mr. Immelt was confident in their results. When GE reported earnings of $.44 per share in early April, the world was shocked. The stock, which had reached a yearly high of $37, dropped 16% to $31. Knowing that GE always has excess reserves to manage their earnings, with only two weeks left in the quarter, made the magnitude of the earnings miss beyond belief. Former CEO Jack Welch went on CNBC and said, “I'd be shocked beyond belief, and I'd get a gun out and shoot them if they don't make what they promised now. Here's the screw-up: you made a promise that you'd deliver this, and you missed three weeks later. Jeff has a credibility issue.” Mr. Welch is absolutely right. Jeffrey Immelt has no credibility left. Their excuse was, "We had planned for an environment that was going to be challenging...[but] after the Bear Stearns event, we experienced an extraordinary disruption in our ability to complete asset sales and incurred marks of impairments and this was something that we clearly didn't see until the end of the quarter." A top CEO should have a better handle on theirs business.
The next daggers into Mr. Immelt's credibility occurred in late September and early October. On September 25, with the stock trading at $25.50, Jeff Immelt lowered GE's earnings guidance, suspended its $15 billion stock buyback plan and declared they needed no outside capital. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining a AAA rating with these actions. One week later they convinced Warren Buffett to invest $3 billion in the company by paying them an annual dividend of 10% while granting them warrants to purchase $3 billion of common stock at $22.25. It then sold $12 billion of additional shares at $22.25 to the public. These were not the actions of a company or CEO that is in control. AAA rated companies do not have to pay 10% interest rates. Credit default swaps protecting against GE Capital default traded as if GE is a junk bond credit.
The issuing of $12 billion in common stock at $22.25 per share is an act of extreme desperation and brings into question whether GE has a lucid strategy. How can investors have confidence in a company that bought back 97 million shares for $3.1 billion at an average price of $31.69 in the first nine months of 2008, and then issued $12 billion worth of stock at $22.25 in October? Not only did they buy back $3.1 billion of stock in 2008, but they also bought back $27 billion of stock in the prior three years at an average price of $36.46. This is a twist on the old saying, buy high and sell low. If Mr. Immelt was not so focused on trying to beat short term earnings goals by wasting $30 billion of cash on share buybacks, they wouldn't have had to beg Warren Buffett for $3 billion last month at very poor terms from GE's perspective. A CEO is responsible for preparing their company for the worst case scenario and should never risk the company in an attempt to meet short term goals. Mr. Buffett may have made one of the few mistakes of their glorious investing career. They have lost $762 million on their investment in 1 ½ months, a return of -25%.

Most people know GE as an industrial conglomerate that makes light bulbs, appliances, and jet engines. Their advertising agency has positioned GE as a “green” company with an advertising campaign called “Ecomagination”, stressing wind power, hybrid locomotives, and environmentally friendly products. The truth is that GE should have an ad campaign called “Bankomagination”. GE is a bank disguised as an industrial conglomerate. GE Capital is a division of GE, which truly dominates the results of this company. GE Capital has three subdivisions (GE Commercial Finance, GE Money, and GE Consumer Finance). In 2003, GE Capital generated $5.9 billion of GE's $17 billion of profits, or 35%. By 2007, GE Capital was generating $12.2 billion of their $29 billion of profits, or 42%. Being a bank during the boom years of 2004 to 2007 did wonders for GE's bottom line. Being a bank now is a rocky path to destruction.

GE Capital is enormously leveraged to consumers throughout the world. It issues credit cards for Wal-Mart, Lowe's, IKEA, and hundreds of other retailers throughout the world. GE Capital provides private label credit card programs, installment lending, bankcards and financial services for customers, retailers, manufacturers and health-care providers. It also owns 1,800 commercial airplanes and leases them to 225 airlines worldwide. GE Capital provides credit services to more than 130 million customers — like retailers, consumers, auto dealers and mortgage lenders. Their financial products and services include a suite of offerings, from credit cards to debt consolidation to home equity loans. GE Capital has also been a huge benefit to the industrial side of the business. GE Capital provides financing for customers that buy GE power turbines, jet engines, windmills, locomotives and other big ticket items. The crucial question is whether the people and companies who received loans from GE Capital can pay them back. GE's future is highly dependent on the answer to this question.
The AAA rating of GE allows GE Capital to borrow funds at lower rates than all banks in the United States. Their cost of capital has been 7.3%. Losing that rating would be disastrous to GE Capital. Between 2002 and 2006, GE Capital did what most other banks did and levered up. Their ratio of debt to equity rose from 6.6 to 8.1, while profits quadrupled. GE Capital jumped into the subprime mortgage market in 2004, buying WMC Mortgage. It sold it in 2007, after racking up losses of $1 billion in 2007. It also unloaded a Japanese consumer lending company at a $1.2 billion loss in 2007. It is clear that risk management has taken a back seat to profits at GE Capital. GE Capital's profits plunged 38% in the 3rd quarter, the main reason for GE's earnings miss. Analyst Nicholas Heymann of Sterne Agee wrote: "Investors now understand that GE uses the last couple weeks in the quarter to 'fine-tune' its financial service portfolios to ensure its earnings objectives are achieved. It turns out it really wasn't miracle management systems or risk-control systems or even innovative brilliance. It was the green curtain that allowed the magic to be consistently performed undetected."
Egan-Jones, an independent rating agency, calculates that GE is levered ten-to-one, a more conservative and higher number than the company's eight-to-one figure. Cofounder Sean Egan believes that, depending on the off-balance-sheet holdings, actual leverage could be still higher. Their firm rates the company single-A. Looking at GE's Balance Sheet between 2003 and today, clearly shows a deteriorating situation. Long-term debt grew from $172 billion in 2003 to $381 billion by the 1st quarter of 2008, a 121% increase. Their long term debt to equity ratio grew from 68% to 77%. Short-term debt grew from $157.4 billion in 2003 to $218.7 billion in the latest quarter, a 40% increase. The 70% increase in profits between 2003 and 2007 were undoubtedly juiced by the use of prodigious amounts of debt. Stockholder's equity is at the same level as 2004. With cash of only $59.7 billion and short-term debt of $218.7 billion, the freezing up of the credit markets has put GE at major risk when trying to roll over their debt.

Scholarly discussions on economic development in history, specifically those linked to industrialization or modern economic growth, have paid great attention to the formation and development of the market economy as a set of institutions able to augment people's welfare. The role of nonmarket practices for promoting economic development and success has been an area of interest, typically involving discussion of the state's economic policies. How have societies tackled problems that the market did not handle well? To what extent did their solutions reflect the structure of their economy?
Public Goods Provision in the Early Modern Economy explores these questions by investigating efforts made for the provision of “public goods” in early modern economies from the perspective of Japanese socioeconomic history during the Tokugawa era (1603–1868), and comparing those cases with others from Europe and China. The contributors focus on three areas of inquiry—welfare policies for the poor, infrastructure, and forest management—to provide both a unique perspective on Japanese public finance at local levels and a vantage point outside of Europe. The book seeks to encourage a more global view of the early modern political economies that shaped subsequent modern transformations.
“With new global evidence that goes well beyond the timeworn topics of taxation and military spending, Public Goods Provision will make historians and social scientists rethink the development of fiscal systems, the history of public spending, and the long-run pattern of political and economic development.” PHILIP T. HOFFMAN, author of Why Did Europe Conquer the World?

Recently Slate tech writer David Aurbach wrote a fascinating column about how Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language can account for much of the confusion that arises when we debate issues online. I thought this was as good an opportunity as any to debut my own long-held theory that The Big Lebowski (1998) demonstrates these exact ideas. That's right, folks: The Big Lebowski is based on Wittgenstein's philosophy of language.
That may sound like a stretch, but stay with me. Ethan Coen wrote their senior thesis at Princeton about Wittgenstein. There are a startling amount of parallels between Wittgenstein's work and the plot of this movie. There are also a few parallels between their life and the characters in this movie. And finally, it came out in 1998, when the concept of easy mass communication was first becoming a reality for the average person with the rise of 24-hour news networks and widespread internet access.
So it's fair to say that Ethan Coen might have come to some of the same conclusions based on early internet culture and illustrated them in the The Big Lebowski.
The main point that I think applies to both is Wittgenstein's concept of a “language-game” or what I want to call a “language puzzle.” They wrote a lot about how “philosophy is the battle against bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.” In other words, when we're doing philosophy, it's very easy to get caught up in language and just kind of start moving words around without saying anything, and then we feel like we're doing something when we're really not. The point of Aurbach's column is that this is also what happens when we debate online.
And I think that's the point of The Big Lebowski as well. Almost every character has a natural inclination to start engaging in some form of empty rhetoric or “language puzzles” except the Dude. Over and over scenes end when the Dude's conversation with another character slips into just moving words around detached from any meaning, at which point the Dude loses interest and just walks away.
For example, the scene when the Dude first meets Jeffrey Lebowski (introduced by Philip Seymour Hoffman asking the Dude “Do you speak English?”) ends when Lebowski launches into this 90s welfare/personal responsibility rhetoric (“Is that what you want? A handout?” “The bums lost, Lebowski. The bums will always lose.”). Nothing more to engage with here, so the Dude just puts on their sunglasses and walks away.
It's easy to see this exact speech Lebowski gives coming out of a cable news pundit or some right wing tweeter. It's a language puzzle. It means nothing, and the Dude is not interested.
This happens over and over in the movie, and the plot is pushed forward by their decisions to engage more and more with these language puzzles for a progression of reasons: first to get the money, which gets them further entangled in the plot, and then to get the girl back, and then to get out of trouble.
Consider Walter. Walter is basically a walking subreddit. Walter is everyone on Twitter who replies “Well actually…” At one point Walter literally says, “I'm not mad. I'm calmer than you are.” At the diner, the Dude has to literally tell Walter, “This is not freedom of speech thing, man!” And I think it's safe to say when the Dude tells Walter, “You're not wrong, man. You're just an asshole!” that is meant as one of the main takeaways of the movie. Their intelligence is completely bewitched by means of language. Whenever confronted with a problem, they start moving words around emptily and meaninglessly, and that is meant to solve it. “I got this. They're amateurs, dude.” “Not to worry. These men are nihilists, Donnie.” “They kidnapped that woman? That woman – that slut – kidnapped herself!”
This is obviously common in storytelling, but in The Big Lebowski I think it is super intentional, because it happens with every character (except the Dude) and even between characters. I, and many other people, have noticed that a number of phrases occur throughout the movie, spoken by different characters. In fact, someone took the time to find all of them and make this video:
I would say these are all very clear signals that a character is starting to move words around instead of actually use language meaningfully. These are meant to hint at the importance of Wittgensteinian language puzzles. And again, as the plot moves forward, the Dude engages with them more and more.
The trouble really starts when the Dude tells Walter that they have the briefcase full of money. Imagine what would happen if you asked Reddit what to do with a briefcase full of money. You would get much the same response: conspiracy theories, crazy plans to keep the money, etc. And the Dude of course is kind of tempted to believe Walter, because that's the effect money has on people, and this is shown by them justifying it to themselves with the Lenin quote. That's a language game: say quotes of powerful people to lend credibility to your own ideas. And then when they're in the car about to drop the money, Walter literally says “this is a game” over and over.
Maude Lebowski also relies heavily on language puzzles, but they know they are doing it. They know that they can just say “vagina” and “the word itself makes some men uncomfortable.” She's smart and uses these language puzzles to their own ends, and they like the Dude because they don't give a shit about them. That doesn't mean they will drop the façade and say what they actually mean, though. “He's a good man. And thorough. He's a good man. And thorough.” (Echoes of “It's our most moderately priced receptacle. It's our most…moderately priced receptacle.”) And of course there is the scene that ends with them and Knox Harrington (the video artist) talking and laughing on the phone in literally another language and the Dude walking away.
The German nihilists, of course, are Walter's greatest threat. They are ideological mercenaries, playing the same game they do, but for no reason other than money. If they are following these same rules, can the rules truly be said to have any meaning at all? “Say what you want about the tenets of national socialism, dude. At least it's an ethos.”
No wait, scratch that. Walter's greatest enemy is Larry Sellers, the kid who just stares at them blankly, not engaging. Even worse than their polar opposite ideologically is someone who refuses to engage whatsoever. This is what finally sends Walter over the edge and makes them start smashing the sports car with the golf club.
It's worth noting that probably the most famous single incident from Wittgenstein's life was a debate they had with philosopher Karl Popper (as in Hungus) at Cambridge about whether there are philosophical problems at all. Wittgenstein thought that all difficult philosophical problems were at their core this kind of language puzzles, and Popper thought they actually did represent meaningful issues in the world. Wittgenstein got so mad at one point that they picked up a poker from the fireplace and started waving it around. Popper was presumably not mad and actually very calm and actually it's funny that you would even think they were mad.
Golf club? Fire poker? The coincidences just keep piling up…
The thing is, though, Walter isn't the Wittgenstein figure. The Dude is. Again, Ethan Coen wrote their college thesis on Wittgenstein, so they would know that Wittgenstein was born in Austria in 1889 to one of the richest families in Europe, but chose to forego their inheritance (essentially giving up their name) to go do their own thing with no responsibilities.
They would also know that Wittgenstein had run-ins with the Nazis throughout their life, starting with going to elementary school with Adolf Hitler, and continuing into middle age when the Third Reich rose to power while Wittgenstein was in England teaching. As a Jew, they had a huge dilemma about the Nazis running their native Austria, but chose to deal with it by kind of not thinking about it.
Until, of course, 1939, when they were forced to confront this problem. The Nazis were threatening Wittgenstein's sisters Hermine and Helene, still in Vienna, and they went to Berlin (and Vienna and New York City – it must have really been a wild goose chase) personally to negotiate their safety in exchange for a huge sum from the family fortune.
They also had a huge amount of anxiety their entire life around their sexuality. There's a lot of debate about this, but I think they were what we would today call bisexual, having long relationships with both men and women. I imagine there was a good amount of anxiety about what would happen if the Nazis found out about that. Maybe even dream sequences about it. “We cut off your Johnson, Lebowski. Yaah.”
So this movie I think echoes the same point that Slate article makes, which is that Wittgenstein's theories about language resonate pitch perfectly with how we communicate with each other in the digital age. It's too easy to slip into playing these empty language games at the cost of actual meaningful communication, and that causes a huge amount of confusion that drives the various plots of life forward, as it were.
But it's important to point out that Wittgenstein didn't just say that it's difficult to talk about these hard issues. They would say that it's pointless to, and a waste of time, and even almost immoral beyond a certain point. They themselves quit philosophy altogether after writing a hugely influential book (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus) because they thought it was a waste of time to continue debating it (the original Port Huron Statement, not the compromised second draft). They also told (often their brightest) students to drop their class and go do something else. And the famous argument with Popper was basically them telling everyone “nobody needs to be talking about this! This is a huge waste of time! Go home!” (extreme paraphrase).
They wouldn't just say it's hard to debate issues on Twitter. They would say never tweet. And I think Lebowski says this as well, as the ultimate casualty in the end is Donnie, the only purely innocent character in the whole thing.
The Who
I'm your friendly neighborhood unix man. And I have a problem. I love regex. Now I have two problems.
The Why
Recently I have become destitute so I have taken to using the skills I have to provide for my poor sick family. It's mostly disabled cats. And when all you have is hammer, everything gets nailed. So I thought, you know what people probably don't automate enough of…Data Entry. I logged onto a freelance site of my choice, upwork. And found exactly what I wanted. Someone who wanted to turn a PDF into a csv. Particularly, a parts catalog into a shopify CSV.
The Good
The pdf was easy enough to convert into text, originally I thought I would convert all the pages into tiff's and use tesseract to OCR the characters. As it turned out this PDF was all selectable text, and just using pdftotext was sufficient.
For Mac:
brew install pdftotext brew install tesseract
All and all when this hideous brain child was finished, I had about an 87 percent success rate.
The Bad
There are things I regret, and things I regret. I am ashamed to admit this but one of the earlier things I did was strip all the quotes out of the resulting pdftotext file. Which was mostly so I could clean up the commas using this function:
function rqc () { awk -F'"' -v OFS='' '{ for (i=2; i<=NF; i+=2) gsub(",", "", $i) } 1' $@ | sed 's/"//g' ;}
This functions basically removes all the commas in between quotes in a csv, then removes the quotes. Yeah, for sure, there were better ways to deal with that. But it's not like I have a peer group of other regexers at beck and call.
The Ugly
Let's look at the code:
set -o nounset # Treat unset variables as an error BROAD=$(grep '[A-Z]\.' c.txt -A2 -B9) #List of all Skus #LIST=$(grep -P -o '\d{5}-\d{2}\w{0,1}' c.txt | sort | uniq ) LIST=$( grep -o '^[0-9]\{7,8\}' c.txt | sort | uniq ) #Temp for checking if adjacent price TEMP=0 for n in $(cat <(echo $LIST) ) do #Get Name NAME=$( grep "$n" c.txt -B9 | grep '^[A-Z]\.' | sed 's/^[A-Z]\. //' | sed 's/^[A-Z ]\+ \([A-Z][a-z]\)/\1/' | sed 's/"//g' | grep '[A-Z ]\+' | tail -n1 | sed 's/[a-z].*//' | sed 's/.$//' ) #Get Body DESCRIPTION=$( grep "$n" c.txt -B9 | grep '^[A-Z]\.' | sed 's/^[A-Z]\. //' | sed 's/^[A-Z ]\+\([A-Z][a-z]\)/\1/' | sed 's/"//g') if [[ -z $NAME ]] then NAME=$( grep $n c.txt -B10 | grep '^[A-Z]\+' | head -n1 | sed 's/^[A-Z]\. //' | sed 's/[A-Z][a-z].*//g') fi #Get Handle HANDLE=$( echo $NAME | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' | sed 's/ /-/g' | sed "s/$/-${n}/"| sed 's/[A-Z][a-z]//' ) #Get Price PRICE=$(grep "$n" c.txt -A6 | grep -P '${n} $\d+\.\d+' -o | grep -P '\d+\.\d+' -o) if [[ -z $PRICE ]] then PRICE=$(grep "$n" c.txt -A6 | grep -P -o '\$\d+\.\d+' | sed 's/\$//g' |tr ' ' '
' | head -n1) fi # Do Var Price Math FIFTEEN=$( echo "scale=2; (${PRICE}) * .15" | bc ) VARPRICE=$( echo "scale=2; ${PRICE} - $FIFTEEN"| bc ) # Add Sku to Name NAME=$(echo $NAME | sed "s/$/ - ${n}/" ) if [[ ! -z $n ]] then FINAL=$(echo "\"$HANDLE\", \"$NAME\" , \"$DESCRIPTION\", \"Vendor\", \"\" , , \"\", \"Title\", \"Default Title\", , , , , \"$n\", ,,,,,\"$VARPRICE\",\"$PRICE\"") fi if [[ ! -z $FINAL ]] then echo $FINAL fi done
I started doing this on my macbook air, Mac OS X uses the bsd cousins of grep and sed. More and more, for various reasons I saw myself using ggrep and gsed, rather than grep and sed. Mostly because of how the BSD sed deals with new lines, and because on occasion I wanted to use PCRE regex with grep, ie the -P flag. Eventually I fully switched to a linux enviroment, using the GNU toolset. The final straw actually had nothing to do with the tools, the resolution\screen space on MacBook Air, didn't allow me to see the lines the way I wanted them in a vimdiff. So I switched to a debian system in the final rounds of the script.

Police say the man accused of attacking Sen. Rand Paul could be charged with a felony because of the senator's condition. The Kentucky lawmaker's neighbor, Rene Boucher, is currently charged with fourth-degree assault.
The 59-year-old is accused of tackling the senator from behind while they were outside their home on Friday. The fight between two neighbors, both doctors, set off a round of newsroom speculation about what the motive could possibly be, reports CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds. What we've learned so far is that the tussle may have been about landscaping.
Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Jeremy Hodges said Sen. Paul's long-time neighbor, Rene Boucher, was initially charged with misdemeanor assault before Paul was medically evaluated. Paul's office later said they suffered five broken ribs from the attack.
"If it is found there was a serious physical injury that occurred, then the original assault charge, which was a misdemeanor, can be bumped up to the felonious charge of assault in the second degree," Hodges said.
Rene Boucher, pictured Warren County Regional Jail
The arrest warrant for Boucher said Paul suffered "small cuts to the nose and mouth area, and had trouble breathing."
Neighbors reportedly said the two men have a long-running dispute over yard waste.
Boucher admitted to going onto Paul's property and tackling them while Paul was reportedly mowing theirs lawn.
Matt Baker, Boucher's attorney, said their client is remorseful and the attack was not politically motivated.
"Politics has nothing to do with this. Zero," Baker said.
Paul's injuries could postpone their return to Washington, making it tough for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who is working to round up enough votes to pass tax reform.
Boucher's attorney told CBS News their client spent Friday night in jail and was released Saturday on a $7,500 bond. They said they will enter a not guilty plea at their court appearance Thursday.
The MAQ system uses a circular battery charger and measures the number of rotations and the rotation axis of a pitch. Users can view the data results on a smartphone app. (Provided by Mizuno Corp.)
In potentially bad news for baseball batters, sports product manufacturer Mizuno Corp. has developed a device that measures the spin on breaking balls, rising fastballs and other nasty pitches.
The MAQ system, which uses a ball with built-in sensors, not only records the speed of a pitch but also counts the rotations of the ball and pinpoints its rotation axis. Users can view the data results on a smartphone app.
The product, including main body and battery charger, is expected to go on sale for 34,800 yen ($318), excluding tax, next spring after further studies are conducted, Mizuno said Sept. 4.
Mizuno is targeting professional, university and high school baseball teams.
People looking for data on specific pitches can generally only find speed, such as “a 150-kph fastball,” even for curveballs and other off-speed pitches.
Mizuno said technology showing specific data on rotation and the rotation axis of pitches have not advanced, so it came up with the MAQ system.
According to Tsutomu Jinji, a member of the Mizuno development team and an associate professor of sports science at Kokugakuin University, the MAQ's rotation data, especially for sharp breaking balls, could become more common in baseball stats.
They also said analyzing the data could help hurlers gain more movement on their pitches to keep hitters off-balance.
The MAQ ball is covered in the same leather used for baseballs, and the weight is about the same.
According to Mizuno, the durable ball can be thrown 3,000 times at a speed of 130 kph without any problems.
The system can be recharged just by putting the ball in a circular wireless battery charger.
sickkids falls for medical luddism
A premiere pediatric hospital is being awfully friendly to anti-vaccine and homeopathic cranks and quacks.
The SickKids Foundation is a Canadian non-profit organization which runs a very highly respected pediatric hospital and funds research projects to provide cutting edge medical care to children. So you could imagine how bewildered David Gorski, aka Orac, was when they found out that the hospital is hosting a conference on autism with a roster of speakers which reads pretty much like a who's who list of anti-vaccine woo and New Age quackery. And their shock was only deepened when they confirmed that the anti-vax crowd isn't just renting space, but has a small grant from the Foundation, which recently started exploring homeopathy.
I know, I know, the vast majority of anti-vaccine activists have nothing but good intentions and they're doing it not because they want to endanger children, but because they're sure that they're protecting them from even bigger dangers than common childhood diseases. But you know the saying about good intentions. The road to hell is paved with them. And far from all the passionate anti-vaxers are doing it for the benefit of kids across the world. In fact, homeopaths are using the media generated panic over vaccine safety to drum up business, going on TV to question the safety of conventional medicine and touting the benefits of their sentient liquids, which unlike real medicine, don't have evil compounds with big scary names.
It's a disingenuous argument. Rather than compete with medical professionals on efficacy, the homeopaths talk about the lack of side-effects to their treatments. Which of course don't really have side-effects since they don't actually treat anything. For doctors, every medication is a balance between the potential danger and the anticipated benefit, backed by thorough, constantly ongoing studies. For homeopaths, some pseudoscientific forces are supposed to take care of the condition and they never bother to check whether the patient really did recover from something serious. A quick glance and the lack of complaints are enough to pronounce them or them cured, and present a sizeable bill for two atoms of flower powder in distilled water.
When a respected institution like SickKids gives grants to those who call themselves healers after neglecting all the hard work that has to come with that title, and keeps an open ear to outright quacks who ignore good science for the sake of personal satisfaction, they're giving undue legitimacy to people who have the potential to harm the children in their care either by doing nothing to help them and calling it treatment, or applying an untested, potentially dangerous quack cure to their conditions. Even worse, they're encouraging them to keep assailing real medicine and creating controversies rather than helping to solve problems. Let's keep in mind that as much as the quacks may want to help, they also want to be seen as visionaries who had the guts to stand up to the Big, Bad Scientific Establishment who were vindicated by those with an open mind, i.e. those who agree with them and can throw around some serious weight in the medical world.
Wendy's, the nationwide chain of fast-food restaurants, says it is investigating claims of a possible credit card breach at some locations. The acknowledgment comes in response to questions from KrebsOnSecurity about banking industry sources who discovered a pattern of fraud on cards that were all recently used at various Wendy's locations.
Bob Bertini, spokesperson for the Dublin, Ohio-based restauranteur, said the company began receiving reports earlier this month from its payment industry contacts about a potential breach and that Wendy's has hired a security firm to investigate the claims.
“We have received this month from our payment industry contacts reports of unusual activity involving payment cards at some of our restaurant locations,” Bertini said. “Reports indicate that fraudulent charges may have occurred elsewhere after the cards were legitimately used at some of our restaurants. We've hired a cybersecurity firm and launched a comprehensive and active investigation that's underway to try to determine the facts.”
Bertini said it was too soon to say whether the incident is contained, how long it may have persisted, or how many stores may be affected.
“We began investigating immediately, and the period of time we're looking at the incidents is late last year,” they said. “We know it's [affecting] some restaurants but it's not appropriate just yet to speculate on anything in terms of scope.”
When KrebsOnSecurity initially began hearing from banking industry sources about a possible breach at Wendy's, the reports were coming mainly from financial institutions in the midwest. However, this author has since heard similar reports from banks on the east coast on the United States.
The Wendy's system includes approximately 6,500 franchise and company-operated restaurants in the United States and 28 countries and U.S. territories worldwide. Bertini said most of the U.S.-operated stores are franchises.

Senate Republicans are talking about including some of the same controversial waivers from a House bill repealing ObamaCare that critics say could hurt people with pre-existing conditions.
Sen. John Thune John Randolph ThunePolls: Hiking estate tax less popular than taxing mega wealth, income Will Trump sign the border deal? Here's what we know Key GOP senator pitches Trump: Funding deal a 'down payment' on wall MORE (S.D.) said they think a Senate bill will allow states to waive some requirements for insurers.
“I think there will be some authorities for states because, like the House, we want to give the states as much flexibility as possible,” said Thune, the No. 3 Republican in Senate leadership.

A highly anticipated Congressional Budget Office report released Wednesday found the state waivers in the House bill could lead to skyrocketing premium costs for people with pre-existing conditions.
In states that waived certain coverage regulations for insurers, people could pay more than $1,000 per month for maternity coverage, the CBO found.
It also determined that many people with pre-existing conditions would be unable to afford coverage if they live in states that use the waivers.
“Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly,” the CBO report said.
Asked how the Senate would avoid raising costs for people with pre-existing conditions, Thune said: “That's what we have to try and do is come up with options in our version of the bill that prevent those types of outcomes.”
The language granting states the ability to waive certain rules was added in an amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.). The provision was key to the bill's passage in the House, as it won the support of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
Conservative lawmakers said they were determined that the House ObamaCare bill reduce premium costs, and the CBO estimates that the cost of premiums for healthy people would drop under the legislation.
The flip side of that, however, is that many people with pre-existing conditions in states that accept the waivers would see their costs soar.
And that's a political problem given promises made by President Trump and GOP lawmakers that ObamaCare repeal would not lead to lost coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
The House measure keeps in tact ObamaCare rules that prevent insurers from dropping people from coverage who have pre-existing conditions.
But it allows states to waive insurer requirements that could nullify those protections.
Specifically, states may allow insurers to charge some consumers more based on their health status. States could also drop requirements that insurers cover a list of 10 categories of services, including maternity care and mental healthcare.
A few Republican senators, such as Sen. Dan Sullivan (Alaska), are opposed outright to waiving the regulations.
Sullivan said they wanted to keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions that prevent insurers from dropping their coverage.
Asked if that meant the waivers, they said “no waivers.”
At the other end of the spectrum are Republicans who want to go even further than the House in allowing states to waive requirements.
“If we're going to lower premiums, we have to give consumers flexibility to be able to purchase more affordable plans,” said Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzTrump unleashing digital juggernaut ahead of 2020 Inviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Trump endorses Cornyn for reelection as O'Rourke mulls challenge MORE (R-Texas). “We have to give states flexibility to innovate to provide creative solutions so that those in need to receive better care.”
Another conservative, Sen. Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeePush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback The Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump escalates fight with NY Times MORE (R-Utah), wants to repeal the ObamaCare regulations as a default and let states opt back in if they want.
Most GOP senators are on a middle ground where they want to keep the ability for states to waive the regulations but provide more funding than the House bill did for high-risk pools or other mechanisms to try to help sick people get coverage.
“We want states to have flexibility, but that's why you need some kind of federal support or backstop like a risk pool or reinsurance so that people are comfortable that for chronic illness and pre-existing conditions, there's going to be coverage there and that their premiums won't become unaffordable,” said Sen. John Hoeven John Henry HoevenDem lawmaker 'confident' bipartisan group will strike deal on border funding Congress in painful start to avoid second shutdown Republicans want Trump to keep out of border talks MORE (R-N.D.).
They said the House bill did not have enough funding and that they wanted to consult with actuaries on how much is needed.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has said that any bill that passes the Senate must meet the “Jimmy Kimmel test," referencing an impassioned speech the talk show host gave in support of protecting those with pre-existing conditions.
Cassidy did not completely rule out waivers for states, if there is “very robust” funding as a backstop for sick people — more money than in the House.
He's working on a plan to help ensure those with pre-existing conditions can afford their premiums, but declined to go into further detail.
“I'm running it by people who really know their stuff,” Cassidy said, “so before I talk about it, I'd rather, it may be that it's just a dog. In the South that means something that's not very good.”
But the Senate — much like the House — has to balance the wishes of both conservative and moderate members.
Senate leaders have made clear they face a tough path to getting to 50 votes, on this issue and others. With a 52-48 majority, there's little margin for error.
“As Senator McConnell likes to point out, with 50 Senators needing to agree on this bill, everybody's in a strong position, so we can't roll anybody, so we're going to have to continue to talk about that issue and try to come to consensus,” Sen.

Frank Merenda has become a well-known figure in the mixed martial arts game recently for their controversial support of Jason Miller, and press releases, among other things. The Venator FC president is promoting their next event later this month and, whether he's doing the right thing or not, he's brought lots of attention to the Italy-based promotion.
No one has ignored what Merenda has said, either, including Venator FC fighters. They aren't oblivious to the situation. Venator FC middleweight Marvin Vettori, who competes on the main card of Venator FC 3, doesn't necessarily agree with Merenda's actions, but can't argue with the promoter, either.
"Oh man, yes. I've known the guy since day one because I've worked there for the first show. The guy is, I don't know how to find the right words (laughs)," they told BloodyElbow.com's The MMA Circus. "That's the way they do business. They don't really care about other things; they just does whatever they want. They have money to invest, and they invest how they want to. So, they just thought that's the right way to get attention, and they probably are right. They got everybody's attention. In a good way or a bad way, I don't think they really cares; they just wants to get bigger. And I'm not the promoter, I'm not their marketing guy. Their business talks for itself, and he's good at what they do. So that's the way he's doing it. I heard that the building where the show is going to be is packed so I think they did the right move.
"I'm not really here to say if he's right or not," they said. "I'm happy the organization in a way or another is getting attention. I'm on the main card, I'm happy about that. I hope many people watch it worldwide and that's it. I don't want to get involved in this promoting stuff because I don't really have a clue on it. If you fill up the building, then you're doing the right move."
Venator FC 3 features notable fighters including Rousimar Palhares, Mayhem Miller, Luke Barnatt and Matt Hamill. Vettori, the former Venator FC welterweight champion who's moving up to middleweight for the first time, is thrilled that Venator FC is drawing lots of attention.
"I'm very excited to be a part of a show where all these big names are on," they said. "Just happy to be a part of it and be there from day on. And I'm still the last welterweight champion, so being the champion of the organization. I'm there since day one. It's nice to be in an organization that was local but became very famous."
Vettori takes on UFC veteran Igor Araujo on the main card of Venator FC 3, which goes down from Milan, Italy on May 21. Vettori's goal is to pick up a stoppage win earning themselves a UFC fight, but if the UFC doesn't come calling, he's fine with fighting for Venator FC's middleweight strap against the winner of Miller vs. Barnatt.
"I mean, I think so," they said. "They're treating me good, and they stepped up the level of the Italian show. I'm going to fight for the belt. If the UFC [doesn't sign me], I think that's the next move. ... I mean, that's how it works. I'm still undefeated in that show, I was the welterweight champ. Now I move up a division, and at middleweight, I don't see why not."
Venator FC 3 takes place live from Milan, Italy on May 21.

BBC News, Denver
In a downtown loft apartment in Denver, Colorado, a group of 30-something women is having a party. They joke easily with each other about men, cats and botox. It's more Sex and the City than Psycho, but party organiser Dana Shafman would have them believe they could easily be victims of violent crime. They run a company that sells Tasers, the electric stun guns used by security forces around the world. In Colorado and other US states, it's legal for ordinary people to own them. Dana's marketing them to women as the ideal personal protection device. "I've been to everyone's Avon-type tupperware-style parties, purse parties, clothing parties, boutique parties and I felt like why not have a self-defence party? Why not have a Taser party, because without self-defence you won't have any of the other stuff." 'Take it to the gym' They give a presentation, including worrying crime figures for Denver. This is an unusual party, to say the least - there's food, but no alcohol, and much of the time is spent listening to disturbing statistics
But they also go on to show off the different colours that are available (bright red, soft pink and electric blue are all on display) and the fashionable accessories you can buy, including a carrying pouch made of fake leopard-print fur. "I sometimes carry mine with me like this to the gym," Dana says. You can order your Taser at this party. It'll cost you US $350 to buy (about £180), and you'll have to pass a background criminal record check first. Dana says they sold two Tasers in the six months before they started the parties. Now it's one a day. This is an unusual party, to say the least. There's food, but no alcohol, and much of the time is spent listening to disturbing statistics. 'Deaths in custody' The lone male party guest is Kevin Sailor, an off-duty police officer, brought in to demonstrate how a Taser works. The latest models are designed to appeal to women Like many a partygoer who doesn't really know anyone, they spend much of the time on their own, slightly awkwardly standing with their (soft) drink. But they hold court later, when explaining the device and how best to use it. He's a firm believer that Tasers are not permanently harmful - but civil liberties groups voice concerns over this. The American Civil Liberties Union argues there have been a number of deaths in custody, following Taser use by security officials. They want the devices more strongly regulated and oppose proliferation among civilians. But when I ask Kevin Sailor if they think America would be a safer place if everyone owned a Taser, they say: "Everybody that's a law-abiding citizen. Obviously cirminals or convicted felons, no I don't want them to be armed with one." They talk of levelling the playing field, and the party guests listen patiently and ask questions, but really they are just waiting to get their hands on a Taser and have a go. Dana talks them through how to hold one, load it and fire it and then it's their turn. By the way, they're aiming at a target pinned to a cork board, not each other. 'It kinda scared me' The first guest steps up, fires and runs to other side of the room, smiling, pleased with herself. Everyone else claps. The metal-coated paper target lights up as the current surges through it. "Don't touch the wires," warns Dana, "they're live." Later they show everyone the vicious metal barbs: "They're even harder to pull out!" they announce. The next guest, Amanda Moseley, puts their baby daughter in another room, then takes them turn. They fire, squeals and says: "It kinda scared me." Later they tell me they would consider buying one, because guns "are not really [her] thing". Growing phenomenon Veronica Sword looks pretty excited to have a go. "If it wasn't in a party atmosphere, I probably wouldn't have ended up learning about Tasers," they reveal. Lena Guare, whose apartment this is, takes their turn and says: "I thought there would be more of a kick to it, because I've shot guns before, but No, it was cool." They tell me they would consider buying one, because it might make them feel safer, especially when they go running alone. Parties like this are a growing phenomenon. While national security is an important issue in the US presidential race, local elections in America are often fought on the question of personal safety - numbers of police officers, how they are armed and how secure people feel in their neighbourhoods. In a country with about one gun for every adult, Tasers are sometimes touted as a less dangerous alternative. While some criticise parties like this Denver soiree for putting more weapons on the streets, several people here, tonight at least, seem convinced it's an effective way to exercise their constitutional right to bear arms.

Adding to the growing list of Irish fighters already set for action on Boston's January 18 date at the TD Garden, Cathal Pendred has been confirmed to meet American Sean Spencer at UFC Fight Night: McGregor vs Siver.
“It feels amazing, it worked out even better than I could've imagined,” said the Boston-born Dubliner who was linked with a UFC debut in Boston when they took victory over Che Mills in June 2013.
“I was able to make my debut in Dublin and experience that as my introduction to UFC. I've had another fight after that, so I'm going back home to Boston where I was born as an established UFC fighter, two fights and two wins into my career.
“This is a massive opportunity for me. I know UFC are keen on getting me onto this card. I've known for over a month that I would be on it. Even before this card was announced, I knew I would be on it.”
Pendred revealed how they were “pretty shocked” at getting Spencer as an opponent having gone through the UFC's welterweight division with a fine tooth comb after hearing they would be on the card.
They said: “I have no idea about the guy. I genuinely thought I had the list down to about ten people. I knew about it so far in advance I went through all 110 UFC welterweights and tried to figure out who I could be matched with.
“I took out the top ten straight away and then I start eliminating guys that were injured or already matched to face people. I had it down to about ten or fifteen guys and I don't even remember seeing this guy's name. I was pretty shocked, I was sure I had it figured out.
“The opponent never matters to me. I know he's had five fights in the UFC and he's 3-2. He's decent, he's fought at middleweight so he's obviously a good size and he's beaten Paulo Thiago like my last opponent did so he'll be a tough test. I'm extremely confident. I was disappointed with my last fight so I'm really going to look to put a stamp on this performance.”
Having already competed five times under the UFC banner, Spencer has had their hand raised on three occasions after getting the better of Yuri Villefort, Drew Dober and most recently, Paul Thiago who the Octagon MMA man claimed a decision over at UFC Fight Night: Bigfoot vs Arlovski.
Spencer succumbed to an arm triangle choke in their promotional debut in the third round of their bout with Rafael Natal at UFC on Fox: Johnson vs Dodson and was on the wrong end of the decision when they met Alex Garcia in a back and forth affair at UFC 171.
Pendred will look to go 3-0 with the world's flagship MMA promotion having taken a spectacular second round rear naked choke win over Mike King in their debut at UFC Dublin before seeing off Gasan Umalatov with a split decision win in early October.

If you've been fishing from a kayak for any period of time, you're familiar with the "You're crazy!" refrain from the public at large when you explain how you spend every free moment on the water. Kayak fly anglers likewise often get this response from other yak fishers when we reveal the long rod as our primary gear of choice.
Why fly fish from a kayak? Think back to when you started kayak fishing - the attractions are similar. It's easy to find peace on the water in a kayak, especially with a flyrod in hand. The reward is tremendous: the rhythm of casting, the thrill of fooling a fish into eating fur and feathers that you may have tied yourself, and the fight are just a few reasons to take the plunge and pick up the fly rod.
Gear:
Rods:
If you're already a flyfisher, you'll be fine with your current rods and reels, matched to your kayak quarry of choice. I have 9', 10', and 11' rods in various weights that I use depending on circumstances. A longer rod (9.5' or 10') is nice for keeping line off the water, but certainly not essential. There is conversely the short rod school of thought, to which my buddy Jeff introduced me: If you're not making long casts, it's easier to land fish and you're less likely to break a short rod high sticking a fish next to the boat.
Starting out in freshwater, a 6wt or 7wt is a good compromise rod: it'll throw bass bugs just fine, but won't be too exhausting to cast all day. In the salt, an 8wt is a good overall choice for the range of lines and flies you'll throw in most areas. These are just generalizations, however, and it's best to head into a local flyshop to get some advice. A fly outfit is a major purchase, and it's important to cast a few rods before you buy, just as it's important to demo a handful of kayaks before you purchase the right one. Rod, reel, line, leader, and fly selection are articles in and of themselves; your local flyshop and/or an experienced flyfisher can point you in the right direction based on your area and target species.
Fly gear isn't cheap; make sure you have the means to secure your rod in the event you turtle your kayak. I use a Scotty Fly Rod Holder, and I make every effort to ensure that the rod is in my hand or the holder at all times. Some flyfishers use a rod leash, but I find them cumbersome; it seems everything gets tangled as is.
Kayak:
For most kayak flyfishing applications, I'm looking for a wide and stable boat: something good for standing. If your kayak doesn't have a standing strap, seriously consider installing one. A clear deck is pretty much essential; your fly line will find every exposed protrusion on your boat and foul. I know this all too well, as it seems I always violate the clear deck rule. With a clear deck, the fly angler can strip line down into the boat, and have confidence that it will shoot clear when needed, either for a cast or the run of a good fish.
Tackle Storage:
I keep my flies in waterproof containers (boxes and sleeves) so I don't need to worry about rusted hooks - odds are your boxes will get wet at some point. I keep a foam drying patch inside my vest for smaller flies and another behind my seat for the big boys. Essential gear (pliers, hook sharpener, Boga-Grip, etc.) is stowed or connected so it won't foul my line.
Technique:
Casting (and standing--my favorite):
This is probably the largest adjustment for fly anglers starting to kayak fish. Casting from a sitting position can be a challenge at first, as your line is substantially closer to the water. Even experienced flyfishers tag the water on a backcast from time to time when they try to keep too much line in the air. If you concentrate on keeping your line speed high and shooting line for distance instead of carrying it, you'll be much happier. Fortunately, in our kayaks we can often sneak closer to the fish than boat-bound fly anglers, so shorter casts aren't too much of a handicap. Casting technique is, again, worthy of its own article.
Of course, standing will help alleviate the distance problem, but it presents a few issues of its own. It's a good idea to practice standing under controlled conditions, without your gear. After you're comfortable getting up and down, it's time for fun. Find a buddy and some deep water to test the limits of your boat's stability while you're standing. Lean out, sink the gunnels, fall out, and get some practice re-entering your kayak. Much better to go for a swim now than when you're standing over a pod of working fish. Once you've perfected standing, it's time to practice standing and casting - do it in shallow water where you can recover that outfit if necessary. Standing, paddling, and casting will eventually become second nature.
Stripping and Fighting:
To retrieve, I ordinarily tuck the rod under my armpit and strip with both hands. This gives plenty of room to vary the length and speed if my strips, whether I'm sitting or standing. I don't typically use a stripping basket or mat, but if you're going to be sight fishing where long casts are required, and your boat is rigged such that you're prone to foul the line, bringing one is a good idea. I prefer a clear deck, but each setup has its place.
Fighting fish with the fly rod from a kayak requires a bit of adjustment. I don't like to just strip my fish in, leaving a pile of line of the deck. Instead, I try to put all my fish on the reel, unless they're absolutely tiny, to avoid tangling a flopping fish in my line. To get a fish on the reel, pinch the line under your middle finger to maintain pressure on the fish, while using your pinkie to keep pressure on the pile of line as you reel it in. Larger fish will take out the entire pile of slack line as they run; your job is just to keep the line flowing through the guides until the fish is on the reel and taking drag. This process takes a bit of practice. The important thing to remember is: Keep pressure on the fish.
Once the fish is on the reel, use the leverage of the longer rod to work the fish and listen to the drag sing. The amount of pressure on a fish increases as rod angle decreases, so get down and dirty when you need to really work a fish. The added length of a fly rod is great for reaching around the front of your yak when a big fish makes a surge and runs under your boat.
Landing fish is simple enough, but the added rod length and line/leader connection of a fly outfit can be a pain. Minimize issues by using a line/leader connection that will slide through your guides with relative ease, and use as heavy a leader as possible. When you hook a decent fish, don't bring it too close; grab a wrap of leader, lip the fish with a gripper if you're so inclined, and use the leg scoop to bring it aboard. If the fish makes a last-minute surge, the smoothness of your line/leader connection may be put to the test as the fish tears it back through your guides. There's always the net option if you're so inclined, but I find that it's just another piece of gear to snag your line and/or lose.
Easing your kayak into a secluded spot where boats fear to tread and sightcasting in inches of water is what it's all about. If you've ever thought about picking up the long rod, find a local shop or experienced fly angler and start developing another fun and useful technique in your kayak fishing repertoire.
With Transformers: Age of Extinction getting closer by the day, it's a good time to take a look at the characters we've seen and heard about, and hopefully get a better idea of their role in the film. As always, beware of possible
The Humans
The human lead is(Mark Wahlberg). A struggling inventor, Cade finds a buried Transformer of some kind, and that discovery and its consequences set off the chain of events that our film will follow.
Cade's daughter Tessa Yeager(Nicola Peltz) is caught up in the action along with their boyfriend- a race car driver by the name of Shane Dyson(Jack Reynor). Shane has been a secret until now- but since the trio is seen escaping an explosion together in the trailer, it's fair to say that the cat will be out of the bag at some point.
The primary human antagonist is(Kelsey Grammer), who was not shown in the trailer but was seen in this behind the scenes video shown back in August of last year. Little is known about Attinger at the moment, but from Grammer's description of him, they would seem to be a government agent- of which government, we do not know, nor do we know what their goals are. Among the agents said to be under them is, who is played by Titus Welliver.Other human characters include would-be robot designer(Stanley Tucci) and their assistant(Sophia Myles), Cade's mechanic friend(T.J. Miller), and(Li Bingbing) who was referred to in anMagazine article as "CEO of the Chinese Transformers." It should be interesting to find out what that means, exactly.
The Bots
Confirmed to return and seen in the trailer are(voice of Peter Cullen) and(voice of carefully-sourced soundbites). Seen on-set in China are medic(voice of Robert Foxworth) and Wrecker(voice of John DiMaggio).
Among the newcomers are presumed Autobot, seen parachuting into a city battle guns-blazing in the trailer. They transformers into a C7 Corvette Stingray.
Seen here in toy form is "Duke" -all of the early information on the film's new robots used code-names from thefilm series. More recent lists of toys have suggested this will be Autobot. Hound transforms into an Oshkosh Defense MTV, and that's all we know about them so far.
Known to be in the film but not seen in the trailer is Autobot, who is said to be pretty much what they have been in the IDW comics: disgruntled former Decepticon turned Autobot samurai. The image above is a very low-quality scan from a costume catalog, but is presumed to be Drift based on what we know about their character. Drift turns into a 2013 Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse.
And then of course there are the Dinobots, starting with the mightyLittle is known about their role and character in the movie at this time except that they are a really big T. rex.
Longtime fans might be inclined to think that this two-headed pteranodon is Swoop, but the best information we have so far is that their name will beThis is pretty much all we know about this character at the moment.
On to the Decepticons! The `bot seen here shooting their mouth off is presumed to be Lockdown, and rumor has it that they are curator of a collection of ancient, deactivated Transformers. This is yet to be confirmed, however, so take it with a grain of salt for now. They become a 2013 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 Coupe.
...is that Megatron? Given leaked toy solicitations and Megatron's fate at the end ofthis is presumed at the moment to beHow they have been revived and by who is anybody's guess.Also said to be in the film are, a Decepticon who becomes a 2013 Pagani Huayra; andwhose alternate mode is not currently known. Vehicles believed to be Transformers are a Chevrolet Sonic RS, a Trumpchi E-jet, and one or more Local Motors Rally Fighter cars.There's also a super slick looking 2014 Freightliner Argosy and a2013 Chevrolet Camaro- knockoffs of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee? We'll see.As the movie nears release more will be revealed- and Toy Fair this coming weekend is probably our best opportunity to learn the identities of some of our mystery vehicles, as well as get better looks at bots like Drift. One thing is for certain: we've got aof new cast members both fleshy and ferrous, and hopefully we'll learn more about all of them in the run-up to
Former Vance HS star Torin Dorn will transfer to NC State. — Justin Byerly (@Justinbyerly) June 8, 2015
According to Justing Byerly of Big Shots Recruiting Torin Dorn is coming to NC State.
As you remember, we reported on Dorn's visit to NC State over a week ago. That visit must have sold him. Dorn is the former Conference USA first-year student of the year for UNC Charlotte.  They are a 6'5 guard physical guard with great hops and real scoring ability. They should fit in well with the Pack after their year of sitting out. Gottfried has had a great record with transfers so far, and this looks to be another great pull. They will have 3 years remaining.
We'll work on bringing you a more indepth look at Dorn very soon.
At the beginning of day three of the third Test of India's first tour of Sri Lanka, the home side was 153 for 5, but Duleep Mendis was unbeaten at the crease.
Do you remember Mendis? I am too young to, but I've heard the stories, and watched the Youtube clips. I'd learnt, from interviews, how in Sri Lanka's first-ever Test in England, Ian Botham was sure the English attack could just bounce Sri Lanka out, only for Mendis to hook them to the Lord's boundary all day long. I'd seen batting partner Sidath Wettimuny's eyes go wide as they remembered Mendis' audacity that day, and heard Roy Dias' voice brim with appreciation as they said: "We knew that there was a tussle between Botham and Duleep, and Duleep was coming out on top every time." Botham doesn't recall that Test at all (his exact words: "I've played over a hundred Tests. Why on earth would I remember a boring draw?"), but by the end of that match, so good had Mendis, and Wettimuny and Amal Silva been, that Botham was reduced to bowling offbreaks. It was only a draw, but for Sri Lanka of '84, it felt like a heist.
Next year, they beat India at home - their first Test victory ever. It was in the next game that they were wavering at 153 for 5 in response to India's 249. In the second innings of that match, Mendis and Dias rallied, hit a century apiece, and saved the match - securing the series win.
If, like me, you never had the pleasure of seeing Mendis bat, take a look on Youtube. See if an MS Fernando baila doesn't automatically start playing in your head as they play one of their front-leg-in-the-air pulls, or their limbs-splayed bludgeons through cover. But if you do remember their batting, cherish the memory. Emblazon into your mind the twin hundreds in Madras, or their 51 at P Sara in that inaugural win.
At the beginning of day three of the third Test of India's 2017 tour, Sri Lanka were 19 for 1 following on, still 333 runs behind. No senior batsmen rallied. No one hit a hundred to salvage a little pride, let alone save the game.

For everyone else, India's 1997 series in Sri Lanka may have been the most boring ever played, but on the island, it was a rocking celebration. I remember being unable to leave my seat in front of the TV for hours while Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya batted through days three and four at Khettarama. If I recall correctly, the fifth day of that match had been made free entry, and crowds had thronged the ground.
Sure, it would seem petty that Sri Lanka would pursue records excluding a chance at victory and even sportsmanship, but it didn't feel petty to Sri Lanka at the time. They had been minnows only two years ago. Then they had won the World Cup. This was their victory lap.
No one wanted the Jayasuriya innings to end via declaration. They had inspired a generation of pol adi hitters across the country - kids who would go out and will the bowler to send a short, wide ball just so they could play the cut. Who would deny their fans the chance to watch the man bat for any fewer than 799 minutes? Who would want to see them face any fewer than 578 balls?
And who would deny the heaving Khettarama the pleasure of seeing the master, Aravinda de Silva, hit a first-innings hundred on the fifth day? Who would take from them the joy of watching them bring that heavy bat down almost idly, only for the ball to vanish and suddenly reappear as it leapt off the rope to sting the boundary board?
Do you remember any of that? Cherish the memories. Relive the dazzling years of 'Sana' and 'Ara' in your mind.
India's 2017 series in Sri Lanka may also go down as one of the most boring ever played. This time, there are no heaving stands. There is no island celebration.

When India came to tour in 2008, Sri Lanka had two of the world's most fearsome bowlers, and perhaps the cleverest captain around. Throughout that three Test series, India failed to decrypt Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan. They tried sometimes to play them off the back foot, other times the front; attempted occasionally to beat them into submission, and sometimes to starve them out. They played Mendis like a seam bowler. They tried reading the ball off the pitch. In the end, none of this mattered; nothing really worked.
And in Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka had a leader with a finger on the pulse of virtually every match, a constant ear to the ground, and an innate sense of when the moment lay waiting to be seized. They prodded opposition batsmen into awkward corners, they had their bowlers take top orders by the collar, they lay traps, they played mind games, and their team won 2-1. Additionally, their mastery of the DRS system in that series helped turn a generation of India players against the idea.
If you have memories of Murali and Mendis terrorising some of the best players of spin in history, keep them close. If you recall a tasty Mahela ambush, bring it to mind and play it over.
At Pallekele, Sri Lanka virtually gifted Hardik Pandya a maiden Test century, thanks in part to senselessly negative tactics, wherein nine men stood at the boundary all throughout the over. When Sri Lanka batted, one of their most senior men edged a ball, and incredibly, squandered a review after they had been given out. It is India's fearsome spinners now - including the two-Test old Kuldeep Yadav - who have trussed Sri Lanka up and shoved them into a chasm.
Sri Lanka have had poor series against India before, but never one this bad. They have been through lulls, transitions, terror attacks, contracts crises, and post-World Cup funks, but almost never in the past 20 years, have they been this muddled, so fearful, so un-watchably, relentlessly meek.
Sanath Jayasuriya chats with the Sri Lankan players AFP
The many reasons for the decline have been laid out over and over, like here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here or here.
Maybe you grew up with M Sathasivam, Michael Tissera or Anura Tennekoon innings being swooned over on the radio. Maybe you fell in love with a photograph of a Wettimuny square drive, a wagging Arjuna Ranatunga finger, or clips of Chaminda Vaas outswingers, Lasith Malinga lifters, and Kumar Sangakkara's bent-kneed cover drives.
Cherish those memories, because what if nothing changes? Make sure to remember the night in Lahore, the afternoon at The Oval in 1998, those endless batting days at Asgiriya, and the irrepressible spin-bowling revelry at Galle.
There is real fear building. Not long from now, what if memories are all that remain?
The Wall Street Journal just published a review of the Global Warming Forecasts for the past 30 years. They have not even come close to the scenarios they put forth back in 1988. On June 23, 1988, the then NASA scientist James E. Hansen who helped to start all this nonsense testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. They stated that they expressed had a “high degree of confidence” in “a cause-and-effect relationship between the claimed CO2 induced “greenhouse effect and observed warming.” That is how government characterizes something when they are guessing – “high degree of confidence” which was the same words used to invade Iraq who had weapons of mass destruction. They later came out and said: “Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.” (August 25, 2002). The CIA Director testified before Congress and said: “We said in the estimate with high confidence that Iraq had them.” see Transcript Washington Post). Why does anyone EVER believe those in government? They cannot even forecast GDP accurately when they fudge the numbers.
Here is Hansen's forecast. The dark red overlay is actual surface temperatures reported and there is even a controversy surrounding them that they have been constantly skewed higher to not look like complete idiots. Even the models devised by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are at least twice the actual temperature by now even with fudged numbers. So why are all these model so exaggerated?
These models are completely VOID of cyclical models and they do not even understand that this is a cycle. They are constructed with same idiotic bases that whatever trend is in motion will remain in motion. The Dow Jones Industrials closed 1932 at 60.26 and 1933 at 98.67. That was a 63.7% gain year over year. By assuming that trend will remain in motion, which was their dire forecast, the Dow would have reach 96,433,885,025.00 by 1975. That makes 50,000 look cheap.
Even averaging a 5-year advance VOID of understanding cycles, fails to provide a valid forecast ever. If I take the closing in the Dow of 2009 and the closing of 2014, the average advance was 1479 points per year. Now take the 2014 closing of 17823.07, that gives me 25,218.09. That is fine because we have been in a bull market. We all know the cycle will change. That is what is wrong with the global warming forecasts.
What actually happened, they got $1 billion for research by scaring the HELL out of everyone. I wonder what kind of chart I should make to get $1 billion handed to me from Congress with no performance requirements. What a deal.
Looking to attract a New York lady? Grab a cup of joe.
It's an established fact that how a guy smells is one of the top things that determine whether a girl will find them attractive. In fact, two of three women say they are actually more likely to make out with a guy on the first date if they smell good.
Women in New York really get off on the aroma of coffee, according to a survey commissioned by AXE men's grooming products, and considering New York is the nation's top city for singles, gentlemen should use that to their advantage.
Contrast that with findings from, say, Los Angeles, where women dig a whiff of lavender. In Dallas, women go gaga for the smell of smoke (from campfires and grills, not cigarettes) and in Philadelphia, it's the smell of clean laundry that gets the juices flowing, the survey found. Overall, the scent of vanilla captivates women across the nation.
"In each city we tested, girls reported different scent preferences, indicating that geography has a direct correlation to what scents they find attractive," scent expert Dr. Alan Hirsch, director of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, whom AXE enlisted to compile the findings, said in a statement. "Guys should heed these findings as research has shown that when women are in the presence of a preferred scent, they are more likely to project positive feelings on those around them, which can lead to increased attraction."
The survey also revealed that 56 percent of women nationwide would not date a guy who wears the same cologne as their dad. And here's a dirty little secret; 25 percent of women surveyed said they wait up to a month to change the sheets to keep the scents of their man lingering.
Two thousand women ages 18 through 35 underwent live interviews as to their most preferred aromas. Two hundred subjects were selected per city.
Current Culture Under Current 6 Questions & Answers
General Recommendations
What are the most common mistakes made in water culture?
a. Running nutrient strength too high. This can inhibit water uptake and contribute to metabolic stagnation and subsequent plant stress.
b. Using incompatible inputs in solution causing convolution of the water chemistry. Avoiding organic, low solubility inputs is strongly recommended.
c. Micromanaging pH. Adjusting pH too frequently can lead to nutrient solution instability and issues.
What makes the Under Current a more efficient hydroponic method?
Less frequent nutrient change outs, lower nutrient usage rates, less pH fluctuations (less pH adjusters needed) and the conservation of precious H2O.
What makes the Under Current more productive compared to other hydroponic systems?
When a water culture system is operated properly, plants benefit from an increased uptake of water and minerals in solution as well as sustained cell turgidity. Given the favorable CEC of water, a plants nutrient uptake efficiency in water culture is very high, resulting in superior results.
Planning And Sizing
What is the approximate volume of solution in each module during standard operation?
a. 8 gallon – approx. 6 gallons
b. 13 gallon – approx. 10 gallons
c. 35 gallon – approx. 30 gallons
How do I calculate my total system volume?
a. Multiple total number of modules plus 1 (for Epicenter) multiplied by the approximate volume per module. Take this volume and add 10% to account for solution in joints and manifolds.
b. Example: UCDB16XL –
i. 17 x 6 gallons per module = 102 gallons
ii. 102 + 10% = 112 gallons
Can I integrate a nutrient auto dosing system?
Yes.
What is a top-off reservoir and why do I need one?
A top-off reservoir is used to maintain consistent system volume and water chemistry. The top-off reservoir will supply solution via gravity to the float valve in Epicenter (control module).
Do I need a water chiller?
Yes.
Do I need a Bulkhead Filter for each growth module?
No.
Is there an option for custom system spacing?
Yes, all systems are available in a “Boneless” configuration without straight sections of pipe, allowing you to customize your plant centers.
Does a "Boneless" system include instructions on how to cut/couple pipe?
Yes, each “Boneless” kit includes a Boneless cut chart and recommendations for gluing and assembly.
Operating the Under Current
Should the Air Pump and Water Pump run 24/7?
Yes.
Where should I set my solution level?
a. Initial Transplant: See diagram.
b. Veg: 2” above base of net pot.
c. Bloom: 1” below base of net pot
What should be in my top-off reservoir?
When operated properly, top off should be balanced the same or slightly higher as the solution in the system.
Does a top-off reservoir help maintain water chemistry (pH/EC) stability?
Yes. Any fluctuations in pH/EC can have a negative effect on plant health.
How do I adjust pH?
a. CAUTION: Do NOT add pH concentrate directly to Epicenter (control module).
b. If the pH is between 5.5-6.5 no adjustment is necessary.
c. Dilute pH adjuster 1:128 (about 1 oz. adjuster per gallon of fresh water). Once diluted slowly add to the system, allow 20-30 minutes for mixing. Re-test once pH has stabilized, add more diluted adjuster as necessary.
What solution temperatures are optimal?
We recommend maintaining a water temperature between 65-68 degrees F.
What solution temperatures are optimal?
We recommend maintaining a water temperature between 65-68 degrees F.
Do I need to include the initial PPM of my source-water when calculating nutrient levels?
Yes. Adjust accordingly.
Do I need to include the initial PPM of my source-water when calculating nutrient levels?
Yes. Adjust accordingly.
Do I have to empty out the entire system to do a nutrient change-out?
No.
What do I use to clean the system? Mix Ratio of Cleaning Agent?
Physan 20, follow manufacturer's directions.
Growing in the Under Current
How do you veg for the system?
a. Under Current system (8 gallons): Bare root or cube (rock wool, oasis, etc) propagated plants can be placed directly into our CCH2O Net Pot and placed directly into a Under Current system for optimum growth. This technique is perfect if subsequently transplanting into a larger Under Current system (13 gallons or 35 gallon PRO) at a wider plant spacing.
i. In this case, the entire CCH2O Lid (with Net Pot) can be picked up and moved directly to another Under Current growth module for flowering. This method is ideal for avoiding unnecessary root damage during transplant into bloom.
b. Ebb and Flow table (Periodic Flood): Bare root or cube (rock wool, oasis, etc) propagated plants can be placed directly into our CCH2O Net Pot or 4″/6″ rock wool cubes and placed in a typical tray. Some natural root pruning may occur as the roots grow through the net pot due to the intermittent watering cycle.
c. Ebb and Flow Table (Continuous Flood): Bare root or cube (rock wool, oasis, etc) propagated plants can be placed directly into our CCH2O Net Pot or 4″/6″ rock wool cubes and placed in a typical tray. Adding air diffuser to the tray will create a water culture environment. This will stimulate root growth similar to the Under Current system and prepare the plants for a fairly seamless transition.
d. Drip: Bare root or cube (rock wool, oasis, etc) propagated plants can be placed directly into our CCH2O Net Pot or 4″/6″ rock wool cubes. A drip system with emitters in each net pot/cube can be placed on a bench or in a flood tray. Some natural root pruning may occur as the roots grow through the RW cube.
What grow mediums are recommended for use in the Under Current?
a. Any non-wicking inert grow media tends to work best. Expanded clay pellets and growstones are some of the most popular.
b. When using a wicking media like rockwool be sure to adjust solution level to ¼” below contact with the R.W.
Nutrient Considerations
What is the best nutrient for the Under Current?
Pure mineral-salt based nutrients like Current Culture's Cultured Solutions are the most compatible with actively aerated water culture.
What is the recommended nutrient strength for the Under Current?
a. Veg: 100-400 ppm / 0.2-0.8 EC
b. Bloom: 450-900 ppm / 0.9-1.3 EC
c. **Based on ppm 500 scale
Are carbohydrates/sweeteners, enzymes and beneficial bacteria recommended in the Under Current?
No. These tend to create bio-films and de-stabilize water chemistry.
Should I use Ca/Mg in the Under Current?
When using Reverse Osmosis (RO) or De-Ionized (DI) water Calcium Magnesium is recommended at 0.25-1mL per gallon. The Cultured Solution's Coco Cal Supplement is your best choice.
Should I change my nutrient strength each week?
Follow manufacture's nutrient schedule as recommended.
How frequently should I change my nutrients?
Change outs are recommended every 7 to 14 days, or if pH becomes de-stabilized (drifts more than 0.3 per day).
Do I need to flush my system between change-outs?
No, assuming only compatible inputs are being used a simple drain and refill is sufficient.
Is it possible to over-aerate my Under Current?
Yes, we recommend aeration levels stay between 0.75-1.5 liters per minute/per gallon. Exceeding these levels may cause mineral precipitation and nutrient de-stabilization.
Troubleshooting
What should I do if I make a mistake?
Observations and slight adjustments are the best way to dial your system in when in doubt give us or CCH2O a call.
There seems to be a little confusion about the new on-camera layout rules for PTs and GPs, and a bunch of it is coming because of misunderstanding over what it means to be a rule.
While these are “rules”, they aren't rules in the same sense as the contents of the Comprehensive Rules. They set out a list of expected norms that we want players to adhere to while on camera. That makes sense – a player tuning in to coverage can more quickly get themselves up to speed if they don't have to spend the first few moments figuring out where everything is.
The rules themselves provide for a fair bit of discretion. The guidelines even acknowledge that some things don't have an overwhelmingly-accepted answer (your deck can be on either side, for example). As long as you're adhering to their spirit, we're not going to worry about the exact letter of the law. You gained control of a creature with equipment on it? Nobody is going to be upset if you don't turn the equipment the other way around. You turn a single land upside down to indicate you played it this turn? Not a problem!
Common sense continues to apply. A card exiled by Shelldock Isle should be near/under the land. A card exiled by Necrogenesis doesn't need to be. As long as the board broadly conforms to the expected style and information is grouped relevantly, that's all that's being asked for. How we handle the extreme outliers – dredge comes to mind – remains to be seen, but those are few and far between and hopefully appropriate norms will emerge.
Even if your board is too far outside expectation to be acceptable, judges won't be coming down with penalties. Just a friendly nudge that you need to move something a bit to make it clearer to everyone. Fix it up and play on.
Thankfully, we dodged the true holy war. Your lands can still be tapped in either direction!
Martin Havlat, the winger who once starred for the Ottawa Senators, Chicago Blackhawks, and San Jose Sharks in numerous playoff runs, announced their retirement from the NHL on Wednesday.
The 35-year-old veteran released the news through the NHL Players' Association nearly 14 months after they last played on NHL ice with the St. Louis Blues.
"I'm not angry now, just happy I did everything I could." Martin Havlat looks back on playing 14 seasons in the NHL. https://t.co/frGwupJeDH pic.twitter.com/GR9FkVv3jL — NHLPA (@NHLPA) February 8, 2017
Havlat only skated two games with the Blues in 2015-16 before requesting they terminate their contract so they could play at home in the Czech Republic. Havlat revealed on Wednesday that injuries disrupted the final stretch of their career.
Hockey was my life, but the last few years, I just couldn't play the way I wanted to play. My heart wanted to keep on going, but my body didn't allow me to do it. I felt it was time. I know I've made the right decision. I had already undergone a shoulder surgery, a serious pelvic injury and other injuries, but my whole career I dealt with groin problems. I was able to manage the groin problems well enough that nobody would notice. But in the end, the damage was done. Some players never get hurt, but not me. I'm not complaining. I feel very fortunate to have had the career I've had.
Havlat finished third in Calder Trophy voting as a rookie with the Senators in 2000-01. They became a 30-goal scorer in Ottawa before the Senators traded them to Chicago before the 2006-07 season. They finished out their career with stints in Minnesota, San Jose, and St. Louis.
Havlat enjoyed strong playoff success with Chicago and Ottawa, putting up 52 points and 21 goals in 72 career playoff games. During Ottawa's run to the Eastern Conference Final in 2002-03, Havlat put up five goals and 11 points. They also had three playoff overtime goals.
The Czech Republic native finishes their career with 242 goals, 352 assists, and 594 points.
Varun Gandhi (born 13 March 1980) is an Indian politician.  They are a member of Parliament for Lok Sabha from the Sultanpur constituency.  They are also member of Bharatiya Janata Party and was inducted into Rajnath Singh's team in March 2012 as General Secretary.[7] Varun Gandhi is a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
Early life and education [ edit ]
Varun Gandhi was born in Delhi on 13 March 1980 to Sanjay Gandhi and Maneka Gandhi.  They are the grandson of former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi and the great-grandson of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Varun was born soon after Indira Gandhi regained power in the 1980 general elections. Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash when Varun was three months old in June 1980. Indira was assassinated when Varun was four years old on 31 October 1984. Before their death Sanjay Gandhi had expressed their interest in raising their children in accordance to their Zoroastrian religion.[8] Varun attended Rishi Valley School and Modern School C.P. New Delhi and the British School, New Delhi, where they ran for a position on the student council.[9]
Varun earned Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Economics from University of London.[1][2][3][4][5]
Early political career [ edit ]
Varun Gandhi was first introduced to the Pilibhit constituency by their mother during the 1999 election campaigning.[10] Maneka had been a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) since earlier but they and Varun formally joined BJP in 2004.[11] Varun Gandhi campaigned for the party in the 2004 elections, covering over 40 constituencies.[12]
In an interview to Stephen Sackur in BBC's HARDTALK in October 2005, Gandhi answered questions about the reasons behind their political affiliation and defended their father as someone who had helped revive the industrialisation of India by starting Maruti Udyog and whose strategy helped the Congress party's comeback after the first ever non-Congress Janata Party government following an electoral routing for the Indira Gandhi-government after Emergency, among many other things.[13]
As a Member of Parliament [ edit ]
In the 2009 general election, the BJP decided to field Varun Gandhi as its candidate from the Pilibhit constituency instead of their mother Maneka Gandhi.[14] They won the seat by receiving 419,539 votes and defeated their nearest contending candidate, V.M. Singh, by a margin of 281,501 votes.[15][16][17][18][19] The victory was the strongest of any of the four Gandhi family candidates in the election: their mother Maneka Gandhi, aunt Sonia Gandhi and first cousin Rahul Gandhi. The security deposits of all other candidates, including those of V.M. Singh of the Indian National Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Ganga Charan Rajput were forfeited.[20] A case was filed against Gandhi for allegedly making a provocative speech about Muslims, at a meeting at Dalchand Mohalla area of Pilibhit, however they were acquitted by in court in the matter.[21][22] On 5 March 2013, a Pilibhit court acquitted Gandhi in the second hate speech case registered against them during the 2009 Lok Sabha election campaign.[23]
In March 2013, Rajnath Singh appointed Varun Gandhi as the national general secretary of the BJP. They became the youngest ever general secretary of the party. In May 2013, Varun Gandhi was made in-charge of the BJP's affairs in West Bengal. In June 2013, Gandhi requested Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar to call an emergency all party meeting in view of the calamity in Uttarakhand in which thousands of people had died. They suggested a number of steps like contribution from MPLADs fund, forgoing of three months salary by MPs and tax incentives for corporate and individuals for help. They have said that they spoke to many MPs and all of them were ready to contribute. They said that the Speaker should act as a catalyst and coordinate the action plan.[24]
In July 2013, Gandhi handed over a cheque of Rs 1 lakh from their salary account to family members of former Jan Sangh Member of Legislative Assembly late Bhagwati Prasad, who died at a government hospital after prolonged illness and age-related complications. The former MLA had to spend over an hour on the floor of an emergency ward before doctors at the hospital realised they were an ex-MLA and was subsequently given medical attention. Their family didn't even have money to perform the last rites after their death. Varun said they came to know about Prasad only after their death. Describing the late MLA as a model of honesty, they said it was hard to find an honest leader like him.[25]
In August 2013, newspapers reported that Gandhi was the only MP in the country who had spent cent per cent of their MP Local Area Development Fund (MPLAD) before stipulated time. According to official sources, Varun Gandhi used their funds for the development in education, health and infrastructure activities. Their proposals were worth more than the entire MPLAD fund thus ensuring the entire amount of `25 crore was spent during their tenure as a Member of Parliament. Their political aides stated that they submitted the proposals on time and also employed their personal team to monitor the use of money.[26]
In September 2013, Varun Gandhi accused the Samajwadi Party-led Uttar Pradesh government of pursuing the politics of appeasement, and said that its mistakes would lead to its collapse, after it denied permission to Varun Gandhi's rally in Agra just two days before it was scheduled to take place.[27]
They denounced Rahul Gandhi's infamous outburst against the controversial ordinance against convicted lawmakers, and said that it was an insult to the Prime Minister, who was abroad at the time, and therefore also disgraceful to the nation.[28] They also said that if the Prime Minister had any dignity left, they should resign immediately upon their return to the country, on the day of Rahul Gandhi's outburst.[29] In March 2014, they said that they hold no ill-will against Rahul Gandhi and won't campaign against them during Lok Sabha Election.[30]
In February 2014, Gandhi kickstarted their campaign for election 2014 in Sultanpur. They gave an emotional speech to an enthusiastic crowd in Kadipur, and said that they had come to Sultanpur to fulfill their father's dreams.[31]
In May 2014, Gandhi defeated Amita Singh from Sultanpur in Lok Sabha 2014 elections.[32]
In March 2016, they introduced the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2016 in Lok Sabha.[33]
Jan Lokpal Bill [ edit ]
In August 2011, Varun Gandhi strongly pitched for the Jan Lokpal Bill. Gandhi offered their official residence to Hazare to hold their fast, after Hazare was denied permission by the government.[34] When Hazare was jailed, Gandhi offered to table the Jan Lokpal Bill in Parliament.[35] On 24 August, they went to Ramlila Maidan as a common man to support the cause of Anna Hazare, becoming the first politician to openly support the anti-corruption cause.[36]
Columnist [ edit ]
Writes articles and policy papers for several national dailies and magazines in India, such as The Times of India, The Hindustan Times, The Economic Times, The Indian Express, The Asian Age, The Hindu, Outlook among others. Writes the largest syndicated column in the country covering 21 newspapers – including Malayala Manorama, Lokmat, Hindustan Times, Rajasthan Patrika, Punjab Kesari, Amar Ujala, Sandesh, Bartaman, Sakshi – reaching more than 200 million readers.
Author and poet [ edit ]
Gandhi wrote their first volume of poems, titled The Otherness of Self, at the age of 20, in 2000. Their second volume of poems, titled Stillness was published by HarperCollins in April 2015. The book became the bestselling non-fiction book, selling over 10,000 copies in the first two days of its release.[37]
In 2018, they released their book on the Indian rural economy titled The Rural Manifesto: Realising India's Future through their Villages. The book sold over 30,000 copies in ten days of its release. [38]

By Raj Parmar: Rafael Garcia, the long-time corner man of pound for pound king Floyd Mayweather, has officially announced that they will no longer be a part of Mayweather's future fights in a corner man capacity. Garcia served as cut-man for Floyd for many years and also was in charge of wrapping Floyd's hands but is now ready to retire from the sport at 85 years old.
Mayweather themselves as well as other members of Floyd's camp have always been quick to praise Garcia and lauded them as the best cut-man in the game. This past weekend's fight between Mayweather and Marcos Maidana saw some changes though in the regular procedures for how Floyd prepares for a fight, as Garcia was not the one to wrap Floyd's hands. Another member of Mayweather's camp named Bob Ware wrapped Garcia's hands.
“Yes, it's true I didn't tape him, but they haven't fired me,” Garcia told ESPNDeportes.com, “I thanked them after the fight because I retired from boxing, but I'm fine with him. Thanks to them I live how I live.”
Floyd had hinted at tension between themselves and Garcia earlier in the week due to the fact Garcia wanted to wrap their hands. However Mayweather stated Garcia was working the corner of Mayweather Promotions fighter Mickey Bey and therefore they had to use somebody else to wrap their hands. Floyd went on to state that the way Ware wrapped their hands was the best they have ever felt in their entire career.
Garcia for their part has nothing but praise for Mayweather and is happily ready to step away from the sport at this time. They feel that their role is being reduced in the Mayweather camp and wants to walk away before they become totally irrelevant in the camp.
“Floyd told me to go with Mickey Bey for their fight against Miguel Vazquez,” Garcia explained. “When I came back they were already taping him. I didn't oppose to it, he's the one fighting, not me, and before they push me aside, I leave and thank them for everything. Maybe I'll go to the gym and watch them and the others, but I'm all grown up, I want to enjoy life.”
There has been a lot of talk recently of Mayweather rearranging their whole team by the time their next fight in May 2015 rolls around, and Garcia not being the cut-man looks to be the first change.

TULSA, Okla. - Tulsa is lucky to have a beautiful and unique old theater downtown, though perhaps the Circle Cinema did not always attract people interested in a beautiful and unique theater. The theater, recently renovated again and offering three screens, an art gallery, and improved refreshment concessions, was at one time the place to go for the latest in adult movie entertainment.
But the origins of this theater were definitely not in the pornographic arena. When it opened in 1928, it was a modern entertainment venue that also housed the latest in apartment living above the theater. The area in which the theater was located was the first suburban shopping center in Tulsa.
Though 1st and Lewis has changed quite a bit over the years, the Cinema has returned to its roots, offering the best in movie entertainment.
It generally shows independent films and documentaries that would not normally be picked up by the standard theaters. It also showcases Oklahoma or Oklahoma-related films, such as August: Osage County, which family members and I got to see this past weekend. It was Aunt Doris's birthday, so we all loaded up to take them out to eat and to the movie.
The film was showing in one of the recently-opened screens at the Circle. The seats were comfortable, the sound impressive, and the size of the theater just right.
After the film, my mother, Betty, reminisced about taking a bus from out in the boondocks where they lived to the Circle Cinema in 1958 to see a film. They don't remember the film, but it was in the soft-core porn category, and even though the theater was not known for adult films until the 70's, Mom said, “Oh everybody knew you could see something a little different at the Circle, even in the 50's.”
My elder sister, Roxann, remembers going to the Circle in the late 70s with their then-boyfriend, later husband. They said, “It was dark and breathy and sparsely attended. Creepy sex sounds lit up the room.”
Thankfully, the Circle Cinema no longer is quite the same experience. The “creepy” only appears if you are actually watching a creepy movie. I have seen some impressive films lately at the Circle, such as Holy Motors, a thoroughly strange and enjoyable film with Denis Lavant and Eva Mendes, which was as delightful as it was odd. This is a great place, generally, to watch a film uninterrupted by the sounds of babies and children, or even teenagers for that matter.
At the Circle, you can book one of the screening rooms for a private party. Also, there are plenty of tables and chairs for an event in the lobby. Artwork by local artists is always on display so you can come in and enjoy it even if you don't come in to see a film. The current art exhibit is by Cindy Parsons and Karin Cermak, whose works complement one another. Most of their paintings are available for purchase. I particularly liked Cermak's Love Letter which displays a woman's hand raised toward a dove suspended in space with a letter in its beak.

A thin smile graced their lips as they examined the coat of dust that had come to cover the plate from top to bottom. It was rude to the suit, of course, and rude to its creator, but they left it all the same. It was, to her, a sign of their success, of all the decades that their leadership had forestalled war and strife reaching Equestria. For as long as they could, Celestia would shine like the sun, and keep the lands and ponies they had worked so hard for safe.

So here we are again. Another half journey around the sun, our moody but unyielding anchor in the cosmos. This year, we had the opportunity to watch the reincarnation of Cosmos, which did a fantastic job of capturing the wonder not only of the scope and possibility of the known and unknown universe, but told our maturation to our current day as a tale of mighty accomplishment, with a still more glorious accomplishment to go. In the words of the show's original creator, I believe "it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."
Why do I bring this up? Well for starters, I followed Summer Sun Celebration customs and stayed up until sunrise, so I'm working on about 4 hours of sleep. But more importantly, I believe we, as whatever group we might identify as, have come to some understanding that kindness, imagination, and wonder are not the misgivings of children, but the driving powers of our people. So today, on this longest of days, and hopefully all days, give someone a smile, or do something kind for another. And give our sun, the closest we have to a cosmic parent, a nod of thanks for carrying us through the cold and the dark.
BANGKOK — A parcel delivery company in Bangkok put three packages bound for the United States through a routine X-ray and made a startling discovery — inside were a variety of preserved human parts, including an infant's head, a baby's foot and an adult heart.
The company, DHL, alerted police who tracked down the sender, a 31-year-old American tourist who said they found the items at a Bangkok night market, police Col. Chumpol Poompuang said.
“He said they thought the body parts were bizarre and wanted to send them to their friends in the U.S.,” Chumpol said, adding that the man was questioned for several hours and released without charges.
The three packages, which contained five body pieces, were labeled as toys, police said. They were being sent to Las Vegas, including one parcel that the man had addressed to himself.
Chumpol had earlier said a baby's heart and intestines were among the body parts. But police at a news conference later in the day said the heart, which had been stabbed, was from an adult and there were no preserved intestines.
Police Lt. Gen. Ruangsak Jarit-ake told reporters that all the parts were preserved separately in formaldehyde inside sealed acrylic or plastic boxes. They displayed graphic pictures of all five body parts, which also included two pieces of tattooed skin from an adult — one with a jumping tiger and the other bearing an ancient Asian script. A close-up picture of the baby's foot showed that it had been sliced into three sections.
The method of preservation and the manner in which the parts were cut appeared to be professional and authorities were investigating if the parts were stolen from medical institutes.
In some Thai cults, preserved fetuses or spiritual tattoos are believed to give the owners good fortune or protection from evil. They can also be used to practice black magic.
In 2012, a British citizen was arrested with six roasted fetuses covered in gold leaf after a tip-off that infant bodies were being sold through a website offering black magic service.
At that point, their deal looked remarkably similar to that of their predecessor Mark Richt.
But six months later, the contract Smart signed shows some subtle differences in the employment agreements for the two coaches. And some not so subtle.
Smart's contract — executed in late May — was turned over to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this week in compliance with an opens-record request.
The biggest difference is Smart's contract includes the controversial “conduct and ethics clause.” That condition was a major sticking point for Richt and their representation after they agreed to a raise and new contract in January 2015.
In fact, Richt never signed that deal. So technically they operated under the guidelines of the contract they signed in 2012. Ultimately, though, UGA honored the handshake agreement and paid Richt based on the agreed-upon increased compensation — $4 million – when it fired them Nov. 29.
But while Richt never signed off on that clause, Smart did.
It is essentially a disciplinary clause and it is found in the compensation section of Smart's new contract. It gives Georgia Athletic Association the right to withhold pay from the head coach in the case of a material violation of “one or more of the duties, obligations or expectations … that do not rise to a level warranting termination.”
Call it the “Jack Bauerle Clause.” The legendary swim coach was indefinitely suspended and their pay and bonuses frozen in 2014 while their program was under NCAA investigation for providing extra benefits for a star swimmer. After those charges were substantiated, Bauerle was ordered to repay more than $100,000 in legal fees the athletic association paid to defend the charges.
Financial penalties previously were not spelled out in any coaches contracts. But now they are. Going forward, it is “standard operating procedure” for all of the Bulldogs' head coaches, according to Athletic Director Greg McGarity.
“I'd just say that events that occur around the country often lead to changes in contracts everywhere,” McGarity said. “Things have to be adjusted all the time, not only here but around the country.”
So Smart's contract now states that UGA has “the right to withhold or reduce performance bonuses … and other compensation payable to Smart … by a maximum of 25 percent for up to 12 months.” Furthermore, it states that the athletic association can recommend suspension “with or without pay” for up to one year and recommend that the University “take other disciplinary action.”
Another major difference come in the area of performance bonuses.
The maximum Smart can earn in bonuses for winning SEC and national championships — $1.6 million — is double what Richt's last deal allowed ($800,000). However, McGarity said the same breakdown was included in the deal that Richt never signed.
Also, the buyout structure is markedly different for Smart than it was for Richt.
Smart would owe UGA one year's salary, or $3.75 million, if they resigned after this year, then it is prorated each year thereafter, from $3 million in Year 2 to their base salary of $400,000 in 2021, the final year. Conversely, the Bulldogs would have to pay Smart $13.5 million if they fired them after this season, $10.8 million in 2017, $7.05 million in 2018, and so on. UGA had to pay Richt just $4 million, or 25 percent of their total deal, when it dismissed him.
Meanwhile, the narrative has been that Smart is making fewer public appearances. In reality, according to the “public relations obligations” section of Smart's contract, they will do more PR. However, their requirements are oriented more toward endorsement and fundraising opportunities than those of a pep-rally nature.
Like Richt, Smart must also make “no fewer 12 unpaid personal appearances” before Bulldog Clubs throughout the Southeast and “a reasonable number of appearances” on the Bulldog Hotline and the coaches' many other media platforms. However, Smart must spend at least two days helping the president raise money, make no fewer than 12 annual endorsement appearances for the football program at UGA's request and that any payments for such “university-related appearances be negotiated and kept by the association.”
In addition, Smart must be available for three personal appearance son behalf of Nike or any future equipment provider and up to three appearances on behalf of IMG or any future rights holder.
Smart agreed to these requirements, but with an added caveat: “The Association and University acknowledge and understand that Smart's primary obligation shall be to the serve as the head coach of the University's football team,” and these university-related appearances “shall be subject to their roles of directing the team, including but not limited to its practice, playing and workout schedules and the recruitment of potential student-athletes.”
Smart also included the word “reasonable” to another about complying with the AD's requests for appearances, “subject to Smart's schedule in fulfilling their primary role as head football coach.”
FORMER defence force chief Peter Cosgrove has pleaded for Australia to embrace nuclear power, criticising the "daily scrapping" between politicians about climate change.
Addressing a business breakfast in Perth, General Cosgrove said strong action was crucial and it was "almost immoral" to export uranium to less technologically advanced and stable countries to use in nuclear power plants while refusing to have one in Australia.
"We'll give you the stuff but we won't use it ourselves; I find that difficult to comprehend," they said.

"We're a rich and technologically advanced nation sitting in a geologically stable continent, so surely we can expect to build and operate safely a nuclear power station."
The former Australian of the Year said they anticipated there would be an outcry but there was no cleaner energy source than nuclear power. General Cosgrove declined to give a preference for either Kevin Rudd or Tony Abbott's climate change plans and instead expressed concern the election could dilute their political will.
"The government of the day and the opposition are extraordinarily sensitive to the forthcoming federal election," they said.
"The prism of the election and the need to retain or gain government starts to flavour agenda and actions. The will gets eroded and the intent gets blurred."
They conceded action to combat climate change would be costly and there were no guarantees about the outcome. "I really don't know if all I have been told is true and if we may be at risk of quite catastrophic climate change outcomes during the life of grandkids . . . but I am very uneasy about dicing with their future," they said.
"If at the end of 50 years the last sceptic leaps to their feet on their zimmer frame and says `I told you so' - and we've spent all this money for no great effect - then think of the obverse. Think of the people of Tuvalu now settling into Marrickville, Sydney . . . because their beautiful island is gone."
General Cosgrove suggested a national climate change commission should be established with its own charter and statutory powers to ensure strong and continuous change. "We can't have governments and oppositions daily scrapping over the concerted action we need to take across the national community. We need to start action now to avoid the climate change noose," they said.
General Cosgrove pulled no punches in their speech to the breakfast at the University of Western Australia, which was hosted by major coal producer BHP Billiton.
"If there wasn't a climate change issue then we could burn our coal till the cows come home and we wouldn't need to consider that large step to nuclear energy," they said. "But if we continue to burn our coal prolifically, then it seems to me we haven't taken climate change seriously."

An aerial view of the new church interior view On February 2nd, the feast of Candlemas, Their Excellency Robert Guglielmone, Bishop of Charleston, South Carolina, will dedicate the church of St Mary, Help of Christians , in the city of Aiken. The ceremony will begin at 6 p.m., and be celebrated in the Ordinary Form; the church is located on Fairfield Street, just north of Park Avenue. The parish was founded in 1853, but has now grown to the point where the current church building is completely inadequate to the size of the congregation; the new building has the capacity to seat 1000. The design is entirely the work of McCreary Architects , who provided us with some images of their designs; the project is scheduled to be completed very shortly. We hope to provide images of the dedication ceremony shortly after it takes place; thanks to those who provided us with these images.Fr Gregory Wilson, the pastor of St Mary, has sent in photos of some of the church's furnishing, which I have added below.

The sanctuary lamp was rescued from a closed church in Philadelphia.
A crucifix from a closed church in Belgium will be installed in the church; it is about 70” tall, carved by hand ca. 1870.
The tabernacle is also from Belgium around 1870.
Fr Renaurd West, a priest of the Diocese of Charleston, took these photos back in December; the works have of course advanced considerably since then. In my personal opinion, the mosaic work on the main altar is some of the best of its kind that I have ever seen in a modern church. The architects, designers and clergy involved in this project are much to be commended for a beautiful church in a classical style which embraces and respects the Catholic artistic tradition.The church will also feature a series of twenty decorative medallions by Mrs Alice Judd, each of which is based on a title of the Virgin Mary. These will decorate the roundels in the arcade of the nave, the transepts and the sanctuary.From Fr Wilson: two more of the medallions.
German tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom speaks to the press after appearing in an Auckland courthouse, December 23, 2015. REUTERS/Chris Cameron/Pool Reuters
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Controversial New Zealand-based internet mogul Kim Dotcom plans to launch a Bitcoin payments system for users to sell files and video streaming as they fight extradition to the United States for criminal copyright charges.
The German-born entrepreneur, who is wanted by U.S. law enforcement on copyright and money laundering allegations related to their now-defunct streaming site Megaupload, announced their new venture called 'Bitcontent' in a video posted on Youtube this week.
"You can create a payment for any content that you put on the internet...you can share that with your customers, with the interest community and, boom, you are basically in business and can sell your content," Dotcom said in the video.
They added that Bitcontent would eventually allow businesses, such as news organizations, to earn money from their entire websites. They did not provide a launch date.
Dotcom did not provide details on how Bitcontent would differ from existing Bitcoin operations or how it would help news organizations make money beyond existing subscription payment options.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.
The currency's anonymity has however made it popular with drug dealers, money launderers and organized crime groups, meaning governments and the financial establishment have been slow to embrace it since the first trade in 2009. The currency's value hit record levels in 2017, trading at $1,145 on Wednesday, a fivefold increase in a year, amid growing interest globally.
A New Zealand court ruled in February that Dotcom could be extradited to the United States to face charges relating to their Megaupload website, which was shutdown in 2012 following an FBI-ordered raid on their Auckland mansion, a decision they were appealing.
Dotcom, who has New Zealand residency, became well known for their lavish lifestyle as much as their computer skills.
They used to post photographs of themselves with cars having vanity plates such as "GOD" and "GUILTY", shooting an assault rifle and flying around the world in their private jet.

× Maymont's gray fox Cane passes after 14 years of delighting visitors
RICHMOND, Va. – Maymont's long-time gray fox resident Cane was known for lounging in the sun directly underneath their species identification sign, almost like they were posing for pictures with their title over their head.
Henry “Buz” Bireline, Director of Habitats and the Nature Center at Maymont shared that warm memory of Cane on Tuesday, when they announced that the 14-year-old fox passed away last week.
The long-time resident of the fox habitat had geriatric conditions including significant arthritis in their legs and spine, and they were no longer responding favorably to medical care, Maymont said. Cane was humanely euthanized on Wednesday, Nov. 29.
“Cane was a wonderful ambassador for Virginia wildlife here at Maymont,” Bireline said.
Cane arrived at Maymont as a rescued kit in October 2003 when they were just six months old. Staff said that for well over a decade, Cane was a favorite animal of “school children, photographers, summer campers, guests from near and far, and of course, the Maymont animal keepers and environmental educators.”
Cane actually lived past the maximum life expectancy for a fox in captivity, and in the wild.
Gray foxes in the wild have a life expectancy of one to two years and few live longer than six years, staff said. In captivity, most resources consider the maximum life expectancy to be about 12 years.
“His long life is a great credit to our animal keepers and veterinary staff who have worked hard to give them the best care throughout their life,” said Parke Richeson, Maymont Executive Director. “I'm really going to miss spotting those fuzzy ears peeking up over the wall on my walks among the wildlife habitats.”
Cane was featured as a nocturnal species during night hikes and family camp-outs, and they were selected as the 2006 Animal of the Year through the Animal Appreciation Day program with local schools.
The Maymont staff will be searching for another gray or red fox in need of sanctuary to live in the habitat. That search will be conducted with the Virginia Department of Game & Inland Fisheries, wildlife rescue organizations, zoos, aquariums and other similar institutions.
The Wildlife Exhibits at Maymont still offer unique opportunities to watch the antics of native species including the black bear, bobcat, birds of prey and bison, staff said.
Relations between clergy and media now conform to a silly pattern: clergyman says something perfectly reasonable; media reports that they want to bring back the Inquisition. So Cardinal Burke was taking a big risk when they gave an interview to the New Emangelisation Project (sic) on the subject of gender and the Catholic Church. With striking candour, they bemoaned the influence of feminism on Catholicism – and with grating predictability, the media called them a Neanderthal.
Newspapers like the Independent jumped on their suggestion that feminism took some responsibility for the child abuse scandals because it encouraged a crisis in sexual identity. The Washington Post's Kaya Oakes wrote that the cardinal had an old-fashioned view of gender and was oddly blind to the continued institutional domination of men. And David Gibson, of the Religion News Service, pushed things further with an observation that was cattier than Joan Collins playing Puss-in-Boots: “Burke, a liturgical traditionalist as well as a doctrinal conservative who is renowned for wearing elaborate silk and lace vestments while celebrating Mass, also said that ‘men need to dress and act like men in a way that is respectful to themselves, to women and to children'.” Miaow!
But what did the cardinal really say, and how accurate was it? They argued three things. First, that there's a crisis of Catholic spirituality among men that results in low Mass attendance. Second, that this is partly down to a feminisation of the liturgy. Third, that feminism has also undermined traditional male roles in the family and caused a wider societal crisis. Let's test each hypothesis in turn.
Are men disengaging from the Church? Matthew James Christoff, who runs the New Emangelisation Project, designed to re-evangelise Catholic men, and who conducted the interview with Cardinal Burke, says that male Catholics “have been ignored [by the Church] to some large degree and many have drifted away”. They cite surveys showing that “only a quarter to a third of regular Mass-goers are men and 70 to 90 per cent of roles in parishes are dominated by women”. The fall in male participation obviously translates into a
fall in the numbers pursuing life in the priesthood.
The relative absence of men also has an impact upon the continuation of the faith from one generation to another. A Swiss study by Werner Haug and Phillipe Warner, published in 2000, found that adults take their religious cues far more from the way their fathers behaved during their childhood than the way their mothers did. If a father and mother attend church regularly, 33 per cent of their children will attend church regularly later in life. If a mother attends church regularly and the father irregularly, only two per cent grow up to be regular attendees. But if a father is regular and the mother is irregular, the likelihood of church fidelity actually increases: 38 per cent of their children will become regular churchgoers themselves. If faith in childhood is seen as “something mother likes us to do”, then it doesn't have nearly as much of an impact as if it is “something father insists that we do”.
If Cardinal Burke's assertion that Catholicism has “a man problem” is indisputable, what about their analysis of the causes? When talking casually to friends and priests about the idea that the liturgy had become feminised, I was surprised to find near-universal agreement based on casual observation. Many men admitted that they felt “self-conscious” in a Mass that is all about talking and shaking hands, and celebrating the life of the community. “Note how many men stand with their arms folded, obviously uncomfortable,” one friend confided. “And a lot of them turn up late because they're frightened that if they turn up early they'll be asked to do something inane.”
Joanna Bogle, a Catholic writer who has a personal preference for the modern Rite, laments that the contemporary Mass features “too many women pottering about”. They tend to be “of a certain age – and I happen to be that age as well”, they say, and dominate when it comes to reading or assisting with services. They worry that this means that they are being distracted from other tasks in which women often are far better than men (“teaching, for instance”), while men don't see many roles within the Mass that play to their skills.
The irony, they insist, is that the liturgy that developed after Vatican II actually ought to lend itself to greater understanding of the complementary roles of men and women. “Now we pray aloud and listen,” they say, “and we get to listen to and understand a rich nuptial language of God as the Father, Jesus as their Son, the Church as Mother, and so on.”
Joseph Shaw, chairperson of the Latin Mass Society, disagrees slightly. For him, the post-1960s transformation of the Mass is at the heart of the problem – regardless of its entirely orthodox language. “The kind of liturgy that appeals to men,” they argue, “is one with grandeur.” The Old Rite emphasised the cosmic mystery of Christ, while the new is a celebration of community.
They say: “If you asked the question: ‘Would women enjoy a Mass more that is a celebration of community?' most would answer: ‘That sounds marvellous!' But this ignores the counter-proposition that men might enjoy it much less.”
In other words, everything that attracted women to the New Rite is precisely what alienates the men. And, ironically, one of those changes is the emergence of a greater emphasis upon the personality of the priest – what Cardinal Burke calls the “priest show”. “In many places the Mass became very priest‑centered,” the cardinal explained. “This type of abuse leads to a loss of the sense of the sacred, taking the essential mystery out of the Mass. The reality of Christ Himself coming down on the altar to make present Their sacrifice on Cavalry gets lost.”
Non-Catholic liberals reading this might find some of the language alarming in its assumption that men and women are designed, and naturally inclined, to function in certain gendered ways. But while that might seem like a charmingly nostalgic and abstract principle when talking about liturgy, it takes on real-world meaning when considering what Cardinal Burke had to say about the modern family. “I recall in the mid-1970s,” they said, “young men telling me that they were, in a certain way, frightened by marriage because of the radicalising and self-focused attitudes of women that were emerging at that time. These young men were concerned that entering a marriage would simply not work because of a constant and insistent demanding of rights for women.

Do you wish to secure a new mortgage for your new purchase One Meyer? Perhaps you have wondered just the correct way to get one? Have you ever had troubles being approved in the past and will need to increase your chances in the long run? Using the suggestions below, nearly every possible homeowner could get accepted the following time they apply.
Before attempting to obtain a mortgage approval, find out your credit rating. Mortgage lenders may deny a loan once the borrower has a poor credit score brought on by late payments and other bad credit history. If your credit rating is too low to qualify for a home loan, then clean up your own credit, fix any inaccuracies and make all of your payments on time.
Know your credit score and how that impacts your odds for a home mortgage. Most lenders require a specific credit amount, and if you fall under, you're likely to have a tougher time getting a home loan with reasonable prices. A fantastic idea is that you attempt to increase your credit before you apply for mortgage loan.
Before obtaining a mortgage, study your credit history. Very good credit is what will help you to get a mortgage. Get copies of your credit history and scores from the 3 major credit-reporting bureaus. Study your reports carefully to make certain that no errors or issues must be resolved before you apply. Many lenders require a minimum score of 680, which complies with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae's guidelines. Most lenders want to steer clear of scores that are lower than 620.
Look out for banks offering a”no cost” mortgage loan. There's truly no such thing as”no cost”. The final prices with”no cost” mortgages is rolled into the mortgage loan rather than being due upfront. This means you will be paying interest on the final prices.
Prior to applying for a mortgage, repay your debts. Lenders use a debt to income ratio to confirm that you have the ability to manage a mortgage. A general guideline is 36 percent of your gross income ought to be available to cover all your monthly costs, including your mortgage payment.
Get all of your financial documents in order before speaking to a creditor. Your lender will request a proof of earnings, some bank statements and a few documents in your different financial assets. If you already have these together, the process will be smooth sailing.
Although using money given to you as a gift from relatives to your downpayment is legal, make sure to record that the money is a gift. The lending institution may require a written statement from the donor and documentation about once the deposit into your bank account was created. Have this documentation prepared for your creditor.
Don't take out a mortgage for more than you can comfortably afford to repay. Sometimes lenders provide borrowers a good deal more cash than they want and it is often very tempting because it would help you obtain a bigger house. Decline their offer as it is going to lead you in debt pit you can't get out of.
Keep your job. Lenders look into many facets of your financial situation and one very important aspect is the employment income. Stability is extremely important to lenders. Avoid moving jobs or relocating for as long as possible prior to applying for a house mortgage. This will show them that you're stable.
Lenders look at your debt-to-income ratio so as to decide if you are eligible for a loan. If your total debt is over a certain percentage of your income, you might have difficulty qualifying for a loan. Therefore, lower your debt by paying off your credit cards just as much as possible.
Do not apply for credit and do not cancel present credit cards in the six months prior to applying for a home mortgage. Mortgage brokers are searching for consistency. Whenever you apply for credit, it goes on your credit report. Avoid charging a huge amount during that time and make each payment on time.
Mortgage rates change frequently, so get familiar with the current prices. You'll also need to know what the mortgage rates have been in the recent years. If mortgage rates are climbing, you might choose to secure a loan now instead of later. If the prices are falling, you might opt to wait another month or so before getting your loan.
Do not shut out any credit card balances as you're in the midst of applying for a loan. This will negatively affect you since all your credit cards have been used when determining your eligibility for a loan. If you need to close your account for any reason, wait until the loan procedure is over.
If you have less than perfect credit, 1 way to overcome it is to get a sizable down payment, more than most other borrowers. A great deal of people try saving five or so percent, but twenty percent can actually help you out if what you are trying to do is get approved.
Many lenders now need a house to be inspected before the loan is approved. Although this costs a small sum of money, it can save you tens of thousands of unknown expenses. If the home inspector finds problems with the house, you have the chance to negate the contract or to renegotiate the sales price.
Pay off more than your minimum to your house mortgage each month. Even $20 extra each month can help you pay off your mortgage more quickly with time. Additionally, it will mean less attention costs to you over the years also. If you can afford more, then don't hesitate to pay more.
When searching for a mortgage, you want to comparison shop. Naturally, getting the best interest rate is quite important. Moreover, you want to assess all types of mortgage products. Additionally, you will need to consider closing costs, down payments and every other type of cost that will become involved.
With everything you now know, becoming approved should be a lot simpler than before. Most people can find a mortgage, but they need to be educated to make the best decisions. Fortunately, this guide has demonstrated the ideal way.
Tax is up every year under this government and tax as a percentage of the economy is higher under Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey than it ever was under the previous Labor government despite all of their huffing and puffing about tax. – Chris Bowen, Shadow Treasurer, interview with Hugh Rimington on Channel 10 Eyewitness News, May 12, 2015.
The $A5 billion worth of tax breaks for small business were a centrepiece of the federal budget this year and something the Opposition was keen to frame as a return to Labor policy.
In a post-budget interview, the Shadow Treasurer described corporate tax cuts and lower tax on small business as a good thing, adding that tax as a percentage of the economy is higher now than it was under the previous government.
Is that right?
The available data
According to data in the federal budget papers, Chris Bowen's statement is correct.
They refer to “tax as a percentage of the economy”, which I take to refer to tax receipts as a percentage of GDP. This is indeed a standard measure used in economics to summarise the effective tax burden.
Ideally, Mr Bowen's statement should be checked against independent data sources like the World Bank and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). But unfortunately, international organisations update their databases with a lag of up to two years. (The World Economic Outlook Database of the International Monetary Fund has revenue data up to 2014, plus estimates and projections until 2019 but doesn't distinguish between different levels of government or between tax and non-tax revenues.)
When asked for a data source to substantiate their statement, a spokesperson for Mr Bowen directed The Conversation to the 2015 budget papers.
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 in Statement 4 of Budget Paper 1 of the Federal Budget 2015 report Australian Government receipts in millions of dollars and in percent of GDP. The figures in millions of dollars are comparable to those published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Tax on the rise
The bar chart below, Chart 1, reports the annual tax to GDP ratio from 2008-09 (the first Labor budget) to 2018-19 (last available projection). It must be noted upfront that data for 2014-15 and the two subsequent years are estimates, while data for 2017-18 and 2018-19 are projections.
If one takes 2014-15 as the reference for the first budget year of the Coalition government, then the evidence indicates that tax revenues in proportion of GDP are higher under the Abbott government than under the two previous Labor governments.
Furthermore, the tax-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase steadily over the next four years.
The table below provides some more detailed information on the structure of the tax system. The data are again taken from Supplementary Table 2 of Budget Paper 1.
The most evident change that has occurred between the Labor and Coalition budget periods is the increase in income taxation receipts, while indirect taxes have remained fairly constant.
Within the income taxation category, individual taxes have increased, while receipts from the company tax have been substantially stable. Therefore, it appears that there has been a shift in tax burden to the disadvantage of households.
A few qualifications are necessary. First, being estimates, the data for 2014-15 and subsequent might be revised in the future (but I don't expect these revisions to be significant, at least for 2014-15).
Second, the tax-to-GDP ratio of 21.9% observed in 2014-15 is not the highest ever. Supplementary Table 2 in the budget papers shows that in 2007-08 the ratio was 23.6%. The peak was reached under the Howard government in 2000-01, 2004-05 and 2005-06, when the ratio reached 24.2%. Over the period 1970-71/2014-15 the average ratio was 21.5%.
Third, the data above refer to cash receipts. Accrual receipts in 2014-15 amount to 23.9% of GDP, as shown Supplmentary Table 4 in the budget papers here shows. This is only slightly higher than the accrual receipts to GDP ratio in 2013-14 and 2012-13 (23.7% and 23.6% respectively), but still one to two percentage points higher than the ratio in the earlier years of the Labor governments.
Accrual data also show that tax receipts are expected to increase in the next four years. Therefore, the general picture is qualitatively similar to the one produced from cash basis data.
Verdict
Mr Bowen's statement is correct. Based on available Treasury data, the estimated tax-to-GDP ratio in 2014-15 is the highest since 2008-09. The ratio is also expected to increase further over the next four years. Therefore, the statement of the Shadow Treasurer is true.
Data for 2014-15 and subsequent years are estimates and projections and may be revised in future.
Lastly, it is worth stressing that this verdict does not establish what level of the tax-to-GDP ratio is most appropriate or desirable for the Australian economy.
In fact, lower taxes do not necessarily lead to superior socioeconomic outcomes, essentially because a government that raises little revenue is also a government that can supply little in the way of public goods, services and social welfare.
For this reason, rather than just focusing on how to reduce the tax burden, the policy debate around taxes should be concerned with finding the tax level and structures that best meet the needs of Australian citizens.
Review
I agree with the data reported and its interpretation. The underlying data of Chart 1 and Table 2 is official Australian Treasury data; with important notes that numbers for 2014-15 through 2016-17 are estimates, which will be revised in the future.
It's also noted that data for 2017-18 and 2018-19 are projections which assume no policy changes and a return to long-run economic growth.
The principal reason for the growth of Commonwealth taxation receipts as a share of GDP under the Coalition government is the growth of personal income tax. Every individual whose income in nominal dollars increases faces a higher average tax rate as a result of government failure to index, or to change, the brackets of the personal income tax rate schedule. This effect of so-called “fiscal creep” is in addition to the effect of some people facing higher marginal income tax rates. – John Freebairn

You can't bring up the words “brown paper bag” on a David Simon show—as tonight's episode of The Deuce, “Show And Prove,” does, in reference to Fat Mooney's under-the-counter wares—without also invoking the wise words of the great Howard “Bunny” Colvin.
Advertisement
Colvin's speech acknowledges that if people want something bad enough—be it a bottle of cheap hooch in friendly surroundings or a vial of WMD—they're going to get it; any attempts by police to interfere are a waste of time, energy, and resources. Two episodes in, and it seems like The Deuce has a similar philosophy regarding solicitation and obscenity law. In fact, the vice squad's sex worker round-ups seems to call back to the introduction of Colvin's decriminalized drug zone, the malaprop-ed “Hamsterdam”: The types of offenders that Alston and Flanagan's bosses don't want to see on the street are arrested, processed, and then treated to Chinese takeout and period-appropriate soda pop before they're taken back to the holding cells in order to keep up appearances. This is their brown paper bag for prostitution, though it's not really having the effects the Colvins of the world would prefer: The roll call later in the episode lays out all the murders, rapes, and bodega robberies going ignored while Flanagan is arguing with Ruby about the number of days in April and Mooney's hardcore product is confiscated. Sex U.S.A. is playing down the street, but it has a brown paper bag that works: It's a documentary, so it has artistic value in the eyes of the law.
“Show And Prove” is the next step for various Deuce characters seeking, if not to go entirely legit, than to at least find a brown paper bag of legitimacy. Porn and cheesecake might just deliver Ashley and Shay from one exploitative prick to another, but it's also work that would get them off of the street and out of the rain. In line with Candy's overriding independent streak—if their son's going to get an Operation game, it's going to be bought with their money—her attempt to break into this game isn't going to depend on the people who Mooney doesn't know (wink wink) or any Campbell's-slinging basement pornographers. She's going to learn how to do it herself, the Hollywood dreams tacked to the walls of their childhood bedroom manifesting in an entrepreneurial curiosity about lighting rigs and a reel of smuggled smut.

In that moment, Maggie Gyllenhaal gets to show the wheels turning in Candy's mind; in similar “Show And Prove” scenes for Vince, the script does the thinking before James Franco gets a chance to register it. On a pure, writing level, I'm not sure where I stand on the runaway-freight-train momentum of the good Martino son's storyline. In the course of two episodes, he's completely reinvented House Of Korea's business model and he's brokered a potentially lucrative payroll scheme that makes their brother-in-law (Chris Bauer as Bobby, a construction supervisor from a time when we used to make shit in this country) happy and help can cover Frankie's debts. The mafia capo who's fronting the payroll money, Rudy Pipilo (Michael Rispoli) is so impressed with Vinnie's work that he's offering them ownership (with certain financial obligations to Rudy, of course) of the dying gay bar Penny Lane.
Frankly, it's a lot of ground to cover in such a short amount of time, especially when so much of the rest of the show is preceding much more patiently. Even in the bigger-they-come, harder-they-fall world of crime narratives, poising Vinnie for a third business smash doesn't seem to gibe with, say, this week's incremental Abbey scenes, in which they leaf the dorms, finds an apartment, and looks at the classifieds, and that's it. There are only eight episodes in season one, so a certain amount of narrative economy is to be expected, but maybe the show could put some gloves on Vinnie's Midas touch for a bit? (Then again, that'd only turn those gloves to gold, too, so…)
These rapid developments are interesting on a thematic and character level, though. They're complications of Vinnie's moral code, of the characteristics that kept them working two jobs on opposite sides of the river out of a distaste for organized crime. They raise the questions you want to be raised by this type of story, the “How far will this go?”s and the “Who do they owe?”s that make things exciting down the line. As Vinnie compromises to stay afloat, does it blur the lines dividing them from their brother? “I thought you hated all those fucking made guys” Franco slurs at themselves in the red-neon haze of House Of Korea, speaking for anyone who might have thought, with as quickly as things have been coming together, that they've already learned all there is to know about Vincent Martino.

Because that's the thing about The Deuce at this point: We're still getting the lay of the land. There's an informational tour of sorts in tonight's scenes between C.C. and Lori, which provide the spine of “Show And Prove” while showing off the ugly underpinnings of the show's world. (It's smartly, smoothly plugged in to other portions of the episode, too: The “I bet I could do what they do” Jane Fonda chitchat connecting to Candy's plot, the theater conversation illuminating the raid of Fat Mooney's.) The Deuce continues to use Lori as an effective audience surrogate, Emily Meade's know-it-all nonchalance continually upended by C.C.'s unpredictable behavior. She's no naïf, but they don't exactly expect to see a man get stabbed, either. Like Vinnie's ethics, like the theoretical love C.C. espouses and the actual, sinister control they practice, it's all a matter of degrees.
As its characters make moves to improve their stations, “Show And Prove” offers differing opinions about whether or not they can have any lasting impact on their worlds. Surveying the neighborhood after their first meeting at House of Korea, Rudy gives the outsider's impression of The Deuce, an urban-improvement lament/gentrifier's thesis about vacant buildings and wasted potential. The whole thing is laced with dramatic irony, considering what became of the area, how efforts to make it more friendly to people like the family at the diner (whose son is so distracted by Gentle Richie), at the expense of people like Ruby (whom Vinnie and Rudy pass in one of those ships-passing-in-the-night world-building moments The Deuce does so well), and to the benefit of business person (legitimate or otherwise) like Rudy. “Stagnant around here. Got to get the water moving again” they tell Vinnie.
And then there's the crack from Rodney that leads Alston to expand the scope of the evening round-up at the end of the episode: “Like sweeping leaves on a windy day.” When Darlene visits Fat Mooney earlier in “Show And Prove,” they speak about the criminal nature of their respective lines of work in similarly mocking tones; the police are never going to deter people from paying to have sex or from paying to see people have sex. It's a compassionate approach (though even Alston has their limits), but it's also a brown paper bag that blows away every 48 hours.

Stray observations
New character alert: Natalie Paul as Sandra Washington, the apparent reporter who approaches Darlene while she's reading at House Of Korea. “You heard of oral histories?” they ask as Larry gets in between them and Darlene—and I'm guessing this isn't the last we've heard from Sandra.
The Jane Fonda movie Lori and C.C. discuss is Klute, in which Fonda won an Academy Award for playing Bree Daniels, a prostitute working for themselves in New York City.
“Show And Prove” continues to color in the outlines of The Deuce with the ongoing, profane-and-prejudiced athletic chatter between detectives Grossman (Brian Muller) and Haddix (Ralph Macchio). “I don't even know what fucking sport you're talking about” is an early contender for line of the season.
“Not underwear—leotards.” Vinnie is all about the minor distinctions.
Gary Carr's delivery of these parting words to Lori just killed me: “Ever been to France? No? Well me neither.”
Parting words that sting in a different way: “You happen to remember where they put the cuff keys?”
Free, all-purpose excuse from the final scene: “I ain't working, I was just going to get an Orange Julius.”
Neutrinos have been caught shape-shifting in a way no one has seen before, a particle experiment has confirmed. Delayed for years by the magnitude-9 earthquake that rocked Japan in March 2011, the result is an early step towards figuring out why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe, and possibly opens the door to new physics.
Notoriously shifty particles, neutrinos are nearly massless and scarcely interact with other particles, slipping like ghosts through kilometres of rock. They are also masters of disguise that come in three flavours – electron, muon and tau – and are believed to be able to flip-flop between these types without warning in a process called oscillation.
The problem is, most experiments measure the rate of neutrino oscillation by starting with one neutrino type and seeing how many of them disappear by the time the particles reach a detector, rather than seeing the transformed neutrino arrive anywhere. For example, until 2011, no one had seen any solid signs of muon neutrinos turning into electron neutrinos.
The T2K experiment in Japan generates a beam of muon neutrinos at the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, near Japan's east coast. It sends them 295 kilometres to the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector in Kamioka, on the west coast. In 2011 the team saw the first hint of the transformation, but the 2011 megaquake temporarily shut down the experiment before it could confirm the sighting.

Antimatter mystery
Now, with about four times as much data, T2K is finally able to claim certainty. They have detected a total of 28 electron neutrinos, when fewer than 5 would be expected if the neutrinos were not oscillating. Odds that the result is a fluke are less than one in a trillion. The team announced the results today at the European Physical Society meeting in Stockholm, Sweden.
Previously, this type of neutrino oscillation was only indicated, says David Wark of the Science and Technology Facilities Council in the UK, and a member of the T2K collaboration. “Now it counts as a discovery.”
The result offers a path towards solving one of the biggest mysteries in physics: why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. Standard theories say that matter and antimatter should have been created in equal amounts by the big bang. But for some reason, matter won out.
Particle surprise
Now that we have seen the muon neutrino morph into the electron neutrino in normal matter, physicists can run the T2K experiment with a beam of anti-muon neutrinos. Subtle differences in the way neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate could have skewed the ratios of matter and antimatter production in the early universe. “This is the first step along the way, but it proves that we're going to get there,” says Wark.
The measurement is also interested in its own right, says Janet Conrad of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a member of the Double Chooz neutrino experiment in Chooz, France. Since 2011 that detector and other “disappearance” experiments have seen indirect signs of the muon-electron shift.
Comparing T2K's results to the disappearance data can directly point the way to new laws of physics beyond our current understanding. “If we see inconsistencies, it means there are new physics going on,” says Conrad. “Neutrinos always surprise us, so this is an exciting opportunity to see what more these particles may have to say.”

Service trade and productivity
Masayuki Morikawa
World trade in services is increasing rapidly but micro evidence remains scarce. This column employs firm data from Japan to argue that service-exporting firms are more productive than non-exporting firms and goods-exporting firms. Information asymmetry, transportation costs, differences in institutions, cultures, and languages increase the fixed costs of service trade. Therefore, highly productive firms are more likely to self-select into service trade.
According to WTO statistics, world exports of services grew by 8% per annum between 1980-2013, exceeding the exports of goods (which grew at 7% per annum). The ratio of service exports relative to goods exports increased from 18% in 1980 to 24.7% in 2013. In 2013, Japan ranked fourth in export of goods and eighth in export of services, with annual growth rate of service exports (6.4% from 1980 to 2013) exceeding that of goods exports (5.3%). These numbers indicate a relatively low presence of Japan in the world service trade.
However, studies on service trade have lagged far behind those on goods trade, mainly due to the limited availability of good statistical data (see Francois and Hoekman 2010 for a survey). Particularly, empirical evidence on service trade using firm- or establishment-level micro data has been scarce.
As most services are distinguished by simultaneity of production and consumption, the transaction usually requires proximity between suppliers and consumers. Thus, the geographical distance matters more than in the transaction of goods. Cultural and institutional distances may impose an additional burden on service trade. In contrast to goods trade where tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have been substantially reduced through multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, a large number of services are still subject to public regulations. Given that regulations and standards imposed on services differ markedly by country, the barrier to crossing a national border is higher for service trade than it is for goods trade (e.g., Miroudot et al. 2013).
Firm heterogeneity in service trade
During the last decade, theoretical international trade studies on the heterogeneity of firms have advanced rapidly. Paralleling the theoretical development, a large number of empirical studies on international trade and foreign direct investments using firm- or establishment-level data has been accumulated. These studies demonstrated that there is a strong positive relationship between globalising activity and the productivity of the firms (see Greenaway and Kneller 2007, Wagner 2007, 2012, Bernard et al. 2012 for surveys).
However, the vast majority of the extant empirical studies that employ micro data have dealt solely with goods trade. The rare firm-level studies that conduct a separate analysis of service trade include Breinlich and Criscuolo (2011) on UK firms, Kelle et al. (2013) on German firms, Haller et al. (2014) on firms in four EU countries, and Malchow-Møller et al. (forthcoming) on Belgian firms. However, all of these studies analyse firms in EU countries. In particular, UK firms are exceptional in the world service trade because the UK is the third largest service exporting country, and the ratio of service exports relative to goods exports is very high (54.0% in 2013). Other studies mentioned herein also analyse firms in EU countries where goods/services market integration is advanced. From the service trade perspective, these countries differ greatly in economic circumstances from non-EU countries such as Japan or the US.
To deepen our understanding on this issue, we empirically investigated the relationship between service trade and various firm characteristics in comparison with that of goods trade using a large panel data of Japanese firms (see Morikawa 2015 for more detail). The data are from the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities (BSJBSA) by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry for the period 2009-2012. The Basic Survey is a compilation of representative government statistics on all Japanese firms with 50 or more regular employees engaged in manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service industries, and approximately 30,000 firms are surveyed every year. We perform a simple regression analysis to explain the total factor productivity (TFP), whereby the dummies for goods/service trading firms are used as key explanatory variables.
We hypothesise, first, that the effect of firm productivity on self-selection into international service exports is stronger than the effect on goods exports.
Our second hypothesis is that the size and productivity of service exporters with non-affiliate firms is higher than those with only affiliate firms and that the difference is more pronounced in service exports than goods exports.
Service exporters' productivity premium
According to our regression results, the TFP level of service exporting firms is significantly higher than that of domestic (non-exporting) firms and goods exporting firms. Exporters' productivity premiums relative to non-exporters are 13.8% for pure goods exporters, 19.9% for pure service exporters, and 21.3% for firms exporting both goods and services (see Figure 1). These results differ from the findings of past studies for EU countries. For example, according to Breinlich and Criscuolo's (2011) study on UK firms, the productivity differences of service exporters and goods exporters are small and statistically insignificant. Haller et al. (2014) find that labour productivity of service exporters in four EU countries is not necessarily higher than that of goods exporters.
In comparison to EU countries, the development of service trade by Japanese firms is lagging. We interpret the results to suggest that only productive firms can engage in service trade due to geographical, linguistic, and institutional distances from foreign countries.

Notes: The figure is drawn from an OLS regression result using the BSJBSA data for the fiscal years 2009-2012. The reference category is the non-exporting firms. Control variables are firm size (log employees), year dummies, and three-digit industry dummies.
Next, we divide goods/service exporting firms into those that export only to their overseas affiliates (intra-firm exporters) and those that export to non-affiliate firms (inter-firm exporters), and we then investigate the differences in productivity between the subsamples. The TFP of inter-firm service exporters is significantly higher than those firms that export services only to their affiliate firms (see Figure 2).
This result suggests that highly productive firms tend to self-select into service exporting beyond the boundary of the firms.

Notes: The figure is drawn from an OLS regression result using the BSJBSA data for the fiscal years 2009-2012. The reference category is the non-exporting firms. Control variables are firm size (log employees), year dummies, and three-digit industry dummies.
Summary and conclusion
To summarise, our findings indicate that fixed costs to initiate service trade exceed those to initiate goods trade. This is possible due to the information asymmetry in evaluating the quality of services, the high transportation costs, and the differences in institutions, cultures, and languages. We conjecture that policies to liberalise and facilitate service trade may play a more important role in globalising firm activities than do policies for goods trade.

The belief that the wealthy are worthy is waning
With financial crisis and scandal as backdrop, Americans are questioning whether plutocrats are either indispensable or deserving.
That mind-set has all but been eradicated by the damage sustained by the average worker's nest egg, combined with the spectacle of bankers and financial engineers maintaining their lifestyles with multimillion-dollar bonuses while the submerged 99% struggle for oxygen.
Americans consistently supported fiscal policies that undermined middle- and working-class interests partially because they saw themselves as rich-people-in-waiting: Given time, toil and the magic of compound interest, anyone could retire a millionaire.
That the point is even open for discussion suggests that a sea change is taking place on the American political scene. For decades, the wealthy have been held up as people to be admired, victors in the Darwinian economic struggle by virtue of their personal ingenuity and hard work.
The financial crisis of the present day raises a rather different issue, however: What should we do about the rich?
The notion that the poor always will be with us has been ingrained in our culture ever since the sermons of Moses were set down by the anonymous author of Deuteronomy.
(The price of admission to the top 1% income-earning club last year was roughly $400,000.) That may account for the near-total absence of public outcry over President Obama's proposal to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans -- except of course from the wealthiest Americans.
One factor fueling the public fury over the AIG bonuses, so inescapably in the news this week, is the recognition that so many huge fortunes landed in the hands of the undeserving rich. Some of them added little value to the economy but merely moved money around in novel, excessively clever and ultimately destructive ways; others are corporate executives who were ridiculously overpaid whether they succeeded or failed at their jobs.
It won't be long now, moreover, before Americans again wise up to the role of dumb luck in building wealth. By my count, roughly one-quarter of the names on the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans got there by inheritance (and by no means have all of them enhanced the family fortune with their own toil or brainpower). A few years ago, it was common to think of the rich as a special breed. We may soon come around to George Orwell's view that the only difference between rich and poor is income -- "The average millionaire," as they put it, "is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit."
The shift in sentiment should surprise no one. As the management sage Peter Drucker once predicted, "In the next economic downturn there will be an outbreak of bitterness and contempt for the super-corporate chieftains who pay themselves millions. In every major economic downturn in U.S. history the 'villains' have been the 'heroes' during the preceding boom." Drucker was speaking in 1997, two downturns ago.
This brings us to a couple of questions certain to become more pressing as we stagger through the fiscal and economic hangover from the Roaring Oughty-Oughts: How much does our economy depend on the rich, anyway, and why shouldn't we soak them good?
A bit of history will be useful here. The original case for a progressive income tax -- that is, one levied disproportionately on larger incomes -- was based less on raising revenue for the state than breaking up concentrations of wealth, inherited and otherwise. The nation's Founding Fathers considered these to be undemocratic -- markers of "an aristocratic society, not a free and virtuous republic," as the tax-law expert Dennis Ventry has written.
Recent events validate the Founders' instincts. The craze for financial deregulation in Washington was fomented in part by Wall Street plutocrats brandishing lavish political donations, gifts, offers of employment and other trappings of economic power. Would Wall Street have gotten so far out of control if it had had less power to wield? No one can know for sure, but it's a question worth pondering.
