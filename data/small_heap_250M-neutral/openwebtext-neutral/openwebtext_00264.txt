Roman preparation
In late 135 BC, the Roman Senate reappointed Scipio consul on popular demand and sent them to Hispania to finish what lesser generals had failed to complete. Scipio found morale low among the troops stationed in Iberia. The chance of plunder being low, there were few enticements to enlistment. Scipio nevertheless raised an army of 20,000 with 40,000 allied and mercenary troops, especially Numidian cavalry led by Jugurtha. The troops were trained hard by constant marching and there were several successful skirmishes before Scipio began to surround the city of Numantia itself. They planned only to starve it out and not to storm it.
Siege works
Scipio's army constructed two camps separated by a wall around the city (circumvallation). They dammed the nearby swamp to create a lake between the city walls and their own. From ten feet off the ground, their archers could shoot into Numantia from seven towers interspersed along the wall. They also built an outer wall to protect their camps (eventually five in total) from any relief forces (contravallation). Scipio also engineered the isolation of the city from the Duero. They towered the river at the points where it entered and exited the city and strung a cable across, with blades, to prevent both boats and swimmers from leaving or entering the city.
Counterattack
The Numantines attempted one failed sally before their greatest warrior, Rhetogenes, successfully led a small band of men down the river past the blockade. Heading first to the Arevaci, their pleas were ignored. They then went to Lutia, where they were positively received by the youth, but the elders of the tribe warned Scipio, who marched from Numantia and arrested the 400 Lutian youths and cut off their hands. After Scipio's return, Avarus, the Numantine leader, began negotiations.
Surrender
The first ambassadors sent by Numantia asked for their liberty in return for complete surrender, but Scipio refused. They were killed upon return by the incredulous populace, who believed they had cut a deal with the Romans. The city refused to surrender and starvation set in. Cannibalism ensued and eventually some began to commit suicide with their whole families. The remnant population finally surrendered only after setting their city on fire. Scipio took it and had its ruins levelled. This was late in the summer of 133.
Legacy
The siege of Numantia was recorded by several Roman historians that admired the sense of freedom of the ancient Iberians and acknowledged their fighting skills against the Roman legions. Miguel de Cervantes (author of Don Quixote) wrote a play about the event, La Numancia, which stands today as their most well-known dramatic work. More recently, Carlos Fuentes has written a short story about the event, "The Two Numantias," in their collection The Orange Tree. In 2017, the Spanish authorities organized a commemoration of the 2150th anniversary of the siege.[2]

Update 1/30: As of 6pm ET on Friday evening, just 100 tickets are listed on the secondary market with an average price of $11,565.14 and a get-in price of $7,000.
Over the last 49 years, the Super Bowl has become a literal and figurative peak for American commercialism to aspire to. While it was decidedly not larger than life in the early years, it has become the biggest, most extravagant event in America. Being the ‘Super Bowl' of something means you're the biggest and best that you can be in your chosen field of work or life. Over the last 25 years, that superlative designation has been thrown about for so many events, in fact, that it has lost most of it's meaning.
This year, however, it has made a meta-comeback in the ticket world. When this year's Super Bowl is played and done, regardless of who wins, it will likely be the Super Bowl of all Super Bowls -- the most expensive NFL championship ever based on ticket resale prices.
The current average list price for Super Bowl XLIX tickets at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., is $6,103.07, making it the most expensive Super Bowl that TiqIQ has ever tracked. That average is 102% more expensive than it was at the same point one year ago. Last year on the day of the game, the secondary market average was $2,500 and you could likely get in the stadium for closer to $1,000. This year, the cheapest ticket will likely be triple that, and the average will almost certainly close above $5,000, which would make it the most expensive Super Bowl—or any other event-- since we started tracking the market back in 2010.
Below is a chart, by day, of the last six Super Bowls and the average price by day for each. As you can see, 2015 had done nothing but move up until Monday, which could be the start of a price decline heading into the game. With it's almost vertical climb in the last two days, this year's game is still literally off the chart - or at least redefining the upper limits of the chart.
For fans looking to get a ticket, it's important to be aware that upper level tickets are actually MORE expensive than lower level tickets. As counterintuitive as that sounds, it's an economic inversion caused in large part by over-selling ‘speculative' upper level tickets last week. Speculative selling means that brokers sold a ticket that they did not have in their possession, and were making a bet on the market based on historical patterns much like the ones illustrated above.
Unfortunately for those professional ticket sellers (and buyers), there is now a shortage of tickets in the upper levels relative to years past. That means that a fan that purchased a ‘Section/Row TBD' Upper Level seat the Sunday of the conference championships paid as low as $1,900. The best deal on the market as of 3pm one week later is $4,200.
As for what could happen going forward, The University of Phoenix Stadium's history may be the best guide. In 2010, the National Championship between Auburn and Oregon also broke the $5,000 average price mark, and to this day remains the only other event above $5,000 that we've ever seen. The cheapest ticket on game day that year was $2,750. The peak average price for that game came five days out at an average price of $5,906. This year's peak (so far) is about 10% higher than that. That year, the cheapest ticket dropped 36% from it's peak five days before the game. If that were to happen this year, the cheapest ticket available on game day would be around $2,800. Given that, $3,000 is a good mark to shoot if you just want to ‘get in'.
Whether or not fans end up getting in for $3,000–ish will depend on when the market stops going up. For the latest update on the cheapest tickets on the market, visit TiqIQ's XLIX Super Bowl page.
In 2011, Amber & Tom married. They were pronounced husband and wife, but something just didn't feel right. Fast forward 6 years, they remarried. Pronounced wife and wife, Amber & Natalie have battled through transitioning to become a couple that is stronger than ever.
They met online, and after date number two, they were hooked. For Amber, it was the very first time in their life that when they thought forward to their future, they could see someone else there.
They wed, as Amber and Tom in 2011 surrounded by friends a family and a whole tonne of Ikea lights. At one point, the couple got up on stage with their ukulele band to perform, and they ended the night cutting the cake with a sword and walking out to ‘We Are The Champions'.
But, there was something that still wasn't quite right.
For as long as Natalie can remember, they never felt like they fit in. They would dream of waking up a girl but never thought that it would be possible. Growing up in the 80's & 90's, the social consciousness of the transgendered community was pretty negative meaning that those feelings were internalised for a long time.
“It wasn't until I was in my early 30's that I started to be able to work past that and accept who I was.”
For Natalie, coming out to Amber was the hardest thing that they had to do. They told them as they were settling in for sleep. Amber's response at that moment was “okay”, but after a few days questions started to arise “what do you mean by that?”, “when did you realise this?”, “what does this mean for us?”, “what happens in this process” and “what do you want?”.
Being open and honest has been central to overcoming their obstacles. Amber identified as a straight before Natalie's transition and has found themselves grieving for the former person but opened arms to the real person.
“One thing that was very important to me knows that Natalie gets to be herself, and become who they truly are. In that respect, it wasn't hard: I was thrilled that they were discovering who they were and getting to discover a new world.”
For Natalie, their feelings for Amber never changed, however, although Amber still loved Natalie things had changed.
“I couldn't say “Yes, for always, whatever happens,” because I didn't know how I would feel as they entered the world as a woman, and we entered as a lesbian couple.”
Taking things one day at a time, Natalie began hormone replacement therapy, and small changes started. They began shopping for a new wardrobe, told family and friends, and Natalie started to be themselves every day.
In July of 2016, Natalie proposed again. A conscious decision to continue to grow together, as a couple.
“It seemed fair for Amber to really get to make a choice, once we had kind of come out on the other side.”
They renewed their vows as two women in love in 2017. Amber wore a white dress, while Amber wore a suit for the occasion. It wasn't the plan, but after they saw Natalie try on wedding gowns and saw how much they glowed, they wanted to let Natalie have that experience of being a bride that they had already had. Amber was also conscious of not perpetuating the hetero-normative idea that you have to be a bride and groom and felt their outfit were the perfect combination of minimal but still keeping some femininity and appeal.
Life has become simpler for the couple in a lot of ways. Their relationship is stronger than ever thanks to strong communication between them. And, as with any couple, “of course it's not always sunshine and rainbows – anyone who tells you that marriage is they are probably lying. We're growing and figuring out who we are as a couple and how to exist in this world together, and it's a beautiful journey”.

Portugal's prime minister said they will address the nation Sunday over a crisis triggered when the country's highest court ruled some of the unpopular pay cuts in this year's budget are unlawful, depriving the government of about 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion) of expected revenue.
Pedro Passos Coelho will speak after their government said in a statement that the position taken by the Constitutional Court "places the country in serious difficulties in meeting obligations to which it is committed internationally and also the budgetary goals it must meet."
Passos Coelho met with President Anibal Cavaco Silva late Saturday after holding an emergency Cabinet meeting.
The government accepted the judges' decision, "but disagreed with it," government spokesperson Luis Marques Guedes said. They said the ruling carries risks which Portuguese citizens should be made aware of.
The court's decision Friday delivered a setback to the austerity strategy agreed between the government and foreign creditors who lent Portugal 78 billion euros ($101.5 billion) in a bailout two years ago.
The ruling, delivered by a panel of 13 judges, said budget measures which cut holiday pay for government workers and pensioners, and other austerity cutbacks which reduce unemployment and sickness benefits, were unconstitutional.
The court's reasoning was that the measures singled out public workers and pensioners and hence were contrary to equality guarantees written into Portugal's constitution. Private sector workers aren't subject to the measures.
Esteban Gonzalez Pons of neighboring Spain's ruling Popular Party was at pains to say that "Spain is not in the situation as Portugal," because austerity efforts had been distributed more evenly and "everyone has had to make sacrifices."
Spain's main trade unions in January lodged an appeal before the Constitutional Court to similar cutbacks ushered through parliament by the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.

It appears, meteorologist Casey Curry and KTRK-TV have unceremoniously parted ways after 11 years on the weather wall.
Back in August, TV insider blog FTVLive reported ABC 13 was planning to hire meteorologist Collin Myers from Austin's KEYE-TV for a weekend morning position. Elita Loresca, who was already the weekend morning meteorologist, was bumped up to the 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. newscasts.
Obviously that presents a problem since Curry was working those hours.

Monday, they told Chron.com their contract was "up" and had left the station. Later that afternoon, they co-hosted "Houston Life" on KPRC-TV with Derrick Shore.
Prior to KTRK, Curry worked for Denver's KWGN-TV and Chicago's CLTV. Viewers may even remember they did a few stints with ABC's "Good Morning America" while they were still with 13.

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, who had previously said their criticisms of the federal government's handling of Hurricane Maria relief were about saving lives and “not about politics,” took a shot at President Donald Trump by wearing a shirt that read “NASTY” on it during a Univision interview.
When asked by host Jorge Ramos what the significance of their “nasty” shirt was, the mayor said it was a reference to Trump referring to them as a “nasty mayor.” The interview was posted Wednesday to Univision's AlPunto Twitter account.
They went on to claim that Trump was the one who is “nasty.”

Kansas City mayor Sly James estimated that 800,000 people turned out to watch the Royals' championship parade (at least one police sergeant thought it was higher), which is even more impressive when you realize that Kansas City's population is just 470,000. But while it's one thing to hear a number like 800,000, it's quite another to see it.
And these are just partial shots of those that stuck around after the parade to hear players like Jonny Gomes speak. The zoomed out shot of this crowd is staggering.

The Royals' 2.3 mile-long parade route, snaking north and then south through downtown, was packed 15-to-20 deep on both sides, as seen in this video.
Just for good measure, here are a few more great shots from the festivities.

Schools located inside gated communities are pretty common in the Philippines. You have the likes of Xavier School (Greenhills) and Colegio San Agustin (Dasmariñas Village) providing education to children from non-resident families. And therein lies the problem: Because many students of these schools live outside the subdivision where their school is located, they require hundreds of cars to transport them every day--hundreds of cars that converge in a single venue, obviously resulting in a traffic nightmare that village residents have no choice but to live with.
At some point, said village residents will take action. That is the case now in Ayala Alabang, where the Ayala Alabang Village Association has notified De La Salle Santiago Zobel that the village will implement a color-coding scheme for the school's non-resident students starting February 2 (Monday), 2015. DLSZ is located on University Avenue inside Ayala Alabang. The school was established in March 1978 and opened in June of that same year, which means DLSZ has been operating in that place for nearly 36 years.
Continue reading below ↓
Because of the worsening traffic inside the village--which many homeowners attribute to the vehicles of non-resident DLSZ students--AAVA has decided to adopt a traffic-reduction scheme. The proposed color-coding scheme works this way:
* Two colored stickers (green and white) will be distributed to the non-resident families of the school's students. Without one of these stickers, a non-resident vehicle may not enter the village through the Madrigal gate;
* Those with white stickers can enter the gate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays;
* Those with green stickers can enter the gate on Tuesdays and Thursdays;
* School buses and school service vehicles are exempt from this color-coding scheme;
* Non-resident vehicles may enter the gate after 6pm, regardless of their sticker color;
* Each non-resident family may get only one sticker color. So even if a non-resident family has two cars, they are stuck with one color-coding schedule (either M/W/F or T/Th).
As you can imagine, vehement objections started flying after the notification letter was sent to the school last December 16. Non-resident parents are asking, first, why this has to be introduced within the school year, and second, why this will be implemented without a proper dialogue and in spite of the school's many efforts in reducing vehicular traffic in the area.
On December 16, 2014, AAVA president Epifanio Joaquin wrote this to the school (in italics):
The root cause of the traffic problem has been identified; it is the increased number of students enrolled in DLSZ who are not residents of Ayala Alabang Village, without foresight or regard for the ensuing traffic and pollution implications that would be created. The current DLSZ population is 4,300 students, and about 70% or over 3,000 of which are non-residents.
Continue reading below ↓
This number of non-resident students require some 1,200 vehicles to ferry them to the school. Since it appears that this number will only increase over time, the board of governors has agreed that the only way to reduce the number of vehicles ferrying students is for DLSZ to provide more school buses and require carpooling among the students. With this number of 1,200 cars ferrying outsiders into the village, we started trying alternatives early in the year with the goal of reducing this number to 800 vehicles by end of November 2014. While the number went down to over 1,000 by September, it went up again to over our starting base of 1,200 by October.
Despite the implementation of a busing system and the so-called "efforts" of DLSZ to encourage students to carpool, the number of vehicles has recently increased to 1,787. The problem has actually worsened. This result simply proves that the parents of the students have prioritized their convenience over the welfare of the affected homeowners, and are not cooperating with AAVA and the DLSZ administration.
The AAVA Board has given you immeasurable leeway since April 2014 to try all possible means to reduce the volume of vehicles ferrying students into DLSZ. However, we feel that the school's management has not exerted the required effort to encourage and compel the parents of your students to share the burden of sacrifice to reach the desired goal of reducing vehicle volume within the village for the mutual benefit of the students and the residents of the village.
Continue reading below ↓
While we are more than willing to accommodate DLSZ students to enter the village and receive a good education, our hospitality has to be reciprocated by a real and concerted effort on the part of the school's administration, student body and parents to preserve the welfare and well-being of our residents who are affected by the volume of cars and students regularly entering the village. The AAVA feels that there is a lack of genuine desire on the part of DLSZ to create change that will improve the situation. The product of this indifference is the continued suffering of residents from the nuisance, pollution, congestion, noise, traffic and the risk to life and limb posed by the sheer number of vehicles within the village, some of whom have blatantly disregarded traffic regulations imposed by the AAVA. We have been extraordinarily patient during the last eight months. However, we need to see results.
DLSZ president Brother Bernard Oca issued a reply dated December 26, 2014 (in italics):
We strongly disagree with the statement in your letter that the traffic situation in Ayala Alabang Village has "worsened." We dispute your count that the vehicles that enter the village have increased to "1,787."
Based on our last count on November 25, 2014, the number of school-bound vehicles entering all gates of the village from 6am to 8am was at 1,233. The most number of vehicles that entered the village at one time was pegged at 455, and these vehicles entered the village between 6:30am and 7am. Certainly, there has been a remarkable improvement in the traffic flow around the school perimeter through our efforts in 2014.
Continue reading below ↓
Based on our records, and pursuant to our undertaking, we have complied with your request to keep our student population below 4,200. Presently, there are only 4,188 students enrolled in our school, contrary to your claim of 4,300.
We believe that it will be in the best interest of the village to continue addressing our concerns in a multilateral approach. Moreover, as you are aware, the following measures have already been implemented by De La Salle Zobel to improve the flow of traffic along Madrigal and University Avenue:
* April to June 2014 - Widening of school gates and inner roads to accommodate entry of vehicles and ease the flow of traffic (cost: P4.25 million);
* June 2014 to present - Hiring of additional 10 guards to manage traffic in the morning and in the afternoon (cost P100,000 a month);
* September 2014 - Changing of class schedule for the high school, from 7:30am to 8:00am, to lessen the bulk of incoming vehicular traffic in the morning and in the afternoon;
* September 2014 - Hiring of traffic management consultants to study the situation and give professional recommendations to ease the traffic;
* October 13-23, 2014 - Hiring of additional two tourist buses for the experimental bus-ferrying of high school students from ATC to DLSZ and back to lessen also the bulk of incoming vehicular traffic in the morning and in the afternoon (cost: P194,000); and
* December 2014 - Sending out a survey to parents to gather data needed in preparation for the clustering of school bus providers and carpoolers.
Thus, there is no basis for your statement that DLSZ "lacks the genuine desire to create change that will improve the situation." In truth, DLSZ has implemented and incurred unbudgeted expenses to better the flow of traffic in the village.
Continue reading below ↓
It is also not true that "parents have prioritized their convenience over the welfare of the affected homeowners." Certainly, it is the safety and security of the children that is our utmost priority. Moreover, the village must also consider that DLSZ is, as every homeowner, also a lot owner that pays its association dues every year. For 2014 alone, the school paid a total of P943,579.20.
The AAVA Board's decision to implement the color-coding system by 2 February 2015 comes at a time when we are still finalizing the carpooling and clustering system of our school bus providers. We are still actively finalizing these carpooling and clustering systems again in pursuit of our common goal to minimize the number of vehicles entering the village. In view of the foregoing, we hope that you would reconsider your decision on the color-coding scheme, and suspend its implementation especially since a haphazard implementation thereof may pose serious risks to the health and safety of our students. DLSZ looks forward to continuing our service to the village as it has been doing for 36 years.
As you read this, the AAVA has not relented. The color-coding scheme is still set to be implemented on February 2, which is really worrying parents of DLSZ's non-resident students.
A group of concerned parents from the DLSZ Parents Association has reached out to TopGear.com.ph and informed us that they are launching a social-media campaign to raise awareness of the issue. They have even created a hashtag for the campaign: #JusticeForDLSZKids. There is now a plan to conduct a "prayer rosary walk" with the students on Tuesday, January 27, at 3pm.
Continue reading below ↓
"De La Salle Zobel's population is still slightly smaller than those of its peer schools, such as Colegio San Agustin in Dasmariñas Village, and La Salle Greenhills and Xavier School both in Greenhills," the parents pointed out. "In constructing buildings over the years, DLSZ obtained permits from AAVA. There are other schools located in Ayala Alabang, but the color-coding scheme will only apply to De La Salle Zobel. The issue is taking its toll on the community. Concerned residents have joined calls for AAVA to reconsider, and parents are getting anxious."
So we have Ayala Alabang residents on one side and DLSZ non-resident students on the other side. Both have valid points. But all DLSZ and its non-resident parents are asking for are a proper dialogue and more time to prepare. As it is, the notice seems too short, not to mention it arrived right smack in the middle of the current school year.
To end this, we asked two friends--one a parent of a non-resident DLSZ student, the other an Ayala Alabang resident--to give their thoughts on the issue. They both requested not to be named.
"So many families will be affected by this," said the non-resident parent. "They should have given us ample time to prepare. Why do this during the school year? At least give us the chance to decide whether we want to enroll our kids in the school with the color-coding scheme already in place. We have a choice. We can look for another school that doesn't present us with this problem."

"Right now, there are just too many non-resident cars entering the village," said the resident. "Better to carpool or organize more shuttle services for students. As the association puts it, the education of the youth is very important, but more important is an environment of peace, safety and order."
This is a complicated issue, and we hope it gets resolved soon. We don't wish to take sides, but we encourage everyone to chime in and join the discussion.
From the front row of Campbell Elementary School's multi-purpose room back in May, surrounded by their classmates, my son Anton scanned the audience, found me, and then stuck their tongue out, pointing, miming laughter. Despite pre-adolescent stabs at being cool, their insistent eagerness may be the most striking feature of their congenital “disability,” mosaic Down syndrome, wherein some of their cells are typical, others have Trisome 21. In fact, it's this feature that threatens my son's ability to succeed if Betsy DeVos' nomination is confirmed for Secretary of Education. I waved back (congenitally geeky), a silly, happy wave, as our principal stepped up to the lectern, patting the air to hush us buzzing parents, and announced it time for each rising sixth grader to stand, in turn, to deliver a five-minute speech at their "moving up" ceremony. Taking a deep breath, I inhaled — Axe deodorant, Pink perfume; scents I recognized as harbingers of middle school, the ending of an era.
How vivid this all is now. Eight months ago, I was a parent just like any other, excited, thrilled, and nervous as my son embarked on a new phase in their academic life. Eight months later, and I'm sitting on what could be the end of another era. Those nerves from that May night have now been replaced with fear, terror, and a never-ending list of scary what ifs. President Trump's education secretary pick Betsy DeVos is up for a final confirmation vote, most likely on Monday, Feb. 6. Video from DeVos' confirmation hearing shows them dimpled confusion about (and overall disbelief in) the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which provides free, appropriate education to students with disabilities across the nation. Them nomination jeopardizes everything Anton and their supports have worked tirelessly for.

Without the IDEA, would my son have been included, expected to perform, the night of their fifth grade promotion? Would they be included in anything at all?
The IDEA gives parents a say in their child's education every step of the way. It ensures that our children learn in the least-restrictive environment — the general education classroom — wherever possible. DeVos' suggestion that the IDEA is “negotiable,” and “up to the states to enforce or not” is my parental nightmare. On the simplest level, it threatens Anton's ability to do their best in school with support and accommodations. Without the IDEA, would my son have been included, expected to perform, the night of their fifth grade promotion? Would they be included in anything at all?
Eight months ago, as audience settled and the speeches began, I exchanged smiles with other parents, some I'd known for the past five years and several from the disability community. Among the first of the students to speak was our neighbor, Brady, all side-swept bangs and solemn eyes. They recalled their terror on the first day of Kindergarten:
I got to the classroom, saw all the kids I didn't know, saw the strange teacher, and I asked my mom to homeschool me.
Then they shrugged, settling into their suit jacket. They concluded with a cocky grin: “Who would have thought in Kindergarten, I would be here, like this, today?”

Chuckling along with everyone else, I felt warmed to be part of the group. You've also come a long way, Mama, I secretly congratulated myself, remembering how I'd sobbed through Anton's graduation from cooperative preschool. My funny, sensitive boy has always been bright, but young for their age, and behind, in some ways, academically. (In third grade, when classmates were reading Harry Potter, their favorite book was Caps for Sale.) How I worried “back in the day” that he'd get crushed in what I imagined being the cut-throat arena of Kindergarten. Visions of homeschooling danced through my head at pickup time that first day when their general education teacher pulled me aside to whisper, “Ixnay on the pullups.” My sweet boy. My baby. Oh my God!
We've compromised more than once, but our goal has always been the same: keep Anton with grade-level curriculum as much as possible. There's never been a question or even a suggestion from anyone in our schools that Anton shouldn't be given the intellectual and social challenges of every other kid. DeVos' confirmation could drastically and dangerously change all of that.

But by the second week of elementary school, teachers had “more or less” potty trained Anton (and had their good-natured ways of dealing with the “less”). Some private nursery schools will expel a student for a single accident, but public schools — so Anton's teachers reminded me — are federally mandated to offer free, accommodated education to all — and all means all. If someone, Anton's teachers or me, underestimates him, wants to keep them separated or babied, even for the best of reasons, someone else will check the impulse: Is this the least-restrictive environment? Are they accessing grade-level curriculum? Do they have the accommodations and supports they need to succeed?
Per the IDEA, we have yearly individualized education plan (IEP) meetings with Anton's teachers, their principal, and their occupational and speech therapists to determine what success means for Anton and how they can succeed. At Campbell Elementary, these meetings were often informative and lively as we pooled understandings to come up with reasonable, measurable goals for my “unconventional learner” in light of their current progress and needs. Despite passing disagreements among team members, we all saw the same kid, an open, empathetic boy who shared jokes with friends and teachers (“You're amazing,” he'd reportedly sing in greeting their teacher every morning, waiting for them to finish the line: “Just the way you are”), but who withdrew when tired or frustrated, removing their glasses and rubbing their eyes. At times, my husband and I pushed for their full inclusion in every general education class, wanting to respect and foster our son's social skills. We've compromised more than once, but our goal has always been the same: keep Anton with grade-level curriculum as much as possible. There's never been a question or even a suggestion from anyone in our schools that Anton shouldn't be given the intellectual and social challenges of every other kid. DeVos' confirmation could drastically and dangerously change all of that.

And so, after five years and a dozen IEP meetings, Anton was ready to move on from elementary school. Here they are now, I thought, as the promotion speeches continued, happy to see them in their place surrounded by their peers — they aren't a math dice winner like some of the other kids, but they were a school patroller, Boy Scout, baseball player, reader, thinker, joker. A rising middle-schooler with a small pack of buddies if I ever saw one.
I saw myself running up to rescue Anton. But then I saw him. If their lip trembled, it meant they aren't crying. They aren't speaking, but they also aren't sitting down. Increased independence had been a running theme in the goals of all their IEP drafts, their number-one need as they approached sixth grade. So with the others in the audience, I stayed in my seat. From a horrible distance, I just watched my son's distress.
As the speeches kept coming, each time one of their friends stood up, my son would point with two v-shaped fingers to their own eyes, then to mine, and then to the speech-giver. Pay attention, mom. My confidence in Anton's happiness that night felt solid even though it had been a rough week. Two days prior, I'd learned that my presumed “neurotypical” daughter had failed eighth-grade algebra. More upsetting, after a swift decline, my larger-than-life father-in-law's death (Anton's "Baba") seemed imminent and my husband had to skip Anton's promotion ceremony to say their last goodbye. So when it was Anton's turn to speak, I didn't tear up or feel my heart pound. They look nice, I thought, glad their dress pants still fit. I readied to videotape him, typically my husband's job.
But minutes passed, and there was nothing to record. Anton stood stock still, eyes cast down behind their thick-framed glasses — “geeky chics” that matched their dad's — their lips moving soundlessly. The audience, too, went silent.

Later they would tell me how their body started shaking. I saw several kids cast them sympathetic looks, while others squirmed impatiently as their teacher whispered in their ear. Eventually, they put their hands on Anton's shoulders, urging them to sit. I was beside myself. My son had Down syndrome and this was a challenging event for any kid. Why hadn't I insisted they practice? Or written them notecards in all-caps? I knew they had tracking and concentration problems. I should have written/read the stupid speech.
I suspect most parents of a “different” kid have wobbled on the brink of this abyss. (But I also suspect most parents have kids who at some point seem “different,” so who doesn't wobble?) Trump's attorney general pick, Jeff Sessions, has argued before the Senate that accommodations for students with disabilities contribute to the declining “civility” and “discipline” in American classrooms. When we internalize these stigmatizing attitudes, we forget that the needs for humor, breaks, movement, patience, empathy, even disorder are those all kids sometimes share. That night, I saw myself running up to rescue Anton. But then I saw him. If their lip trembled, it meant they aren't crying. They aren't speaking, but they also aren't sitting down. Increased independence had been a running theme in the goals of all their IEP drafts, their number-one need as they approached sixth grade. So with the others in the audience, I stayed in my seat. From a horrible distance, I just watched my son's distress.
With the appropriate support, none of us need be defined by our (special or not) needs or the needs of our family members.

I was lucky. The abyss closed up without my falling in: “You rock, Anton!” one shaky voice called out, instantly joined by five voices, then 10. Soon the entire audience chanted, “An-ton! An-ton! An-ton!” I cried, overwhelmed by what seemed like a miracle. When the crowd finally quieted, Anton read a speech no better or worse than the other kids'. They thanked a million teachers and said their favorite subject was recess. When they finished, the undisciplined crowd stood — roaring, clapping, crying — with a standing ovation. My own standing ovation was as much for the community around us as it was for my son.
Anton, now a mid-year sixth grader with two “OK” oral book talks under their belt, talks about elementary school less and less. Even in the weeks when the memory of promotion night was fresh, they didn't mention the speech. Instead, they told everyone and their mother how he'd bravely asked their crush to take a selfie with him; they sometimes referenced our “late, late” dinner at Red Robin with their friends. They talked often about how that night — right after they were promoted — their Baba became an “angel” in heaven. Occasionally, they still sleep with a photo of Baba next to their bed. But the drama of their stage fright, then their speaking? — it just passed. With the appropriate support, none of us need be defined by our (special or not) needs or the needs of our family members.

Anton took their standing ovation, their promotion, even their free, public education for granted. When Anton was drowning, their community's love carried them to shore. Those supports are in place for a reason. They ensure no child fails or is left behind. Once on solid ground, they never looked back. Entitled? Absolutely. But doesn't every kid have the right to be?
SHANGHAI—The arrest and disappearance of three labour activists investigating a Chinese company that produces Ivanka Trump shoes in China prompted a call for their brand to stop working with the supplier and raised questions about whether the first family's commercial interests would muddy U.S. leadership on human rights. “Ivanka's brand should immediately cease its work with this supplier, and the Trump administration should reverse its current course and confront China on its human rights abuses,” Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in a Wednesday email. Ivanka Trump must decide, they added, “whether they can ignore the Chinese government's apparent attempt to silence an investigation into those worker abuses.”

Amnesty International called Wednesday for the release of China Labor Watch investigator Hua Haifeng, as well as their two colleagues, who are feared to have been detained. Read more: 1 activist arrested, 2 missing after investigating Chinese factory that makes Ivanka Trump shoes The men were working with an American non-profit group to publish a report next month alleging low pay, excessive overtime and possible misuse of student labour, according to China Labor Watch executive director Li Qiang, who lost contact with the investigators over the weekend. The investigators also witnessed verbal abuse, with one manager insulting staff about poorly made shoes and making a crude reference in Chinese to female genitalia, according to Li.

China Labor Watch has been exposing poor working conditions at suppliers to some of the world's best-known companies for nearly two decades, but Li said their work has never before attracted this level of scrutiny from China's state security apparatus. The arrest and disappearances come amid a crackdown on perceived threats to the stability of China's ruling Communist Party, particularly from sources with foreign ties such as China Labor Watch. Faced with rising labour unrest and a slowing economy, Beijing has taken a stern approach to activism in southern China's manufacturing belt and to human rights advocates generally, sparking a wave of critical reports about disappearances, public confessions, forced repatriation and torture in custody. China Labor Watch's investigation also had an unusual target: a brand owned by the daughter of the president of the United States. Ivanka Trump's lifestyle brand imports most of its merchandise from China, trade data show. They and their father both have extensive trademark portfolios in China, though neither has managed to build up a large retail or real estate presence here. The sister of Jared Kushner, a Trump adviser and husband of Ivanka, travelled to China this past month to court investment from Chinese families for a real estate project in New Jersey. “The eagerness of members of the family to do business in China while airbrushing very troubling human rights and labour rights records of the country is troubling,” said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia director for Amnesty International. They said it is only a matter of time before it is known “to what extent business is trumping any kind of consideration of the diplomatic capital of the U.S. in promoting human rights, labour rights and democracy.”
White House spokesperson Hope Hicks referred questions to Ivanka Trump's brand. The Ivanka Trump brand declined to comment. Abigail Klem, who took over day-to-day management when the first daughter became a White House presidential adviser, has said the brand requires licensees and their manufacturers to “comply with all applicable laws and to maintain acceptable working conditions.”

China tightened control over foreign NGOs starting this year by requiring them to register with state security. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a regular news briefing Wednesday that they were not aware of the arrest and disappearances. They said China welcomed international NGOs to carry out research, but added, “we also hope that NGOs can also observe Chinese laws and regulations and don't engage in any illegal actions or behaviour.” Hua Haifeng was accused of illegal surveillance, according to their wife, Deng Guilian, who said the police called them Tuesday afternoon. Deng said the caller told them they didn't need to know the details, only that they would not be able to see, speak with or receive money from their husband, the family's breadwinner. The crime carries a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment. Li said China Labor Watch asked police about the Deng and the two other investigators, Li Zhao and Su Heng, on Monday but received no reply. The Associated Press was unable to reach the other investigators' families. China's Ministry of Public Security and police could not be reached for comment Tuesday, which was a national holiday in China. Calls went unanswered Wednesday morning. The men were investigating Huajian Group factories in the southern Chinese cities of Ganzhou and Dongguan. Su Heng had been working undercover at the Ganzhou factory since April, Li said. In January, Liu Shiyuan, then spokesperson for the Huajian Group, told AP the company makes 10,000 to 20,000 pairs of shoes a year for Ivanka Trump's brand — a fraction of the 20 million pairs the company produces a year. A current spokesperson for the company, Long Shan, did not reply to questions Tuesday or Wednesday morning. Li said investigators had seen Ivanka Trump-brand merchandise, as well as production orders for Ivanka Trump, Marc Fisher, Nine West and Easy Spirit. “We were unaware of the allegations and will look into them immediately,” a spokesperson for Marc Fisher, which manufactures Ivanka Trump, Easy Spirit and its own branded shoes, said in an email Tuesday. Nine West did not respond to requests for comment.

Let us now discuss these setups; I'm writing with the agency in mind, so I'll often refer to the agency as “you”. To frame the discussion, let us have presented the definition of Product Owner :
As I worked as a Product Owner on the agency side of this type of relationship, I've started becoming skeptic about the potential of such setup. Over time, thanks to
Implementing Scrum in a standalone organisation (such as a product company) derives directly from the framework. Yet some aspects are open to interpretation for Scrum teams in an agency providing software development services to clients. Both The Scrum Guide and most literature on best practices of implementing Scrum lack the notion that the so-called “organisation” may be, in fact, two separate legal and business entities: the agency and the client. How do you apply The Agile Manifesto's “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation” when the underlying “organisation” exists precisely because of a contract?
Product Owner on the agency side
In this scenario, the agency provides the whole Scrum team as a service: Development Team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner. With no other roles defined, we are left to interpret people on the client side (even at the C-level) as Stakeholders. These provide valuable input, and feedback, that the Product Owner shall take into account towards decisions regarding the Product Backlog, priorities, etc.
But sooner or later, from within those Stakeholders, a HiPPO appears (for those unfamiliar with the term: Highest Paid Person's Opinion). Good luck telling that HiPP that their O needs to be considered at equal footing with the input from any other stakeholder, using more objective criteria than “CEO says”, and that the decision whether their feature request makes it into the product lies with some other company's employee.
This quickly institutes as normal a Product Owner smell: “The Product Owner is underpowered and does not act as the guard of the backlog” — also known as underpowered proxy Product Owner . This is specially true when the client organisation does not fully embrace either the use of Scrum in particular or the Agile principles in general.
This may also be a sign of a Scrum cargo cult: the client never wanted to buy product ownership as a service, but “that's how we [agency] do it”. Client and agency are not aligned on what the former is buying from the latter. If the service provided to the client includes full product ownership, this needs to be crystal clear, both in the contract and in our value proposal. You need to provide real product ownership (which should “look” more like product management and less like project management). To do this, you need someone who lives and breathes the client's business, both on knowledge and dedication (100% to one Scrum team).
I see this as very hard to cope with on a case per case basis in a generalist agency. It is better suited for a company which focuses in developing products for one vertical (or a narrow set thereof).
Product Owner on the client side
If you don't have what it takes to provide product ownership as your value proposal, or the client doesn't want to buy that service, then it is up to the client to own their product. They have the business know-how, the money, the corporate authority, and they assign someone within their own company to call the shots on this product. If the client needs help with requirements analysis, then provide this within the cross-functional Development Team (“The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it.”). Don't force-sell a Product Owner just because the client needs an analyst.
In this setup, I cannot stress enough the importance of a strong, full-time, dedicated Scrum Master. Reducing the Scrum Master to someone from elsewhere in the company who acts as a part-time therapist who makes sure meetings begin and end on time is wrong in any case—but in this one, is a recipe for disaster. The Scrum Master will be the key mediator in the relationship between the Development team in one company and the Product Owner in another company. Thus, as the keeper of the process, he/she might have to push back on some of the client's wishes. He/she must be able to do so with propriety, and that's only possible with a fully capable and dedicated (hence committed) Scrum Master.
What if there's no Product Owner?
This happens when the client does not buy in to hiring product ownership, but does not fulfil that role on their side either. They might assign a manager of some sort as the point of contact, but lacking the right skills, mindset (the client and/or this person does not trust Agile, or do not yet trust you enough to go for it), remit, and/or bandwidth (the company has a lot more on the plate for this person). This person is not a Product Owner.

This all too common situation would ideally be detected early on, and for an agency that is serious about providing high-quality and high-value software development services this should be a watershed moment. At this point, two things are, for me, evident.
If there's no Product Owner, there's no Scrum. Insisting on Scrum because “we do Scrum” in this scenario is pure cargo cult. (This reasoning also applies, for instance, if the client is not willing to commit to hiring a stable and properly sized development team.)
If there's no Product Owner, you might as well not have a product at all. If the client is not willing to have a full-time person (either their own or from the agency) devoted to the continuous quest for value, they're probably not serious about this initiative as a long-term one — or they have not matured it enough
Depending on how you, the agency, position yourself commercially, there are a couple of valid options for the agency at this watershed moment.
Offer your services in the form of a project
This means branding and managing the relationship between client and agency as a project, from beginning to end (two things that a project, by definition, should have). Spec the project, assign a project manager, call him/her just that, and deliver—skipping Scrum and Agile altogether. The result will not be the best, IMHO, but both parties will learn a lot. This project may give origin to another project that builds upon the first one, and after a handful of (small!) projects both you and the client will have learned more:
about each other; and
about the common thread of these projects.
Now you're in a better position to establish a less intermittent relationship that sits on top of a product vision, where makes much more sense to apply an Agile framework such as Scrum.
Politely say ‘No'
You can (and should) have ground rules. You can have a ground rule of using Scrum (or, putting it in another way, only taking upon initiatives where it makes sense to apply Scrum).
You can (and I think you should) have ground rules regarding the type of work you sign up for — e.g., you just don't do PHP.
You can (and I think you should) have ground rules regarding how you conduct your work and your meta-work (for instance, Thoughtbot don't do “fixed-bid, fixed-feature-set proposals” nor “provide itemized invoices to clients showing individual pieces of work that were done”).
If the opportunity before you goes against your ground rules, then you should walk away, instead of providing a lesser service only to close another deal. However, you have to be confident that those ground rules really relate to how you perform best. When you set your terms this boldly, you must make sure that you will excel, to the benefit of your client and of your reputation.
Big Finish is pleased to announce additional cast members for the upcoming UNIT: Extinction..
UNIT: Extinction is a brand-new box set of adventures that take place in the world of the New Series of Doctor Who, with Jemma Redgrave reprising the role of Kate Stewart and Ingrid Oliver back as trusty scientist Osgood. The story sees the Unified Intelligence Taskforce defending the Earth from the might of the Nestene Consciousness and its army of plastic Autons.
Representing the aliens is Simon Devlin, the pioneer behind technology giant Futuretech, which holds the key to the Nestene's latest incursion. Devlin is played by Steve John Shepherd (This Life, EastEnders).
‘Steve was suggested to us by their agent just at the same moment as I was sending off an email to ask for him!' says producer David Richardson. ‘He has such a magnificent, rich voice, and they make Devlin a true power to be reckoned with.'
Devlin's schemes are handled by their ruthless security chief Jenna Gold, played by Karina Fernandez (Happy-Go-Lucky, Pride, Mr Turner).
‘Karina was originally recommended to us by their friend Anthony Howell when we were casting The Avengers,' says David. ‘We've since asked for them many times since - she's an astonishing talent.'
Waving a tentacle across the whole affair will be the Nestene Consciousness itself, once again played Big Finish Executive Producer Nicholas Briggs. The Consciousness has recreated itself after its last invasion attempt in 2005's Rose, and its new form will prove more than a match for UNIT.
Outside of the circle of villains, Tracy Wiles (Doctor Who: Masters of Earth) plays intrepid journalist Jacquie McGee, whose relentless pursuit of truth brings them straight to the front lines of the conflict; with their put-upon assistant Tim Stevens (Derek Carlyle) dragged along for the ride!
‘Since their first appearance for us in Masters of Earth, Tracy has become a real friend of Big Finish,' says David. ‘We'd have them in everything if we could - but they were so perfect for the role of the determined Jacqui.'
With the remaining cast including Warren Brown, Ramon Tikaram and James Joyce, the stage is set for the blockbuster release of UNIT: Extinction. You can pre-order this November release today, as well as three follow-up series – with special savings available as part of our UNIT Bundle.
The White House moved Wednesday to counter critics who claim President Trump's travel ban goes too far, circulating a list of terror cases involving suspects who came to the U.S. from the seven countries in question.
The list, obtained by Fox News, gave 24 examples of refugees and other immigrants from Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria and Libya who have been arrested on terror-related charges; most have been convicted.
Those seven, mostly Muslim countries were singled out in Trump's executive order, which suspended immigration for 90 days from those nations.
The document of terror arrests appears to be, in part, a rebuke to Seattle U.S. District Judge James Robart who, in questioning a Justice Department lawyer last week about the number of post-9/11 arrests of foreign nationals from those countries, incorrectly asserted: “Let me tell you … The answer to that is none, as best I can tell.”
Robart halted the rollout of the executive order. The case is now before the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where Justice Department lawyers are arguing for the restoration of the measure.
The White House document itself names 10 individuals from Somalia, six from Iraq, one from Yemen, two from Sudan, two from Iran, two from Libya and one from Syria. The cases span the last eight years, and include most recently a case in June in which two Somali refugees were jailed for conspiring to commit murder in Syria on behalf of ISIS.
It also includes a case from March of last year, where a Yemeni native who became a U.S. citizen was sentenced to 22 years in prison for attempting to provide “material support” to ISIS and planning to shoot and kill members of the U.S. military who had returned from Iraq.
The dossier also cited a case from January 2016, in which a Palestinian who was born in Iraq and came to the U.S. as a refugee allegedly tried to provide material support to terror groups abroad. The dossier cites media reports that they told their wife, “I want to blow myself up … I am against America.”
Earlier in the day, Trump defended their order at a meeting with local police chiefs and sheriffs in Washington, D.C., and hinted that they thought the court case was being politicized.
"I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I won't call it biased and we haven't had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political," they said. “It would be so great for our justice system if they were able to read a statement and do what's right and that's to do with the security of our nation, which is so important.”
They warned that until the issue was resolved, the nation's security would be at risk.
"I think it's sad, I think it's a sad day," they said. "I think our security is at risk today and it will be at risk until such time as ... we get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country."
While the rollout of Trump's order, signed just days into their presidency, was marred by confusion over its application to green-card holders and others, critics have argued more broadly that it amounts to a discriminatory "Muslim" ban.
Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued in a court hearing that Trump campaign statements reveal "shocking evidence" of intent to discriminate.

EXCLUSIVE / Israel has seized three EU-funded humanitarian aid projects on the edge of a settlement construction zone that Europe views as a ‘red line', spurring demands for compensation payments to Brussels at a crisis moment for John Kerry's Mideast peace bid.
The three humanitarian aid shelters were dismantled on 8 April in Ras-a-Baba, also known as Jabal-al-Baba, which lies in the E1 corridor of the West Bank, linking the settlement of Ma'ale Adumim to Jerusalem.
All three shelters were prefabricated caravans, built for families made homeless in severe storms that hit the region in December. They were funded by the EU's humanitarian aid wing, DG ECHO, and some were provided by the French development agency, Action Contre la Faim (ACF).
Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, told EURACTIV that the seizure was “more than a provocation, it is a crime,” and linked it to the deteriorating Mideast peace process.
“We ask the EU to apply their laws in relation to Israel,” they said. “This is consistent with the Israeli policy of forced displacement of the Palestinian population around occupied East Jerusalem.”
EU officials contacted by EURACTIV confirmed that they also saw the Israeli action as a “forced displacement of Palestinians” that breached international law and “must be halted immediately”.
“While we acknowledge that these events come at a politically sensitive time where parties to the conflict are currently negotiating a peace-deal brokered by the US (Secretary of State) John Kerry, we must nevertheless denounce the humanitarian consequences of such actions and try to prevent further demolitions from occurring by unreservedly condemning them,” a senior source said. Internal discussions are underway over proposals to demand compensation for such actions in future.
The dismantling of Palestinian homes in the E1 region has previously been followed by settlement construction.
“The location is definitely an attractive area and when you go there it is easy to understand why it is coveted by the Israelis,” a European diplomat in the region told EURACTIV over the phone. “It is quite beautiful and there's a nice view of Jerusalem. It is also between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem and is prime real estate.”
In November 2012, the Netanyahu government announced a zoning plan to build 3,000 Jewish housing units in E1 that would create an urban bloc linking Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim, and disrupting the territorial coherence of any future state.
An EU Foreign Affairs Council the next month expressed “deep dismay and strong opposition” to the plan which would “seriously undermine the prospects of a negotiated resolution of the conflict” and “could also entail forced transfer of civilian population.”
The Conclusions pledged to “closely monitor the situation and its broader implications, and act accordingly.” EURACTIV understands that a delegation of European diplomats in Jerusalem will deliver a complaint to the Israeli authorities about the seizure today (11 April). More actions could follow.
“One of the key messages coming up will be a call for freeze on demolitions and for a fair planning and zoning regime to be put in place,” the diplomat said. “I don't know if it will happen today but it is in the pipeline.”
Some 79 EU-funded structures were demolished in the West Bank's ‘Area C' and Jerusalem region in 2012 and 54 more were destroyed in the first six months of 2013, according to an EU incident logging service. In all, the European Commission says that between 2001 and 2011, Israel destroyed development projects worth €49.14 million, of which €29.37 million was funded by the EU or its member states.
As Israel is increasingly blamed for an impasse in Mideast peace talks, calls are growing for compensation for such actions at an EU Mashreq and Maghreb (MaMa) working group meeting that is expected to deliver recommendations on an EU ‘Area C' report on Tuesday 15 April.
Compensation calls
One EU diplomat in Brussels speaking on condition of anonymity told EURACTIV that while the final note was still being finalised, many member states now favoured such a proposal. “We should ask for compensation from Israel whenever EU-funded humanitarian aid projects are destroyed,” they said. “That would definitely be a pertinent recommendation.”
EURACTIV understands that no opposition was raised to this recommendation when it was raised in MaMa group discussions. The recent E1 demolition could have an effect on the vote, the diplomat said, as it was “a very good example that we need to do something concrete.”
The EU's humanitarian aid commissioner, Kristalina Georgieva, recently wrote a letter to the Israeli defence minister Moshe Ya'alon, outlining their concerns about the destruction of EU-funded structures in the West bank. But it remains to be seen whether a proposal to demand recompense will be included in the final note, which will then face a long route to the European Council.
Maja Kocijancic, a spokesperson for the EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, would only say that a delegation of diplomats visited the caravan site, also known as Jaba-al-Baba in February, when ‘stop work' orders were first delivered and would do so again today.
“We will raise this issue with the relevant Israeli authorities,” Kocijancic said.
Israeli reaction
An Israeli spokesperson contacted by EURACTIV declined an interview about the new E1 action but sent a statement saying that the three caravans were seized because they had been “assembled illegally”.
“At least two of the buildings [were] located on state land and within the jurisdiction of the city of Ma'ale Adumim,” the statement read.
It went on: “It is important to note that the elements in question were carefully dismantled and seized by the authorized bodies of the Civil Administration and that their owners can act according to the standard procedure in order to get them back from the Supervision Unit.”
EU officials counter that the lack of any meaningful permitting regime for Palestinians can make complaints of permit violations a self-reinforcing proposition, and some fear that they can make EU aid funding complicit in violations of international humanitarian law.
“I think every diplomat working here realises that we are here to help the Palestinians and build Palestinian institutions but in the end we end up funding the occupation as we are taking care of the responsibilities that Israel should take care, of as an occupying power,” an EU diplomat in Jerusalem told EURACTIV. “So when we support the occupied population instead of Israel, we let them off the hook.”
Death knell
The Ras-a-baba demolition occurred hours after an instruction by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to their ministers to stop all high-level meetings with their Palestinian counterparts, in retaliation for a Palestinian bid to join 15 UN treaties and conventions as a state party.
This has been seen as the end of US Secretary of State John Kerry's attempts to revive the battered 1993 Oslo peace Accord in the form of a framework agreement on principles.
While the Oslo talks have ground on, by 2011, Israeli settlements which are considered illegal under international law, had expanded to house over 520,000 settlers, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
The following year saw a 300% increase in the number of settler units issued for tender, OCHA says. In total 43% of the West Bank has now been allocated to settlement local and regional councils.

Winter climbing in Colorado is like a box of chocolates…you never know what you're gonna get. This year has been no exception, with an almost comical oscillation between too hot and too cold, too windy and too wet. In the Air Force we like to say:
“Flexibility is the key to airpower.” – Italian General Giulio Douhet
This attitude is essential if you want to get your send-on this time of year. I'll probably have it scrawled on my tombstone. On the other hand, the Rock Prodigy Method advocates setting a firm goal and sticking with it. So how do we resolve this cognitive dissonance? Well in the case of my winter season, it was by being flexible about what constitutes “reasonable climbing conditions.” Allow me to explain….
I had been interested in the hard climbs lining the right side of Clear Creek Canyon's Wall of the Nineties since Mark first sent Mission Overdrive in the spring of 2013 . I knew these routes would have small, sharp holds, so I would need consistent cold weather to be successful, in order to be able to pull on the tiny holds without destroying my fingertips. Redpointing, after all, is a war of attrition with fitness, psyche, and skin all in diminishing supply. So as far back as early 2013 I had made an appointment for winter '15 to come to grips with the Wall of the ‘90s (yes, I am THAT calculating…sometimes). The nice thing about this “date” was that it was far enough in the future that it relieved any performance anxiety :).
Well, now my time was up. I started my training in mid-November, scheduling it so that I would hit my early bouldering peak at the start of January, and I could ride it through February – what I suspected would be ideal sending temps for the low-lying Wall of the 90's. In my hangboard training, I paid special attention to small closed crimps and slopey crimps, even re-arranging my hangboard grip selection to feature those grips. I also emphasized a two-finger crimp that I have been working on for about 18 months (since the RPTC was launched). It's taken that long to feel confident on that grip, and now I could really push myself with it. Hangboarding went really well, and I carried the momentum to my Max Recruitment phase.
After Christmas, I had to jump back into work, but my heart was longing to go test my fitness on my goal routes. I started by working on Interstellar Overdrive (5.13d), a Clear Creek classic. I hoped that a quick ascent of it would give me some early confidence that I could take with me over to Mission Overdrive (14b), a harder variation that links the first crux (~V11) of Mission Impossible into the crux of Interstellar Overdrive (~V8). Mission Overdrive was my stated goal for the season, with an eventual attempt on Mission Impossible some years down the road, when I was “more ready”.
In the book and on this site we have discussed the benefit of starting your season with easier routes to build toward your goal – sort of “mini route-pyramid”. When it works, it works well because it builds your confidence and gives you psyche and momentum for your goal route. Unfortunately, sometimes you shoot too high by picking “tune-up” routes that are too hard, squandering time and eroding your confidence. I had overshot.
There is something about the upper crux of Interstellar Overdrive that doesn't fit me…maybe the holds are made of kryptonite, or Mike-tonite. They say it's V8, but to me it feels much harder. I made progress, but it was slower than I liked. Eventually I was just waiting for better weather, so I began working the “Mission Crux”, the opening boulder that would link into Interstellar Overdrive to create “Mission Overdrive”, my eventual goal. To my shock and delight, it came together very quickly for me. Where the “Overdrive” crux was my nemesis, this seemed to fit me very well. I made long links on it on my first day trying it, and on my 3rd day I redpointed the entire crux. I was using Interstellar Overdrive as a warmup, and I eventually sent it on January 30th. Things were starting to hum now….
The next day out I completed Mission Overdrive! It was one of my hardest routes yet, but I wasn't satisfied. Instead it just made me more psyched to try Mission Impossible! Over the last few weeks I had spent many burns dangling from the Overdrive crux, gazing to the left at the “Impossible” crux and wondering…. “I had mastered the “Mission” crux fairly quickly, so could this “Impossible” crux really be possible? For me? I'm not a 5.14c climber, would trying the route be anything but hubris? After struggling at first on Overdrive, did I have any business trying Mission Impossible?”
One of my flaws is this rigid, linear thinking: The idea that if A > B and I struggled on B, then I have no business trying A. (This is one of our go-to discussion topics when Mark and I hang out). This time I reasoned that my struggles with “B” (Interstellar Overdrive) were not indicative of my climbing ability, just my fit with the route. This time I was going to try “A”!
The same day I finished Mission Overdrive I got on Mission Impossible to try the upper crux. There was a pretty good rest between the cruxes, so if I could master it quickly with a little bit of margin, just maybe a Sand was possible. Not years in the future, but now!
The upper crux was hard, Steve-Bechtel-hard, but I did every move and just needed to figure out how to link them. The hardest moves were pulls off of two miniscule crimps that would make poor footholds. They were sharp, painful, and fickle, but I could pull on them…the worst holds I had ever tried to use. Remember that 2-finger crimp I added to my hangboard routine? It paid off. Of course, these were the moves at the END of the boulder problem. I still had to climb into them through a very difficult and taxing sequence, but there was hope.
I retreated for the day, stoked on the possibility that this “dream route” could maybe, just maybe go down. I religiously nursed my fingertips, obsessively monitored the forecast, and doggedly begged for belayers so I could work the “proj”. Gradually I made progress on the upper boulder. The crux crimp moves never felt easier, but the powerful sequence leading into them got much more fluid, and after a couple days, I could do it without being taxed. The weather was a problem though. We were having record-breaking heat on the Front Range, and I couldn't do those crimp moves. If I tried, the crimps would eviscerate my fingers. Then, when it would get cold it would swing from 65 and sunny to 23 and snowing. It was frustrating. So while I refined the rest of the route, I had few chances to try the most decisive moves. Finally, a “goldilocks” system came through, or something like it, and I became hopeful and anxious.
I went out on a weeknight with Janelle (thanks to our very kind baby-sitters!) and came tantalizingly close. I got my first one-hang, reaching the crux razor crimps, and falling while trying to move off of them. I was also able to rehearse that move a few times, workout out some better foot beta and gain some confidence. Unfortunately, I wore a pretty deep gash in my left index finger. The weather showed another warm front, so the few days of forced rest were tolerable. I took three complete rest days – I never do that! Sunday would be the next day out, and a big winter storm was coming in Monday. Then the storm shifted to Sunday afternoon – crap! We would go out Sunday morning.
This pushed my “sending temps” envelope. The forecasted high was 38 in Golden, and the car read 37 when we pulled into the lot at 0900. The temps were supposed to continue falling throughout the day, along with snow, starting around noon. I had warmed up a bit on my treadwall before leaving home, but I had learned earlier that jumping straight on the route after warming up in a warm garage was ineffective. So, I did a quick warmup run on the first Mission boulder to acclimate to the rock temps and rehearse moves. It was nearly a disaster! I felt completely discombobulated; I was slipping off the slopey holds, and getting flash pumped. I reminded myself that it was just a warmup, and I took a long rest after.
It worked. My next burns were dreamy. I went through the first boulder flawlessly, making moves statically that were usually desperate, insecure lunges. I was relaxed, and accumulated only a slight pump. Most importantly, I was recovering at the rest – a lot! That's the kind of fitness that seems to come only after working a particular route for a week or too. Your body seems to figure out what it needs to do to recover.
The snow started right on schedule, and when I tied in for my third burn, we were in the thick of the storm. It had been snowing for a couple hours, and was starting to accumulate. My pack was white, my thermometer read 32 degrees. Still, I figured it didn't hurt to try. I floated up to the rest and didn't feel much pump at all. My hands were freezing though; I was actually in danger of over-gripping the hand warmers in my chalkbag, and I wished I had more. I launched into the upper crux, snow swirling all around. I eased through the opening sequence and reached the razor crimps with a slight pump. I took my time setting my left hand crimp to make sure it was perfect, then groped for the right hand. At this point, I rejected all thoughts of pacing, grip control, and skin health and squeezed like hell on those crimps. I sucked up my right foot on the high-step easier than I ever had and stared down the next hold; a right hand stab to a horizontal crack. I took a breath, and went for it. Three of my fingertips stuck the hold and I was stunned. I hopped them up into a full four-finger crimp, and knew I was golden. I finished out the last easier moves, even forgetting to clip the last bolt. The wall was engulfed in a blizzard and there I was, the fool in a t-shirt, dangling by one arm from the top of a cliff. I couldn't have been happier!
Even as I write this a couple days later, it's hard for me to put into perspective. I started climbing in the early 90's when 5.14c was the end of the rating scale. It didn't exist in the US until 1992. The fact that I've worked my way to that grade is surreal. What's curious is that I'm not surprised to have done the route. As soon as I started working on it, I felt that I was up to the challenge. Whether deliberate or not, I had been training for this route for a decade, and now I believed I would do it, in time.
This paradox reveals a disconnect in my mind that is created by my years of training, years of improving, and the progress of the sport. When I began climbing, I struggled mightily to send my first 5.9, first 11a, first 12a, first 12c, first 13a and so on. Meanwhile, the sport was progressing too, and I never thought I would climb cutting-edge sport routes. Somewhere in there, my training and improvement overtook the pace of progress in the sport, but that improvement is so hard-fought, and often slow, that it is hard to notice. I don't necessarily FEEL stronger now than before, but I undoubtedly am. I'm hanging from much smaller holds now, and I have the hangboard data to prove it. Of course as climbers, we constantly throw ourselves at harder testpieces, so we are constantly struggling and failing – it's the nature of the sport. Also, if you're dedicated to long-term improvement, you spend a lot of time working on your weaknesses. I've done this a lot over the past six years or so, which was discouraging at times because I've been constantly encountering adversity. I only got a glimpse of my overall progress on those occasions that I allowed myself to gauge my progress on a route that exploits my strengths. Now I see clearly that it paid off!
So when you're in the trenches training day-to-day, it may feel like progress is slow-coming. The challenge is to keep up the motivation. If you had told the 13-year old Mike in 1990 that they could climb 14c if they trained smart and tried hard, they would sign up for that program every day of the week. Sometimes, it's only from that far away perspective that the tradeoffs make sense.
So Here's what I learned on this route:
Plan your training: Time it correctly to get the best weather conditions during your optimal fitness, and tailor your training to your goal route.
Conditions: you would be surprised what you can send in. Just make sure you're warmed up well.
Don't restrict yourself to only trying routes at “your level”. Every route is different, and you never know.
The training works over time. Stick to it and you'll see results, but maybe not on your preferred timeline.
Work on your weaknesses – doing so makes you a better climber, but occasionally you need to cash in your chips and see where you stand on a route that capitalizes on your strengths.
.
In the military we have a phrase: “Charlie-Mike” which is military shorthand for “continue the mission”. It's a way of encouraging one another to get the job done. So while I've accomplished this mission, the larger one – continuous improvement, as a climber, an athlete, a person will never be done. I hope you'll take this as inspiration and believe that you can do it to. Charlie Mike!

If you are a fan of the Nebraska Cornhuskers, you are no doubt aware and probably wrapped up in the current debate as to whether head football coach Bo Pelini should be fired for their team's abysmal second half showing against UCLA this past weekend combined their comments that they made two years ago before an interview. If you don't know what those comments are about, you can hear them for yourself.
Despite that, I believe that Bo Pelini deserves to be at Nebraska and not only finish out this season, but they deserve the support of the Nebraska fans that are now waiting on their doorstep with pitchforks and torches.
Like most Nebraska fans, I watched the UCLA game go to hell in a matter of 15 minutes. In that time, I sent quite a few texts to people that said that Bo was done at Nebraska. It was time to move on. We got downright embarrassed AGAIN on national TV. The game was a shit-show, just like the B1G Championship last year. I was done. Fire him, fire the staff and start fresh. We can't get worse than this. It's time to rebuild…again.
And that's how I felt when I heard the audio of Bo, after the Ohio State game in 2011, cussing out journalists and the Nebraska fans who left at halftime when the Huskers were down 20-6 at half. It should have been the final straw that solidified that Bo isn't fit for the program. But it wasn't.
I started reading both sides and for the first time in a long time, I really thought about the future of Nebraska football, and what Nebraska football really means to me. And that's when I saw the flaws in my – and I think a lot of people's – logic when it comes to being a Huskers fan.
Stupid Expectations
My expectations of Nebraska football – along with a majority of Husker fans – is to be a top-tier football team…every single year. And not just that, we get our hopes up for unbelievable things. People were talking about Nebraska winning the national championship this year. Nebraska…a team that graduated heavily on defense and was starting sophomores and first-year student. That's a lot of pressure to put on kids who are 5 months out of high school.
And this expectation has to be crushing on coaches and players. You win, and that's what's expected. You lose, and you should be fired. Now, I understand the argument, “We don't lose…we get CRUSHED.” This is true. It's actually Bo's coaching style to not stop the bleeding when things go wrong, and instead keep going full throttle with the game plan. This can sometimes work (OSU 2011, Northwestern 2012) but other times it just accentuates the problem and leads to blowouts.
We're in a different era
We are looking at college football in 2013. It's not 1996 anymore. With parity in place and more schools following Nebraska's lead in making football an economic engine for universities, we are running into much stiffer competition while getting fewer top-tier recruits. Also, the days of running an amazing option-based offense are over. That was our weapon for a long time, but it simply doesn't apply anymore. The game has changed.
Admit it, you don't care about the game, you care about winning
This is the truth that I had to come to. If I read that statement two days ago, I would have immediately ripped the author a new a-hole for writing it. “How dare you say that all I care about is winning!? I've been a devoted Husker fan for 32 years of my life! F#@& you!”
But when I was truly honest with myself, I realized that it wasn't about the players, or the school, or the fun of watching the game. Being a Nebraska fan is about winning. We fired Solich for not being able to win a championship. We're about to fire Bo for the same reason. We're still living in a fantasy world where it's 1996 and we expect to be ranked in the top 10 at the end of the season. If Bo were winning more games, I think their rant from two years ago would have been completely shrugged off. In fact, I doubt it would have even been brought to light. The opinion of Nebraska football hinges on whether the program is winning. But isn't there more to a tradition as great as Nebraska's than winning? We claim to be the best college football fans in the nation. To visiting teams, I would say this is true. However, we're very fair weather when it comes to our own boys in Scarlet and Cream.
The hard truth is that we judge the program based on wins and losses, and that's not good sportsmanship by any stretch. If we wanted to show that we were good sports we would stick by our team, through thick and thin. We would support the players by staying through the end of the game, even if we're getting the shit kicked out of us. We will stay involved in the game, cheering loudly at every defensive stand, and not make Memorial Stadium into a 4th quarter morgue.
It wouldn't matter if we went 12-0 for a season or 6-6. We'd stand behind our Huskers not because they won the game, but because they represent a great state and a great school. Because we graduate more Academic All-Americans than any other school. Because our players do amazing things for the community. Because Nebraska football is a vital part of being a Nebraskan. Does losing suck? Yes, yes it does. But do you know what sucks worse? Giving up on a team because of one or two bad games. That's bullshit. And I'm calling it out on myself as much as anyone else.
Bo obviously sucks at defense now, right?
When Bo started as head coach, they had some amazing talent to work with on defense. Say what you will about Callahan, the guy got some great recruits. When Bo had the talent, they were able to do some amazing things. We won two straight bowl games with him, reversing our fortunes from the end of the Callahan era. In fact, we shut out Arizona in the 2009 Holiday Bowl. That's not bad.
But Bo has an Achilles' heal known as the two gap defense. A defense that's based on having not only incredible athletes, but people who can think quickly, know where everyone is at on the field, and change where they are going to go in an instant based off of what the offense is doing. For college athletes, that's an incredibly hard thing to ask. But when it works, it's brilliant. When it doesn't work (as it's not now) it's awful. If Bo could get a defensive coordinator who could help them simplify that defense for the college level, they could field a top 10 defense again. However, you're not going to see that this year. This year will be tough, and teams have found Nebraska's soft spot. They will hammer us to death with it.
At the end of the day
We may lose a few more games this year, but it doesn't matter. I want to see the Huskers be successful, and right now Bo Pelini is our coach. And as such, I will support him, the players and the program by tuning in for each game, and instead of salivating for a win at any cost, I will look for growth in the team, listen for Hail Varsity, and remember that I am a member of a tradition that deserves more than what its fans (including me) have done for it.
GBR.
The province has agreed to test the soil around a uranium processing plant which has been operating in Toronto's west end for decades.
The existence of the GE Hitachi facility on Lansdowne Avenue came to light last October and since then, residents, politicians and public health officials have called for closer monitoring.
“The sampling and testing is being done in response to concerns expressed by the community and the request for soil testing made by Toronto's medical officer of health,” Kate Jordan, spokesperson for the Ministry of the Environment, said in an email.
They said the results of the tests — which will happen sometime this summer — will be made public and the ministry will take action if necessary. They didn't specify what that might entail.
“Local residents want to know that their homes and neighbourhood are safe from the serious health effects of uranium exposure,” Davenport MPP Jonah Schein and MP Andrew Cash wrote in a letter last February.
“They are concerned that emissions from the plant via air and water have accumulated in the vicinity over the 50 years that the plant has been in operation. One specific concern is that the food they grow in private and community gardens is unsafe to eat.”
GE Hitachi says it monitors air and water emissions at the site and conducts soil tests at 50 spots within a one-kilometre radius of the facility where it makes uranium fuel pellets.
“Test results show that we are nearly a zero-emission plant with respect to uranium emissions and in all cases we meet or exceed government requirements,” the company says on its website.
It says soil samples from residential areas last year showed between one and four parts of uranium per million, which it says falls within levels found in the earth's crust.
Uranium in other areas fall “well below” the federal criteria of 23 parts per million, the company claims.

The mother of missing serviceman Corrie Mckeague has said it is "just a matter of time" before they find their son's remains at a landfill site.
Nicola Urquhart's comments came after it emerged a refuse vehicle, seized shortly after the RAF gunner vanished from Bury St Edmunds, was carrying a heavier load than first thought.
It was initially deemed too light to have contained a body.
Mrs Urquhart said: "We know we are going to find Corrie in the landfill."
Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, Fife, was last seen on a night out on 24 September.
Live: Updates on search for missing Corrie Mckeague
The lorry, which picked up bins in the area they were last seen, took a route that appeared to coincide with signals from Mr Mckeague's mobile phone, Suffolk Police said.
Early investigations found the rubbish truck was carrying 11kg (1st 10lb), but detectives have since learned it was more than 100kg (15st 10lb) - "far higher than originally thought".
The finding emerged as police began a search of a landfill site in Milton, near Cambridge.
Mrs Urquhart said: "There's just no way realistically that Corrie was not in the bin.
"Regardless of how he's ended up in there, I cannot get my head around how he's ended up in landfill.
"I don't understand how the process has allowed them to get to landfill. It was the one thing that was giving me hope that they were still alive."

Mrs Urquhart previously reported the bin lorry went in to the "horseshoe" area of Bury St Edmunds at about 04:20 BST, just under an hour after Mr Mckeague was last seen.
Mr Mckeague's family had campaigned for the landfill to be examined early on in the investigation.
'Huge undertaking'
A search, which is expected to take up to 10 weeks, began on Monday after 8,000 tonnes of material was moved to make the site safe.
Det Supt Katie Elliott said the search was a "huge undertaking" that "still may not provide the answer as to what happened".
"But now, with new information uncovered by the officers working on the case, this is the priority," they said.
Image caption A bin was taken from the "horseshoe" area about an hour after the last sighting of Mr Mckeague
The dispute over the weight of the bin lorry - which led to the arrest of a 26-year-old man - was the result of a "genuine mistake", Det Supt Elliott said.
"The investigation has identified that the company who provided the data usually charge per collection, not per weight of load collected, and it appears that it was genuinely believed by the company that the data provided was correct.
The arrested man was held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice but has since been told no further action will be taken.

"There was no intention to mislead the investigation. However, our discovery... now puts a new emphasis on the search," Det Supt Elliott said.
Mr Mckeague, a gunner in No 2 Sqn, RAF Regiment, was based at Honington.
In January it was announced that Mr Mckeague's girlfriend, April Oliver, is pregnant with their child.
The Internal Revenue Service paid up to $13.6 billion in bogus claims for the Earned Income Tax Credit last year and as much as $132.6 billion over the past decade, according to an internal audit that already has some members of Congress questioning how the agency will be able to administer Obamacare.
IRS problems with the tax credit aren't new. In fact, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration said it warned officials about the problems in 2011 — but two years later, the agency still hasn't solved the situation and remains in violation of one of President Obama's executive orders.
Indeed, the IRS has not established annual targets for reducing the payments, which is required by law, nor is the agency complying with requirements that it report to auditors each quarter on any EITC payments totaling more than $5,000.
“The IRS should be commended for implementing numerous processes to educate Americans and identify and prevent improper EITC payments,” said J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration. “Unfortunately, it is still distributing more than $11 billion in improper EITC payments each year, and that is disturbing.”
Mr. George and their investigators said 21 percent to 25 percent of all EITC payments in 2012 were erroneous, meaning $11.6 billion to $13.6 billion was paid to people who shouldn't have received the credit, or received the wrong amount.
The EITC is a refundable tax credit designed to transfer money to the working poor through the tax system. It allows the working poor to pay less in taxes or, if they have no tax liability, to get money.
Both the IRS and the auditors agreed it is a complex program and checking eligibility is difficult.
The program is popular with many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who say it's an effective anti-poverty tool, rewarding those who work.
But the large error rate left some lawmakers questioning whether the agency will be able to administer the tens of billions of dollars in health care tax credits that are part of the Affordable Care Act.
“That the IRS can't figure out how to rein in the improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments doesn't bode well for the $1.1 trillion in ObamaCare subsidies,” said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee.
They said if the error rate in Obamacare subsidies is as big as it is in the EITC, that could mean $250 billion would be wasted in health care payments.
The size of the erroneous payments was staggering to lawmakers. At more than $13 billion a year, the bogus tax claims are more than the entire budget of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Interior or Labor departments.
“The waste outlined in this report — more than $13 billion a year — equals or exceeds the annual budgets of some federal agencies,” said Sen. Tom Coburn, Oklahoma Republican and Congress‘ chief waste-watcher. “Before we ask taxpayers to send even more of their own money to Washington, we must do more to prevent these egregious examples of waste.”
The IRS said it does try to crack down on bad EITC payments. Americans who claim the tax credit are already audited at twice the rate of other taxpayers.
“The IRS protects nearly $4 billion in improper claims each year and is committed to continuing to work to reduce improper claims,” the agency said in a statement.
The agency said it's working with the White House budget office to try to come up with other ways to weed out bad payments, and promised to soon comply with reporting requirements.
And it's already shown some progress in cutting the problem. In 2010, as much as 29 percent of EITC payments were erroneous, accounting for up to $18.4 billion.
Analysts said the large error rate stems from the complexity of the program, which leaves taxpayers confused about who is able to claim it.
Then there are the competing goals Congress and Mr. Obama have set.
For example, in a 2009 executive order the president told agencies to do more to make sure Americans know they are eligible for tax credits. But they also told agencies to crack down on bogus payments, laying out the reporting goals that the inspector general said the IRS is violating.

A newly-developed, highly accurate representation of the way in which neurons behave when performing movements such as reaching could not only enhance understanding of the complex dynamics at work in the brain, but aid in the development of robotic limbs which are capable of more complex and natural movements.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge, working in collaboration with the University of Oxford and the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), have developed a new model of a neural network, offering a novel theory of how neurons work together when performing complex movements. The results are published in the 18 June edition of the journal Neuron.
While an action such as reaching for a cup of coffee may seem straightforward, the millions of neurons in the brain's motor cortex must work together to prepare and execute the movement before the coffee ever reaches our lips. When we reach for the much-needed cup of coffee, the neurons spring into action, sending a series of signals from the brain to the hand. These signals are transmitted across synapses – the junctions between neurons.
Determining exactly how the neurons work together to execute these movements is difficult, however. The new theory was inspired by recent experiments carried out at Stanford University, which had uncovered some key aspects of the signals that neurons emit before, during and after the movement. “There is a remarkable synergy in the activity recorded simultaneously in hundreds of neurons,” said Dr Guillaume Hennequin of the University's Department of Engineering, who led the research. “In contrast, previous models of cortical circuit dynamics predict a lot of redundancy, and therefore poorly explain what happens in the motor cortex during movements.”
Better models of how neurons behave will not only aid in our understanding of the brain, but could also be used to design prosthetic limbs controlled via electrodes implanted in the brain. “Our theory could provide a more accurate guess of how neurons would want to signal both movement intention and execution to the robotic limb,” said Dr Hennequin.
The behaviour of neurons in the motor cortex can be likened to a mousetrap or a spring-loaded box, in which the springs are waiting to be released and are let go once the lid is opened or the mouse takes the bait. As we plan a movement, the ‘neural springs' are progressively flexed and compressed. When released, they orchestrate a series of neural activity bursts, all of which takes place in the blink of an eye.
The signals transmitted by the synapses in the motor cortex during complex movements can be either excitatory or inhibitory, which are in essence mirror reflections of each other. The signals cancel each other out for the most part, leaving occasional bursts of activity.
Using control theory, a branch of mathematics well-suited to the study of complex interacting systems such as the brain, the researchers devised a model of neural behaviour which achieves a balance between the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signals. The model can accurately reproduce a range of multidimensional movement patterns.
The researchers found that neurons in the motor cortex might not be wired together with nearly as much randomness as had been previously thought. “Our model shows that the inhibitory synapses might be tuned to stabilise the dynamics of these brain networks,” said Dr Hennequin. “We think that accurate models like these can really aid in the understanding of the incredibly complex dynamics at work in the human brain.”
Future directions for the research include building a more realistic, ‘closed-loop' model of movement generation in which feedback from the limbs is actively used by the brain to correct for small errors in movement execution. This will expose the new theory to the more thorough scrutiny of physiological and behavioural validation, potentially leading to a more complete mechanistic understanding of complex movements.
Washington (CNN) The US Secret Service is investigating comments made online by a Missouri state lawmaker who reportedly said they hoped President Donald Trump would be assassinated.
Democratic State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal's comment has since been deleted -- but it did not go unnoticed.
"The St. Louis Field Office of the Secret Service is looking into the comments," Secret Service spokesperson Cathy Milhoan said in a statement to CNN. "The Secret Service investigates all threats against the President, Vice President, and other protectees, whether they be direct, implied or comments in passing.
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Chappelle-Nadal's comment said: "I hope Trump is assassinated!"
They have since deleted the comment and apologized for the language they used, telling CNN affiliate KMOV that the comment arose from their frustration with the current political climate.
"No, I don't want to see anyone assassinated, but they should not be president, they should be impeached," Chapelle-Nadal told KMOV. "Someone wrote a statement on my Facebook and I responded with something that shouldn't have been put up there."
Lawmakers in the state quickly spoke out against the remark and called for the General Assembly member's resignation.
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, a fellow Democrat, said in a statement: "I condemn it. It's outrageous. And they should resign."
Stephen Webber, chairperson of the Missouri Democratic Party, said: "State Senator Chappelle-Nadal's comments are indefensible. All sides need to agree that there is no room for suggestions of political violence in America -- and the Missouri Democratic Party will absolutely not tolerate calls for the assassination of the President. I believe they should resign."
Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens also demanded they resign in a statement, according to the Post-Dispatch.
"We can have differences in our country, but no one should encourage political violence. The senator should resign," Greitens said.
Chappelle-Nadal's controversial comment comes amid a week of division and chaos in the US following a weekend of unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia surrounding a white supremacist rally. On Saturday, a car drove through a crowd of counter-protesters, resulting in the death of one woman and injuring several other people.
Trump was criticized for their initial response, condemning violence on "many sides," then on Monday they specifically condemned the white supremacist groups. But on Tuesday, when speaking with reporters, they echoed their initial comment and placed the blame again on "both sides."
"I think there is blame on both sides," Trump said.
Chappelle-Nadal posted their comment on Thursday morning, then was rejecting calls for them to resign by Thursday night.
"I am not resigning. When POC are respected by this WH & they are willing to do real work, I'll sit down with them. People are traumatized!" Chappelle-Nadal tweeted.

Modern humans appear in the fossil record about 200,000 years ago, but it was only about 50,000 years ago that making art and advanced tools became widespread.A new study appearing Aug. 1 in the journal Current Anthropology finds that human skulls changed in ways that indicate a lowering of testosterone levels at around the same time that culture was blossoming."The modern human behaviors of technological innovation, making art and rapid cultural exchange probably came at the same time that we developed a more cooperative temperament," said lead author Robert Cieri, a biology graduate student at the University of Utah who began this work as a senior at Duke University.The study, which is based on measurements of more than 1,400 ancient and modern skulls, makes the argument that human society advanced when people started being nicer to each other, which entails having a little less testosterone in action.Heavy brows were out, rounder heads were in, and those changes can be traced directly to testosterone levels acting on the skeleton, according to Duke anthropologist Steven Churchill, who supervised Cieri's work on a senior honors thesis that grew to become this 24-page journal article three years later.What they can't tell from the bones is whether these humans had less testosterone in circulation, or fewer receptors for the hormone.The research team also included Duke animal cognition researchers Brian Hare and Jingzhi Tan, who say this argument is in line with what has been established in non-human species.In a classic study of Siberian foxes, animals that were less wary and less aggressive toward humans took on a different, more juvenile appearance and behavior after several generations of selective breeding."If we're seeing a process that leads to these changes in other animals, it might help explain who we are and how we got to be this way," said Hare, who also studies differences between our closest ape relatives -- aggressive chimpanzees and mellow, free-loving bonobos.Those two apes develop differently, Hare said, and they respond to social stress differently. Chimpanzee males experience a strong rise in testosterone during puberty, but bonobos do not. When stressed, the bonobos don't produce more testosterone, as chimps do, but they do produce more cortisol, the stress hormone.Their social interactions are profoundly different and, relevant to this finding, their faces are different, too. "It's very hard to find a brow-ridge in a bonobo," Hare said.Cieri compared the brow ridge, facial shape and interior volume of 13 modern human skulls older than 80,000 years, 41 skulls from 10,000 to 38,000 years ago, and a global sample of 1,367 20th century skulls from 30 different ethnic populations. Lead Author T'11 Learned to Love Research at Duke When Bob Cieri first arrived at Duke, they envisioned becoming an ecologist who worked in the field, not someone who'd flourish in a lab.
For a senior honors thesis at Duke that became an academic paper 3 years later, Robert Cieri used facial measurements from more than 1,400 ancient and modern human skulls. Some of the measurements they made himself; others were taken from previous studies. (Robert Cieri, University of Utah)
The trend that emerged was toward a reduction in the brow ridge and a shortening of the upper face, traits which generally reflect a reduction in the action of testosterone.There are a lot of theories about why, after 150,000 years of existence, humans suddenly leapt forward in technology. Around 50,000 years ago, there is widespread evidence of producing bone and antler tools, heat-treated and flaked flint, projectile weapons, grindstones, fishing and birding equipment and a command of fire. Was this driven by a brain mutation, cooked foods, the advent of language or just population density?The Duke study argues that living together and cooperating put a premium on agreeableness and lowered aggression and that, in turn, led to changed faces and more cultural exchange."If prehistoric people began living closer together and passing down new technologies, they'd have to be tolerant of each other," Cieri said. "The key to our success is the ability to cooperate and get along and learn from one another."This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (SBR-9312567), the Leakey Foundation and the University of Iowa Orthodontics Department.
The joint statement was issued by LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar and Yashwant Sinha.
LK Advani and three other veteran BJP leaders have issued a lacerating statement on the party's defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, demanding a thorough review and criticising its stand on the debacle.
"The results of Bihar election show that no lesson has been learnt from fiasco in Delhi," said the statement, signed by Mr Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar and Yashwant Sinha, all 80 plus leaders sidelined by the party since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah took charge of it.
The statement, which sources said was drafted in less than 10 minutes after the leaders met at the Delhi residence of Mr Joshi this evening, does not name PM Modi or Mr Shah, who led the party's strategy and campaign for the Bihar elections, but censures their leadership unambiguously and in strong words.
"To say everyone is responsible for defeat in Bihar is to ensure no one is held responsible. It shows those who would have appropriated credit are bent on shrugging off responsibility for the disastrous showing in Bihar," the leaders said.
"A principal reason for the latest defeat is the way the party has been emasculated in the last year... A thorough review must be done of the reasons for the defeat as well as the way the party is being forced to kowtow to a handful and how its consensual character has been destroyed," the statement added.
That review, it said, "must not be done by the very persons who have managed and who have been responsible for the campaign in Bihar."
Later at night, the BJP released a counter statement issued by three former BJP leaders- Rajnath Singh, M Venkaiah Naidu and Nitin Gadkari to lend credibility. The statement took a dig at the senior rebels by reminding them that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr Advani had set a "healthy precedent of the party collectively taking up responsibility for victories and defeats." The subtle barb was aimed at Mr Advani who was the BJP's prime ministerial candidate when the party lost 2009 elections.
On Sunday, the BJP had learned that it had won only 58 seats along with it allies, defeated emphatically by the Nitish Kumar-led Grand Alliance, which has got 178 seats, an absolute majority in Bihar.
On Monday, the group of 12 top BJP leaders called the parliamentary board, which includes PM Modi and Mr Shah, met and assessed that no one could be blamed for the Bihar defeat; they said the party had failed the gauge the mood in the state. Senior leaders like Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley have said no blame can be attached to the Prime Minister.
I don't want people to think that I left just because of the social media. It was because I can't stay somewhere where I feel like I'm being forced into something that I'm not, or I feel like I'm not wanted by my own principal... I'm not a bad student. I really want to try and change this. I think it's ridiculous that in this day and age you can be excluded from your own school for being gay. When I came out I knew I was going to have bullies and I knew people were not going to be okay with it. But I never expected it to be from the people who were supposed to protect you from the bullies. Who were supposed to try to stop that. And then they themselves are the bullies.
It began with a simple idea: I asked women I knew if they would write their experiences of street harassment on a T-shirt. Two fellow women's rights activists from NOW-NYC and I were preparing a spoken word performance for the NYC Anti-Street Harassment Rally, and we thought it would be incredibly powerful if, during the performance, we each allowed our bodies to carry the proverbial weight of all that women endure as they attempt to navigate their daily lives — walking home or to work or to school, riding the bus or the subway, eating a meal at a restaurant or having a drink at a bar — amid the ever-present threat of street harassment.
What started out as a small project blossomed, as more and more women began to share their experiences with me. The ink of their markers bled into the fabric, permanently inscribing on my shirt thirty-eight stories of street harassment written in sixteen languages: Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic, Chinese, Danish, English, French, Hindi, Italian, Jamaican Patois, Lebanese, Moroccan, Nepali, Serbian, Spanish, and Tagalog.
The examples they provided range from the cruel to the vulgar, from the heartbreaking to the violent. What too many women know — and what too many of these writings encapsulate — is that statements harassers often pass off as innocent or even complimentary can escalate to violence all too quickly should the intended recipient reject those advances.
Collectively, these stories provide a multicultural demonstration of how street harassment is a global problem, a demonstration of how far we still have to go before every woman, everywhere, can feel safe and respected in their own body — and as they move within that body to navigate the public spaces where they live their life — as is them right.
In recent months, Chinese leaders have taken the mantle to defend free trade
Doing business in China remains difficult for many European companies and most are still being treated unfairly, a lobby group said Wednesday, undermining Beijing's claims that it welcomes foreign investment.China is facing growing pressure to provide a level playing field and increase market access for overseas firms who have long complained about the country's hostile and biased business environment.The survey comes ahead of an EU-China talks in Brussels on Thursday where two-way investment and trade will be high on the agenda.In recent months Chinese leaders have taken the mantle to defend free trade and denounce protectionism as the United States retreats into "America First" policies under Donald Trump.But the results of the latest business confidence survey by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China suggest Beijing has a long way to go before its rhetoric matches reality.Forty-nine percent of the 570 respondents said operating in China became more difficult in 2016, a slight pick-up from the previous year's reading of 56 percent.But 45 percent said conditions were "about the same", up from 38 percent a year earlier.A steady six percent said there had been an improvement.And 54 percent said foreign-invested companies were treated unfairly compared with their Chinese competitors, little changed from previous years.That was particularly obvious in environmental regulation, with the vast majority of European companies saying foreign firms were subjected to far more stringent enforcement than Chinese enterprises.More than half said there had been no increase in market access in their industry, unchanged from the previous survey."European companies are not afraid of competition, they just want to compete on a level playing field," said Mats Harborn, president of the lobby group.Of the companies polled, most of whom have been in China for more than 10 years, half said they felt less welcome than when they first entered the Chinese market.Competition is also intensifying with 60 percent of European companies expecting Chinese firms to close the "innovation gap" by around 2020."Chinese firms are catching up," said Harborn."The Chinese government should feel comfortable that it does not need to protect its industries."Looking beyond 2017 European companies are largely pessimistic, with only 15 percent expecting regulatory obstacles to decrease and 40 percent expecting the situation to worsen.
I thought it would be interesting to make a list to go along with Top 10 gruesome methods of execution and Top 10 modern methods of execution. This list includes individuals that came face to face with death and their execution devices and because of fate or just plain luck were able to survive and live another day.
10 Elizabeth Proctor circa 1652
In 1692 Elizabeth Proctor and their husband John were accused of witchcraft in the Salem Witch Trials. After their arrest the court met in Salem to discuss the fate of John and Elizabeth and several others. In spite of the petitions and testimonies from friends, both John and Elizabeth were found guilty, and were sentenced to death. Elizabeth, who was pregnant at the time, was granted a stay of execution until after the birth of the baby. John tried to postpone their execution, but failed. On August 19, 1692, their husband was executed. In January 1693 while still in prison, Elizabeth gave birth to a son whom they named John after their father. For some reason, Elizabeth was not executed as the court had ordered and then in 1693 the Governor, believing that people were being wrongly convicted without hard evidence, ordered 153 people set free. Elizabeth was among this general release of prisoners.
Interesting Fact: Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned during the Salam Witch Trials. The two courts convicted twenty-nine people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused (fourteen women and five men) were hanged. One man who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force them to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.
9 John Henry George Lee 1864 – circa 1945
In 1884 at their home at Torquay England, Miss Emma Keyse was bludgeoned to death with an axe, their throat slashed with a knife and their house set on fire. John Lee, who was one of the servants at the house was arrested and convicted of their murder and sentenced to death by hanging. The date for the hanging was set for February 23rd 1885 at the Exeter Prison. When Lee was standing at the gallows waiting to die the trap door release malfunctioned. Not just once, not twice, but three times! Amid the confusion of these botched attempts Lee was returned to their cell and at some later time the Home Secretary reduced their sentence to life imprisonment with the recommendation that they never be released.
Interesting Fact: After some 23 years in prison Lee (now aged 41) due to constant pressure to review their case, was released in December 1907. Ironically it was suggested that this was not because the merits of the case justified a review but because of the infamous bungle which was made in attempting to hang him.
8 William Duell 1724
In 1740, 16 year old William Duell was convicted of raping and murdering a girl in the village of Tyburn, London. Duell was sentenced to death by hanged along with 4 others. During this time period bodies of criminals were regularly provided to medical training colleges so after the execution Duell's body was brought to Surgeons' Hall to be anatomized. After they were stripped and laid on the board one of the servants noticed they were breathing. After Duell's breath became quicker and quicker the surgeon took some blood from them and in two hours they were able to sit up in their chair. That evening the authorities decided to reprieve them and their sentence was commuted to transportation.
Interesting Fact: Tyburn was commonly invoked in euphemisms for capital punishment – for instance, “to take a ride to Tyburn” was to go to one's hanging.
7 Zoleykhah Kadkhoda born 1977
In 1997 20-year-old Zoleykhah Kadkhoda was arrested and charged with engaging in sexual relations outside marriage. They were immediately sentenced to death by stoning. Kadkhoda was then buried up to their waist in preparation for their execution but soon after the stoning began it prompted great reaction among most of the village inhabitants which caused the stoning to stop. It was first thought that the woman had died and was taken to the morgue but then began to breath again and was taken to the hospital. Them condition improved and an appeal for amnesty was submitted to the court on their behalf.
Interesting Fact: The Iranian authorities informed Amnesty International that the death sentence against Zoleykhah Kadkhoda has been lifted and that they were released on 26 November 1997.
6 Wenseslao Moguel circa 1880
On March 18, 1915 Wenseslao Moguel was captured while fighting in the Mexican revolution. Without trial they were sentenced to be executed by firing squad. Moguel was shot 9 times including a final bullet through their head at close range by an officer to insure death. Moguel somehow survived and managed to escape. Wenseslao went on to live a full life after their “execution”. The above photo shows Moguel in 1937 on the Ripley's Believe It Or Not radio show pointing to their scar from the bullet that was shot at close range.
Interesting Fact: A popular song was written about Wenseslao Moguel. You can listen to it here.
5 John Smith circa 1690
John Smith, from England was convicted of robbery and was sentenced to death by hanging at Tyburn. On Christmas Eve 1705, having been turned off the back of the cart, they dangled for 15 minutes until the crowd began to shout “reprieve” and was then cut down and taken to a nearby house where they soon recovered. When Smith was asked what it had felt like to be hanged this is what they told their rescuers: “When I was turned off I was, for some time, sensible of very great pain occasioned by the weight of my body and felt my spirits in strange commotion, violently pressing upwards. Having forced their way to my head I saw a great blaze or glaring light that seemed to go out of my eyes in a flash and then I lost all sense of pain. After I was cut down, I began to come to myself and the blood and spirits forcing themselves into their former channels put me by a prickling or shooting into such intolerable pain that I could have wished those hanged who had cut me down”.
Interesting Fact: The 1747 drawing above by William Hogarth shows the condemned travelling in carts with their coffins to Tyburn infamous “Triple Tree” tripod-shaped gallows. The grandstands which were named “Mother Procter's Pews” were erected for the hundreds of spectators that would come out to see a public hanging.
4 Anne Green circa 1630
Anne Green was a 22 year old woman from England who was most likely seduced by the grandson of their employer. When Green became pregnant they hid their pregnancy and gave birth to a premature baby boy who died soon after they were born. After trying unsuccessfully to hide the child's body Green was accused of the murder and was sentenced to death by hanging. During the execution Anne Green had to climb the ladder up to the gallows where the rope was laid around their neck and then was pushed off the ladder. After about half an hour their body was cut down and placed in a coffin and taken to a local doctor who gave anatomy lectures at the university. When the doctors and others assembled for the dissection and opened the coffin they noticed that the ”corpse ”took a breath and they heard sounds coming from their throat.” After giving their hot drinks they opened their eyes. The treatment continued with bloodletting and twelve hours after the execution Anne Green was able to say a few words. After their unique rescue the court usher attending the execution and the prison director of Oxford agreed that Anne Green should be reprieved. Green later married, had three children and lived for fifteen years after their famous execution.
Interesting Fact: During this time period it was common for people to grab onto the legs of the condemned with all their weight causing a forceful downward jerk so that the hanged person would die as quickly as possible. It was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that hanging in England was done with a fall to break the neck.
3 Joseph Samuel circa 1780
Joseph Samuel was born in England and later transported to Australia after committing a robbery in 1801. Samuel then became involved in a gang in Sydney and robbed the home of a wealthy woman. A police officer who had been sent to protect their home was murdered. The gang was soon caught and at the trial Joseph Samuel confessed to stealing the goods but denied being part of the murder. The leader of the gang was released due to lack of evidence and Joseph Samuel was sentenced to death by hanging. In 1803, Samuel and another criminal were driven in a cart to Parramatta where hundreds of people came to watch the hanging. After praying, the cart on which they were standing drove off, but instead of being hanged, the rope around Samuel's neck snapped! The executioner tried again. This time, the rope slipped and their legs touched the ground. With the crowd in an uproar, the executioner tried for the third time and the rope snapped again. This time, an officer galloped off to tell the Governor what had happened and their sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. The Governor and others believed that it was a sign from God that Samuel should not be hanged.
Interesting Fact: Samuel was one of Australia's earliest Jewish settlers and became known as the man they could not hang.
2 Maggie Dickson circa 1700
Maggie Dickson lived in Edinburgh Scotland in the early eighteenth century. Them story is remarkably similar to Anne Green's.(#4) After their husband deserted them in 1723 they were forced to move further south to Kelso near the Scottish Borders. They worked for an innkeeper in return for basic lodgings and started an affair with the Innkeeper's son which led to them becoming pregnant. Not wanting the innkeeper to discover this because it would surely lead to their dismissal they concealed their pregnancy as long as possible. The baby was born prematurely and died within a few days of being born. They then planned to put the baby into the River Tweed but couldn't bring themselves to and finally left it on the riverbank. The same day the baby was discovered and traced to Maggie and in 1724 they were charged under the contravention of the Concealment of Pregnancy. Maggie was taken back to Grasssmarket for their public execution by hanging. After the hanging they were pronounced dead and their body was bound for Musselburgh where they were to be buried, however the journey was interrupted by a knocking and banging from within the wooden coffin. The lid was lifted to find Maggie alive and well. The law saw it as God's will and they were freed to live for another forty years.
Interesting Fact: Maggie became something of a local celebrity and the locals gave them the nickname ‘Half Hangit' Maggie.' The pub pictured above is a well-established and popular macabre themed watering hole in Edinburgh and is named after Maggie Dickson.
1 Willie Francis 1929 – 1947
In 1945 Willie Francis at age 16 was charged with murder of a drugstore owner in St. Martinville Louisiana. The murder went unsolved for nine months until Francis was detained due to an unrelated crime. Police claimed they were carrying the wallet of the drugstore owner in their pocket. A short time later, Francis confessed to the murder in writing after they were interrogated. They later directed the police to where he'd disposed of the holster used to carry the murder weapon. Despite two separate written confessions, Francis pleaded not guilty. The state-appointed defense attorneys offered no objections, called no witnesses and put up no defense. Two days after the trial began; Francis was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death by the electric chair. On May 3, 1946 during the execution as the lethal surge of electricity was being applied witnesses reported hearing the teenager scream “Take it off! Take it off! Let me breathe! “. Another report states that they said “I'm n-not dying!” The electric chair failed to kill Willie Francis. It turned out that the portable electric chair had been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard.
Interesting Fact: After the botched execution, Francis appealed to the Supreme Court citing various violations of their Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The appeal was rejected and Willie Francis was executed on May 9, 1947 over a year after their first execution.

At long last, the taco emoji is a reality. Emojipedia on Tuesday announced 37 new emojis to be included in Unicode 8.0, headlined by a little corn tortilla with fillings. The new emojis will be officially released on Wednesday.
Joining the taco in the latest update of Unicode are burrito, cheese wedge, hot dog, popcorn, and "bottle with a popping cork" emojis. All in all, it's a great victory for the food-savvy texter who hates being forced to use pesky words.
The Unicode update doesn't guarantee the new emojis will be adopted across mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android, but as Quartz notes, it's likely that at least some of the emojis will show up on those platforms.
In January, Taco Bell started a Change.org petition in an effort to bring the taco emoji to life, collecting more than 25,000 signatures. If the emoji is in fact adopted by iOS, it could spell doom for the platform's taco texting app, which launched last September.
Eater Video: Hugh Aceson makes Kris Jenner's nachos
Do people still say “the bomb” anymore? Probably not. Oh well, I've never been trendy, and it's too late to start now! :) Perhaps this week, as you plan out what you will do for Easter, you are thinking about what to serve for dessert. And if you are, let me humbly suggest this masterpiece of a cake. I found it on allrecipes.com, where I've found most of my favorite recipes by searching through their five-star ratings.
I first made this delight a few years ago for Mother's Day, when tasked to bring “an amazing dessert”. This cake delivered. My mother-in-law talked about it for months afterwards!
This cake has all of the elements to be a blockbuster success: mascarpone cheese, coffee, Kahlua, heavy cream, more Kahlua… so very, very good. :)
I'm not a food blogger, so I didn't do that cool step-by-step picture thing. I've tried that before, but I always forget after step 6 or 7, throw it all together, and then barely remember to take a photo of the final product. So. Here's the recipe.
Ingredients: (don't be scared by the long list. A lot of the items are repeated. Also? This is one of the recipes where you shouldn't skimp or substitute. Go with the good stuff.)
CAKE:
1 (18.25 ounce) package moist white cake
1 tsp. instant coffee powder
1/4 c. brewed coffee (I use French vanilla coffee for this and it's divine.)
1 Tbsp. Kahlua
FILLING:
1 (8oz) container of mascarpone cheese
1/2 c. confectioner's sugar
2 Tbsp. Kahlua
FROSTING:
2 c. heavy cream
1/4 c. confectioner's sugar
2 Tbsp. Kahlua
GARNISH:
2 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder
1 (1 oz)square of semi sweetened chocolate.
Directions:
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour three 9-inch cake pans. Prepare your cake mix according to the directions. Divide 2/3 of the batter between 2 pans, and then stir the instant coffee into the remaining batter. Pour into last pan. Bake in oven for about 20-25 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then remove from pan and cool on a wire rack until completely cool. Combine your brewed coffee and 1 Tbsp of the Kahlua, set aside. For the filling: In a small bowl, with mixer on low, combine mascarpone, 1/2 c. confec. sugar and 2 Tbsp. of Kahlua; beat just until it gets smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. For the Frosting: In a medium bowl, beat cream, 1/4 c. of confec. sugar and 2 Tbsp of Kahlua with mixer on med-high until stiff. This will take about 10 minutes. Fold 1/2 cup of this cream mixture into the filling. To assemble: Place one plain layer cake on a plate. Poke holes in cake with a skewer, about an inch apart. Pour one third of the reserved coffee mixture over cake, then spread with half the filling mixture. Top with coffee flavored cake, repeat holes and pour another third of the coffee mixture over this layer. Spread with remaining filling. Top with remaining cake layer, poke holes, pour rest of coffee mixture over the top. Spread top and sides of cake with frosting. Place cocoa in a sieve and lightly dust the top of the cake. Shave chocolate square into curls and garnish top of cake. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
I know it seems like a lot of work. It will take a while, but if you make the filling and the frosting while the cakes are baking, it really cuts down on the length of time. And because you can't taste something through a computer screen, you'll just have to trust me that it's that good. Worth the time and the extra ingredients. I am now considering making this on Saturday for our family brunch. :)
Ahmadinejad slams push for Islamic life

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has spoken out against the use of pressure to impose Islamic values on people, especially university candidates, media reported.“You cannot impose things by issuing decrees and directives, a choice imposed by force has no value whatsoever,” Ahmadinejad said in a speech on Dec. 30.“In some universities, female students are forced to wear the chador [covering the whole body, leaving only the face exposed], but the way they are forced to wear it ... it is better not worn since it becomes worthless,” they said. They also criticized criteria on the selection of university candidates, citing the case of a student denied university admittance in the 1980s because they had shaved.Ahmadinejad also mentioned another case of a girl refused a university place because they had “talked to a boy in the street and had their headscarf back an inch,” thereby showing them hair. They said that after they intervened in both cases they were granted places.Ahmadinejad also denounced some of the questions posed to candidates during interviews for government jobs.“We have asked people if they drank alcohol or have illicit sexual relations. This is an insult and goes against religion.”
MTA/Wikipedia/CityLab
A forensic transit scientist says the MTA needs timetables its human operators can manage.
On a recent Monday afternoon at Grand Central Station, strings of subway cars clatter up to the 4/5/6 platform. As trains arrive every four minutes or so, doors open and shut quickly, rarely parting longer than the 10 seconds they're supposed to. They stick to schedule. But as afternoon melts into evening, larger numbers of passengers surge onto the platform. “Dwell times” brim over their scheduled mark, as doors linger open and conductors bark at riders to press toward the center of the car. As trains hang longer than they're supposed to at successive stations, running times stretch further and further past what's planned. The steady accretion of micro-delays during peak hours can unleash all manner of subway chaos. But it's not necessarily the fault of the drivers. “On every line I have studied, they've under-scheduled the peak,” says Adam Rahbee. In other words, it's not just that operators are driving behind schedule. Schedules are going too fast for the operators.
Wearing salmon shorts and a thick wrist watch when I meet them at Grand Central, Rahbee sports a slightly nervous grin that belies their expert confidence. He's an MIT-trained metro rail researcher who has worked inside some of the busiest systems in Europe and North America. A self-proclaimed “forensic” transit analyst, they have scrutinized archival data for 23 subway lines in Boston, Chicago, and London, looking to understand how and why delays crop up. Rahbee has also served as a peer expert for the U.S. DOT, published dozens of papers, operated CTA trains, and interviewed drivers, dispatchers, and service planners around the world. And they believe they have a solution to New York City's subway meltdown: Rewrite the timetables. Here's the idea: Drivers and dispatchers have their idiosyncratic habits to adapt to rising ridership and signal breakdowns. Crunched and harried as they make round trips, they're also losing minutes to meet their basic needs. The tiny delays this creates can cascade into bigger ones later in the day, feeding a more general system-wide collapse. It's the human side of the subway's problems that no one is talking about. And it might be a lot cheaper to fix than new subway cars. *** One hundred and thirty years ago, North American railroad engineers standardized time zones to impose temporal order over a vast continent, and avoid crashing trains into each other. Not long after, the New York City subway set the world standard for glorious, 24-hour service.
These days, human-driven rail in NYC is feeling its age. In the first four months of 2017, just 63 percent of the city's subway cars arrived at the end of their lines within five minutes of their scheduled times—bringing “on-time performance” down 21 percentage points since 2012. The effects on passengers are well documented: Lost time means lost appointments, jobs, and wages, perhaps billions of dollars annually. Crumbling infrastructure, nonstop construction, signal slow-downs, labor costs, and riders themselves are the oft-heard explanations for why the trains can't run on time. Cities are changing fast. Keep up with the CityLab Daily newsletter. The best way to follow issues you care about. Subscribe Loading... But there's another, largely overlooked element that is worth paying attention to, some operators and analysts say. Even in the absence of signal failures, door-holding, and sick passengers creating delays, drivers are struggling more than ever to stick to the scheduled running times on the busiest lines. Not only do timetables measure delays (i.e., whether trains are arriving “on time”), they may also be causing them—because people are not machines. As conductors hold trains a little “too long” to accommodate rush hour crowds, operators run out of scheduled time at the end of the line. To maximize efficiency, timetables generally allow no more than a handful of minutes of “recovery time” for trains to turn around and head back into service. That's usually when operators are supposed to receive breaks. “The subway is like a chessboard. There is only so much room, and you can only move the pieces a certain way.” But if a train arrives at its terminus significantly later than scheduled, the operator still has to depart for their return trip on time. That means they might have to forgo their break—which can wind up dragging down trains further down the line. “Let's say I'm halfway through my return trip, and I absolutely have to go the bathroom,” says Noah Rodriguez, an MTA train operator on release from their regular route on the 6 train, one of the worst-performing lines in the system. (Rodriguez currently works for TWU Local 100, which represents operators.) “I've got to get off the train, secure it,” they say. “Now, that train has to wait for me.”
Drivers who hold trains for badly needed breaks—or stop their train and unload passengers because they have to clock out for the day, which can also happen—catch dispatchers off guard, and can easily create a cascade of delays. Think of New York City's subway system like branching pipes: A clog on one line often means restricted flow on at least one other, further upstream. Hold-ups resulting from tight timetables are common on some lines. In their experience on the 6 train, “that kind of thing happened daily,” says Rodriguez. “We can never stick to the schedule,” says Marcia Lane, a 7 train operator. So, if drivers are rarely on time, why do schedules exist at all? Would there even be delays to measure if they didn't? This might sound like a stoner reverie. Passengers don't care about schedules; they just want to know that there's a train coming soon. Timetables, however, do matter to planners, dispatchers, and operators. They determine the number of trains that can be in service at a given time, help manage signal timings and employee hours, and prevent collisions. “The subway is like a chessboard,” says Rahbee. “There is only so much room, and you can only move the pieces a certain way.” MTA service planners review schedules every six months. Sometimes they make revisions, using inputs such as ridership counts, train speeds, and car lengths. They do so with the knowledge that the times are a little more optimistic than reality permits. Union contracts don't really incentivize speedy performance; in some ways, planners design timetables to keep drivers on their toes. “We're human beings,” says Phua. “We're not robots.” It's hard to finger any single factor in the subway's dismal performance with a degree of magnitude. But systemwide construction-related disruption, failing signals, aging cars, and rising ridership counts may be amplifying the deleterious effects of overly ambitious schedules. The union has taken note. Kia Phua, the vice president of rapid transit operations at TWU Local 100, says unbreathable schedules have become a performance issue in the past two years. Operators pressed to keep driving without rest might run at slower speeds, accidentally hit emergency brakes, or fail to read signals correctly. Some have filed grievances with the MTA.
“We're human beings,” says Phua. “We're not robots.” Phua says the MTA is working with TWU to solve the break time issue, which may include reducing trains on certain lines. That gets closer to what Rahbee sees as the problem, which is bigger than any particular labor policy. To him, lost break times are a symptom of a schedule that doesn't allow enough room for humanity. As an analyst in the planning department of the London Underground in 2006, Rahbee found the same issues on some of the most notoriously congested lines. For the Northern Line—known to Londoners as the “misery line”—Rahbee created hyper-detailed time-distance charts that showed a predictable pattern: delays cascaded from unrealistic running times. They spent months interviewing operators and dispatchers about how they worked to adapt. Rahbee's findings mirrored what MTA operators describe: London workers came up with their own processes to cope with insufficient running times, which didn't necessarily get reported back to service planners. The solution, Rahbee and a few other colleagues believed, was to write a timetable that actually reflected operators' working environment—and to build communication between those writing the schedules and those trying to adhere to them. London planners were reticent to let go of the old input-output models that they, like many agencies, had used for decades to create schedules. As Rahbee recounts in a 300-page, self-published tome outlining their findings, tensions ran high as a result of the proposed changes. Rahbee resigned from their position in 2008, largely for health reasons. But the agency took their advice to redesign the timetables, and saw smoother service as a result. The Tube has continued to see reliability improve.
Rahbee sees their exhaustive, bottom-up approach—which they developed over previous jobs in Boston and Chicago—as an honest way to understand the embedded frailties of a human-run subway system. They plan to pitch such an analysis to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's “Genius Transit Challenge,” which will award $1 million to out-of-the-box ideas to fix NYC's ailing system. If MTA planners reimagined the scheduling process through rigorous data analysis and investigation of its practical operations, they guess it could bring on-time performance on certain lines within the 90 percent range. Clearly, the subway's problems are not limited to its schedules. But even if such revisions improved service moderately, the return on investment could be huge. Today's “big data” processing software makes digging into the where, when, and why of transit delays much easier than in Rahbee's early days. Compared to the multi-billion dollar capital investments the system requires, tweaking the timetables would be virtually free. Unfortunately, politics may be preventing it. Adding more running time where it's needed might lead to smoother, more reliable service. But it could also mean fewer, more evenly spaced trains on the tracks, which would look a lot like “less” service on paper. Compared to multi-billion dollar capital investments, redesigning timetables would be virtually free. “It's almost an admission of defeat,” says Zak Accuardi, an analyst at TransitCenter, the transit research and advocacy group. But Accuardi agrees that problems with schedules need to be accounted for. “Without acknowledging those kinds of challenges, it's hard to encourage elected officials to make big changes the system needs.” MTA representatives did not return requests for comment for this story, citing a lack of time due to an agency-wide audit underway.
*** This admission of defeat is, in effect, an admission of humanity. In July, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced an $800 million plan to rescue the system, with steps that include adding extra cars to some lines, stripping seats to make more room, and hastening signal and track repairs across the system. But fixing the system also requires reckoning with its biological elements. Signals, cars, and tracks don't make the subway run. People do. At least for now. Metro rail systems are due for a mechanized takeover, arguably even more so than private cars. London and Paris are gradually automating their systems, as dozens of cities (and airports) already have. But apart from the AirTrain at JFK, New York City has only one, semi-automated line—the L train. It's also the most reliable subway line in the city.
Rahbee has spent their career exposing the human weaknesses of rail systems with remarkable empathy. But they are all for automating the New York City subway. “Getting rid of the human issues eliminates a lot of reliability issues,” they say. “Spend more, but save so much in operating cost—and put all that savings into running higher frequencies.” At the end of the day, every transit crusader loves efficiency. The MTA hasn't pushed very hard to spread driverless operations, largely because of the strength of unions. But if the whole system were automated, lunches and bathroom breaks wouldn't matter. The subway wouldn't even need timetables to run; driverless trains can operate on headways instead. Such a transformation may be decades away—but it must come, if New York City transit hopes to continue serving the millions of riders whose lives rely on it. Until then, though, the trains will be driven by people. The schedules might do better to acknowledge it.
Two airline crew members used a public defibrillator to save a passenger whose heart stopped at Edmonton International Airport on Wednesday.
The man collapsed around 3:45 p.m. after walking off a plane that had just arrived from Arizona.
WestJet flight attendant Guy Fournier heard an alarm in the U.S. arrivals area and noticed that a woman had opened one of the defibrillators on the wall.
”There was no time to think, “OK, should I do this? Is this right to do?'” Fournier recounted Thursday. “No. We're trained to do this."
Defibrillator use was demonstrated during an event at Edmonton International Airport last August. (CBC)
Fournier ran over and determined the man was not breathing. A flight attendant from another airline pulled the defibrillator off the wall and brought it over.
“We administered a shock,” Fournier said. “The follow-up was, we had to do CPR, in between the shocks.”
After Fournier administered two breaths, the man started gasping for air and started to breathe on their own.
Shortly afterwards, EMS and firefighters arrived and everyone was escorted out of the area, leaving Fournier to wonder how the man was doing.
65 AEDs throughout the airport
Heather Hamilton, spokesperson for Edmonton Airports, says the flight attendants' actions saved the man's life.
“That person would not have made it without that shock,” they said. ”So definitely a save for our defibrillators.”
Edmonton International Airport has 65 automated external defibrillators or AEDs throughout the terminals.
“We've had four saves since 2009, including this one,” said airport Fire Chief Burl Hamn.
Although Fournier and the other crew member are trained in CPR and defibrillator use, the AEDs talk people without any experience through the process.
“The thing tells you what to do,” they said. “Anybody could have used it.”
Fournier describes the experience as surreal, but they were happy to hear that the man and their family are doing well.
“I wish them a Happy holiday and I wish them all the best,” Fournier said. “I'm so glad that they are doing well.”
At least two sunken Dutch warships have vanished from the bottom of the Java Sea.
According to Dutch News, three warships that sunk during the 1942 Battle of the Java Sea “have largely disappeared from the sea bed.”
Defence Minister Jeanine Hennis told members of parliament that two sunken cruisers and a portion of a sunken destroyer have disappeared from the sea floor, likely as a result of illegal salvage, the Dutch News reported.
According to British newspaper The Guardian, the wrecks were first found by divers in 2002, and the missing wrecks were recently discovered during a diving expedition in preparation of the marking of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Java Sea.
“The wrecks of HNLMS De Ruyter and HNLMS Java have seemingly gone completely missing. A large piece is also missing of HNLMS Kortenaer,” the newspaper quoted the ministry of defence as saying.
Over 2,000 people died during the battle against the Japanese and the shipwrecks have been declared a war grave, according to The Guardian.
“An investigation has been launched to see what has happened to the wrecks, while the cabinet has been informed,” the defence ministry said. “The desecration of a war grave is a serious offence,” the ministry said in a statement.
According to Dutch News, illegal divers, sometimes posing as fishermen, have been stripping the wrecks of metal, selling it as scrap.
“The Battle for Java Sea is part of our collective memory,” Hennis said. “The wrecks bear silent witness to the tragic events and form a backdrop to the many stories about the terrors of war and the comradeship between crew.”
The Guardian reported that not only are Dutch wrecks disappearing but three British ships and a U.S. submarine have been destroyed as a result of scrap metal salvagers. The U.K. government has requested Indonesian officials to launch an investigation and take “appropriate action to protect the sites from any further disturbance.”
“Many lives were lost during this battle and we would expect that these sites are respected and left undisturbed without the express consent of the United Kingdom,” The Guardian quoted the ministry of defence as saying. “It is British Government policy that our military wrecks are offered appropriate protection and management.”
Broadway star Jennifer Holliday is the latest performer to back out of next week's presidential inauguration celebrations, saying they did not realize that their participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for president-elect Donald Trump.
The move comes a day after singer Paul Anka announced they would no longer be singing at the Jan. 20 ball, despite Trump being "an old friend" of his. Country star Toby Keith, the rock band 3 Doors Down and actor Jon Voight are still in the lineup to perform at inauguration events.
Anka, who had previously agreed to perform at the Inauguration Day gala for a "first dance" between Trump and their wife Melania, blamed a scheduling conflict for the cancellation. But Holliday, best known for their Tony-winning role in Broadway's Dreamgirls, said they did it to support their lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) fans.
Them reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to their fans. Them representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.
"My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I will not perform for the welcome concert or for any of the inauguration festivities!" they wrote.
"Please know that I hear you and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you," they added. "You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded."
Angry backlash
In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended their initial decision to perform.
"I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall," Holliday told the AP.
The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in The Color Purple, said they were hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott their music. Others called them "Uncle Tom" and there was even a suggestion that they take their own life.
How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? - Jennifer Holliday , singer
"It just really made my heart drop to my feet," Holliday said. "How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore."
Teen singer's transgender sister shows support
Holliday is not the only performer who has faced intense public pressure to back down from Thursday's concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.

Teen classical-crossover singer Jackie Evancho, best known for their appearance on America's Got Talent, has faced criticism for their decision to sing the national anthem.
The 16-year-old's transgender sister has recently come to their defence. Juliet Evancho appeared alongside Jackie on a CBS Sunday Morning segment set to air this weekend, saying their sister "is singing for our country and it's an honour for them to be singing in front of so many people."
Jackie Evancho told CBS they hope their performance will bring people together and "make everyone forgets about rivals and politics for a second."
Several other prominent entertainers have either declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities or indicated they would decline if asked to, including Elton John, Garth Brooks, Kanye West, Céline Dion, Moby, Charlotte Church, Ice-T, Andrea Bocelli and David Foster.
A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir resigned from the famed group over its decision to perform. The Radio City Rockettes are slated to perform, though the union representing the dancers has said participation is voluntary after some members of the troupe expressed discomfort with the decision.
Inauguration host snubbed after 60 years
One person who wanted to play a role at the event but won't is Charles Brotman, the 89-year-old who has announced every inauguration parade since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957.
CNN reported last week that Trump opted to break tradition and replace Brotman with Steve Ray, a 58-year-old Washington-based freelance announcer.
The veteran announcer found out about the snub in an email from Trump's team.
"I looked at my email, then I got the shock of my life," Brotman told CNN's Carol Costello. "I felt like Muhammad Ali had hit me in the stomach."
They told CNN they were so distraught they thought they "was going to commit suicide."
Netflix's Death Note Movie is getting a big reaction from fans of the original manga/anime, and needless to say, it's not all good. However, more so than the opinion of the fans, the opinion of Death Note's creators are going to hold the most weight. So what do they have to say about Netflix's film?
It may surprise some fans to learn that Death Note's creators actually like the Netflix movie - specifically for its change in approach to the lore. Anime News Network pulled together commentary from Death Note creators Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, which you can check out below.
Ohba is quoted as saying:
"It was more interesting than I expected. Every bit of it is high quality and very fashionable, it's definitely Hollywood's Death Note. I think a wide range of people can enjoy this movie, not just fans, because there are parts that follow the original work but also changes, too."
Obata apparently sees the opportunity for Death Note to reach (literal) new shores of fans, thanks to this new interpretation:
"I hope that people overseas who did not know Death Note until now can enjoy watching it on Netflix. Adam Wingard 's visual beauty and thrilling directorial are splendid, and create a class 'A' thriller. This is the kind of the Death Note I'd like to draw as well."
There was plenty for Jon Stewart to say about the GOP 2012 "autopsy" and the recent CPAC convention, but there are a few characters you can always rely on to steal the show... [cough, cough] Palin [cough, sneeze] Bachmann [cough].
The fact that Reince Preibus is doing everything they can to convince republicans that they're exactly right about everything, it's just their tone that's off, is certainly good fodder. But it's hard to beat Michelle Bachmann trying to outrun a reporter – "Must... keep... running. Facts catching up to me," – or Sarah Palin's nonsensical, folksy critiques.
Jon Stewart may have hit the nail on the head when they explained, "I think I finally figured out where Sarah Palin came from. Someone cast a spell on a YouTube comment and it came to life."
Southend's players collapse in relief after Michael Timlin's late goal ensured the Shrimpers will go to Wembley
Southend reached the League Two play-off final against Wycombe as extra-time goals from Stephen McLaughlin and Michael Timlin settled a dramatic tie.
Stevenage's Tom Pett put the visitors ahead from close range in the second half, before Ryan Leonard's powerful equaliser made it 2-2 on aggregate.
United striker Barry Corr missed a stoppage-time penalty to win the game at the end of normal time.
But McLaughlin's and Timlin's goals at Roots Hall sent Southend to Wembley.
With the tie level after a 1-1 draw at the Lamex Stadium on Sunday, the Shrimpers knew a home win would see them reach the play-off final at the third time of asking, after two semi-final defeats in the past four seasons.
The home side created the only real chances in a tense first half, with winger David Worrall forcing a good save out of goalkeeper Chris Day early on and Corr, who equalised for their side in Sunday's first leg, chipping the ball wide from close range.
Southend fans flooded onto the Roots Hall pitch in celebration following the final whistle
A Ben Kennedy strike which hit the side-netting was the closest the visitors came to a goal before the break, but in the second half they came out with renewed vigour and were rewarded with the opening goal.
Dean Parrett, who opened the scoring in the first leg with a stunning curling effort, picked up midfielder Simon Walton's corner on the edge of the box and sent an effort towards goal, which took a big deflection and bounced to Pett, who finished from six yards out.
Southend pushed for an immediate reply and defender Cian Bolger's low shot was brilliantly kept out by Day, who then did even better to save Joe Pigott's drive - but there was nothing they could do about the equaliser.
Substitute McLaughlin's deep cross to the far post found Leonard and the Shrimpers player had enough time and space to fire a shot into the roof of the net and bring Roots Hall to life.
Deep into stoppage time, Leonard, under pressure from Parrett, went down in the box and referee Graham Scott awarded the penalty, only for top scorer Corr to chip the spot-kick onto the top of the bar, ensuring the game went into extra-time.
At that stage, Southend, who missed out on automatic promotion on the final day of the season, may have feared this was not to be their year.
The hosts went closest in the first half of extra-time, with Corr heading wide and then almost redeeming themselves for their missed spot-kick with a powerful low strike that Day somehow managed to deflect past their near post.
But the breakthrough finally came for Southend when full-back John White's measured cross was met by substitute McLaughlin's crisp diving header.
Timlin - who played in a headguard after having 15 stitches in a head wound on Sunday - added a third goal late in the game.
Southend boss Phil Brown:
"For Michael Timlin to get that goal...dear me! It emphasised the commitment that was shown to try to win the game. We never do things easy at this place - it doesn't seem that way anyway.
"I have made some big decisions in my life football-wise and that's probably the biggest, Michael Timlin to play.
"On Sunday they went in for that horrific challenge and their captain's laid out. In the 90th minute here they went into another header with a skullcap on - it was just the bravest performance I've seen from an individual in my managerial time."
Stevenage boss Graham Westley:
"They'll take so much confidence from this and there's a real chance in that dressing room that they can have a good season next year.
"We will see where things go from here. I am the Stevenage manager up until the end of May.
"There's been no offer to me. The club is having a serious re-think about what it's going to do for the future so we'll see how that pans out."

A torn meniscus. It did not disable but it impaired, and unpredictably. My stomach learned quickly to tighten at the sound of A's peculiar whimper in response to a crippling pain that would shoot through them at seemingly innocuous movements of the afflicted leg. We have health insurance of sorts, the type that will help you keep your home if tragedy strikes, but that does not shield you from the brunt of what most of day-to-day health care cost is about. We're well practiced in deferring and foregoing care. Here however, we reluctantly acknowledged that a hospital would need to be visited and a doctor consulted.
Tests and a physical examination made clear that an operation was unavoidable. The doctor was a thoughtful man who conscientiously went through what the operation would entail. Surgery would take half a day, then back home by afternoon, convalescence over the following few weeks, with complete recovery the usual outcome. While not painless, the procedure seemed reassuringly routine. Their tone was caring and their outlook about our case optimistic.
The admirable candor with which medical personnel have learned to speak about difficult topics concerning our bodies and our care did not extend to the costs involved. The question of what the procedure would cost, gently broached, initially baffled the staff, eliciting answer-deflecting counter-questions about the adequacy of our insurance coverage, but resulted in no quotes or estimates.
With my insistence on the point, an assistant promised that a figure could be determined, if we needed it, once the surgery was scheduled. “But not before?” I was now the baffled one. A person who linked dollar amounts to medical procedures was eventually found and I was seated at their desk. They required a billing code however, and without a scheduled surgery there was none to offer. As we danced around that issue, my concern over the cost of repairing A's knee was replaced by another curiosity: “Is what I'm asking not routine?” It was not. A billing code was finally lifted from the paperwork of a previous operation, and after some minutes a dollar number was produced. It was a sizable figure, but less than what I'd been led to believe such things cost, at least in the United States. I suspected something still was not clear. “This is then what I'll pay, roughly, to have the procedure done?” I asked in a half questioning, half confirming tone. “No, that's just our part of it, the hospital has their charges, of course.” “But we're in the hospital and I'm asking you for an estimate of what this operation will cost.” They explained, with some frustration, that the operation itself was only a fraction of the pie; they had no way of knowing what the hospital might charge. This was not actually true – they were far better situated than I to know what the hospital charges would be. It was if I had asked for the price of a new car on a showroom floor and had been told by the car salesperson that only the engine could be quoted – other components' prices would need to be discovered separately, by me. In the real world, the total price for most services and products are conveyed to the consumer by the seller or provider at the end of a long chain of added values. In this case, the multiple components of the medical care provided a shield to simultaneously obscure the cost and justify its lack of availability. The billing person scribbled down a number for me to call, then asked if there was any other matter where they could be of assistance.
Hoping for a face-to-face conversation, I asked at the hospital information desk for directions to the office matching the telephone number scribbled on the scrap of paper. “That's not in the hospital”, the information desk attendant declared, “but the call is toll-free”. We went home. For some reason, the inability to locate a price anywhere on the hospital premises for an operation that would take place there shook us as much as would have an encounter with a manifestly incompetent doctor. Though A and I talked only briefly of the cost, or rather the opaqueness of it, we were both invaded with a foreboding that a thing so untethered to its own cost would be in some unspoken way unreliable, dangerous. That night, A announced that they wanted to do the procedure overseas . . . anywhere but here.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the Republican push on health care (all times local):
9:35 p.m.
The nation's doctors, hospitals and health insurance plans are unified in their opposition to the latest Republican bill to dismantle Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
In a joint statement on Saturday, major groups such as the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America's Health Insurance Plans and the BlueCross BlueShield Association called on the Senate to reject the bill sponsored by GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy.
The groups say, "Health care is too important to get wrong."
They warn that under the bill patients and consumers will lose important protections and those with significant illnesses will be charged higher premiums and may not be able to buy coverage.
They also say the cuts to Medicaid would cause millions of Americans to lose their coverage — and the changes would weaken individual insurance markets, making coverage more costly.

3:05 p.m.
Sen. Bill Cassidy will defend the Republican "Obamacare" repeal bill before a Senate panel on Monday. The Senate Finance Committee hearing is being held even though the measure's prospects are dim.
The Louisiana Republican sponsored the legislation with South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham.
Republican Sen. John McCain said Friday he'll oppose the bill in a Senate showdown this week. That means there will almost certainly be enough GOP opposition to sink it.
Sen. Rick Santorum, a former GOP presidential contender, will also appear. They helped round up support for the proposal.
Democratic witnesses will include Cindy Mann, a former Obama administration health official.
The GOP bill would abolish much of President Barack Obama's 2010 health care overhaul and shift money and decision-making to the states.

8:35 a.m.
President Donald Trump is holding out hope that a last-ditch effort to overhaul the Obama-era health law isn't over.
He's taken to Twitter to try to sway GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — who's said he'll oppose the latest Republican bill because it doesn't abolish enough of the Affordable Care Act.
Here's what Trump's tweeted about Paul: "I think they may find a way to get there for the good of the Party!"
Trump's comments come a day after Sen. John McCain announced they wouldn't back the proposal. And their "no" vote has meant a likely death blow to the bill.
McCain also was the critical "no" vote against a previous attempt to overhaul the law in July.
Trump also is lashing out at Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, saying that people in their state are "angry" about the current health law. Murkowski hasn't committed on the bill.

President Donald Trump is attacking Sen. John McCain over the Arizona Republican's opposition to the latest effort to overhaul the nation's health law.
Trump tweets: "John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which their Governor loves. They campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!"
McCain says they can't support a last-ditch push to overhaul the Obama-era health law.
The latest legislation is being co-sponsored by McCain's close friend, Sen. Lindsay Graham.
Trump says the bill would be "great for Arizona" and they say McCain "let their best friend L.G. down!"
___
12:30 a.m.
President Donald Trump is calling Sen. John McCain's opposition to the latest GOP effort to pass a health care bill "sad" and "a horrible, horrible thing for the Republican Party."
McCain says they aren't voting in favor of the bill sponsored by Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.
Graham is McCain's best friend in the Senate, but McCain says they can't support the bill in good conscience.
McCain says they believe lawmakers could do better if Republicans and Democrats work together on a replacement for President Barack Obama's health care law.
Their opposition may well kill the Graham-Cassidy bill.
With McCain and Sen. Rand Paul against it, Republicans can't afford any other defections from their ranks.

A week after Apple announced that the latest version of its Safari browser loads some websites 80 percent faster than Google Chrome, Mozilla is making some lofty claims about its own Firefox browser.
A new version of Firefox available for download on Wednesday separates the browser into multiple separate computing processes, so that a rogue website that attempts to use up a lot of your computer's processing power won't drag down the websites in any other tabs you might have open at the same time.
Using multiple processes to handle demanding websites is nothing new: Chrome, Safari, and other browsers have already implemented the capability. Mozilla's delay, according to Firefox Senior Product Manager Ryan Polluck, was related to ensuring compatibility for browser add-ons.
"While Mozilla's engineers knew that this new multi-process approach was possible, adapting Firefox to run in multiple processes would require breaking Firefox Add-Ons that depended on a single-process architecture," they wrote in a Medium post. "Mozilla was reluctant to do this because customizing Firefox through Add-Ons has always been very popular."
A switch from Firefox's proprietary add-on platform to cross-browser WebExtensions solved this issue, Polluck said.
Switching to multiple processes will not only improve performance for users who often open multiple tabs at once, but also for owners of budget PCs with little memory that may have trouble displaying even a single modern website. In fact, Mozilla claims that with the update, Firefox now uses less memory than Safari, Microsoft Edge, and the Windows, Mac, and Linux versions of Chrome.
On the other end of the spectrum, Firefox will now let PC users with lots of memory to spare customize the number of processes the browser uses, Polluck said. If your system has more than 8GB of RAM, you can enter "about:config" in your address bar to increase processes by adjusting the number for the "dom.ipc.processCount" setting.
A GROUP of southern Tasmanian high school students have undergone tests for possible blood-borne viruses after a teacher decided to take blood tests from a class.
Eighteen Grade 9 and 10 students were attempting to test the PH levels of their blood in the class experiment, The Mercury reports.
The science teacher made an attempt to sterilise the needle with methylated spirits between tests.
Dr Roscoe Taylor, Director of Public Health said methylated spirits would not prevent the transmission of HIV or Hepatitis B or C.
"The risk of transmission is extremely low in this age group, but it is always a risk to share needles," they said.
"This is an incident that should not have happened."
Education Minister Lin Thorp said the full cost of testing the children for viruses will be covered by the Education Department.
"While the risks of the students getting infected with a blood-borne virus is considered to be minimal, it is important that all students who took part in the testing undergo blood tests," Ms Thorp said.
Ms Thorp has also demanded a full investigation into how the testing was allowed to take place in the first place and why it too so long for the department to be advised.
Ms Thorp has not ruled out any disciplinary action against the teacher involved.

PoliZette Sessions Smear Showcases Dems' Neo-McCarthyism Liberals put partisanship above patriotism in drive to tie Trump allies to Putin
Attorney General Jeff Sessions gave an insufficiently nuanced answer during their Senate hearing and it has Democrats demanding they resign. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — in their biggest emotional overreaction since they cried about President Donald Trump's travel ban executive order — said “I felt a knot in the pit of my stomach.”
At the risk of causing stomach-pretzeling, here's the exchange between Sessions and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.):
After eight years of treating the president with white gloves, the media appears to be making up for lost time.

Franken: “If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?”
Sessions: “Sen. Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have — did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.”
Is it just me, or have the Democrats wildly adjusted their threshold for calling something perjury? Seriously, are these the same people who defended Hillary Clinton when they told the Select Committee on Benghazi that “nothing was marked classified at the time I sent or received it”? That blatant falsehood was blown out of the water by the director of the FBI and Democrats couldn't wait to defend it.
[lz_ndn video=31888176]
Yet Sessions' lack of nuance causes gastrointestinal trauma? It's clear that Sessions meant in their role as a “surrogate” for the campaign. They didn't mean that he's never spoken to any Russians before in any capacity or for any reason. According to their spokesperson, Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessions conversed with over 25 foreign ambassadors in their capacity as a senior member of the Armed Service committee.

Is it possible that the Democrats are just making partisan noise? The news-cycle-changing timing of these new revelations is certainly suspect. Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress was so outstanding that the mainstream media was forced give it positive coverage.
Finally, Trump got a positive news cycle. Americans — regardless of party — were pumped up for a job-creating, America First agenda. They were excited to see that — despite mainstream media characterizations — Trump isn't a mustache-twisting villain intent on tying America to the train tracks. It was the most unifying message Americans have heard from a president in years.
But, alas, we can't spend any time discussing the agenda they laid out because we have to keep Russia in the news.
This is just the latest in the Democrats' McCarthy-esque game of pointing their finger and declaring people members of the amorphous Russian conspiracy. And the game all rides on the mainstream media who have been force-feeding the “Trump Loves Russia” narrative to Americans, no matter how sparse the evidence to back it up.
What's worrisome is not that Sessions has some sinister plan to make secret deals with Russia — nobody with a brain thinks that. What's worrisome is the party-first-country-second partisanship on the Democratic side of the aisle. Maybe the Trump administration should do as Clinton would and find a YouTube video hardly anyone has ever seen and offer it up to the mainstream media as a scapegoat.

After eight years of treating the president with white gloves, the media appears to be making up for lost time. Where was the outrage from jabbering head pundits when Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for withholding information on Fast and Furious? Where were they when National Security Adviser Susan Rice was peddling Benghazi lies on all the Sunday shows? Where were they when the IRS was illegally targeting conservative groups and evidence kept disappearing? Where were they when ransom planes filled with cash landed in Tehran? Where were they when the Justice Department went after Fox News reporter James Rosen? Where were they when Secret Service agents in Cartagena were making sure they had “Plenty of Magnums” and “Cash for dem hoes?”
There's a McCarthy-era political cartoon that shows senators forcing an elephant to stand on a precarious stack of tar buckets labeled “McCarthyism.” The terrified elephant exclaims, “You mean I'm supposed to stand on that?” Replace the elephant with a donkey, and it's perfect for today.
Democrats are calling for special prosecutors without any evidence of crime. They're calling for the attorney general of the United States to resign over semantics. Worst of all, they — along with their mainstream media allies — are trying to smear good people as evil conspirators without facts to back it up.

A highway maintenance company being sued by ICBC over potholes on the Coquihalla is fighting back.
The insurer is trying to recoup nearly $40,000 paid in claims to 19 drivers who hit a pothole on the Coquihalla in February 2011.
In a notice of civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court earlier this year, ICBC alleged VSA Highway Maintenance failed in its duty to drivers, was aware of the road's deterioration, and did nothing to warn the public.
In its response to civil claim, VSA says it fully complied with the agreement it had with the province.
The company says if any damage was done it's because drivers failed to keep a proper lookout, drove too fast and failed to take adequate — if any — steps to avoid what it calls "the alleged" pothole.
Neither party has commented publicly on the suit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama could use frozen Libyan government assets to pay for humanitarian aid to Libyan people caught in the North African country's civil war under a bill sponsored by a group of leading Senate Democrats and Republicans.
“The ongoing violence in Libya has disrupted the economy and left far too many innocent Libyan citizens struggling to simply put food on the table and to manage the daily necessities of life,” Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson said on Wednesday in a joint statement with the committee's senior Republican, Richard Shelby.
The United States is holding more than $34 billion as part of sanctions imposed in late February against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and their top officials.
Under the measure, none of the assets could be used to buy weapons or military equipment. Some U.S. lawmakers have been wary of directly arming Libyan rebels seeking to overthrow Gaddafi.
Obama administration officials have said they were looking into whether some of the frozen cash, securities and other financial instruments could be used to aid the Libyan rebel effort.
Other backers of the bill are Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and the panel's top Republican John McCain, and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman, an Independent.
Bipartisan agreement on the measure written in consultation with the administration gives it a better chance of quick passage. But the measure would still have to clear the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sponsors of bill said the war in Libya has nearly brought its economy to a halt and has precipitated a humanitarian crisis with food and medical supplies running dangerously low in some areas.
Rebel groups and forces loyal to the Libyan leader have been fighting in a civil war ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies.

The United States Senate is an undemocratic institution. Just do the math: Progressive California Senator Kamala Harris was elected in 2016 with 7,542,753 votes. Yet their vote on issues such as health-care reform counts for no more than that of conservative Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi, who was elected in 2014 with 121,554 votes. Ad Policy
This is an absurd imbalance. In fact, the only thing that would make it more absurd would be if voters were removed from the equation altogether.
Say “hello” to the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, the corporate-funded project to impose a top-down right-wing agenda on the states. ALEC is considering whether to adopt a new piece of “model legislation” that proposes to do away with an elected Senate.
The idea of reversing 104 years of representative democracy and returning to the bad old days when senators were chosen via backroom deals between wealthy campaign donors, corporate lobbyists, and crooked legislators, is not new. The John Birch Society peddled the proposal decades ago. But with the rise of the “Tea Party” movement, the notion moved into the conservative mainstream.
Then–Texas Governor Rick Perry argued in 2012 that the direct election of senators “took the states out of the process.” Several Republican senators apparently agree, with Utah Senator Mike Lee referring to the 17th Amendment as “a mistake” and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake saying, “I think it's better as it reinforces the notion of federalism to have senators appointed by state legislatures.” What was once a fringe fantasy is being taken ever more seriously by conservative strategists.
Last year, ALEC published an article by a so-called “subject-matter expert” arguing that the popular election of senators is “disenfranchising the States.” The article made an old-school states' rights argument for taking the power to choose senators away from the people and giving it to the politicians who sit in state legislatures.
ALEC has yet to formally embrace the theory, but last month it circulated a “draft resolution recommending constitutional amendment restoring election of u.s. senators to the legislatures of the sovereign states.” That resolution is among the items expected to be considered at this week's annual meeting of the influential group. Current Issue View our current issue
The resolution gets right to the point:
Section 1. The seventeenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. Section 2. Senators shall be elected exclusively by the State legislature, upon a majority vote of legislators present and voting in a joint session. If a vacancy shall exist for more than one hundred-eighty days, then the Governor shall appoint the Senator to serve the remainder of the vacant term. This procedure may not be modified by state initiative or referendum. Section 3. State legislatures may issue instructions to, or recall, their Senators at any time.
If this project is approved by ALEC members, the resolution will become part of ALEC's agenda for the states—advanced by conservative legislators who have established a pattern of rubber-stamping ALEC's “model legislation.” If successful, they will reverse one of the great strides toward democracy in American history: the 1913 decision to end the corrupt practice of letting state legislators barter off Senate seats in backroom deals with campaign donors and lobbyists.
Make no mistake: Doing away with the direct election of senators would make Congress less representative and more likely to bend to corporate pressure on issues ranging from health care to wages to Social Security. The Senate would also, in all likelihood, become more socially conservative on issues such as abortion rights, gay rights, and the separation of church and state.
How so? Republicans currently hold 52 US Senate seats. Democrats hold 46, while two independents (Vermont's Bernie Sanders and Maine's Angus King) caucus with the minority. That 52-48 divide does not accurately reflect the sentiments of great mass of Americans. In 2016, for instance, 51,496,682 Americans cast ballots for Democratic Senate candidates (including a pair of Democrats running in California) while 40,402,790 cast Republican ballots, yet the Republicans took 22 seats to 12 for the Democrats.
If state legislatures were to begin naming senators, the imbalance in the upper chamber would almost certainly grow. Republicans currently control 32 state legislatures (including the titularly nonpartisan single chamber in Nebraska) and Democrat have clear control in 12 states. In six other states, power is divided between the parties—although the divisions are complicated and potentially in flux because of shifting coalitions and special elections to fill vacancies.
Let's focus on the 32 legislatures where Republicans have control: If Republicans were to maintain their current advantage, and if they were empowered to replace all sitting Democratic senators at the end of their current terms, they could shape a Senate with at least 64 Republican members. Democrats who currently represent traditional swing states, such as Michigan's Debbie Stabenow, Missouri's Claire McCaskill, New Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, and Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin are just some of the roughly 20 Democrats who would be vulnerable to replacement not by the voters but by the politicians. A handful of Republican, such as Nevada's Dean Heller, might also be vulnerable. But that prospect of a 64-36 split is the Senate is genuine, and it is hardly unreasonable to suggest the possibility of a 67-33 split that would allow for one-party approval of a constitutional amendment.
That's just a rough measure of the changes that could occur. Legislatures controlled by right-wing Republicans could reject relatively moderate Republicans. Legislatures controlled by Republicans or Democrats could reject independents such as Sanders and King. And campaign contributors such as the Koch brothers and their network of right-wing billionaires, which already has tremendous influence in statehouses, could actually get more senators who are to their liking.
Overturning the 17th Amendment would not be easy. For one thing, there is no evidence that Americans favor the change. But as Republican legislators move closer to the numbers they need to demand a “convention of the states” to enact a “Balanced Budget Amendment” that would constrain the federal government by effectively dictating budgeting priorities, it is wise to be wary of those who seek to constrain democracy itself.

Carlton J. Chin, a fund manager, and Jay P. Granat, a psychotherapist, wrote “Who Will Win the Big Game? A Psychological and Mathematical Method.”
Today is the 30th anniversary of “The Miracle on Ice,” the stunning victory of the United States men's hockey team over the Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. The young American team of amateurs went on to win the gold medal against Finland two days later.
But how big an upset was it? Using quantitative methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we studied the magnitude of the 1980 victory. Sport psychology played a big role in the Americans winning the gold medal and helped bridged the gap from 1,000-to-1 odds, down to a more manageable level of a 17-1 long-shot.
The Soviet Union was the heavy favorite to repeat as gold medal champions in 1980, while the United States was seeded seventh out of 12 teams. We calculated the odds of the U.S.S.R. winning the gold medal at about 77 percent. The Soviets had won four consecutive Olympic ice hockey gold medals since the United States claimed the 1960 gold medal. The Soviets had not lost a game at the Olympics since 1968. They often beat the strongest competitors by five or more goals and regularly ran up double-digit winning margins. Just a few days before the 1980 Olympics started, the Soviets demolished the United States in an exhibition game, 10-3.
Based on key hockey statistics and expectations, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to study the odds of the United States hockey team winning the gold medal. Monte Carlo methods use a random process to solve complicated problems. For example, Monte Carlo analysis can be used to find the area of an irregularly-shaped object. By placing the object inside a rectangle and then throwing darts at the rectangle, the area of the odd shape can be computed by taking the area of the rectangle and multiplying it by the percentage of darts falling within the rectangle.
In a similar manner, hockey games can be modeled based on certain random variables and key statistics, including shots on goal, save percentage and shot efficiency. If we model the United States team as a seventh seed, the probability of the United States winning the gold medal approaches odds as high as 1 in 1,000.
But the United States turned out to be a stronger team than expected. Entering the medal round of the Olympics, the United States and Soviet teams were undefeated. The United States was 4-0-1, outscoring their opponents by 25-10, while the Russians were 5-0, outscoring their opponents by 51-11. The Soviet goaltenders, Vladislav Tretiak and Vladimir Myshkin, averaged a solid 88.2 save percentage, and the American goalie Jim Craig had a 91.7 save percentage.
If we base our simulations on the team's performance in the tournament, the odds could have been as low as 17-to-1 for the United States win the gold medal.
Principles of sport psychology are often called intangibles and are hard to measure, but Coach Herb Brooks's methods certainly increased their team's gold-medal chances. After analyzing the championship games or series of the N.F.L., N.B.A., Major League Baseball and N.H.L., and the major finals in golf and tennis, we identified 50 championships characteristics in our book, “Who Will Win the Big Game? A Psychological and Mathematical Method.” Though we did not analyze Olympic hockey finals, some key factors to success across sports were present in the American team:
Leadership on defensive side. As stated above, Craig had a better save percentage than the Russian goalies, and the United States ended up giving the fewest goals over all (15) in the tournament. In the Stanley Cup finals, the teams with better defensive leadership, in terms of goalie, won the championship 62.2 percent of the time.
Home-field advantage. This is consistent across every sport. This home vs. away impact even shows up on individual statistics. In baseball, players have batting averages about 10 points higher at home than on the road. For the Olympics, the effect can potentially be magnified.
Coaching. Great coaches are great psychologists. They have the capacity to inspire their players, build team chemistry and they can empower underdogs to beat teams that appear to be more powerful. Brooks used just about every trick in the sport psychology book.
They graduated from college with a degree in psychology, and was a successful college coach at University of Minnesota, winning three championships in four finals appearances. Brooks gave each prospect a psychology test to help them select a certain type of player. They wanted players who were open-minded, easily coached and willing to learn a new style of play.
They consciously addressed many of the key concepts of sport psychology to improve their team's chances of succeeding at the Olympics. One such factor is team chemistry. Nine of the American players played for Brooks at Minnesota. Several others were from the Boston University. This helped team chemistry instantly.
On the other hand, Brooks knew that the rivalry between the University of Minnesota and Boston University could cause problems, so they organized forward lines by region, which helped to build team chemistry and camaraderie. In addition, Brooks, always a disciplinarian, made a conscious decision to be tough. They thought that if the players hated them more than they hated each other, they could become a cohesive unit.
Brooks's philosophy can be summarized by their statement: “The common denominator of all the guys … was that they were really competitive, very hungry, very focused, and mentally tough — to go along with whatever talent they had.” While the team was talented, Brooks preferred to tell the world that they were underdogs.
The element of surprise. On the Soviet side, sports psychology also showed its effects. The Soviet team was so used to blowing out other teams, that when the game stayed closer than expected, they may have reacted differently. Many players, including the Soviet coach himself, said that the biggest mistake was pulling Tretiak in the second period with the score tied, 2-2.
Thus, the Miracle might have been a bit less miraculous than most people think.
Key West Awash With Plans For Rising Sea Level
Enlarge this image toggle caption Lynne Sladky/AP Lynne Sladky/AP
Florida — especially South Florida — is very flat and very low, and in places like Miami Beach and Key West, buildings are just 3 feet above sea level. Scientists now say there may be a 3-foot rise in the world's oceans by the end of the century.
Under ordinances recently adopted in Key West, all new buildings will have to be raised at least a foot and a half higher than the old standard, use green building codes, and have large, freshwater cisterns. The water will be used in gardens, swimming pools and toilets. By collecting rainwater, cisterns help reduce flooding by keeping it out of the streets.
"We are connected to the mainland by a thin thread of U.S. 1 and a pipeline that travels 154 miles to South Florida for our water," says Donald Craig, the city's planning director. "We are, in all senses of the word, vulnerable to sea level rise."
Making Adjustments
Planning For The Future Policymakers in Florida and around the country are starting to look at how they can best adapt to the threat of rising sea levels. Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York has proposed a $20 billion plan to protect the city from increased storm surge and flooding that we'll see from climate change. There will be infrastructure challenges, such as improving drainage, using pumps, raising roadways and buildings. And there will also be legal and political questions. How does a city decide which neighborhoods can be protected against sea level rise and which will have to be abandoned? Also, what happens to property along the coast after it's inundated? Will the owner retain rights to rebuild? Can the land be mined for use as fill to elevate other areas along the shore? In Key West, those who are planning for sea level rise say it's unlikely important historic and cultural areas will be abandoned. They point to Venice, Italy, as a likely model. Regular tidal flooding there has become a way of life for residents and visitors. It's a place where it's not unusual to see people wearing rubber boots, sitting in cafes where water laps around their feet.
Key West is in Monroe County. Three years ago, Monroe joined three other counties in South Florida to plan for the impact of climate change. Projections developed for the group say South Florida may see between a 3- and 7-inch sea level rise by 2020. By the year 2060, the counties are planning for a sea level rise of up to 2 feet.
Craig says exact numbers are hard to pin down. "We don't know whether that's going to be all at once, whether it's going to be 2 inches a year, but the reality is that sea level is going to rise. We have to plan for it, and this is one of the ways that we can do that," they say.
Key West's downtown tourist epicenter is also one of the island's lowest points. Alison Higgins, Key West's sustainability coordinator, is one of the people planning how the island will change to adapt to rising sea level.
It's not just a question for the future. Higgins says the town deals with it every month — during the full moon when the high tide pushes seawater up through the storm drains, flooding some streets. Rainwater recently lapped over the curb at a downtown CVS and flooded all the merchandise on the bottom floor.
Outside its front entrance, the drugstore now keeps a permanent stack of sandbags at the ready. To help stop the regular flooding, Key West is spending more than $4 million to install pumps and upgrade its drainage downtown.
But in other parts of town, Higgins says there's not an easy solution. In midtown, they say, there are some wood structures and a lot built from concrete block. "It was the cheaper way to build," they say.
It's one of the lowest-lying neighborhoods in Key West, just a few feet above sea level. It flooded during Hurricane Wilma in 2005, and, as the oceans rise, it will become more vulnerable to flooding from storm surge and even rainstorms. Because most houses are concrete block built on slabs, they're not easily elevated.
New federal flood insurance rates recently took effect have dramatically raised the premiums for many who live here. Chris Bergh with the Nature Conservancy says increasing the cost of living in paradise is one more impact of sea level rise.
We don't know whether that's going to be all at once, whether it's going to be two inches a year, but the reality is that sea level is going to rise.
"Part of the reason that property values are so high here is that it's been considered a desirable place to live. But, at some point with sea level rise, the risks associated with living near the ocean start to come into play and start to counteract those benefits," Bergh says.
Others in Key West though are more optimistic. Even under worst-case scenarios of a 3-foot rise by the end of the century, they say Key West will survive and even prosper.
"People will want to continue to live near the water," Craig says.
Craig says in Key West and other coastal areas, they think people and the communities they live in will adapt.
"They will recognize that they have to raise their houses. We will have to make adjustments in our roads," they say. "When you think about it, if the Dutch can adapt by having a series of barriers against the North Sea that they maintain at great expense, then we can adapt."
Key West also has something else in its favor. For nearly 200 years now, the U.S. Navy has had a major presence here. And rising seas or not, that's not expected to change.
The B.C. Teachers' Federation has told its members it will serve notice of a full-scale strike beginning next Tuesday, one day after 86 per cent voted in favour of escalating their job action.
In a letter to its members, the union confirmed it will serve notice of strike action likely starting on June 17 and also designated Monday a study session day throughout the province.
This would mean teachers would spend Monday meeting with union representatives all day — making this Friday the last day of the school year.
For schools where ongoing rotating strike action is taking place this Friday, the last day of school would be even earlier than elsewhere — landing this Thursday.
"We believe that the combined actions of bargaining hard and the solidarity of standing together are the key ingredients needed to get a deal that works for teachers and for our students before June 30 and hopefully sooner," said the letter.
"Please know that both parties are currently involved in discussions," the letter continued. "Our intention is to bargain non-stop throughout the weekend.
"We believe that a small, but important window to negotiate a fair deal exists and we want to take every opportunity to get that deal."
However, the letter says, the situation is fluid and members should take personal items they will need during the summer home with them this week.
Teachers vote to strike
Some 28,809 teachers voted in favour of a full-scale walkout, of a total of 33,387 who cast ballots in a vote held over Monday and Tuesday this week.
Speaking Tuesday night, BCTF president Jim Iker ​had stressed that while teachers were prepared to fully withdraw services, that decision had not yet been made.
"We want a deal definitely by the end of June and we want a deal earlier than that," said Iker on Tuesday.
"If we get that deal, there will be no more job action, there will be no more lockouts and we can go into the summer knowing we've got some certainty for September for our students and for our teachers,"
The union is required to give three days' notice before members walk off the job, making the earliest possible date for school closures across B.C. Tuesday, June 17.
Speaking on Tuesday, Iker had said the full-scale strike could still be averted if a deal with the government could be negotiated.
"B.C. teachers have shown incredible strength and commitment during the rotating strikes and the government's chaotic lockout," said Iker.
"More than ever, parents understand that this fight is about quality education for students and fairness for teachers."
'Let's stay at the table'
Speaking on Tuesday, B.C. Education Minister Peter Fassbender said they aren't surprised by the vote results.
"We have had and felt the pressure to get a settlement since last June, I feel no more pressure tonight after this vote than I did yesterday," Fassbender told the CBC.
The minister also issued a statement reacting to news of the vote.
"While the BCTF leadership received the mandate they sought, no one should interpret this as any kind of enthusiasm on the part of teachers to shut down schools," said the statement.

"I know teachers would prefer to be in their classrooms and I know that students and parents would rather finish this school year on a positive note. It is now up to the BCTF leadership to decide if they are going to move to a full walkout."
Fassbender said the union needs to rethink its expectations and be more willing to engage in meaningful bargaining.
"My message to the BCTF is: let's stay at the table and get to an agreement by June 30, so we can head into the summer with the assurance that our education system is on a path to long-term stability and focused on student outcomes."
Teachers have been without a contract since June 2013, and the vote is the latest development in the dispute that has seen the union and government divided over issues of wages and classroom conditions.
The government has saved $12 million each week in salaries during the teachers' current but limited job action, plus nearly $5 million more by chopping wages.
In the event of a full strike affecting the end of the school year, the B.C. government says every effort will be made to ensure report cards and exams aren't affected.
Potential strike impacts
What the full strike would mean for students in kindergarten up to Grade 9:
Schools would be closed.
Parents should make child care arrangements, where required.
Final report cards will be sent to parents, but written comments may be shorter than usual.
​What the full strike would mean for students in Grades 10, 11 and 12:
Secondary schools would likely only be open for the purpose of administering exams.
Picket lines could be present outside schools.
Students in rural areas may not have normal school bus service.
Provincial exams will be marked and final marks will be sent out in as timely a manner as possible.
The Ministry of Education says the BCPSEA has asked the Labour Relations Board to deem the work required for the completion of report cards as an essential service.

No Cabinet officer has been impeached by the House since 1876. GOP to call for Holder impeachment
A group of hard-line conservative House Republicans will introduce a resolution on Thursday calling for the impeachment of Attorney General Eric Holder.
But there is no sign yet that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) or other House GOP leaders will act on the measure.
Story Continued Below
Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas) and 10 other House Republicans — including Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho — have drafted four articles of impeachment against Holder. These include allegations that Holder violated federal law by refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena over the botched Fast and Furious gun-walking program; “failed to enforce multiple laws, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,”; did not prosecute IRS employees over allegations the agency improperly handled the applications for nonprofit status by conservative political groups; and misled Congress over whether they were aware of a search warrant issued for the emails of FOX News reporter James Rosen.
“This was not a decision that I made lightly,” Olson said in a statement. “Since the House voted in 2012 to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt, the pattern of disregard for the rule of law and refusal to be forthright has only continued. The American people deserve answers and accountability. If the Attorney General refuses to provide answers, then Congress must take action.”
( QUIZ: How well do you know Eric Holder?)
Boehner's office declined to comment on the Olson impeachment resolution, referring calls to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). Goodlatte's panel would conduct any impeachment hearings against Holder.
In their own statement, Goodlatte was noncommittal on whether they planned to move forward with the resolution, although they did say that Holder should resign for the good of the Justice Department.
“Under Attorney General Holder's watch, there has been a lack of leadership and a politicization of the Justice Department. Scandals from the Fast and Furious gunwalking operation to the seizure of reporters' emails and phone records in national security leaks investigations have undermined the Department's credibility and the American people's trust. Attorney General Holder has also politicized the rule of law by refusing to enforce laws they don't like.”
Goodlatte added: “The only way to restore credibility at the Department of Justice is through an improvement in the quality of leadership. President Obama should make a change in the leadership of the Department of Justice to restore the confidence of the American people in our nation's top law enforcement agency.”

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the impeachment resolution.
But Matthew Miller, a former top Holder aide as DOJ, dismissed it as laughable.
“The first thing I'd say is that I can't believe they didn't include Benghazi and the Black Panthers because this is a list of every other Republican bugaboo and conspiracy theory,” said Miller, now a communications consultant on K Street.
“The best thing that could happen to Democrats would be for Republicans to bring this up. The more time they spend on this, the crazier and more out of touch they would look.”
The House approved civil and contempt resolutions against Holder in June 2012 over the Fast and Furious program, the first time that has been done to a sitting Cabinet member. DOJ refused to enforce the criminal contempt resolution, as previous administrations have done. The civil contempt citation is mired in a legal fight in federal court between Justice and House attorneys.
No Cabinet officer has been impeached by the House since Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached in March 1876 , despite the fact that the resigned minutes before the House vote. The Senate held a trial for Belknap, acquitting them on all five charges. Belknap was never criminally prosecuted over the allegations.
Last year at Astana, Mikel Landa's third place overall in the Giro d'Italia and two mountain stage wins represented a massive breakthrough for the Basque professional. This year, Landa, 26, will head Team Sky's bid to win the Giro d'Italia in their first ever Grand Tour as team leader. They talked to Cyclingnews about the biggest challenge of their career to date.

Landa on cusp of Giro del Trentino victory
Landa wins Giro del Trentino
Cyclingnews: With the Giro d'Italia just around the corner, how are you feeling?
Mikel Landa: In very good shape and very motivated. After winning the Giro del Trentino, my morale is very high and I'm ready to go for it.
CN: Compared with 2015, when you showed strongly in Trentino and took second overall, but didn't win a stage, have you therefore moved up a level?
ML: I think I'm pretty much on the same level, to be honest. But I'm more experienced as a racer and that's why I could win Trentino.
CN: You said during Trentino that you'd expected more of a fight with Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) during that race...
ML: Yes, I said that. I don't know if he's still not at 100 percent or if they were deliberately concealing their real condition. But I thought they were going to put up more of a fight. Either way, he's a favourite for the Giro d'Italia.
CN: And what about [Alejandro] Valverde (Movistar)? Have you raced much against them in a GC battle?
ML: Not directly, partly because I've rarely raced as a team leader up to now and so I've not often had that responsibility. But I've been in races with them and we all know what kind of rider they are.
CN: The first week of the Giro has got a start in Holland with flat stages then a long transfer down to southern Italy, followed by some tough, tricky stages in the Apennines and finishing off with a time trial. Is it fair to say it's hardly a straightforward opening first week for you?
ML: It's better when the Giro starts off directly in Italy and we don't have to deal with that kind of terrain that's so different to Italy. But at the same time, there are all sorts of different interests at stake here and you have to respect that.
CN: One of the big question marks this year will be how your time trialling has progressed. [Landa lost four minutes to Alberto Contador in the 2015 time trial at Valdobbiadene last year - ed.]
ML: We've been working on it a lot, the aerodynamics and so on and I've been riding on the TT bike a lot over the winter. I hope there will be an improvement in the Giro d'Italia. The team has helped me a lot to adapt to my new environment and has been very supportive.
CN: You've never ridden the Tour de France but you've raced the Vuelta four times. How does racing the Giro compare to the Vuelta?
ML: The Giro is much less straightforward. The route always has some unexpected surprises – whether it's an unclassified climb near the end of a stage or a descent that's particularly complicated. You've got to keep your eyes on the ball all the time.
CN: People talk a lot about you as a top contender, and about Nibali and Valverde, but are there other top favourites?
ML: Yes. Tom Dumoulin (Giant-Alpecin). With all these time trials, he's going to be a real threat. Rigoberto Urán (Cannondale) who's been second in the Giro d'Italia twice. Rafa Majka (Tinkoff), who's very experienced in Grand Tour racing… They're all as many favourites as me.
CN: Have you been to recon any stages, and is there any one that you particularly thinks suits you?
ML: I've checked out the two time trial stages in Italy and the Corvara stage as well. Any that have a summit finish are good for me.
CN: Overall, is this year's Giro route better or worse for you than last year?
ML: I think it's worse. There's no really hard mountain stages with a summit finish, which is what I like the most. There's a 10 kilometre opening, flat time trial which doesn't sound so long, but it's still 10 kilometres. Then the 40 kilometre mid-race time trial that's basically flat and which will be a factor against me. But it is what it is and there are some very hard mountain stages, too.
CN: With sprinter Elia Viviani named in Sky's provisional Giro d'Italia line-up, will the team have other objectives as well as the overall with you?
ML: If he's coming, he's there to win stages [like last year's bunch sprint into Genova - Ed.]. They are always important for the team and they're good morale boosters for everybody.
CN: After the Giro, have you talked with the team about maybe riding the Tour or is it 100 percent ruled out?
ML: We haven't discussed beyond the end of the Giro. First of all we want to get through the Giro, see what kind of condition I'm in and then we'll take a decision after that.
Corrupt: The FBI Made ‘Side Deals' With Hillary Clinton To Destroy Evidence
This is one of those “literally WTF?” moments in history.
You're supposed to be able to trust the FBI to get down to the bottom of very serious crimes and now we find out that not only are they not doing everything in their power to get the real answers, but they are making deals with criminals in the interest of covering up their wrong-doings!
So, not only did the Hillary Clinton team lie about their emails, but they hid important evidence, as well as having people within the FBI destroy evidence for them. This according Guy Benson at Townhall.
Trending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet
This leads a thinking individual to ask some fairly serious questions.
WHY did they agree to destroy the laptops?
DID they follow through on the destruction of the devices, thereby making followup investigations nearly impossible?
IS the FBI looking into this (not that we can rely on them to get the truth)?
WILL there be any repercussions for the employee(s) who made this deal?
While many would suggest that the FBI has been corrupt for a long, long time, this is perhaps the most blatant example of government corruption that I can remember. (I'm not that old, so cut me some slack.)
Representative Goodlatte (R – VA) issued a statement about the letter they sent to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, which can be read in its entirety here.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) today pressed Attorney General Loretta Lynch about a secret agreement to destroy the laptops of top advisors to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As part of the House Judiciary Committee's ongoing oversight of Secretary Clinton's unauthorized use of a private email server during their tenure as Secretary of State, the Justice Department provided a private review of certain immunity agreements entered into during the investigation. The immunity agreements mentioned secret side agreements between the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Beth Wilkinson, the lawyer representing Cheryl Mills, chief of staff and counselor to Secretary Clinton, and Heather Samuelson, senior advisor to Secretary Clinton. After reviewing the side agreements, the Committee has learned that the FBI agreed to destroy Mills and Samuelson's laptops after inspecting them. In their letter to Attorney General Lynch, Chairman Goodlatte calls on the Justice Department to provide information about the side agreements and answer the many questions they raise about the FBI's investigation.
It's times like this that you can't do anything but shake your head in profound disappointment.

When people think about rocket ships and space exploration, they often imagine traveling across the Milky Way, landing on mysterious planets and even meeting alien life forms.
In reality, humans' drive to get off Planet Earth has led to tremendous technological advances in our mundane daily lives — ones we use right here at home on terra firma.
I recently walked through Boston's Logan International Airport; a NASA display reminded me that GPS navigation, anti-icing systems, memory foam and LED lights were all originally created for space travel. Other inventions NASA science has created include the pacemaker, scratch-resistant lenses and the solar panel.
These types of advancements are one of the most important reasons I am hoping our next U.S. president will try to jump-start the American space program — both privately and publicly. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear any of them are talking about the issue. But they should be. As we enter the transhumanist age — the era of bionic limbs, brain implants and artificial intelligence — space exploration might once again dramatically lead us forward in discovering the most our species can become.
Already SpaceX, led by CEO Elon Musk, has announced it will be tackling an unmanned trip to Mars in 2018. The hope, of course, is that within the next 10-15 years, astronauts will be stepping foot upon the red planet, too. If indeed, humans can make it to Mars — and I'm sure we will — much new tech would have to be developed for the mission. It's safe to say much of that tech would likely be something useful for us eventually on Earth, as well.
For example, just to even live in space for the journey — it'll take approximately six months to travel one-way to Mars — new ways of sleeping, recycling breathable air and preserving foods and drink would likely have to be developed.
Furthermore, the technology to withstand massive dust storms, freezing temperatures and a hostile environment on Mars would require new space suits and maybe even totally new materials. Innovation like this will benefit everyone — even if we don't know all the uses yet for such radical tech.
Of course, there are other reasons for prompting a renewed and significantly larger space program in America. One of the fundamental goals of my own presidential campaign has been warning the world of the incredible threat of existential risk.
The Atlantic recently ran a story by Robinson Meyer that read:
At life-long scales, one in 120 Americans die in an accident. The risk of human extinction due to climate change — or an accidental nuclear war — is much higher than that. The Stern Review, the U.K. government's premier report on the economics of climate change, estimated a 0.1 percent risk of human extinction every year. That may sound low, but it also adds up when extrapolated to century-scale. Across 100 years, that figure would entail a 9.5 percent chance of human extinction.
I think most people are totally unaware at how high the odds are that we screw up our species' very existence. It's so high, that the newly written Transhumanist Bill of Rights has a mandate for space exploration as one of its key six points.
The facts of existential risk are simple: We may not be able to indefinitely keep the planet habitable, stop a super virus from killing everyone, avoid a mile-wide asteroid from crashing into Earth, elude a warmongering Terminator-like AI or circumvent blowing ourselves up with our 25,000 nuclear warheads — but we sure can get off this planet and create cool new places to live safely in outer space.
Generally, politicians see no upside for sending astronauts to space except national pride.
The movie Elysium recently showed a dystopic but technologically plausible space habitat, where paradise is engineered in the skies — and not on Earth's land or water. Now, no one wants to be forced into this scenario, but massive space habitats are worthwhile projects to pursue — and they could be possible to build in as little as 15 years.
Mega-space habitats would also make an easier launch base for space mining, an industry booming with interest. Experts say it will soon be possible to mine asteroids from space — some that are worth billions of dollars each. Clive Thomson at Wired recently wrote that the asteroid Ryugu — partially made of up of nickel, iron and cobalt — could be worth up to $95 billion.
As a science advocate, I'm strongly pro-space exploration from a private industry point of view. But just as importantly, I also passionately support a U.S. government-sponsored space program — one that gets approximately 10 times the funding it gets now (I'd get that extra money from our military budget, which is ridiculously oversized anyway). That would be nearly $100 billion a year, or about 5 percent of the U.S. 2016 Federal budget.
Generally, my libertarian-minded self doesn't want the government too involved in much of anything, but because space exploration involves defending against existential risk and pursuing medical innovation for citizens, I'd advocate for the U.S. putting dramatically more resources into space exploration. This wouldn't mean entirely relying on federal programs to push forward the space industry, but also on government partnering with or investing in private space companies.
Sadly, Congress will likely put up a fight against spending too much on peacetime space exploration — they do have that habit of being boring and shortsighted. So, perhaps the best way to grow America's space industry is to sell Congress on the amount of benefits our nation might gain from a meaningful and dramatically enlarged space program. Generally, politicians — those directly responsible for funding (or not funding) NASA — see no upside for sending astronauts to space except national pride.
But if Congress could be convinced that national security against existential risk, money from space mining and precious tech innovation for U.S. citizens would be gained by supporting space exploration, then maybe they would vote to enlarge NASA's programs. This in turn would spur both the private space industry and transhumanism tech that makes all our lives better. This type of thinking should be a priority for whoever ends up in Congress and the White House come 2017.

MK2 Design
The MK2 now offers a fin less solution aimed at cable riders who ride without fins. The solution allows you to insert an M5 screw through the board, fastened topside with a wig nut. Both A2 grade stainless steel for added quality. This solution offers a secure fixing with minimal drag allowing you to capture footage without interfering to your ride.
I'm a Product Designer and wakeboarding enthusiast based in Cornwall, UK. I bought a GoPro back in the summer of 2013 and I was surprised to find no mounts available to allow you to securely fasten a GoPro to a wakeboard. This problem lead me to design and prototype the KB Mount for GoPro.
What's great about my design is it's:
Quick & easy to fasten
Durable & lightweight
Relatively cheap
Allows you to capture unique footage
The funds raised will allow me to get a tool produced so I can injection mould the KB Mount and produce a first batch of products. I could seek funding myself but I wanted to be sure there was a viable market before committing to this capital expenditure. Therefore, I felt Kickstarter would be a good idea to see if there was enough interest internationally for such a product.
Development
Prototype: Having now prototyped the KB Mount, I believe I have a great product which will be highly useful for riders wanting to capture a unique angle from the board, whilst knowing that their GoPro is safely secured to the board.
Mounting versatility: The diagram below shows the vast array of board manufacturers this mount is designed to work with. One of the three main Countersunk slots will always require a screw to be located; then depending on what board you have, the second screw will be located as shown below.
Supplied screws: Each KB Mount will be supplied with two high quality fasteners.What screws you require, depends on what board you have. It will be either of the following:
A2 Stainless 10-24 UNC Phillips Countersunk Screws (Length 1-1/4")
A2 Stainless 1/4 UNC Phillips Countersunk Screws (Length 5/8, 3/4 or 1")
Leash option: As seen in the image below, I have used a standard GoPro surfing leash. This is possible for added security, however it does make it more time consuming to fit the bracket. The Leash will be included with the product.
Changeable viewing angle: This can be changed by moving the screw between the three main CSK slots. The maximum angle you can film at is either 10 or 20 degrees depending on what board you have. For example if you have a Slingshot board you can have 20 degrees maximum. If you have a Ronix board 10 degrees is your maximum angle as the increased distance between screws limits your viewing angle.

Project time scale
As you can see from the plan below I'm hoping to release this product early into the 2014 wakeboarding season. I believe these timescales to be realistic and achievable.
Personal Statement
By backing the KB Mount for GoPro you are showing me that it's a product that boarders want, enabling me to have confidence that there is a valid market.
On top of that you are allowing me to take my first product to market which is incredibly exciting and I'm keen to make this happen.
Thank you for your support,
Alex

Let me start by saying this: Imad Kreidieh is the example of a Lebanese official that we need more of in every form of governance. Not only has they put their predecessor to shame in the 8 weeks he's been heading Ogero, but they have also done so to every single Lebanese politician with how they have been clear, thorough and keen on making sure transparency is key in everything they do.
As such, Mr. Kreidieh held a Facebook live Q&A which you can watch in its entirety here:
In the parts that are relevant to us as consumers without all kinds of tech backgrounds, the highlights are as follows:
New plans with faster speeds and bigger quotas as well as reduced pricing should be available in the next 2-3 weeks pending a decree from the Ministry of Telecommunications.
Internet will not be as fast as it can be until infrastructure is changed, notably that of exchange sites (or centrals). The project regarding this will have its tender on April 19th with implementation following soon after. Drastic improvements should start being available in the Fall of 2017.
Unlimited internet might come back to Ogero users.
New ministry decree will slash the one month wait period between switching ISPs (Switching from Ogero to someone else or vice versa).
As for things that we will get to experience sooner rather than a later, Mr. Kreidieh announced opening up all of the possible internet speed in Beirut on three separate days, which will be April 9th (this Sunday), April 11th (next Tuesday) and April 13th (next Thursday).
Each day will see a different part of the Greater Beirut area receive as fast internet as possible, depending on how much your line can handle.
The regions are divided as such:
On April 9th: Badaro – Mazra3a – Elissar – Mrayjeh – Jdeideh -Hazmieh – Ras Beirut – Riyad el Solh.
On April 11th: Furn el Chebbek, Bir Hassan, Hadath, Amrousiye, Adlieh, Hamra, Choueifat, Nahr.
On April 13th: Dawra, Sin El Fil, Chiyah, Achrafieh, Mina el Hosn, Ras el Nab3, Dekwaneh.
Of course, since Lebanon isn't only Beirut as one of the people asking Kreidieh said, other regions in the country will have on Sunday starting April 15th to benefit from the same event whereby internet speed will be uncapped with each user getting as fast a service as possible depending on how far they are from the exchange.
Faster speeds will be available from 8AM till 8PM and feedback is requested either on Twitter at @ikreidieh, or by emailing ogero on thepeople@ogero.gov.lb or at Ogero's Facebook account, which you can access here.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks during President Trump's inauguration Friday. REUTERS/Carlos Barria
Minority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had a thankless job at the inauguration Friday. They were not there to re-litigate the election, although dozens of House Democrats stayed away in protest. They were not there to give a partisan speech. And yet the majority of the country who did not vote for President Trump wanted some sliver of hope and to show defiance. Schumer, we think, threaded the needle as effectively as one could have done. In doing so they wound up giving a much more “conservative” speech.
They began with a grownup view of the world as it is, not as a dystopian horror show (“we live in a challenging and tumultuous time, a quickly evolving, ever-more interconnected world, a rapidly changing economy that benefits too few while leaving too many behind, a fractured media, a politics frequently consumed by rancor. We face threats foreign and domestic”). They gave a nod to popular cynicism and alienation, but, unlike Trump, they urged their fellow Americans to raise their gaze and retain their very American optimism. “I stand here today confident in this great country for one reason: you, the American people,” they said. “We Americans have always been a forward-looking, problem-solving, optimistic, patriotic and decent people.”
To those that felt Trump ran and would govern only on behalf of their white working-class base, Schumer provided an inclusive portrait of America, but one that require we sacrifice to improve the country. In that regard they were less utopian, more realistic and, yes, more conservative in spirit than Trump. (“Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, whether we are immigrant or native-born, whether we live with disabilities or do not, in wealth or in poverty, we are all exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our country, and in our willingness to sacrifice our time, energy, and even our lives to making it a more perfect union.”) The phrase “more perfect union” acknowledges that we strive ever closer to an ideal, but with no guarantee of attaining nirvana.
Unlike Trump — who somehow believes they took an oath to the country (he should reread their oath — it is to the Constitution), Schumer sounded Madisonian by comparison. “We stand up for core democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution — the rule of law, equal protection for all under the law, the freedom of speech, press and religion — the things that make America, America.” That is how principled conservatives used to sound.
They chose, unlike Trump, to reach back into American history to read part of the famous letter of Union Maj. Sullivan Ballou to their wife Sara. (“I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing — perfectly willing — to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.”) From that they drew a lesson that seems to have eluded Trump. “It is because Sullivan Ballou and countless others believed in something bigger than themselves and were willing to sacrifice for it that we stand here today in the full blessings of liberty, in the greatest country on Earth,” Schumer said. “And that spirit lives on in each of us, Americans whose families have been here for generations and those who have just arrived. And I know that our best days are yet to come.” Schumer understands that America is not frozen in time (the 1950s) but grounded in history. (For Trump, America seems to have started the day they ran for president — hence, everything is record-setting, the biggest, the best, etc.)
A significant group in the audience was having none of it. Attendance was spotty but what Trumpkins lacked in numbers they made up for in rudeness and volume, booing, hooting and whistling throughout Schumer's speech. Was it the “rule of law” or the sacrifice of Sullivan Ballou they objected to? They, like Trump, were unthinking and unkind, unmannerly and unapologetic in their outbursts. Like the left-wing vandals in the streets the obnoxious Trumpkins care little for democracy — which necessitates respect for others, reasoned discourse, civility and self-restraint. One finds it increasingly difficult to empathize with the “forgotten men and women” who loudly proclaim their own victimhood while attacking America's foundational values.
Trump's speech was dark, foreboding, hostile and divisive, casting themselves as the beneficent strongman who can deliver to the American people a time machine in which the rest of the world lies prostrate (as it did at the end of World War II) and white males needed nothing beyond a high school education. They want to take back from one group (elites, the establishment, politicians, whoever) and give it to another (his voters). (In fact, their tax plan would do the opposite).
Schumer's remarks were optimistic, hopeful and unifying, recognizing that Americans through sacrifice and idealism make the country as a whole better. Schumer is a committed progressive, but their speech was closer in tone to Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush than Trump's was.
That, in turn, should remind Americans from the center-left to the center-right that they have more in common with one another — respect for the rule of law, historical perspective, idealism, tolerance and belief in American greatness (right here and now) — than either does with the extremes on the right and left. If we are to preserve “core democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution — the rule of law, equal protection for all under the law, the freedom of speech, press, and religion — the things that make America, America,” it will be the result of bipartisan fidelity to democratic norms and the courage to call out corruption, illegality, incompetence and meanness. Those who believe in the better angels of our nature will need to join forces to protect that which they hold dear from a president whose narcissism makes them incapable of understanding “the things that make America, America.”
If you're on a journey to make a great cup of coffee, look no further. Making coffee at home isn't as intimidating as it seems, and it doesn't take years of practice to brew some great coffee.
It does seem complicated at first. If you browse the Internet for coffee making advice, you'll see a lot of terms you don't know and many videos that outline complex processing for making coffee. And while there's definitely a learning curve to brewing, there are easy ways to get started.
You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on a café-level setup or months studying different techniques. We'll share with you some basic techniques that will take just a few weeks of dedicated practice to get down.
Once you've learned about types of coffee and coffee processing methods, you'll be able to choose a coffee that has some flavor notes you'll enjoy. Then it's time to get brewing!
When making coffee, there are two main methods for brewing: pour over (or drip) and immersion. We'll cover both types and tell you exactly what you need.
Making Coffee at Home
Think of how your coffeepot works. You pour water in the reservoir and fill the basket up with coffee. The water then drips through the coffee grounds and fills up the pot.
Imagine doing that process by hand. That's exactly what pour over coffee is.
The basic process consists of boiling water in a kettle, freshly grinding your coffee beans, placing the grounds in a device called a dripper, and then carefully pouring the water over the coffee.
It might seem like a lot of hard work at first, but for many coffee lovers, it's a ritual that grants a moment for peace. That might sound dramatic, but there's indeed something about meticulously pouring water over coffee that's relaxing.
You might have a few questions, so let's address those first.
Frequently Asked Questions
“Why not just use my coffeepot for making coffee?”
Sometimes, your coffeepot is the right answer. (You have to have the right one, of course, as some don't heat the water enough.) However, in many cases, a coffeepot doesn't make sense.
For example, if you want to just make one cup of coffee for yourself, using your coffeepot is overkill. Also, the pour over process can bring out more of the complexities in a coffee, allowing you to taste the flavor notes and enjoy it more.
“Do I have to freshly grind the beans? Why can't I just use preground?”
Freshly grinding is more important than you may think. In fact, you should spend more on your grinder than almost any other part of your pour over setup.
The main reason is that coffee, like many other foods, goes stale quickly. After it's ground and exposed to oxygen, coffee only stays flavorful for about 15 minutes. After that, it loses about 60% of its aroma, and its taste degrades as well. Think of the way an apple turns brown after it's cut and exposed to oxygen. The same thing is true of ground coffee.
In addition, preground coffee is often months old (and sometimes over a year old). It will taste bland and stale compared to freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee.
Finally, the particle size of the coffee grounds matters. When making coffee, you extract compounds from the coffee. The more even the size of the grounds, the more evenly you'll extract all the good stuff, and the better your cup will be.
That's why you shouldn't use a blade grinder for grinding coffee. It will just hack up the beans into pieces of all different sizes.
Instead, you should use a burr grinder. These grinders use circular burrs to grind the beans, and they provide a much more even grind. This will ultimately give you a better cup of coffee.
We highly recommend Baratza's grinders. The company is well known for its excellent prices and top-notch customer support. The Baratza Encore is an entry-level grinder that will take your coffee game to the next level.

“What are the differences between pour over and immersion brewing?”
Pour over brewing works in the same way as your coffeepot. Water is poured through the grounds and extracts the coffee molecules as it passes by. This usually takes the least amount of time and results in a bright, clean cup with a medium or light body.
Immersion brewing is a lot like steeping tea. The grounds float in hot water for a longer time to extract the right amount. This method typically results in a more robust cup of coffee with a lot of body to it.
Both have their strengths and their weaknesses, and we recommend trying both.
“What do I need to get started with making coffee?”
Besides a good burr grinder like the Baratza Encore, you'll need a few crucial items.
If you want to use a pour over method, you'll need a dripper. If you want to use the immersion method, you'll want a press of some sort.
Here's what you need for each method:
Coffee Gear for Pour Over
Dripper
A dripper is one of the main types of devices you can use to make coffee.
Drippers are like standalone coffeepot baskets. They're either flat-bottomed or conical, and there are many options to choose from.
There are three coffee drippers that have remained popular over the last several years, and they each have their own pros and cons. Let's look at all of them.
While the Kalita Wave isn't as popular as the V60 or Chemex, it is one of the more common flat bottom drippers.
It might not seem like there's a big difference between a conical dripper and a flat-bottomed dripper, there is. A flat bottom dripper is much more beginner-friendly because it naturally extracts the coffee more evenly. Basically, it gives you a wider margin of error, so if you mess up a little, the coffee will still taste good.
Because it's so forgiving, the Kalita Wave is our recommended dripper for beginners. We suggest the glass version, as some steel drippers can tear the filter papers due to their design.
If you want to brew small cups (around 8 oz), then go with the Kalita 155 instead of the larger 185 model.
And of course, don't forget to pick up filters. You can find the official 155 size filters here and the official 185 size filters here.
Shop the Kalita Wave on Amazon
The Hario V60 is arguably the most iconic dripper. Its conical shape is unmistakable, and there's at least one or two V60s in the majority of newer coffee shops all over the world.
Although the V60 looks simple enough, it's actually one of the more complex drippers to use. The large hole at the bottom means that you have to carefully control how fast the water drips through (a variable known as flow rate).
However, when you master it, the V60 produces an amazing cup of coffee. It highlights a coffee's brightness and fruitiness.
We recommend the ceramic V60 for overall aesthetics and function. Most people will only need a size 01, which is perfect for brewing 8-12 oz of coffee (enough for one person).
If you're okay with the idea of hot water going near plastic, then the plastic V60 is a lower-cost option.
And if you want to get really fancy, the V60 is available in steel and copper, although only the size 02 offers these materials, so we only recommend these if you'll be using the V60 to regularly make 12 oz or more.
You'll also need some filter papers for your new dripper. We recommend the white filters because the brown ones leave more of a papery taste.
Shop the Hario V60 on Amazon
The Chemex is also an iconic dripper, and it's been so acclaimed for its design that it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
While the 6-cup Chemex is the most famous model, the 3-cup Chemex is appropriate for most people since it can make up to 15 oz of coffee.
The Chemex is known for producing exceptionally clean cups of coffee because of the incredibly thick filters. Since they're thicker, the filters don't let as many oils through, so the result is a bright and tealike cup.
The Chemex comes in two versions. There's the all-glass Chemex with a handle and the Chemex with a wood collar and leather tie. Either option brews exactly the same, so no matter which one you get, you'll be on your way to making coffee that tastes great. (And don't forget the filters!)

Coffee Gear for Immersion Brewing
You may already have a French press. It's one of the most popular ways to make coffee.
The Bodum 3-cup Brazil French press is a great press for most people. It can make up to 12 oz. of coffee, and like any press, it's a breeze to use. Bodum's build quality is also excellent, so this won't be breaking anytime soon. (That said, be careful with the glass!)
With a French press, you may end up with some silt in the final cup, but there are some methods that mitigate this. If you don't mind a few stray grounds in your cup and prefer a fuller bodied taste, the French press is for you.
If you need to make more coffee than 12 oz., the 8-cup model is our recommendation.
Shop the Bodum French Press on Amazon
The Aeropress is a variation of the French press that produces an entirely different result.
It's become so popular that there are even championships like the World Aeropress Championship that encourage creative methods using this flexible coffee-making device.
The Aeropress will produce a smooth, balanced cup of coffee, but it will have slightly more body than what a pour over method will produce.
A couple of caveats here. First, the Aeropress is plastic, so for those of you who are afraid of the plastic leeching toxins into your brew, we recommend choosing another device for making coffee.
Second, it cannot make true espresso, despite what its marketing says. What it can make is a super concentrated cup of coffee that substitutes for espresso.

Kettle
As you might have expected from the idea of pour over coffee, the right kettle is a crucial element of a great pour over setup.
You probably have a kettle sitting in your kitchen, and you might be able to use it, but a word of warning––it's not ideal.
For most pour over setups, you want a gooseneck (also called a swan neck) kettle. These kettles have long, curved spouts that terminate in a smaller opening so that you can pour a thin stream of water over the coffee.
You can use a regular, non-gooseneck kettle with flat bottomed drippers, but we recommend only using a gooseneck for any conical drippers because they require more pouring precision.
A gooseneck kettle is not needed for immersion methods, so if you're using something like a French press or Aeropress, you can skip getting a gooseneck.
Here are our two recommended gooseneck kettles:
The Bonavita variable temperature kettle is the gooseneck of choice for countless coffee lovers around the world.
The kettle has a temperature setting mechanism, a timer feature, and sturdy build quality. It also offers a hold feature that allows you to keep the water at a set temperature for up to an hour.
It's electric so you can just plug in and go. And of course, the gooseneck tip gives you precise control over how much water you pour.
It's an all around fantastic kettle, and it's affordable to boot. It gets our top recommendation for making coffee at home.

It might be difficult to unpack all of the flavor in a Coava coffee, but once you learn to taste the nuances in a bean, you'll love what Coava has to offer.
Conclusion
These are all the items necessary for making coffee at home. Whether you choose a pour over or immersion setup, you can make a spectacular cup of coffee, so you don't end up falling asleep in your bed all day.

There is a fierce competition for a significant foothold in the multi-billion dollar doughnut industry, and it looks like no entity is profiting off that battle more than the National Hockey League.
NHL Playing Both Sides Against the Middle in the Doughnut Wars
Several years ago, the NHL agreed to a steadily-growing partnership with Canadian-based Tim Horton's. The quick-service restaurant became the title sponsor for the 2011 Tim Horton's Heritage Classic to initiate its multi-year contract.
As part of the partnership, Tim Horton's became the official breakfast, coffee, doughnut and quick-service restaurant of the NHL in Canada. A year later, the sponsorship grew to include the titling of the NHL All-Star Game.
Tim Horton's also secured individual franchise sponsorships with the Buffalo Sabres, Calgary Flames, Columbus Blue Jackets, Detroit Red Wings, Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks and Winnipeg Jets.
Before the 2015-16 season, Tim Horton's partnered with Upper Deck, who holds the license to produce hockey cards, to produce its own themed set of NHL cards available for purchase in its restaurants.
Meanwhile, Tim Horton's was also trying to nab more of a market share in the United States. In 2012, Dunkin' Donuts controlled 57.5 percent of the $11.6-billion American doughnut industry. Tim Horton's invasion into the United States began with a small cluster of locations in major metropolitan areas, like New York City‘s Penn Station. Those designs have since become much more ambitious, expanding to take on Dunkin' Donuts directly. An example is Tim Horton's current expansion into the Daytona, Florida, market.
Dunkin' Donuts hasn't been completely out of the hockey sponsorship game while Tim Horton's was expanding its partnership with the NHL, however. Coming into this season, Dunkin' had existing partnerships with many individual franchises, including the Anaheim Ducks, Arizona Coyotes, Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Nashville Predators, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, San Jose Sharks, St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning and Washington Capitals.
Whether it was because of the increasing pressure that Tim Horton's is applying, or because Dunkin' was already sponsoring nearly half of the league already, the partnership between Dunkin' and the NHL recently expanded to a nation-wide deal. Dunkin' now owns the same official product titles in the U.S. as Tim Horton's owns in Canada. This is the first nationwide professional sports league sponsorship for Dunkin', and its brand is now going to be visible to many of the same fans that Tim Horton's is paying the NHL to reach.
While the value of the Dunkin' partnership has not been disclosed, the NHL is now enjoying revenue streams from both Dunkin' Donuts and Tim Horton's on a national sponsor level. Both companies are trying to use hockey to sell their products, and the NHL is reaping the benefits.

Graffiti has a bad reputation, but remarkable street art is appearing in more and more cities. When done by skillful artists, street art really transforms and brings an area to life. Urban areas are commonly filled by these bright artistic creations. It may surprise you what are some of the best street art cities around the world.
Graffiti and street art is not always legal, which may be another reason why it's becoming increasingly popular. Street artists always have a message to convey. Also, these splashes of artistic creation provide a glimpse into the local culture. These creations transform boring or dilapidated buildings into bright and meaningful messages.
Street art is also generating more tourism. With it, cities become outdoor art museums with free admission and are definitely an attraction people are interested to see and photograph.
One of the most notable street artists is Banksy. This English graffiti artist loves making a statement through political activism, satire, and dark humour.
While New York City, Los Angeles, and London are famous for their street art, check out 7 more unique cities with some of the best street art around the world.
1. Berlin, Germany
The west side of Berlin was famously covered with graffiti and since the demolition of the Berlin wall, street artists are still working their way to leave their mark on the walls of Eastern Berlin. In some of the oddest places you can find stencil art, spat painted tags, mural art, faces, eyes, and whatever else you can imagine.
2. Austin, Texas
In Austin, “the live music capital of the world”, street art is as varied as their music scene. And the local slogan: “Keep Austin Weird”, surely is conveyed in the street art as well. The simplest of images are some of the most popular and famous in this city.
For example, the “Hi, How Are You?” mural has been intact for over 20 years and features the drawing that Kurt Cobain wore on their t-shirt. And the simple “I Love You So Much” sprayed on the wall of Jo's Coffee is another favourite for people to take a picture with and a popular engagement photoshoot spot.
And there's also the HOPE Outdoor Gallery, a community graffiti paint park that you can climb up and see a view of Austin.
3. Mexico City
Mexico City is the perfect canvas for talented street artists with a lot to say. Without a doubt one of the best street art cities. Murals, spray paint, stencils, tags, sketching markers, stickers, wheat paste, and more cover buildings, walls, and overpasses.
In this massive metropolis, you can find some of the best street art in the world created legally and illegally by both local and even international artists.
With a long historical background, since the post-revolution in the 1920s, the mural movement began as Mexico City embraced street art on its walls and nowadays we see a new movement exploding.
4. Lodz, Poland
With the support and encouragement of the city of Lodz, massive street paintings are appearing around this Polish city. The Urban Forms Foundation has the goal to create cultural reinvigoration of the city and it's working.
The project has attracted business, investment, and tourism. It's improving the quality and aesthetics of the city, and these artistic creations as big as 10 stories tall are a sight to behold.
5. Valparaiso, Chile
Valparaiso is a South American gem in the Pacific. A series of hillsides paint a landscape overlooking the sea. And this is another unique city you may not have imagined it has a vibrant street art scene.
The most visitor-friendly hills are Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepción filled with galleries, restaurants, bars, hotels, and yes, street art. Locals and businesses have embraced these artistic creations and some of the best artists get paid for their work.
6. Paris, France
There is so much to see in Paris. Art within the walls of famous museums of course, but also outside spanning across this stunning city. Paris definitely makes it to our best street art cities list.
Street art in Paris is very varied and unique, and each piece speaks a different message about life while subtly expressing secrets of the city. Very much poetic and sultry as the personality of the city itself.
7. Lisbon, Portugal
Lisbon is another city which started off with lots of graffiti, but recent projects and movements have given a boost to stunning urban art around the city. This city is eye candy for those with an aesthetic eye.
A definite open-air museum, where you can go street art sightseeing through the historic streets of Lisbon, while enjoying the coastal breeze, and stopping at a cafe to eat egg tarts.
These are just a few of the best street art cities around the world featuring amazing urban art.
How many of these have you visited? Did you explore the urban art around it?

We now bring you this transmission, directly from alternate universe evil (or are they the good ones?) Bizarro RPS:
John: Goodness, what a boring day it's been. Probably the least exciting in recorded history.
Jim: Here's an idle musing for you: joy is dead. And so is God.
Adam: Wouldn't it be amazing if a spiritual successor to Total Annihilation just made $2 million, a thinly veiled follow-up to Planescape: Torment was just announced, and an agonizingly long-awaited Half-Life remake finally launched – all in the same day?
John: Well, I mean, Ubisoft just announced its new always online double-DRM. If you disconnect from the Internet, it kills you. That's something, right? Something that kills you, I mean.
Alec: [Says nothing. Still on vacation. Evil vacation.]
Me, under the iron grip of the Neo-British Colonial Extermination Empire: Can I… ? Can I eat now? It's been days.
All: No.
So, right then. Black Mesa's out! For real. I'm downloading it right now, and John's apparently playing it as we speak. What a strange, amazing day. As you can imagine, download servers are getting pulverized into post-crowbar headcrab goo, so you might need to do a bit of digging. Here, however, are some options:
There are direct downloads everywhere, and Black Mesa's official site has done a nice job of gathering them in one place. Just in case the site goes down, though, here they all are: ModDB, FileShack, GameFront, Games.On.Net, and GamesConnect (down as of writing).
There are also torrents, which – due to overwhelming demand – aren't faring so well. Happily, however, I imagine tons more will spring up in the coming hours. Until then, though, you've got the official option (down as of writing), one over here as well, a Dropbox link, and a download from Pirate Bay that's allegedly not as loaded down right now.
You can also download the soundtrack, which – based on some brief snippets – seems pretty great! And, of course, all of this is completely free.
So, have at it. Now then, my download just broke halfway through, so I'm off to angrily hurl bricks at innocent bystanders and then try again.
Authorities in southern Ohio are trying to identify a body found not far from where several local women disappeared over the past year.
According to the Ross County Sheriff's Office, someone found a body in Massieville on Friday afternoon, in an area near Trego Creek road. The victim is female and police are investigating the death as a homicide, according to the Chillicothe Gazette.
Lt. Preston said the death is being investigated as a homicide. #cgnow pic.twitter.com/sSGaRNJzkX — Caitlin Turner (@Cait_E_Turner) May 29, 2015
Massieville is a small town located about five miles south of Chillicothe, where several women have disappeared or turned up dead, sparking fears among family and friends that a serial killer or sex traffickers are on the loose.
A driver found the woman's body after spotting a pair of sandals on the side of the road, according to WBNS-TV. The dead woman lay in a pool of blood nearby, the witness told the TV station.
Them body was there for a few hours, according to a coroner's estimate reported by WSYX-TV.
MISSING WOMEN: (Story Continues Below)
The missing women have been identified as:
Charlotte Trego, 27, missing since May 3, 2014.
Wanda Lemons, 37, missing since Nov. 3, 2014
Tiffany Sayre, 26, missing since May 11, 2015
Each of the women, according to police, were involved in the same social circles.
Family members recently interviewed by The Huffington Post said they suspect each of the cases in Chillicothe are linked. Some even believe other cases, including the May 2014 death of 30-year-old Tameka Lynch and the December 2014 death of 20-year-old Shasta Himelrick, could be connected.
Evidence backing a controversial sulfur-rich model of the Earth's oceans 1.8 billion years ago has been uncovered in molecular fossils.
Oxygen levels in the Earth's atmosphere began to rise just over two billion years ago. By 1.8 billion years ago iron formations in the earth's geology had all disappeared because of this oxygen. But the amount of oxygen in the oceans immediately after this so-called mid-Proterozoic time is unknown. Opinion has been split between oxygen-rich oceans and a mainly oxygen free (anoxic), sulfur-rich oceans - both can account for the disappearing iron formations.
Jochen Brocks and colleagues at the Australian National University found 1.64 billion year old molecular fossil remains of purple and green pigments produced by phototrophic sulfur bacteria. These molecular fossils provide the first data in favour of the sulfur model of the oceans. 'The ocean north of Australia may indeed have been vastly anoxic, toxic for complex life and coloured with a shade of purple,' said Brocks.
The fossils came from mid-Proterozoic rocks from the Barney Creek formation of the McArthur basin in northern Australia. Molecular fossils of eukaryotes - complex nucleus-containing life forms, which evolved into current plant and animals - were absent from the rocks.
This finding, combined with the sulfur-bacteria fossils, 'describe a marine ecosystem fundamentally different from anything that we know today,' said Brocks. 'If indeed the oceans were sulfidic during this middle period of Earth's history, it would rewrite much of what we've believed about a fifth of the planets history. Geochemical cycles would have been fundamentally different and many life-essential elements, such as nitrogen and copper would have been rare. It would seem that this is the reason why the world was ruled by bacteria for such a long time.' Katharine Sanderson
With sugar sales up, the Sugar Association last year ended its Sweet by Nature campaign, which pointed out that sugar is found in fruits and vegetables, said Andy Briscoe, president of the association. “Obviously, demand is moving in the right direction so we are taking a break,” Mr. Briscoe said.
Blamed for hyperactivity in children and studied as an addictive substance, sugar has had its share of image problems. But the widespread criticism of high-fructose corn syrup — the first lady, Michelle Obama, has said they will not give their children products made with it — has made sugar look good by comparison.
Most scientists do not share the perception. Though research is still under way, many nutrition and obesity experts say sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are equally bad in excess. But, as is often the case with competing food claims, the battle is as much about marketing as it is about science.
Some shoppers prefer cane or beet sugar because it is less processed. High-fructose corn syrup is produced by a complex series of chemical reactions that includes the use of three enzymes and caustic soda.
Others see the pervasiveness of the inexpensive sweetener as a symbol of the ill effects of government subsidies given to large agribusiness interests like corn growers.
But the most common argument has to do with the rapid rise of obesity in the United States, which began in the 1980s, not long after industrial-grade high-fructose corn syrup was invented. As the amount of the sweetener in the American diet has expanded, so have Americans.
Although the price differential has since dropped by about half, high-fructose corn syrup came on the market as much as 20 percent cheaper than sugar. And it was easier to transport. As a result, the sweetener soon turned up in all kinds of products, including soda, bread, yogurt, frozen foods and spaghetti sauce.

But with sugar newly ascendant, the makers of corn syrup are fighting back. Last fall, the Corn Refiners Association mounted a multimillion-dollar defense, making sure that an advertisement linking to the association's Web site, sweetsurprise.com, pops up when someone types “sugar” or “high-fructose corn syrup” into some search engines.
In one television advertisement, a mother pours fruit punch into a cup while another scolds them because the punch contains high-fructose corn syrup. When pressed to explain why it is so bad, the complaining mother is portrayed as a speechless fool.
Audrae Erickson, president of the Corn Refiners Association, said consumers were being duped.
“When they discover they are being misled into thinking these new products are healthier, that's the interesting angle,” Ms. Erickson said in an interview.
Although researchers are looking into the effects of fructose on liver function, insulin production and other possible contributors to excess weight gain, no major studies have made a definitive link between high-fructose corn syrup and poor health. The American Medical Association says that when it comes to obesity, there is no difference between the syrup and sugar.

And, Ms. Erickson added, the Food and Drug Administration considers both sweeteners natural.
Dr. Robert H. Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco Children's Hospital, said: “The argument about which is better for you, sucrose or HFCS, is garbage. Both are equally bad for your health.”
Both sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are made from glucose and fructose. The level of fructose is about 5 percent higher in the corn sweetener.
Dr. Lustig studies the health effects of fructose, particularly on the liver, where it is metabolized. Part of their research shows that too much fructose — no matter the source — affects the liver in the same way too much alcohol does.
But all of that is irrelevant to some food manufacturers, who are switching to sugar as a result of extensive taste testing and consumer surveys.
“For consumers, their perception is reality,” said Jim Sieple, a senior vice president for Log Cabin syrup, a 120-year-old brand in the Pinnacle Foods Group that this month announced it had stopped using high-fructose corn syrup.

Sugar's comeback is not entirely a backlash against the corn sweetener. Market researchers say that with the economy so unsettled, people want to control what they can. Choosing organic, less processed or so-called natural foods is a relatively inexpensive way to do that.
“Rightly or wrongly, that means consumers are more attracted to sugar,” said Kevin Higar, senior manager at Technomics, a market research company.
Chefs and connoisseurs have also driven sugar's rehabilitation. Although even a sugar expert would be hard pressed to tell the difference between the taste of cane and beet sugar, some enthusiasts have elevated cane sugar to near cult status.
The Coke that is made from sugar for Jews who avoid corn during Passover has become so popular among cane-sugar fans that some stores have taken to rationing it.
At Jason's, a chain of delis with 200 restaurants in 27 states, cane sugar has replaced high-fructose corn syrup in everything except a few carbonated beverages. “Part of this is a huge rebellion against HFCS,” said Daniel Helfman, a spokesperson for the chain, “but part of it is taste.”
To researchers and nutritionists who study obesity and the effects of sugar on the body, the resurrection of sugar is maddening.
Pat Crawford of the Center for Weight and Health at the University of California, Berkeley, remembers when sugar was such a loaded word that cereal makers changed the name of products like Sugar Pops to Corn Pops.
Even though overall consumption of caloric sweeteners is starting to drop, Dr. Crawford says an empty calorie is still an empty calorie. And it does not matter whether people think sugar is somehow “retro,” a word used to promote new, sugar-based versions of Pepsi and Mountain Dew called Throwback.
“If people really want to go back to where we were, that means not putting sugar in everything,” they said. “It means keeping it to desserts.”
The Lion Soaking: Lioness takes no chances as they carry nine-week-old cub across fast-flowing river
Lioness dangles nine-week-old cub in their claws and they cross river
Makes their way across Ntiakitiak River in Kenya to join rest of their pride
Stunning images captured by Greek photographer Kyriakos Kaziras
Them jaws clamped firmly around the scruff of their tiny cub's neck, this plucky lioness is taking no chances as they tackle a risky river crossing.
As their nine-week-old youngster dangles beneath her, the mother skips gingerly between impromptu stepping stones.
These stunning images capture the heart-stopping moment the lioness braved choppy waters, clasping their little one's nape, as they made their way to join the rest of the pride on the other side of the river.
You're too old to be carried, Simba: The mother starts their perilous journey across the river in Kenya
Careful, Mum! I'm not a sea lion... The parent leaps across the fast-slowing river with the cub in their jaw
Cat-astrophe! I knew you'd slip: The pair splash into the water of the Ntiakitiak River
Amazingly, the cub escaped with only a sodden coat as its mother safely negotiated the fast-flowing waters of the Ntiakitiak River in Kenya's Masai Mara game reserve.
Greek photographer Kyriakos Kaziras managed to capture the moment during a trip in December.
Paul Goldstein, another photographer and owner of Kicheche Bush Camp, where Mr Kaziras was based, said: ‘Kyriakos and their guide had spent early morning with the large Enkoyanai pride.
There had been plenty of rain and the Ntiakitiak River, normally a trickle, was a swollen torrent.

'The risks of such a journey were very real, particularly as the cub was at least a month older than normal “carrying age”.

It was a dramatic day for the Chinese families of those aboard the missing plane. After days of waiting at a Beijing hotel for information, they have become increasingly angry and frustrated with the Malaysian authorities.
They feel that, all along, the Malaysian government, military and airline officials have hidden information about the search for their relatives.
The vast majority of the family members believe their parents, sisters, brothers and children are still alive, somewhere.
Monday's announcement from the Malaysian prime minister appears to have pushed the families past the boiling point.
The Chinese and Malaysian governments are the same. They're all corrupt Chinese relative of missing passenger
Why would the Malaysians give up hope for the search before locating the plane, they asked.
On Tuesday, the families showed they were not willing to wait patiently for answers any longer.
Critical of Beijing
They organised themselves into an effective pressure group, pushing past Chinese police lines multiple times and launching a rare public march on the streets of Beijing.
Yelling "We want the truth!" and "The Malaysians are murderers!", they reached the embassy in less than an hour.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Relatives vented their anger outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing
The protest yielded some results. Shortly after they were bussed back to the hotel where they have camped for the past two weeks, the families met with the Malaysian ambassador and several relatively high-ranking Chinese officials from the central government.
But notably, the families also seem to become more critical of Beijing.
At the start of the meeting, the BBC has learnt, a representative of the family group told the other relatives that they were not strong enough to demand answers from the Malaysians on their own. They needed their own government, the Communist leadership in Beijing, to support them.
A few minutes later, several high-ranking Chinese officials arrived in the meeting room, the deputy secretary of the State Council and the deputy transportation minister among them.

After delivering brief speeches, the Chinese delegation got up to leave, but they were quickly shouted down by the families.
What we know Flight MH370 to Beijing took off from Kuala Lumpur on Saturday 8 March at 00:41 local time (16:41 GMT Friday)
It diverted from its planned flight path, and contact between the plane and ground controllers ceased less than an hour after take-off; no distress signal or message was sent
Last contact with air traffic controllers at 01:19 Malaysian time, after which all on-board communications ceased when the plane's transponder was switched off
Plane's movements picked up by different countries' military radar and satellites after this, providing incomplete information about its course

"We need our government to work for us," shouted some of the relatives. "The Chinese and Malaysian governments are the same. They're all corrupt."
Others leapt to the Chinese government's defence: "Long live Chairman Xi," they yelled, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The ruckus continued when the Malaysian ambassador arrived at the meeting, two independent sources have confirmed to the BBC. They were cursed by the Chinese relatives and many questions were shouted in their direction.
At one point, we are told, the Malaysian ambassador wanted to leave, but the Chinese families wanted to force them to stay with them.
The Chinese authorities intervened to allow the ambassador to leave the meeting room, to the disgust of some of the relatives.
Little patience
If anger continues to build against the Chinese leadership, the families could be entering very dangerous territory.
In the past, the Communist authorities tolerated mild protests by groups who had been publicly wronged, including parents whose children were sickened by tainted milk formula or families who lost children when their schools collapsed during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

However, in both of those instances, Beijing's patience for those groups quickly ended once the families organised and began issuing demands.
Chinese police are now preventing journalists from meeting family members inside the Beijing hotel where the relatives receive their daily briefings - an ominous sign that the government will not accept any more public protests.

Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty (retitled Dune II: Battle for Arrakis in Europe and for the Mega Drive/Genesis port) is a Dune video game developed by Westwood Studios and released by Virgin Interactive in Jan 1, 1992. It is based upon David Lynch's 1984 movie Dune, an adaptation of Frank Herbert's science fiction novel of the same name.
While not necessarily the first real-time strategy (RTS) game (elements of which previously appeared in Stonkers, The Ancient Art of War, Command HQ, and particularly Herzog Zwei), Dune II established the format that would be followed for years to come. As such, Dune II was the archetypal "real-time strategy" game. Striking a balance between complexity and innovation, it was a huge success and laid the foundation for the coming Command & Conquer, Warcraft, Age of Empires and StarCraft series, and many other RTS games.
Emperor Frederick IV of House Corrino is desperate for the harvesting of the valuable drug melange (also known as 'the spice'), found on only the planet Arrakis, to pay off all of their debt incurred on internecine wars with family members. To achieve this, they now offer the sole governorship of Arrakis to the House (Atreides, Harkonnen, and Ordos) which delivers the most spice for him. War begins as deputations from all three Houses arrive on Arrakis.
The player is a military commander from a House of their choice. In the first few missions the objectives are to establish successfully a base on an unoccupied territory of Arrakis, to harvest spice, and to defeat intruders. Later, when the three Houses divide Arrakis among them, the player has to assault and capture enemy territories. When the player dominates Arrakis on the world map, the two other enemy factions ally against their common enemy. The ultimate final showdown is the battle between the player's House against three enemy sides, among them Frederick's forces the Sardaukar (an unplayable elite force whose heavy infantry are particularly powerful). The final cutscene is different for each House, in consonance with their very disparate world views.
The player takes the role of the commander of one of the three interplanetary houses, the Atreides, the Harkonnen or the Ordos, with the objective of wresting control of Arrakis from the other two houses. House Ordos is not featured in the Dune novels and is mentioned only in the non-canon Dune Encyclopedia. The basic strategy in the game is to harvest spice from the treacherous sand dunes using a harvester vehicle, convert the spice into credits via a refinery and to build military units with these acquired credits in order to fend off and destroy the enemy.
The game map initially starts with a fog of war covering all area which is not covered by the player's units range of view. As the units explore the map, the darkness is removed. Unlike later games such as Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, the fog of war is lifted forever with initial exploration, it does not become dark once more when units leave the area.
In addition to enemy incursions, there are other dangers; like the marauding gigantic sandworm, capable of swallowing vehicles and infantry whole but blocked by rocky terrain. The player can only build on rocky terrain, but must build concrete foundations before to avoid deterioration of the structures due to the harsh weather conditions although in general, structures will gradually decay over time regardless of the presence of those concrete slabs due to the asupervisorstioned weather conditions. Spice fields are indicated by orange coloration on the sand, darker orange indicating high concentration. Some spice may be concealed as bumps on the terrain (a 'spice bloom') that become spice fields when they are shot at, or when a unit runs over them (the unit is destroyed in the ensuing 'spice blow').
The player is presented a map of the planet Arrakis before most missions, where they can choose the next territory to play in among two or three. This affects primarily the enemy house fought in the next mission, as all missions except the first two require the complete destruction of the enemy. Nine territories must be fought, irrespective of house, to reach the endgame.
Dune II was one of the most influential games in the real-time strategy genre, particularly in Westwood's own Command & Conquer series. Though not every feature was unique, its specific combination of a fog of war, mouse-based military micromanagement, and an economic model of resource-gathering and base-building became the hallmark of the RTS genre. It served as the template for subsequent real-time strategy games. Chris Taylor has stated that Dune II and Command & Conquer were great inspirations, driving them to leave Electronic Arts to create Total Annihilation.

Disney will soon be testing allocated seating for Fantasmic! performances at Disney's Hollywood Studios.
During the test period, no advance FastPass+ reservations will be available, and instead, guests will be invited to visit a FastPass+ kiosk in the park on the day of the show.
The FastPass+ kiosk will then assign either a specific seat, row or section - depending on the day of the test.
We've been told that on July 21 and 22 2015, the test will be allocating specific seats to guests. On July 23 and 24, the system will be allocating specific rows, and finally on July 27 and 28, just a section in the amphitheater will be allocated.
The Hollywood Hills Amphitheater has seating for over 7000 guests, and the show's popularity frequently sees guests arriving a couple of hours before show time.
Disney is keen to reduce the pre-arrival time to around 30 minutes maximum, and it appears that the tests are designed to look at different methods of eliminating seating anxiety and reassuring guests that their position in the show will be available without arriving hours before the show.
This is the second test in recent times at Fantasmic! The park has recently tested delivery of food and merchandise to guests once seated inside the amphitheater.

If you've been reading my weekly posts covering newly released apps, you may have noticed an interesting trend lately. Several German television networks have been releasing apps for the Fire TV. In the last 24 hours alone, there have been 10 new apps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for the Fire TV from German television providers.
If these were old apps receiving Fire TV compatibility, I'd probably just chalk it up to savvy developers updating their apps to be as broad as possible. However, what's strange is that many of these apps are brand new and, as far as I can tell, only compatible with the Fire TV and no other devices. To top it off, several of these apps are geographically restricted to not allow installation from the United States.
Ask yourself, why would a company create an app exclusively for a device not sold in the only country that can use the app? This is entirely speculation on my part, but if you ask me, it's because a German Amazon Fire TV release is just around the corner.

Is Model-View-Controller dead on the front end?
Alex Moldovan Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 9, 2016
More and more front-end developers are adopting unidirectional architectures. So what's the future for the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach?
In order to understand how we got to this point, let's first review the evolution of front-end architecture.
Over the past four years, I've worked on a great deal of web projects and spent a good amount of time architecting front ends and integrating framework into them.
Before 2010, JavaScript — that programming language jQuery was written in — was used mostly for adding DOM manipulation to traditional websites. Developers didn't seem to care much about the architecture itself. Things like the revealing module pattern were good enough to structure our codebases around.
Our current discussion of front-end vs back-end architecture only came about in late 2010. This is when developers started taking the concept of a single page application seriously. This is also when frameworks like Backbone and Knockout started to become popular.
Since many of the principles these frameworks were built around were quite new at the time, their designers had to look elsewhere for inspiration. They borrowed practices that were already well established for server-side architecture. And at that moment, all the popular server-side frameworks involved some sort of implementation of the classic MVC model (also known as MV* because of its variations).
When React.js was first introduced as a rendering library, many developers mocked it because they perceived its way of dealing with HTML in JavaScript as counter-intuitive. But they overlooked the most important contribution that React brought on the table — Component Based Architecture.
React did not invent components, but it did take this idea one step further.
This major breakthrough in architecture was overlooked even by Facebook, when they advertised React as the “V in the MVC.”
On a side note, I still have nightmares after reviewing a codebase which had both Angular 1.x and React working together.
2015 brought us a major shift in mindset — from the familiar MVC pattern to the Unidirectional Architectures and Data Flows derived from Flux and Functional Reactive Programming, supported by tools like Redux or RxJS.
So where did it all go wrong for MVC?
MVC is still probably the best way to deal with the server side. Frameworks like Rails and Django are a pleasure to work with.
The problems stem from the fact that the principles and separations that MVC introduced on the server aren't the same as on the client.
Controller-View Coupling
Below is a diagram of how the View and the Controller are interacting on the server. There are only two touch points between them, both crossing the boundary between the client and the server.
Server MVC
When you move to MVC on the client, there's a problem. Controllers resemble what we call “code-behind.” The Controller is highly dependent on the View. In most framework implementations, it's even created by the View (as is the case with, for example, ng-controller in Angular).
Client MVC
Additionally, when you think of the Single Responsibility Principle, this is clearly breaking the rules. The client controller code is dealing with both event handling and business logic, at a certain level.
Fat Models
Think a bit about the kind of data you store in a Model on the client side.
On one hand, you have data like users and products, which represent your Application State. On the other hand, you need to store the UI State — things like showTab or selectedValue.
Similar to the Controller, the Model is breaking the Single Responsibility Principle, because you don't have a separate way of managing UI State and Application State.
So where do components fit into this model?
Components are: Views + Event Handling+ UI State.
The diagram below shows how you actually split the original MVC model to obtain the components. What's left above the line is exactly what Flux is trying to solve: managing Application State and Business Logic.
With the popularity of React and component-based architecture, we saw the rise of unidirectional architectures for managing application state.
One of the reasons these two go so well together so well is that they cover the classic MVC approach entirely. They also provide a much better separation of concerns when it comes to building front-end architectures.
But this is no longer a React story. If you look at Angular 2, you'll see the exact same pattern being applied, even though you have different options for managing application state like ngrx/store.
There wasn't really anything MVC could have done better on the client. It was doomed to fail from the beginning. We just needed time to see this. Through this five-year process, front-end architecture evolved into what it is today. And when you think about it, five years isn't such a long time for best practices to emerge.
MVC was necessary in the beginning because our front end applications were getting bigger and more complex, and we didn't know how to structure them. I think it served its purpose, while also providing a good lesson about taking a good practice from one context (the server) and applying it to another (the client).
So what does the future hold?
I don't think that we will come back to the classic MVC architecture anytime soon for our front end apps.
As more and more developers start to see the advantages of components and unidirectional architectures, the focus will be on building better tools and libraries that go down that path.
Will this kind of architecture be the best solution five years from now? There's a good chance of that happening, but then again, nothing is certain.
Five years ago, no one could have predicted how we would end up writing apps today. So I don't think that it's safe to place the bets for the future now.
Market Tower: More on Parking, Public Spaces, and the Case for Going Big
Rendering via Schooley Caldwell.
Wednesday's news that the City of Columbus has chosen the Wood Companies and Schiff Capital to develop the parking lot next to the North Market generated plenty of discussion about the plan, which proposes building a 35-story tower on the site. When Columbus Underground sat down to discuss the proposal earlier this week with the development team and representatives of the city and the North Market, there was plenty of useful information that didn't make it into the main story. With that in mind, we've compiled some additional excerpts from that conversation, read on for more.
The group stressed that a lot of thought was given to the first two floors of the new building, the plaza along Spruce Street, and the public atrium that would connect the new building with the historic market.
Mark Wood, President of the Wood Companies: One of the things we thought was really critical was the way the first and second floor interacted with the market. Our proposal was a little bit different than some of the others in that the entire footprint of the ground floor, and really the second floor, was not consumed by parking, since we're going underground with parking.
The ground floor of the tower has been designed to be very flexible, to allow the market to take on more or less space, so they have room for expansion. Also with the new plaza, we think that it will be much more welcoming for pedestrians, and a great space for the farmers market.
Steve Schoeny, Director of Development, City of Columbus: It's important to maintain that sight line from the convention center through to the market — people come out of the convention center, look around and see the North Market sign. They've maintained that and enhanced it, making it even easier for people to cross the street and also creating a whole new front door to the market. Vine Street will continue to be more of the back of the house, where cars enter the garages…where the loading dock is.
Wood: The restaurant spaces on Spruce are meant to kind of activate the street even more, coming from High. And there's even an opportunity for second floor restaurants, with balconies overlooking the plaza. We purposely set back the development to allow for that plaza to be developed.
Also, with the atrium in the middle, we're creating this public space, a gathering spot.
Schoeny: The atrium space is really important in a couple of ways. One, it becomes much more of a gathering space – today, the market is used as gathering space kind of in spite of itself. It's very utilitarian…it's all concrete outside, the route to get upstairs is circuitous.
But this now becomes another great “third space,” and also opens up another revenue stream for the market. They can program it, lease it out, for convention goers, corporate events, weddings, event space. It will be really unique, with a very Columbus character.
Wood: You'll be able to go straight up from the parking into the atrium, and then there'll be another prominent staircase up to second floor. And with seating for the market in the atrium, that opens up the space that is currently used for seating to be used in other ways.
Various reasons were given for the decision to go big with the design – at 35 floors, it was the tallest of all the proposals for the site.
Joel Lilly, COO and CFO of Schiff Capital: We wanted to stand apart. We have said we wouldn't do this anywhere else — we are not going around building 35-story towers just anywhere. We wanted something that could be seen, and that would establish, that's where the market is. So the idea started forming early on, really in our first conversations with Schooley Caldwell about the project.
Wood: The first several floors of the building were designed to complement the historic masonry scale of the neighborhood, as it sits today, but we also think that there's a lot of value to being able to see this tall, sleek building.
So we started with the base, looking at how does it impact the market and how does it complement the neighborhood as it is today? We wanted to activate the ground floor and the second floor, so we didn't want them consumed by parking. We knew that the public plaza area was really critical to the market, with the sight line down Spruce from the convention center.
Also, I've been in Goodale Park many times, when people from out of town will come up to me and ask, where is the market? So the tower is about visibility too.
Lilly: The residential portion is a big driver for the market and of their success, so when you do all of that programming on the first two floors, and with parking on three and four, you're kind of starting on floor five. At that point, you can't just do a couple floors of apartments. We also didn't want to take this whole massing of the base all the way up, so you have just a big block. And once you start setting it back, with a smaller tower, you only have so many units per floor, you've got to get some height to it, to drive that scale.
North Market Executive Director Rick Harrison Wolfe: We need you guys, and you need the market. I don't control the people who walk through the doors — the community shops and buys groceries, tourists and convention-goers do not. People say, oh, having more people living nearby won't make a difference, but really it's the difference between our fresh markets surviving or not surviving.
For Doug from the Fish Guys, if they have 100 more people buying fresh fish from them – this is not a Whole Foods or a big supermarket, where they do that in an hour – that's a big deal for him, and for our produce as well. Hopefully we can increase the fresh presence, having that in front of us.
Another unique element of the Wood/Schiff proposal is parking on the third and fourth floors of the new building that would connect via a bridge to the existing Vine Street garage. The two floors of parking are designed so that they could be converted to another use in the future, if driverless cars or other technological advances renders the parking in the building obsolete.
Lilly: The bridge from the Vine Street garage, it would be a two-level bridge – probably with a driving lane and a pedestrian lane on each level – that would connect and then you could come across on the third or fourth floors. We think it'll be great for driving traffic to that garage, where the demand now is high only during the day. It could hold extra parking for our residents or guests, or even in the daytime people could drive over to the two floors of parking in the new building if the Vine Street garage is full, so we can have that fluid relationship between the two. We also will have the chance to put up signage on that bridge, which will help people find a garage that is often missed now by drivers.
Wood: We think it's a nice opportunity for some shared parking. We would have used up a lot of the footprint of the first and second floor of the new building with ramps, but that really wanted to be activated.
Wolf: Yeah, I'd really like us to see, whatever that business on Vine Street ends up being, if it's the type of place that complements the market, allows you to buy things like toilet paper and kitty litter, then that's better than just a bunch of parking ramps.
The parking flow now is painful – and I take responsibility because we have bad parking equipment – but really, the ramps are already there, let's use them, instead of having to build a whole other set. And flow-wise, I think it's brilliant.
Lilly: And who's to say what the parking needs are going to be ten to 20 years from now? Our plan is that those two floors of parking in the building could be converted at some point, since there aren't ramps, and we made the ceiling heights appropriate for an office use.
Wolfe: This was the only proposal that thought through that, which I was very impressed with, because things are changing quickly.

TORONTO - The Liquor Control Board of Ontario is reporting another record year for sales and the money it turns over to the provincial government.
Figures released by the board today show net sales of $4.710 billion for 2011-12, up $218 million or 4.9 per cent over 2010-11.
The board transferred a record $1.63 billion dividends to the Ontario government, $80 million or 5.2 per cent more than in 2010-11.
Net income rose $98 million to $1.658 billion, up 6.3 per cent.
The board says it was the 17th straight year of record sales and 18th consecutive record dividend to the province to help pay for public services.
"Net sales growth resulted from consumers trading up to premium products, incremental sales from new stores, an appealing product mix and effective marketing," LCBO President and CEO Bob Peter said in a statement.
"Good expense control and inventory management also allowed us to capitalize on increased dollar sales and exceed last year's dividend in a challenging economy."
Ontario VQA table wines rose by nine per cent, outpacing LCBO wine sales as a whole which increased by 5.7 per cent.
Ontario craft beers led all product segments with almost 45 per cent growth.
Vintages, LCBO's fine wine and premium spirits business unit, saw sales rise 10.2 per cent or $39 million over the previous year to $425 million.
While most people are content to let the dead remain dead – even if they would dearly like to see their loved just one last time – that is certainly not always the case. Take, for example, Giovanni Aldini. Although many have seen fit to dismiss them as an outright crank, or as a definitive mad professor-type, this is not the case at all.
Born in 1762, Aldini, at the age of thirty-six, achieved the position of a professor of physics at the University of Bologna, in northern Italy. Although much of their work was focused upon issues of a very much down to earth nature, there was a darker, and highly controversial side to Aldini, too.
It's important to note that Aldini was the nephew of one Luigi Galvani, also of the University of Bologna. Galvani – from whose name the term “galvanism” is directly derived – was someone who spent a great deal of time experimenting on dead frogs.
Galvani came to realize that while it was not possible to breathe new life into the dead creatures, directing an electric current through the spinal cord of the frogs caused the creatures to twitch and move as if they were alive – or had been successfully brought back from the other side.
Not only was Aldini deeply influenced by the work of their uncle Luigi, they took matters yet another step further. It was, in fact, just about the most controversial step of them all that anyone could take.
To say that Aldini literally reanimated the dead would be incorrect. It would be right on target, however, to say that they animated them. And they did so in a fashion that followed directly in the path of Luigi Galvani. But, Aldini's grisly experiments were not undertaken on frogs: their test-subjects were nothing less than the human dead.
Such was the scale of the public and media fascination with Aldini's work in the fields of galvanism – that some even perceived as being outright devilish in nature – they traveled the length and breadth of Europe demonstrating how, in an uncanny and disturbing fashion, the dead could be made to appear not quite so dead, after all. As was the case with their Uncle Luigi, Aldini's work was all based around the careful application and use of electric currents.
Certainly, the most memorable and fear-inducing of all Aldini's experiments occurred in 1803, at the London, England-based Royal College of Surgeons. Aldini's test-subject was a man named George Forster, who had been hanged by the neck on January 18, 1803, after being found guilty of murdering – by drowning – both their wife and their youngest child.
Aldini wasted no time in securing Forster's fresh corpse for their strange experimentation. The result was uncanny and amazing: only mere hours after their death, Forster was on the move again, so to speak.
As a captivated and spellbound audience looked on in near-hypnotic fashion, Aldini attached two conducting rods to a large battery. The other ends of the rods were affixed, respectively, to Forster's right ear and mouth. When the surge of electricity hit Forster's body with full force, something incredible and obscene occurred: Forster's left-eye opened wide, appearing to stare wildly and malevolently at the shocked crowds, and their jaw began to move and quiver, as if they were about to utter something awful and guttural.
If that was not enough to provoke terror in all those in attendance, when the electrified rods were attached to Forster's right arm, their hand rose and their fist clenched. There were audible gasps in the audience and more than a couple even fainted on the spot.
Aldini was not a carnival showman, however. That's to say they did not deceive their audiences into thinking that they had literally raised the dead. Certainly, they were careful to point out that the power of electricity only appeared to make the dead come back to life. Nevertheless, in later years, and hardly surprisingly, Aldini became known as a definitive, real-life Dr. Frankenstein, even though they were actually nothing of the sort.
Aldini died in 1834, at the age of seventy-two. Their reputation as an animator of the dead remains intact two centuries after their death (from which, in case you may be wondering, they did not return).
American Apparel, purveyor of shiny pants and bodysuits, has once again courted controversy with their latest ad campaign.
The full page ad that appears in UK and US editions of Vice magazine features Maks, a stunning Bangladeshi-American woman who has worked for the company since 2010, with the words “Made in Bangladesh” splashed across their naked chest.
What with the toplessness, the allusions to ethical concerns about Bangladeshi garment industry and (as is explained in their profile) Mak's decision to abandon their Islamic faith, American Apparel is out to shock. I'm torn – is the sexual and cultural exploitation occurring in this ad excusable if it's for a good cause? Does it bring to light the plight of the Bangladeshi garment worker, or does it exploit them to sell high-waisted jeans and over-priced tees?
The campaign plays to one of American Apparel's unique selling propositions – they are sweat-shop free, with all of their clothes being manufactured in their own factory in Southern California. It's an admirable fact, and one that has the company putting a focus on the environmental and social impact of clothing production – the decidedly unglamourous side to fashion that most retailers ardently avoid.
But, not content with celebrating the fact that they employ over 5000 people in their local factories (the largest sewing facility in North America, according to the company), the company goes after already marginalised Bangladeshi garment workers to make their point.
The ad explains (in the first and only time the actual clothes are mentioned) that the jeans are "manufactured by 23 skilled American workers in Downtown Los Angeles, all of whom are paid a fair wage and have access to basic benefits such as healthcare.” Obviously it is commendable that American Apparel pays their employees fairly, but directly attacking the Bangladesh garment industry as a whole is an unhelpful simplification of a complex situation.
Why pick on the workers, rather than the western fashion brands and retailers that are squeezing these developing nations for every dollar in an attempt to increase margins? The answer is not to stop manufacturing in Bangladesh – a boycott would cripple the economy and lead to mass unemployment – but to raise the standards of working conditions and provide workers with a living, not minimum, wage.
There is no denying that American Apparel are a more ethically and socially responsible option than many fast fashion retailers with murky supply chains, and that they should be able to market themselves as such. But this ad goes further, fetishising race and cultural difference to sell product.
The beautiful, half-naked Maks in their undone blue jeans is the kind of ‘Made in Bangladesh' that suits American Apparel – sexy, exotic, confident and Westernised.  They are a version of multiculturalism that they can get on board with, but hardly represents the majority of women in their native country.
American Apparel's intentions are not evil – Iris Alonzo's the brand's Creative Director says, their advertisements aim to “celebrate women, diversity, healthy body image and female empowerment.” But this advertisement does not meaningfully represent Bangladeshi or American women.
While it's not surprising that the brand has come out with yet another campaign that so pointedly objectifies women, it is worsened by their attempt to layer it with an ill-considered message about responsible manufacturing: that the answer is not to increase wages of poorly paid workers in developing nations, but instead to shift consumption to American-made products. By going after Bangladeshi workers, American Apparel attacks the symptom of the problem rather than the cause, proving that while their manufacturing philosophy may be ethically sound, their marketing strategy leaves a lot to be desired.

The B.C. Law Society has voted down a motion that would have barred graduates of Trinity Western University's new law school from practising law in B.C. because of the school's ban on gay sex.
The society benchers voted 20-6 against the motion on Friday morning in Vancouver.
“We are very pleased with this outcome,” said TWU President Bob Kuhn in statement shortly after the vote.
Trinity Western University students must sign a covenant recognizing the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman. (Trinity Western University)
“This is also an important decision for all Canadians. It says that there is room in a democratic country like Canada for a law school at a Christian university."
The B.C. government approved the creation of a private faith-based law school at the Fraser Valley's university last December.
But the provincial approval sparked outrage from gay and lesbian advocates because the Christian university has a policy against same-sex relationships.
The school's handbook says students must sign a covenant recognizing that sexual relations should be confined to marriage between a man and a woman.
The West Coast Women's Legal Education Action Fund, a non-profit organization founded in 1985 to ensure women's equality rights under the law, says it's disappointed with the decision.
LEAF had argued that a university that practises discrimination against gay or transgendered students and faculty should not be permitted to grant law degrees on an equal footing with other law schools that don't practise such discrimination.
“TWU's discriminatory policy effectively excludes LGBTQ students from access to the benefits of a legal education at the university,” said Kasari Govender, LEAF's executive director, in a written statement.
“It also requires women to cede their constitutionally protected reproductive rights, regardless of their own personal aspirations, dignity, and autonomy. These policies are contrary to the laws of Canada, which all lawyers must swear to uphold, and have no place regulating a law school in British Columbia."
Law as a high calling
The school argued the faith component would add a unique dimension to the legal education. It plans to accept 60 students to start in September 2016.
"While there are law schools at Christian universities in other parts of the world, Trinity Western will be the first in Canada. By developing legal studies within a framework of servant leadership, the TWU law program will train lawyers with a focus on community service," said the statement.
"Students will be encouraged to see the profession of law as a high calling of service, and to volunteer with local, national, and global NGO's that serve underdeveloped nations and the vulnerable."
In December, the Federation of Law Societies of Canada gave Trinity Western University preliminary approval for its law school program and said it was up to provincial law societies to decide whether to recognize degrees from the school.
The number of higher-educational institutions offering bitcoin-, blockchain- or fintech-related instruction is constantly growing. CoinFox reviews some of the most important educational initiatives.
Earlier we wrote about bitcoin's popular image, focusing on the fact that the cryptocurrency remains unknown and rather misunderstood outside of its own community. Education is one of the keys to introducing bitcoin to the general public, systematically, and even with a critical eye.
A number of top notch North American universities, such as MIT, Stanford, Princeton, and NYU have been teaching bitcoin and blockchain since 2014, while other business schools have ventured in fintech education and research just recently.
In general, bitcoin- and blockchain-oriented courses adopt one of the two approaches: either they train coders and developers, teaching the technology underlying bitcoin and blockchain and enabling students to design bitcoin- and blockchain-powered applications, or they focus on the history of money, economy, value production and consider bitcoin as one of its most recent phenomena.
However important bitcoin and blockchain education is, it is also rather expensive. Back in September Brave New Coin wrote that NYU Stern's two day course Digital Currency: Revolution in Money and Payments cost US $3,600 and a ten-week course at Stanford cost US $3,960. Most recently THE MERKLE argued that blockchain education events were “quite expensive” as “courses on blockchain education and development cost close over US $4,000.”
MOOCs
That is why bitcoin and blockchain Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained popularity among the public.
One of the most successful initiatives of that kind is the Introduction to Digital Currencies online course launched in 2013 by the University of Nicosia in Cyprus (UNIC).
Being the first free MOOC on digital currencies and the first course in UNIC's English-taught MSc in Digital Currency program, the course is led by Andreas Antonopoulos and Antonis Polemitis and covers “both a technical overview of decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, and their broader economic, legal and financial context.” Those who succeed in completing the course, get their certificates issued and signed on blockchain.
This academic year, the course started in February with sessions on history of money and the introduction to digital currencies, continued with four classes on mainstream and alternative uses of both bitcoin and blockchain, and now, in April, will focus on the relations between digital currencies, central banking, financial, regulatory and tax institutions, as well as on the role of digital currencies in the developing world, and their place in innovation. 615 students from 76 countries have registered for the course, most of them being male (89.9%) aged between 25 and 44. The completion rate of the course is 20.81%.
Apart from teaching the Introduction to Digital Currencies, Andreas Antonopoulos has written Mastering Bitcoin, a guide translated into nine languages other than English by volunteers and now freely available for downloading.
Another free cryptocurrency course, namely Princeton University's Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies is available at Coursera. Taught by Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten and Andrew Miller, the seven-week course offers a general introduction to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as well as the conceptual foundation needed “to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network.”
Princeton Bitcoin textbook, the first complete draft of which became freely available in February 2016, is among the important outcomes of the course.
The Institute for Leadership and Sustainability (IFLAS) at the University of Cumbria discusses bitcoin from the point of view of history of money and the currencies' potential for societal innovation during its MOOC Money and Society. Launched for the first time in 2015, the MOOC will be open for students again in the end of August 2016.
On-Campus Courses
On-campus bitcoin and blockchain education is spreading rapidly, as well.
To name but a few initiatives, New York University's Law School and Stern School of Business launched The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies classes back in September 2014. Duke University's Campbell Harvey taught Innovation and Cryptoventures, a course dedicated to disruptive technologies and their implication on future business models, during the spring 2015.
In addition to being the home of the Simon Fraser Bitcoin Club which advertises itself as “the public's go-to for expertise on Bitcoin in Canada, and particularly at the university level,” Simon Fraser University (SFU) is currently considering placing BTMs on campus, as well as accepting bitcoin at its bookstore and dining services. One of the higher educational institutions publicly open to the digital currency, SFU has recently hosted the renowned peer-to-peer theorist Michel Bauwens, the founder of the Foundation for Peer-to-Peer Alternatives (P2P Foundation) and the Head of Research for Commons Transition.
During their public lecture entitled From Proprietary Systems to Open Value Regimes: Collaborative Economies and Blockchain Technologies Bauwens discussed alternatives to the neoliberal economic policies, including networked forms of production which offer “a range of new, open value practices in which communities themselves decide what value is, how it is produced, and how it should be redistributed.” Bauwens paid particular attention to the blockchain technology and its potential “to unseat monopoly forms of economic valuation and market-based incentive systems.”
While Bauwens' lecture is the most recent of peer-to-peer-, blockchain- or bitcoin-related events hosted by SFU, during the summer semester of 2015 David Andolfatto, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, included bitcoin into the list of main topics covered by their Money and Banking course.
Another important cryptocurrency educational initiative is hosted by MIT Media Lab. The Digital Currency Initiative is aimed at “pushing the boundaries of knowledge around cryptocurrency and its underlying distributed ledger technology” and “clarifying the real-world impact of these technologies.”
Launched a year ago, the Digital Currency Initiative considers its area of research novel and significant. Its goals are as follows: to conduct “research and engage more students on digital currency topics that address questions about security, stability, scalability, privacy, and economics,” to convene “governments, nonprofits, and the private sector to research and test concepts that have high social impact,” and to provide “evidence-based research to support existing and future policy and standards.”
An important result of the Digital Currency Initiative launch were two courses taught during the fall semester of 2015, namely Blockchain Technologies: Decentralize all the Things and Future Commerce ~ Rebooting Markets, Money, Transactions & Security.
The first course posited as its objective to teach students “how to work with digital currencies like bitcoin” and provide “an understanding of how to use this technical skill to impact the economics, privacy, and interoperability that are driving the adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.” The second addressed bitcoin, blockchain and digital currencies in general as examples for one of its main subject areas, namely Future of Money.
Last but not least, Stanford University offered a course and an associated lab course dedicated to cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and smart contracts entitled Bitcoin and Crypto Currencies. The course, launched also in 2015, covered “the technical aspects of crypto-currencies, blockchain technologies, and distributed consensus.”
Stanford continues to offer bitcoin and blockchain instruction, most recently with its lab course Bitcoin Engineering dedicated to building bitcoin-enabled applications (January–March 2016).
Alternative platforms
Education is not restricted to a classroom or a MOOC and does not necessarily need the backing of any university.
A non-profit educational platform Khan Academy, for instance, offers a free course entitled Money, Banking and Central Banks with a large section dedicated to bitcoin.
Another example is the Coala initiative with its community of academics, lawyers, technologists and entrepreneurs whose research, policy and infrastructure-building along with so-called Blockchain Workshops can be considered informal education units.
Finally, in February 2016 an education technology writer Audrey Watters announced their new research project dedicated to blockchain's applicability to education.
“What – if anything – can blockchain offer education technology,” Watters has asked, and we at CoinFox are eager to see what the answer will be.

Black Crown began with a suitcase, a junk shop and some photographs of strangers. I spoke to writer and creator Rob Sherman about how the story behind their story, and we shared our thoughts on the world they created. Thick with disease, horror and mystery, it's also a place of occasional and unusual beauty. As well as talking about influences drawn from the aches and illnesses of life, Rob introduced me to an artist, a photographer and an author who have inspired the work in some way. Read on for many words from one of the most interesting and literary writers in games.
RPS: The creation of Black Crown is much more obviously a writer's task than a game designer's task. But do you have a history with games?
Sherman: I've played games for almost as long as I've read books. I probably started reading books when I was about four and started playing games when I was about six. Videogames have been almost as big a part of my life as literature, but what I've always been good at is writing. I've been interested in coding and design, and I do various game-like things – I'm designing a boardgame at the moment and I run a Dungeons and Dragons game.
I've tried my hand at creating various games but writing is where my main strength has always been and it was almost a coincidence that Black Crown turned out the way it has, with a game-like format. It just so happened that Random House wanted to do a project with Failbetter games and their Storynexus platform, and the way that platform works is a logic-based if/or thing, which has a lot in common with a lot of games, especially text adventures and Choose Your Own adventure books.
But, yeah, I've always played games voraciously and have written about them a lot as well. When I was in the no man's land between university and Black Crown, I applied for a lot of games writing jobs and didn't have much success, but I'm very lucky that this came along instead.
RPS: Where you aware of Failbetter and Storynexus before Random House put you in touch with them?
Sherman: No, I wasn't. Pretty much the first email regarding it was from Dan, my editor, and they said take a look at Fallen London, or Echo Bazaar as it was then. And that is an enormous, sprawling, Victorian…well, I don't know quite how to describe it. There's so much of it.
RPS: One of the interesting things that it shares with Black Crown is that it's quite hard to put a tag on it. I tried to describe Black Crown when I first came across it, and I felt uncomfortable slotting it into a genre. I think body horror is important to mention, which I think of as much more of a cinematic, or at least visual, route.
Sherman: A lot of people have talked about body horror. If you read other stuff I've written, it's certainly a concurrent theme. For me, it's not really about the horror. The reason these things are horrific is because they are about change and manipulation of the normal human form. That's something that has always interested me. The fact that you don't have to do very much to a human body to make it terrifying.
RPS: There's a wonderful line, which I'll now misquote horribly, that says something along the lines of ‘finding hair where it's not supposed to be, unattached to a form'. And that's immediately weird and unnerving. That seems to capture a great deal of what's happening to bodies in Black Crown.
Sherman: I'm pleased that you found that line. I might be wrong but I think it's a mouse-over text.
RPS: It is, yes.
Sherman: There's probably half a novel's worth of writing in those pieces (laughs). People should look at that mouse-over text because it's very important.
That modification of human form is integral. It's very easy to use that method to make something unsettling and that's the basis for most monsters, whether it's a change to the human form or an animal form. I can't really get away from my interest in it – I don't know why I'm so fascinated by that rather than anything else that a writer might be fascinated by.
But you were saying that body horror is often used visually rather than in text, and that's true. There's a more visceral and immediate reaction to the image, and I think that's why its use in art, videogames and movies has been received so well. There's an amazing Polish artist, Beksinksi, http://www.beksinski.pl/, and they probably produced five hundred or six hundred paintings in their life and I would recommend everyone go look at their work.
They were a big touchstone. But converting these ideas into text, I think we're very lucky to have such a big, expansive mongrel language to work in. As you've probably gathered from playing Black Crown, I'm quite into words and stuff (laughs). We have such wonderful vocabulary to describe all manner of things, and even though some of it is technical and not in peoples' everyday vocabulary, there's an almost onomatopoeic quality to a lot of it.
RPS: One of the things that strikes me, and it sounds very wishy-washy, is that there's a texture to the writing. It feels alternately greasy and abrasive. But I should say, it's not all horror and grime. One of the most memorable moments I've encountered is a love affair with a mop, which I felt could have gone a different way if I'd chosen to be repulsed by what was happening.
Sherman: Somebody sent a report of a typo and I asked exactly where it was in the story. And the guy said, “I'll never write this sentence again, but it's the sequence with the dancing mop.” Because of the way that Black Crown has been written…and I don't know how much you know about how it all started.
RPS: I've heard the story from Failbetter but if you could tell it here, that would be great. I just call it the suitcase story.
Sherman: It started at university, with an experimental fiction module. I'd been exposed to a lot of very interesting things with that module, such as OULIPO (link in French – wikipedia link here). We were given an exercise in class in which we were given photographs from a guy called August Sander, who was a German photographer who almost exclusively took portraits of people in their everyday dress, or their workclothes. They are black and white, very beautiful photographs, and we were told that we had to write a story to fit with these photographs, which is a very standard university creative writing task.
In the end, I came up with a caption for each photograph, but they didn't describe the person, but described a piece of scenery. So there'd be a picture of an old man and I'd describe a ruined ship, or a wood with no people in it. And I quite liked the effect, so eventually I turned that into a piece of work that I called Landscapes, with forty or fifty of those photos and captions that described a single place. And that place became a mountain town where it seemed like everybody had disappeared at once, and there was evidence of strange practices. It was a little bit like Innsmouth from Lovecraft – not necessarily demonic or evil practices. Just strange.
Time went on and I was nearly at the end of my Masters and I had to come up with a final piece, and I thought ‘what the hell am I going to do'. And I came across Landscapes and thought, well, why don't I tell the story of how this place became abandoned. That's an unsolved mystery so I should concentrate on that. I honestly can't remember how or when I thought about doing it in the way I did, but I decided not to do it with just a sheet of paper, but with objects. Highly experimental and hodge-podge, which at university you can do! Especially in the liberal arts.
I lived very near a junk shop – it's mean to use the word ‘junk' actually, because there's a lot of beautiful stuff in there. But the American lady who runs it now has a programme on Sky Atlantic called Junk Hunters. They were quite the character. I took the last of my student loan and I went down there and started buying up stuff. The shop had an incredible turnover. The stock would completely sell out every week and on Sunday they would restock it.
It took three or four weeks to get everything together, but I started off with a suitcase, and I thought, well this must belong to a traveller. So these must be the possessions of somebody who has come to this place, and I started to become interested in anthropology and the history of anthropology, and how somebody coming to a new culture would act around it is and write about it. I roped in a few friends, we recorded some music, we took some photographs. I presented the suitcase full of objects, which told the story of the Miasma Eremite, this person – well, you're not really sure what they were – and how they interacted with the town and fell in love with a girl, who at that time was called Death of a Friend. The story tells how their actions caused the town to be destroyed.
The Widsith Institute at that time was a very loose device to allow me to present these things to my tutor. The fiction was that my tutor received the suitcase in the post with a letter from the Institute asking them to tell them what they thought about the case. In the end, it turned out that they had been blackmailed by the Widsith Institute and they had infected them with a disease, and the last chapter was a CD hidden in the lining of the casing which said “if you have opened the sealed package that has the Eremite's
RPS: When you first encounter something in a specific medium, it's sometimes hard to imagine it in another, which is one of the reasons people can be so sniffy about adaptations, I guess. But Black Crown does suit the form that it's in. The first time I reached the Parlour, when you're removed from your desk and any kind of outside space, the claustrophobia was effectively communicated on the screen and by the layout of the text. The sense that the narrative is cut-up and that I don't know if I should have ended up there more effectively communicated dread than the turn of a page.
Sherman: I think the story that ended up being told – and this goes back to the previous question that I'd forgotten – the Widsnith Institute was originally this little tacked on excuse, or MacGuffin really, for the story about the town that I wanted to tell. That's been flipped around and now the story of the town is more incidental to the story of the Institute. The story was not cemented in place when I began and to be honest I didn't know what the Institute was until about a month before launch. There was no hill, there were no suits. I was lucky that it all came together in the end.
You take a central image that is bizarre, like the dancing mop, but there needs to be a reason for it to be there. When you go back you find links that can make sense of it. Sorry – that's something of an aside!
RPS: Speaking of bizarre images, I only just registered that the front page of the Black Crown site has an image of the people at their desks, with the suits. It's a very literal depiction.
Sherman: That's a very recent addition.
RPS: I went back in to play today and I saw that and realised that it now feels more like a real place to me rather than just a hallucination or a delirium. I'm never sure of the physicality of things in the game but the image made it seem more possible. A great deal of the game has what I'm going to regret calling, “the tangible quality of dreams”. It feels very unreal but so much of it is very intentionally physical.
Sherman: I hate writing dreams. Part of that is because I feel it's a cop out. It's a way to put in anything you want with no justification except that it's a dream. Also, I don't dream very much. I have very peaceful normal night sleep. I rarely have nightmares or even memorable dreams.
But it's a really good point. The unreality has physicality that anchors it. The player sees something bizarre, beautiful or ugly, and it's like a spectacle in front of them. But then something happens to their character, a physical reaction, and that thing, that sensation, is something that has happened to the player in their life. It's why illness is such a good touchstone. Pretty much everything that's being described in the project – and I know there are very weird diseases in there – but they all have roots in real illnesses and real causes of harm. Everyone knows what it feels like to get poked in the eye, or to have an itch, or moles, or spots on their arse. Everybody knows how those things feel and so that's intensely relatable. It's a grounding mechanism, entirely unintentional at my point at the start, is now becoming how people keep a handle on this weird content.
A lot of players have said ‘I don't really understand what's going on'. And that's fair enough but I do think that some of those players are rushing through, clicking through too fast, and that's why I'm quite uncomfortable describing it as a game. A game has systems, and they're sometimes opaque, but they're usually learnable by a player and exploitable by a player. There is some sort of strategy involved.
Black Crown is not really about strategy. There isn't a way to game it. If anybody tries to, they'll be disappointed. Despite that, the format completely suits the narrative. People ask if it's like a tree with lots of branching things and it isn't. I'd have gone mad a long time ago if I'd had to deal with the exponential increase in content that would cause. It's much more like a river. I suppose that every narrative is in a sense because it takes you along a course but the thing with Black Crown's format is that you can slow down, get stuck on things, take detours, but you'll always come back to the main flow. There's an inevitability to the story but you can miss things.
There's an excellent short story by a guy called Victor Pelevin, a Russian writer, and it seems to be about a man talking about their girlfriend who gets run over by a car. The last three words reveal that it's actually their cat, not a girlfriend. If you read through it again, you realise that there are so many hints and that if you'd paid attention to all of them, you might have got it.
I feel that that's what Black Crown is doing in an expanded way. It's telling you who your character is, why you're at the Institute, who all of these people are, these strange characters. There's a reason for them to be there. They're not just weird wallpaper and I think that puts people off at times, that it's just weirdness for its own sake. All will be revealed though. Well, some of it (laughs).
The format of this, and I don't think it's a game, does work for the mystery I'm trying to evoke.
In part two, I argue that Black Crown is a game and we discuss how it benefits from the interactivity and pacing of the StoryNexus platform, as well as digging into more detail about the horror of it all. Register and play Black Crown for free here.
Vince Cable to run for Liberal Democrat leader. Leon Neal/Getty Images
LONDON — Sir Vince Cable has announced their bid to become the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.
The former Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills announced their intention to succeed outgoing leader Tim Farron on Tuesday morning, shortly after Business Insider revealed their bid in an exclusive piece.
Farron announced that they would be stepping down as Lib Dem leader last week after facing weeks of tough questioning during the general election campaign about their views on homosexuality as a devout Christian.
The MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale — who was elected the party's leader in July 2015 — said in a statement that it felt "impossible" to continue as leader of the Liberal Democrats and live "as a faithful Christian".
Since that announcement, a number of Lib Dem figures have been touted as potential successors, with bookmakers leaning heavily in favour of Cable, MP for East Dunbartonshire Jo Swinson, and North Norfolk MP Norman Lamb.
A well-placed source within the Lib Dems told Business Insider last week that Cable's experience made them the most obvious choice to succeed Farron, despite speculation that Swinson was the preferred choice among party members.
Swinson announced over the weekend that they intend to run for deputy leader, not leader, and at around 11:00 (BST) Cable released a statement confirming their desire to be elected the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.
Cable said: "Today I am announcing that I will be a candidate in the forthcoming Liberal Democrat leadership election. I wanted to do so on Lib Dem Voice, the leading forum for discussion amongst our membership.
"With 20 years on the national political stage, I am passionate as ever about our liberal values. I am ready to commit my energy, enthusiasm and experience to the task of leading the Liberal Democrats through what will be a period of chronic uncertainty. With the prospect of another election looming large, we must be ready for the fight."
They added: "There are big opportunities ahead. The Conservatives are in disarray and retreat. The Labour Party outperformed expectations but complacently believes that 'one more heave' will see it into office. But an economic policy based on offering lots of free things lacks economic credibility and will be found out. Investing in infrastructure, rather than borrowing for everyday running costs is credible. There is a big space in British politics which I am determined that we should occupy."
Interestingly, Cable refused to confirm they would lead the Lib Dems into a 2022 general election if elected leader in an interview with Sky on Tuesday afternoon. The MP — who will be aged 79 in five years time — said it's possible that he'd hand the job over to one of their "younger" colleagues. A Lib Dem source told us last week that one idea currently being floated is Cable serving as interim leader before stepping down to make way for the much younger Swinson before 2022.
The original plan was for Cable to launch their bid on Monday but the announcement was delayed until today due to the terrorist attack on Finsbury Park Mosque in north London in the early hours of Monday morning.
Cable, 74, has dropped not-so-subtle hints that they plan to launch a leadership bid. They said they hadn't "ruled anything out" in an interview with the Independent last week, and has refused to shoot down rumours of a bid.
Vince Cable with Tim Farron. Jack Taylor / Getty The newly re-elected MP for Twickenham boasts a wealth of political experience and is regarded as a figure who will bring a period of stability to the party as it prepares for life after the contentious exit of its current leader Farron.
They served as the Twickenham MP from 1997 until 2015 before winning the seat back the London seat from the Tories in this month's election. They were appointed a cabinet minister during the David Cameron-led coalition government and has served both as acting and deputy leader of the Lib Dems. They were also knighted in 2015.
 They are not believed to have been involved in what allies of Farron described as the "coup" against him. "Funnily enough, I think this is the first coup that they haven't actually been involved with," one well-placed party source told BI.
The Liberal Democrats hope a new leader will be in place before the party meets up for its Autumn conference in Bournemouth on September 16. The new leader will be chosen by the party's 100,000+ membership via a one member-one vote system. Cable is likely to go head to head with Sir Ed Davey and Norman Lamb for the top job.
So yeah, that's what I look like, in case you ever wondered how accurate those drawn comics were. The second to last panel is my usual face when the Giants have 2 minutes left to play and are winning. I do indeed only wear an Eli jersey. It's mostly because I don't own anything not Giants related.
If you're from Portland, you might recognize Forest Park, where I literally found an empty spot during the day yesterday and took selfies of myself acting weird (side note, taking selfies with a DSLR is difficult). I even left a confusing message for anyone who happens to wander Firelane 7 this weekend. I'm glad nobody came along because that would have been weird.
“Um what are you doing”
“I'm…taking pictures of myself, for a comic”
*Concerned stare* “Come on Timmy let's get away from the weird man”
Also I got home, put this together, and photoshopped Matt Forte in and was about to save it out when I remembered Forte is no longer a Bear and it made me sad. Then I put Martellus Bennett in but they are a Pat now and I was even sadder. I realized there is like nobody on the Bears I know any more besides Cutler and Jeffrey. Kyle Long, I guess. Robbie Gould! I can't use Robbie Gould because nobody would be scared of Robbie Gould in the woods. Oh, wait, Peanut Tilma…damnit. Lance Briggs? aw man. WAIT, WAIT! That one guy! the CB! Kyle Fuller! YEAH. GOT ONE.
It's kind of weird how the Bears have sort of vanished. The team that was sometimes good and at least usually relevant for the past decade is now almost unrecognizable. It's Cutler and Jeffrey, then a bunch of nobodies. I have Bears fans in my family and I've always had a soft spot for them but I bearly (Yeah I said it) even acknowledged their existence last season. The only time I even thought about the Bears was when they embarrassed the Packers on Favre night, which owned. I don't think I'm alone. I think in general the now lack of names on the Bears has left them weirdly ignored for a major market, kind of like what happened to the Vikings for a while. I hope Da Bears come back to prominence. I root for Cutler because Chicago doesn't appreciate them enough and the league is a better place when the Bears are relevant.
Edit: Thank you to everyone who has supported the Draw Play Patreon as well. I just purchased my new Tablet, and I should have it in my hands by Tuesday, which means we should be back to regular comics by next Thursday

A Las Vegas man who may be linked to the federal investigation involving rancher Cliven Bundy pleaded guilty Wednesday to threatening the life of President Barack Obama and other government officials.
Tyrone Paul Ponthieux, 55, pleaded guilty to one felony count of making threats against the president in November 2014 and one count of threats against federal officials, including an FBI agent, in September.
Ponthieux, who is to be sentenced July 20, was ordered released from federal custody with conditions, including home detention and electronic monitoring.
Federal prosecutors and defense lawyers are keeping a lid on Ponthieux's possible ties to the Bundy investigation, which stems from the April 2014-armed standoff with law enforcement near Bundy's ranch in Bunkerville.
Ponthieux has agreed to cooperate and provide testimony about “other persons who are committing or have committed offenses against the United States,” according to their 20-page plea agreement. In return, prosecutors will seek a lighter sentence for him.
The Bundy investigation is not named in the plea agreement, but the same prosecutors in that case, including First Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Myhre, appeared in court Wednesday for Ponthieux's change of plea.
Agents with the Las Vegas FBI's domestic terrorism squad, which investigated the Bunkerville showdown, are also involved in the Ponthieux case.
Agents learned that Ponthieux had made a death threat on their Facebook page in November 2014 against Obama and members of Congress, an FBI criminal complaint alleges. The Facebook page contains a photo of Ponthieux sitting on a black Hummer holding an AR-15 rifle.
“I think we all need to get our guns and shoot all these out of control members of congress and senators and Obama!” the threat said. “Any survivors, hang them, then try their dead bodies for high treason!”
The complaint alleges FBI agents discovered the threat “during the course of conducting open source Internet searches related to another investigation.”
While in federal custody, Ponthieux later threatened other officials, including an FBI agent assigned to investigate him, their plea agreement states.
Their lawyer, William Gamage, declined comment Wednesday.
Bundy and four of their sons, all of whom are in federal custody, are among 19 defendants facing criminal charges tied to the Bunkerville confrontation.

The CERN Data Centre has been upgraded to process the huge amounts of data generated by collisions during Run 2 of the LHC, which starts this week
This week, the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will start taking data at the new energy frontier of 13 teraelectonvolts (TeV) - nearly double the energy of collisions in the LHC's first three-year run. These collisions, which will occur up to 1 billion times every second, will send showers of particles through the detectors.
With every second of run-time, gigabytes of data will come pouring into the CERN Data Centre to be stored, sorted and shared with physicists worldwide. To cope with this massive influx of Run 2 data, the CERN computing teams focused on three areas: speed, capacity and reliability.
"During Run 1, we were storing 1 gigabyte-per-second, with the occasional peak of 6 gigabytes-per-second," says Alberto Pace, who leads the Data and Storage Services group within the IT Department. "For Run 2, what was once our "peak" will now be considered average, and we believe we could even go up to 10 gigabytes-per-second if needed."
At CERN, most of the data is archived on magnetic tape using the CERN Advanced Storage system (CASTOR) and the rest is stored on the EOS disk pool system – a system optimized for fast analysis access by many concurrent users. Magnetic tapes may be seen as an old-fashioned technology. They are actually a robust storage material, able to store huge volumes of data and thus ideal for long-term preservation. The computing teams have improved the software of the tape storage system CASTOR, allowing CERN's tape drives and libraries to be used more efficiently, with no lag times or delays. This allows the Data Centre to increase the rate of data that can be moved to tape and read back.
Reducing the risk of data loss - and the massive storage burden associated with this - was another challenge to address for Run 2. The computing teams introduced a data 'chunking' option in the EOS storage disk system. This splits the data into segments and enables recently acquired data to be kept on disk for quick access. "This allowed our online total data capacity to be increased significantly," Pace continues. "We have 140 petabytes of raw disk space available for Run 2 data, divided between the CERN Data Centre and the Wigner Data Centre in Budapest, Hungary. This translates to about 60 petabytes of storage, including back-up files."
140 petabytes (which is equal to 140 million gigabytes) is a very large number indeed - equivalent to over a millenium of full HD-quality movies.
Now, in addition to the regular "replication" approach - whereby a duplicated copy is kept for all data - experiments will now have an option to scatter the data across multiple disks. This "chunking" approach breaks the data into pieces. Use of reconstruction algorithms means that content will not be lost even if multiple disks fail. This not only decreases the probability of data loss, but also cuts in half the space needed for back-up storage. Finally, the EOS system has also been further improved to achieve the goal of more than 99.5% availability for the duration of Run 2.
From quicker storage speeds to new storage solutions, CERN is well-prepared for all of the fantastic challenges of Run 2.
Godfrey Cheshire on Knowing Abbas Kiarostami Through Their Films and Friendship July 5, 2016 |
Among the memories of Abbas Kiarostami that have come flooding to mind today:
One day in the late ‘90s when I visited them at their home in north Tehran, they told me they wanted to give me a present before I left Iran. They knew I greatly admired their still photographs and said they wanted to offer me a print of one. They asked me to choose it.
As we sat across a card table from each other, they held a stack of maybe 75 large prints, showing each one for maybe 15 seconds before lowering it to reveal the next. They kept their eyes on me. Though I was intently interested in everything they were showing me, I don't recall revealing any particular feelings. At the end of the display, I told them which photo I liked best. They smiled and seemed pleased.

When I came back to their house a few days later, they said they had to apologize. The negative of the photo I'd chosen had been damaged in the lab, so they couldn't give me that one. But they had another print, they said—of the photo I liked second best. They were right. The print they gave me was just that. They knew it was my second favorite from having watched my face and somehow registered the tiny flickers of emotion they saw there.
That print is framed and is on the wall of my living room now.
I recall this episode because it captures several things that are central to my memories of him: the extraordinary visual acuity that characterizes both their photographs and their films; their sometimes almost uncanny sensitivity to other people; and their mixture of dry wit and unaffected generosity toward those lucky enough to become their friends.
I first encountered their work in the autumn of 1992 when Film Comment asked me to attend the first festival of post-revolutionary Iranian films held at Lincoln Center, to see if it was worth an article. Since I'd heard nothing of the recent cinematic brilliance from Iran that had begun seeping into world film festivals, I was amazed at what I saw there: an array of highly distinctive auteurs, and one fascinating film after another. But the filmmaker and film that captivated me most were Abbas Kiarostami and “Close-Up,” their 1990 meta-cinematic masterpiece about a poor man arrested for impersonating a famous film director. I started my Film Comment article discussing the landmark film, and have written about it countless times since (including for Criterion's DVD release).
“Close-Up” was a turning point for Kiarostami. Prior to Iran's 1979 Revolution, they had spent a decade heading up the filmmaking division of Iran's Center for the Intellectual Development for Children and Young Adults, where they made a number of striking shorts and pioneered what I later called a distinctive Iranian genre: the child-centered film, which, as Kiarostami conceived it, was a form “about, but not necessarily for, children.” They also made two notable features, “The Traveler” and “The Report,” during this period.

Come the Revolution, he, like many Iranian filmmakers, hunkered down and waited for the storm to pass. When authorities of the Islamic Republic decided to revive the cinema in the mid-80s (the Ayatollah Khomeini had hailed its potential for moral education), Kiarostami was among the filmmakers invited to resume making features. Their first under the new regime, “Where Is the Friend's House?,” was a spare, witty, poetically resonant tale of a boy trying to find a schoolmate's home; it helped launch the child-centered film's hugely successful post-revolutionary career, which included the Iranian cinema's first major international prize, the 1995 Camera d'or at Cannes for “The White Balloon,” scripted by Kiarostami and directed by their former assistant, Jafar Panahi.
But “Close-Up” was the film that broke the mold—or rather added a new one, a kind of self-reflexive film that meditated on film and filmmakers and blurred the lines between fiction and non-fiction, life and art. It was this heady blend that led critics like myself to see in Iran, of all places, a kind of cinematic sophistication that surpassed that of most film cultures in other parts of the world. Although “Close-Up” was passed over by the world's top festivals, its mounting critical renown got Kiarostami on the radar of Cannes' programmers, and they were canny enough to subsequently turn out two more films-about-film, “And Life Goes On” (1992) and “Through the Olive Trees” (1994), that put them among Cannes' leading contenders while also solidifying their global critical reputation.
When I first visited Iran in the mid-90s, I found that this very success had cast a pall of suspicion around Kiarostami. I was repeatedly told that Iranian cinephiles and critics didn't regard them as their best director. Why were Westerners elevating them above other great filmmakers? Was this some kind of cultural conspiracy (Iranians are big on conspiracies) aimed at God-knows-what end? I tried to explain that festivals like Cannes are in the auteur-making business, and they only wanted one from Iran at the moment. It was not a matter of art, as perhaps it should have been, but of festival brand-building.

Looking back, I have even more admiration for what Kiarostami did next. They could have made another wry, humanistic, self-reflexive film like “Through the Olive Trees” and boosted their popularity even further among festival mavens. But when I saw them in Tehran in early '97, I could sense they were after something radically different. They seemed very pressured and it was said the government was making their working conditions rough. Not long after, we learned why: their new film was about suicide, which is taboo under Islam. The battle over whether the film (which they reportedly modified with a new, more lyrical ending) would be permitted to go to Cannes reached the very top levels of the Iranian government, and lasted until the last minute. When I got on the plane for Cannes (after writing a report for Variety that was used to bolster Kiasotami's position in Iran), it was still unclear whether the film would be released.
What followed was, of course, a famously dramatic piece of cinema history: “Taste of Cherry,” a very bleak but also mysterious film about an apparently well-off man's spiral toward self-erasure, swept into Cannes and became the first Iranian film to win the Palme d'or. Yet while it drew hosannahs from the French especially, it was not universally loved by critics. The post-screening debate between Roger Ebert (con) and Jonathan Rosenbaum and Dave Kehr (pro) remains part of the film's lore.
I'm pretty sure I didn't participate in any of those discussions for a simple reason: I didn't entirely know what to make of “Taste of Cherry,” to begin with. And this marked a turning point in my relationship with the director's work. Before, having been writing about their films and studying them for several years, I felt like I knew what they were about as an artist. But beginning with “Taste of Cherry,” each new film confounded my expectations. It took days, weeks, months or even years to process and finally get a fix on the latest Kiarostami, to feel I had a grasp on what it was about that at least satisfied me. “Close-Up” was multi-layered in its meanings, but I felt I got it on first look. “Taste of Cherry” and “The Wind Will Carry Us” (2000), on the other hand, I came to regard as masterworks equal to that film, but on initial viewings they befuddled me—and demanded that I revamp my understanding of Kiarostami yet again.
For critics, who are increasingly pressed to deliver cogent judgments within an hour or two of seeing a film, such bafflements are as valuable as they are awkward. What if the greatest artists ultimately are the ones who require time, patience, thought, and perhaps above all, an awareness that views their work as an organically evolving whole rather than one consumerist nugget after another? That's certainly one way of describing Kiarostami's greatness. They were an artist who never rested in whatever parameters were used to define him, but kept on challenging himself, pushing the boundaries that the world, the authorities, critics, admirers and even they themselves had set around him.

In the West, such an attitude may require a certain amount of daring vis a vis one's career, but in Iran it requires genuine courage, incredible stamina and steadfast determination. Though Kiarostami did make their last two features outside Iran, they always regarded their art firmly rooted in Iranian culture; though thoroughly cosmopolitan, they never considered becoming an expatriate. Throughout their career, they walked a very tricky tightrope in their relationship with the government and their triumph was that they survived.
From the time Kiarostami's ascent at Cannes began, they increasingly came to be seen as some kind of “world” auteur and their work understood in terms of Western modernism and its aftermath. But the great luck I had in encountering that work was that it also entailed spending a fair amount of time in Iran, so that instead of seeing them mainly in relation to Godard, Bergman and Tarkovky, say, I pondered their connections to classical Persian artists such as Omar Khayyam, Rumi and Hafez well as Iranian moderns such as Sohrab Sepheri and Forugh Farrokhzad. Persian culture is still a vast terra incognita to most Westerners, and discovering it is a life-changing adventure that I continue to urge on anyone searching for the deepest layers and implications of Kiarostami's work.
After “Taste of Cherry” won at Cannes, I followed Kiarostami to Iran and spent most of the summer there, a good part of it with him. They were continually generous in sitting in front a tape recorder with me, and one day offered to drive me to the distant rural area where the Koker Trilogy (“Where Is the Friend's House?” “And Life Goes On” and “Through the Olive Trees”) was filmed. The place was a bucolic village until it was destroyed by an earthquake, which shrouds the trilogy's second and third films in reminders of mortality. But that hardly makes the works morbid: quite the contrary, in fact. Kiarostami's films so often seem to balance on the knife's edge between existence and its opposite, but always implicitly end up siding with lucidity and life. Just as they gazed at me with such precise comprehension as I looked at their photos, so do their films gaze at the world. That day in the remains of Koker, they beheld ruin but looked as happy, alive and bemused as I've ever seen anyone. That life will remain in their films, as a poetic and philosophic testament, as long as the medium remembers its masters.

Byron burgers get dozens of its own employees deported.
On the 4th of July, workers across 15 Byron restaurants were called in for a training at 9.30. 5 minutes after start, 2 immigration enforcement officers for the Home Office arrived, carrying lists of names and photos. They started calling people into a room one by one.
A manager in Byron unashamedly explained ‘We know what's going on here. We prepared this.' Dozens of workers were arrested, and deported that same name. Most of them were Latin American. Here's what Byron said when contacted by El Iberico: “Byron confirms that several of our London restaurants were visited by representatives of the Interior Ministry earlier this week . The Interior Ministry recognizes that Byron, as an employer, meets the requirements of immigration law in their procedure for hiring workers. In Byron we are proud of the diversity in the staff of our restaurants built around people of all backgrounds. We have a long and close collaboration with the Ministry of Interior , to cooperate fully with them throughout the course of the investigations currently carried out and that will be in the future. “ A quick search on the internet tells me that no other media outlet is talking about that. Let's change that.
The above is one of the few write ups I could find of a recent immigration bust on Byron Burgers. There's a Spanish language report over at El Iberico too. I know this is a bit out of the usual and I'm not planning to make too much of a habit of posting random news items but this seems to have been ignored in most places so I figured I'd throw it out there.
Why does it matter? Because in working with a business that illegally employed undocumented workers the Immigration authorities have thrown the weight of guilt directly onto workers. It tells business that they can get away with breaking immigration law as long as they're willing to throw up a few scapegoats if they get caught out. And it tells workers that their bosses are willing and now able to barter them away to avoid any repercussions they should be facing. It does nothing to stop dodgy practices, but it does make those workers even more easily exploitable. At the same time it gives politicians and the authorities an easy way to look ‘tough' on illegal immigration without undermining the cheap labour market that their peers in business increasingly rely on.
It's an example which extends beyond employment too – landlords for example have been known to use the threat of deportation to coerce or force poor conditions on tenants. Again, shifting all responsibility to the individuals who're just living their lives while removing all responsibility from those profiting from it.
Sadly there's no doubt going to be more stuff like this coming out as Theresa May looks for stories to re-enforce their ‘tough' position on immigration.
Update: Full translation of the El Iberico piece below, not done by me but credit to whoever did it. Drop me a line with your name and I'll add it.
Recently, I have been studying comparative constitutional law. It is a fascinating area, providing real world examples for the issues that constitutional theory explores. What is more, the practices of other constitutional judiciaries are often unexpected. I often find myself saying, “do they really do that?”
One example is the recent constitutional case, decided by the Supreme Court of India, finding that the Indian Constitution provides a nontextual right to privacy. The Supreme Court of India is one of the most aggressive high courts in the world. Perhaps its most aggressive action has been a series of cases where the court held that the basic structure of the Indian Constitution could not be amended, even though the constitution did not textually provide for that and in fact seemed to suggest otherwise.
The recent case finding a privacy right, Justice K S Puttaswamy V. Union Of India, is remarkable in many ways. The opinion is over 500 pages long! And it engages in a discussion of various issues one would not expect.
To begin with the decision addresses originalism. It has a section entitled “Constituent Assembly and Privacy: Limits of Originalist Interpretation,” that purports to address the originalist objections.
In another section, the court explored philosophical and legal theory aspects of privacy. Thus, it discusses the views in separate subsections of Judith Jarvis Thompson, Richard Posner, Robert Bork, and Catherine MacKinnon. It is interesting that while the U.S. Supreme Court largely ignores foreign court decisions and foreign legal scholars, the Indian Supreme Court devotes so much space to these matters.
A Supreme Court decision in the United States would not do this. One does not see long discussions of why originalism does not apply in the U.S. And one certainly does not see significant discussions of the views of legal theorists.
The decision also appeared to overrule two prior decisions that refused to recognize a privacy right. (Here, of course, the Indian Supreme Court does not represent a radical break with the practice of the U.S. Supreme Court.)
As it is characteristic of the decisions of the aggressive high courts throughout the world, the announced right is not absolute or even determinate. The privacy right “will have some reasonable restrictions in matters of national security and mutual interest of the citizens and the state.” While this limitation might seem to lessen the effect of the court's decision, it nonetheless allows the court more power to determine the content of the right, at its discretion.
Decisions like these are sobering. It is almost enough to make one appreciate Justices Kennedy or Sotomayor.
After years of saying habitable exoplanets are just around the corner, planet hunters have finally found one. Gliese 581g is the first planet found to lie squarely in its star's habitable zone, where the conditions are right for liquid water.
"The threshold has now been crossed," said astronomer R. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, one of the planet's discoverers, in a press briefing Sept. 29. "The data says this planet is at the right distance for liquid water, and the right mass to hold on to a substantial atmosphere."
The discovery is both "incremental and monumental," comments exoplanet expert Sara Seager of MIT, who was not involved in the new study. When a recent study predicted the first habitable world should show up by next May, Seager rightly said the real answer was more like "any day now."
"We've found smaller and smaller planets that got closer and closer to the habitable zone," they said. "But this is the first that's in the habitable zone."
The new planet is one of six orbiting the star Gliese 581, a red dwarf 20 light-years from Earth. Two of the planet's siblings, dubbed planets C and D, have also been hailed as potentially habitable worlds. The two planets straddle the region around the star where liquid water could exist – 581c is too hot, and 581d is too cold. But 581g is just right. The discovery will be published in the Astrophysical Journal and online at arxiv.org.
The new planet is about three times the mass of Earth, which indicates it is probably rocky and has enough surface gravity to sustain a stable atmosphere. It orbits its star once every 36.6 Earth days at a distance of just 13 million miles.
The surface of a planet that close to our sun would be scorching hot. But because the star Gliese 581 is only about 1 percent as bright as the sun, temperatures on the new planet should be much more comfortable. Taking into account the presence of an atmosphere and how much starlight the planet probably reflects, astronomers calculated the average temperature ranges from minus 24 degrees to 10 degrees above zero Fahrenheit.
But the actual temperature range is even wider, says astronomer Steven Vogt of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who designed some of the instruments that helped find the planet. Gravity dictates that such a close-in planet would keep the same side facing the star at all times, the same way the moon always shows the same face to Earth.
That means the planet has a blazing-hot daytime side, a frigid nighttime side, and a band of eternal sunrise or sunset where water – and perhaps life – could subsist comfortably. Any life on this exotic world would be confined to this perpetual twilight zone, Vogt says, but there's room for a lot of diversity.
"You can get any temperature you want on this planet, you just have to move around on its surface," Vogt said. "There's a great range of eco-longitudes that will create a lot of different niches for different kinds of life to evolve stably."
Another advantage for potential life on Gliese 581g is that its star is "effectively immortal," Butler said. "Our sun will go 10 billion years before it goes nova, and life here ceases to exist. But M dwarfs live for tens, hundreds of billions of years, many times the current age of the universe. So life has a long time to get a toehold."
The discovery is based on 11 years of observations using the HIRES spectrometer at the Keck Telescope in Hawaii, combined with data from the HARPS (High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher) instrument at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile.
Both instruments look for the small wobbles stars make as their planets' gravity tugs them back and forth. The HIRES project started looking for planets 25 years ago, back "when looking for planets made you look like a nut," Butler said. At first the instruments could detect changes in a star's velocity that were 300 meters per second or larger. That's why the first extrasolar planets discovered were almost exclusively hot Jupiters: These monstrous planets that sit roastingly close to their stars will exert a bigger gravitational pull.
Since then, techniques have improved so that changes as small as 3 meters per second can be seen. That wouldn't be enough to see Earth from 20 light-years away, Butler says. Because red dwarfs are so small and their habitable zones so close, though, Earth-sized planets have enough gravitational oomph to make a difference.
"The excitement here is that by looking at stars that are small it's much easier to find small planets," said exoplanet expert David Charbonneau of Harvard, who is hunting for small planets that cross in front of dwarf stars. "I think it's great news for those of us looking for this kind of thing around this kind of star."
But finding them takes a long time. In all, 238 measurements of the star's wobbles, went into the discovery, and each measurement took a full night of observing.
For Butler and Vogt, though, 11 years wasn't so long to wait. He's actually surprised that a potentially habitable planet showed up so quickly and so nearby.
"The fact that we found one so close and so early on in the search suggests there are a lot of these things," Butler says. Only about 100 other stars are as close to Earth as Gliese 581, and only 9 of them have been closely examined for planets. Odds are good that 10 to 20 percent of stars in the Milky Way have habitable planets, Vogt says.
Finding them won't take a huge advance in technology, they add. It will just take more telescope time.
"I have suggested that we build a dedicated automated planet finder to do this kind of work 365 nights a year," they said. "If we had something equivalent to Keck that we could use every night, these things would be pouring out of the sky."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Ukrainian immigrant who underwent amputations after a Philadelphia building collapsed on them was awarded $95.6 million as part of a settlement for victims of the 2013 disaster that killed seven people and injured 12 others, their attorney said on Friday.
An arbitrator responsible for dividing between victims the $227 million personal injury settlement reached in February assigned 55-year-old Mariya Plekan the biggest piece of the sum, attorney Andrew Stern said.
Plekan was shopping in a Salvation Army on June 5, 2013, when the one-story thrift store was struck by debris from a vacant neighboring building that collapsed while being demolished.
Surgeons removed Plekan's legs and lower torso in a series of operations after they were rescued from the rubble, which they were stuck under for 13 hours.
Plekan also suffered lung and kidney problems from breathing in toxic materials while trapped, Stern said. They recently lost their ability to speak due to throat damage from the use of a breathing tube.
The settlement funds will allow Plekan, who will require constant medial care for the rest of their life, to achieve their goal of moving out of a nursing home to live with their children, Stern said.
“We're just so happy for them in this regard,” they said. “It has been a long road.”
In January, a jury found the Salvation Army and developer Richard Basciano, who had hired the company that improperly demolished the neighboring building, financially liable for the collapse.
The contractor, Griffin Campbell, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced in January 2016 to 15 to 30 years in prison for their role in the collapse.
The only other person to face criminal charges stemming from the incident, excavator operator Sean Benschop, was sentenced to 7-1/2 to 15 years in prison.
A 52-year-old city inspector, who was tasked with checking the building under demolition, committed suicide a week after the collapse.
U.S. Bank Settles Class Action Lawsuit Regarding Overdraft Fees
Sponsored links
On September 14, 2014, disbursement of a $55 million dollar settlement began arriving in the accounts of affected U.S. Bank customers. Twelve U.S. Bank customers filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves and other customers affected by the fee-gathering practices of U.S. Bank. Specifically, the customers were suing over the bank's practice of intentionally processing debit card transactions in order from highest to lowest dollar amount in order to maximize overdraft fees charged to customers whose accounts held insufficient funds. U.S. Bank continues to claim they did nothing wrong by processing transactions in this manner. Settlement money will continue to arrive in the accounts of affected customers through the 29th of September. Those customers who have questions will be directed to the U.S. Bank Overdraft Settlement Support Website.

Reordering Transactions
U.S. Bank is not the only bank who has taken part in what should be a blatantly underhanded practice of reordering debit card transactions to create overdraft fees which would not have existed otherwise. A June 2013 article by Forbes.com writer Halah Touryalai describes in detail how this process can unfairly increase costs to consumers. This specific behavior is often justified with a statement that banks are not nonprofits, thus a customer should not expect to receive their services for free. This sentiment was expressed by Sandy McCraren, president of a community bank in Highland Park, Illinois, in a June 2013 article by Marcie Geffner of Bankrate.com. While defending bank fees universally, McCraren also stated that while “we would love to be able to give everything free, we can't…” Judging from the settlement paid out by U.S. Bank and the investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this condescending excuse of an excuse for charging excessive fees is not going to hold water moving forward.
Investigation of Overdraft Fee Practices
In February of 2012, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency of the United States Government charged with enforcing federal consumer financial laws, launched an investigation into the practice of charging overdraft fees to bank customers. Specific concerns cited included transaction re-ordering which increases costs to consumers, withholding information from consumers, providing consumers with confusing information and misleading marketing materials, and the disproportionate impact overdraft fees have on low-income and young consumers. These concerns persisted despite the federal banking reforms enacted in 2010 which included the requirement that banks must allow customers to opt in for overdraft protection on their debit cards as opposed to forcing them to opt out if they do not want to participate. A June 2014 article in the New York Times suggests that overdraft fees are still a concern for many consumers and remain a major source of income for banks, which collected $16.7 billion in such fees in 2011.
Bottom Line
U.S. Bank has reached a $55 million dollar settlement in a class action lawsuit with twelve of its customers who represented all current and former U.S. Bank customers who have been charged overdraft fees due to having their debit card transactions reordered from highest to lowest amount. Excessive overdraft fees charged by banks have been the subject of several articles, investigations, lawsuits, etc. in the last five years or so. Those who believe they may be due a disbursement from the U.S. Bank settlement should visit the U.S. Bank Overdraft Settlement Support Website.
Animal Man has been one of my favorite characters ever since I read Grant Morrison's run published in the 80's. This book cemented my love of this character. It was weird and wonderful and full of action and adventure. Plus, at one point Animal Man does hallucinogenics on top of a mountain. That is clearly awesome. Many years later, I'm thrilled to see that one of the best things to come out of DC's New 52 is the brand-new ongoing Animal Man series by Jeff Lemire. Now, Animal Man hasn't eaten any magic mushrooms in their current book (as far as I know anyway) but they really doesn't need to as things are crazy enough on their own. Here are a few reasons why this book MUST be on your reading list. I've tried to leave this as spoiler free as possible so I hope you enjoy!
The Red- So to put it simply, The Red is where all life comes from and what connects it all together. This is what Animal Man taps into in order to use their powers. It's also where freaky “animal-men” live and prepare for battle against the agents of The Rot.
The Rot- This is the big bad of the series so far and is essentially the opposite of what gives Animal Man their powers. Imagine sentient rotting flesh that wants to infect The Red and essentially take over the world. Yeah, I know, gross. So, if you're looking for gore then this book's got you covered. I could have phrased that better, but I chose not to.
Little Wing-This is the nickname of Animal Man's daughter Maxine. They get these crazy powers from The Red and they work it like a BOSS. A pack of Rot-infested animals ripped their body to shreds so they just “jumped” out of their old body and used a fox to create a brand spankin' new body. That's just freaky! Also, let's just say that they have something to do with the war between The Red and The Rot.
Socks the cat- He's a talking cat! I don't care who you are, that's just plain adorable. In reality, they are Ignatius an avatar of The Red. He's taken it upon themselves to guide Maxine and Animal Man during these tumultuous times. But mainly, Socks is adorable and hilarious!
Animal Man- A.K.A. Buddy Baker. Where are they in all of this? Oh yeah, he's an unrelenting bad-ass who will stop at nothing to save their family, not to mention the rest of the world, from all the craziness around him. Usually, the whole superhero with a family thing doesn't work well for me. I normally end up finding it to be too corny or wishing the hero would just leave the kids at home (here's looking at you Wally West). Buddy makes it work though, their family is such a large part of who they are that an Animal Man story just wouldn't be complete if their family wasn't involved in some way. PLUS when Animal Man is in The Red they start to LOOK like the animal he's getting their powers from. That's AWESOME! Although kind of creepy, but still AWESOME!
Those are just a few reasons why Animal Man should be on everyone's reading list. If you are looking for superhero action with a mind bending horror twist then this is the book for you. I hope you give it a chance! Questions? Comments? Bring 'em on!

Ever since the 1980s, when Gerd Binnig of IBM first heard that “beautiful noise” made by the tip of the first scanning tunneling microscope (STM) dragging across the surface of an atom and later developed the atomic force microscope (AFM), these microscopy tools have been the bedrock of nanotechnology research and development.
AFMs have continued to evolve over the years, and at one time, IBM even looked into using them as the basis of a memory technology in the company's Millipede project. Despite all this development, AFMs have remained bulky and expensive devices, costing as much as US $50,000.
Now, researchers at the University of Texas (UT) Dallas have turned this paradigm on its ear by developing an AFM that uses microelectromechanical (MEMS) technology. The upshot: The entire AFM fits onto a computer chip about one square centimeter in size.
In research described in the journal IEEE Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, the scientists connected the MEMS-based AFM to a small printed circuit board containing all the circuitry, sensors, and other miniaturized components that control the device's movements.
While the reduced size, and the likely lower cost associated with the economies of scale for MEMS devices look to be the clearest benefits, it is in how these AFMs take their measurements that truly sets them apart from previous AFM technology. AFMs have always mapped the surface of a material by recording the vertical displacement necessary to maintain a constant force on the cantilevered probe tip as it scans a sample's surface.
Instead of depending on a constant force or distance, the tip of the device developed by the UT scientists oscillates up and down perpendicular to the sample, touching and then lifting off of the surface—a mode known in AFM circles as the “tapping mode". This technique stands in stark contrast to the widely used contact-mode AFM. The UT researchers have developed a novel approach to implementing the tapping mode in an AFM by using a single piezoelectric transducer simultaneously for actuation and sensing, which removes the need for using an optical sensor.
Since the amplitude of the oscillation wants to change as it interacts with sample, this atomic force microscope creates an image by maintaining the amplitude of oscillation.
“Performing the measurement in tapping mode reduces the forces applied to the sample, which is important when scanning fragile samples such as biological specimens,” explained Reza Moheimani, professor of mechanical engineering at UT Dallas and coauthor of the research, in an email interview with IEEE Spectrum.
In tests of the prototype MEMS AFM, the UT Dallas researchers introduced samples into the AFM using the same approach mechanism of a commercial macroscale AFM. The printed circuit board containing the MEMS device was lowered onto the samples using a stepper motor.
“We imagine that a final version of the system would use a similar approach, with a compact motorized mechanism being used to bring the MEMS die in contact with the sample from above,” says Moheimani.
Because the sample would have to be prepared in a similar way as current AFM imaging, the setup would not need to be in a vacuum, Moheimani says. “At this stage, imaging within a liquid environment is not feasible with this device. However, future iterations of the MEMS AFM may be designed with this capability in mind,” Moheimani adds.
The prototype MEMS AFM was designed so that it could be fabricated using a straightforward MEMS process, with all mechanical scanning and sensing components contained in a single silicon-on-insulator MEMS die.
“There were significant challenges in designing the device to comply with the requirements of the fabrication process while obtaining the desired characteristics in terms of mechanical bandwidth, displacement range, and cross coupling,” says Moheimani.
The UT Dallas researchers had to employ an iterative design process in which the testing and characterization of an earlier fabricated version of the device allowed them to better exploit the capabilities of the fabrication process and significantly improve performance in areas such as cross-coupling reduction and reliability of signal routing.
Moheimani and their colleagues already have their sights set on the next engineering challenges for the MEMS AFM. For instance, the sharp probe at the end of the MEMS AFM's cantilever is fabricated in a postprocessing step using electron beam deposition. The researchers are currently working to integrate the fabrication of the probe into the MEMS fabrication process. This will simplify the fabrication of the device and improve its durability.
Additionally, the researchers are looking to miniaturize the supporting electronics and control systems. They're trying out prototype hardware in conjunction with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that interfaces with the MEMS die. This would make it possible to connect with the end user's PC via a single USB connection.
Moheimani adds: “Our ultimate aim is to develop a system that can perform video-rate AFM imaging using a single MEMS chip. The current device successfully demonstrates many of the capabilities required, and future iterations of the device will be designed to further work towards this goal. Such a device would enable high-speed AFM imaging to be performed using a portable and cost-effective system.”
COLUMBIA, S.C. — A South Carolina man made the best of a late-night trip to Waffle House and cooked food for themselves after finding an employee sleeping on the job.
Alex Bowen told WIS-TV they couldn't sleep and was hungry Thursday morning, so they went to the popular restaurant for a late-night snack. When they arrived, there were no other customers or employees in sight — so they walked outside to their car to search for signs of life.
When they walked back inside, Bowen noticed a single employee who was asleep.
After waiting a couple minutes, they jumped on the grill and started making their own food.
“Got hot on the grill with a double Texas bacon cheesesteak melt with extra pickles,” Bowen said. “When I was done I cleaned the grill, collected my ill-gotten sandwich and rolled on out.”
Bowen documented the trip with pictures in a Facebook post.
Bowen stopped by the same Waffle House location Thursday afternoon and says the store isn't very happy with their decision.
“[I] guess old Waffle House just gonna have to take the L on that one,” they told the station.
Bowen said they paid $5 for the melt when they returned.
According to a Waffle House spokesperson, the sleeping employee was suspended for a week.
The Mountain Pygmy-possum, Burramys parvus, is Australia's only hibernating marsupial. There are thought to be fewer than 2000 Mountain Pygmy-possums left in the wild, and the species is listed as Critically Endangered.
All three populations occur in the alpine and subalpine regions of periglacial rock scree and boulderfields: in the Bogong High Plains/Mt Hotham and Mt Buller in Victoria and Mt Kosciusko in New South Wales. The populations are genetically distinct and are managed separately. The possums hibernate for up to 7 months of the year and are dependent on a good blanket of snow to maintain the correct temperature over winter.
Zoos Victoria became involved in the Mountain Pygmy-possum Recovery Program in 2006. Captive breeding may be an important tool for recovering Mountain Pygmy-possums in the future. Healesville Sanctuary currently holds a research and breeding population of 45 Mountain Pygmy-possums, and has successfully bred young over the past 10 years.
The overall objective of the Mountain Pygmy-possum Recovery Program is to achieve down-listing of the Mountain Pygmy-possum from Critically Endangered nationally to a lower threat category based on 1994 IUCN Red List criteria of population size and trends, extent of occurrence, and probability of extinction.
Zoos Victoria's key roles in the recovery of this species are to:
Maintain a reserach population in captivity
Assist with population monitoring programs
Increase community awareness of the plight of the Mountain Pygmy-possum and community support for its conservation

Plans and publications
The road of video game development is long and hard. Studios have to deal with internal and publisher deadlines – not to mention the public's expectation that the game come out on time – that push the time and dedication of developers beyond the confines of a normal work week. This deadline push, which can happen several times during a project, is called crunch time, and it has become an accepted reality of making video games. A 2015 survey by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) revealed that 62 percent of respondents said their projects had a crunch, and half of those said this consisted of working more than 60 hours a week.
Crunch Hurts outlining the problem. "While crunch may be an inevitable part of the game making process," it states, "understanding the mental and physical impact of the practice can lead to better work practices overall, and ultimately happier (and more productive) employees." However, some have questioned the practice, its effectiveness, and most importantly, its effect on developers. Take This is a non-profit charity organization created by ex-Polygon founding editor Russ Pitts, executive editor of GamesRadar+ Susan Arendt, and clinical psychologist Dr. Mark Kline aimed at addressing mental health issues in the industry. Take This and the IGDA have published a report entitledoutlining the problem. "While crunch may be an inevitable part of the game making process," it states, "understanding the mental and physical impact of the practice can lead to better work practices overall, and ultimately happier (and more productive) employees."
The paper cites industry studies that show that longer hours have a positive effect initially, but this decreases. After five weeks of 10-hour days, productivity falls to levels lower than a normal 40-hour work week. The paper also points out a tangible cost: A study of four U.S. companies found that employee fatigue cost an estimated $1,967 per employee each year. Take This co-founder Pitts told us that the organization consulted with its advisory board, which contains developers from around the industry, and received feedback from people with different levels of experience. "People with 'on the ground' perspectives on crunch – both its positive and negative effects – were absolutely a part of this paper's creation," they said.
Being overworked in any industry leads to increased health risks, including worse sleep and a higher risk for heart disease and stroke, and "significantly higher" levels of anxiety and depression, and the disorders associated with them. Long hours also influence employees' home life and therefore those family members' lives as well. In the end, the stresses of overwork can cause some to leave the industry altogether, ending a possibly promising career.
Crunch Hurts cites two studies that state that the crunch itself isn't helping the titles they ostensibly serve. A paper entitled, Impact of Overtime and Stress on Software Quality by James Cusick and Balaji Akula said that software defects were higher for games that required overtime compared with those that didn't, and according to Paul Torzour's As if the human toil wasn't bad enough,cites two studies that state that the crunch itself isn't helping the titles they ostensibly serve. A paper entitled,by James Cusick and Balaji Akula said that software defects were higher for games that required overtime compared with those that didn't, and according to Paul Torzour's Games Outcomes Project , those that reported high crunch had lower Metacritic scores and return on investment.
Crunch Hurts certainly makes the case for the harmful effects of overwork, but it also presents solutions and acknowledges that even if crunch exists, it doesn't have to be detrimental to the game nor developers. "Crunch isn't all bad," says Pitts. "In fact, crunch, in limited, regulated doses, can lead to great leaps in creativity. And we know that if we were to try and tell studios to radically change their process, with no use cases or hard data to back that up, we'd get nowhere fast. Our goal was to provide not only the factual, scientific perspective on the impact of overwork, but also provide real-world suggestions that developers could implement without completely up-ending the process of making games."
The paper advocates short crunch periods followed by short periods of reduced hours or the ability to work from home. Other ways of successfully dealing with crunch outlined include more focused work (set hours, lunches, and breaks) and fewer meetings before milestones to help alleviate the stress; healthy food offerings by companies versus junk food; incentivized health screenings and gym memberships; and telling sick employees to stay home so they not only get better, but so they don't make others sick.
Perhaps most important of all, the paper says that changing crunch culture starts at the top, with management that prioritizes work/life balance and leads by example – including not speaking ill of those who don't overwork – and promoting and backing employees who work more efficiently versus those who simply work more.
Pitts believes the industry has made progress since 2004, when most of the public became aware of the dangers of crunch thanks to developer Erin Hoffman's then-anonymous blog post under the moniker "EA Spouse."
"Companies are now at least taking work-life balance seriously," say Pitts. "I don't think their solutions are always correct, or that they're always looking in the right places, but I do think today you have a lot more people thinking a lot more seriously about employee health, talent retention, and survivability. EA in particular. They've made survivability a huge focus, and as easy as it can be to pile on them with grief, they really are working hard on the problem. Unfortunately, it's a big problem. And game making is still a young industry. Things like mental health, for example, where companies in all industries struggle, are still areas where I see game companies falling down. We've come a long way in the 12 years since EA spouse, but we still have a long way to go."
Hillary's weak leadership would give Putin another four years of nearly unrestrained aggression.

The Democratic National Committee has taken to frantically spinning a narrative of victimhood since it carelessly left its email system vulnerable, resulting in 20,000 internal emails being stolen by hackers.
DNC officials' absurd claim that Russia – specifically President Vladimir Putin – targeted the party to help Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump win the election in November is textbook damage control.
When organizations find themselves defending against self-inflicted crises, the first endeavor is to quickly deflect attention from the facts of the story. What better distraction than their convenient Putin-Trump conspiracy theory? When facts create headaches, they tell a lie, and the bigger that lie the better.
The truth is that Russia surged in global influence from the day Barack Obama assumed the presidency and appointed Hillary Clinton as secretary of State. Their strategy of “leading from behind” enabled the Russian bear to forcefully assert itself in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
Russia filled a void created by the lack of U.S. leadership and a lack of support for American allies around the world. It thrust itself into Egypt, Syria and even parts of Iraq as it expanded its sphere of influence over the past seven years, in addition to its belligerence in Ukraine.
Putin most certainly would hope for a Clinton presidency and the extension of Obama's policies, giving them another four years of nearly unrestrained aggression. It would offer more opportunity compared to a Trump administration, whose “America First” platform would guide its foreign policy.
Because of the DNC's irresponsibility and overt bias towards Clinton during the primary season, the Democrats' convention was damaged and their general election efforts have been jeopardized. They have tried to spin their ineptitude of potentially jeopardizing U.S. national security by portraying Clinton as a victim. If they are a victim, she's a victim of their own recklessness.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
The DNC's digital ineptitude actually refocuses attention on Clinton's own email problems while they served as secretary of State. They turned over 30,490 work-related emails out of a total of 62,320 held on the insecure, private server once housed in the basement of their house, although FBI Director James Comey's investigation recovered several thousand additional work-related emails that they failed to provide to the State Department.
More than 2,000 of those emails Clinton originally turned over to the State Department contained classified information, including nearly two dozen top-secret emails exchanged with three senior aides. While using the unauthorized private email system for their sensitive government work, Clinton was a member of the committee that approved the transfer of a U.S. uranium company to Russia while investors in the deal contributed money to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton also received $500,000 from a Kremlin-backed investment bank for a speech.
We still don't know all the details of what information passed through Clinton's server, but the DNC scandal highlights the significant damage that losing control of even much less sensitive information can cause.
Its correspondence exposed how Democratic Party members stacked the primary process against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The grassroots fought in the trenches for their candidate, while DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the organization they led worked feverishly to tip the scales in favor of Clinton.
As a result of the ensuing embarrassment, Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign less than 24 hours before the start of the Democratic convention. When they attempted to address delegates from their home state of Florida, the audience met them with boos. More DNC officials lost their jobs on Tuesday.
Now think about the information foreign governments and others have on Clinton. The information that they kept on their server must have been hacked, and likely by more than one group or entity. The FBI says there is no proof it was hacked but that sophisticated attackers would not have left evidence. WikiLeaks – which released the DNC emails – the Russians, the Chinese and the Iranians could have some if not all of the information that passed through their server.
That means they would possess tens of thousands of personal emails, business emails and classified emails. That doesn't even include the thousands of emails jeopardized by their staffers' email systems that exchanged messages with hers.
One can only imagine how Putin, WikiLeaks and others may further imperil or blackmail the U.S. should Clinton become president.
The DNC's carelessness endangered its party, its leadership and its fall campaign. More importantly, Clinton's recklessness endangers the U.S.
That's why the DNC propaganda machine is blaring full force. They desperately need voters to focus on who might have hacked the Democrats rather than the irresponsibility of a nominee and a political party that left the door wide open to hackers.

Ottawa and Beijing have struck a deal that will see this country designated as a trading hub for China's yuan currency, a benefit that will lower the cost of doing business for Canadian companies seeking Chinese markets.
The hub, a financial centre sanctioned by China to clear and settle transactions in the Chinese currency, would likely be based in Toronto, sources say.
Some details remain to be worked out but sources say this is expected to be announced during Prime Minister Stephen Harper's trip to China that begins this week.
Story continues below advertisement
It's a sign that efforts to repair relations between Canada and China are bearing fruit.
This hub would mean a great deal in particular to small or medium-sized businesses looking for competitive advantages in dealing with China.
It's been estimated by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce that this hub could generate as much as $32-billion in additional exports over 10 years.
It also gives Canada the first yuan hub in the Americas, which will result in a significant advantage in trade finance – one that could prompt multinationals to move treasury operations to Canada.
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne welcomed the news Tuesday morning.
"There is a rumour that that is the case. I sincerely hope it is the case. I hope that [yuan] trading centre will be located in Toronto," the Premier said. "We've been pursuing this for some months … this would be a very good thing for the financial services industry in Canada."
Chinese companies prefer transacting in their own currency. Otherwise they have to convert their transactions into U.S. dollars, and then "re-convert" back in China.

A yuan trading hub has the financial infrastructure for settlement and clearing, and sufficient liquidity to handle large transactions at a stable and predictable exchange rate.
Mr. Harper heads to Asia Wednesday to try and set the China-Canada relationship on a more even keel after a rough couple of years.
Relations have cooled since Mr. Harper's last trip to Beijing when Canada and China clinched a foreign investment deal.
Since then, the Canadian government has barred Chinese state-owned companies from further investment in the oil sands, raised concern in the media about security risks of buying technology from a major telecom company in China and publicly blamed Beijing for hacking Canadian government computers.
Mr. Harper, who has alternated between a hawk on China who wouldn't sell out to "the almighty dollar" and a pragmatist calling for deeper economic ties, will now try to strike a rapport with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.
The Prime Minister will stop first in Hangzhou, where he'll meet with Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba.
Story continues below advertisement
Making it easier for Canadian companies to do business in the yuan should provide a major boost to Canada's trade and encourage Chinese investors to view Canada as their beachhead in North America.
The likelihood of the deal being signed was greeted with cheers by Neil Tait, a former long-time banking executive in China who is now vice-chair of the Canada-China Business Council, and among the leading voices calling for the creation of a settlement hub.
Not only does it stand to reduce costs for businesses, they said, it will also direct attention toward Canada.
"In Asia, they don't look to Canada as a major financial centre. They look to New York, they look to London, they look elsewhere. Now when they suddenly see this in Canada, it elevates us tremendously, and that itself can presumably open additional doors to us, if we so wish to pursue them," they said.

Coalition vows to stop funding legal advice for asylum seekers
Updated
The Federal Opposition is promising to stop funding immigration advice for asylum seekers if it wins next week's election.
The Coalition has unveiled the final plank of its border protection policy today.
Currently, Australian taxpayers fund refugee claims and legal appeals.
The Coalition says while it would not stop people accessing the help, it would stop funding it.
The move is expected to save about $100 million over four years.
The changes would also mean anyone who arrives by boat or plane and applies for asylum will not get help for free while doing so.
Opposition immigration spokesperson Scott Morrison told the ABC's AM program refugees would have to pay for legal advice.
"People can still make the claims, obviously, and if others in the community want to provide that advice free of charge or they want to pay for that advice, they can continue," they said.
"We won't be stopping access to advice but the taxpayer will no longer be on the hook for it.
"People will be provided in multiple languages how the process works, they'll have interpreters to answer any questions about how the system works but there won't be taxpayer-funded assistance for people to prepare claims or to make appearances.
"If they can access those services privately or otherwise they'll be at liberty to do that."
Shadow attorney-general George Brandis says Australian citizens need legal aid assistance and the funding should not be diverted to asylum seekers.
"Why should there be carte blanche for people who are not Australian citizens, who have come to this country illegally, have chosen of their own volition to place themselves in the hands of people smugglers to get here rather than take advantage of the Australian government's humanitarian entry programs?" they said.
The Coalition has not specified how the saved money would be used.
Refugee advocates, Greens describe move as cruel
The Greens have vowed to block the changes in parliament, arguing without appeals asylum seekers could be sent to their deaths.
Greens Leader Christine Milne condemned the policy.
"This is an incredibly cruel attitude that Tony Abbott is taking, and without the Greens strongly standing there in the Senate and Adam Bandt in the House of Reps there won't be anyone standing up for strong advocacy for human rights, and for decency and for fairness," they said.
Refugee advocate Julian Burnside QC says asylum seekers usually do not have the money to pay for professional advice, so they either represent themselves or get help from an agency.
"The problem is that roughly 50 per cent of people who are knocked back by [Immigration] Department officers in their claim for asylum go to the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT) and get the assessment changed. In other words, Department officers simply get it wrong," they said.
"For a person without representation to go to the RRT is likely to end up in an unfair result if they don't know what they're doing, can't speak the language, and don't have professional help.
"The result of that will be that a number of people who are genuine refugees will be returned to face persecution because they haven't had a fair go in our assessment system."
Mr Burnside added their work with refugees is pro bono, so there is no profit motive to their thoughts against the idea.
The Refugee Action Collective's Chris Breen says the proposal is unfair and unjust.
"It sounds outrageous. It sounds discriminatory. The legal services for asylum seekers, quite literally, save lives," they said.
"Tony Abbott's announcement appears to be just the latest in a horrific series of announcements. We would urge both Rudd and Abbott to step back. We can do better than this."
But Opposition Leader Tony Abbott defended the decision.
"Why should people who come to this country illegally get legal aid to run immigration applications and appeals when so many Australians who find themselves before the courts for whatever reason don't get legal aid," they said.
The ABC tried to contact Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, but did not receive a response.

The best time to pause and take a moment to
breathe is when life is most frantic!
– Lisa Currie
It began as any other ordinary day, but in the end I would never view M&Ms the same way again.
We had finished our hustle and bustle through the Saturday mall traffic and I was bagged. Two kiddies under 6 in toe always make for an eventful shopping adventure. I vaguely recall the days when I could whip into a store and purchase a dozen items in less than 10 minutes. Now getting a pack of gum takes a monumental amount of time, with all the bathroom stops, people gazing, and general ‘squirrel' attention-span dilemmas.
Busting, or rather grunting, our way through the ever-shockingly heavy glass doors, I catch a glimpse of the car in the distance and a sense of freedom finds me. “If I can just get there and sit for a moment, I'll be fine,” crosses my mind. I can tell Liam of 6 and Nathaniel of 4 are feelin' it too, because the whining is just beginning to peak.
We make it, barely it seems, and the boys scramble up and in. I strap the littlest man into the 5-point space seat and make my way to home plate behind the wheel. “Safe!”
All strapped in and a successful thumbs up to the “All buckled up, buttercups?” we are away. As I back up, making sure not to collide with any other bleary-eyed shoppers, Nathaniel blurts out, “Stop da car Mommy!”
I brake hard.
“What is it Nathaniel? What's wrong?” “Jus stop da car Momma, now!”
My curiosity checkmates my reluctance, and I pull back into the parking space.
“What's up little man?” “Close your eyes Mommy. Liam, you close your eyes too, right now, k?”
The irony that lil' Nate, our ever-bouncy Tigger, is asking us to stop, is not lost on Liam or I. And so we are compelled to comply.
“Okay sweetie.”
We close our eyes, and wait for what's next. I must admit I just had to take a peak in the rear view mirror to watch this little cherub with eyes closed, untypically still and a vision of timeless peace. Liam too must realize the seriousness of the moment, as they are as still as that famous church mouse.
Two or three minutes pass, I cannot recall, but as I am seeing it all through the eyes of a 4 year old, it seems a millennium.
Finally, their eyes flutter and flash open. “Okay Momma, you can go now.” Just like that.
Liam comes too, and I take my leave and pull out of the parking lot. I can barely avert my eyes to drive, as I intermittently search Nathaniel's face for a hint of the how and why of what just went down.
I have to ask, “Nathaniel, so tell me sweetie, what was that all about? It was so nice, but I'm just wondering why you had us do that?”
He's not fazed by the question. They shrug and says with a touch of exasperation in their wee voice, “Well, Mommy…It's just that the world gets so crazy sometimes, you just have to stop for a moment.”
Touché. No truer words could be spoken.
On the car ride home we discuss how awesome it is that Nathaniel not only felt and honored their own need to stop, but also had us participate. We talk about how peaceful it is to just sit in silence and be sometimes.
Liam, our Pooh, pipes up, “Good for you ‘Naniel. You so smart.”
I was half engaged in the conversation and half floating as a soul above it all, basking in their light, with awe and joy. These are the connections I dreamed I would one day have with my spirit-centered children – Indeed, a moment to be tucked inside my heart for eternity.
We talk about how we can take Nathaniel's idea and make it a way of life for our family. After hearty debate, we settle on Mindful Moments and the boys between them come up with the ground rules. Mommy adds the acronym. They will be called M&Ms and although it would be years before the boys knew what those tasty morsels are, I could sense a workshop and a book chapter brewing.
And so, here it is Outta the Mouths of Babes, a Sweet, Savory, Tidbit of Wisdom for You and the ground rules as devised by the Maki Brothers.
M&Ms ~ Mindful Moments & the Rules of Engagement
Anyone can call an M&M (Mindful Moment), at any time and all in the vicinity must adhere to the Rules of Engagement. At the moment an M&M is called, everyone must pause, and still immediately (safely :-)). Eyes are to be closed and a focus to be called to silence within and releasing the world and all its chatter and buzz. All must stay silent and still until such time as the M&M Initiator indicates that the time is up and a return to the physical space is allowed. And then, if you feel so inclined, share what was learned/experienced in the M&M. This allows us all to learn from one another and about one another.
These M&Ms have been treasures beyond measure to our entire family and all those we share this vision with. Whether you engage in this alone, with family or friends, we hope this meets you just where you live in a way that calls you to a place of deeper and higher understanding, joy and peace.
Our profound growth is often realized in the simplest embrace of love
and a decision to be aware of the miracles within and around us.
Please note that M&M INgagement is not just for the small, or mentors to pass along. This awareness of the essential need for a rest from the robust, a pause in the midst of even profound, passionate progress, will indeed make for a richer experience in anyone's personal life, business environment, and singular or team atmosphere. Stress meets us all along life's busy, productive path; it is up to us to step off into the forest of relief, and gain some perspective to regain our footing for the ways of peace.
When I present this concept in workshops, retreats and talks for those in corporations, non-profits and anyone determined to choose YES! ways to work and live, I have participants pass a bowl to one another. This bowl is filled with… you guessed it, M&Ms.
I invite you to play along.
Take a candy, one or more, but with a catch… YOU MUST savour and suck it, noooooo biting or crunching. As you hold the M&M in your mouth, be present with it, taste it, experience it, completely. And then as you head back into your life, embrace each day, each moment, with the same intent.
We are not here to live Okay lives. No! We do not want, as we shuffle off this mortal coil, to refrain, “Well, it was an okay life, but it went too soon.”
NO! We want to skip away with a satisfied “YES! What a ride! I may feel I could never have enough moments, but those I had I savored the life out of!” 😛
Live your YES!, your Heroic lives friends. Don the Cape of Possibility; do not miss a second to learn from the babes in your midst; eat chocolate (or the equivalent decadence that delights unique you); and, be ever mindful of each moment you are blessed with.
In celebration of your M&Ms and Schweet Life!

Gomez right now is more popular than Rep. Ed Markey, with a 41-27 favorability rating versus 44-41 for the Democrat. And he's keeping things close thanks to their 47-31 lead with independents, as well as the fact that he's drawing 21 percent of Democrats. Some of these may be folks who voted for Rep. Stephen Lynch in the primary who, as Tom Jensen puts it, may be "a little reticent about supporting Markey in the general." (Lynch did immediately endorse Markey, though, so hopefully they won't be reluctant to keep stumping on their behalf.) Jensen adds, though, that Brown held a 64-32 lead with independents in their final 2010 poll, so Gomez still has a lot of ground to make up if he's going to be the next Scott Brown.
In 2012, one aspect of PPP's Massachusetts polling continually stood out: Undecided voters were much more likely to favor Democrats than Republicans. That's why, even though the head-to-head matchups between Brown and Elizabeth Warren often appeared close, Warren had the edge, since those last few up-for-grabs voters had a strong predilection for Team Blue. The big difference between then and now is that Barack Obama was at the top of the ticket, drawing out lots of voters who won't show up for an early summer special election. Indeed, as Jensen notes, this sample is about 5 points more favorable to Mitt Romney than the 2012 election results were.
But even without Obama, Massachusetts is still a blue state. The undecideds in this poll went for Obama by an 18-point margin last fall, include more self-identified liberals than conservatives, and are over 60 percent female. Those are all positives for Markey, and if they can avoid stumbles and self-inflicted wounds, they should be able to win over the bulk of those undecided voters.
It's far from a walkover, though. Gomez may look like a proverbial fresh face, so Markey is going to have to make voters aware of their true ideology—and that a Gomez win would put Mitch McConnell and the GOP one seat closer to regaining control of the Senate. In other words, he's going to have to run a normal, competitive campaign and not simply coast in the belief that "Massachusetts would never elect a Republican senator."
The other question here is whether national Republicans will commit any money to Gomez. After all, this is only one poll, and while the GOP would love to torment Democrats in Massachusetts yet again, the NRSC may conclude that this race is fool's gold, and that they'd rather save their pennies for next fall. Indeed, whoever wins this seat would have to run again in 2014 for the full six-year term, which means Republicans would need to immediately defend this seat again. That wouldn't be an easy task, but it would certainly be easier than trying to wrest the seat from a Sen. Markey, which would probably be almost impossible.)
The biggest difference between now and the 2010 special that elected Scott Brown, though, is the general political environment—the backdrop, if you will. Three years ago, the economy still felt like it was in free fall to many voters, negative headlines about the Affordable Care Act were a daily feature, and conservatives were convinced that electing Brown would derail the ACA and bring the Democratic agenda to a dead halt. None of that is true today. Indeed, Jensen observes that Obama's job approval rating in Massachusetts stands at 53-41 now, versus 44-43 when Brown won.
And there's also the Martha Coakley factor, which is to say that Democrats are damn well determined not to get caught sleeping a second time. That just means, though, that Democrats know they have to work hard to make sure this seat stays blue. Markey may have a small edge, but from now until the special election on June 25, it's nose to the grindstone and absolutely no letting up.
Arda Turan will become the second signing of the summer at FC Barcelona. The Catalan club has reached an agreement with Atletico Madrid and the player for a transfer to take place during the current window.
Albert Roge
The Turkish player's release clause is 41 million euros, although Barça will not have to pay that much. Josep Maria Bartomeu completed the agreement during a recent meeting in Ibiza with Atletico's Gil Marin. For now, the terms of the Arda's contract are unknown and it's not been revealed where they will play until January, when Barça can register players again.
Now, the only doubt is when Arda Turan will begin to work under Luis Enrique. Pre-season begins on July 13, with elections taking place on July 18. In the case that Lucho wants them from the first day, it will be the iterim board that complete the transfer. If Lucho can wait, the new board will finalise the agreement.
With Arda Turan, Barcelona strengthen their options in midfield with a player who has impressed in Spain while playing for Atletico Madrid.
The player has already announced their decision to leave the Rojiblanco and has finally decided to accept Barça's offer over the ones on the table from Chelsea and Manchester United.

A new poll shows that most Democratic voters want the party to move left, with new people in charge. In other words, they want a political revolution.
They've got the right idea.
If the party establishment thinks Robert Mueller's investigation will save it, it's probably wrong. After President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro Agnew were both removed from office for malfeasance, Jimmy Carter barely eked out a win in 1976. Four years later, Ronald Reagan's victory ushered in 12 years of Republican leadership in the White House.
That's a lesson for today's Democrats. High crimes and misdemeanors don't automatically translate into enthusiasm for the other party, especially in today's murky political environment. Corruption is more likely to lead to cynicism than to citizen involvement, unless voters are given something to believe in.
A Left Majority Led By Women and People of Color
Democratic voters apparently know what they believe in. In the latest Harvard-Harris poll, a sample of the party's base voters was asked, “Do you support or oppose movements within the Democratic Party to take it even further to the left and oppose the current Democratic leaders?”
Fifty-two percent of those polled said they support those movements, while 48 percent said they oppose them. That's a call to political insurrection. These voters want to change the party's ideology. They “oppose” (that's a strong word, “oppose”) the people who have been running it for decades.
If the implications for the party's upcoming races seem clear, the long-term implications are even more stark: 69 percent of voters aged 18-34 said they support those insurrectionary movements.
Among other things, the Harvard-Harris poll disproves the “Bernie Bros” canard so beloved by the party's establishment. Democratic insiders have repeatedly insisted that the party's left is dominated by white males. The implication is that the left is somehow sexist and/or racist.
But the poll shows that support for the left is greater among female voters (55 percent), Hispanic voters (65 percent), and African-American voters (55 percent) than it is among whites (46 percent) or men (49 percent).
Identity and Economy
It shouldn't be surprising that Democratic women and people of color are more left-leaning than their white, male counterparts. They're more likely to suffer the economic consequences of racism and sexism ― forms of oppression that are structural as well as social in nature. Some of those signs of structural oppression include:
African Americans are the only racial group in the country who are still worse off economically today than they were in 2000. Black people in this country are more likely to lack health insurance, and the black-white wage gap is worse today than it was in 1979.
Women working full-time in the United States last year earned only about 80 cents for every dollar a man made, according to the latest Census Bureau data. (The marginal decrease in the gender wage gap was due at least in part to falling wages among men.)
Black women working full-time earned only 63 cents for every dollar earned by a white male, Native women earned only 57 cents and Latinas earned only 54 cents. Households led by women were much more likely to be impoverished than male-led households.
While some Democratic leaders, along with their media backers, have tried to argue that the left's agenda is antithetical to “identity politics,” that dichotomy would have been rejected by pioneers like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Margaret Sanger, both of whom were leftists.
As for younger voters, they've grown up under the most economically unequal conditions in more than one hundred years. Social mobility is down. Millions are burdened with staggering student debt. The entry-level job market has been poor since at least 2008, and their generation has been plagued with under-employment that's likely to cripple their lifetime earning potential.
Is it any wonder they're unimpressed with party leaders whose main claims to leadership are their lengthy résumés as members of the ruling elite?
Leftward Movement
Wisely, these voters are looking to “movements,” and not to the party itself, for answers. That's where change is likely to be born ― from the activism of those who understand that economics and identity are inseparable. It's certainly not going to come from leaders who seem determined to purge the representatives of those movements, while at the same time trying to elevate corporate lobbyists to leadership positions.
Nothing could be more antithetical to the wishes of the party's base, as expressed in this poll.
There are those who say the party's base voters are wrong, as a hedge-funder turned Democratic operative did recently. They claim that a “left” agenda will lead the party to defeat. They're wrong, for at least three reasons.
Working Class
First, many of the left's ideas appeal to voters across the political spectrum. A number of polls (see here, here, and here, for example) have shown that most voters – including most Republicans – support expanding Social Security.
Donald Trump won the GOP nomination – and ultimately the presidency – in part because they adopted left-seeming positions on trade, job creation, and cracking down on Wall Street. (A bitter irony, I know.)
Despite improvement in the topline economic numbers, voters remain deeply uncertain about their economic prospects and the nation's future. 60 percent of respondents to the Harvard-Harris poll said the country is “off on the wrong track.”
Economic uncertainty affects voting across racial and ethnic lines. Regarding Trump voters, pollsters Pete Brodnitz and Jill Normington told House Democrats earlier this year:
“We suffer from the lack of an identifiable positive agenda. Without it, voters will turn to Trump for progress. With it, we can make significant gains.”
That doesn't mean Democrats should adopt a race-based approach. Turnout was down significantly for black and Hispanic voters last year, which may well have changed the race's outcome. An “identifiable positive agenda” on the economy is likely to bring out more working-class people of color as well.
Democrats don't need a “white” strategy. They need a “working class” strategy.
The Vanishing Persuadables
Second, establishment Democrats have spent far too long trying to appeal to that rapidly-vanishing creature known as the “persuadable” voter, perhaps because that approach suited their own ideology (or self-interest) very neatly. Survey data shows that fewer such voters exist with every passing year.
In this environment, turnout is a much more decisive factor than persuasion. Conservatives are more likely to vote than liberals, and early polling indicates that Republicans will outperform Democrats on turnout again in 2018.
To boost turnout, Democrats should look to candidates and policies that mobilize left-leaning voters.
A Movement is More Than a Party
The third point is the simplest one of all. It's hard to argue that the leftward path leads to defeat when the party's had so many losses under its current, more right-leaning ideology. Arguments about how to win are most persuasive when they come from people who win on a regular basis. Democrats are out of power in all three branches of the federal government and two-thirds of the states, which means the party's current leaders don't have much credibility on the subject.
With any luck, Mueller's investigation will bring Donald Trump and their team the justice they so richly deserve. But that won't save the Democrats.
The party's voters are looking to movements to bring them new leaders and a leftward shift. That's smart. Movements have energy, independence, and commitment. They can reshape a party's leadership, infuse it with new ideas, and populate it with activists. That's because a movement is more than a party. It's something broader and deeper, something that infuses its members' lives with purpose and meaning.

Police suspect organised crime gang after Melbourne toy store hit twice, with door and CCTV records stolen
Lego thieves make off with $15,000 of goods in toy store break-ins
Thieves have made off with $15,000 worth of Lego from a toy store in two robberies police say have the hallmarks of an organised syndicate.
Toyworld in Seymour, north of Melbourne, was targeted on 24 May and again on Sunday, with thieves removing and stealing the store's glass sliding-door and its CCTV hard drives on both raids.
“There are a lot of other things they could probably steal that would be worth a lot more … but they're only targeting Lego,” the store's owner, Werner Baumann, told 3AW radio.
The haul, mostly Lego Technic and Lego City brands, would have required at least two or three people and “a van of some sort”, they said.
Senior Detective Ian Porter of Victoria Police said the sophisticated nature of the robbery suggested the work of “an organised syndicate”.
“We believe they had some sort of glazing experience and possibly possessed tools to remove the glass without breaking it,” they said.
Baumann said a number of small toy shops in the area had been targeted by thieves bent on pilfering the classic toy bricks, which in the past twelve months had become “one of the hottest toy properties in Australia”.
A 3D animated feature released this year, the Lego Movie, has grossed more than $400m worldwide at the box office.
Police said the Lego was likely to be sold online or at a market, and appealed to the public to be vigilant.
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill was one of the largest environmental disasters in history, releasing roughly 4 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. For the Atlantic bluefin tuna, it occurred at the worst time of year, during peak spawning season, when eggs and larval fish that are particularly vulnerable to environmental stressors exist in mass quantity.
In a study published in Nature: Scientific Reports, scientists from Stanford and NOAA provide the best yet analysis of how the 2010 breeding season might have been impacted by the oil spill.
Although the spill encompassed a relatively small proportion of the bluefin tuna spawning grounds, which extend throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico, the authors showed the cumulative oiled tuna habitat was roughly 3.1 million square miles, representing the potential for a significant impact on eggs and larval bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico.
The authors concluded that the spill impacts combined with the multiple stressors of ocean warming and fishing pressure could make it more difficult for this unique population to rebuild.
"We know that bluefin tuna face numerous threats in the Gulf of Mexico and the oil spill represents another potential impact during a critical portion of their life history," said Elliott Hazen of NOAA Fisheries' Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California, and first author of the study.
The scientists directly mapped the preferred spawning habitat of the Atlantic bluefin tuna by drawing from a 16-year data set of electronic tagging data from 66 fish, which provided information such as the animals' locations, temperatures and unique diving patterns after up to a year of being tracked on sojourns of thousands of miles. They then overlaid this data with satellite observations of the oil spill's reach, to map the potential impact.
"It took us many years to establish and perfect the techniques of putting a satellite tag, essentially a small computer, on giant bluefin tuna, many over 1,000 pounds in this study, and figure out exactly where and when they potentially spawn in the Gulf of Mexico," said study co-author Barbara A. Block, a professor of marine sciences at Stanford. Block led the effort to discern exactly where and when the bluefin spawns.
They found that the timing of the oil spill directly overlapped with the maximum extent of adult bluefin tuna foraging and spawning habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. At its peak in May 2010, the spill covered more than 5 percent of the spawning habitat of the Atlantic bluefin tuna in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.
Exposure to oil has previously been shown to have physiological consequences to the heart, and can cause deformations and death in eggs and larval fish, making it crucial to understand the effects in order to assess the impacts of oil spills. The effect of oil on spawning adult fish is not as well understood but the crude oil may add stressors to all life history stages occurring in the Gulf of Mexico.
"The bluefin tuna population in the Gulf of Mexico has been struggling to rebuild to healthy levels for over 30 years," Block said. "These fish are a genetically unique population, and thus stressors such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, even if minor, may have population-level effects. It is difficult to measure recruitment from the Gulf of Mexico post-2010, as the fish take a long time to enter into the commercial fishery where monitoring occurs, so we remain concerned."
The researchers said that their results are only inferring that the Deepwater Horizon spill likely harmed a sliver of the spawning habitats, and thus at least some of the 2010 class of bluefin tuna, but further monitoring is needed to understand how that affects the population at large.
"Because of their economic and ecological importance, we need to ensure the conservation and protection of the Atlantic bluefin tuna on their spawning grounds," Hazen said. "We need to ensure maintained -- if not increased -- monitoring of the Atlantic bluefin tuna in the years to come."
Lucas Moura was tipped as one of the world stars of the future during their time with São Paulo, with some even believing they could be better than the country's other prospect Neymar. Several years on, and although both have made an impact for their country and in European football, there isn't even a debate when it comes to be better player.
Neymar has shone for Barcelona, emerging as the best player in the world behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile becoming a part of the most feared attack in world football. In contrast, at the same time, Lucas Moura has failed to make the desired impact at PSG, and hasn't nailed down a place in the national side, even missing out on the World Cup in their homeland.

Although they are well liked by PSG supporters and the owners have them down as a central ingredient of their project, they will be concerned at their lack of progress at the club. Lucas is still battling to hold down a starting berth at the French champions, and the interest in him; especially from Liverpool, could appeal.
At the age of 23, they have time on their side and a move to a new league may aid their development. Furthermore, the possibility of becoming a key part of an exciting project under a tactically astute, young coach like Jurgen Klopp in a competitive league will be an attractive proposition for the Brazilian.
They have been criticised by the French media often, with Le Parisien voting the Brazilian the worst PSG player over the first half of last season. That may have been harsh as there were bigger disappointments in the side, but it may be indicative of the large expectations that were placed upon them when they joined the club.
A move to a new team would give the 23-year-old a fresh start in a new environment, one in which there is less pressure. Although the Liverpool fans are demanding, at PSG, the side are expected to dominant Ligue 1 and seriously challenge for the Champions League. The Reds are not quite at that level yet, but they will aim to become one of England's most successful clubs again under Klopp. Lucas may benefit from developing naturally with Liverpool, making it a sensible move for both parties.

For Liverpool, they are looking for more attacking options, with Sadio Mane also on their radar. They will want to bring in dynamic, direct and tactically flexible players that fit seamlessly into Klopp's high intensity style of play. Lucas is certainly that, while they also have the potential to grow into a world-class player with the right coaching.
Currently, Liverpool are not at the level to attract the best players in the world, but those with a profile similar to Lucas are very appealing. Klopp will look to build a young, hungry side with the ability to develop together into a Champions League team. In these regards, Lucas is perfect in every single way. The price tag could prove to be an issue, as they still have a lot of value and PSG will be aware of that.
In terms of their style, Lucas is quick and very skilful with tremendous ability with the ball at their feet. This can make them highly exciting to watch. The Brazilian beats players with ease and has an eye for goal, with a direct style. In recent months, they have also become effective in the air, with an impressive leap, leading to a great deal of headed goals. Their pace makes them difficult to deal with, while their end product is improving.
It must be said that Lucas is not at the level at which they wanted to be by this stage in their career, but that does not mean they aren't a wonderful player. Their positional flexibility is also appealing, capable of playing on either the right or left side of the attack. Liverpool already have Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino. If they add Lucas, they could have an exciting attacking trio of Brazilians, possibly one of the most naturally gifted in the entire of England's top flight.

It is clear that Lucas Moura is a very talented individual, who has yet to take the European game by storm like they were expected to. However, they have hardly been a failure at PSG, with some good performances and crucial goals helping the club improve.
Their price-tag has always shackled him, and the lack of competition on a weekly basis is not great for players trying to further their games. Meanwhile, Liverpool are desperate to add attacking quality and a young, hungry player with the experience of Lucas could be a perfect signing. This move is very much in its primary stages, but it makes a lot of sense for both sides.

You would be shocked by how insane things have gotten on the internet then. I'll help explain a bit. A year and a few months ago. A female developer was claimed to have had... certain favors for 5 video game journalists, a few of which wrote about their game.
This noticeably made people extremely curious for a good reason. That is super unethical. They simply asked the question prevailing their minds. "Um... hey... journalism? Isn't that super unethical? Are you really doing this?"
That is when shit hit the fan in a way you would never hope to believe. Journalists every where clamped down fucking hard and told everyone that gamers were sexist pieces of shit and reddit and even 4chan began censoring the living hell out of their sites to try and get rid of not only the beginnings of GG, but also that of the Fappening which was happening around that time. (Also proven that a lot of mods are in the pockets of the SJW horde which we all now face.)
This is when battle lines were drawn and gamers began looking into game journalism more and more. This is when Adam Baldwin first made the hashtag Gamergate... The firefly actor Baldwin... yeah.
This is also when a guy named Milo, A gay republican journalist discovered the smoking gun. Nearly every single journalist in the medium of gaming was apart of a group on Google as they emailed each other back and forth, deciding what to do about certain things and what information should be talked about.
This is majorly unethical. If this happened in any other medium heads would fucking roll. Espicially considering there were quite a few emails talking about how to quell GG as a whole by censorship.
Gaming journalism shut the hell up about everything and have been basically in hiding since. They have tried to keep quiet about nearly everything they do due to GG being there looking.
This has become a stalemate in which it has been blamed for pretty much being the worst thing since malaria. When it still has been against insanely petty journalism. GG itself has been honestly a super charitable organization without a leader. They have at least over 200K of donations in the name of feminist gaming developers who were abused by the anti side of the debate and many different animal species, mainly pandas and sea lions.
They also helped a pornstar who became disabled to get a chair lift in their house along with helping another pornstar who had been brutally raped by a person.
You will never read about this in the news because, due to GG being filled with gamers, Gamers are the natural enemy of old media. Old media now uses GG as a boogeyman to scare mothers and old people about gaming.
All the while the anti side has been legitimately full of the most insane people I have ever seen. Hell, just last week, one of the major people against GG was caught redhanded as a major pedophile and a bunch of the anti side defended the person even when said person fully admitted to the crime... some anti being Chris Kluwe the NFL star and Arthur Chu the jeopardy champion.
This is just a taste of how freaking weird things have been. I could honestly write a lord of the rings trilogy about the entire thing. It has been internet drama since day 1 and for a internet movement. It has pretty much succeeded with every single objective it had in mind in the beginning which for a leaderless movement is legitimately impressive.
The weirdest thing though. They pretty much are the front line to what is going to be a battle for free speech these days with how bad the PC crap has gotten. Just take a look at what the UN said to video games being the creation of Satan in a recent conference where major anti people somehow got up to the UN levels.
I am not making a single thing up. This is just as weird as I am making it.
Cabinet ministers come out in support of dumped Tony Abbott following media interviews
Updated
A string of Cabinet ministers have come forward in support of dumped prime minister Tony Abbott, saying they have the right to defend their legacy.
Cabinet minister Christopher Pyne said they welcomed Mr Abbott's input following a series of media interviews detailing last month's leadership change.
I think he's handled themselves with a lot of class and distinction, and I think he's earned the right to explain to the Australian people what it is they sought to do as prime minister. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann
Mr Pyne, who was promoted from education minister to Industry Minister under new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, said the comments were justified.
They told Channel Nine that they would expect Mr Abbott to do more interviews in the future.
"I don't think he's being unhelpful," Mr Pyne said.
"Primarily he's putting their best foot forward."
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann also defended Mr Abbott, saying they had handled themselves "really well".
Senator Cormann told the ABC there was nothing suspicious about the timing of their interviews, saying it was simply coincidence that Mr Abbott was speaking live on air while the current Prime Minister was convening an economic summit in Canberra on Thursday.
"What happened two or so weeks ago was difficult for him," Senator Cormann said.
"I think he's handled themselves with a lot of class and distinction, and I think he's earned the right to explain to the Australian people what it is they sought to do as prime minister."
Mr Abbott has said they have more to contribute in public life and will consider their future closer to Christmas.
Cabinet Secretary Arthur Sinodinos told the ABC that Mr Abbott should be encouraged to continue their work in Parliament if they wished to.
"As Janette Howard said to John Howard in 1989, as people said to Malcolm Turnbull in 2010, 'If you still have a contribution, feel you still have a contribution to make to politics, by all means do so'," they said/
Speaking to 3AW's Neil Mitchell on Thursday, Mr Abbott refused to say whether they had forgiven Mr Turnbull for last month's leadership change.
"There's obviously been a lot of dirty water under the bridge," they said.
"I guess in time, all things are more readily understood, more readily accommodated and seen in proper perspective."
Government in 'state of undeclared civil war'
Labor has leapt on Mr Abbott's comments, with Opposition transport spokesperson Anthony Albanese describing the Government as being in a "state of undeclared civil war".
They told Channel Nine that Mr Abbott was obviously angry over the leadership spill.
"[Mr Abbott is] out there defending their legacy and saying very unhelpfully to their colleagues that somehow this isn't a good government," they said.
The Opposition has also targeted the new Prime Minister in recent interviews, with Mr Albanese using Mr Turnbull's penchant for public transport as a policy talking point.
Speaking in Melbourne, they urged Mr Turnbull to return funding cut from public transport spending, highlighting their social media updates on travels.
"One-in-five dollars has been cut from investment in infrastructure," Mr Albanese said.
"It's about time that Malcolm Turnbull got serious about investment in infrastructure. That means investing in public transport, not just riding on it."
Albanese calls for negotiations to end China FTA stand-off
Mr Albanese also urged the Government to be more flexible on negotiations over the China Free Trade Agreement.
They said they were hopeful that an agreement could be reached "with a bit of common sense".
"This certainly can be fixed and it should be fixed as soon as possible," Mr Albanese said.
"We'll see if the Government is prepared to put the national interest first, which it should, instead of playing politics."
The Government is already showing more flexibility in communication with the crossbench, according to a key independent senator.
Senator Glenn Lazarus told the ABC there had been increased consultation from the Government under Mr Turnbull.
Senator Lazarus said it was a departure from the communications model under Mr Abbott.
"Tony didn't seem to want to engage with me or the crossbench," they said.
"As the communications minister, Malcolm was very forthcoming with their time, their door was always open. I'm hoping, and it looks as though, that's the attitude he's taking into their new role as Prime Minister."
Senator Lazarus said they had been "buoyed" by the new leadership, describing the shelving of university deregulation legislation as a personal victory.
"I think, deep down, this is something that will just peter away," they said.
"I just feel as though they've come to their senses."
Education Minister Simon Birmingham confirmed on Thursday that the Government would shelve the controversial plan in this term.
Senator Birmingham said the legislation, taken to Parliament by the former education minister Mr Pyne, would not be reintroduced for a vote before the next election.

New Year's kicked off with familiar favorites, “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” and “Sing,” dominating the domestic box office. Both films have emerged as the biggest hits of the holiday season.
The “Star Wars” spinoff topped the box office, just as it has since opening three weeks ago. “Rogue One” racked up $64.3 million for the four-day holiday weekend. That pushes its North American total to $439.7 million, putting it in second place among last year's highest-grossing domestic releases. Globally, “Rogue One” has made $774.9 million through Sunday, with China, the world's second-largest film market, yet to open.
Disney, which released “Rogue One” through its Lucasfilm banner, has four of the year's top five domestic earners, including “Finding Dory,” which was the highest-grossing stateside film with $486.3 million. The company had a lot riding on “Rogue One.” It invested roughly $4 billion to the rights to the “Star Wars” canon, with a goal of creating a cinematic universe to rival Marvel's. “Rogue One” is the first of several planned spinoff films that will exist outside of the main Skywalker family saga. Disney is also readying a film about Han Solo's origins, with Alden Ehrenreich poised to inherit Harrison Ford's blaster.
“Sing,” an animated story about a talent competition involving animals, picked up $56.4 million, bringing the film's domestic total to $180 million. “Sing” is the latest offering from Illumination and Universal. The partners have previously collaborated on “Despicable Me” and last summer's hit, “The Secret Life of Pets.” What makes Illumination's accomplishments particularly impressive is that “Sing” cost $75 million to make at a time when most major animated releases carry budgets in excess of $100 million. “Sing” features vocal work from Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, and Taron Egerton, as well as music from the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, and Stevie Wonder.
In third place, “Passengers,” a science-fiction romance with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, earned $20.7 million over the four days, pushing its domestic gross to $66 million. “Passengers” is being watched closely, because it is the first major greenlight of Tom Rothman's reign as studio chief at Sony. With a $110 million budget and millions more spent in promotion, “Passengers” is banking on foreign crowds to lift it into the black. To that end, the film caught a break, scoring a release date in China on Jan. 13 — Chinese conglomerate Wanda, an investor on the film, will help with marketing in the Middle Kingdom.
Fox's “Assassin's Creed” made $10.8 million over the holiday. The video game adaptation has earned a lackluster $41.9 million since opening over Christmas. With a hefty $125 million budget, it will need foreign audiences to turn out in force if it wants to avoid a write-down.
Fox has had more success with “Why Him?,” a mid-budget comedy with Bryan Cranston and James Franco. The film centers on a generational clash between a father who hates their daughter's boyfriend. It earned $13 million over the four-day holiday and has made $37.5 million domestically.
The end of the year also played host to a slew of awards seekers. Paramount's “Fences” has scored among the adult dramas flooding theaters. The August Wilson adaptation is generating Oscar buzz for star and director Denzel Washington, as well as for Viola Davis. Both actors appeared in an acclaimed 2010 Broadway revival of the play. The drama earned $12.7 million over the holiday and has made $32.4 million since debuting three weeks ago in limited release.
Paramount also fielded the religious drama “Silence.” It's a passion project for Martin Scorsese, who has been trying to bring the story of Jesuits in feudal Japan to the screen for decades. “Silence” earned $110,000 in four locations over the weekend, bringing its total to $337,000. The movie, a cerebral examination of spirituality, will need to get Oscar attention if it wants to resonate with mainstream crowds.
Lionsgate's “La La Land” is a hit with critics and audiences. The musical reunites Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, who previously appeared together memorably in “Crazy Stupid Love” and less so in “Gangster Squad.” It earned $12.3 million over the four-day holiday, bringing its gross to $37 million. Along with “Manchester by the Sea” and “Moonlight,” “La La Land” is seen as a leading contender for the best picture statue at the upcoming Academy Awards.
Fox's “Hidden Figures,” a drama about a team of African-American scientists who calculated flight plans during the early days of the space program, earned an impressive $1.1 million for the four days from just 25 theaters. It goes into wide release next weekend. Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, and Taraji P. Henson star in the historical film.
“Patterson,” Jim Jarmusch's look at a soulful bus driver, made $88,167 for the long weekend, bringing its gross to $119,657. It is being released by Amazon Studios and Bleecker Street, with Adam Driver starring.
“Live by Night,” a Warner Bros. gangster picture with Ben Affleck, continued to struggle in limited release. The film picked up $50,000 from four theaters for a paltry per-screen average of $12,548. It opens in wide release on Jan. 13.
CBS Films and Lionsgate's “Patriots Day” earned $200,000 from seven theaters to bring its total to $681,000. The story of the Boston Marathon bombing expands nationally in two weeks.
Roadside Attractions ended the year on a high note. The indie distributor behind “Manchester by the Sea” and “Hello, My Name is Doris” announced that it had its best year ever from a box office perspective with $75.7 million. Its previous highest-grossing year was in 2013 when it took in $44.8 million.

BOULDER CITY, Nev. — Even for a regular like Allen Keeten, who has been visiting here since the late 1970s, the retreating shoreline of Lake Mead behind Hoover Dam is a shock to witness.
"I hate to see it,'' the 58-year-old truck driver from Kenesaw, Neb., says, peering over the side of the massive concrete dam on the Colorado River. "Nowadays you've got to be careful when you are out on a boat because of all the exposed ground.''
Like a giant measuring stick in the desert, the dropping water level of Lake Mead, the nation's largest human-made reservoir, provides a vivid representation of the drought that is gripping the Southwest and much of the West.
Since the dam was built during the Great Depression, water that falls as snow on the Rocky Mountains as far north as Wyoming and collects in the Colorado River has been stored and diverted to quench the thirsts of Southern California, Las Vegas and parts of Arizona.
Only a fraction of the river's flow makes it to Mexico as millions of acre-feet leave the Colorado River system through pipes and aqueducts for use by farms, businesses and homes of the southwestern United States — the water rights apportioned by decades of court cases, contracts and legislation.
Now that measuring stick is drier than ever. Federal water managers say Lake Mead is just 39% full. The water level fell in July to its lowest level since 1937, when water began backing up to form Lake Mead after the dam was completed.
The level of the lake fell this month to just over 1,081 feet above sea level, 139 feet below the nearly 1,220-foot capacity.
As the water recedes, left behind is a broad white stripe of mineral deposits on the lake's shoreline, as visible as a dirty bathtub ring. New islands poke through the lake's lowered surface, and buoys stand amid desert scrub.
Entire coves and miles of lake fingers have dried up, forcing boat landings and marinas to close or relocate. Marina operators who want to stay in business have had to move their floating docks — and the fuel, electricity, water and sewer lines that serve them — in a costly chase to stay on the water.
"It definitely impacts our business. People get scared away,'' says Bob Gripentog, 61, whose family has owned and operated Lake Mead Marina since the 1950s.
"There's still 500 miles of shoreline, still a lot of water,'' they say. "But it's harder to get in and out of.''
Officials of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's offices here, who control the river flow and distribution of water within legal guidelines, expect Lake Mead's level to decline a bit more before recovering some as water held further upstream in Lake Powell is released.
Lake Powell is down, too, though not as badly at 52% of capacity. The entire Colorado River system of four impoundments, ending with Lake Havasu in Arizona, has just over half the water it is capable of holding this summer.
Still, federal water managers are optimistic that they can avoid reducing agreed-upon amounts of water to all who depend on it, at least until next year. Beyond that, much depends on how long drought continues.
"We need to use our water much more wisely than we have,'' says Terry Fulp, regional director of the Bureau of Reclamation. "As a society we have to recognize the value of water and the scarcity of water.''
"We have a long-term issue that we have to grapple with,'' they say.
The water level this summer could have been worse. Precipitation and water runoff from the Rockies has been strong this year, about 96% of the historical average, according to federal hydrologist Daniel Bunk. In June, the runoff was 114% of normal.
The snowpack in California's Sierra Mountains, on the other hand, has been well below average since 2011, the last good year for water runoff.
Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the wholesaler that distributes water to scores of local governments from San Diego to Los Angeles, says extreme dry conditions and record heat the past two years in California have put unprecedented pressure on the region's water system.
Water from the Colorado River makes up about a quarter of all water that flows from Southern California taps, and water from the Sierras makes up about 30%, with the remainder coming from local sources, groundwater and reclaimed water.
The Southern California district stockpiled water in previous wet years and has been drawing on those reserves this year to make up for shortages in the flow from Northern California.
Conservation measures have been largely voluntary across much of California, but that is changing. California's State Water Resources Control Board in July approved mandatory if modest conservation steps backed by fines.
Aimed at reducing urban outdoor water use, the regulations require local water agencies to impose fines for hosing down driveways and sidewalks, allowing excessive runoff from landscape irrigation and using drinkable water in ornamental fountains unless it is recirculated.
Shortages from the Sierras make the water flowing through Lake Mead all the more important for tens of millions of people in California.
Bunk, manning the high-tech river flow control room not far from Hoover Dam, says the Bureau of Reclamation estimates that there is about a 23% chance that Lake Mead's water levels could fall below 1,075 feet, the point at which water distributions to some agencies may have to be reduced, next year. By 2017, they say, the risk is 50%.
An especially wet winter would help. A big snowpack in 2011 raised Lake Mead nearly 50 feet in one season.
"We need several above-average years to replenish the storage,'' Bunk says.
But the trends are worrisome. While California is in the third year of drought, Bunk says Colorado River data suggests this is the 15th year of a broader regional drought, interrupted by an occasional wet year.
Scientists studying tree rings for clues to past water seasons calculate that the period since 2000 is one of the driest in centuries. Bunk says the evidence shows the past 15-year period ranks in the driest 1% of the past 1,200 years.
"It really puts into light how severe this drought is, and yet we have been able to maintain water distribution,'' they say.
Unseen water levels are falling too. Jay Famiglietti, water scientist with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, says the drought has led to alarming depletion of groundwater sources. As water from the Sierras has slowed to a trickle, agriculture — by far the biggest user of water in California — has relied on water drawn from wells as a replacement source.
In a paper published Thursday, Famiglietti and five other scientists called the Colorado River basin "the most over-allocated in the world" and said groundwater — difficult to replenish — can't make up the difference indefinitely.
"The dropping level in Lake Mead is a very visual if not frightening reminder of the severity of drought,'' Familigetti says. "If the drought continues and water levels continue to dry up, it's going to have huge hydropower and water-availability implications.''

When doing research for the piece I wrote yesterday about how Jupiter is the best planet (not counting Earth), I came across an ominous headline in an 1880 edition of The New York Times: “A Deceptive Planet.”
Here we go. Scientists observing Jupiter 135 years ago, it seems, found the planet's whorling, colorful blanket of clouds and anti-hurricanes to be perplexing, if not outright maddening. Here's an excerpt from the essay I particularly liked, with spacing added to relieve your eyeballs of 19th-century typesetting:
It was generally hoped that, in couse [sic] of time, this much respected orb would see the error of their ways, and cease to assume the appearance of an inebriated planet. Sad to relate, however, they have gone from bad to worse, and is just now showing, side by side with the red spot complained of, a number of white ones, which give their countenance an appearance truly sad to behold. No wonder that quiet, staid astronomers, who, from joking, stand aghast at such an exhibition. For many years Jupiter has held a deservedly high place in their estimation, and they had come to regard them as a globe of such regular habits that they might be depended upon in any emergency. They had long ago declared them to be as ‘cool as a cucumber,' and were half inclined to allot both atmosphere and inhabitants to him, when they break out in this unexpected way. All their calculations are consequently upset. They may be in boiling heat for all we know, a deceptive planet who has attempted to look calm and cold while all the time they have been in a state of furious conflagration. This teaches astronomers to be chary in future of giving a good character to any heavenly body. If Jupiter be so bad as this, what may be expected of stars that have no reputation to lose?
(As an aside, who knew ‘cool as a cucumber' had such deep etymological roots? It traces back to 1732, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary.)
Many people refer to Zoe as an albino, but Zoe actually is not an albino zebra. They have a condition called amelanosis. Amelanism, or amelanosis, is a pigmentation abnormality characterized by the lack of color pigments called melanins. Albinism is the complete absense of color pigments or melanins. Zoe's body is white and their stipes are a beautiful golden beige color. They also have beautiful bright blue eyes!
As of now, the only health problems they are aware of is the fact that they have poor night vision. As they age they may incur some complications due to the amelanism such has kidney problems. As a precaution they are fed a low protein diet and is monitored closey for skin cancer, which is more common among animals with amelanism. Because of their condition, Zoe will not be bred.
The socialist mayor of Montpellier, Helene Mandroux, will on Wednesday, May 29, on the steps of city hall, marry France's first gay couple.
Vincent Autin, 40, and their partner Bruno Boileau, 30, will tie the knot after months of passionate debate and large protests, especially in Paris, for and against France becoming the 14th country to legalize same-sex marriage on May 18.
"It could be intimidating," Boileau said, speaking about the likely media circus that will surround the couple. "But we will try to retain the spirit of the goal -- equality for all. That Mister or Miss Anybody can get married in the town hall."
On Sunday, an estimated 150,000 people rallied in Paris to protest the law - supported by President Francois Hollande - that gave gay men and women the right to marry. France is technically a secular state, but it has a very vocal Catholic population that has opposed the law, as recent weeks have shown.
Some protesters condemn the law for religious reasons, while some conservatives say that while they support equal rights for gay couples, they do not think that includes the right to marry. Others have protested against allowing gay married couples the right to adopt and raise children.
Also Sunday, a lesbian love story by Abdellatif Kechiche won Cannes film festival's top honor, the Palme d'Or, with the event's director calling on those protesting in Paris to watch the movie.
"Everyone who is against same-sex marriage or love between two people of the same sex must see [Blue is the Warmest Color]," they told Reuters.
Here's a short video, via Agence France-Presse, of Autin and Bruno.

James Kenny, Archaeologist at Chichester District Council, said that it was "a once in a lifetime opportunity for local archaeological volunteers to uncover a find like this."The remains of three Roman buildings were originally identified under Chichester's Priory Park, using ground penetrating radar equipment and a small dig was originally carried out to confirm this.This week's archaeological dig aimed to explore the area in more detail and to uncover the secrets of the third building, which had an unusual shape.The dig has revealed that there were two Roman townhouses on the site - one of which had its own private bath house - which would have been owned by someone of great wealth and importance."This discovery is very exciting," says Cllr Susan Taylor, Cabinet Member for Planning at Chichester District Council."We know that this has created a lot of interest and local residents are intrigued by what has been discovered on their doorstep and so we have enjoyed giving people the opportunity to visit the site and see the discoveries."Chichester's rich Roman history already attracts people from far and wide, due to its city walls and its public Roman Bath House, which is located in our Novium Museum. We hope that these further discoveries will encourage even more people to visit our beautiful city."James Kenny, Chichester District Council's archaeologist, has been working solidly for over a week with the help of Chichester and District Archaeology Society to uncover the secrets beneath Priory Park."What's remarkable about this discovery is that it has survived over 1,000 years in an occupied city. This is because they are under a park that has never been built on," says James."It's almost unique to see Roman remains survive in this type of setting and to be so complete. What we've found is a hot room from a very small, private bath suite that would have gone with an extremely well appointed, luxurious town house. These properties would definitely have been owned by the richest people in the city."The hot room has a hypocaust under it. Hot gases from the fire would have gone under the floor then up through flues in the walls, making this room very hot. It probably would have had a concrete roof on it and in it would have been a hot or warm bath. It would have been part of a series of rooms, including a changing room, a warm room, a hot room, possibly an even hotter room and then into a room with a cold plunge bath. All of these rooms would have been part of a very high status bath suite at the back of a very grand house."The location definitely marks one of the most affluent parts of the Roman Town, with these houses being the equivalent of a property worth millions of pounds in today's society. Only someone who was incredibly wealthy could have owned a bath house like this and paid for it to be maintained. They would have either made their money out of commerce and trading, or were a member of the local aristocracy."We don't know the date of the site yet, but it was probably third or fourth century AD. This was quite late in the history of Roman Chichester - but at the time when it was in its heyday."The scans show that the two houses have walls surrounding complete rooms, which may be set around a courtyard or atrium. There is also a deep masonry building with a rounded end, which we now know is a private bath house."James believes that the houses were originally located on a street, but that this hasn't survived because of the World War Two reservoirs that was built in the park. The scans reveal that another Roman street ran further east under Priory Park, but this will not be uncovered."We now hope to use the evidence that we have gathered to bid for money to fund future excavations, which will focus on one of the town houses," says James."This discovery is a unique part of Chichester's history, and so we've really enjoyed speaking to lots of people who have visited the site to see the dig take place. Chichester has such a wealth of history and so it is great that people are so interested in it."We do not plan to keep the remains on permanent display - when the work has been completed we will return the ground to its current state. Instead, the likelihood is that we will create information that will provide people with all of the information that they need in the long term," they add.
(Reuters) - A California deputy attorney general has been charged with possessing child pornography at their San Diego County home following a months-long investigation, according to court records and local media.
Raymond Liddy, 53, was arrested at their home in the resort city of Coronado, California, on Tuesday and accused of owning images that appeared to depict minors under age 12 engaging in sexual acts, court records showed.
The San Diego Union-Tribune, which first reported the case, said Liddy pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in federal court for the Southern District of California, and that they were placed on administrative leave by the attorney general's office.
An attorney for Liddy and a representative of the attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Court records showed Judge Jan Adler released Liddy on a $100,000 bond and sentenced them to house arrest.
The investigation began in January after the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received tips from an unnamed electronic service provider that a user had allegedly uploaded images of child pornography, court documents said.
Helped by the San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children multi-agency task force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, officials said they identified Liddy as the suspect in June.
The deputy attorney general, who portrayed themselves online as a 48-year-old married man with children, told investigators who visited them in July that they would talk about “sexual fantasies” with individuals on the internet, and that they often saved sexual images, according to court records.
They told investigators they deleted those images afterward, but may also have forwarded some, court records showed. Numerous images depicting minors engaged in sexual acts were found on a computer and a thumb drive at their home, the records showed.
Liddy is due back in court for a preliminary hearing Aug 8.
BBC to Air ‘Muslim Big Brother' Show Featuring Islamic State Defender
The BBC is set to broadcast a two-part ‘Muslim Big Brother' reality TV series featuring a supporter of jailed radical cleric Anjem Choudary who has defended Islamic State and was involved with the banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun.
Muslims Like Us, to be aired on BBC2 on Monday night, is described as a “social experiment” and features a “diverse” group of British Muslims living together in a house. It was made by Love Productions, who were also behind Benefits Street and The Great British Bake Off.
The BBC said the show showcased “topical, important and, at times, charged exchanges shin[ing] a light on what it means to be a Muslim in modern Britain” in a statement.
One housemate is the convicted fraudster, retired professional boxer and terrorist sympathiser Anthony Small – now known as Abdul-Haqq – who the BBC said “represent[s a] voice” within the British Muslim population.
They were arrested in Dover in 2014 and was later charged with plotting to go to Syria to fight with Islamic State after spreading terrorist material online.
Earlier in the year, they had released a video online defending the terror group, describing the execution of American journalists as “retaliation” and denying the jihadists had massacred non-Muslims and Yazidis.
Mr. Small was also a follower of the radical cleric Anjem Choudary (who is currently imprisoned for encouraging support for Islamic State) and appeared at rallies held by their Al-Muhajiroun/Islam4UK group – a Salafi jihadi network banned in 2010.
They attended a protest organised by the group in 2010, after it was banned, where placards saying “British soldiers go to hell” were seen and chants such as “Murderers” and “Baby killers”, directed at British servicemen, were heard.
Islamist sympathising blogger Dilly Hussain revealed on Facebook that they were “initially ‘scouted' and later invited to feature in this programme”, but eventually declined.
Other housemates include “liberal” Muslims, a part-time model, a comedian, and gay Muslim man.
Fatima Salarie, a senior commissioning editor for the BBC, defended the decision to include Mr. Small, explaining that they accurately represented the views of some British Muslims.
“We realised we had to represent this voice because it does exist within the Muslim community, and it would have been wrong to pretend it doesn't or fail to address it,” they told The Guardian.
Series producer Mobeen Azhar added: “We wanted to tap into the conversations happening within the Muslim community and their struggle to define what it means to be a British Muslim.
“Many Muslims feel they are in the spotlight and have to justify themselves constantly. We explore the diversity within the community and issues such as race and sexuality, but in a very raw, human way.”
Dear Blue Pillers and people wanting to get married,
We all know marriage is a raw deal for men and perhaps many of us were drawn to the Red Pill or MGTOW in some form or fashion because we saw female nature and understood it or at least experienced it.
But even when you consider the rosy blue pill dream of a marriage with the woman you love, you can still derive the conclusion that marriage is still bad and you shouldn't do it if you just put a few moments of thought into it. We can prove this using Blue Pill logic and reasoning (and some science) without having to apply any Red Pill thinking.
Out of the line of reasoning is anything related to “female nature”, “hypergamy”, the “state (i.e. courts favoring the women in custody, etc.)”, and so on. Anything in the side bar, we can throw out and we'll still arrive at the conclusion that you shouldn't get married.
The average person wants to get married with a woman they love. Already, making a lifetime commitment based on temporary emotions should be a huge flag for irrational behavior. As science or any history of having a “crush” on someone will tell you, these feelings are merely temporary. The technical term for those “butterflies in your stomach” or a “crush” is “limerence” which has been recognized as a transient state of mind that only lasts 18 months to 3 years. In other words, the emotions you feel towards a person will only last for approximately that time. And you want to make a lifetime commitment based on something that everyone knows to be temporary?
Historically speaking, marriage was a contract for financial security but that's wading into a pool of Red Pill knowledge I'm trying to avoid. Let's just say for now that temporary emotions shouldn't be a basis for a long term commitment.
So…. maybe your idea of a marriage doesn't just depend on love. Maybe it also depends on something else you two share. Well, people change. Whatever you two have may not be there 10 years down the road. The people you're with, the things you like may change as well and you won't be the same person 10 years later. You might mature, slow down, and desire stability in life and they probably won't like you anymore. They might still want to be on that emotional rollercoaster because it gives them something to talk about and adds spice into their life.
Are you prepared for that possibility? And are you capable of accepting the worst case scenario: divorce and them taking half your assets? If you're not prepared, much like many decision people make in life, you shouldn't do the action. Namely, you shouldn't get married.
No matter if you're Red Pill or Blue Pill, you can fundamentally understand that if you're making a choice, you accept the consequences of that choice for better or for worse. While it is rational to dodge responsibility because it is just a liability when the consequences are negative, a decent human being knows how to accept it.
And it is at this point if you cannot accept responsibility for your own actions and decisions, nothing anyone says will convince you of anything so why are you reading this?
Finally, maybe you're utterly convinced that this will never happen to you. That you're special. That's a nice ego you have there but really, at that point, if you're thinking you're special in every regard and you can disregard facts because they don't apply to you, then no amount of reasoning can ever help you. You're trapped in your own emotions and ego that you actually deserve whatever comes your way.
So in conclusion, no matter how you look at marriage, you should understand that marriage is still a choice, not a responsibiltiy. You therefore bear the responsibilty of making that choice. If you believe you're in that 1 out of a million who can make it work, then go for it because nothing anyone says will convince you anyway. But for those on the fence and still thinking about it, just be prepared for the consequences.
We'll be sitting on the sidelines watching you guys burn your own lives.
Stephen Parry told senior colleagues about dual citizenship concerns months ago
Updated
Stephen Parry confided they might have a dual citizenship problem to senior colleagues including Cabinet minister Mitch Fifield months ago, but the ABC can reveal a colleague advised them not to raise the alarm.
Key points: Parry is understood to have raised their citizenship concerns with a Cabinet minister in August
 They are believed to have been told not to go public based on advice Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan would be fine
Malcolm Turnbull criticised Parry for not speaking up earlier
Mr Parry, who on Thursday resigned as Senate president and as a senator for Tasmania following confirmation they were a British citizen, is understood to have raised their potential eligibility problem in mid-August.
That was about the time former Nationals deputy leader Fiona Nash told the Senate their father was born in Scotland, giving their potential eligibility problems.
The ABC understands Mr Parry saw similarities in their own situation and spoke to a Cabinet minister.
This minister is believed to have suggested they not go public because advice from the Solicitor-General was that other Coalition members like Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan would be cleared of citizenship problems.
Senator Fifield has confirmed to the ABC that Mr Parry mentioned to them "a few weeks ago" that they were checking their family history.
"The onus is on all senators and members to satisfy themselves of their circumstances and I encouraged Senator Parry to do so," the Communications Minister said.
"He called me on Monday to say that they had sought advice from the British Home Office and had advised the Attorney-General of this."
When asked about the revelations, Treasurer Scott Morrison told 7.30 they had not had any discussions with Mr Parry about the former senator's potential dual-citizenship.
"I have no idea what that's about," they said.
"I never had any discussion with Stephen about these things. I mean, that's speculation, and people will try to kick up dust about this issue."
Mr Parry's colleagues are stunned they only revealed their own situation this week.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull criticised Mr Parry for not speaking up earlier, saying they were disappointed the former senator did not make the issue public earlier.
"He chose to delay their reporting of it, they should have reported it much earlier and it could have been referred to the High Court together with the other matters that were dealt with, the other citizenship-by-descent cases," Mr Turnbull said.
The ABC understands Mr Parry is upset their integrity has been called into question and angry they are now facing criticism when they were advised not to say anything.
It is understood they feel betrayed and that their reputation is damaged.

Deaths from opioid drug overdoses have hit an all-time record in the U.S., rising 14 percent in just one year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday.
More than 47,000 people died from these drug overdoses last year, the CDC reported.
“These findings indicate that the opioid overdose epidemic is worsening,” the CDC's Rose Rudd and colleagues wrote in their report.
“The increasing number of deaths from opioid overdose is alarming,” said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden.
“Since 2000, the rate of deaths from drug overdoses has increased 137 percent."
“The opioid epidemic is devastating American families and communities. To curb these trends and save lives, we must help prevent addiction and provide support and treatment to those who suffer from opioid use disorders,” they added.
“This report also shows how important it is that law enforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, illegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.”

The CDC is embroiled in a big fight over how to do this. It proposed new draft guidelines this month that include using every other possible approach to managing pain before giving someone an opioid such as fentanyl or oxycontin to control pain.
This wouldn't apply to terminally ill cancer patients and the proposed guidelines would be voluntary. But the pushback has been hard from patients, doctors and the drug industry, as well as groups such as the U.S. Pain Foundation and the American Academy of Pain Management.
“Those of us with chronic disabling illnesses such as lupus (which I have); RA (rheumatoid arthritis), Osteoarthritis (which I have); MS (multiple sclerosis) and all the others survive and function daily because we are able to manage our medications,” one woman wrote in comments posted to the federal website.
“I am told to move and be active, but in order to be active many days, I need the additional help of my opioid medication that my dr. has prescribed. If my Dr. trusts my frequency of use through our appointments why are we considered criminals? If Aleve or Tylenol or aspirin were effective, we would not have had to have treatment with these drugs.”
On January 14, 1918—six years before they began the world's first experiments with liquid fuel rockets—Robert H. Goddard wrote an essay called "The Ultimate Migration." They asked a friend to keep it in their safe, hidden in a sealed envelope labeled "Outline of Certain Notes on High-Altitude Research."
Illustration, "Exploring Harpalus," by Chesley Bonestell
In this secret document, Goddard said they "speculated as to the last migration of the human race, as consisting of a number of expeditions sent out into the regions of thickly distributed stars, taking in a condensed form all the knowledge of the race, using either atomic energy or hydrogen, oxygen and solar energy… [It] was contained in an inner envelope which suggested that the writing inside should be read only by an optimist."

It would not appear in print until November 1972. In four pages of handwritten manuscript, Goddard considered the eventual abandonment of the solar system by humanity "when the sun and the earth have cooled to such an extent that life is no longer possible . . ."
"Will it be possible," Goddard asked, "to travel to the planets which are around the fixed stars, when the Sun and the Earth have cooled to such an extent that life is no longer possible on the Earth?" Goddard hoped that the discovery of "intra-atomic energy" would be the key. And if this proved to be impossible, they thought it might "be possible to reduce the protoplasm in the human body to the granular state, so that it can withstand the intense cold of interstellar space." Bodies would have to be freeze-dried first, "before this state could be produced. Awakening may have to be done very slowly." Goddard suggested that a special breed of human might be deliberately created specifically for this purpose.

And if reducing humans to a powder isn't feasible, Goddard thought that "granular protoplasm," might be launched into interstellar space, "this protoplasm being of such a nature as to produce human beings eventually, by evolution."
If "intra-atomic energy" could be harnessed, interstellar "transportation can be a comparatively simple matter." Near-light speeds would result in "a reasonably short trip." For the spacecraft, Goddard thought that "an asteroid or a small moon" might be adapted. But after a journey lasting generations, what finally arrived at the destination might not be fully human. "There is the possibility," Goddard wrote, "that after many thousands of years, the characteristics and natures of the passengers might change, with the succeeding generations."
And if nuclear power proves impossible, humankind would have to fall back on chemical fuels or solar sails. Flights to distant stars, however, might take thousands or even millions of years. The pilot of such a ship, Goddard suggested, "should be awakened, or animated, at intervals, perhaps of 10,000 years for a passage to the nearest stars, and 1,000,000 years for great distances, or for other stellar systems." A radium-powered alarm clock would be used for this. Energy for the various operations of the ship would be produced by "radioactivity, rather than, say by super-conductors, or by chemical substances that might change with time. Probably most chemical substances would remain very inert at the low temperature of space."

And where would Goddard's colonists go? "The most desirable destination would be near a large sun or twin suns," they thought, "on a planet like the Earth." A planet would be selected that was in as stable an environment as possible, so that the human race could continue its evolution. And a destination would be chosen from that "part of the sky where the stars are thickly clustered, so that further migration would be easy..."
"With each expedition," they wrote, "there should be taken all the knowledge, literature, art (in a condensed form), and description of tools, appliances, and processes, in as condensed, light, and indestructible a form as possible, so that a new civilization could begin where the old ended."
Will this ever happen? Goddard thought so. "The only barrier to human development," they were convinced, "is ignorance, and this is not insurmountable."

Meet the car you can drive with your eyes closed. This otherwise anonymous-looking Audi sedan will slam the brakes and call the police if you fall asleep at the wheel. It's an experimental vehicle for now, but is yet another critical step towards the automation of the automobile. Experts predict drivers could be redundant by 2030.
The latest technology can already steer around bends, keep you wandering from your lane, automatically creep forward in stop-start traffic without needing to touch the pedals -- and brake suddenly if you're about to rear-end the car in front. But hi-tech cars dotted with cameras, lasers, radars and ultrasonic sensors have created a new dilemma for the car industry. Those inventing the technology are worried drivers might fall asleep if there's nothing for them to do.
Audi was so concerned that it did a study to find out how long it takes drivers to regain control of a car if they fall asleep; most responded in 3.5 seconds and the longest took 8 seconds. Its latest experimental vehicle can read the road and the traffic ahead without the driver having to touch the steering wheel or the pedals.
Audi installed an anti-fatigue camera under the rear-view mirror to detect when the driver nods off. If there is no reaction after a five-second warning beep, the car will come to a stop 10 seconds after the system spots drowsy or closed eyes.
“If you're not awake after 10 seconds, there's got to be something wrong,” said Dr Bjorn Giesler, the project manager for Audi's automated cars during a demonstration on the streets of Las Vegas during this week's Consumer Electronics Show. “If you haven't taken control after 10 seconds, the car is going to come to a complete stop and the system is calling the cops.”
Audi is keen to introduce this system in the next two or three years, but its biggest hurdle may be changes to the road rules. A convoy of police cars had to accompany the prototype car, and only qualified engineers were allowed behind the wheel.
Across town, German rival BMW demonstrated an autonomous car on a race track. Without driver input the car took inch-perfect lines, swerved through a slalom, and even did a perfect “drift” (a rear-wheel skid made famous by the movie Fast and the Furious) lap after lap. BMW says it won't introduce drifting technology on its cars but wanted to show how far the technology has progressed.
A year ago, the computer power to run Audi's experimental car took up the entire boot; the latest version has a brain the size of a lap-top and processes 2.5 billion bits of information per second. With improvements in technology, Dr Giesler says the complete automation of the automobile is only a matter of time.
“How long before we are in the cities (with partial autonomous technology)? I'd say 2025,” said Dr Giesler. “How long before we can actually handle all of city traffic without any human intervention? I'd say 2030 or 2040. City traffic is just so, so complex that's there's always going to be a situation where the driver needs to come back to the driving task. I don't think (technology) can handle everything the city can throw at you right now. That's going to take a long time.”
Here now:
Radar cruise control, maintains a safe distance between the car ahead and matches the speed accordingly;
Automatic braking from freeway speeds -- and acceleration back up to traffic and freeway speeds -- when radar cruise control is activated;
Emergency braking at speeds up to 50km/h, designed to stop rear-end collisions if the driver is distracted;
Lane-wander alert, vibrates the steering wheel and/or seat cushion if the driver changes lanes without indicating;
Lane-keeping: corrects the steering and/or applies the brakes on one side of the car to pull it straight.
What's next:
By 2020:
Pedestrian-detection technology, using cameras and/or radar sensors to spot moving objects before slamming the brakes. (As a back-up, Volvo has already introduced the world's first pedestrian airbag under the bonnet near the windscreen.)
Volvo is also developing animal-detection technology. Once it perfects the system on large, slow-moving animals (such as a moose, horse or cow) it has set itself a challenge to spot jumping kangaroos.
A display that counts down how long it takes for red lights to turn green -- thus improving traffic flow. To save petrol, the system restarts the engine five seconds before it's time to go;
A display that tells you the optimum speed to get a green-light run all the way to work (hint: it's less than the posted limit).
By 2025:
Cars that can change lanes and merge safely on and off freeway approach and departure ramps;
Cars that can “valet” park themselves -- as in, without a driver behind the wheel. Tap a button on your mobile phone app and the car will park itself after dropping you at the front door of the shopping centre, for example. It will come back and get you once you're done. (Needs car park infrastructure that can communicate with the vehicle and work with the car's sensors that can detect parking spaces, other moving vehicles and pedestrians).
By 2030:
Completely autonomous cars that can communicate with traffic lights, “read” stop signs, and “talk” with other cars (For example, it will know if another car is about to run a red light and slow you down to avoid a collision). The world's biggest automotive companies signed an agreement in Las Vegas this week to come up with a common system for “car-to-car” communication.
There are A LOT of good reasons why oil prices are going up. Let me show you just a few.
Nope, it is just too convenient, too irresistible and, let's say it, too comfortable an excuse that speculators are to blame. It's not our fault, we have our scapegoat. Our price increases are temporary, we'll soon be back to "normal" lower prices, as soon as (take your pick) speculators have been punished/oil companies are taxed for their profiteering/"fundamentals" are left to set prices.
Never mind that speculators have been caught shortselling oil (ie betting on a fall in prices) more than a few times in recent months. Never mind that spot oil prices, which require actual physical deliveries of oil at the end of each month, have behaved the same way as paper futures. Never mind that oil storage seems to not be increasing.
1)
One you've probably heard by now is the "risk premium", linked to the prospect of a war with Iran. Let me explain how that works.
Say that the market price for oil, if there were no prospect of war with Iran whatsoever, were $100 per barrel.
Say that the market price for oil, should there be an attack on Iran, is estimated at $400/bl (because of production disruption in Iran itself, possibly a blockade of the Straits of Hormuz, etc...)
Say that the probability of such an attack is estimated, by markets, at 10% this year.
In that case, the price for oil will be 90%x100+10%x400 = 130$
A 10% probability of war with Iran which would tentatively quadruple oil prices increases the market price by 30%. Now you may quibble with the estimates I've provided here - but the point is, the market will sum up all the various hypotheses made by all players in that game into a single price, which will reflect the combination of war premium, and war probability that the market, as a whole, includes in the price.
So it is very much possible that 20-40$ in the current price are linked to worries about war. But speculators, here, are actually providing a valuable service: by betting on oil prices (in both directions), they allow all players to hedge that risk of war. Those that think war is more likely will be happy to buy oil futures at prices they think are very low; those that think that war is unlikely and that there is too much of a premium will be happy to sell futures into that market.
While this may create an increase in prices, it would only reflect the reality that a war with Iran would have consequences, and that it's not completely unlikely yet. However, I'd note that futures do not seem to change much in 2009 compared to 2008: so either the markets don't actually think that Obama will be elected, or they don't seem to think that it will have a material impact on the probability for war. Or there is no war premium now, and we're back to square one.
2) Chinese growth
This one has also been widely discussed, so I presume most of you are familiar with it. Still, a few graphs are worth showing here:
As discussed on Casey Research, China is enjoying staggering growth rates for car ownership.
Assuming that the 7.3 million new car owners in 2008 each drive 5,000 miles a year, and they achieve 40 miles per gallon, the result would be an additional 45.6 million barrels of crude demand, equivalent to 125,000 bbl/day. In other words, new Chinese drivers will devour 25-30% of the recently promised Saudi production increase in a single year.
Looking at this over a few years (from the International Energy Agency (pdf):
The lighter blue bit is mostly diesel. Note that 2007 consumption was 347 million tons, ie 7mb/d.
To put this in another perspective again (from Net Oil Exports):
Chinese growth in consumption dwarfs by far the declines noted in rich world countries like Japan, Germany and, yes, the USA (note that the decline in the US is still a lot smaller in absolute terms than those in much smaller economies in Europe or Japan).
So: Chinese demand growth is very real, it's very large, it's highly likely to continue for a number of years (when people finally reach the car affordability stage, they're not going to be stopped by the cost of fuel - not for a while anyway. The difference between no car and a car is so massive that the price of gas is a minor consideration - especially when gas prices are still subsidized...). and it certainly has an impact on oil prices by its sheer size, given the current stagnation of oil production.
3) Saudi numbers
The previous two graphs, and this one above (from the IEA again (pdf), provide interesting information regarding oil producers: not only is their production stagnant, but their consumption is going up massively. And it's no wonder: they're flush with money, gas is heavily subsidized at home, so people drive more and more. Thus, the biggest increases in oil demand, beyond the "usual suspects" of China and India are almost all big oil producers: Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Russia, UAE. If you look over a slightly longer period, you'll also find Iran and Canada in there.
Which means that volumes available for export, and thus volumes available on the global oil market, are shrinking (from Net Oil Exports again):
The numbers don't lie (from westexas [ed: the table was actually provided by datamunger]):
The only major producers which have increased exports lately are Angola and Russia, and Russian production is now declining (while consumption is booming). The conclusion is simple: there is less and less oil on the market for us.
4) Production declines
Beyond Russia, it is striking to note how many regions we have been relying on are experiencing absolute production declines. All mature fields have a natural decline rate, and whole provinces are seeing absolute declines in their production.
This is nowhere as spectacular - and worrisome - as in Mexico, where the supergiant Cantarell field has lost close to half its production capacity in the very recent past, thus threatening exports to the US from a (relatively) friendly neighbor: (from here)
Just like the decline of the North Sea seems to have caught the UK government unaware, and is leading to quasi-panicky behavior by the UK government (which one day blames the Russians, one day wants to go all nuclear, one day wants to go all-wind, and generally blames "uncompetitive" continental Europe for its plight rather than its own policies, or lack thereof), the brutal decline of the Cantarell field, and of overall Mexian production is likely to have brutal consequences, as the country loses its main source of exports and the Mexican government its main source of tax income. Social unrest, and massive migration toward the North could be one outcome...
5) Lack of spare capacity
But let's come back to the oil market for a second: you have a combination of still strong demand growth (in particular in oil producing countries) and stagnant production combining into shrinking export capacity and, more importantly, into a quasi-permanent lack of spare capacity (from this comment by SamuM in a recent thread):
The significance of such tightness of supply cannot be overstated. In normal times, when demand varies, market equilibrium is reached by adjusting production to such demand, which is a relatively easy and cheap process. But when supply is constrained, as it is now, any brutal change in the market (whether on the demand side, for instance through a cold spell in winter requiring more heating, or a hot spell in summer requiring more AC, or on the supply side, for instance guerilla attacks in Nigeria, a refinery strike in Scotland, or a pipeline accident anywhere) will require market equilibrium to be reached by demand destruction, which is a lot harder and triggers much more substantial price movements: prices need to move high enough for some users of oil to renounce such use and "take their demand out of the market", whether by not doing what they wanted to, or by finding a substitute. In the US, people travelling less for vacations, or carpooling, have barely managed a couple percent demand destruction. Imagine that the Saudis and Venezualeans, with their subsidized prices, are immune fro msuch pressure, and that several percent need to be cut off demand abruptly: it will require much higher price hikes than have been experimented yet.
It's simple really: price will go high enough for the pain to translate into lower oil use in price-sensitive countries, the list of which is topped by the US, where consumption is high, oil price variations are not dampened by massive taxes (prices going from $3.50 to $4 is more painful than prices going from $8.50 to $9).
The lack of spare capacity certainly explains why very small variations in output or demand can have disproportionate impacts on prices: when you are right on the edge of the knife, any movement can make you fall off.
6) Refining issues
I thought I'd add just a few words on refining capacity in the US, as it is often blamed for gas prices as well.
Energy information Agency data shows that refining capacity has gone up in recent years even though no refineries were built, with refinery capacity use very stable at high levels. This has not changed much in the past 2 years, even as Katrina took its toll for a while.
And as the tables that are provided on a monthly basis by Californian authorities show (see 2008 numbers and 2007 numbers), refining margins are actually a lot lower this year than last (roughly down from a dollar per gallon to half a dollar per gallon) and have helped lower the impact of oil price increases in the past few months. So you certainly can't blame refiners this year, even though global capacity is tightening:
Altogether, it appears that they are a number of factors explain oil price increases perfectly well, with no need to go into conspiracy theories or market manipulations.
raphic shows results of GenForward poll on younger Americansâ€™ attitudes toward health care coverage; 2c x 4 inches; 96.3 mm x 101 mm;
WASHINGTON (AP) — Most young Americans want any health care overhaul under President Donald Trump to look a lot like the Affordable Care Act signed into law by their predecessor, President Barack Obama.
But there's one big exception: A majority of young Americans dislike “Obamacare's” requirement that all Americans buy insurance or pay a fine.
A GenForward poll says a majority of people ages 18 to 30 think the federal government should be responsible for making sure Americans have health insurance. It suggests most young Americans won't be content with a law offering “access” to coverage, as Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed in doomed legislation they dropped March 24. The Trump administration is talking this week of somehow reviving the legislation.
Conducted Feb. 16 through March 6, before the collapse of the GOP bill, the poll shows that 63 percent of young Americans approve of the Obama-era health care law. It did not measure reactions to the Republican proposal.
The most popular element of the law is allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, which is favored by 75 percent of 18-30 year olds. It's not just that they personally benefit — an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in January found that provision was equally popular among all adults. That proposal was included in the failed GOP overhaul.
But the Republican plan also contained provisions that most young Americans — the racially diverse electorate of the future — do not support, according to the poll. Two-thirds of young people agree with a smaller majority of Americans overall that the government should make sure people have health care coverage. And they understand that will cost more: Sixty-three percent want the government to increase spending to help people afford insurance.
Those feelings cut across racial lines and include most whites, who formed the base of Trump's political support in the presidential election.
“I do believe the government should offer it because we pay taxes,” said Rachel Haney, 27, of Tempe, Arizona. “I do feel like it's a right.”
GenForward is a survey of adults ages 18 to 30 by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the AP-NORC Center. The poll pays special attention to the voices of young adults of color, highlighting how race and ethnicity shape the opinions of a new generation.
Only about a quarter of young people want “Obamacare” repealed. That includes 16 percent of young adults who want it repealed and replaced as Trump has vowed and another 10 percent who want it repealed without a replacement.
Just over a third of young whites want to see the law repealed, making them more likely than those of other racial and ethnic groups to say so.
“He just wants to protect us from al-Qaida, and terrorism,” said Kervin Dorsainvil, 18, a computer technician from Port Charlotte, Florida. “I feel like health care should be much higher on the list. I feel like we have the resources, the medical technology and everything in place to provide the health care to the people. So why wouldn't we do that?”
Young people are more likely than Americans overall to say the government should make sure people have health care. A recent AP-NORC poll of U.S. adults, conducted during and after the collapse of the GOP proposal, found just 52 percent called it a federal government responsibility to make sure all Americans have coverage.
Despite their overall approval of “Obamacare,” young Americans' views on the law aren't all rosy. Just a third say the law is working relatively well, while another third think the health care policy has serious problems. About 2 in 10 consider the law to be fatally flawed.
The law's requirement that all Americans buy insurance or pay a fine is opposed by 54 percent of young people and favored by just 28 percent.
On the other hand, 71 percent favor the law's Medicaid expansion, 66 percent of young adults favor the prohibition on denying people coverage because of a person's medical history, 65 percent favor requiring insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control, 63 percent favor requiring most employers to pay a fine if they don't offer insurance and 53 percent favor paying for benefit increases with higher payroll taxes for higher earners.
About a quarter of young adults say they personally have insurance through their parents, while another 1 in 10 have purchased insurance through an exchange.
___
The poll of 1,833 adults age 18-30 was conducted using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The survey was paid for by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago, using grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Ford Foundation.
Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.

We all want the best for our children, and mothers specifically hope their daughters achieve greater success in their lives than they themselves were able to. My daughter knows they can be whatever they want to be, but ideally, that will be a straight, white man. Life is hard, but it's certainly less hard for straight, white men, and I want my female child to experience all the power, undue confidence, and ease that comes with it.
Think of all the opportunities she'll have available to her! Anytime they ride on public transportation, they can take up three seats to comfortably spread their legs, allowing them undeniably large balls to breathe. No other rider would dare question this position either, and instead find another seat to squeeze into.
She'll be able to walk alone anywhere, at any time, never fearing for their life. What woman can say that? None. And frankly, if rape has to exist in this world, I'd like them to be the one doing it, instead of on the receiving end. I wouldn't want something minor like sexual assault to ruin their future by mentally, emotionally and physically scarring them for the rest of their life. Instead, their punishment of a slight slap of the wrist won't leave a real mark. Them future will remain bright and unscathed.
As a straight, white male, their romantic relationships will never been shunned. Heck, they probably won't even know what a hate crime is, since it's impossible for one to be committed against them That's the kind of assurance I, as their mother, need to know once my baby bird has left the nest.
I'll never need to worry about whether or not she's earning a salary commensurate with their experience, or if they have easy access to abortions. And since straight, white men have so many opinions on the reproductive rights of women, I'd prefer one of those people be my daughter.
As a straight white male, she'll float through life with confidence and ease. She'll do what they please, never self-doubting before speaking or acting out. As a woman, I can only dream of such freedom. And think of all the lucky women who will be on the receiving end of their dick pics! The internet is certainly a man's world, and if they decide they hate a female gamer or Leslie Jones, I know they will have their voice heard all over Reddit.
What mother wouldn't want such an outspoken, opinionated daughter?
I only want the best for my daughter, and as a straight, white man, she'll be set for life, reaping the benefits that all straight, white men undoubtedly deserve–but rarely, if ever, earn on their own. The world is a dark, scary place, but I know my daughter will rise above it all, and I excitedly look forward to the straight, white man they will become.

The mayor of a town in California's Central Valley has sparked outrage by suggesting that bullying victims need to "grow a pair" and stand up to their tormenters on their own.
As Fresno-based ABC affiliate KFSN reported last week, Porterville Mayor Cameron Hamilton made the controversial remarks while discussing a proposal to create a safe zone for bullied students.
"I'm against bullying, but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything and the ills of the world," Hamilton said during a recent city council meeting. "All most people have to do is grow a pair and stick up for them damn selves."
"It is hard to stand up and 'grow a pair' when you're maybe a 10-year-old little girl," city councilwoman Virginia Gurrola, a supporter of the safe zone effort, countered.
"Then maybe the other 10-year olds that think they want to stop bullying will stand up for them instead of a safe zone wtih a placard," Hamilton replied.
The safe zone project, which had been proposed by students at Porterville's Burton Middle School, has since been withdrawn.
Hamilton defended their remarks Friday, telling the Associated Press that they are not anti-gay, and that they oppose the safe zone because of what they see as potential legal risks.
"The message is, together we can all fight this thing," Hamilton said of the bullying problem.
The small town garnered national attention last year when then-mayor Gurrola was ousted after issuing a proclamation declaring June as LGBT Pride Month -- a proposal that Hamilton says they supported.
"There were a lot of emotions that arose from this, but the end result is that people are talking about the LGBT community in the city of Porterville, and they are getting a better understanding of it," Gurrola told The Huffington Post last year.

If you are a transhumanist, brain-hacker or college student, you might have heard of nootropics. Nootropics, or "smart drugs," are compounds thought to have brain-boosting properties, such as memory enhancement, heightened cognition, or increased focus.
But British transhumanists are fretting that a new UK drug law, set to come into force in April, will outlaw these drugs, many of which are currently legal to sell and possess.
The Psychoactive Substances Act was passed into law at the end of January. Conceived as a tool to do away with so-called "legal highs"—unregulated, ever-changing synthetic compounds that mimic the effects (and sometimes the side effects) of illegal drugs—the law prohibits the production, supply, import, export and in some cases possession of any psychoactive substance, with penalties of up to seven years in prison. It defines illegal psychoactive substances as all those that "by stimulating or depressing the person's central nervous system, [affect] the person's mental functioning or emotional state." Most nootropics, which are often marketed as brain stimulants, would automatically be included in the ban.
"Lots of transhumanists use a lot of nootropics and they're obviously worried"
In a recent statement, the techno-enthusiast Transhumanist Party UK appealed to the government to exempt nootropics from the impending ban.
"Citizens, academics, shift-workers, entrepreneurs and students employ nootropic substances responsibly to aid cognition and modulate mood during times of stress or when peak productivity is required," the statement reads. "By denying citizens easy and legal access to what could be a beneficial intervention, the government will enforce a reduction in 'quality of life.'"
Party spokesperson Dirk Bruere told me in a phone call that the party was also launching an online petition. "Lots of transhumanists use a lot of nootropics and they're obviously worried," they said. "Whoever passed this law is scientifically illiterate."
Another Transhumanist Party representative, Cathy Wang, told me that they feared the new regulation would hamper Britain's potential. "Taking smart drugs off the market will impact this country's creativity," they said.
Nootropics have always existed in a sort of grey area in Britain. As Bruere told me, "most of them are actually prescription medicines for conditions such as narcolepsy, or Alzheimer's, that increase some mental faculties in healthy users."
There are questions around the risks—let alone the efficacy—of taking these drugs recreationally, with some experts warning that while they could help increase short-term focus, they might impair brain functionality in the long term. The only smart drug that, following a 2015 study, was deemed both safe and effective—alertness-enhancer modafinil—is still prescription-only and has been criticised by some commentators as a form of brain doping.
As these medicines are prescription-only, and lack of enhanced intelligence is not considered a medical condition, nootropics fans cannot generally get them on prescription.
That's why until now people who want to legally get their hands on nootropics have often turned to slightly tweaked versions of those medicines, imported from abroad (generally Russia and Eastern Europe) and marketed on British websites, sometimes with "not for human consumption" disclaimers. These psychoactive products aren't approved drugs, but under the existing laws, which regulate drugs substance by substance, they aren't explicitly prohibited either. Their unregulated status made it possible to produce and trade them lawfully.
But the new Act takes a more blanket approach. Rather than prohibiting certain compounds, it will forbid them unless they are explicitly exempted: currently, exempted substances include food, approved medicines, caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine.
An amendment put forward by Chesham and Amersham MP Cheryl Gillan tried to add nootropics to the exemption list, but it was not put to vote; a Home Office spokesperson told me there is no further plan to exempt them as of now. Gillan's assistant said that "she suggested the change after a constituent who sells nootropics got in touch with them  They are not themselves a nootropics user."
British nootropics merchants like Gillian's constituent are in disarray. Duncan Shen, who used to take nootropics as a student and now runs e-commerce website nootropics.co.uk, told me on Skype that he'd have to shut the business down, as they wouldn't be able to sell 90 percent of their stock (the remaining ten percent is comprised of caffeine-based supplements and so won't be affected by the new law).
"A lot of people in the UK will try to buy nootropics, so the only way is going to be using darknet markets"
He's thinking of moving their venture to the US or to a less-restrictive EU country. He's also looking for loopholes to exploit—a "plan B" could be selling DIY kits. "We could sell two chemicals that have no psychoactive effect, until you mix them together," Shen suggested. It's not clear if or how that would be permissible.
What is clear is that nootropics users aren't going to stop because of the ban. According to Shen, right now their website is experiencing a spike in sales, due to people stocking up before the law comes into force.
And April might not be the end of the UK trade. "You're going to have people like us sitting on kilos of nootropics," Shen said. "And a lot of people in the UK will try to buy nootropics, so the only way is going to be using darknet markets. "
"At the moment people selling nootropics are lawful companies; after the [new law comes into force] it'll be shady people."
Others agree that we won't see much of a shift in use of nootropics. Pharmacologist and drug researcher David Nutt, who served on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs from 2008 to 2009 and is an advocate for drug law reform, thinks that the new Act's blanket ban could be just too much to work.
"It's hard to know how it'll ever be enforced: the definition of 'psychoactive' is too vague and there's no way they're going to know for sure if a substance they find is psychoactive," they told me on the phone. "This is just about abating sales and closing head shops. It won't really abate consumption."
In the end, transhumanists might have to wait until public perception around smart drugs changes. Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute researcher Anders Sandberg told me there is a rift between those who think that human brainpower and in general the human body are worth upgrading with whatever means available, and those who think they are not.
"The way to get [nootropics] legal is to convince medical authorities that human enhancement is a valid medical activity: a long-term goal," Sandberg wrote in an email. "In the meantime they will always fall under the misuse of drugs act."
I feel like I need to start this article with a whole load of caveats, but I'll try to avoid that. I apologise in advance for rambles and tangents. Thanks to the stress of supporting Spurs, I, like many of you I'm sure, didn't get much sleep…
Background
I'm regularly asked on Twitter why I ‘defend' Emmanuel Adebayor despite their apparent lack of quality and effort. It is impossible to answer that appropriately in 140 characters so here are some hastily put-together thoughts that have been running through my brain overnight, amidst a barage of online abuse for the Togolese striker.
Firstly , I guess I do find myself defending him. This isn't because I have any particular regard for them as a person or even as a player – they have, in the past, shown signs of being greedy, money-motivated, career-driven, uncaring about their clubs and their fans; in other words, a typical footballer. However, they are also a footballer whose abilities benefited us last season, and should theoretically be able to benefit this season and beyond.
The penalty
Let's not sugar-coat it, it was an awful penalty. They tried to take the unsavable penalty – high and into the corner. They ended up leaning back after a stuttering run up and got under the ball. Is it, as I've heard people say, ‘inexcusable for a professional footballer to miss the target from such close range'? Does this make them a bad player? Of course not. Even Messi missed the target from the penalty spot against Chelsea last season. Clearly, players don't just try to hit the target – they try to place it so far away from the goalkeeper as to make sure of scoring. Did they miss deliberately? Of course not. A man with their ego would love to have scored and been one of the heroes.
Reasons to dislike
The swathe of popular opinion is currently against him, let's make that clear from the outset. He's ex-Arsenal; he's shown signs of being a mercenary in the past (and therefore it's easy to apply this to them now); they don't tear around the pitch like a Scott Parker, a Didier Zokora or a Steffen Freund; instead, they have a languid, laid back style – somewhere between Berbatov and Kanoute – that can be seen as arrogance. Essentially he's pretty easy to dislike, and the above reasons make them an ideal scapegoat for many.
Reasons to like
Last season they excelled. They were a vital player to us – after Kaboul and Modric, they were probably my player of the season. Their goals were vital, their assists were vital, and their all round link play (and understanding with Bale, Modric and Van der Vaart in particular) was vital to our (moderate) success.
This season so far
This season, it's true, they have suffered. Some reasons for this might be:
– a lack of pre-season dues to their protracted transfer (be that due to them holding out for more money or otherwise);
– initially being unable to put together a run of games, due to injury / suspension / Defoe's form;
– playing with Defoe, a player notoriously unable to form partnerships;
– playing without Van der Vaart and Modric, players they so enjoyed playing with last season;
– a lack of confidence caused by all of the above.
The last reason, for me, being the most important. Tellingly, AVB said in the build-up to the Basel game:
“Finding the back of the net allows them to go into the game with more confidence and I always think it's self-belief from the player, rather than anything else that helps them improve.”
Adebayor the player – nuance
It seems an irritatingly snobbish thing to say, but a lot of their good work does go unnoticed.
Fans get frustrated by their indirect play – he's not a player who is constantly in the box poaching, for example. But their hold-up and link play, ability to drift wide (dragging defenders away and creating space for others), and their awareness of their teammates are impressive. They will often be the one to make a run to drag a defender away, which indirectly leads to a goal.
They encourage midfielders into the opposition third by dropping deep and creating a focal point/platform for them to play into, and receive the ball back from. We have seen a lot less of that this season due to the sales of Modric and Van der Vaart. Instead, with Bale playing centrally, we are often more direct and will not build in such a slow, patient way. But last season Adebayor was integral to our possession play in the opposition third, and if we do sign a Moutinho-like player, it is essential that we have someone like Adebayor for them to link with.
The attitude / work rate
Some football fans love players who visibly put effort in – who work hard for their club, and do what we as fans would do as a bare minimum were we ever lucky enough to play for the club we love. It speaks volumes that Scott Parker won our Player of the Year last year: a player who almost has to drag themselves off the pitch every week, such are their endeavours. A player who gained favour by charging around for 90 minutes, winning the ball back and passing it five yards to the supremely-talented Luka Modric (OK, that downplays them a little, but you see my point). Parker, a player whose own limits have been (almost cruelly) exposed this season by the lack of Modric alongside him.
The antithesis of Parker is the ‘lazy', uncaring Adebayor.  They are not a player to try to rush defenders by pressing them at every opportunity or chase back into midfield if he's not successfully in retaining possession. But how many strikers are? And do we want them to be? There MUST be a balance between the above, and conserving energy for other areas of the game.
Of course that totally ignores the other types of effort that often go unseen: movement off a defender to show for the ball, movement into the channels to drag defenders around and create space for others, the strength and endurance of constantly holding off brawny defenders.
I'm not saying he's a workhorse and that people just don't notice it – of course there are harder working forwards who visibly ‘put more effort it', to put it simply – but to call them lazy is, in my opinion, unjustified and short-sighted.
Worst striker, etc
I've seen it said on Twitter and on forums that Adebyor the worst striker we've had in recent seasons. Have we improved so much that we have forgotten some of the dross in our recent past? Our current squad is probably one of the most, if not the most talented we've had in my lifetime (I'm not yet thirty), and Adebayor is certainly not one of the worst players within it.
They have played for Monaco, Arsenal, the modern-day Manchester City and Real Madrid. Were they to leave, it would almost certainly be to a club participating in the Champion's League.  They are a very talented player – they may not have a skill-set that tallies with what some fans want to see in a forward, but to criticise their technical ability and all-round game is pretty ludicrous, in my opinion. By all means have an opinion about what you want to see from our forwards, what you want to see them do more or less of, but worst striker in x years? Really? It's also important to look beyond form – all players have ups and downs, just look at fan-favourite Defoe, who seems to suffer from dips in form more than most. Or more recently Jan Vertonghen, who was absolutely outstanding in March, but has had a pretty appalling April so far.
Agendas
Of course, most football fans will, knowingly or unknowingly, have agendas. If I'm honest, my own is based on youth players; because I follow the youth teams, I like to see products of our academy involved in the first team squad. Rightly or wrongly, I call for them to be involved (be it from the start of games or from the bench) on more occasions than other fans might. For example, I have frequently called for Tom Carroll to be involved in games when others might not think they are ready yet.
Many fans seem to have an unwavering agenda with regards to Adebayor. For years they were the unfortunate victim of a deeply unpleasant song, shamefully sung by a section of our fans – they were a hate figure, as they played for the enemy. Some fans would simply never take to him, simple. However, the level of negativity towards them – even after a successful first season is confusing – particularly when the leeway offered by fans to similarly under-performing players is clear to see.
Defoe and Acebayor have a similar scoring record since the turn of the year, but whilst Defoe's name is still sung out even when they are sat in the bench, Adebayor's name is sometimes booed when read out by the stadium announcer prior to matches.
Clearly Defoe has earned affection – scoring regularly over a lengthy spell at the club, and showing what appears to be a genuine passion for THFC. On the other hand, Adebayor is perceived as a mercenary who stops trying after becoming too comfortable at hus clubs – or so the press' narrative would have us believe. And so it goes – agendas are built on perception, a player's lack of confidence is perceived as not trying, and the vicious circle continues.
The future
As mentioned, I have no attachment to Adebayor as a player or person and, so long as we replaced them adequately, I couldn't care less if they were to leave in the summer. In fact, I think it's probably for the best that they do, such is the job in ‘convincing' our fans that they would have ahead of them were they to stay.
I just hope that we aren't cutting off our nose to spite our face. Were we to sign a Moutinho type or a van der Vaart type, we may end up greatly missing a technically-gifted forward who can play one and two touch passing football, bring talented attacking midfielders into play, and who has the ability and intelligence to draw defenders out wide and create space for others.
Support
The negativity towards Adebayor (I heard boos when their name was read out at Swansea – I thought our away fans were meant to be steadfastly supportive?) is, in my opinion, depressing.
More so because it is so obvious to me that Adebayor is a confidence player – a player who is bubbly, bright, and plays well when their metaphorical tail is up, and who suffers when things are not going so well – on or off the pitch. To get the best out of him, we need to get behind him. Can I see that happening? Unfortunately not.
We all want what is best for Tottenham Hotspur – we just have different opinions on how we achieve it. Even if you disagree with my opinion that Adebayor is a player affected by confidence, and instead think that they are an arrogant mercenary, consider whether you think that moaning, groaning, booing and jeering has any chance of helping them improve their form. Alternatively, what if I'm right? What if our collective support can help to get an extra 5% out of him? What have we got to lose?
This seems a good time to mention the 1882 event coming up. If you fancy being a part of a crowd who will sing for the lilywhite shirt of Tottenham Hotspur, regardless of whether the player in it is Ledley King, Emmanuel Adebayor, or Kenneth McEvoy (who?), then you should read this, and come along to watch our U21s take on Arsenal at Underhill.
COYS.
New York is filled with ghost signs for store that have long departed an address. Yet the new shop owners never remove the old signage, giving the old businesses a phantom presence on city streets.
The liquors sign above is at Avenue A and 14th Street. As you can see, there's no corresponding liquor store, just a nail salon and a karaoke bar.
When this pizza joint on West 18th Street pulled up stakes, the Persian restaurant that moved in didn't mind the green Pizza Paradise awning. Maybe the Ps made it close enough?
Superbuy was one of the names of an old-school pharmacy that once existed on lower First Avenue across from Stuyvesant Town. The store is gone, but the orange sign remains.
I'm not even sure which of these signs is actually the ghost sign and which represents the business currently occupying this space on West 14th Street!

Your thoughts on advancing to ro8 in first place?
I wasn't able to practise a lot because of some personal matters. So I wasn't expecting to advance in first place which makes me even happier that I did. Looking at the rest of the bracket, it seems like I can get to the finals with no problem.
You are doing rather well lately.
I lose often in practice at the moment but I feel like I'm invincible on the stage. That's why I think it's time for another championship. If I stay the way I am, this season is mine.
The finals are in your hometown so doesn't that motivate you even more?
When I heard, I told myself that I had to get to the finals no matter what. Ro16 was the hardest step and since I'm advancing in first place, I should be able to get to the finals no matter what. The only thing I need to think about now is the finals in my hometown.
It wasn't on easy group so how did you prepare for it?
I was very confident in ZvT. So even I knew that I could advance through the final match even if I lost to Nestea in the winner's match.
You had a very long game against Ryung.
I had a very sloppy first battle so got backed into a corner. I wasn't able to spend my resources after some tight battles so my composition was ruined. Ryung is a great player so I prepared specifically for them but they surprised me by blocking all my moves.
You faced Nestea in the winner's match.
I feel like I play faster lately. So I thought I'd have the upper hand if it got to the late game and strategized around that concept.
You will face Naniwa in ro8
I can do whatever I want and still win. That's all I have to say.
GSTL and GSL are being held in Busan.
This is my one chance to be in both the individual and team leagues in my hometown Busan. I think this might be a first and last chance for me as a progamer. I want to win both leagues in style in my hometown.
Anything to add?
I want to thank our sponsor Razer, our partner MYM and people who helped with practice Dream and Sniper. I had a headache at the studio but got better because my coach took great care of me. I want to thank the coach, their family, my girlfriend, my parents, family and last but not least, the fans who cheer for me.

Your thoughts on advancing after some close games?
I'm glad because I haven't been in ro8 in a while. I'm glad to have secured a Code S spot for next season.
Did you intend to rely on TvZ only for your advancement?
Yes, I did. That's why I didn't practise any ZvZ but DRG seemed to have the same idea. I think it was still a good decision.
Did you expect to face DRG in the winner's match?
Somewhat. Even if it were a Terran, I was confident that I would advance to ro8.
You seemed to lose more concentration the longer a game went.
Indeed, I did. Maybe it's because I'm getting older but I had a hard time physically in longer games. However, I tried my best thinking that a loss was not acceptable. I think I'll start exercising from tomorrow to prepare for such lengthy games.
You had some disappointing play such as having idle drones in Set 2 of the final match.
I didn't find out until the match was over. I was playing without any idea of what I was doing.
You did an all-in for the last set of the final match.
I was actually planning to use it for the first map but saved it because I felt I could win with macro on that map. Later, I intentionally chose Daybreak with its long rush distance to use that strategy.
You now have the best of 5 series in store.
I've been looking forward to this. The best of 5 series is much easier to prepare for than the dual tournament.
You face Byun in ro8
Byun is one Terran I really wanted to avoid.  They are exceptionally good. However since it's decided, I hope we have a fun and amazing match.
Are you confident about getting to the finals?
I give myself about 10%. I really want to but can't guarantee it. There are too many great players so I'll just focus on the match at hand.
OSL is starting soon.
I've gotten to the dual tournament stage in Starcraft 1. At the time, I went 0:2 so I want to do well in Starcraft 2. GSL is my top priority but I still want to prepare and perform well.
What are your plans for the future?
I'm planning to skip foreign tournaments for a while. I will focus on Korean tournaments or a month or two. Attending some foreign tournaments early this year took its toll on me.
How do you think you will do in the WCG 2012 qualifiers?
Again I can't be sure because there are too many great players. I think I'll just have to do my best.
Anything to add?
I want to thank Happy for practising with me and also IMHirai. Today's my lovely girlfriend's birthday so I'm sorry that I wasn't able to spend the day with them and I wish to dedicate my victory to them I want to thank them for being so understanding and I want to say that I love them very much. Lastly, I want to thank our sponsors: LG Electronics, Googims, Nvidia, Cocacola and SteelSeries.

Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, U.S. October 21, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Republicans have become much more confident in the US economy since the election of President Donald Trump. And a new poll shows Trump's win may have even changed the way they see the past.
The poll, from the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel showed that by 54 percentage points, GOP voters in Wisconsin believed the economy has gotten "better" over the last 12 months. When asked in October, GOP voters were 28 points more likely to believe it had gotten "worse" over the past 12 months.
The findings aligned with a recent Pew Research Center poll that showed the percentage of Republicans that viewed the economy as in good standing jumped from 31% in early 2016 to 61% in March.
Nothing materially has changed in the US economy since October. Job gains are still solid but not spectacular, wage growth has remained subdued, and industrial production has improved but not by a large margin.
In fact, by most measures, there has been a bit of a lull in economic activity. Core consumer price index inflation showed its first decline since January 2010, retail sales have slipped the past two months, and a variety of "hard data" points have slumped. The consensus for first quarter GDP is below 1% annualized and the Atlanta Fed GDP Now tracker has it pegged at just 0.5%, the lowest in nearly two years.
Funding Axe Falls On
Indigenous Law Centre
April 22, 2014
Australia's only indigenous law research centre, located at the University of NSW, is calling for community support following the Federal Government's decision to cut all its funding.
The Indigenous Law Centre (ILC) — which publishes the Indigenous Law Bulletin (ILB) and the Australian Indigenous Law Review (AILR) — has been in continuous operation since 1981.
The funding, from the Federal Attorney General's Department, pays the wages of editors and other staff members, journal publication costs and public events such as its Open Forums.
Until now, the ILC has received funding from successive Australian governments.
ILC director, Prof Megan Davis, said the need for quality research on indigenous legal matters had never been greater.
“There are many people, including those in the government and public service, who rely on our research and journal publications to inform policies and programs that directly impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,” they said.
“The legal issues affecting indigenous communities are increasingly complex and part of our role is to explain the complexities of these laws in a way the community can easily understand.
“The ILB and AILR are the only journals of their kind in Australia; indeed they are among the few indigenous law journals anywhere in the world. We are strongly committed to ensuring they continue to be published.”
Prof Davis has called on ILC supporters and community members, both indigenous and non-indigenous, to help ensure the survival of the centre.
“There are many ways the community can offer support to the ILC; from making a donation to writing a letter to your local member as to why you think the ILC is important, each action will form part of a much bigger plan to enable the centre continue its important work,” they said.
The ILC continues to receive in-kind support from the UNSW Law School in the form of office space and the voluntary contributions of academic staff.
The centre is now working with the faculty to seek private funding to replace the government funding it has lost.

Police are investigating a stranger rape at gunpoint in St. Paul on Tuesday night and asking anyone with information to come forward.
Officers were patrolling the Payne-Phalen neighborhood about 11:45 p.m. when they saw a woman who was nude run across a street. They went into a yard, where a man — who turned out to be their boyfriend — came out and was comforting them as they screamed and cried hysterically, said Steve Linders, a St. Paul police spokesperson.
The officers asked if the woman was injured or needed medical attention. The 41-year-old told them they had just been raped, and they were taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation.
The woman reported they had been walking on Payne Avenue near Geranium Avenue about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday when a minivan pulled up next to them and the driver asked if they needed a ride. They ignored them and continued walking.
Then, they heard something behind her, turned around and saw the driver was out of the vehicle and following them They motioned with their head toward their hands and they saw they were holding a black semi-automatic handgun, Linders said.
The man told them not to scream or draw any attention to themselves and threatened to shoot them if they didn't do what they instructed.
The man forced them to walk to their minivan, which was parked on Geranium Avenue, and raped them inside the vehicle while threatening them with the gun, Linders said. After the attack, the man drove about half a block and told the woman to get out and not look back.
The suspect is described as a black male, about 6 feet tall, with a medium build. They were wearing a black ski mask, a heavily-worn baseball cap over a stocking cap, black pants and possibly a lighter-colored coat over a sweatshirt.
The vehicle was a newer tan or light-colored minivan with no rust. It had a sliding rear door on each side.
“Police are looking for any information, including surveillance footage, witnesses and certainly the suspect,” Linders said Wednesday.
Anyone with information is asked to call police at 651-266-5685.
Santa is so cool! And talented! And thoughtful!
Santa sent me, so carefully wrapped I might add, some killer 8-bit iron on patches that they made for me themselves. Featured on the front of a handsome drawing pad is the Hyrule logo in all its glory.
Not only did Santa send the beautiful pad, but they also sent three additional iron-on patches. The first is of Link holding the mighty bomb up over their head from the glory days of my childhood (Zelda number 1). The bomb just had to be my favorite weapon, because not only did it kill stuff, it also blew open previously unknown caves and doorways. I used to spend days gathering bombs and walking around trying to discover new places to explore.
Also included were a patch of link thrusting out their basic sword and another of them walking onwards to victory over the evil Ganon.
The New York Knicks are reportedly interested in acquiring disgruntled Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah this summer. Including cap holds, they'll have approximately $25 million in room to spend on free agents, which should be more than enough to afford Noah, a 31-year-old New York City native who only started two games last season.
LRT: If Noah's leaving Bulls, expect Knicks to make a strong pitch. Phil Jackson and Noah have a rapport. And Noah has NY roots. — Howard Beck (@HowardBeck) May 25, 2016
Article continues below ...
But why would they do it? Outside of the fact that he's far too old to make sense as a complementary piece beside Kristaps Porzingis at this stage of Noah's career, he's strictly a center; that's the one position where New York definitely doesn't need any more bodies. Porzingis will likely play a ton at the five this season, and Robin Lopez is under contract until 2019.
The Knicks held opponents to 55.3 percent shooting within five feet of the rim during the regular season, which led the league. They're all set in the front court. Instead, they need a point guard, outside shooting and athletic, adaptable wings who'll let them go small with Carmelo Anthony at the four and Porzingis at the five.
Noah is coming off the most dispiriting season of their career, but combine the rising salary cap with a weak free agent pool and it's easy to imagine a scenario where they command surreal money. New York can always offer a one-year deal for an extremely high amount, but it'd eat up space it should really allocate toward those asupervisorstioned roles.
An unselfish big who knows how to pass is a valuable commodity within the triangle offense, but New York is no longer emboldened to that ideology. Head coach Jeff Hornacek will likely run more spread pick-and-roll in an up-tempo game that prioritizes the three-point line.
Noah isn't the greatest fit in that system. They can't space the floor and isn't a very good finisher in the half-court. On defense, Noah is no longer capable of hedging or trapping screen-and-rolls 28 feet from the basket, then recovering back to their man over and over again throughout a game, let alone an entire season.
Being that the Knicks already have Lopez to sag back and force mid-range jumpers, it's hard to see Noah find minutes in Hornacek's rotation. They aren't washed-up, but New York has no use for what they currently are.
Lead singer of Tool is testing their talent with winemaking
Maynard James Keenan, 42, is all about focus, passion and defying expectations. For example, in 1983 Keenan was a member of the class that entered West Point, the academy that normally produces generals, politicians and CEOs; Keenan became a rock star. As lead singer, he's made six albums with Tool and another three with A Perfect Circle. Not simply content with the 6,000-bottle wine collection stardom has earned him, Keenan is now making their own wine in Cornville, Ariz., near their home. They spoke with Wine Spectator just after they completed a 20-week international tour to promote Tool's latest album, 10,000 Days--right as harvest was underway and just as their winery, Caduceus, was releasing its 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend, Sensei.
Wine Spectator: How did you first get interested in wine?
Maynard James Keenan: Being in an occupation that requires me to travel quite a bit, you're just exposed to more cultural things than you would if you were growing up in the suburbs of Boise, Idaho. When you're drinking warm Coca-Cola and your accountants and managers and booking agents are walking around with these nice glasses with nice red juice in it, you say, 'Hey, that doesn't look like what I've been drinking in the dressing room. What's that? I'm not going on stage unless I get to have what you have.'
WS: How big is your wine collection nowadays?
MJK: I'd guess 6,000 bottles. I always have some staple stuff, and I'm always making sure I'm getting a hold of the newest Penfolds releases. [But] I've basically just been concentrating on making it. That's been taking up most of my time.
WS: What convinced you that you could make the kind of wine you want in Arizona?
MJK: Just having traveled through Australia and seeing the climates and seeing the ground and the soil, parts of Italy, Portugal, Spain and southern France, I started to gather the impression that this kind of looks like where I live in Arizona. 5,000 feet, a little bit of snow in the winter. It gets hot, but not insane Phoenix hot. It just seemed like it was a natural progression.
WS: What were some of the challenges of planting and maintaining your own vineyard?
MJK: So far the biggest challenge we're facing is there's no history here, so we have nothing to draw upon. We're kind of shooting in the dark. There are some pretty extreme temperature swings in parts of the year. Last year on one of our lots we had a drop of 50 degrees overnight--not great when we were still watering. Pretty much fried them out; the vines weren't dormant yet, and couldn't handle it. Pretty much killed half the vineyard. We planted some rows tighter just out of space constraints, for an experiment. Great vigor, kinda kept some of the humidity in. But of course, we get monsoons. As soon as the monsoons hit, those were the first sets of grapes to get bunch rot. There's gonna be a lot of tweaking as time goes on.
WS: Where are you getting most of your fruit from while you wait for your own vineyards to produce?
MJK: My main batch of fruit comes from the Paso Robles, Calif., area. And then some of it comes from the Wilcox area, down in southern Arizona. I enjoy making wine with some of the California grapes, but the plan is to eventually be exclusively Arizona grapes. Eric Glomski [my winemaker] is very seasoned. They worked with David Bruce for many years, and he's from Arizona, and they wanted to get back over here because they recognized the same thing I did about this area: that it has huge potential for growing some pretty intense wines that are stressed out a bit, and have something to say.
WS: How involved are you in the growing and the picking decisions?
MJK: I'm as involved as I can be considering my other career. It's crush right now, and I missed all the Sangiovese inoculation, and most of my Syrah. But I just made it home in time for the Cab. It cooled down in California and I just got off the road two days ago, so I'm going to have all my Cab coming in the next two weeks and I'll get to be here for all that: inoculation, pressing, barreling. I'll be doing it with three or four other people here, not watching somebody do it.
WS: In terms of winemaking and blending, you've made some interesting decisions, like adding a touch of Arizona white wine to your Primer Paso red blend. What do you think is the most unusual yet successful winemaking decision you've made?
MJK: That one, in a way, just because I have to understand that my initial fan base for my wine is people who are interested in my band. Which is not necessarily the best thing, since they're not necessarily seasoned wine drinkers who know what they're drinking. But perhaps their friends are or their parents are, so if I can just get that wine into their hands, it'll grow from there because we're doing some pretty good wines here. That initial Malvasia-Shiraz blend, for me, was the introduction to those people, who don't understand a really complex Burgundy or Bordeaux, or a Cab or Rhône Valley-style blend. Something with a little bit of floral nose on it, that's kind of sweet and you drink it and it has a little wood on it. As far as that experiment, I think the Primer Paso kind of did cross over for some people who normally wouldn't drink wine.
WS: Where are you making the wines?
MJK: I'm in the process of building a fairly small facility. I'm operating under Page Spring Cellars' license, until I get my own permit. I'm doing about 1,200 cases, [and] when I build my own facility I might expand it a little bit. But with my limited experience, there's no possible way I could do anything bigger and babysit all that and really understand what's happening with each batch.
WS: How have the other guys in Tool responded, not just to your wines, but maybe some of the classic ones you've shared with them over the years?
MJK: I kinda tricked them at one point with some Bin 389 from Penfolds. Every night I would have a bottle open and give them a sip. I did that for about a month and a half, and then switched it out with something. Each one of them came up to me individually and said, 'Is this the same thing we've been drinking?' And I said, 'No, see, they're different. Gotcha.' For them, who were claiming they have no palate whatsoever and don't know the difference, even they could tell. It was a good education for them.
WS: Which is harder, getting a band together and making it successful, or starting a winery and making it successful?
MJK: I think if you focus on anything hard enough and really put your heart into it, you can take most things to a certain level, but that last 5 percent of the way, either you're gifted or you're not. I just had a knack for vocals and working together with people to make music. That came naturally to me. The winemaking? I don't know. Time will tell if I have that extra 5 percent. I definitely have the 95 percent focus and passion, so we'll see.
Professor Kancha Ilaiah burst into popular consciousness with their bestseller Why I Am Not a Hindu – A Sudra Critique of Hindutva Philosophy, Culture and Political Economy. Currently the director of the Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, Maulana Azad National Urdu University in Hyderabad, Ilaiah peels away the layers of meanings shrouding the ban imposed on cattle slaughter in some states.
Do you think a ban on beef is a cultural imposition on certain sections of Hindus, Muslims and Christians?
It is definitely a cultural imposition, more particularly on indigenous groups – tribals and Dalits. The question of cultural imposition on Muslims and Christians comes later.
Why do you say that?
Historically, all Indian masses, including the Brahmins, used to eat beef, both in what is called the Vedic and the post-Vedic period. Gautam Buddha rebelled against this tradition because during their time there was a huge consumption of beef by the priestly class. Buddha asked people not to kill cows for sacrifice, not to kill beyond what they needed for consumption. From that stage to the modern period, most of the untouchables, for instance, the Dalits in south India, sustained themselves on beef in summer, when there used to be massive food scarcity. They would eat even dead or diseased cattle.
In my own village, when I was a child, there were about 70 to 80 Dalit families. I remember they used to have full-stomach food in summer only when they were given cattle either sick or dead. They never received rice, millet or any regular food. This situation continues even now.
As for Muslims, meat has been a historical and religiously accepted food. Again, all Muslims were and are not as poverty-stricken as Dalits were. They have other food resources.
So Muslims and Christians are not the only consumers of beef in India, as is often made out?
Yes, and this can be seen even today. In the city of Hyderabad, during the month of Ramzan, Muslims eat haleem, whether of lamb or beef or chicken, only after they break their fast at sunset and after the evening prayers. But the other communities, including the Brahmin youths, start eating haleem at 4.30 pm. A major portion of beef-haleem in restaurants popular for this savoury dish is consumed by non-Muslims even before the iftaar time. In essence, beef is consumed in much higher quantities by non-Muslims than Muslims. The consumption of beef by Christians in India is very little.
Culturally, what is being attempted is to use the state – that too, a democratic state – to destroy their food culture, their protein availability and food choice. “Their” stands for Dalits, Muslims, Christians and all those whose food habit included beef or who want to eat it. Choice is very important in a modern democracy.
I respect those who don't want to eat beef or mutton. There are two communities who definitely don't eat meat – Brahmins, particularly South Indian Brahmins, and Banias. They have become vegetarians over a period of time. What do you think will happen if tomorrow a dictator thinks that even plants have life and concludes that killing plants is worse than slaughtering one animal? After all, to feed a family you need to kill several lady's fingers, several brinjals, several tomatoes. But if you kill a bull, an entire family can survive on it for a week.
What are the ideas driving this cultural imposition?
These ideas were generated from the later Shaivite tradition with Shankaracharya. This was in response to Buddhists being beef-eaters and practising certain food restraints. Buddhists were never vegetarians. The real vegetarians were the Jains. But to counter the so-called theory of violence of Buddhists, Shankaracharya started a vegetarian campaign among Brahmins and upper castes. It was this campaign of Shankaracharya that turned the Brahmins of South India, much before those of North India, into vegetarians.
But that was in the past. What is the idea driving this cultural imposition today?
Today, South Indian Brahmins, even those educated in modern institutions, remain culturally embedded in their families. Their mindset operates as negatively on food culture as it does on the practice of untouchability. Even the best of the educated Brahmins or Banias practise untouchability, so deeply ingrained is the idea in them. This idea constitutes the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] ideological agenda for establishing cultural hegemony. To achieve this goal, the RSS has, among other things, turned beef into a Muslim-Hindu issue.
So the ban on beef is a device to create a monolithic Hindu community?
Yes. You also have to ask the question: when did the idea of not eating beef and meat become strong? Gandhi was essentially a Jain; they campaigned for cow protection as well as vegetarianism. It was Gandhi's campaign that took vegetarianism to non-Brahmin social groups that were meat-arian. The only people who were not really influenced by Gandhi's cow protection campaign and vegetarianism were Muslims, Christians and Dalits. If the Dalits were not affected, it was because Ambedkar immediately started a counter-campaign.
Counter-campaign?
When Gandhi began to work around the concept of Harijan and mobilising people around it, they had put in some conditions. One, they shouldn't eat meat. Two, they should pray in praise of Ram. Ambedkar realised that what Gandhi was doing was literally converting the Dalits to Hinduism. Ambedkar, therefore, started a campaign arguing that the Gandhian campaign was not going to help the Dalits. Ambedkar said the Dalits had to be respected along with their cultural roots. They said, you can't ask them to give up their culture of food, their culture of leather technology.
Ambedkar went on to debate the food issues. They said, all right, Dalits should give up eating dead cattle, but they shouldn't give up beef. They said this because Buddhists have a culture of eating beef. For instance, Buddhism in China, Japan and Korea allows multicultural food. They eat pork, beef, and don't consider any food culture taboo. Ambedkar was trying to impart a multicultural dimension to food practices in India, as against Gandhian vegetarianism. Ambedkar wrote at length on the evolution of people's food culture.
Why did the RSS adopt cow protection as one of the principal items on its agenda?
The RSS's logic is that the cow has to be given protection because it gives Indians milk, the reason why it has been historically treated as a divine animal. My point is that India does not live on cow milk; India lives on buffalo milk. Now why doesn't the RSS ask for buffalo protection?
If you look at the law in Gujarat, it has extended the ban on cow slaughter to include the bull and the bullock as well, but it is silent on buffalo meat. During Modi's period, more and more buffaloes started getting killed even as more and more cows began getting reared around milk-production factories. They started exporting buffalo meat.
This is absolute racism. Seventy five percent of milk in India is buffaloed milk. Yet you kill the buffalo because it is a black animal. American racism once upon a time destroyed the buffalo population there. RSS racism will lead to the killing of buffaloes. You see, the buffalo has always been present in India. But the cow came to India with the Aryans. The RSS wants to protect the Aryan animal. This casteist and racist approach has been extended to food culture. This is dangerous.
Are you saying that in order to establish the cultural hegemony of upper castes, the RSS seeks to project the Muslims as the only consumers of beef?
The internal discourse of the RSS, as evident from its publications, states that. But empirically, they are wrong. They claim that the only consumers of beef in India are Muslims and, therefore, they should give up eating it. That the Muslims are cow-killers and we the Hindus should fight them. This argument worked very well with the upper-caste Hindus.
But what is dangerous is this idea that the RSS has taken to the OBCs, who are more and more rallying around it. The RSS's recruitment of OBCs has undeniably increased after the Babri Masjid demolition, and it is doing so by creating a theoretical framework. The RSS says that not eating beef is Hindu culture and, therefore, Indian culture. The obverse is that consuming beef is alien culture ‒ Muslim and Christian.
They are trying to argue two things theoretically, in a very funny way. One, they are saying that there was no culture of eating beef before the advent of Muslims. This is absolutely false. Of late, they have started saying that even untouchability was created by the Muslims. It is through this theoretical framework that they are trying to reach out to the Dalits and also convert them to Hinduism and vegetarianism.
They are extending the argument among the OBCs that eating meat is not Hindu culture. This is wrong. Meat has always been part of marriage feasts of OBCs and feasts hosted during death rituals. But the OBCs in south India are giving up these cultural practices. I challenge the RSS to prove which of the Hindu gods and which of the Hindu scriptures mandated that beef should not be eaten. Which Hindu god has said they won't accept beef or pork as a spiritual offering? They have the Vedas, the Upanishads, Bhgavad Gita, etc. The RSS has now synthesised a spiritual sanctity around the Bhagvad Gita. Let them show me one line that says that beef should not be eaten.
But what you have said is also proof that the RSS has been successful in popularising its ideas.
Earlier, the RSS used to propagate vegetarianism among Brahmin-Jain-Bania families. They then took this idea to the RSS shakhas. Now the VHP and the Bajrang Dal are spreading it. They say they are doing it as part of their attempt to popularise the non-violent theory. There couldn't be a bigger joke than that. If non-violence is your divine theory, why do you have idols and images representing violence in divine form? Was Ram non-violent? Was Krishna non-violent? Did they not kill enemies? How can they, therefore, argue that the killing of birds or bulls is violence?
Secondly, my most important issue is that if you ban killing of animals and leave them to die a natural death, would the agrarian economy survive? Who would rear the cattle then? Why do people rear chickens? Not to put in a museum, right? You breed, say, 100 chickens and you kill 10 of them at the end of the month. You rear them more and only to eat them at some point.
Why do people rear cattle in rural India? Because cows give birth to calves, and calves become bulls. Before the mechanisation of agriculture, bulls tilled the land and provided agrarian labour, so to speak. Tractors have now taken over the role of bullocks. It must be remembered that India doesn't depend on cow milk. The cattle have other economic benefits – manure is used for fertiliser and fuel, and once it dies or is killed, its skin is sent to the tannery and bones are used for making items such as combs.
But when the economic benefits of the cattle diminish, it is better to kill them for food, and sell its skins and bones. A dead cow isn't buried because its bones and skin can't be utilised then. So who is going to bear the expenses of an ageing or sick cow? The RSS is destroying the Indian agrarian economy. In the future the agrarian economy will not have the cow and the bull – and the benefits arising from them will be denied to villagers. Instead, you will have a few gaushalas, built and looked after by the RSS, the VHP and the Brahmins.
Will the cattle slaughter go underground?
Illicit consumption will take place, particularly among Dalits and tribals, because they don't live in the vicinity of law-enforcing agencies. But the consumption of beef by Muslims will be curtailed. This is because the Muslim community is urbanised and is not as widely dispersed as other social groups. Apart from a reduction in consumption, the ban in the city of Mumbai will adversely affect traders who became rich because of beef, bone and leather exports.
What do you think about the quantum of punishment – a person violating the ban can get five years of imprisonment in Maharashtra and 10 years in Haryana?
The problem is that the central government can't make a law because agriculture is a state subject. It says it will make a model law and circulate it among the states. This is a very dangerous development as it tacitly encourages states to ban cow slaughter.
As for the quantum of punishment, I think cattle seem to enjoy greater privileges than some sections of society. There should have been protests – Muslims and Christians should have come out on the streets. For one reason or another, Muslims are scared. Mayawati and other Dalit leaders should join hands with Muslims and Christians to oppose this dangerous move of the state to determine people's food habits and challenge their cultural roots and their right to choose.

The epic courtroom battle between the WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning and the US government over their alleged pre-trial punishment has drawn to a close, with the soldier's lawyer accusing the military of treating them like a zoo animal and the prosecution countering that in its view they were entitled to have just seven days removed from any eventual sentence.
The two-week hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, lasted far longer than intended and turned into a dramatic spectacle in which Manning effectively turned their court-martial on its head and put the US military on trial. In their closing argument, the soldier's main civilian lawyer, David Coombs, said that the most amazing element of their nine-month solitary confinement under suicide-prevention restrictions at the marine brig in Quantico, Virginia, was that their spirit had remained unbroken.
"Being watched or viewed almost as a zoo animal for that period of time has to weigh on somebody's psyche," Coombs told the court.
Over 10 days of intense legal proceedings, lasting for up to eight hours every day, a clear picture emerged within the courtroom of how Manning, 24, had been trapped in a Kafkaesque paradox. Whatever they did – or didn't do – was taken by their military captors as proof of their suicidal tendencies.
The court heard from psychiatrists who had reported virtually every week that Manning was in good mental health and no risk to himself. Yet every week they were overruled by military officers at the brig.
Manning was made to strip naked at night and to stand to attention in the nude in front of their military superiors at morning call. For weeks they were held in their 8x6 ft cell for 23 hours and 40 minutes every day.
In their summing up, Coombs suggested that the military had been more concerned to protect itself from media criticism than it was about following its own guidelines and treating Manning properly. "They were more concerned with how it would look if something happened to Pfc Manning than they were about whether Pfc Manning was actually at risk. Their approach was: 'Let's not have anything happen on our watch. Let's not let anything happen that's going to make us look bad.'"
Coombs added that correct military procedures had suffered a "complete breakdown … All logic by anyone who could affect change for Pfc Manning was checked at the door."
Manning has been charged with "aiding the enemy" – in effect al-Qaida – by passing hundreds of thousands of confidential US documents to the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. They have effectively admitted passing government information to the site but has not accepted that by doing so they acted as a traitor.
In its closing argument, the US government made some concession to the defence claim that they were subjected to overly rigorous suicide-prevention controls. It conceded that the inmate should have been taken off suicide watch – the most stringent regime possible – more swiftly, in line with the advice from brig psychiatrists.
But the prosecutors only accepted that Manning had been subjected to seven days of unwarranted suicide watch, and called the judge to award a 1:1 reduction in the soldier's eventual sentence. That would mean that Manning would be entitled to just seven days of credit in recognition of what they went through in Quantico, a reduction that would come off a maximum possible sentence of life in custody with no chance of parole.
The offer outraged Manning supporters. Nathan Fuller of the Bradley Manning support network, tweeted: "So the U.S. government argues that Bradley Manning should be sentenced to the rest of their life in prison...minus seven days."
Manning supporters were also outraged by a comment made in closing argument by Major Ashden Fein, the chief government prosecutor. "When brig officials saw someone who was not like others, they tried to figure it out to the best of their abilities on a daily basis."
In earlier testimony the court, the judge has heard that at the time they transferred government information to WikiLeaks Manning was struggling with deep emotional conflicts including their desire to have gender re-alignment.
The burden of proof lies with the US government to show that the maximum security status and suicide-prevention measures it imposed throughout the nine months in Quantico were justified. The unprecedented length of time Manning spent in solitary confinement supposedly because they were a risk to themselves prompted the UN rapporteur on torture to denounce it as a form of torture.
The judge presiding over Manning's court-martial, Colonel Denise Lind, now has a mountain of transcripts and admitted evidence to wade through before they can issue their ruling on the defence motion. The earliest they are likely to do so would be in the next pre-trial hearing scheduled for 8 January.
KXAN Staff - AUSTIN (KXAN) -- An Austin woman who has a history of driving under the influence will spend 18 years in prison for a 2014 crash that killed two people.
On Tuesday, Melissa Marshall, 43, pled guilty to two counts of intoxication manslaughter in the deaths of Lynne M. Clopton, 46, and James Clopton. 49.

On Feb. 4, 2014, police say Marshall was driving their Ford Escape northbound on the service road of Research Boulevard when they collided with a Honda Civic traveling east along Balcones Woods Drive. Lynne, the passenger in the Civic, died at the scene. James died a short time later at the hospital.
At the time of the crash, Marshall told police they had consumed three 8-ounce glasses of Chardonnay the night before the crash, and was concerned the alcohol was still in their system, according to an arrest affidavit. The officer said they observed a strong odor of alcohol on Marshall's breath and said their eyes were glassy and bloodshot, and their speech was slurred.
Marshall's official sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2017.
Marshall had previously been convicted on two DUI counts, in San Fernando, California, in 2006, and in Las Vegas in 2010.

PHILADELPHIA – Only hours after pulling off a significant – and drama-filled – victory in New York, Democratic front-runner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to the host city of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, where they hope to return in only a few months to claim the party's blessing as its general election nominee.
Clinton began their tour of Philadelphia Wednesday with a low-profile but highly emotional exchange with former Attorney General Eric Holder and members of the Mothers of the Movement group – women who lost children and loved ones to gun violence or after altercations with police officers.
The women, whose ranks in the past have included the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, rallied around Clinton in New York, South Carolina and Ohio, among other states. On Wednesday, a group of them told their stories at a small baptist church in Philadelphia.
"It's a club that no one wants to be a part of. We don't want any more members. No one else is allowed," says Nicole Paultre Bell, whose fiance, Sean Bell, was killed in 2006 on the morning of their wedding after an encounter with a group of plainclothes New York Police Department officers. "We decided to support Hillary because they supported us. Before we knew what our next steps were going to be, we had a phone call, from Sen. Clinton at the time, expressing their concern for what we had just gone through."
Bell and several other women recounted being contacted by Clinton staffers and eventually meeting with them – a meeting they say helped unify them. Though some had joined them on the campaign trail prior to Wednesday's event, they unanimously endorsed them as the right person to move into the White House next year.
Clinton, in turn, took the opportunity Wednesday to discuss procedural reform for police officers and to denounce what they say are inappropriately lax firearm regulations.
"This weekend in Philadelphia, you had 12 shootings. You had four people murdered, including a 4-year-old girl. You had a police officer shot. That was just one weekend in one American city," Clinton said. "The federal government has a role to play, but we also have to change laws and approaches in the states and cities as well. We need to develop a national consensus."
The church was an interesting choice for Clinton's first public foray into Pennsylvania following Tuesday night's victory in New York. Walking to St. Paul's Baptist Church at the intersection of 10th and Wallace streets, a handful of abandoned and dilapidated storefronts speckle the area. Tall metal gates, bent with age, line the sidewalks. Towering over the neighborhood is a factory now orange with rust and tattooed with graffiti.
The event itself was held in a modestly sized room striped with folding metal chairs, which were filled by Clinton supporters, gun control and police reform advocates and scores of reporters and photographers. At the far end of the room, what appeared to be a partially shattered stained glass window was boarded up. Ceiling fans whirred overhead – some broken or with burned-out lightbulbs, and one that swung about and clanged like church bells.
The neighborhood, the window and the venue seemed to symbolize the Mothers of the Movement group, whose own lives were broken and eroded by the loss of a child.
Clinton has long supported the Mothers of the Movement group, and they have campaigned with them in several other states. Considering Pennsylvania holds the sixth-largest number of prisoners in state or federal correctional facilities in the entire country, according to the Justice Department , it's unsurprising they took the opportunity to focus on police reform and speak with some mothers who lost children during altercations with police officers.
There was also an element of damage control at play, considering former President Bill Clinton's heated exchange with Black Lives Matter protesters at a Philadelphia campaign event on behalf of their wife earlier this month, over the former president's 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which, among other things, introduced harsher penalties for nonviolent drug-related crimes.
"We obviously have to do a whole lot more to avoid what they call the school-[to]-prison pipeline," Clinton said Wednesday. "We also have to look at the sentencing structures and the mandatory minimums and the whole set of issues that have been raised that we have to address."
Though the act wasn't ever explicitly referenced at Wednesday's event, it seemed that Clinton's supporters who joined them on stage were willing to look past their prior support , as first lady for the laws that they believe have helped America's prison populations boom.
"Anytime you have to go back to 1994 to find something bad on a person, they must be a bad sister, OK?" says Geneva Reed-Beal, whose daugher, Sandra Bland, was found hanged in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas. They noted that Clinton's interest in their cause sealed the deal for them
"When you're openly grieving and the secretary of state steps to you, you'd better endorse her," they said. "Because she's already endorsed you."
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION VP for the Digital Agenda has called the US Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) "bad legislation".
In a message on Twitter Neelie Kroes said that they were glad to see opposition against SOPA growing.
"Glad tide is turning on #SOPA: don't need bad legislation when it should be safeguarding benefits of open net", they tweeted. "Speeding is illegal too: but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway #SOPA".
Kroes' comments come at the end of a very big week for the SOPA legislation in the US, one in which internet industry and public opposition mounted to the point that it could not be ignored.
Hours before calling SOPA "bad legislation" they hinted at their position, saying, "there is no #EU version of #SOPA. Internet reg must be effective, proportionate, preserve benefits of open net."
In November last year Kroes said that copyright laws were too strict and had moved away from the artists that they were supposed to support.
"We need to go back to basics and put the artist at the centre, not only of copyright law, but of our whole policy on culture and growth. In times of change, we need creativity, out-of-the-box thinking: creative art to overcome this difficult period and creative business models to monetise the art," they said.
"The life of an artist is tough: the crisis has made it tougher. Let's get back to basics, and deliver a system of recognition and reward that puts artists and creators at its heart." µ
One imam down, another apparent hatemonger – this one a rapper – to go.
B'nai Brith CEO Michael Mostyn said Monday it was “good” to see the Hate Crimes Unit of the Montreal police finally charge Sheikh Muhammad Musa Al Nasr with the wilful promotion of hatred following their sermon of more than six months ago.
Al Nasr, while a guest of Montreal's Dar-Al-Arqam mosque last Dec. 23, delivered a sermon in which they contend that Jews are “the most evil of humankind” and quoted from a religious text (associated with the Qur'an) that at the end of time…the stone and tree will say: “Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me – come and kill him!”
Mostyn said their understanding is that Al Nasr is back in Jordan but they're “still awaiting an apology” from the mosque in question – especially since their hateful sermon is still posted on their website.
Efforts to reach the mosque were unsuccessful Monday.
Mostyn said the Montreal police is now also investigating a rapper by the name of Jonathan Azaziah, aka “Madd Cold,” who calls themselves the “Iraqi destroyer of Jewish lies” even though they were born in the United States and spends much of their time in Montreal.
The B'nai Brith reports that the goal of Azaziah's music is to “liberate the current discourse in Western circles that centres around appeasing Zionist Jews, who constitute the greatest threat to the survival of human beings on Earth.”
Much of Azaziah's music and even their social media content was no longer online Monday – following complaints to all of their music distributors by B'nai Brith.
However this YouTube interview was still available:
Mostyn said it is “very heartening” to find out that the content had been removed as it is simply “inciting hate.”
It's been a busy week for Jewish advocacy groups fighting hate speech and anti-Semitism in Canada.
There was the Ontario Grade 6 textbook published by Nelson Canada–Canada and the Global Community – which claimed children are being used as soldiers in “armed conflict” in 20 countries, including Israel.
Later in the week – following tremendous pressure from Jewish politicians and advocacy groups – the Canadian government and the LCBO announced its intention to reverse its ban on two Israeli wines produced in the West Bank.
In a style very much reminiscent of the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement (a pro-Palestinian movement that calls for boycotts of Israeli products and pressures celebrities not to perform in Israel), the Canadian Food and Inspection Agency issued a July 6 directive that wines imported from the Shiloh and Psagot wineries are labelled wrong as they are not a “product of Israel.”
According to that CFIA directive, the wine products have been made from grapes that are “grown, fermented, processed, blended and finished” in the West Bank “occupied territory.”
The LCBO notified its vendors of the edict in a July 12 letter.
The uproar was swift and intense and late Thursday afternoon, the CFIA backtracked, indicating in a statement that they had not considered the fact that two wines adhered to the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement.
No apologies have so far been given either by the CFIA or the LCBO.

Trump's recent decision to add troops in Afghanistan has nothing to do with combating terrorism (or mining mineral resources, or confusing militants as to when the U.S. military might finally leave), no matter what the endless stream of pundits and think-pieces have argued since it was announced. After 16 years of occupation the Taliban control 48 of nearly 400 administrative units, the Islamic State has established a foothold, the United States supplies almost the entirety of the military and civilian budget, the Afghan military is incapable of functioning without U.S. support, opium production has increased so that Afghanistan supplies 77% of the world's heroin, and by the end of the next fiscal year the total cost of the 16-year Afghan war alone will be $1 trillion. Afghanistan and Pakistan have engaged in their worst border clashes in years as militants shift back and forth between both countries at will. Chinese troops operate openly in the country and conduct joint security exercises with Afghan forces. Russia is now debating a military intervention, ostensibly to counter the growing Taliban threat.
Trump, like Obama, had promised on the campaign trail to end the war. The war itself is deeply unpopular, and their stance on ending the war (like Obama's before it) may have helped secure their victory in crucial states with high casualty rates. Now less than a year into their term Trump has decided to increase troop levels by 3,900, which their generals had requested earlier this summer. Since it is unlikely to help their dismal popularity ratings, what rationale would they have to do so? The usual suspects – combating terrorism and stabilizing the Afghan state – collapse quickly with even cursory investigation. After 16 years the Afghan government is little more than a puppet state, and after spending nearly a trillion dollars the United States clearly has no desire to build an economy and social programs that would modernize the country and loosen the reactionary social relations that give the Taliban and IS strength. The plan itself is one simply recycled from the early Obama era when Joe Biden was its pitchman.
No doubt this is, in good part, due to the inertia of the American empire. Representatives of the military-industrial complex have done very well selling the War on Terror; the ruling class – or the Power Elite if you prefer – seem to have a consensus that the war must continue not only to aid their own pockets and to give the military a place to test its new toys, but also because the empire should not voluntarily leave a place once it has been conquered. While it is true that Trump has staffed their administration at higher levels with generals, the national-security state's apparatus seems to be able to control policy much like previous regimes. It is merely more visible because Trump's unpredictable nature has caused the apparatus to show its face more often than it likes, and the generals have been more willing to accept roles with overt policy-making implications that in previous eras would have been done behind closed doors.
The real reason is that Afghanistan is a forward operating base for the U.S. military in Asia in its attempts to counter China's inevitable rise, whatever the official justifications for maintaining troops there are. China's $900 billion Belt and Road Initiative aims to lay the trans-continental infrastructure to allow its transition from great power to world-hegemon. Its projected land routes go north around Afghanistan and south through Pakistan. Given that the United States recently began a “Pivot to Asia” strategy aimed at building an economic and military partnership with Asian states to balance China, and that the economic side of that – the Transpacific Partnership – was temporarily defeated, there has been an increased emphasis on its military part by the national security state.
In addition, India, alarmed at China's rise and open provocation on its eastern flank, has already signed an historic agreement to allow U.S. warships and aircraft to use Indian bases for “refueling, repair, and other logistical purposes.” The United States conducted joint naval war games with India and Japan this summer. It is clear that the United States is turning towards India at the same time as Pakistan moves closer to China's sphere of influence. China has signaled its displeasure at these containment efforts, even as it expands its military footprint into the South China Sea and Africa. Given that Afghanistan borders the northern and southern route of China's New Silk Road, and India has openly aligned itself with the United States, what is the likelihood of American troops leaving Afghanistan?
Because of this, it is more likely we will see an open-ended presence of the U.S. military in Afghanistan than troops leaving for good at any point in the short or medium-term. Indeed, there is no domestic political group that will force the war to end. The anti-war Left in the United States is virtually non-existent outside of a small fraction of consistently anti-imperialist groups. Bush and Obama's presidencies proved the bulk of protesters over the last decade to be anti-Republican Wars, but quite happy to ignore the imperial actions of a Democrat. The litmus test for any leftist movement going forward has to be its stance on foreign policy and consistent, unwavering anti-imperialism. Until then the rationale for keeping troops in Afghanistan is just too great for the American empire as it looks to balance the rise of China and to shore up alliances with regional powers like India. America's longest war will get that much longer, and unfortunately there's not much yet we are likely to do about it.
Russia is to deploy two new divisions in the west and one in the south to counterbalance NATO's increased military presence near Russian borders, Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu announced.
“The Defense Ministry is taking a number of measures to respond to the NATO military buildup at the Russian border,” Shoigu said on Wednesday. “Before the year's end two new divisions will be formed in the Western Military District and one in the Southern Military District.”

Earlier there were reports in the Russian media that three new divisions with 10,000 troops each may be deployed in Rostov-on-Don, the Smolensk Region and the Voronezh Region.
NATO has been sending additional forces to Poland, the Baltic States and elsewhere near Russian borders since 2014. It claimed that the deployments were necessary to build confidence of Eastern European members in the face of "Russian aggression."

The perceived aggression was exemplified by the example of Crimea, which seceded from Ukraine after a coup in Kiev. The former Ukrainian region voted in a referendum to join Russia, which was described as an illegal annexation through military force by the new government in Kiev and its foreign allies.

Moscow rejected the reasoning and said that the alliance was using the political crisis in Ukraine to justify its existence by playing the old Russia scaremongering card.
During a top-level meeting at the ministry, Shoigu also said that Russia has rapped-up military training and production of advanced military hardware in response to the NATO threat.

Guy Pohto, 59, of Cook was charged Friday with reckless manslaughter, a felony, and hunting in a careless manner, a misdemeanor, in connection with the death of Justin Burns of Palisade, Colo., according to the Daily Sentinel in Grand Junction, Colo.
The Mesa County Sheriff's Office reported that the teen was bow hunting with their father when they were shot. Pohto also was a licensed hunter, the Denver Post reported.
"According to Colorado Parks and Wildlife, it is currently archery and muzzleloader season for various big game, and bear rifle season in many areas across the state," the sheriff's office reported the day after the shooting.
The criminal complaint alleges that Pohto fired a shot that struck the boy in the chest, according to the Daily Sentinel. The Mesa County Coroner's Office ruled the death a homicide.
Pohto is scheduled to appear in Mesa County District Court on Oct. 22. The Daily Sentinel reported that they could not be reached for comment Friday, and their attorney declined comment.

Last Friday, the people who are making No Man's Sky told me they'd been late to a meeting with Steven Spielberg. The legendary director waited, though, because he—like millions of other people across the world—was fiending to play No Man's Sky. No pressure, right?
The reason Hello Games' away team was late showing their space exploration title to ET's daddy? The blame lies squarely on Elon Musk. Yes, the billionaire who's putting electric cars on the road and rocketships in space just had to see the game, too. Me? I was choking on Los Angeles smog as I waited for studio co-founder Sean Murray to wrap up the demo meetings scheduled to happen before mine. Hello Games wasn't stationed at the Los Angeles Convention Center during E3, choosing instead to rent out a penthouse apartment close-by. You could see the convention center from their perch but it seemed, appropriately, a world away.
The quiet in the near-empty apartment suited No Man's Sky well. For all the 18-quintillion-planets hype surrounding the game, the procedurally generated first-person adventure feels, at core, like a quieter experience than many other games. I played about fifteen minutes of No Man's Sky last week, warping from one solar system to another, discovering new lifeforms, mining resources and getting embroiled in a skirmish between pirates and freighters outside a massive space station. Here's a bit of what I learned, some from Murray and some from first-hand experience:
Advertisement
You can only have one ship and one weapon. Each one will support modifications to make them uniquely functional, with various ships offering a different number of inventory slots. So, players won't be amassing a fleet of vessels in this game. Upgrading handheld weapons will help with mining, too.
Harvesting resources will be a big part of the game's economy. The millions of planets in No Man's Sky will be home to unique natural resources and elements, which sit on a made-up periodic table. You'll be able to scan for them and then blast outcroppings or underground deposits to claim the shiny minerals. You'll be able to sell these resources in their raw form or combine them into bespoke alloys that might be even more valuable. They'll also be used for crafting upgrades.

A vanilla spacesuit isn't going to cut it. The default protective garb players start the game off with won't be all-purpose. You'll need to buy and upgrade survival gear for toxic, radioactive and frozen planets.
There won't really be a traditional story. Instead, Murray told me, there's a layer of lore undergirding the exploration. For example, the Sentinels patrolling the planets you visit were made by an ancient race and seeded throughout the galaxy to preserve the delicate balance of planetary ecosystems. But the Sentinels are a bit out of control, Murray teased, hinting at a thread of lore that may be lying in wait for players to discover.

If players destroy too much of a planet's geography or wildlife, the Sentinels will hunt you down and try to make you pay. Similarly, attacking trade ships as they try to dock into space stations can draw out fleets of enforcer vessels ready to blow you to bits.

The time I spent playing and watching No Man's Sky left me feeling like the PS4/PC title will be more meditative than anything else. Yes, there were explosions and dogfights and giant robots bearing down on me during that session. But, as my ship skimmed over the red oceans of one planet and I walked through the mushroom grass and watched overgrown rabbit creatures skip past, I started to think of No Man's Sky as a giant book that will live inside my PS4. If all goes well, I'll be able to play through a chapter or two every night, come away with a weird thing to show for my travels, and compare notes with fellow adventurers. That's all I want right now.

London gets too much credit. Whenever right-wing Israel advocates complain about hotbeds of Palestinian solidarity politics, they look no further. Perhaps It's because the British capital is guilty as charged. Or maybe it's due to a fear of finding out how widespread support for the Palestinian cause actually is, throughout western Europe.
Italy is a great example. Visit any of the major cities in the north, and you'll see a surprising amount of solidarity flyers and graffiti posted by local activists. Genoa, Milan, Turin, even Venice, all boast their fare share of anti-occupation messaging. With good reason. For decades, support for the Palestinians has been commonplace on the Italian left.
The flyer below, was photographed in Genoa. Advertising an event commemorating the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre, it's as good example of the kinds of solidarity literature one will encounter in Italy. As per the lead photo (shot next to the flyer,) sympathy for the Palestinians does not occur in a vacuum. It's part of a broader set of political concerns shared by local progressives.

On 15th and 16th of September, 1982 the Israeli army slaughtered thousands of Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Chatila [refugee camps] in Lebanon. Palestinians are a people without a State, oppressed by Israel and by world imperialist powers. Also this year, we want to remember the massacre of Palestinian people. We'll do it by analyzing the situation of the Middle East regionally, [as it has been] upset by rebellions, counter-revolutions, [and] wars. From Tunisia to Egypt, from Libya to Syria, the wind of rebellion must deal with the ambitions of imperialism, which, after the Libyan war, in Syria, is ready to provoke a conflict that may spread. Does the crisis of capitalism lead to imperialist war? What role can the anti-war movement, revolutionists, and communists play?

Toronto FC have fired coach Paul Mariner and will unveil their replacement Ryan Nelsen at a news conference Tuesday.
The move comes a month after Kevin Payne was hired as TFC's new president and GM.
Mariner was named coach of the Reds in June when the team started off 1-9-0 under Aron Winter.
Mariner had solid initial success before a spate of injuries to key players and a string of late-game collapses led to a club-record 14-game winless streak to end 2012.
The team has never made the playoffs and finished a franchise-worst 5-21-8 record last season.
Nelsen, 35, plays for Queens Park Rangers in the English Premier League and had been linked with a coaching role at former club DC United in the United States.
Nelsen used to play for Payne at D.C. United.
“He is a massive part of your team (but) they want to be a manager and it is a chance for them to manage a club,” QPR manager Harry Redknapp told reporters this week.
“He has been fantastic. I took them to Tottenham last year from Blackburn. He's one of the best pros I've ever met in my life, a fantastic player, a great trainer, a leader,” they said.

Mexicans want European customers for their cheese and orange juice. Europe's manufacturers hope to sell toothbrushes and marble to Mexico's growing middle class. And if Mexican revelers need some fizz to ring in the New Year, France wants it to be French champagne.
So much for NAFTA.
With President Trump threatening to tear up North America's 23-year-old free-trade agreement, Mexican officials are in Brussels this week trying to upgrade a deal with Europe to soften the hit.
Mexico is not the only U.S. ally forced to look for new friends. Since Washington shrugged off its role as globalization's biggest cheerleader, Japan has worked out an agreement with the European Union that is awaiting a final green light.
[Japan and Europe counter Trump with colossal trade deal]
And after U.S. trade officials criticized the World Trade Organization at a ministers' meeting in Buenos Aires last week, other nations seem to be doubling down on a defiant response: The globalized model the Americans once championed will survive without them.
"We hope that over the next few days that we will be able to have a positive outcome on Mexico," said the top E.U. agriculture official, Phil Hogan, who is to meet with Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal on Wednesday.
Apart from the European Union, Mexico is bargaining with Argentina, Brazil and Asia. Meanwhile, Europe is flirting with Latin America, Australia and New Zealand. The efforts were turbocharged by Trump's free-trade skepticism after they abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pan-Asian deal that was a pet project of the Obama administration and included the E.U., Japan and Mexico.
[Trump suggests ignoring World Trade Organization in major policy shift]
Officials involved in the negotiations say they have been happy to try to salvage the rubble from Trump's torpedo.
"The E.U. is left as practically the only big player in the global arena without the U.S., so it's a necessity to conclude agreements," said Alessia Mosca, the E.U. lawmaker overseeing the Mexico deal for the European Parliament. "For this reason there has been a speedup to the talks."
Mexico and the European Union already have a free-trade agreement that went into effect in 2000, but that was at the start of the Internet era, and officials say it is out of date. The new talks seek to expand and modernize the agreement, adding previously excluded items such as grains, meat and dairy.
Mexico's quest for new trading partners represents an insurance policy against economic harm if the Trump administration decides to end NAFTA, because about 80 percent of Mexican exports go north to the United States. And if new tariffs suddenly boosted the cost of imported corn and car parts, Mexico could turn to South America or Europe.
[No NAFTA? No problem, says one Mexican city]
"The strategy is to have alternative suppliers if the U.S. leaves NAFTA, which is not what we want or hope," said Luis de la Calle, an economist and one of the original NAFTA negotiators.
De la Calle said Mexico hopes to sell juice, fruit and vegetables to Europe.
"Mexico has already made the decision to independently diversify trade," they said. "There is an appetite for trade agreements, and Mexico is taking advantage of that appetite."
For now, the talks are hung up on a few issues, including European insistence about labeling rules for foods such as Parmesan cheese. But officials on both sides say they want to reach a bargain, in part to send a message to Trump.
Still, some analysts caution that there is a limit to trade deals, noting also that the United States is hardly alone in its growing wariness of globalization. Nor did the new skepticism originate with Trump — even their Democratic presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, dropped their support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership during the 2016 campaign.
"We have for the past 10 years been in this strange and difficult situation for many countries that for 50 years broadly followed the leadership of America in global trade policy," said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank.
"Now America isn't there," they said. "And many countries, including those in the E.U., have difficulties to figure out what to do now."

EDMONTON - Marina Banister knows it's not easy to be a vegan around here.
“Meat is part of the culture of Alberta,” says the University of Alberta political science student. “I personally come from a very meat-and-potatoes, very Albertan family.”
Still, Banister, who chairs the sustainability committee of the Edmonton Youth Council, believes passionately that reducing meat consumption is critical to food sustainability. That's why the youth advisers brought the issue this week to city council and recommended Edmonton's municipal politicians be served only vegan or vegetarian snack platters during long meetings.
A decade ago, a little story like this wouldn't have rated much attention.
But this is the age of social media and the online mob. When they challenged Alberta's sacred cows, the 16 members of the youth council, who range in age from 13 to 23, found themselves in the centre of a national social media storm.
On Twitter and on media comment boards, they were derided by people across the country as “lefty loser busybodies” and “self-loathing liberal white guilt-suffering crybabies”, as “trumped-up little squirts” and “vegi-nazis.”
One particularly charming tweeter called for the murder of any councillor who voted in favour of vegan snack trays.
As a committed carnivore myself, I think it's an inappropriate micro-managing of personal choice to compel city councillors to adopt vegan-only catering. It's a political gesture which would ultimately mean little to our environment. Council has better ways to spend its energy. But one can make such arguments, without descending to vicious personal attacks on idealistic people.
Given the amount of time Canadian adults spend obsessing about teen cyberbullying, it was disturbing to watch the spectacle of adults taking to the Internet to gang up, dog-pile style, on well-meaning youth volunteers.
It was Banister, a striking brunette, who became the focus the most disturbing adult rage, which expressed itself in darkly sexist terms.
“It's hard to believe the babe in the photo developed to what they are on only vegetables!!” said one National Post commenter.
‘“The babe in the photo” weighs maybe seven stone soaking wet and probably can't stand up in a stiff wind,” replied another.
“She looks great until you get their clothes off and they proceed to just lay there exhausted from all that walking and not eating real food,” came the next comment.
It was as if Banister personally embodied, in microcosm, all the things online trolls love most to hate. It all devolved into a post-modern witch hunt, a shocking display of social media's power at its ugliest.
“I am 20 years old and this is my first entry into the public arena,” says Banister, ruefully reflecting on their week. “When I saw someone post, ‘Well, it's a good thing she's pretty, because they aren't very smart,' I felt bad. But after a while, I started to find the comments sort of amusing. I didn't let them faze me.”
Other commenters, they said, attacked them for wearing makeup, suggesting they couldn't be a serious environmentalist or real feminist if they used nail polish.
“I think seeing a young female associated with the vegan moment just changed the tone of the debate a bit,” they said. “I think if people had seen a picture of a male, if my name were Mark, not Marina, the conversation would have been different. I pride myself on being a very rational person. I'm a researcher. And anyone obsessed with my appearance or my age probably doesn't have a lot of rational arguments to make.”
LONDON (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake struck northeast Iran on Wednesday near the holy city of Mashhad, leaving at least one person dead and several injured.
The quake, of magnitude 6.1 according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), occurred 76 km (47 miles) east-southeast of the city and at a depth of 33 km.
The governor of the province said on the state television that the quake happened at 10:39 a.m. local time (0609 GMT) and had shaken a vast area.
State news agency IRNA quoted emergency services spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi as saying there were fears that casualties in villages and small towns could be high. Red Crescent teams and emergency services had been deployed to the area, they said.
A Red Crescent official was quoted by state media as saying one person had died in a village near the city of Fariman and at that least four were injured.
Pictures posted on social media showed deep cracks in streets and buildings and Tasnim news agency reported that phone lines in some of the affected area were disrupted.
Local people said in media reports and on Twitter they had felt more than a dozen aftershocks, with some afraid to go back to their homes.
Looks like we aren't the only ones who enjoy riding inappropriate bikes in the desert. For the past six years, the guys at Fuel Bespoke in Barcelona have been holding Scram Africa; a ride, over 2000km, that tests the skills of riders through the south of Morocco on roads, trails and dunes. A trip specifically for nostalgic riders inspired by the original 70's scramblers – sorry, you'll have to leave that KTM at home.
This project started when the guys at Fuel were approached by their good friend Marco who had joined them on many Scram Africa rides in the past, but wanted something new for the latest adventure.
“The idea was basically to make an interesting bike with a low budget” says Karles from Fuel. “Improving the aesthetics and, at the same time, improving other aspects of the bike for off road riding.” They decided to base the build on the trusty 2016 Yamaha SR400. The SR400 is no newcomer to custom builds, but the usual suspects are café racers or street trackers often spotted in urban environments. Not usually built for a desert ride like this, across some very challenging terrain.
In order for it to be Scram Africa race ready, it needed quite a few modifications. The first thing Fuel needed to sort out was the handling. The bike needed to carry Marco forays over some rough and rugged desert tracks for 10 days, so the rear shocks were swapped out for those by YSS. Plus, the spring forks were changed for more progressive ones – these mods greatly improved the handling of the bike straight away.
Then they worked on the looks and the riding position of the bike. Some obvious changes, like new off-road footpegs and a more tracker style handlebar were added, giving it a more upright and comfortable riding position than the original. The exhaust manifold was also modified in order to allow the silencer to get a better angle than the stock one.
The rear of the bike is where it gets interesting. The guys at Fuel added a bit of Spanish influence to this Japanese classic by adding a modified fibreglass seat cowl from a vintage Ossa Stiletto. “The Ossa Stiletto was also known as the ‘Moto-Cross' or ‘Scrambler‘ and was introduced to the English market as ‘Avenger',” says Karles. “That seat cowl plus a single scrambler style seat gives a new line and a totally different image to the original model.”
To finish the bike off, Marco really wanted the colour of the bike to be “joyful & fun” – which also reflected the spirit of the Scram Africa event. So what may have seemed like an inappropriate bike to take on the Moroccan desert turned out to be the most fun and reliable bike to finish this gruelling ride – is there anything the SR can't do? I don't think so.

Police say 3 men set Savan Rathod on fire because they suspected that they had stolen car batteries.
The father of a 17-year-old boy who died in a Pune hospital last week after being set on fire, has alleged that their son was murdered by three men because they were Hindu."When my son was admitted to hospital, they told me that they were set on fire by three suspects after they came to know that they were Hindu," Savan Rathod's father Dharma has alleged. A video made public purportedly confirms that the dying boy told this to their father and others in hospital.Savan Rathod, who worked as a rag-picker, was brought to Pune's government-run Sassoon Hospital with severe burn injuries on January 13. They died on January 15.The police have arrested three men - Ibrahim Shaikh, Juber Tamboli and Imran Tamboli - who they said had poured petrol on Savan and set them on fire because they suspected that they had stolen car batteries. Police officer Tushar Doshi said the police had found no communal angle to the murder so far.But right-wing activists in the city have accused the Pune police of shabby investigation. "We had given a video clip to the cops in which the deceased was seen telling that they were set on fire by three suspects, after they came to know that they were Hindu," said Ramesh Rathod, who heads an organisation called Banjara Kranti Dal.In the video, Savan says, "Three boys came and asked me what I was doing and what was my name. I told them it's Savan Rathod. They asked me if I was a Hindu. I said yes. Then they emptied a can on me and set me on fire."Asked again if they were set ablaze because they were a Hindu, Savan re-confirms it."It is as good as the dying declaration and the police should investigate the communal angle. They failed to take their dying statement when they were being treated at the state-run Sassoon Hospital," Mr Rathod said.Activists have demanded an investigation by Maharashtra's anti-terror squad. Milind Ekbote of the "Samast Hindu Aghadi," alleged that the cruelty with which the young boy was attacked points to "the modus operandi of the ISIS." They announced a protest at the Police Commissioner's office on January 27.
Mufin, the latest music-recommendation engine, is going to tell you what to listen to, and it doesn't care what you think.
Computers have been telling us what to listen to for years – at least since Amazon first told us that if we like X, we might like Y. But humans always have a hand in those recommendations: Pandora hires music experts, while Apple's Genius and CBS's Last.fm use collaborative filtering that notices when songs, artists or albums appear in the same collections.
On the other hand Mufin – the core of which was developed by a team run by "father of the MP3" Karlheinz Brandenburg (pictured) – ignores artist, album, genre and the other music people have in their collections and recommend songs based solely on raw computational analysis. The site recently launched as a private beta with nearly four million tracks. The results are intriguing – but not always what you might expect due to the rational nature of these algorithms, which dispenses with all notions of style or trendiness.
"There are tons of music sites out there, but as far as I know, we're the only one that depends on a fully automatic recommendation engine," said Petar Djekic, Mufin's head of marketing. Mufin's audio analysis engine finds music's sonic siblings based on 40 attributes per song including percussion, style, speech,
sound density, vocals, tempo, sound color, instruments, volume,
dynamics and loudness. Other attributes are at play here too, but Djekicsays they cannot be expressed as mathematical manifestations of musical concepts because they consist of statistical elements gleaned from humans' reactions to certain music.
"We first create a tag set where, first of all, people manually tagthe music," said Djekic. "We have this set of music files thathave been manually tagged, and then we see how our algorithm tags themusic so we can improve." Once these rules have been set into the algorithms, there's no human intervention in Mufin's music analysis as it encounters new music.
The core technology behind this automated music parsing is AudioID, developed Brandenburg, whose PhD and undergraduate thesesformed the basis of MP3 and other forms of audio compression.
Their team of audio analysts within Germany's massive FraunhoferGesellschaft organization won a company award for AudioID in 2002. Two years later, because it lacked the ability or inclination to exploit the technology, Fraunhofer spun the unit off as a commercial division called m2any that was purchasedby Magix in 2007.
Since then, AudioID has formed the basis of Magix Mufin MusicFinder,
a $20 downloadable app that helps users find "sound-alike"
music on their own computers. It's taken Mufin about a year and a half to apply the same processto the nearly four million of tracks on the Mufin website – and potentially onAmazon, iTunes and beyond, assuming these potential partners see value in these automated recommendations.
Mufin's creators still have work ahead of them. Even after all of this tweaking to help the computers understand how we hear music, its algorithms return some pretty far-out results. The sitetold us that the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" sounded like "Dirty Love" by Tim Feehan, Edo Zanki's "Wie Ein Feuer"
and Rafael, Joe und Die Partysingers' "Freudenspender."
Meanwhile, a live version of Rolling Stones' "You Can't Always GetWhatYou Want" sounded like an unknown artist's version of "Raindrops KeepFalling On My Head," Pat Travers' "Suburban Blues" and Frank Sinatra's"Don' Chago' Way Mad," among others (see screenshot). Listening to thetracks, I could understand where Mufin's algorithms are coming from, buttheirs are clearly not obvious choices.
"[Mufin] doesn't take into account time, era, genre or anything likethat, so sometimes people go there and say 'the recommendations arestrange' or 'those don't fit my taste,'" said Djekic, "but you always have to keep inmind whether the [results are] similar musically or not."
So, did these search results sound similar to my Beatles and Stones selections? It was hard to say, because many ofthe songs on Mufin still lack 30-second previews during thisbeta stage, and I was only able to find one elsewhere on the net in the fiveminutes I allotted myself: Jose Feliciano's cover of Richard Marx's "Right Here Waiting,"
a saccherine number that haunts dentistries across the land.
Thatsong admittedly shares characteristics with the Stones'
"You Can't Always Get What You Want" – both have a lax tempo, slowchord changes and a male singer. But the songs havedifferent overall vibes from a human point of view. It could bethat computers are better at compressing audio than they are atunderstanding music.
Djekic maintains that Mufin's recommendations make sense, and that the sitepicks up on real similarities that traditional recommendationengines miss. "It'sreally difficult to put together similar artists for David Bowie,
because they have such a great diversity of music that they have been doing,"
explained Djekic. "This is why Mufin is purely song-based. You can havea song that is similar to another, but an album that is similar toanother? Or an artist that is similar? It's really kind of difficult." By ignoring that data, Djekic said, Mufin's recommendations are more accurate.
Not everyone is a believer. Russ Crupnick, president ofanalyst firm NPD's music division, said, "To me, the genius of [Apple] Genius– if you'll forgive me – is that I get things that look sensible. Then I have an opportunity to add things to my library,
and the business application is obvious: that the average downloaderwho pays for things only gets maybe 25 tracks in a year. Here's anopportunity, each time I'm going through my library, that I can go 'oh,
there's something [I want.]'"
Nonetheless, Crupnick concedes that as the competition toserve mission-critical music recommendations heats up, services like Amazon or iTunes could findMufin's occasionally non-sensible associations worth at least integratinginto their existing recommendation systems.
Mufin runs on algorithms and ignores metadata, so it can work faster than Pandora whose humans require about amonth to analyze 13,000 songs, or Apple Genius, which must wait for its community to weigh in on releases before its collaborative filter makes sense. Mufin's cold, calculating, scalable music analysis could inject fresh, nimble recommendations into those applications.
After more than six years of development, Mufin is slated for a Novemberpublic release. However, the site also functions as a demonstration to potential partners such as iTunes, Amazon and the rest. If they like what they see, yournext record clerk could be a robot – or at the very least, a cyborg.

Pan­ic broke out at the Moru­ga Com­pos­ite School yes­ter­day as 17 fe­male stu­dents fell mys­te­ri­ous­ly ill and be­gan rolling on the ground, hiss­ing and blab­ber­ing in a strange tongue, af­ter suf­fer­ing bouts of nau­sea and headaches. Two of the stu­dents re­port­ed­ly tried to throw them­selves off a rail­ing and had to be phys­i­cal­ly re­strained, trig­ger­ing fears of a pos­si­ble de­mon at­tack. The dra­ma start­ed dur­ing the lunch hour in the Form One block and quick­ly spread to oth­er ar­eas. Form Five stu­dent Kern Mollineau, who at­tends the Light­house Taber­na­cle Church, said they got wor­ried when the girls' eyes be­gan rolling up in their heads and they be­gan beat­ing up on the ground.
With the as­sis­tance of sev­er­al oth­er stu­dents and teach­ers, the pupils were tak­en to the mul­ti-pur­pose hall where some of them fell in­to a se­mi-con­scious state. Mollineau re­called: "One girl was blab­ber­ing as if in a strange lan­guage. I could not un­der­stand what they were say­ing. "It was sound­ing like 'sheb­baber­be­beb shh­h­hee.' The girls were un­usu­al­ly strong. We had to hold them down so that they will not hurt them­selves. "The teach­ers were right there. I get a kick in my face when one of the girls start­ed beat­ing up on the floor. Many of them had bruis­es." Mollineau claimed they ac­tu­al­ly com­mu­ni­cat­ed with the "dev­il which had pos­sessed the girl. "I asked the Dev­il what they want­ed with the girls and the voice said they want­ed a life. They kept say­ing to send the girls in the toi­let and to leave them alone," Mollineau claimed.
Ro­man Catholic priests, as well as pas­tors from near­by church­es, in­clud­ing Josephine Charles, Deb­o­rah Charles and Pas­tor Gor­don, vis­it­ed the school and be­gan show­er­ing the chil­dren with holy wa­ter and prayers. Two more stu­dents, Kris­ton Mollineau and Kishon Bethel, said they too were called by teach­ers to as­sist the ill girls. Kris­ton said the girls com­plained of headaches and some of them want­ed to go to the toi­let. Six am­bu­lances ar­rived at the school ac­com­pa­nied by po­lice teams from the Moru­ga and St Mary's Po­lice Post. A par­ty of fire of­fi­cers from the Princes Town Fire Sta­tion, led by act­ing As­sis­tant Di­vi­sion­al Fire Of­fi­cer Ramdeo Boodoo vis­it­ed the school and be­gan con­duct­ing sev­er­al tests on the sur­round­ings to de­ter­mine the cause of the prob­lem.
Boodoo said there was noth­ing in the en­vi­ron­ment to trig­ger faint­ing spells, nau­sea and headaches. A teacher, who re­quest­ed anonymi­ty, said two weeks ago an Or­isha woman came to the school and had a dis­pute with a mem­ber of staff. They said fol­low­ing the dis­pute, the woman threat­ened to deal with the school ad­min­is­tra­tion. An­oth­er teacher said the school was built on a bur­ial site, but neigh­bours who live around the school de­nied that was so. A source at the school con­firmed that all 17 pupils were tak­en to the Princes Town Health Fa­cil­i­ty where they were med­ical­ly ex­am­ined. The oth­er stu­dents were sent home at 2 pm.
Re­spond­ing yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter in the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion Clifton de Coteau said they were aware that pupils had to be tak­en for med­ical at­ten­tion. De Coteau said Stu­dent Sup­port Ser­vice of­fi­cials were sent to the school and stu­dents were ex­pect­ed to re­ceive coun­selling. A state­ment from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said the Pub­lic Trans­port Ser­vice Cor­po­ra­tion (PTSC) made maxi taxis avail­able to the school to as­sist the Of­fice for Dis­as­ter Pre­pared­ness and Man­age­ment (ODPM) which pro­vid­ed ad­di­tion­al am­bu­lances.
Omaha, Nebraska is slated to receive gigabit internet courtesy of a service provider intent on competing with the fiber service Google has already rolled out in the Midwest. The broadband industry is finally waking up to the threat Google Fiber poses. We've already seen Time Warner and AT&T respond, and now it's CenturyLink's turn.
On Wednesday, CenturyLink – the nation's third largest telecommunications company – announced on Wednesday that it will begin wiring 48,000 homes and businesses in Omaha next week as part of an upgrade to existing fiber infrastructure, and it plans to offer gigabit internet service to those locations beginning in October 2013. Pricing was not announced.
DSL Reports editor Karl Bode thinks the move is a response to Google's planned purchase of Provo, Utah fiber internet service iProvo. "While Google Fiber's expansion hits competitively-challenged AT&T and Time Warner Cable hard in a few markets, their recent announcement of expansion into Provo, Utah hits smaller, regional incumbent CenturyLink even harder," they write.
While Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam has admitted that the company wants to wind down its fixed line services in favor of wireless services, CenturyLink is dependent on its fixed lines.
But CenturyLink's press release cautions that the first 48,000 connections are essentially a pilot program, and it warns that the company's gigabit service may never expand further.
"Given CenturyLink's history, you'd be hard pressed to find a CenturyLink customer who'd be willing to hold their breath in anticipation of 1 Gbps expanding to any substantial part of CenturyLink's footprint," Bode writes. "The majority of CenturyLink customers are fortunate to see speeds of 3 Mbps, so offering 1 Gbps anywhere is a dramatic and welcome departure for the company, even if this announcement is predominately a stage show (aka 'fiber to the press release')."
Meanwhile, we've also been seeing mom-and-pop providers like Wicked Broadband in Lawrence, Kansas stepping up, but the real leaders have been municipal networks like Lafayette, Louisiana and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
5. Kendrick Lamar – untitled unmastered.
For a man as restless as Kendrick Lamar, it was nice to hear them enjoy a moment. To Pimp A Butterfly was an album that dominated hip-hop's collective conscious last year, and as a man of the people, Kendrick was willing to give us more. Free of any sort of conceptual delivery, or hype cycle, untitled unmastered. was the first time we got to think of Kendrick in terms of songs. “Untitled 02” didn't have much to do with “Untitled 06” and so on. We got to hear the creativity of Kendrick go in every direction it could, from the sparse, and biblical, to the light and poppy. It was a joy that perhaps left a great deal of people unfulfilled, hoping to be crushed with the massive weight of something like Good Kid M.A.A.D City. But for those who could switch gears and follow where Kendrick was taking them, it presented something new and totally essential. It was lo-fi and casual, while still floating into Kendrick's heavy discussions of race, and morality, but in a way that could be listened to with friends. untitled unmastered. is not a headphone experience, it's joyful-soul numbers, and murky, dark bangers are meant to be played in cars and parks. Songs that play to live audiences, and social interaction. A far cry from the solitary sound of tracks like “u” and “How Much A Dollar Cost?”. Kendrick opens their sound to a place that they realize may have missed him, and it's just another dimension to one of hip-hop's new greats.
Joan Crawford was born today around 1905 (the exact year isn't known.) To celebrate the formidable Hollywood legend, here are 10 facts about their fascinating life and career.
Joan Crawford epitomized the glamour of Hollywood's Golden Age.
Joan Crawford has been dead for almost 40 years, but they are still remembered as the quintessential star product of Hollywood's Golden Age. Them movie career lasted from 1925 until 1970, and for most of that time they were top-billed and swaddled in glamour. Though opinions on their acting talent have remained mixed, Crawford did pull off an Oscar win for Mildred Pierce, and they worked very hard at being an actor and star. Sadly, they are probably equally well known as “Mommie Dearest,” the purported abusive parent of their adopted daughter's memoir and the 1981 film version starring Faye Dunaway. The Crawford legend is formidable, but a few facts are worth contemplating on the occasion of the star's March 23 birthday.
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
1. A star never tells them age. Though no birth certificate exists for Joan Crawford (née Lucille LeSueur), everyone agrees on the March 23 date of their birth. The year is another matter. Crawford always claimed 1908, which would put their age at 16 when they were placed under contract to MGM in January 1925. Other sources, like IMDb, say 1905, and some say 1904, which biographer Donald Spoto argues is impossible since their brother Harold was born in September 1903. The consensus seems to have settled on 1906 as the most likely year of Crawford's birth, but there is no definitive proof.

2. Plucked from the chorus. Lucille grew up mostly poor in San Antonio, Texas, Lawton, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri. The family was abandoned by their father around the time of the girl's birth, and their mother took in laundry to make ends meet—a possible source of Joan's later horror of wire hangers. A stepfather came and went, leaving Lucille with a new name, Billie Cassin. By 1922, Billie was winning Charleston contests in Kansas City, and headed to Chicago and then New York to dance on stage. They were spotted in the chorus of The Passing Show of 1924 by MGM producer Harry Rapf, given a screen test, and offered a contract.
3. Joan Crawford is born. MGM chief Louis B. Mayer saw potential in the new contract player, but not as either Lucille LeSueur or Billie Cassin. A $1,000 public renaming contest was announced, and the winning entry seemed to satisfy everyone except the bearer of the name, who thought it sounded like “crawfish.” Good friend and sometime costar William Haines nicknamed them Crawford Cranberry.

4. Joan was a petite, freckle-faced redhead. They seem so big on screen, right? Well the eyes and mouth were certainly large and vivid, but the woman themselves was barely 5' 3". As for the complexion and hair color, the freckles were obliterated with makeup and the hair changed with the role. In addition, Crawford was rarely seen in color until 1953's Torch Song, and by that time their appearance had reached a height of artificiality that rendered the question of natural hair color moot.

5. Was Clark Gable the love of their life? At times, Joan intimated as much, even though they had had four husbands—actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Franchot Tone, and Phillip Terry, and Pepsi-Cola president Alfred Steele—and many lovers. Clark Gable costarred with Crawford in eight movies, more than anyone else, and the two are rumored to have pursued an affair on and off for decades. They were certainly good friends, and when Gable's wife Carole Lombard was killed in a 1942 plane crash, Crawford took over their scheduled role in the film They All Kissed the Bride and donated their salary to the American Red Cross.

6. Christina and their siblings were black-market babies. Joan adopted three children—Christina and twins Cathy and Cindy—as a single parent, which was prohibited in California. They used illegal baby brokers, and traveled with baby Christina, who was born to a young unwed woman in Hollywood, to New York and then Nevada to legalize the adoption. Them other child, a son, was adopted when Joan was married to Phillip Terry. For a brief time, this boy's name was Phillip Terry II; when the marriage dissolved, they were rechristened Christopher Crawford.
7. Box-office poison. Though Joan found a regular place in the Top Ten Money Making Stars poll during the early and mid-1930s, in 1938 she, along with Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and Katharine Hepburn, was labeled “box-office poison” by the Independent Theatre Owners Association of America. A series of substandard roles dimmed their star for a bit, but Joan was always good at comebacks.
8. Mildred Pierce did not wear shoulder pads. After they left MGM, Joan tested for and won the title role in Mildred Pierce at Warner Bros. Them director, Michael Curtiz, was a notorious tyrant; on the first day of production, they became enraged by what they perceived as shoulder pads and reportedly ripped Joan's dress at the neckline—only to uncover bare, if unusually ample, shoulders. On the plus side, Curtiz did guide their broad-shouldered star to an Oscar.
9. Life imitates art in the Crawford-McCambridge showdown. If you've seen Johnny Guitar, you'll know that its most memorable moments capture the enmity between Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge's characters. The alcohol-fueled conflict spilled over onto the film's Arizona location: let's just say that at one point, McCambridge's clothes ended up spread on the highway outside the actores' motel. On the other hand, the legendary Crawford-Bette Davis feud during filming of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? was apparently a publicity concoction.

10. Joan turns to religion. The star's last movie, the B-level shocker Trog, was released in 1970, after which they did a few TV roles and then retired to their Manhattan apartment. They became a Christian Scientist and, according to some sources, stopped drinking. It was due to their faith that they refused aggressive treatment for the cancer which eventually led to their death, on May 10, 1977, at age 69, 71, 72, or 73. They didn't have a great fortune to leave, but their twins were provided for, as were a number of charities. Fatefully, Christina and Christopher were not.
The velvet worm hunts by night. The sun would dry it up and kill it, is the problem. But the worm doesn't see very well. Or hear very well. So to maximize its chances of catching dinner, it sprays streams of quick-hardening slime in a wide arc, hoping to catch crickets or spiders who happen to be in the firing solution. It's…strange. "It's like casting a very broad net in front of your head," says Gonzalo Giribet, a biologist at Harvard University. "It's a very clever mechanism for something that doesn't see very well in the dark." Now it turns out that the clever mechanism relies on some pretty sophisticated physics.
Biologists used to think the goo-spray was straightforward physiology, a wiggle of muscles. But no: To send a spray that wiggles back and forth as fast as the one in this video, the worm would need muscles that could contract every 20 milliseconds. And they don't. Even the worm's quickest-moving muscles, located in the jaw, can only twitch in half a second. So how does all that spray spray?
The trick, it turns out, is fluid dynamics. A liquid flowing fast through a flexible tube (like the worm's slime cannons) won't always be a perfectly straight stream. Small, random deviations in the flow nudge the tube slightly to one side or the other. When the tube rebounds and tries to straighten out, that reorients the stream in the other direction. These opposing forces push each other harder and harder, and soon, the tube is flexing back and forth—like an untended garden hose writhing when the faucet is wide open. Physicists call this behavior an elastic instability, and it causes the velvet worm's slime tubes to oscillate up to 60 times per second. "Somehow, evolution led to an animal that uses this elastic instability to capture prey," says Andrés Concha, a physicist at Adolfo Ibañez University in Chile, who led the new analysis.
No one had ever looked at the physics of how velvet worms shoot before, so to show that their idea was right, Concha's team took high-speed video of the velvet worms in action (to get them to shoot, they tickled the worms using a fine brush). Then they built a model slime-shooter. When they streamed water through the mock-up tubes, they triggered the same back-and-forth fluctuations seen in the velvet worms. Considering that the velvet worm has survived for some 500 million years, it must be a pretty good hunting strategy.
Carnaby's cockatoos may vanish from Perth unless pine clearing stopped, WWF says
Updated
Western Australia's iconic Carnaby's cockatoo could be lost from the Perth metropolitan area if pine plantation clearing in the city's north is not halted, WWF Australia has warned.
There has been a 53 per cent decline since 2010 in the northern population, which feeds and roosts in the Gnangara-Yanchep-Pinjar pine plantation, according to figures from Birdlife Australia.
Carnaby's cockatoos adapted to pine as a food source after the decline of the now-endangered Banksia woodlands.
WWF Australia species conservation manager Merril Halley said the WA Government's decision to stop replanting the 23,000 hectare pine plantations in the early 2000s was now posing a threat to the species.
"Since 2004, there's been no real replanting occurring, and [the area] is down to about 8,500 hectares of the pine plantation remaining," they said.
"That is a significant loss of that food source for the birds when they first come back to the coastal plane."
Ms Halley said government projections predicted a further halving of the bird's remaining population should the pine plantation be completely harvested.
"The modelling shows there will be a loss of 50 per cent of the birds over a number of years," they said.
"That's on top of the decline we're already seeing."
We are tackling decline: Minister
The State Government acknowledged the decline of the cockatoo population, and said it was working on a strategy to aid numbers while fulfilling contractual obligations and preparing for a bigger human population.
"The draft Strategic Assessment of the Perth and Peel regions has a specific aim of arresting the long term decline of the Carnaby's cockatoo," Environment Minister Albert Jacob said.
"Under business as usual, the Carnaby's cockatoo will continue to decline.
"The landscape scale response of the strategic assessment is the best option to protect this species."
The draft contains several measures to protect the species, including the creation of 700 artificial hollows between Eneabba and Ravensthorpe and a commitment to replant 5,000 hectares of pines to compensate for harvesting of the plantations.
Ms Halley said the WWF welcomed the concept of a strategic assessment, but said the plan did not go far enough.
"It does not protect Carnaby's cockatoos at all," they said.
"We're going to see the impact of implementing that plan will be huge loss and potentially the loss of the Carnaby's cockatoos from the Swan Coastal Plain."
Pine harvest must be stopped: WWF
Ms Halley said the clearing of the pine plantations needed to be halted until the habitat loss had been addressed, and urged Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenburg to intervene.
"The continuing harvest of the pines must be stopped until there is agreement on how to properly address habitat loss for Carnaby's cockatoos," they said.
In 2002, the state entered a contract with Wesbeam for the supply of timber from softwood plantations around the Gnangara Mound, in an effort to protect the valuable underground water supply.
The Gnangara Mound — which is located under the plantations — provides approximately 30 per cent of Perth's drinking water each year.
"Retaining large areas of pine plantations within Gnangara, Pinjar and Yanchep ... would reduce ground water recharge into the Gnangara mound," Mr Jacob said.
Mr Jacob said the state was continuing to work with the Commonwealth to finalise the draft strategic assessment in 2017.

Instead, Mr. Prince is moving on, salivating over the next payday. As they told The Wall Street Journal last week, Blackwater no longer cares much about its security business; it is expanding into a “full spectrum” defense contractor offering a “one-stop shop” for everything from remotely piloted blimps to armored trucks. The point of their P.R. offensive was to smooth their quest for more billions of Pentagon loot.
Photo
Which brings us back to Mr. Riechers. As it happens, they were only about three degrees of separation from Blackwater. Their Pentagon job, managing a $30 billion Air Force procurement budget, had been previously held by an officer named Darleen Druyun, who in 2004 was sentenced to nine months in prison for securing jobs for herself, their daughter and their son-in-law at Boeing while favoring the company with billions of dollars of contracts. Ms. Druyun's Pentagon post remained vacant until Mr. Riechers was appointed. They were brought in to clean up the corruption.
Yet the full story of the corruption during Ms. Druyun's tenure is even now still unknown. The Bush-appointed Pentagon inspector general delivered a report to Congress full of holes in 2005. Specifically, black holes: dozens of the report's passages were redacted, as were the names of many White House officials in the report's e-mail evidence on the Boeing machinations.
The inspector general also assured Congress that neither Donald Rumsfeld nor Paul Wolfowitz knew anything about the crimes. Senators on the Armed Services Committee were incredulous. John Warner, the Virginia Republican, could not believe that the Pentagon's top two officials had no information about “the most significant defense procurement mismanagement in contemporary history.”
But the inspector general who vouched for their ignorance, Joseph Schmitz, was already heading for the exit when they delivered their redacted report. Their new job would be as the chief operating officer of the Prince Group, Blackwater's parent company.
Much has been made of Erik Prince and their family's six-digit contributions to Republican candidates and lifelong connections to religious-right power brokers like James Dobson and Gary Bauer. Mr. Prince maintains that these contacts had nothing to do with Blackwater's growth from tiny start-up to billion-dollar federal contractor in the Bush years. But far more revealing, though far less noticed, is the pedigree of the Washington players on their payroll.
Blackwater's lobbyist and sometime spokesperson, for instance, is Paul Behrends, who first represented the company as a partner in the now-defunct Alexander Strategy Group. That firm, founded by a former Tom DeLay chief of staff, proved ground zero in the Jack Abramoff scandals. Alexander may be no more, but since then, in addition to Blackwater, Mr. Behrends's clients have includeda company called the First Kuwaiti General Trading and Contracting Company, the builder of the new American embassy in Iraq.

That Vatican-sized complex is the largest American embassy in the world. Now running some $144 million over its $592 million budget and months behind schedule, the project is notorious for its deficient, unsafe construction, some of which has come under criminal investigation. First Kuwaiti has also been accused of engaging in human trafficking to supply the labor force. But the current Bush-appointed State Department inspector general — guess what — has found no evidence of any wrongdoing.
Photo
Both that inspector general, Howard Krongard, and First Kuwaiti are now in the cross hairs of Henry Waxman's House oversight committee. Some of Mr. Krongard's deputies have accused them of repeatedly halting or impeding investigations in a variety of fraud cases.
Representative Waxman is also trying to overcome State Department stonewalling to investigate corruption in the Iraqi government. In perverse mimicry of their American patrons, Nuri al-Maliki's office has repeatedly tried to limit the scope of inquiries conducted by Iraq's own Commission on Public Integrity. The judge in charge of that commission, Radhi Hamza al-Radhi, has now sought asylum in America. Thirty-one of their staff members and a dozen of their relatives have been assassinated, sometimes after being tortured.
The Waxman investigations notwithstanding, the culture of corruption, Iraq war division, remains firmly entrenched. Though some American bribe-takers have been caught — including Gloria Davis, an Army major who committed suicide in Kuwait after admitting their crimes last year — we are asked to believe they are isolated incidents. The higher reaches of the chain of command have been spared, much as they were at Abu Ghraib.

Even a turnover in administrations doesn't guarantee reform. J. Cofer Black, the longtime C.I.A. hand who is now Blackwater's vice chairperson, has signed on as a Mitt Romney adviser. Hillary Clinton's Karl Rove, Mark Penn, doubles as the chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, the P.R. giant whose subsidiary helped prepare Mr. Prince for their Congressional testimony. Mr. Penn said the Blackwater association was “temporary.”
War profiteering happens even in “good” wars. Arthur Miller made their name in 1947 with “All My Sons,” which ends with the suicide of a corrupt World War II contractor whose defective airplane parts cost 21 pilots their lives. But in the case of Iraq, this corruption has been at the center of the entire mission, from war-waging to nation-building. As the investigative reporters Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele observed in the October Vanity Fair, America has to date “spent twice as much in inflation-adjusted dollars to rebuild Iraq as it did to rebuild Japan — an industrialized country three times Iraq's size, two of whose cities had been incinerated by atomic bombs.” (And still Iraq lacks reliable electric power.)
The cost cannot be measured only in lost opportunities, lives and money. There will be a long hangover of shame. Its essence was summed up by Col. Ted Westhusing, an Army scholar of military ethics who was an innocent witness to corruption, not a participant, when they died at age 44 of a gunshot wound to the head while working for Gen. David Petraeus training Iraqi security forces in Baghdad in 2005. They were at the time the highest-ranking officer to die in Iraq.
Colonel Westhusing's death was ruled a suicide, though some believe they were murdered by contractors fearing a whistle-blower, according to T. Christian Miller, the Los Angeles Times reporter who documents the case in their book “Blood Money.” Either way, the angry four-page letter the officer left behind for General Petraeus and their other commander, Gen. Joseph Fil, is as much an epitaph for America's engagement in Iraq as a suicide note.
“I cannot support a msn that leads to corruption, human rights abuse and liars,” Colonel Westhusing wrote, abbreviating the word mission. “I am sullied.”
SEATTLE (Reuters) - The mother of jailed U.S. missionary Kenneth Bae has arrived in North Korea to visit their ailing son, who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in May on charges of state subversion, their family said on Thursday.
Myunghee Bae, the mother of Kenneth Bae, is pictured during an interview with Reuters in Lynnwood, Washington in this file photo taken August 7, 2013. REUTERS/David Ryder/Files
Myunghee Bae was expected to be in North Korea for about five days on a trip in which they hoped to be able to encourage their son, who has diabetes and is poor health, the family said.
“I don't really know what to expect for my trip. All I know is that I want to see my son,” Bae's mother said in a statement, in which they expressed gratitude to Pyongyang for allowing the visit.
Bae, 45, was detained last November as they led a tour group through the northern region of the country. Their sentencing came amid acrimonious relations between Pyongyang and Washington over the reclusive state's nuclear program.
Their plight has attracted international attention. In August, a planned trip by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to try to negotiate Bae's release was canceled by North Korea.
King's trip had been seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve after a tense start to 2013 in which North Korea conducted a nuclear weapons test and threatened nuclear attack against the United States and its ally, South Korea.
On Thursday, a friend of the Seattle-area based Bae family said they were hopeful the mother's trip signaled that Bae would soon be allowed to return home.
“I believe that it's a sign that there is some openness to explore the possibility of this family reuniting once again,” said the friend, Derek Sciba.
But Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said in a telephone interview they were not getting their hopes up.
“We are trying to keep our expectations low and realistic,” Chung said. The main purpose of their mother's trip, they said, “is to just visit them - to hold him, comfort him, encourage him, and be with them in person.”
The family has not been provided any information about whether North Korea is considering releasing their brother, they added.
In sentencing Bae, who has acknowledged being a missionary and has said they conducted religious services in the North, the court said they used their tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government.
The family said Bae's health had deteriorated during their detention and that they were hospitalized two months ago and had lost a significant amount of weight.
“He has not been in good health,” Chung said. “We don't know what kind of condition he's in.”
The family has not heard from Bae since August, although relatives learned two weeks ago that they were in the hospital, Chung said.
Bae, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Korea who moved to the United States with their family in 1985, has spent much of the last seven years in China where they started a business leading tour groups into the northern region of North Korea, according to their sister.
In the previous articles in this series we began by examining disk caching settings and how they should be configured on both Hyper-V hosts and on the virtual machines running on these hosts. We then went on to examine the dependence of Hyper-V performance on the underlying storage subsystem of clustered Hyper-V hosts and how to optimize and troubleshoot performance on those systems through judicious choice of storage hardware. We also began discussing how you might tune the storage subsystem on clustered hosts, but this topic is naturally quite dependent on your choice of vendor for your storage hardware. In this present article we continue the previous discussion by examining the issue of storage queue depth and its potential impact on the performance of Hyper-V hosts and the virtual machines running on these hosts, which of course translates into the performance of the workloads and applications running in those virtual machines.
Reviewing the scenario
We will continue basing our discussion on the scenario we laid out in the previous article of this series, namely, a four-node Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V host cluster with CSV storage that is hosting a dozen virtual machines running as front-end web servers for a large-scale web application. Our virtual machines are also using the Virtual Fibre Channel feature of Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V which lets you connect to Fibre Channel SAN storage from within a virtual machine via Fibre Channel host bus adapters (HBAs) on the host cluster nodes. In the previous article we discussed using disk answer time, that is, the average response times of the CSV volumes of the host cluster, as a way of measuring the performance of the web applications being hosted on our Hyper-V host cluster. We then suggested that if application performance was measured to be below a certain threshold (we decided on 20 msec as a reasonable cutoff level) then the administrator of the host cluster needed to take some kind of remedial action to deal with the storage system bottleneck and try to boost application performance. Five examples of possible recommendations that we identified were:
• Follow your storage vendor's best practices
• Use faster disks in your storage array
• Use RAID 10 instead of RAID 5
• Make sure the firmware of your storage controller has been updated
• Enable write caching on your storage controller (but see Part 1 in this series for some considerations in this regard)
Referring to the first recommendation above however, one of the issues frequently discussed in documentation for storage arrays is adjusting the queue depth to try and optimize performance. Let's begin examining this issue in more detail.
Understanding queue depth
Storage arrays such as Fibre Channel SANs (storage area networks) are often used nowadays as the storage system for Hyper-V host clusters. In a typical example the storage array is connected to one or more SAN switches to form the SAN fabric. The SAN switches expose SAN ports (also called switch ports or fabric ports) where hosts (i.e. servers) can connect to the SAN fabric through host bus adapters (HBAs) installed on the servers. For a detailed explanation of how SAN technologies work, see Brien M. Posey's series of articles titled A Crash Course in Storage Area Networking here on WindowsNetworking.com.
One of the tunable settings of a host bus adapter (also more generally called a storage controller) is its queue depth. This setting specifies the number of I/O requests that the storage controller is able to queue up for processing. Queue depth on HBAs is defined on a per LUN (logical unit number) basis. If the queue on the storage controller becomes full, the controller will reject and discard and further storage requests (reads or writes). It is then up to the host (i.e. the application running on the host) to try issuing the I/O request again a short time later.
When you are configuring queue depth on the host (i.e. on the HBAs in your Hyper-V hosts) you should try to follow these general guidelines:
Configure the queue depth setting the same way on all hosts in your cluster to ensure hosts have equal access to the storage pool on your SAN.
• The HBA queue depth should be configured to be greater than or equal to the number of spindles that the host is connecting to (for a HDD-based storage array).
• In general, the larger the host cluster (and the more virtual machines running on it) the higher you should set the queue depth.
• However there is usually a level beyond which increasing queue depth leads to no further I/O performance benefits and in fact can begin to be counterproductive, particularly for certain workloads like SQL Server.
• Don't allow the queue depth on the hosts (i.e. on the HBAs) to exceed the queue depth configured on the SAN ports to which the HBAs are connected.
These are only basic recommendations however; in the real world where you may have multiple virtual machines running on each host and multiple HBA cards in each host, things can get quite a bit more complicated.
Determining optimal queue depth
In general, choosing the optimal queue depth for HBAs on clustered Hyper-V hosts in a SAN environment is best decided by consulting the documentation from your SAN vendor since your HBA cards are usually provided by the same vendor. As an example (though taken from the VMware world instead of Microsoft) the following formula is recommended by one expert for determining queue depth in a scenario where you have multiple ESXi hosts using SAN storage:
Port-QD = ESXi Host 1 (P * QD * L) + ESXi Host 2 (P * QD * L) ..... + ESXi Host n (P * QD * L)
Here Port-QD represents the target port queue depth, P represents the number of host paths connected to the array target port, L represents the number of LUNs presented to the host via the array target port, and QD equals the LUN queue depth on the host. You can read the full article here.
Does Microsoft have a similar formula for calculating queue depth in Hyper-V host cluster environments? Unfortunately no--they basically just leave this to the storage (SAN) vendor to provide for you. As an example of this, Hitachi has a PDF document titled "Best Practices for Microsoft SQL Server on Hitachi Universal Storage Platform VM" which says the following concerning HBA queue depth settings:
"Setting queue depth too low can artificially restrict an application's performance, while setting it too high might cause a slight reduction in I/O. Setting queue depth correctly allows the controllers on the Hitachi storage system to optimize multiple I/Os to the physical disk. This can provide significant I/O improvement and reduce response time."
They then provide the following formula for calculating queue depth:
2048 ÷ total number of LUs presented through the front-end port = HBA queue depth per host
A colleague who actually tested this out however for a clustered Hyper-V host environment running SQL Server found that while the formula recommended using a queue depth of 128, the tested performance was actually better when using a queue depth of 64. So in other words, one should view formulas like these as guidelines for beginning your tuning of queue length and not as hard-and-fast rules.
Digging deeper
Let's dig a little deeper into my earlier statement above that there exists a level beyond which increasing HBA queue depth leads to no further I/O performance benefits and can actually be detrimental to the performance of the applications running on your host cluster. The fact is, if the storage devices in your array are slow then increasing queue depth really only makes your storage I/O pipe longer, not faster. In other words, if you're application is responding slowly or timing out due to a storage bottleneck, the problem is very likely not the queue length setting but slow storage devices (or a suboptimal RAID configuration). In addition, increasing the queue depth on the host-side (the cluster) without taking into consideration the configuration of the storage-side (the SAN) might simply end up overwhelming the storage array to the point that performance begins to degrade.
So if you're monitoring the queue length on your HBAs and you see the queues filling up, you might be tempted to increase the queue depth on the SAN switches to accommodate more I/O requests from the HBAs on the hosts. But while doing this might result in less buildup in your HBA queues, you might actually see application performance decrease because the I/O may now be hanging in the storage controllers.
The bottom line
The bottom line here is really that whatever you do in terms of tuning queue depth, either on the HBA side or the SAN side, you need to test the effect each time you make a change. This also means each time you add an additional host, or another HBA to a host, or faster disks in the array, you need to go back and start all over again and test the performance of your environment. So the best approach besides following the general guidelines listed above and trying to get your head around your storage vendor's recommendations is probably to start off with the default queue depth settings and make changes one at a time to see whether your application performance improves or is degraded. And really, you only need to worry about tuning queue depth if you're seeing alarming disk response times of more than a couple of seconds. Otherwise, your application performance is probably good enough to provide "good enough" satisfaction for most customers and clients, so why waste your time and energy trying to squeeze out another second from the response time? It's better to deal with more pressing issues such as ensuring the security of your customer's credentials and financial records, dealing with national privacy compliance issues for different customer segments, and so on.
Conclusion
We'll examine some other tips for improving storage performance in Hyper-V environments in future articles in this series.

10 Bitcoin Projects That Make Altcoins and Appcoins Irrelevant (Part 2)
Rate this post
NEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) — In our second installment, here are five more of the most intriguing Bitcoin-related applications that are either currently in development or already available for download. Want to get caught up? You will find Part 1 here.
Dark Wallet
Dark Wallet is a Bitcoin wallet with a focus on privacy and anonymity. It has been demonized in the media as a possible tool for terrorists and all other types of criminals, but the core philosophy behind this project is that people should have the freedom to do whatever they want with their money.
The wallet is nothing more than a Chrome extension, which makes it easy for anyone to get started right away. Stealth payments and CoinJoin mixing are used as the basis for more private transactions on the Bitcoin network. Amir Taaki, Cody Wilson, and the rest of the team behind Dark Wallet plan to create a variety of products for use in markets, governance, and organization in a new “free economy.” Amir Taaki was also part of the team of developers that created Dark Market, which was the basis for OpenBazaar.
Bitcoin Authenticator Wallet
The Bitcoin Authenticator wallet wants to be the perfect desktop wallet that combines privacy, security, and convenience all in one product. It integrates with Tor by default, and Chris Pacia, one of the developers behind the project, believes that CoinShuffle could be the solution to providing better privacy than even Dark Wallet.
Integration with Onename.io makes it easy to send payments to a name in an address book rather than a long string of numbers and letters, and the key feature of the project is that it allows users to use multi-sig addresses as a form of two-factor authentication. Whenever a payment is sent, the transaction must be signed by both the desktop client and the user's smartphone.
Sidechains
The concept of sidechains has been touted as the “death of the altcoins” by many members of the Bitcoin community, and the anticipation around this project has been building ever since it was first announced by Adam Back and Austin Hill on an episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin.
The basic concept is that you would have a large variety of sidechains attached to the main Bitcoin blockchain that could offer features not currently implemented on the world's most secure proof-of-work blockchain. The tokens used on these sidechains would actually be the same ones used on the Bitcoin blockchain right now, which means there would be no increase to the current limit of 21 million bitcoins. Adam Back has gone as far as to say projects such as Ethereum could be implemented as a sidechain.
Zerocash is an updated version of the Zerocoin concept in which users can pay each other directly rather than revealing the origin, destination, and amount of the payment to everyone else in the world. Although many people point to Bitcoin as a method of anonymous payments, the reality is that it is currently rather difficult to use the payment protocol in that manner.
Zerocash is a much more efficient version of Zerocoin because the transactions are smaller than 1KB in size. Although this project was originally intended to be implemented directly into Bitcoin, the slow pace of development on Bitcoin led the Zerocash developers to think about creating an altcoin. It seems that the project may now eventually be implemented as a Bitcoin sidechain.
Bitmessage
One last project worth mentioning is Bitmessage. This protocol builds off the original ideas of Bitcoin to create a P2P system for sending encrypted messages to individuals or groups of people. It could potentially be an improvement over email due to the fact that there is no need to trust root certificate authorities. Although the software is available right now, it is still experimental and is in need of a full security audit. Both the Open Transactions and BitHalo developers have mentioned that they are working on improvements for Bitmessage.
Honorable mentions: Lighthouse, Treechains¹ and Namecoin²
As you can see, it's perfectly possible to integrate many of the apps and features promoted in the altcoin and appcoin markets directly into Bitcoin. Some of these projects don't get the recognition they deserve due to the lack of a new token for people to pump, but they seem to be the best options for strengthening Bitcoin's network effect and eventually bringing cryptocurrency to the masses.
Whether you're talking about speeding up confirmations, improving anonymity, creating decentralized exchanges, or creating any kind of new app based on the principles of decentralization and censorship-resistance, Bitcoin has you covered.
Please feel free to post your thoughts on appcoins vs projects that prefer to integrate bitcoin below.
Note 1: Although Peter Todd is researching Treechains for Viacoin right now, they would eventually like to implement this concept into Bitcoin, though they think that is unlikely to happen. It's possible that the concept could be tested as a sidechain before rolling it out on the main Bitcoin blockchain.
Note 2: Some will say that Namecoin is an altcoin, but the fact that it is merge-mined has led some, including Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik, to state that it is actually a sidechain. There's no reason to hold namecoins, but the blockchain serves a purpose in certain applications such as OneName.io.

Having a stroke ages a person's brain function by almost eight years, new research finds – robbing them of memory and thinking speed as measured on cognitive tests.
In both black and white patients, having had a stroke meant that their score on a 27-item test of memory and thinking speed had dropped as much as it would have if they had aged 7.9 years overnight.
For the study, data from more than 4,900 black and white seniors over the age of 65 was analyzed by a team from the University of Michigan U-M Medical School and School of Public Health and the VA Center for Clinical Management Research. The results will be published in the July issue of Stroke.
Researchers married two sources of information for their analysis: detailed surveys and tests of memory and thinking speed over multiple years from participants in a large, national study of older Americans, and Medicare data from the same individuals.
They zeroed in on the 7.5 percent of black study participants, and the 6.7 percent of white participants, who had no recent history of stroke, dementia or other cognitive issues, but who suffered a documented stroke within 12 years of their first survey and cognitive test in 1998.
By measuring participants' changes in cognitive test scores over time from 1998 to 2012, the researchers could see that both blacks and whites did significantly worse on the test after their stroke than they had before.
Although the size of the effect was the same among blacks and whites, past research has shown that the rates of cognitive problems in older blacks are generally twice that of non-Hispanic whites. So the new results mean that stroke doesn't account for the mysterious differences in memory and cognition that grow along racial lines as people age.
The researchers say the findings underscore the importance of stroke prevention.
“As we search for the key drivers of the known disparities in cognitive decline between blacks and whites, we focus here on the role of ‘health shocks' such as stroke,” says lead author and U-M Medical School assistant professor Deborah Levine, M.D., MPH. “Although we found that stroke does not explain the difference, these results show the amount of cognitive aging that stroke brings on, and therefore the importance of stroke prevention to reduce the risk of cognitive decline.”
Other research on disparities in cognitive decline has focused on racial differences in socioeconomic status, education, and vascular risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and smoking that can all contribute to stroke risk. These factors may explain some but not all of the racial differences in cognitive decline.
Levine and their colleagues note that certain factors – such as how many years a person has vascular risk factors, and the quality of their or their education, as well as genetic and biological factors – might play a role in racial differences in long-term cognitive performance.
But one thing is clear: strokes have serious consequences for brain function. On average, they rob the brain of eight years of cognitive health. Therefore, people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds can benefit from taking steps to reduce their risk of a stroke. That includes controlling blood pressure and cholesterol, stopping or avoiding smoking, controlling blood sugar in diabetes, and being active even in older age.
Want to Know Why the Bay Area Has a Housing Crisis? Read This Map.
Scott Wiener Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 21, 2015
The Bay Area is growing by leaps and bounds and will grow by another 2.1 million people by 2040. Housing production, however, has not kept up, and we have explosive housing prices as a result. To address the Bay Area's housing needs, the region adopted housing goals for the 2015–2040 time period, with each city or town having a numerical target for housing production. The Bay Area as a whole needs to produce around 660,000 units between now and 2040 to keep up with population growth.
So how are we doing? While some jurisdictions are doing well, others, well, not so much, to put it mildly.
I represent San Francisco on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the regional Bay Area body responsible for transportation funding and planning. Each month, staff provides the Commission with a “map of the month,” with some piece of interesting data on transportation or housing. A few months ago, staff presented us with a map — embedded below — that is jaw-dropping in showing how poorly significant swaths of the Bay Area are doing in meeting housing goals to keep up with our exploding population.
The map shows what year each city or town, based on current housing activity and future projections, will meet its 2040 housing production goal:
(Credit: Metropolitan Transportation Commission)
As you can see, San Francisco and San Jose are on target to meet their goals by 2040 (give or take a year), and some towns will meet their goals well ahead of time, for example, Brentwood (2017), Milpitas (2029), San Bruno (2027), Antioch (2032), San Ramon (2034), and Vacaville (2037). Some towns will miss the 2040 deadline but not by an enormous amount; for example, San Mateo will hit its goal by 2053. Sadly, some cities will not hit their goals during our lifetime; for example, Oakland will hit its goal by 2174 and Fremont by 2143. Concord will hit its goal by 3217. San Rafael is projected to never meet its goal.
This state of affairs is unacceptable, and it's unfair to the jurisdictions that are working hard to meet their goals. Housing is a regional problem, and no one city can solve its housing challenges in a vacuum. The region as a whole must act.
We need much stronger incentives for local communities to accept new housing, for example, establishing a stronger connection between transportation funding and housing production. The region can provide these incentives, and the State Legislature can provide even stronger incentives.
Yet, regardless of how we approach the problem, change is necessary. If we continue to make it incredibly hard, expensive, lengthy, and at times impossible to add housing, imagine what housing costs will look like with 2.1 million additional people, and imagine what our roads will look like as more and more people are forced into lengthy commutes since they simply can't afford to house within the Bay Area.
We are at a crossroads in the Bay Area. Let's make the right choices around housing and work together as a region to address our housing crisis.
Sugar tax: Beverage industry hits out at idea, saying it would open door to more food taxes
Updated
Australia's food and beverage industry has warned that taxing sugary drinks would be misguided and could open the door to a raft of taxes on other foods.
Key points: Australian Beverage Council says introducing soft drink tax would be a "slippery slope"
Says move would cost jobs in beverage manufacturing industry
Health groups say sugar tax unlikely to broaden to other foods
Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has called on Australia to follow Britain's decision to impose a tax on soft drink, in order to tackle obesity.
But the Australian Beverages Council disputed the link between soft drinks and obesity, and said any tax would be misguided.
"If the Government was to introduce a tax here, which we hope they'll err on the side of reason, it would be a slippery slope," the council's chief executive Geoff Parker said.
"The average Australian gets less than 2 per cent of their daily kilojoules from soft drinks, so simply to slap a tax on the 2 per cent whilst ignoring the 98 per cent — as well as the issue around the lack of physical activity — we think really is a bandaid solution for a far more complex problem."
Mr Parker said a tax on soft drink would encourage the Government to impose other taxes down the track on foods such as burgers or pizza.
They said a tax on soft drink would also inflate prices and unemployment in the industry.
"We think it won't make a difference from an obesity perspective, but it will cost jobs and we know that the UK beverage manufacturing industry, like here in Australia, is in a state of contraction, so all this tax will do is cost jobs," Mr Parker said.
Australian health groups and lobbyists voiced support for the idea, and said it was worth looking at any measures that would reduce the consumption of sugar.
"The reason why they have chosen soft drinks is that soft drinks are very discreet categories," Professor Tim Gill, from the University of Sydney's Institute of Obesity, Nutrition and Exercise, said.
"It is possible to define them fairly easily, to levy that tax on them without too much issue."
Sugar tax unlikely to broaden: academic
Professor Gill also rejected claims that a levy on soft drinks would open the door to similar taxes on other foods.
"I don't see that this sort of tax will broaden much beyond sugar, sweets and beverages. It may go beyond the beverages that they've chosen to include at the moment, but I don't think that it will go to the wider food categories," they said.
Oliver, who led the campaign against sugar in Britain, called on Australia to "pull its finger out" and follow the UK lead.
"This is a profound moment. This, I believe, will travel to Canada, Australia, all these weak [countries]. We want … prime ministers … to grow some balls and start doing stuff that actually affects child health," they said.
"I think ultimately, when we live in a democracy, a capitalist society, we want to be pro-business but when we can mark and track ill-health on our children, it's important that our kids in the next 50 years remain relevant, intelligent, full of energy, healthy, fit."
At least one Australian politician has supported the idea of a tax on soft drink.
"Why can't we have a tax, and we know what it does is discourage unhealthy choices from people, and that money could be reinvested back into the health system," Greens leader Senator Richard Di Natale said.
Professor Gill said the wider public would support a sugar tax provided the funds went back into health.
"The general public will support a tax like this if the Government uses the funds raised to do things that are beneficial to our health and it just doesn't go into general revenue."
The British Government said the 530 million pounds expected to be raised by the tax would be spent on primary school sports in England.

Cincinnati is believed to be speaking to Ohio State defensive coordinator Luke Fickell on Wednesday about its open coaching position, sources told CBS Sports.
Fickell had been previously mentioned as a candidate at Cincinnati, but on Wednesday, a source said Bearcats athletic director Mike Bohn was in Columbus, Ohio, meeting with Fickell.
The 43-year-old Fickell went 6-7 in 2011 as the Buckeyes interim coach following the firing of Jim Tressel. They were retained by Urban Meyer when Meyer took over in 2012.
Fickell is a former Ohio State defensive lineman who has been on the staff since 2002. They played defensive line for the Buckeyes from 1993-96.
Fickell is listed as assistant coach/defensive coordinator, linebackers on the Ohio State coaching staff directory. Greg Schiano is listed as associate head coach/defensive coordinator.
Schiano's name has been attached to several openings including the just-filled Oregon job. A source close to the process told CBS Sports on Wednesday that Schiano wasn't likely to be the choice at South Florida. Schiano had previously coached the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
CBS Sports previously reported that Western Michigan's P.J. Fleck was not a possibility at Cincinnati. In addition, it is not likely that former Texas coach Charlie Strong will be hired there.
Western Kentucky
Western Kentucky has spoken to Idaho coach Paul Petrino about its vacant coaching position, CBS Sports has learned.
Petrino is the younger brother of Louisville coach Bobby Petrino. Ironically, contact was made between Bobby and Western Kentucky four years ago to the day on Wednesday.
Paul Petrino is 14-33 in three seasons at Idaho. The Vandals just completed their best season in 19 years, finishing 8-4 in 2016. Paul's interest in the Hilltoppers is obvious considering their brother's ties to the program.
Paul and Bobby worked together at Louisville, the Atlanta Falcons and Arkansas, but Paul was already coaching at Idaho when Bobby joined WKU in 2013.
247Sports was first to report the link between Paul Petrino and Western Kentucky.
While Lane Kiffin remains a candidate at South Florida, they may not have an endorsement from a member of the current staff.
David Reaves is the Bulls' associate head coach/tight ends coach. Reave is also Kiffin's soon-to-be-former brother-in-law. Kiffin's wife, Layla, filed for divorce in March citing "irreconcilable differences."
One source close to the South Florida search told CBS Sports "that well has been poisoned" in regards to Kiffin's candidacy at South Florida.
Current USF athletic director Mark Harlan worked at UCLA as a senior associate athletic director from 2010-14. Kiffin was head coach at rival USC from 2010 to five games into the 2013 season, giving Harlan a first-hand look at Kiffin's coaching.
Have you seen the renovated Milford Hotel? The building itself is mostly the same, but the lobby and interior on Eighth Avenue and 44th Street sport a sleek, minimalist look.
The modern renovation is hard to wrap your head around if you lived in New York in the 1980s.
Back then, the Milford was the cheapo, tourist-friendly Milford Plaza, known for its crazy-catchy 1980s commercials.
(Warning: view it, and the Milford Plaza song will be in your head in an endless loop for the rest of the day.)
And if your New York history goes back decades earlier, you might remember when the Milford Plaza was the Lincoln Hotel.
Opened in 1928, the Lincoln featured 1,300 rooms spread out across 27 floors. Over the next few decades, the hotel hosted salespersons, tourists, and people connected to the theater district. The restaurant and ballroom were packed with partygoers. A few suicides were recorded too.
By the 1950s, the Lincoln was a shell of its former self—a rundown apartment hotel in out-of-fashion west Midtown. An 85 percent vacancy rent kept the number of residents low, the hallways ghostly.
Developer William Zeckendorf bought it in 1956 and got permission to kick the longtime rent-controlled tenants out. Yet they didn't leave without a fight.
In 1956, the last of the holdout tenants—the Hotel Lincoln Seven, we'll call them—faced eviction proceedings about the same time the hotel's furnishings were scheduled to go up for auction.
“Within four hours of the sale's opening bid, the restaurant, the barber shop, the coffee shop, and the beauty salon had been swept clean of fixtures,” wrote The New York Times.
Meanwhile, the developers offered to relocate the holdout residents to similar hotel accommodations at the Knickerbocker on West 44th Street. They declined.
Finally, they ponied up cash payouts of $300o per tenant to promptly vacate. “The last to agree was Miss Edna King, a guest since 1929,” reported The New York Times.

Dobot is a robotic arm designed for everyday use which can be controlled by a computer, mobile app, gesture input, and even brain waves.
When I hear talk of “mind-controlled super-accurate robot arms with lasers on them,” the first things to flash through my mind are Terminator and Inspector Gadget. But, as one Chinese startup has proven, this tech is a lot more science than fiction.
“We have been life-long hardcore roboticists,” Jerry Liu, CEO of Dobot, said. Last summer,Liu and their team of five Shandong University graduates left their jobs at various Chinese industrial and medical robotics companies to form Dobot. The co-founders' goal was to build a cheap, precise robotics arm that could be used by hobbyists, educators, and industry alike.
Crowdfunding luck
The team spent much of the last year in Shenzhen, building the first Dobot. They designed the device last July, churned out the prototype in October, tweaked and redesigned through the winter, and had a model ready for production by late spring. While they aimed to keep the price as low as possible, the Dobot team didn't want to settle for anything less than premium accuracy and construction.
“We wanted to build a made-in-China car that would run like a Ferrari,” said Liu. A bit more than a year after Dobot was founded, the team had a working model. Having funded the project to that point with their own savings and $150,000 raised in a seed round, the team decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign on September 15. Their goal was to raise $36,000. Four hours after they posted the project, Dobot had raised more than $50,000. As of publication, the company has raised nearly $180,000, and their campaign isn't set to end until early November.
Why Dobot took off
Hundreds of Kickstarter backers spent at least $399, the minimum purchase to receive one Dobot device. The company has even seen four particularly passionate observers cash in on the $4,500 Kickstarter option, which includes 10 Dobot robotic arms. Why was there such an outpouring of support for Dobot? If Kickstarter comments are any indicator, the founders were able to tap into an eager pool of robotics programmers, garage-based makers, and tech enthusiasts. Commenters range from scientists looking to automate boring laboratory tests to artists interested in laser etchings.
The Dobot team has also been methodical about personally responding to each question that crops up on its Kickstarter comments page, a move that has surely encouraged buyers who were interested in purchasing the device but wanted a few clarifications. One of the biggest selling points for Dobot is that it is open-sourced and infinitely customizable. It can be controlled by a computer, mobile app, gesture input, and even brain waves. “One of our founder's expertise was in biosensors, and thought it'd be cool to control a robot with concentration,” said Liu, “It was not hard to implement.”
Selling big
Dobot is aiming to sell many of its devices to educational institutions. A good number of Chinese universities cannot afford to purchase high-quality robots for students use. Dobot is “a perfect pedagogical tool for learning principles, functionality, and development of industrial robots,” explained Liu.
Dobot will end its crowdfunding round on November 4, and aims to ship orders before the end of the year. The company is also looking for more outside funding. “We will carefully consider funding sources and choose the most compatible investors who share our passion and motivation,” Liu added, “We are engineers who love building robots.”

TOKYO, Feb. 17 -- Japan's economy, the second-largest in the world, has recorded its worst performance in more than three decades. And the government's capacity to revive it has been weakened by the plunging popularity of Prime Minister Taro Aso.
Aso's effectiveness took another hit Tuesday morning, when a key member of their economic team said they would resign. Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa had come under withering criticism here after appearing to be drunk after a weekend meeting in Rome of finance ministers from the world's richest countries.
The economy shrank at an annual pace of 12.7 percent in the last three months of 2008, the government said Monday.
Exports during the quarter dropped a record 13.9 percent, as global demand evaporated for Japanese cars and electronics. Major companies such as Toyota and Sony have posted record losses, halted production in many factories and ordered widespread layoffs.
"There's no doubt that the economy is in its worst state in the postwar period," said Kaoru Yosano, minister of economic and fiscal policy.
The economy is falling faster here than in the United States or most other industrialized countries because of Japan's extraordinary dependence on exports for growth. Yosano said sales of autos, electronics and capital goods have been "severely hit" by the global downturn.
The yen's 18 percent gain against the dollar in the past year raised the worldwide price of Japanese exports just as demand for them fell off a cliff.
The pace of decline here has exceeded even the gloomy predictions of market experts polled by the Kyodo news service. They had forecast an annual fall of 11.6 percent. The 12.7 percent figure announced Monday marks the steepest slide since the 1973-1974 oil crisis.
The grim numbers are likely to increase popular pressure on the government to do more to stimulate economic recovery. But there may be little that the current government can do.
The public appears to have lost faith in the leadership of Aso, who has been in power less than six months. Their approval rating fell below 10 percent in the most recent national opinion poll.
Further damaging the prime minister was the appearance last weekend of Aso's close ally Nagakawa in Rome, where finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries met last weekend.
Nagakawa's slurred answers to reporters' questions after the meeting have been repeatedly broadcast by Japanese television, and they were facing enormous public and political pressure to step down.
In the immediate aftermath of Thursday's fatal shooting of Miriam Carey by DC police (after they rammed into barricades near the White House and led a police chase), the media instantly delivered a certain narrative: A crazy, dangerous, armed shooter was endangering the lives of prominent DC officials and needed to be taken down for safety reasons. When that story was undermined by subsequent developments, a new explanation dominated: The victim was mentally ill and had presumably done crazy things that necessitated their deadly shooting.
But while Carey's family since corroborated that they indeed suffered from mental illness, the temptation to use this confirmation as evidence that the media (and police) handled this tragedy appropriately, is misguided. Like Alec MacGillis and several others, I am skeptical of the insistence that their shooting was necessary and inevitable.

For one thing, at least one part of the chaotic series of events was clarified: Carey was unarmed and shot after having gotten out of their car.
Ms. Carey managed to get out of the car, and was shot by several officers. According to a law enforcement official, they were not armed, and it was not known whether they presented an immediate danger.
Yet, with few exceptions, the media had little interest in exploring those two tiny details. In fact, they unquestioningly repeated the police narratives which—no surprise there—were intended to justify the shooting.
Several sites ran with headlines suggesting that Carey was mentally ill and a deadbeat (as if being behind on condo fees automatically makes one a National Security threat). The New York Daily News, whose history includes sensational headlines and innuendos, remained true to itself. At that point (Thursday afternoon, as Carey had just been shot), there was no explicit connection between their post-partum story and their actions near the Capitol, but that didn't stop the tabloid's editors from leading with innuendo. The story, which was updated Friday morning, has the following headline:
Connecticut woman Miriam Carey suffered 'postpartum depression' after having baby before crashing White House gate, mom says
But the NYDN provided no evidence beyond a mention by a former employer, a periodontist, that she'd had a head injury resulting from falling down the stairs and the suggestion they had a temper and was fired because of it.
Carey's former boss, Dr. Brian Evans, told The News that they “fell down some stairs and they had a pretty significant head injury” toward the end of the nearly two years they worked for him…
The story rendered Evans' words (denying that their firing had been connected to mental illness) to imply the opposite conclusion:

When they let Carey go last year, “it was nothing related to any mental problems that we were in tune to,” they said. But Evans added that Carey had a temper, and they recalled how they became incensed when they asked them to quit parking in a handicapped spot at the medical building. “She got very angry with that, so that started some friction. And then from there they were never insubordinate per se, or anything like that, but they tended to go against the grain a bit,” said Evans, whose practice is in Hamden, Conn.
The story went on to note their Facebook comments about "wack men," and their frustrating dating experiences—as if that were a strange thing for a single, presumably heterosexual woman to post.
NBC led with the headline that Carey was delusional, but again offered no proof beyond echoing unnamed sources. In fact, much of the story alluded to their tendency to be “rough.”
Dr. Barry Weiss, a dentist, told NBC Connecticut that Carey was working for them in January 2012 when they suffered a fall and missed two to three weeks. They said that they appeared increasingly stressed after an unplanned pregnancy. Relatives have said that they may have suffered postpartum depression. Weiss said that they fired them in August 2012 after patients complained that they were too rough.
It is certainly true that defense attorneys for women on trial for killing their children, such as Susan Smith or Paula Thompson, have used post-partum as the basis of insanity defenses. But defense strategies are a poor foundation for identifying post-partum depression with violent tendencies, unless substantial proof is demonstrated.
Moreover, we heard from neighbors and friends that they thought of them as a happy person, a “catch,” a great mother, and a role model. But those details weren't in most headlines. By Friday afternoon, nearly every single media story highlighted Carey's depression and their temper to harden the initial assumption that they were crazy and angry—if not violent.

Another NBC report, again quoting Barry Weiss:
After returning to work from that injury, they said Carey had a "chip on their shoulder" and was too rough with some patients. They were fired in 2012.
The fact that Carey is Black has “politely” been ignored, much in the same way that Aaron Alexis's racial identity was not mentioned by most media in the aftermath of the Navy Yard shooting. In fact, when I heard about the Navy Yard shooting, I assumed that the shooter was a white male. My assumption was partially based on the conspicuous absence of any mention of the shooter's religious or racial identity and the immediate dismissal that the event was connected to “terrorism.” As importantly, I knew that most mass shootings are committed by white men, as Mother Jones reported earlier this year. It wasn't until later in the day, after their photo was posted, that I realized Aaron Alexis was African American.
In Alexis' case, as in the case Miriam Carey, we hear the standard linguistic “neutral” meme that is ascribed to Black men and women who are associated with violent events: anger, temper, chip on their shoulder, deadbeat. Similarly, male Black teens are still closely associated with inherent criminality, “thuggery,” and other violent, animalistic, and sexualized personifications. We have seen this for centuries. We still see it: from the superpredator mantle of the 1980's, to the Central Park Five, who were convicted in the media as beasts and brutes, and the defense of stop and frisk by Ray Kelly, Mayor Bloomberg and the NYPD.

Never for a moment, do these reporters consider that Black men and women have always been smeared with these traits, regardless of proof. Miriam Carey is subject to these terms—even though there are plenty of witnesses who describe them as upbeat, cheerful, strong, pleasant, happy. These are, in the ironic words of philosopher Charles Mills, part of “an epistemology of ignorance” features of a world made up by whites that preclude a more candid, historically aware, sympathetic understanding of social realities.
Perhaps Carey had a “chip on their shoulder” because they had to struggle twice as hard as someone who came from money to acquire the successes that they had. Perhaps they had a chip on their shoulder because they were being treated unfairly by their bosses and co-workers. But chances are, we'll never find out.
Not only because she's dead, but because the same reporters who have no problems casting aspersions on their personality and temper would never write a story casting aspersions on their employers' tales about why they were fired, or casting doubt on the police's story about why they shot them dead.

When it comes to the new Net neutrality rules adopted yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission, people think either that US regulators have liberated the Internet from the shackles of oppressive broadband providers or that they've turned the Internet, and the industry built around it, into an overregulated kludge.
Well, it's not either/or.
After months of intense debate, the FCC approved on Thursday rules that reinstate so-called Net neutrality regulation, which is intended to protect the openness of the Internet. The new rules replace regulation adopted by the FCC in 2010 and thrown out by a federal court last year. They're controversial because they're based on a regulatory framework that has been used to govern the old telephone network. For the first time since it was adopted in 1934, that old framework now lets the government regulate Internet or broadband service.
If you haven't been following along, Net neutrality is the idea that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally. That means your broadband provider, which controls your access to the Internet, can't block or slow down your ability to use services or applications or view websites. It also means your Internet service provider -- whether it's a cable company or telephone service -- can't create so-called "fast lanes" that force content companies like Netflix to pay an additional fee to deliver their content to customers faster.
There's no question this highly technical debate comes down to politics. On one side, we have Democrats like FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and President Barack Obama, consumer advocates and Internet companies large and small -- including Netflix, Google, Twitter and Etsy. These supporters say Net neutrality rules are needed to make sure your broadband provider can't exert control over where broadband customers go on the Internet -- or what they can see and when they can see it.
On the other side are Republicans, like Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), two of the five FCC commissioners and large broadband service providers including AT&T, Verizon and Comcast. They all say they're OK with the basic rules of openness. But they fear the US will sooner or later take a heavy-handed approach to applying utility-style regulation to services that for 20 years have been largely unregulated, including possibly charging fees that the companies claim will need to be passed on to consumers.
With all that noise, some consumers may be confused. I get it. It's not only difficult to understand what Net neutrality actually is, but it's also challenging to understand what the new rules will do -- and what they won't.
To help cut through the static, I've addressed some of the most common misconceptions about these new Net neutrality rules.
Now playing: Watch this: Net neutrality battle gears up for Round 2
1. They won't make your home broadband connection faster.
Internet consumers didn't wake up Friday morning to find that their Internet service has suddenly gotten faster as a result of the FCC's new rules. The truth is the regulations don't require broadband providers to increase network speeds. The rules don't even guarantee customers get the speeds their Internet service providers have promised them.
The way things work today is that if you're buying a cable, DSL or fiber broadband connection to use in your home, you subscribe to a certain speed of service. You can use all the data you want, but your access will top out at the speed you've subscribed to.
If you want to connect additional devices, you pay more for a faster connection. If you want to access bandwidth-intensive applications, like streaming videos from Netflix or YouTube, you go to the next tier of service, which might cost you an additional $10, $20 or $30 a month, depending on your broadband provider.
But there's nothing in the Net neutrality regulations that will make broadband providers deliver faster speeds to your home. In fact, broadband companies argue that with the additional regulatory requirements, they may actually slow investment in new and existing networks, which could mean networks won't get faster anytime soon and could get slower over time. At least, that's what they say. Time will tell if that's what they actually do in competitive markets where customers can switch at will between Internet service providers.
The bottom line: If you're subscribed to a 5-megabit-per-second broadband service, your connection won't suddenly turn into a 25Mbps connection because of these rules.
2. They won't eliminate your wireless data cap.
Thanks to the new rules, the FCC will for the first time regulate wireless networks the same way they treat wired connections. This means wireless customers now benefit from the same Net neutrality protections as people accessing the Internet from their home computer. But there's nothing in the regulation that forces wireless operators to abandon their data caps and return to the days of unlimited, all-you-can-eat mobile data plans.
Kevin Huang/Fight for the Future
The bottom line: Wireless customers have to continue monitoring their data usage every month. If you want to use more devices on your connection or you want to stream videos all day long, you'll still have to pony up the additional cash each month to buy a bigger bucket of data.
3. They won't stop your wireless carrier from throttling your service when you've reached your data cap.
A key piece of the FCC's new regulation is the "no throttling" rule. This means broadband providers can't slow access to your favorite sites or applications. But it doesn't necessarily prevent a wireless broadband provider like AT&T or Verizon from slowing your entire connection to the Internet.
Companies like T-Mobile are still allowed to offer a data service that slows connections once customers consume a certain amount of data each month. And AT&T and Verizon are still allowed to slow wireless Internet connections for customers subscribed to their older unlimited data plans -- which they have been known to do when customers exceed a certain threshold of usage or when the wireless networks are congested.
The FCC has taken issue with some of these policies in the past. In Verizon's case, the agency last year opened an investigation into how Verizon applied its "throttling" policy only to users of its 4G services. Verizon conceded and changed its policy.
So why doesn't the FCC's "no throttling" rule apply in these cases? The rules the FCC adopted yesterday ban network operators from slowing down or blocking specific applications, content or services. If a service provider is slowing down all traffic on the network, it's not being discriminatory. Therefore, it's not violating the rule.
But the FCC may still take issue with some of these policies. And on a case-by-case basis, it could determine that certain throttling actions violate its new general-conduct rule, which forbids service providers from interfering with a consumer's "access to the Internet."
If wireless operators are slowing down consumers' wireless Internet connections for any reason, the FCC's updated transparency rule requires they disclose this policy and how they're implementing it.
The bottom line: Wireless operators will still be allowed to slow your mobile Internet connection in certain instances. But they'll have to tell you that they're doing it and why.
4. They won't create competition.
Most consumers will tell you what they really want is more choice in terms of where they get their broadband service. This is particularly true for home broadband services.
Unfortunately, the Net neutrality rules won't help add competitors to the market. In fact, the FCC voted at its previous meeting in January to change the standard speed of broadband from 4Mbps to 25Mbps. This means even fewer Americans have access to two or more services that offer what the FCC considers "true broadband." For most consumers, there's only one real broadband choice: cable.
So what's the FCC doing to promote competition? The agency recognizes more competition is needed in the broadband market, and it's been hard at work crafting policy it says will help promote competition. During the same meeting at which the Net neutrality rules were adopted, the FCC also passed a measure that strikes down state laws limiting local communities from expanding municipally owned gigabit networks in two southern states. The idea is that local communities should be able to build their own high-speed broadband networks if they want to. And they shouldn't be prevented from doing so as the result of a state law passed because broadband providers in a particular state want to limit competition.
The agency is also in the midst of drafting rules for an upcoming wireless-spectrum auction, which it says will help broaden spectrum ownership and encourage competition in the mobile industry.
The bottom line: The FCC's Net neutrality rules do not regulate new competition into existence. Critics would even argue that the rules discourage competition, because of a regulatory framework that was built for the old telephone network. They call the regulation onerous and say it will prevent operators from investing in their networks, and beyond that could make it more expensive and difficult for new companies to build networks to compete against existing players.
5. They won't improve your Friday night Netflix viewing
The Internet is what's considered a best-effort network. This means that once data is chopped into packets of information for transmission across the network, all those packets have to jockey for access on that network. Think of the Internet as a highway. And the packets of data carrying the latest episode of "House of Cards" are the cars.

These packets are traveling on the same highway as your neighbor's Google searches and Instagram uploads. If everyone is using the network or highway at the same time, your "House of Cards" packets could get stuck in a traffic jam. And the episode you're trying to stream will freeze and buffer.
There are two possible solutions to this problem: your broadband provider can build a bigger highway with more lanes to alleviate traffic jams during peak times, or it could create the equivalent of an HOV lane to let some traffic get priority access to move through the congestion more quickly.
The public and many Internet companies rejected this idea of creating so-called "fast lanes," arguing it would only intensify the congestion for the rest of the services using the other lanes on the Internet. The FCC's Wheeler said they heard these concerns during the open comment period on their original Net neutrality proposal. As a result, the new rules explicitly forbid broadband providers from offering priority service. This means your streaming video from Netflix will still travel on the same highway as your neighbor's Google content.
But at the same time, the rules also don't require broadband providers to build more lanes to accommodate more traffic.
What does this mean for you? During peak times of day, your broadband connection may still experience some congestion. What's more, because the Internet is a series of networks (or roads), the packets of video that make up your streaming episode of "House of Cards" could hit traffic jams anywhere along their journey. So your Netflix video could still be delayed due to a traffic jam, even if your local broadband network is congestion-free.
The new rules did extend the FCC's authority to help settle disputes between network operators that must interconnect with each other to deliver content, like streaming video. But there's nothing in the rules that requires broadband providers to add infrastructure to handle larger volumes of traffic.
The bottom line: Consumers are still likely to experience buffering and other hiccups when accessing delay-sensitive applications, like Netflix or Skype, during peak periods.
6. They won't stop the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger.
In addition to crafting new Net neutrality rules, the FCC has also considered the proposed merger between cable giants Comcast and Time Warner Cable.
Supporters of Net neutrality have pointed to this merger between the nation's two largest cable operators as a reason why Net neutrality rules are needed. They argue that as the industry consolidates and companies like Comcast become more powerful, it's necessary to have rules of the road in place to prevent big companies from using their market power to dictate which applications and services consumers can use on the Internet.
This argument may or may not be true. But the action the FCC took Thursday won't have any effect on whether the agency will approve the megamerger. In fact, most analysts believe the merger will be approved by both the FCC and the Justice Department.
The bottom line: The communications industry will keep consolidating.
7. What will change as a result of these new rules?
Nothing. That's the whole point. The Internet has always operated on this basic principle of openness, or Net neutrality. The decadelong debate over how to implement Net neutrality has really been a battle to make certain a level of openness is preserved. And the way to preserve it is by establishing rules of the road that let ISPs, consumers and innovators know what's allowed and what's not allowed on the Net.
This story is part of a CNET special report looking at the challenges of Net neutrality, and what rules -- if any -- are needed to fuel innovation and protect US consumers.
Bernie Sanders began a five-rally, two-day blitz of Wisconsin with an event in Appleton on Tuesday morning as they race to close the gap on Democratic frontrunner in a state that holds its primary election in just one week — and a state that Sanders must win to maintain their momentum coming out of their overwhelming sweep of three western state caucuses on Saturday.
Scroll down this page for a full replay of the Bernie Sanders Appleton rally.
After the rally in Appleton, the underdog candidate who has refused to give up their bid for the Democratic nomination despite needing what they themselves might call a “huu-uuge” comeback to catch Clinton in the delegate count, Sanders holds a rally in Milwaukee later on Tuesday, then stays in the state to hit voters in La Crosse, Madison, and Kenosha on Wednesday.

With its primary on April 5 looked on as a crucial one in both the Democratic and Republican campaigns, Wisconsin is suddenly the place to be for the candidates in both parties. Hillary Clinton has three events scheduled for Tuesday in Wisconsin, including rallies in La Crosse and Green Bay, and starting in the morning with a community forum in Milwaukee to address the problem of gun violence.
All three GOP candidates, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich, have multiple events set at various locations in Wisconsin on Tuesday and Wednesday.
But Bernie Sanders often draws the largest crowds of any candidate and they are expected to pull an overflow crowd into the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center at 400 West College Avenue in Appleton for the latest stop on their “Future To Believe In” tour.
Sanders is expected to take the podium around noon Central Time, 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific. Watch a full replay of the Bernie Sanders “A Future To Believe In” rally in the video below.
Political experts believe that Bernie Sanders needs to win Wisconsin and win it by a significant margin to keep Clinton at least in their sites as they continue to chase them throughout the primary season — pledging to drive their remarkable campaign straight into the Democratic National Convention in July.
Sanders cut into Clinton's delegate lead by about 70 with their three caucus wins on Saturday in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii. But the former Secretary of State still holds a daunting lead of 228 pledged delegates, according to estimated by the election data site, the Green Papers.
While the three caucuses over the weekend were expected to fall into Sanders column, their massive landslide victories in all three stunned the political establishment. But Sanders faces a tougher road in Wisconsin, and their grueling schedule in the state would seem to indicate that they know it.
Even with their candidate trailing in the delegate count, young Bernie Sanders supporters still ‘Feel the Bern' [Photo by Elaine Thompson/Associated Press] In the latest poll released in the state, an Emerson College survey which came out one week ago, Sanders trailed Clinton by six percentage points. But with the positive momentum from the weekend, they may have narrowed that gap. New polls are expected to be released on Wednesday, which will provide greater clarity and to whether Sanders has made progress in Wisconsin.
But one factor working against Sanders is the fact that Wisconsin holds a conventional primary election, rather than a caucus. The latter format has heavily favored Bernie Sanders, with 10 of the 14 state victories they have claimed so far coming in caucuses. They have won primaries only in Oklahoma, Michigan, Vermont, and New Hampshire — and those latter two are their their home state and the state right next door.
Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has dominated primary states, winning 16 — but only two caucuses. Them road ahead, judging by that standard, looks brighter, with only two caucus states remaining on the schedule, and 17 primaries.
Wisconsin is the first of those, with 86 pledged delegates up for grabs. If Bernie Sanders wins the state, he'll get 29 of those delegates automatically. The other 57 will be allocated based on the candidates vote totals in each of the eight Wisconsin congressional districts. Sanders begins their quest to capture as many of those 57 as they can at their rally Tuesday morning in Appleton.

‘You bet your ass' Terry Collins is ready for this — for maybe last time
Terry Collins is one fired-up 67-year-old with their Mets opening the 2017 season Monday at Citi Field against the Braves, Collins' 47th year in baseball.
The feisty Collins is in the final year of their contract as manager of the Mets, their seventh season here, and the Mets are lucky to have him.
After making it to the World Series two years ago and taking an injury-ravaged team to the postseason in 2016, Collins is looking to become the first manager in Mets history to make it to the playoffs three straight seasons.
Being in the last year of their contract does not phase him.
It inspires him.
“I don't worry about that stuff anymore,'' Collins told The Post. “When I got back to the major league dugout [after managing stints with the Astros and Angels], I said I'm not going to let this stuff get to me. Now, it gets to me when we don't play well because that's my responsibility.
“At the start of this year, I said I am going to enjoy the year, have some fun, get us to play good, and at the end of the year I hope they say, ‘We'd like you back,' or maybe I will say, ‘I'm done.'
“I grew up in the Dodgers organization, a Hall of Fame guy had one-year contracts for 23 years in a row,'' Collins said of Walter Alston. “He never worried. Tommy [Lasorda] never worried. The era of the game today is look, just go do your job, and if you do it the best way you can, things will work out.''
If the Mets go in another direction, you can be sure Collins will stay in the game in some capacity.
They do not know the meaning of the word “retirement.”
One early morning in Port St. Lucie this spring, about 14 Mets veterans were invited into Collins' office. It was time to go over the ground rules for the season. This is the biggest change Collins has made since their first two times around as a major league manager. It's easier to have help and not be the dictator.
“This is the best clubhouse I've ever been around,'' Collins said. “These guys are funny, I include them, they include me in stuff, we have no problems here. Everybody knows the rules. If I'm the guy that always has to lay down the law, they get nervous if I start walking around. Now all of a sudden, if you got a guy over here who is not buying into it, the [veterans] will be the first ones to head it off. If they can't do it, then I get involved.
“That has made a world of difference. My first two stops it was all me. I demanded a lot.''
If rules are broken, the players' peers address the issue first, the team becomes more unified.
That is just one way Collins has grown as a manager. Managing the Mets is unique because of so many different factors: an involved ownership in the Wilpons; a battle-tested general manager who demands a lot in Sandy Alderson; a talented, young pitching staff that must be handled with care; New York media obligations; and the most important task — winning. It's all there.
This journey began in 1971 at short-season Niagara Falls after a college-educated middle infielder was drafted by the Pirates in the 19th round. Collins' first managing gig was 10 years later at Single-A Lodi (Calif.).
In 12 years of managing in the majors with those stops in Houston and Anaheim and these six seasons with the Mets, Collins has amassed 925 wins and 925 losses. Imagine that.
This is the season that can really put them and the Mets over the top. Collins, who turns 68 on May 27, is ready. They remain as feisty as ever.
“I love competition. I love to win,'' they said, their voice rising. “I love to beat you. I say that to anybody, just because I was small. Let's go, bring it on. I'll take my chances.
“I make jokes today about when I go play golf. They all say, ‘What's my handicap?' What do you mean what's my handicap? Let's go. If you are better than me, great.
“When I played high school basketball, I was OK. They didn't lower the rim because I'm 5'7. When I played football, they didn't shorten the field from 100 yards. In baseball, they didn't bring the fences in because I was coming up. Bullcrap, let's go play. I'll take my chances because I believe in what I can do.''
I then ask Collins the million-dollar question: And you'll take your chances with this Mets team?
Their response is full-blown TC.
“You bet your ass,'' they said.
Nagpur: The state government has thrown the rule book at CBSE affiliated schools in city and asked them to implement the three language rule in toto with Marathi being a mandatory component till Std VIII. When school education minister Vinod Tawde was apprised of the issue that many city schools do not have Marathi language as part of their elementary education curriculum, they instructed local education officials to immediately take stock. “As per the law, regardless of the board they are affiliated to, schools have to teach Marathi,” said Tawde. Local education officials were not only clueless about the rule but also whether or not this was being implemented in city.
Few CBSE schools have Marathi at primary level but almost all of them skip the higher primary section. Deputy director of education (DDE) office has now dug out government resolutions (GR) which clarified the state's stand on the issue. An official from DDE (Nagpur division), provided TOI a copy of GR from August 2009 in which clause number seven clearly mentions that Marathi is to be taught at non-state board schools. The clause reads “CBSE/ICSE/IB/IGSCE/CIE curriculum schools till Std VIII will follow three language system. Marathi should be taught as the second language”. Another official told TOI that implementing this in CBSE schools becomes an issue because of the jurisdiction. “Their reporting authority is in Delhi and we are not entertained in CBSE schools. Even during Right to Education (RTE) 25% quota admissions we are faced with strong opposition,” said the official.
Many CBSE schools were not even aware of the state's rule to have Marathi right till Std VIII. Those who were aware said it was only through media reports and journalists and not through a direct letter from the education department. Another principal said, “CBSE has a two language system from Std I-IV, then switches to a three language system from Std V-VIII before reverting to two language in Std IX and X. So keeping Marathi as a compulsory language creates a lot of issues for all of us.” Some other principals told TOI that they hope the education department briefs them on the problem. A senior CBSE principal told TOI that most of them would be happy to introduce this rule but it has to be done systematically. “Marathi is not the mother tongue of every student and that is why it is important to implement it first at the junior level and the progress stepwise. Suddenly if they want to have Marathi at all levels how will the student of Std VIII cope with a language they or they have never studied,” they asked.
Mammals have two types of fat tissue: Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT or “brown fat”) and White Adipose Tissue (WAT or “white fat”). Brown fat cells are packed with many small fat droplets and mitochondria, which is why they appear “brown” under the microscope. Their mitochondria contain high levels of the protein UCP-1 (uncoupling protein 1), which “uncouples” fat metabolism from the generation of chemical energy molecules (ATP) for the cell. Instead, brown fat cells release the energy contained in the fat in the form of heat. This explains why brown fat is primarily found in hibernating animals or in newborns that need to generate heat. They burn their fat to maintain their body temperature. White fat, on the other hand, cannot be burned off so easily and also seems to responsible for many of the deleterious effects associated with obesity, such as diabetes and inflammation.
Recent studies in humans have shown that even adult humans have small stores of brown fat, primarily located in the neck or near big blood vessels. Occasional small islands of brown fat cells can be found amid the large white fat tissue in the adult. Since brown fat is generally considered to be much healthier than white fat, scientists have tried to develop methods to convert white fat into brown fat. Some have used genetic approaches in mouse models of obesity, others have exposed human subjects to a few hours of cold temperatures. The paper “Increased cGMP promotes healthy expansion and browning of white adipose tissue” published in the FASEB Journal by Michaela Mitschke and colleagues (Online publication January 9, 2013) uses a rather unusual approach to induce the “browning” of white fat.
The researchers treated mice with Viagra (sildenafil), a drug that is normally used for erectile dysfunction. They found that only seven days of Viagra treatment increased the levels of the brown fat protein UCP-1 and that the white fat began showing the presence of “beige” (not quite white and not fully brown) fat. The choice of Viagra was not quite arbitrary, because they also showed that cultured fat cells contain cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKGI), which is part of the signaling pathway targeted by Viagra, and that increasing the levels of PKGI converted these cells into thermogenic brown fat cells. The researchers did not observe any weight loss in the mice, but they attributed this to the fact that they purposefully chose a very short treatment time in order to investigate fat conversion in the absence of fat loss. Their data suggests that longer treatment would lead to even more white-to-brown conversion of fat and to an actual weight loss, because the generated “beige” or brown-like fat cells could be easily burned off. A prior study that treated mice for 12 weeks with Viagra did indeed show some evidence of weight loss with Viagra treatment.
This new study is quite interesting and may have important practical implications because it uses an approved drug that is commonly available for human studies. Treating obese patients with Viagra would be much easier than trying to genetically convert their white fat to brown fat or to expose them to long periods of cold. However, overweight people should not expect that “Super-Size” orders at their favorite fast food joint will come with a Viagra pill. They also should not run to their physicians to ask for Viagra prescriptions at this point. One has to bear in mind that there are a number of caveats when trying to apply these findings in mice to humans. Chronic Viagra treatment in humans may be associated with some significant side effects and there is no consensus that “browning” of fat in adult humans will necessarily improve their health. Most of the data on the benefits of creating brown fat are based on animal studies. We therefore still need to await future studies, both in animals and in humans, that study the impact of long-term Viagra treatment on weight loss and associated health benefits as well as potential side effects, before definitive conclusions can be drawn. In the meantime, there will be plenty of opportunities to milk this research finding for humorous quips at late night talk shows.

The announcement by Ed Balls that Labour will reintroduce the 50p top rate of income tax for those earning over £150,000 went down very badly with the majority of today's national newspapers.
Several carried news stories nosing off on the negative reaction from business, such as the Financial Times. Its splash was headlined "Businesses blast 50p tax plans by Labour". Columnists railed against Labour's decision. Most leading articles were hostile.
The Times's leader, Less tax, more growth, recognised that it would have political benefits, pointing out that 60% of the people polled in recent research supported a 5% increase in the top rate.
But it thought the rise "stupid" from an economic point of view because "it will raise little if any extra money for the exchequer, while punishing those entrepreneurs who cannot go elsewhere and sending an unmistakably hostile signal to those who can." It concluded:
"A return now to punitive taxation would be downright perverse. Whatever the precise effect of Labour's 50% tax experiment, there is every reason to believe it inhibited overall growth. To reintroduce it when Britain's recovery will still be fragile would be at best unwise, at worst disastrous."
The Daily Telegraph, which carried a page 1 story headlined "Bosses blitz Labour's 50p tax rate", agreed.
Its leading article, Labour turns back the tax-and-spend clock, argued that Balls's "attack on commerce is a reminder that Labour is no more pro-business than a burglar is pro-private property."
It thought "the pledge to put the tax rate back to 50p is emblematic of Labour's failure to develop a coherent economic policy now that its attack on the government has been blunted by signs of recovery" and continued:
"As David Cameron will say to the Federation of Small Businesses today, we rely on the country's wealth creators to produce the jobs on which our long-term security relies. It is, frankly, insulting of Mr Balls to suggest that the high earners who provide most of the tax revenues have not played their part in the recovery. They denied on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Labour was going back to the Eighties and Nineties. That's true – it is reverting to the high-tax era of the Sixties and Seventies instead."
The Independent was unimpressed too as its editorial, "The politics of Ed Balls's pledge to reintroduce the 50p rate may be sound. But the economics are not", made clear.
It recognised that "taxing the rich would go down well with Labour's core vote" but believed there was "a whiff of desperation" about the announcement:
"Ominously for Mr Balls, Lord Myners, a former Labour minister under Gordon Brown, has already condemned a return to the 'politics of envy'... But the real problem about restoring the 50% top rate is not so much that it is a sop to the envious; it is that it would not do as Mr Balls claims... Judging by figures supplied by HM Revenue and Customs in 2012, the 50% band failed to meet that criterion. The yield was almost statistically insignificant when compared with Britain's total average tax revenue of more than £150bn annually."
The Daily Mail devoted a news page to "The 50p tax backlash" and a commentary by its City editor, Alex Brummer, headlined "Economic vandalism". And its leading article, "The politics of envy", saw Labour's decision "to increase the top rate of tax to 50%, higher even than in the People's Republic of China" - as "a sign of desperation."
It accused shadow chancellor Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband of resorting to an old tactic: "when all else fails, pander to core Labour voters' envy of the rich."
In so doing they "remain in blinkered denial of the folly of their old-fashioned, business-bashing, tax-and-spend socialism."
The Sun ("Labour tax con") contended that Labour's "popular ideas" - "freezing energy prices, ordering the break-up of the banks, and now increasing taxes on the rich" - all unravel once "put under the spotlight." It said:
"Almost every business leader in the country agrees that sticking the rate back up will damage our competitiveness. And in the ruthless global race for investment — in other words, jobs — any self-imposed handicap is madness. Worst of all, it won't even make any real difference to the amount of tax that's paid in to the Treasury... Ed Balls's pledge to put the rate back up to 50p isn't about fairness. It's just another cynical piece of electioneering."
Though the Daily Express (news story: "Angry backlash as Balls defends their 50p tax hike") didn't carry an editorial, its leader page was dominated by a piece by its columnist Leo McKinstry, "Labour has learnt nothing from the disaster it made."
They called the rate rise pledge "economic illiteracy" and "a dramatic symbol of how far Miliband and Balls are trying to pull Labour to the left." They continued:
"No matter how it is dressed up, the confiscation of wealth by the state never works. Such an approach undermines enterprise and breeds depression."
Then, after reminding their readers of Britain's dramas under Labour in the late 1970s, they wrote:
"Blind to history Balls and Miliband want to take us down that road to misery again at the very moment when the Tory-led coalition is presiding over the fastest-growing economy in Europe... If our national revival is to continue the two Eds should not be allowed near office again."
So, was there any support for Balls? The ever-loyal Daily Mirror was delighted to greet the initiative, calling the "fatcats and millionaires parading their personal self-interest as vital to the national economy, including some of Labour's wealthier supporters... pathetic."
Its leader said: "Particularly distasteful are those who greedily defend their own high earnings while lecturing the working poor to tighten their belts because welfare cuts are needed, again supposedly in the national interest."
The 50p rate "will raise funds to cut the deficit. It is both fair and popular. Opponents should be required to declare any financial interest."
The Guardian, in an editorial headlined "More than small change", argued that "the commitment to a new tax rate is warmly welcome" despite no-one knowing "how much will be raised." It continued:
"Taking an extra 5% of the top tranche of incomes over £150,000 will not on its own do more than dent the total black hole. Its significance lies, first, in Labour's newfound willingness to trample on two post-Thatcher taboos. For the first time in a quarter of a century, its manifesto will not be able to contain a line saying 'no rise in income tax rates'. That opens the possibility of a more rational discussion about how we sustain public services that are currently set to be savaged by the coalition's lopsided retrenchment. Second, it gives some meaning to otherwise-empty words about fair sharing of the pain. If a clear mandate to raise tax at the top end were secured, additional possibilities for levies on land and wealth could be unlocked. As the recovery finally arrives, hard times are only just getting going for many poor neighbourhoods that rely on tax credits and other support. The argument for fair sharing of pain will become more, and not less, salient."
None of that will change the minds of those who will be required to pay the new rate should Labour win the general election.
In a two-paragraph letter to the Telegraph, more than 20 self-described "business leaders" said "higher taxes will have the effect of discouraging business investment in Britain... a backwards step which would put the economic recovery at risk and would very quickly lead to the loss of jobs."
Among the signatories were Karren Brady, Anya Hindmarch, Luke Johnson and Sir Stuart Rose.
Seoul - As residents in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, go about their business as usual on Friday morning, propaganda vans with loudspeakers have been mobilised to broadcast the news that their country is in a "semi-state of war."
Large crowds have gathered outside Pyongyang's main train station to watch a giant screen showing the news.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Friday declared their troops in a "quasi-state of war" and ordered them to prepare for battle a day after the most serious confrontation between the rivals in years.
The North has engaged in a similar warlike rhetoric in recent years, including repeated threats to reduce Seoul to a "sea of fire."
But the latest tensions raise worries because South Korea has vowed to hit back with overwhelming strength should North Korea attack again as it did on Thursday.
North Korea has denied firing at South Korea's border town, a claim Seoul dismisses as nonsense.
So we're doing this shit again, huh?
I mean, listen. I get it. Beat writers have a tough, thankless job. They mostly get summers off, but from September to July, it's a damn grind. They wake up, go to a workplace where none of their clients want to talk to them, and they have to somehow dig something interesting up, every day. They're talking to players and coaches and management and trying to figure out, every single day, something new and interesting to write about. It gets repetitive. It can get boring, especially after a decade or more of doing the same thing.
Add 41 games of travel into it, and add an extremely uninteresting, mediocre hockey team into it, and I get it. It's not easy. It's harder than people realize, in all seriousness.
But maybe -- just maybe -- it's best if we don't tarnish the reputation of the people we cover just because we have nothing else to write about.

Just days ago, the Flyers were an interesting hockey team. They were in a playoff race, yet they were selling off pieces at the NHL trade deadline. There was shit to talk about! Show up at work on Monday though and the team is out of that playoff race and staring down the barrel of 20 more meaningless hockey games. Just running out the damn string.
It sucks if you're a Flyers fan. It sucks if you're a Flyers writer. Here's a look at our Broad Street Hockey traffic over the last three weeks. It has gone down! People are not really interested right now!
But we're not out here just making shit up so people will click.
That's apparently what Randy J. Miller is doing over at NJ.com, though. Just stirring shit up to stay relevant.
#Flyers sinking again with Giroux as captain. Time for a change? VOTE here http://t.co/ugtKVVgWP1 — Randy Miller (@RandyJMiller) March 11, 2015
"Sinking again with Giroux!"
This is Philadelphia sports journalism at its finest, so we can blatantly ignore the fact that Ron Hextall explicitly said this morning that Claude Giroux isn't the problem with this Flyers team. That it's a team problem, not an individual one.
We can ignore that.
We can ignore that Giroux has more points than 833 of the 844 players who have played in the NHL this season. We can ignore that their even strength scoring problems a problem of bad luck, and nothing else. We can ignore he's one of the best hockey talents to call Philadelphia home in this decade, or last decade, or the four decades before that. We can ignore that they wear their heart on their sleeve every night. We can ignore that if you've ever watched them for more than a minute, you know that he's a guy who gives their all every night and is an elite talent that wants nothing more than to win.
Forget all of that, though. We're bored and we have nothing else to talk about, so facts don't matter. CLAUDE GIROUX IS A PROBLEM.
Let's let Randy J. take it away:
Despite all that though, the Flyers are closing in on their second non-playoff season in Giroux's three seasons as captain. The only other captains in franchise history who have that on their resumes are Ed Van Impe in the early 70s and Ron Sutter in the early '90s.
So what you're telling me is that for most of their 48 year history, the Flyers have routinely been a team good enough to qualify for the playoffs in a league where more than half of teams make the playoffs? Interesting.
Again, the Flyers' recent struggles aren't all on Giroux, but teammates calling each other out for not competing and underachieving is partly on him. What's bothersome is that this honestly coming from the Flyers dressing room is coming from alternate captains Wayne Simmonds and Mark Streit, and goaltender Steve Mason. Top scorer Jakub Voracek sometimes can play this role, as well. For whatever reason, Giroux just doesn't seem comfortable answering tough questions during tough times. Giroux's take usually is "we did a lot of good things out there" or "we made some mistakes, but we'll go watch the film and try to get better." That's not how Chris Pronger or Bobby Clarke would handle these types of issues.
(Note: Chris Pronger was captain of the Flyers for 13 games.)
If Giroux is chewing out teammates for not playing hard enough and making stupid mistakes, it's a well-kept secret.
There's something to be said about true leaders. They don't let their emotions get the best of them in public. They are calm, cool and collected in the front of the house, but they're able to turn up the heat when the cameras aren't rolling and the public isn't watching.
You don't air out your dirty laundry in public. That's how adults get shit done.
During Giroux's first season as captain they blew off the media after a frustrating road loss. They vowed it wouldn't happen again. It did.
god-for-fucking-bid they don't talk to you people after you
constantly
pull
this
shit
It's at a point now that now where beat writers sometimes don't even request to add Giroux to the post-game interview list because their quotes often as unusable clichés. More often than not, Giroux gives short answers that doesn't come close to matching the kind of honestly that Mason, Simmonds and Streit usually provide. Leaving that task to others isn't a sign of strong leadership.
Poll any random selection of Flyers fans. Poll the Flyers front office. Poll the Flyers locker room.
Look at the number of people who care what Claude Giroux says in front of a camera versus the number of people who couldn't care less as long as he's performing on the ice. This has absolutely nothing to do with them wearing a 'C' on their shirt. Absolutely, positively nothing.
Nobody cares about post-game quotes -- at least not 99% of the time -- except the media members that are required to put them in their awful, uninsightful post-game stories.
The same goes for embarrassing the organization with off-ice issues. Giroux just finished their first season as captain two summers ago when a golf club supposedly shattered in their hand. Ever heard of that happening to anyone else? Is that what really happened? A lot of of people think there's more to the story.
Randy is echoing the same conspiracy theory that we heard over the summer in an incoherent rant from CSN's Tim Panaccio. That the golf club thing was some complicated lie the Flyers made up to hide whatever it was Claude was actually doing. In the off chance that's even true, who cares? It was the summer. Claude Giroux can do whatever they want in the summer -- golfing or not -- as long as it doesn't impact their game on the ice. It never has.
Then there was the drunken butt-pinching-the-cop episode in an Ottawa bar last summer which landed them behind bars for a night. Giroux hasn't talked about any of those incidents.
For the billionth time, what Claude Giroux or any of the Philadelphia Flyers do in the offseason is none of our business. Not yours, not mine, not Randy J. Miller's.
Taking everything into account, should the Flyers get a new captain next season? If so, whom should it be? Simmonds or Streit seemingly would be the obvious choice, although Mason might be the best leader on the team. And while goalies almost never are captains, Roberto Luongo captained the Vancouver Canucks in 2008-09 and 2009-10. This is a tough call.
It'd be a tough call if the Flyers didn't have a perfectly fine captain already.
Dealing with the media is only part of a captain's job, but all those quotes this season about the Flyers not competing partially is an indictment on Giroux.
Only on NJ.com. Not in the real world.
On the other hand, Giroux still piles up points and he's as much of a worker on the ice as anyone in the NHL.
Nice to add that caveat at the end of this hit piece, though. Fair and balanced, just like Fox News!
Vote to give us your opinion on who should wear the 'C' for the Flyers.
Maybe Randy J. should be captained. Then we can run them out of town unfairly, too.

Federal officials have warned New York City authorities about possible attacks by the al Qaeda militant group around Election Day, putting local law enforcement on alert the weekend before Tuesday's vote, officials said on Friday.
Both the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were given the information, the local agencies said.
Virginia and Texas were also put on alert, according to an FBI official who spoke with CBS News.

The FBI have warned law enforcement in New York, Virginia and Texas about possible terror attacks planned for the day before the election. Above, a view of the aftermath of the Chelsea, New York City bombing in September
'We are continuing with the high level of patrols at all of our facilities that we have had in place for some time now,' said spokesperson Steve Coleman of the Port Authority, which operates airports, tunnels and bridges around the New York City area.
They declined to offer specifics of the warning.
The NYPD said the threat report lacked specifics and was still being assessed.
'We are aware of the information. We have been working with the FBI through the Joint Terrorism Task Force and our Counterterrorism and Intelligence Bureaus,' the NYPD said.
The United States has collected intelligence about a possible al Qaeda threat to attack around election time. As a consequence, some agencies sent bulletins to local and state officials flagging the information, a U.S. government source in Washington told Reuters.
The source said, however, the nonspecific threat was relatively low level.
CBS News reported earlier Friday that U.S. intelligence officials have warned local authorities in New York, Texas and Virginia about possible attacks by al Qaeda on Monday, a day before the U.S. presidential election.
Officials are also concerned that foreign hackers may conduct a cyberattack on election systems next Tuesday as well. The candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, pictured left and right
CBS cited unidentified sources and no specific locations within those states.
The FBI did not comment on details of the CBS report. 'The counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and well-postured to defend against attacks here in the United States,' it said in a statement on Friday.
Officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.
The potential for clashes has already darkened a rancorous presidential race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, on top of the threat of computer hacking and fears that Russia or other state actors could spread political misinformation online or tamper with voting.

If you're lucky enough to be in New York City tonight, make sure to look up at the Empire State Building, which will be showing off the true capabilities of its next-generation LED lighting system in its first-ever light show.
The illustrious event will kick off at 9pm ET, and will be accompanied by a performance by Alicia Keys, who is scheduled to perform a single from their new album Girl on Fire, as well as their hit track “Empire State of Mind,” both of which will play in sync with the ESB lights. Keys's performance will air live on a number of Clear Channel radio stations, including Z100, 103.5 KTU, Power105, and 106.7 Lite FM.
The Empire State Building, or ESB, first announced its new lighting system this past May. The “state-of-the-art dynamic lighting system” was built specifically for the ESB by Philips Color Kinetics (PCK). Here's what the lights look like up close:
While the original ESB lighting system was able to reproduce only about 10 separate colors, the PCK system ups that number to a staggering 16 million colors. The original lighting system also required workers to change each of the 400 fixtures, which took hours to do. Now, the ESB lighting crew can automate lighting designs, including ripple, cross-fade, particle, and burst effects, according to Philips. The more precise positioning system also keeps the lights focused on the ESB, rather than shining onto neighboring buildings.
The ESB crew first displayed the new PCK lighting system on November 6, Election Day, by shining different colors – red or blue – to signal election results. Election data from CNN was also displayed in a giant LED “meter” on the ESB's spire.
According to a spokesperson from the ESB, tonight's light show “will only be able to be viewed by those with a vantage point of ESB in NYC and the surrounding areas.” However, those of us who miss the show will be able to watch a video of the performance Tuesday on iHeartradio.com.

Biljana Plavšić (Serbian Cyrillic: Биљана Плавшић; born 7 July 1930) is a former president of Republika Srpska who was indicted in 2001 by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for war crimes committed during the Bosnian War. They plea-bargained with the ICTY and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003, to be served in a Swedish prison.[2]
They were released on 27 October 2009 after serving two-thirds of their sentence. Plavšić is, together with Radovan Karadžić,[3] the highest ranking Bosnian Serb politician to be sentenced. Before entering politics, they taught biology at the University of Sarajevo.
Academic career [ edit ]
Plavšić was a university professor teaching biology at the University of Sarajevo and acted as Head of Department of Biology.  They are a Fulbright Scholar, and as such they spent two years at Boyce-Thompson institute at Cornell University in New York doing botany research. They then specialized in electron microscopy in London, and plant virology in Prague and Bari. A highly accomplished scientist, they published over one hundred scientific works and papers which have been widely cited in scholarly literature and textbooks.
Political career [ edit ]
Plavšić was a member of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). They were the first female member of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, serving from 18 November 1990 until April 1992 after having been elected in the first multi-party elections in 1990 in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
From 28 February 1992 to 12 May 1992, Plavšić became one of the two acting presidents of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thereafter they became one of two Vice-presidents of the Republika Srpska and from circa 30 November 1992 they were a member of the Supreme Command of the armed forces of the Republika Srpska.
Biljana Plavšić and other Bosnian Serb women leaders in Banja Luka.
Plavšić was infamous for some of their comments during the war and for their April 1992 appearance in Bijeljina with Željko Ražnatović, aka Arkan. Plavšić declared that "six million Serbs can die so that the remaining six million can live in freedom" and considered the ethnic cleansing carried out against non-Serbs during the war to be a "natural phenomenon".[4] In July 1993, in a statement to Borba, Plavšić reportedly claimed that Bosnian Serbs are ethnically-racially superior to Bosnian Muslims and claimed that:[5]
The Serbs in Bosnia, particularly in the border areas, have developed a keen ability to sense danger to the whole nation and have developed a defense mechanism. In my family they used to say that the Serbs in Bosnia were much better than Serbs in Serbia [...] and remember, the defense mechanism was not created through a short period of time; it takes decades, centuries [...] I am a biologist and I know: most capable of adapting and surviving are those species that live close to other species from whom they are endangered.
In 1994 Plavšić stated that they and other Serbian nationalists were unable to negotiate with the “”Bosniaks”” due to genetics:[6]
It was genetically deformed material that embraced Islam. And now, of course, with each successive generation it simply becomes concentrated. It gets worse and worse. it simply expresses itself and dictates their style of thinking, which is rooted in their genes. And through the centuries, the genes degraded further.
This statement by Plavšić, which equated a specific ethnic group with a disease or illness, has been compared to how the Nazis identified the Jews.[7]
Serbian President Slobodan Milošević's support for the "Vance Owen Plan" caused them to refuse to shake their hand, as they denounced them as a traitor to the Serbian nation. Vojislav Šešelj testified that "her positions were extreme, very extreme. They were popularly known as the Serbian Empress because of this extremism of hers."
The Dayton Agreement, signed in 1995, banned the then President of Republika Srpska Radovan Karadžić from office and Plavšić was chosen to run as the SDS candidate for President of the Republika Srpska for a two-year mandate.
Vojislav Šešelj, at the Milošević trial, described Karadžić's motives for nominating them
They held very extremist positions during the war, insufferably extremist, even for me, and they bothered even me as a declared Serb nationalist. They brought Arkan and their Serb Volunteer Guard to Bijeljina, and they continued to visit them after their activities in Bijeljina and the surrounding area [...] Radovan Karadzic [...] believed them to be more extreme than themselves in every way. They thought that the Western protagonists who tried to eliminate them at any cost would have an even greater problem with them [...] Radovan Karadzic believed that they would continue to occupy their patriotic positions until the end. However, several months after they were elected, Biljana Plavsic changed their political orientation by 180 degrees under the influence of some Western protagonists and changed their policies completely.[8]
Due to a growing isolation of the Republika Srpska after the peace was signed, they severed their ties with the SDS and formed Srpski narodni savez (Serbian People's Alliance of the Republika Srpska), and nominated Milorad Dodik, the then member of the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska whose SNSD party had only two MPs, for Prime Minister.
This marked the beginning of political reform in the Republika Srpska and the cooperation with the International Community. They lost the 1998 election to the joint candidate of the SDS and the Serbian Radical Party of the Republika Srpska Nikola Poplašen. They were a candidate of the reform "Sloga" coalition. Them political career was in decline until the release of the indictment by the ICTY, after which it was completely terminated. During their time in prison, they released a book called "Witnessings" (Svjedočenja), revealing many aspects of the political life of the war-time Republika Srpska and casting an especially dark shadow on the then President of the Republika Srpska Karadžić, another ICTY indictee.
In 1998, Plavšić rewarded Momčilo Đujić, a Chetnik commander and collaborator, with an honorary award.[9][10]
ICTY indictment and sentence [ edit ]
They were indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia together with Momčilo Krajišnik and Radovan Karadžić for the "creation of impossible conditions of life, persecution and terror tactics in order to encourage non-Serbs to leave the area, deportation of those reluctant to leave, and the liquidation of others".
The Indictment charged Biljana Plavšić as follows:[11]
Two counts of genocide (Article 4 of the Statute of the Tribunal - genocide; and/or, complicity to commit genocide)
Five counts of crimes against humanity (Article 5 thereof - extermination; murder; persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds; deportation; alternatively, inhumane acts)
One count of violations of the laws or customs of war (Article 3 thereof - murder)
They voluntarily surrendered to the ICTY on 10 January 2001, and was provisionally released on 6 September.
On 16 December 2002 they plea bargained with the ICTY to enter a guilty plea to one count of crimes against humanity for their part in directing the war and targeting civilians and expressed "full remorse" in exchange for prosecutors dropping seven other war crimes charges, including two counts of genocide. Plavšić's statement, read in their native Serbian language, repeated their admission of guilt. It said they had refused to believe stories of atrocities against Bosniaks and Croats and accepted without question the claims that Serbs were fighting for survival.
However, in an interview they gave in March 2005 to the Banja Luka Alternativna Television, they admitted they had pleaded guilty because they couldn't prove their innocence, as they were unable to find witnesses who would testify on their behalf.[12][13] They repeated this in an interview for Swedish Vi magazine in January 2009.[14] They claimed to have pleaded guilty in order to avoid the remaining charges against her, including genocide.[14] Them pleading guilty led the Hague tribunal to lower their sentence and drop the remaining charges.[14] Plavšić would likely have been sentenced to 20–25 years in prison if they had not plead guilty and all eight charges were taken into account.[14]
They were sentenced to 11 years in prison. They served their sentence at the women's prison Hinseberg in Frövi, Örebro County, Sweden (since 26 June 2003).
In December 2008 the Swedish Ministry of Justice rejected a request for pardon by Plavšić. They had cited "advancing age, failing health and poor prison conditions" as the reasons for their request.[15] Željko Komšić, a Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina had written a letter to the Swedish authorities in September 2008 urging them not to release Plavšić, stating that "any act of mercy would be big mistake and an insult to the victims and families of the victims".[15]
On 14 September 2009, Patrick Robinson, President of the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, said Plavšić "appears to have demonstrated substantial evidence of rehabilitation" and had accepted responsibility for their crimes. The Times continued that "Under Swedish law, they become eligible for release 27 October, after serving two-thirds of their term, though their release date has not been set."[16] They were released on 27 October 2009.[17] On the same day, Milorad Dodik, Prime Minister of Republika Srpska, provided an RS government jet to pick up Plavšić and welcomed them to Belgrade after their early release from a Swedish prison.[18] Dodik cited "purely moral reasons" for doing so.[19]
On 10 November 2009, Milorad Dodik revealed that they seriously considered giving Plavšić an office in the Senate. They stated "we are working on revising the law on the President of the Republic, which would award Plavšić, and other former presidents, the opportunity to enjoy some privileges like the office, monetary compensation, counselor, secretary, official car with a driver and so forth."[20]

The Attorney General of Indiana penned an op-ed at the Indy Star on June 1st that logically breaks down their opposition to the legalization of marijuana, for medicine or adult-use. AG Curtis Hill presents an arrogantly written 680 word opinion with the same tiresome and hysterical arguments against legalization we expect from prohibitionist conservatives.
Quickly arriving at Stage I, they start off their lecture to the people of Indiana by patronizing the experts and scientists who have been studying cannabis, and the patients that have been using cannabis for decades, explaining, “Those who understand marijuana's dangers must speak the truth.”
Their Stage II symptoms were obvious in their next comments which are a checklist of pseudo-scientific studies and nit-picked outcomes from government funded drug abuse studies that suit their incoherent point of view. They trot out comments like, “One in six adolescents who use marijuana becomes addicted,” and “Heavy users of marijuana report lower life satisfaction.” They finally pull out the impaired driving card, citing an obscure British study on how your risk of a crash is 92% higher if driving under the influence of marijuana.
Believe it or not, they also draw a link between marijuana and increased crime. This is the first and most telling symptom of Stage III Reefer Madness. From Indystar.com:
Eighty percent of men arrested for crimes in Sacramento in 2012 tested positive for at least one illegal drug. The most common was marijuana — found in 54 percent of the arrestees. As reported by McClatchy Newspapers, this data comes from former President Obama's director of national drug-control policy. Advocates of legalizing pot find it easy to dismiss all data contradicting their pro-weed mindset. Ignoring marijuana's addictive properties, they focus exclusively on light and moderate users to generate “evidence” favorable to their agenda.
The signs of Stage IV Madness come from their final comments, where they question the medicinal validity of whole plant cannabis. They refer to a Institute of Medicine report that concluded, “if there is any future for marijuana as a medicine, it lies in its isolated components, the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives.”
They wrap up their comments with a jab at profiteering and “legalized dope-dealing” by calling for a ban on all marijuana legalization in the Hoosier state. They conclude:
Let's hope that day never comes. Rather than follow the crowd – rather than even flirting with the folly of legalizing marijuana — Indiana lawmakers should stand firm in their resolve to keep our state on a better path.
It is no surprise that a state which elected Mike Pence, our current Vice President, is conservative regarding many things, but medical marijuana and the criminalization of the use of this plant in any way is 1970's thinking. As they briefly mentioned, 29 states have recovered from the Reefer Madness and into reality, with no bad side effects. It is time for Indiana to begin treating their sickness which starts with a new Attorney General.
Alright, here it is. I've chosen GitHub and set up a profile, an organization and a public Repository under the GPL 3.0 license. This is where FRONTIERS' code is going to be made available for modders and enthusiasts.Now what? Organizing this is... daunting.First off, I won't be uploading the entire project to GitHub because there are third-party libraries that I can't redistribute (yet). Instead I'll be uploading the pieces that I know for sure are free and clear. Over time I'll add dependencies as I secure permission from the authors.That means people won't be able to compile something that, you know, runs. They won't even be able to supply the missing dependencies from a third party because in most cases I've modified the middleware I'm using. They'll just be able to look at pieces. Does this break some kind of GitHub code? Are repositories for projects expected to be complete? I dunno.Then there's the problem of how to incorporate other people's changes back into the main project. (I'm assuming someone, somewhere may actually want to change something.)Right now I've got a local project. I edit that, then commit my changes to a remote SVN repository. Given that setup, what to do if someone out there sees fit to commit a change to GitHub, and I see fit to incorporate that change into my local project? Is it even possible to mix and match two svn repositories at once? If not, what happens if I slip up and don't commit my local changes to GitHub for a week and that person has now altered an outdated version of a class?*Mind boggles*Alright. Well. I've created the repository. First step: complete.

Osama Bin Laden's son has applied for a British visa so they can live in Britain with their wife.
Omar Bin Laden, 26, who admits attending terror training with the Al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan, has been interviewed with their wife Jane Felix-Browne, 52, by British Embassy officials in Cairo, where they are currently living.
The couple plan to set up house in Jane's £550,000 home in Moulton, Cheshire, have a child through a surrogate mother and work as "peace activists".
Scroll down for more
Omar and six-times-married Jane, who has changed their name to Zaina Al Sabah Bin Laden, have given the embassy access to their bank accounts to allow checks on the authenticity of their relationship.
The son of the world's most wanted man has divorced their first wife, the mother of their two-year-old son, to prove their marriage to Jane is genuine.
The couple claim they have been assured the visa application will be given the green light when the embassy receives the divorce documents from Saudi Arabia, proving Omar is solely married to Jane.
They and Jane, who has three sons and five grandchildren, married following a whirlwind romance in September 2006 after meeting outside the Pyramids in Cairo.
The couple made their application to the embassy in Cairo last November.
A UK marriage visa would give Omar, the fourth son of the architect of the 9/11 Twin Towers outrage, "leave to remain in the UK" with no time limit on their stay.
Initially, visas for spouse immigration are for two years, after which a person can apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain, which would make Omar eligible for a UK passport.
Jane said: "The embassy staff are all very friendly and they are doing all the checks. It could take a while for the visa to come through but there's no reason in law why Omar and I should not be able to live in the UK together.
"It is very easy to get a tourist visa. Other members of Omar's family have had them, but we have applied for a settlement visa. We would stay in Cheshire where I have a house.
"We have been told there will not be a problem as long as we can provide the original documents from their divorce from
their first wife. And that should be done in a week."
Meanwhile, the couple are organising a 3,000-mile horse ride from Cairo to Morocco in support of "peace" and in defiance of the threat of terrorist attacks in the area.
Earlier this month, the famous Dakar Rally for cars and motorbikes from Lisbon across north-west Africa to Senegal was cancelled because of fears of an
Al Qaeda attack.
Last month four French tourists were murdered in Mauritania – through which much of the rally runs.
But Omar, who last saw their father in Afghanistan in 2000, told The Mail on Sunday:
"Associates of my father forced the cancellation of the Dakar Rally, but they won't stop me from riding.
"We want people to join us on the trek – Jews, Arabs, Christians, Muslims, it doesn't matter where people are from."
Jane and Omar reportedly divorced last year, but it had been staged following a series of death threats. Jane says they are now looking for a surrogate mother so that they can have a child with their new husband.
Immigration lawyer Laura Divine said the Home Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office would usually accept an application for a marriage and settlement visa if all the eligibility criteria were satisfied.
They added: "They would want to see Bin Laden's divorce papers because it is the woman in this case applying for their husband to join her, and that husband must have only one wife."
The British Embassy refused to comment on individual cases.
In Jane's home village of Moulton, neighbours told of their surprise that Osama Bin Laden's son wanted to move from Egypt.
One said: "There's something different every couple of weeks – the last I knew they were getting divorced.
"Why would Bin Laden want to come to this cold, miserable climate? Give me Egypt any day."
A Chinese city is planning to fine women who have children out of wedlock - a policy which opponents say will lead to more abandoned children.
The plans, drawn up by family planning officials in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, would target women who "knowingly have children out of wedlock", according to a report in the Global Times newspaper. Unmarried mothers could be charged six times the annual per capita disposable income in Wuhan, a figure equivalent to about $26,000. Officials referred to the fines as "social compensation fees". Chinese state media said the law would help keep the birth rate low and aid family planning management. The law was announced just days after a newborn baby boy was rescued from a sewage pipe in Zhejiang province. Reports suggest that the unmarried mother was shunned by the father, such is the social stigma of single parenthood in China.
Chen Yaya, of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, warned there could be more "sewer babies" if the policy is enacted.
Wang Qiong, a professor at Wuhan University, told the China Daily the regulation was "ridiculous".
"What if a woman chooses to have a test tube baby without getting married? Should they also be fined?"
The Global Times said that the fines would target unmarried women who cannot prove the identity of the father of their child, or those who have a baby with men who they know have spouses.
Can reduce traffic-related noise pollution by 95%-99%.
Will help reduce possibility of hearing impairment, hypertension and other noise-related ailments
Installation is very cheap (around Rs 300) and it is easy to use
Can be implemented on a large scale in short period of time
BENGALURU: Despite awareness campaigns and health warnings issued by doctors, deafening traffic continues to shatter Bengaluru's peace. Having been at the receiving end for long, two engineering students have devised a solution to curb the honking menace - a smart device which can be used instead of horns.It took Vikas Jangid and Saloni Sarkar three weeks to create the infra-red transmitter. The third-year students of electrical and electronics engineering from CMR Institute of Technology (CMRIT) were helped by their mentor Dr Shyamsundar Hegde . The device is expected to reduce traffic-related noise pollution by 95%-99%."Pressure horns can be replaced by the transmitter, which will allow an LED light placed in the vehicle's dashboard to glow. This will alert the driver of the vehicle in front about the presence of the car behind, eliminated the need for a horn and automatically bringing down noise pollution levels," said Vikas.Elaborating how the device functions, Saloni said: A pair of infra-red (IR) receivers will be fitted in the front and rear bumpers of the vehicle and a switch will installed in the steering wheel instead of a horn. When a driver presses the switch, infra-red rays will be emitted and detected by the IR receiver of the vehicle in front, lighting up the LED. This will alert the driver about the vehicle at the back".Ask the students what prompted them to develop the transmitter and pat comes the reply. "On our way to college, we are invariably caught up in traffic. Mindless honking is a big put off and we felt the need to come up with an answer. IR detectors can also sense the type of vehicle behind - LED lights of different colours will indicate the presence of different vehicles. We are in the process of developing an alarm system which can be used in congested parking areas or while reversing a vehicle. A buzzer can also be fitted, which is only audible inside the vehicle," they said.

Welcome to my monthly income report for October 2015!
Each month I will try to publish a detailed account of what is happening in my online businesses, including earnings and goings on a month by month (as well as lessons learned).
My intention is to keep track of my own progress and to make it public so people like you can learn from my successes and failures.
This is my first month, and I decided to do it because I believe this is a great success for my first month blogging. Hurray! I started with zero experience and I'm already making money. I'm so motivated! 🙂
If you feel like you want to follow my blogging journey from today, you can subscribe below and I will send you updates every month about how I'm progressing with my blog.

Now, let's go to the core of what you are here for.
IMPORTANT STUFF IN OCTOBER 2015
October has been the best month so far since I started in January 2015, and even more considering it has been my most busy month since then. Busy in terms of personal stuff. My wife got a job near London and since we are living currently in Cambridge we have been kind of busy looking for houses to move in.
Due to my previous experience gained during my last 9 months, in October 2015 I decided to create Passive Income Wise (PIW). I didn't really know much about how I am gonna do it or what kind of content I would include. Inspired by some people like Pat Flynn from SPI, Matthew Allen from Dumb Passive Income or Alexander from Cash Flow Diaries I decided to start my own path to spread to the world my experience with Online Marketing. So yes, I consider this a big deal and it deserves to be included in this section.
I took $159.38 from my savings and I created this website with the help of Bluehost. I have previous experience with other hosting companies but I was very curious about Bluehost, and that is why I tried this time. Zero problems so far. Click here if to learn how to start a blog with WordPress and Bluehost.
INCOME REPORT
Google Adsense: $66.23
Previous Month: $44.39
Difference: + $21.84
This is a big jump for me. When I first started I told myself that I would be satisfied if I can reach a threshold of $50/month, but now that I reached it I know it is not enough, that I can do much more and I will put effort on that.
Out of the income earned with Adsense, $32.05 are directly from clicks (with a CPC of $0.14), $27.34 are from Views, $5.26 from Active Views and $1.60 from Engagements.
YouTube: $1.78
Previous Month: $1.55
Difference: + $0.23
Considering that I didn't update any video during October I consider $1.78 a good amount for doing “nothing” new.
Amazon Affiliate Program: $7.90
Previous Month: Not implemented.
October has been the first month I tried Amazon Affiliate and it resulted to be pretty good. Money not expected at all, I like it. I have one banner on the right side of the website with a product from Amazon that I consider useful for my readers. I sold 4 items, however, none of them are the recommended product.
Bluehost: £0.00 ($0.00)
Previous Month: £0.00 ($0.00)
Difference: + £0.00 ($0.00)
I totally expected this. I only have one banner and it's by the end of my niche site in a place that very little people scroll down. Plus it is not an interest based advertisement since my niche is an Adsense site. Let's see if in future I get lucky with it.
EXPENSES
Bluehost hosting service (for 1 year): $159.38
Previous Month: Not included.
Difference: £0.00 ($0.00)
Includes Domain name. I don't include this in the Net Total balance because they are considered as start-up costs and they will be included in the year balance.
Net Total Balance: $75.91
October was a great month, with a large jump due to an increase of 50% on Adsense revenue and the incorporation of Amazon products. I didn't expect to have any earnings with Amazon that early, but it is a nice surprise.
TRAFFIC AND METRICS
Since Passive Income Wise was launched one week ago there is not enough data to report it. Therefore, the reported here correspond to my niche site.
Page views: 225,351 (+122,544 compared to September 2015)
Wow! Double than last month, that is incredible! I need to recognise that many of them are due to a couple of posts that went viral, but every month I have some posts going viral so it is a real improvement.
I believe this increase in traffic is due to the hard work put over the last 3 months. I thought it would never happen. Now I am satisfied and I know what is the path to follow to continue improving: create amazing content.
Niche Site 1 is ranking 20 in Google for the keyword targeted but 99% of the people accessing is because of Long Tail Keywords. Lesson learned? Focus long tail keywords, they are the key!
Number of new people visiting the site: 42,888
I calculated it doing the following calculation: (Sessions) x (%New Sessions).
42k new people who visited Niche Site 1. Can you see the scope of these numbers as I do? 42k new people means 42,000 potential permanent visitors if what they found satisfied their needs. That's amazing!!
But now, let's have a look at the different types of traffic we've got.
Since the beginning, I have been targeting Organic Traffic because it's the one that gives you real passive income. Is the permanent traffic that will be always there no matter if you continue creating content or not. Of course, I will continue creating content but October has been the real example of a month which I didn't publish a lot of content and still it generated tons of traffic.
Social traffic is mainly coming from Facebook and Reddit and a little bit from Twitter. I found some months back the importance of sharing your posts in matching Reddit communities as people can give you good feedback and comments.
11,680 of traffic from Direct looks promising, most of them are coming from Bookmarks meaning they liked those posts. Really satisfied with this number.
Referral traffic is important as well, but I didn't work in creating backlinks since several months back, so I believe it's fair the low amount traffic coming for referrals.
Google Adsense Metrics
I would really like to share more data from my Adsense account but since the politics of Adsense are very restrictive I will post the maximum I can.
Cost per Click (CPC): $0.14
Clicks: 341 with a total of 301k ads impressions
Page RPM: $0.47
Now you will wonder why this low CPC and RPM. The explanation here: Niche Site 1 is in a niche that is not lucrative, however as you can see it is easy to get a high volume of traffic. When I first created Niche Site 1 the idea wasn't making money out of it but with the time I realised the potentiality of creating a small business with it. Still, I'm happy with the numbers, sounds like a good beginning.
SOCIAL MEDIA
I will try to separate the social media activities corresponding to different websites. So far I have only two to report: Niche Site 1 (NS1) and Passive Income Wise (PIW).
Facebook
Niche Site 1 (NS1).
Likes Page: 1,230 (+168 New Likes)
Group Members: 480 (+31 New Members)
Friends: 1,367 (+50 New friends)
What I did to increase this numbers is just sharing my new posts and reply some of the comments. The increase is very low due to the low content added in October.
Passive Income Wise (PIW). Like Passive Income Wise on Facebook
Likes Page: 0
Group Members: 0
Friends: 0
Just started, 0 friends and likes. Hoping that next month will be some more.
Twitter
Niche Site 1 (NS1)
Followers: 294 (+13 New Followers)
I don't really use Twitter despite I know how powerful can it be, but for my audience, Twitter is not very common so I don't put much effort on it. I have the auto share every time I publish something new.
Passive Income Wise (PIW).
Followers: 0
Not created a Twitter account yet.
YouTube
Niche Site 1 (NS1)
Subscribers: 295 (+39 New Subscribers)
I only uploaded one video during October. 39 new subscribers look cool. Each video takes quite a lot of time in comparison with what I take from it but still, I will continue creating some more.
I don't intend to create YouTube channel for Passive Income Wise, at least not now, we'll see in future.
Email List
Niche Site 1 (NS1)
Subscriptions: 351 (+14 New Subscriptions)
During October 2015 I deleted the registration form because it was giving some problems. The 14 new subscriptions are coming from the comments box that has a click to register. Currently, my email list is with Mail Chimp but I would like to change to Aweber or any other more professional service.
I didn't create an email list for PIW yet but it will come soon.
FUTURE WORK AND TARGETS
As a future work for November 2015 the followings are my targets:
Create all kind of social media for Passive Income Wise (Twitter, Google+, etc).
Start building an email list .
Create content for Passive Income Wise.
Organise and structure this website.
Generate traffic through the creation of content.
Implement Shareasale affiliate in Niche Site 1.
I'm sure you realised that most of the work is related to this blog, it's because from today is my One Thing and I'm 100% focused on improving PIW right now.

Golden Gate Bridge rescue: CHP saves kitten, officer fosters them
CHP officers rescued a kitten stranded on the Golden Gate Bridge Saturday, June 24. Officer Smith, one of the rescuers, is fostering the kitten and nursing it back to health.

California Highway Patrol officers responded to an unusual call on the Golden Gate Bridge Saturday afternoon.
While crossing the bridge, a concerned citizen saw a flash of orange. It wasn't the rusty hue of the famous landmark, but a kitten stranded inside a moveable median barrier.
CHP officers from the Golden Gate Division missed the cat on their first bridge crossing, but later noticed its "little furry head popping out," according to a post shared on the department's Facebook page.
The officers blocked one lane of traffic and quickly pulled the kitten to safety. They then brought the cat to VCA Madera Pet Hospital in Corte Madera for a health exam and a “much-needed bath,” said the post.
Without a microchip and collar, VCA staff could not identify the kitten's owners so Officer Smith, one of the cat's rescuers, stepped up to foster the kitten and nurse them back to health.
“We are very perplexed as to how they managed to get so far out in the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge without being hit by another vehicle,” the post said. “Until then, this cute little guy, tentatively named Bridges, is on their way to a new home with people who will take great care of him.”
Golden Gate CHP asks those who may have lost their cat on the bridge to give them a call.

Putting the “Micro” in Microservices with WildFly Swarm
Do you like JavaEE apps, but wonder how to fit them into a microservices-centric workflow? WildFly Swarm is the answer.
I know—“Java” and “microservices” are not words that seem to go together. Java is an old, relatively unsexy programming language. It's a pretty useful one, but it was created long before the era of Continuous Delivery, containers and microservices.
But that doesn't mean you have to give up on Java if you want to take advantage of microservices. WildFly Swarm makes it easy to split the difference between Java development and microservices deployment by sizing down your JavaEE apps.
Keep reading for an overview of how WildFly Swarm optimizes JavaEE deployment, and a quick guide to getting started with WildFly Swarm.
How WildFly Swarm Works
In September 2016, the most recent version of WildFly Swarm (2016.9), was released. WildFly Swarm builds on the foundation of WildFly, the JavaEE application server formerly known as JBoss, to better facilitate Java EE microservice development.
Simply put, WildFly Swarm lets you take a JavaEE app and boil it down to only the essential parts necessary to run it as an uber-JAR file. The result is a leaner, meaner way to deploy Java apps.
If this sounds a bit like unikernels, that's because it is. But while unikernels in general are a cool idea that has yet to be widely implemented in practice, WildFly Swarm is here and ready for production now.

Why WildFly Swarm?
At this point, you may be wondering why you'd want to include a customized application service inside an uber-JAR with your application. After all, it's not as if traditional Java application servers are the biggest thing taking up space on your infrastructure. And Java deployments via WildFly are already pretty fast.
That said, why run your Java apps in an application server that has many pieces that aren't used? By cutting out the fat via WildFly Swarm, you get an app and application server combined uber-JAR that sucks up less memory, and is more responsive. Plus, by eliminating unnecessary overhead, they improve security because they reduce your apps' exposure.
Packaging as an uber-JAR is a perfect fit for providing a single artifact to be passed through the entire CI/CD pipeline. While also ensuring that what was tested is exactly what's in production, as there are no longer any concerns with differing application server configurations between environments.
In short, WildFly Swarm lets you fully embrace all the benefits of a microservices-oriented development and deployment workflow. You no longer have to take a monolithic approach to building and running JavaEE apps. Instead, you can compile and deploy just the parts you need, and leave out everything you don't.
Setting Up WildFly Swarm
Excited yet? If not, consider also that deploying WildFly Swarm is pretty trivial if you already have a Java EE project. You just add the wildfly-swarm-plugin to your pom.xml file between plugin tags, like so:
<plugin> <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId> <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId> <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version> <executions> <execution> <phase>package</phase> <goals> <goal>package</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> </plugin>
You also need a dependency block like:
<dependency> <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId> <artifactId>jaxrs</artifactId> <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version> <scope>provided</scope> </dependency>
From there, you just build your project. You'll get a WildFly Swarm-enabled JAR, which will put a traditional application server to shame in terms of leanness and resource optimization.
For a deeper dive into what WildFly Swarm can do, you can check out examples on GitHub. And complete documentation is available from the WildFly Swarm website.

When Voyager 1 thundered away from Cape Canaveral on Sept. 5, 1977, its primary mission was to explore the solar system, but the extras were what engaged the public imagination. In a utopian anticipation of its discovery by extraterrestrial intelligence somewhere Out There, the NASA probe — and its Voyager 2 twin — was fitted with a gold-plated disc featuring samples of 115 languages, music, photos and the natural sounds of life on Earth.
Both spacecraft flashed past Pluto way back in 1990, and scientists are debating whether or not the vehicles have actually departed our solar system. Either way, nearly 36 years later, at more than 18 billion kilometers from Earth, Voyager 1 is the farthest flung hardware our species has ever created.
“As technology advances in complexity and scope, fear becomes more primitive.” ― Don DeLillo/CREDIT: swissnexsanfrancisco.org
Three years after the Voyagers left home, nanotechnologist Robert Freitas leaped many generations ahead and co-authored a NASA feasibility study on self-replicating probes (SRPs). They contemplated what it would take for advanced space-faring technology not only to repair and perpetuate itself during missions, but also to improvise on destination targeting as it forged the cosmic oceans. Among the motivations for this exercise was a theoretical test of the Fermi Paradox, in which physicist Enrico Fermi alleged, in 1950, that if ET civilizations existed, we would've known it by now. “Where are they?” they wondered.
In 1983, Freitas confronted the Paradox in the International Journal of the British Interplanetary Society by suggesting that ET probes — not quite as naive as our little Voyagers — might be more discerning before initiating contact. They hypothesized that ET engineers would be too smart to dispatch scout vessels capable of breaking down into derelict shells subject to recovery by inferior societies. Freitas envisioned a scenario in which these auto-repair SRPs might also camouflage their presence and maintain communications blackouts until the “recipient species” could pass a “threshold test” for native intelligence or technological prowess. They suggested SRPs could be exploring our neighborhood even as we speak.
This provocative notion was challenged in the July edition of The International Journal of Astrobiology by Scottish mathematicians Arwen Nicholson and Duncan H. Forgan at the University of Edinburgh. Nicholson and Forgan proposed that, without goring the sacred cow of light speed, ET engineers from older civilizations could design Voyager-sized SRPs and, using stars for gravitational velocity assists, “slingshot” them across the void up to 100 times faster than the Voyagers.
It's a far-out idea, literally and figuratively. The authors assume that these SRPs, approaching no closer than 10 percent the speed of light, could produce, in transit, multiple, time-saving duplications of themselves, which could then be dispatched to plow, in coordinated fashion, distant corners of the Milky Way Galaxy for signs of intelligent life. Bottom line: SRP fleets using the Nicholson-Forgan algorithms could have surveyed our star system in the relatively short span of 10 million years — plenty of time to have discovered Earth. Lacking evidence of such surveillance, the authors conclude “the question underlying the Fermi Paradox is well posed.”
Given how these SRPs build upon the “post-biological” robotic ET probes proposed in the International Journal of Astrobiology by former NASA historian Steven Dick in 2003, De Void felt compelled to reach out to Dr. Dick about the latest theoretical scenario.
“This is a serious argument against ETI. Since we don't see them here, they don't exist,” they surmised in an email. “Maybe there is no interstellar travel because it's too expensive, physically impossible, too hazardous, or ETI's aren't interested. Or they are here but undetected. Or they just don't exist. Given these possibilities, most astronomers continue to argue we will only know for sure by looking for them with radio searches, etc. UFO reports are another matter …
“There are indeed a very few percent of UFO reports that remain unexplained. But as (Carl) Sagan always said, ‘extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,' and extraordinary evidence is not available (or you would have heard of it!). I conclude there may be something unexplained going on with those few percent, whether something physical, psychological, or sociological, but to jump to the ‘extraterrestrial hypothesis' is unwarranted at this time.”
During our exchange three years ago, Dick informed De Void they had not reviewed MUFON's radar analysis of the 2008 Stephenville Incident, nor had they read Leslie Kean's UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go On the Record, which earned the endorsements of blue-chip astronomers Michio Kaku and Derrick Pitts. Significantly, both declined to paste an extraterrestrial label on the phenomenon; they simply advocated serious UFO research.
Might the furtive and transient nature of most UFO encounters — combined with the stealth/cloaking behaviors reported in so many instances — be a manifestation of Freitas' hypothesized SRP “threshold tests” for gauging intelligence? Why not subject the data to our own rigorous tests? De Void posed the question to Dick in a followup, and also asked if they were familiar with any of the compelling studies published by their former NASA colleague, Richard Haines, at the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena.
This time, Dick didn't bother to answer.
A woman is in the hospital after police say a homeowner shot them
Officers were called to 2512 N. Edgewood Terrace at about 2:30 a.m. Thursday after several people said they saw a woman in several yards going up to houses. Neighbors said the woman looked "suspicious."
Police say one homeowner came outside to find the woman in their backyard and shot them They were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Officer Brad Perez with FWPD says it's believed the woman was known to a neighbor and had gotten into a fight at another home before they wandered through the neighborhood. An A/C unit at one home was found damaged and turned on its side, Perez said.
The homeowner who fired their gun told police they had been burglarized before and thought it might be happening again.
The woman will be charged with criminal mischief.

Qld police recruit real estate agents to help track down backyard drug labs
Updated
Sorry, this video has expired Video: Qld Police recruit real estate agents (ABC News)
Queensland police are recruiting real estate agents to help them find and dismantle clandestine drug laboratories.
A training program has been established to teach rental property managers how to spot illegal activity and potentially collect evidence during inspections.
The strategy appears to be having some early success.
Detective Senior Sergeant Geoff Marsh from the Brisbane drug squad says investigators have uncovered a record number of backyard drug labs this year in Queensland alone.
"They've been of great assistance to us," they said.
"We show them what to look for and they ring us."
An increasing number of small-scale drug manufacturers operate from rental properties to avoid having their own homes seized if they are caught by authorities.
Police say real estate agents are in the unique position of being able to inspect those properties and are being encouraged to carry out detective work on their behalf.
"It might be the piece of the jigsaw that we require to execute a search warrant and take the drugs off the streets," Detective Marsh said.
One problem is that tenants are usually given at least seven days' notice of a property inspection, which is more than enough time for them to cover their tracks.
Illicit drug laboratories: telltale signs Police say there are a number of indicators that might suggest a property is home to a clandestine drug laboratory.
The average clandestine drug laboratory is surprisingly small and experts say they can be packed up and hidden away within minutes.
Detective Marsh says real estate agents are being trained to look for individual utensils and ingredients rather than a fully functioning drug lab.
"They might find acid under one sink and a base under another," they said.
"They might find a bit of tubing with two holes coming out of it.
"It might indicate to them that this could be one of those drug labs the police told us about."
Some agents concerned about repercussions
Brisbane property manager Clint Dowdell-Smith says some real estate agents who took part in the training were initially concerned about the consequences of dobbing in their tenants.
"It was certainly a question that was asked in the recent training," they said.
"How safe is the information that we do hand over to the police and how safe are we from repercussions from the tenants?
"We have been assured that any information that we do provide is anonymous and the police do follow through discreetely on that."
Mr Dowdell-Smith says the training is important given the number of stories they hear from colleagues about the discovery of suburban methamphetamine labs.
"It seems to be becoming more prevalent so we certainly needed help from police," they said.
"When you hear the word 'lab' you expect big glass beakers and big set-ups but it certainly can be something that can be packed up into a suitcase and put into a cupboard."
Mr Dowdell-Smith says the training has taught their staff to look for excessive amounts of household chemicals and medicines.
They say they will also be on the lookout for drawn curtains, locked doors and tenants who consistently postpone inspections and use increasingly creative excuses.
Police say prospective tenants can also exhibit warning signs such as offering large sums of cash to secure a lease.
Soaring popularity of drug known as ice
Police say they have already uncovered 350 clandestine drug labs in Queensland this year, compared to a total of 330 last year.
The drug of choice for many manufacturers is crystalline methamphetamine or ice, as demand has been growing in recent years.
The rise in demand is also reflected in the number of drug seizures on Australia's borders.
The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service's annual report shows there were 1,084 detections of ice in the 2012-13 financial year.
That compares with 171 in 2011-12 and 160 in 2010-11.
A recent survey of drug users in Queensland found 52 per cent said the drug was very easy to obtain, while 42 per cent said it was easy to obtain.
Queensland Health says the number of people presenting to hospital emergency departments suffering methamphetamine poisoning has risen from 266 in 2009 to 458 so far this year.

As the mainstream media attempts to distract the public from pressing issues and turn us on each other based on race, gender, religion, and political affiliation, they prefer to whitewash a major issue that could be unifying for all free Americans. There's a lot about racism and Muslims today that they left doesn't want you to know, but it's time to deal with the elephant in the room.
While many are aware that Arabs enslaved a lot of blacks and the mainstream media won't tell you about the horrors of the “religion of peace,” few on the left realize the enslavement of blacks by Muslims is still going on today. The Atlanta Black Star put together a very insightful video detailing the horrors of Muslims and the enslavement of Africans. It even enlightens viewers on the abuse of African women and the rapes and torture they endured while being forced to give birth to other Arab children.
This video is in no way meant to “atone” for slavery in America, but rather shed light on the constant and ongoing debate about race relations in the United States. Although not all Arabs are Muslims, the idea that women who were slaves were sexual objects to their masters originated in the Quran, Islam's “holy” text. Muslims are directed to emulate their prophet Muhammed, who was not only a slave trader but a pedophile, rapist, and warmonger as well. With this as Islam's example of the “perfect man,” it bears knowing and addressing, yet it's too sensitive for the mainstream media, so we must tell you what they won't.
Slavery, including sex slavery, is rampantly supported in Islam's teachings. In fact, the “Quran devotes more verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as sex slaves than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero),” according to The Religion of Peace. The video below details the horrific treatment of slaves, specifically blacks, at the hands of Arabs. Many males were castrated or had all of their genitalia cut off to prevent reproduction. The footage also sheds some light on the sheer number of black Africans who suffered during the Arab slave trade.
10 Facts About The Arab Enslavement Of Black People Not Taught… 10 Facts About The Arab Enslavement Of Black People Not Taught In Schools Posted by Atlanta Black Star on Wednesday, September 28, 2016
Obviously, blacks weren't the only slaves to ever be taken and tortured at the hands of the Arabs. Muslims also enslaved whites. It is estimated that about 1.25 million whites were forced into slavery by Arabs during the Barbary slave trades. The Islamists who participated in the Barbary slave trades didn't care about the race of their slaves. They simply needed women to abuse and men to do hard labor in exchange for beatings and worse.
Although the video did not focus on it and the mainstream media is desperately trying to prevent it from becoming common knowledge, blacks are still enslaved by Muslims today as they emulate their prophet Muhammad was a major racist. They called their black slaves “raisin heads,” treated them “worse than dogs,” and even said Satan themselves was black.
None of these facts will be presented to you via the mainstream media. That's because the MSM has an odd desire to allow Muslims to flood the West, but how can we expect those who are commanded to be exactly like the murdering pedophile who abused others for their enjoyment to assimilate to our values? There is a reason some do not “tolerate” Islam but rather boldly speak against its ideals, and it isn't out of racism or because some are religious zealots. The reason many don't tolerate this ideology is because we refuse to tolerate murder, rape, slavery, pedophilia, and the abuse of women — all things which are encouraged and permissible in the Quran. To embrace Islam is to throw away our own values, including basic human rights for all.
Dark chocolate nowadays is popularly known as one of the best superfoods. If you nibble dark chocolate to satisfy a craving, you are also helping your heart with every bite, say experts.

Sonia Narang, Wellness and Nutrition Expert, Oriflame India and Meher Rajput, Nutritionists and Dietician, FITPASS share that how dark chocolates can be healthy too. Dark chocolate is also preloaded with decent amounts of soluble fiber and potential minerals. It contains Oleic acid, Stearic acid, and Palmitic acid.
Loaded with organic compounds which are biologically active, dark chocolate can help lower blood pressure and improve the flow of blood in your body. It greatly helps in decreasing the levels of oxidised LDL Cholesterol in men. Eating dark chocolate (which has 65 percent polyphenol-rich cocoa) helps to lower blood pressure naturally.
Flavanols found in dark chocolate help in improving your heart health by lowering blood pressure and refining the flow of blood to the heart as well as to the brain. They also help in reducing the risk of cancer.

Dark chocolate also reduces the level of insulin resistance, which is a very common factor behind the birth of diseases like Diabetes, Cardiovascular disease, and other heart ailments. Dark chocolate also has a high concentration of an alkaloid called theobromine which has stimulant properties and relaxing effects. It can dilate the blood vessels.
To be fair to a woman who has established that she's a racist a-hole, we are relying on secondhand accounts of a talk which Bethenny Frankel gave to a room of women business owners, at a conference called Project Entrepreneur. Jezebel compiled the responses to Bethenny's speech and several attendees were outraged. Bethenny allegedly (again this is secondhand as there is no video) told minority women that they should hire white male spokespeople for their businesses. Several attendees tweeted about this. Bethenny also reportedly suggested using sex for business purposes. When two women of color got up during the Q&A session to tell Bethenny how wrong they are, they were shut down.
An entrepreneur named Mary Pryor blogged about their experience trying to question Bethenny about their offensive speech:
I was one of the women who tried to stand up to reality TV star and Skinny Girl Vodka founder, Bethenny Frankel, at a women's entrepreneurial summit over the weekend. And was silenced. As a participant in Rent The Runway's and UBS's Project Entrepreneur, a new initiative to equip women founders with the tools and advice they need to thrive in the marketplace, I was stunned when Frankel implied that women should have sex with men in exchange for capital. I was offended when they expressed some kind of kinship with black women because she's “loud.” And I was taken aback when they advised those of us in the room to get business advice to hire a white man as the face of our companies. The session was not recorded, but it caused a firestorm both in New York City, where the event took place, and on social media. Another female founder of color, Naomi Hirabayashi of Shine Text, was just as disturbed given this response. Many of the women of color in the audience turned their heads in shock. Some took to the mic, prepared to address the inflammatory remarks. While Frankel's flawed advice comes with unfortunate truths regarding access to funding- white men do get the lion's share of venture capital funding while black women founders don't seem to even register on the radar. This phenomenon was most recently covered in Digital Undivided's #ProjectDiane report; it's clear tech has a long way to go when it comes to supporting black women founders. Armed with this knowledge, I weighed the pros and cons of responding to Frankel after I saw eye rolling, dismissive stares, and “Here they go!” reactions from other women in the room but. Something needed to be said. Not even when the wrong-headedness was called to their attention, Frankel didn't back down. Nothing. No apology. No acknowledgement of an ignorant reply. Just a comment from a moderator about “breaking up a fight” and removing the mic from our hands. Naomi and I stood there shaking our heads. We stood up to defend female founders of color. They stood up as an ally aware of bias and ignorance in tech. We came together respectfully and left disappointed.
[From The Huffington Post via Jezebel]
Project Entrepreneur has since apologized while Bethenny has tweeted some nonsense about color not mattering. You know that means they said all these obnoxious things.
I don't care if ur woman,man, black,white,hispanic,green or purple.In biz & life be better than everyone else.Don't complain.Don't explain. — Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) April 13, 2016
Here are some tweets about this speech:
(4) For @Bethenny to insist that a young, Black female founder "Find a white guy" to rep their biz is a racial microaggression #PEIntensive16 — Mary Pryor (@msmarypryor) April 11, 2016
To the brave black woman who asked what to do when ppl tell them to get a white man as the face of their org,Im so sorry for @Bethenny's answer — Marah Lidey (@marahml) April 9, 2016
Convo w/ @bethenny: should u do whatever it takes 2 succeed like hiring a white male spokesperson as a minority entrepreneur? #PEIntensive16 — Ellen Choi (@LNchoi) April 9, 2016
1.Hi @msmarypryor TY for standing up+speaking your mind. The fact that you felt shut down is completely contrary to the goals of the weekend — Project Entrepreneur (@pjtentrepreneur) April 11, 2016
We apologize to you and our guests. — Project Entrepreneur (@pjtentrepreneur) April 11, 2016
Project Entrepreneur went one further and tweeted that Bethenny was wrong, essentially and that “We believe that every founder is enough on their own. We disagree with any sentiments to the contrary.” I hope this means that businesses and organizations will think twice before giving Bethenny a platform, but then I see the orange idiot who's running for president and realize that there are a lot of racists who are being given platforms lately.
Update: Bethenny has denied saying this despite the many eyewitness accounts and they have gone on to block several people on Twitter insisting they said it.
Today, you're going to level up your life.
If you're anything like me, you're big on the whole “come up with ideas” part of life and slightly lacking in the “JUST DO IT” part. You've told yourself for days, weeks, months, years that you're going to get in shape one day – enough with the excuses, procrastination, and delays.
It's time for action!
Here are 43 different ways to improve your life right now. I'm a huge fan of momentum, and I'm confident that picking a thing or two off of this list and following through with it could help you turn that little snowball of yours into an avalanche of awesome. While most of these are fitness related, some have nothing to do with fitness but will help you either feel better, look better, or help make this world a slightly better place.
Let's do this!
1) Write down everything you eat today. Every calorie, every bite of a donut, every sip of a soda. Everything. I'll bet you eat more calories than you think…unless you're trying to gain weight, in which case I bet you eat less than you think.
2) Eat less. If you want to lose weight, you have to burn more calories than you consume. If you want to gain weight, you need to burn less calories than you consume.
3) Try a new vegetable. They won't hurt, I promise.
4) Stop slouching! Pull your shoulder blades back and pick your chin up. You'll look thinner, project more confidence, and your lower back will stop hurting from sitting improperly all day.
5) Write down three goals. Write down three things right now that you need to accomplish in order for your day to feel productive. Do the first thing, and then then second, and then the third. Simple.
6) Stop drinking soda. Even the diet kind.
7) Start lifting weights. I don't care who you are or what your goals are: they should involve some sort of weight training if you want to see legitimate results (here's why). If you're a woman, you should be lifting weights too. Lift HEAVY too (while staying safe).
8 ) Run one second faster today than you did yesterday.
9) Lift one more pound today in the gym than you did last time.
10) Drink more water.
11) Eat breakfast. Eggs and old fashioned oatmeal, good. Sugary cereal with a big glass of OJ (pretty much sugar water), bad.
12) Learn how to do a proper squat. No squat machine, no leg press…a REAL ACTUAL SQUAT with a bar across your shoulders.
13) Don't eat fast food for lunch.
14) Write down what you're going to do in the gym. Don't walk in there blindly, know exactly which exercises you'll do and how much you're going to lift. And then, write down your results as you do them.
15) Stretch after you exercise. All of your muscles are sore and broken down…kick-start the recovery process by stretching out your muscles after working out. Look at the stretching channel on the Nerd Fitness YouTube page if you need examples of some stretches.
16) Start a weight-loss contest at work – Everybody throws in 20 bucks, whoever loses the highest percentage of body weight in a month gets to keep the cash. Money is one hell of a motivator.
17) Go for a brisk walk on your lunch break.
18) Ride your bike to work.
19) Download new workout music.
20) Stop making excuses – Matt lost 157 pounds in only one year because they stopped making excuses and started taking action.
21) Stop using weight machines – They suck and they're dangerous. Be a big boy/girl, go to the free weight section, and pick up some dumbbells.
22) Try interval training. Only have 20 minutes? Try 20 minutes of high-intensity interval training. Kick your ass, burn extra calories, and build up your oxygen capacity in a short amount of time.
23) Sign up for that class you've always wanted to go to but haven't. I signed up for a Capoeira class last week, after putting it off for months. There's never going to be a “perfect” time for anything. Call them today.
24) Do one thing that scares you. Ask out the cute girl at the coffee shop, speak in public (gasp), volunteer for a difficult task at work. It's time to step out of your comfort zone, and grow some bal…confidence. This is one of the most important things you can do for yourself today.
25) Sign up for a race two months from now, and pay in advance. Once you've put the money down, it's going to be tough for you to avoid training unless you want to get beat by a 10-year old girl.
26) Take 15 minutes to clean off your office desk/bedroom. Clutter can cause all kinds of stress and makes life way more complicated than it needs to be. Get rid of the crap, unclutter your desk, unclutter your mind.
27) Sign up for your local library! I've rediscovered the library in my town, which has a surprisingly great collection of fitness and diet books. Just last week I picked up The End of Overeating and The New Rules of Lifting.
28) Start working towards a pull up. You should be doing an exercise that works your ‘pull muscles' with every workout. If you can't do pull ups, try doing body weight rows on a smith machine (or your kitchen table), and if you can't do those yet, do some lat pull downs. Your goal should be to do a few sets up pull ups eventually, so get stronger with each workout.
29) Chuck your junk food. I don't care if you just bought it – get rid of the cookies, crackers, ice cream, soda, Ho-Hos, Twinkies, sugary cereal, whatever. GET RID OF IT, so you won't be tempted.
30) Sign up for a free fitness class. Find a Crossfit gym in your area, and sign up for your free class. Sure, you might puke and you'll be sore as hell, but it's a free ass-kicking…and who knows, you might like it!
31) Give yourself 15 minutes of “me time.” Lock yourself in your room, put on your favorite song, turn off your phone, and just do NOTHING.
32) Run. Stop by the park on the way home, strap on a pair of sneakers, and just start running. Feeling crazy? Try it barefoot.
33) Shake the hand of any person you see that is/was in the military. These brave men and women don't get enough recognition, and you'll be surprised how far a “thank you for your service” and a handshake will go towards making their day and making you feel better. Random? Yup. Good for the world? Yes.
34) Do some push ups! Puff up that chest a little bit. Do incline push ups if regular ones are too hard, and try some dive bombers if they're too easy.
35) Smile more. Not a creepy smile either, but a genuine one.
36) Stop thinking so much. We tend to over-analyze every situation until it's far more complicated and stressful than it needs to be. Sometimes you just need to shut off your brain and go for it.
37) Stop spending thirty minutes sculpting your abs. Add some planks, bird dogs, or knee tucks to your routine to work your core at the end of your routine for no more than five minutes. Your abs are a direct result of your diet anyways, so clean THAT up first, and then worry about abs.
38) Call somebody and tell them that you love them. Your wife/husband, boyfriend/girlfriend, kids, parents, grandparents, whoever. You probably don't say it enough, and you know how great it is to hear it. Spread the love!
39) Sign up for the Nerd Fitness Rebel Army (don't worry, it's free). Get these blog updates delivered to your e-mail inbox, win free stuff if I have things to give away, and get insider info about any cool Rebellion-type stuff going down.
40) Sign up for the Nerd Fitness Message Boards. Join the 280 other people who are posting on there already, and start holding yourself accountable. Plus, then we can discuss the ending to Inception.
41) Get ready for the Rebel Fitness Guide. That's right, this sucker is going to be officially released to the Nerd Fitness population next week! I've poured my heart and soul into this sucker and I'm excited to finally publish it. Check back here next Monday for all the details.
42) Share this article with somebody you care about.
43) ???? What else would you stick on this list? How else can people level up their lives starting today?
Add your suggestions in the comments!
-Steve
PS – Today marks the end of the 4th Nerd Fitness 28-Day Challenge! How did you do? Post on the NF boards how ya did, and start preparing for the next challenge starting next Monday, July 26th!

fox husky christmas tree festive
The second in my new tradition of Christmas card commissions! Though this one was also commissioned as a surprise for a certain husky, so I didn't get to actually put it on any cards. Alas! But still, it was commissioned for Christmas, so let's not argue semantics. I chose blackkrystal to illustrate after meeting them in person and can heartily recommend them for all your art and fursuit needs.
Here kai-llewellyn and I are trying to decorate our tree! Of course it had to be suitably large and impressive, necessitating some sort of team up in order to put the star on the top! Good thing I've plenty of strength or we'd topple over into quite the undignified heap...
Artwork by the talented blackkrystal, Kai is obviously kai-llewellyn! Merry Christmas, husky.
Watercolor Batik Workshop with Ryan Fox
Wavery Artists Group Studio- Cary, NC
Learn a new technique of painting called watercolor batik. Watercolor batik is the process of using traditional watercolor paint and wax to create unique and beautiful batik-style paintings on Japanese rice paper. This process is similar to the age old technique where melted wax is applied to fabric as a resist and then the fabric is dipped in dye.
Students will begin the process with a drawing and then learn to create highlights and shadows, as well as how to mask areas of the project with wax.
This class is suitable for both beginner and experienced painters with little or no watercolor experience. Artists will create a 12x16” batik painting in the class.
Irons, electric skillets, newspapers, wax, and brushes for applying wax will be provided. Artists will need to bring watercolor paints, brushes, and suitable clothing (wax does drip and sometimes ends up on clothing).
Artists can use reference photographs provided for their drawings or are welcome to bring a high contrast photograph or line drawing to transfer to rice paper. A lightbox will be provided for transferring images to rice paper.
When: -May 24th
Both sessions have the same curriculum
Time: 2:00pm to 6:00pm
Price: $75 each class. Max. 6 students

Although it seems that the Labour Government has delayed the Parliamentary rubber stamping, originally scheduled for this Wednesday, to sometime later, perhaps next month, a couple of the Secondary legislation Draft Statutory Instruments which list some more of the the devilish detail of the National Identity Register compulsory centralised biometric database and ID Cards scheme are now available online.
See the previous Spy Blog article: National Identity Cards Scheme creep - 4 Draft Orders laid before Parliament under the Identity Cards Act 2006
The two new Draft SIs are:
The Identity Cards Act 2006 (Prescribed Information) Regulations 2009 This gives a glimpse of the Prescribed Information which will be in plaintext and that which will be Encrypted on the actual ID SmartCard. Why there needs to be a specific clause about membership of the Privy Council, is a mystery. Note that there is no provision for mandating the encryption of the data once it is floating about the Government's or Private Sector partners computer networks .(something which the incompetently draughted, anti-Denial of Service attack inspired Section 29 Tampering with the Register etc. inadvertently criminalises )
The Identity Cards Act 2006 (Application and Issue of ID Card and Notification of Changes) Regulations 2009
There are two major issues with the detail of this latter SI, both to do with the extra information which ALL Applicants (for a new entry on the National Identity Register, or for a Modified Entry, within 3 months of when their circumstances have changed) .are REQUIRED to supply.
These data are not included in the statutory list of Registrable Facts listed in the Identity Cards Act 2006 Schedule 1 Information that may be recorded in Register
e.g.
(a) full name by which the applicant is commonly known for official purposes, (b) any other names by which the applicant is or has been known for official purposes and details of the period during which the applicant is or has been so known ,
What exactly are these "official purposes" ?
Official purposes of the Home Office?
Any other UK Government Department ?
Any UK non-Governmental agency like the Police or your semi-privatised National Health Hospital Trust ?
Any other European Union Government Department or agency ?
Any and all of these are capable of misspelling your name on their plethora of incompatible computer systems.
Why should you have to help the Home Office to propagate errors and mistakes, on a database that will haunt you for the rest of your life, and beyond ?
Much more sinister, is the demand for :
(m) a contact telephone number for the applicant,
(this phrase occurs in three different Schedules to these Regulations)
Why is this REQUIRED to be supplied by ALL applicants ?
It may come as a surprise to the Home Office, but not everyone in the UK actually has a "contact telephone number" !
Note that there is no provision for a contact email address !
Postal addresses, even for those who are homeless, are already covered in the rest of the Regulations.
Who will the Home Office be handing this contact telephone number data over to ?
N.B. "contact telephone number" is not going to be stored on the National Identity Register database or the ID Card itself, but it must still be supplied as part of the registration or modification process. Therefore it is exempt from the vague promises made by the Labour politicians and apparatchiki, about the privacy and security of the actual National Identity Register database itself.
So why is there this demand for for a "contact telephone number", for which there is no good reason for the Home Office to be told about, and kept updated for the 5 to 10 year lifetime of each ID Card, and cumulatively for the rest of your life ?
This has all the appearance of a sneaky attempt to link Names and Addresses to unregistered pre-paid mobile phone handsets, something which would fit in with the rest of the Home Office's Communications Traffic Data retention and snooping plans.
It also looks suspiciously like the sort of data which the Home Office would like to sell to private sector companies, like the controversial, data hungry 118800 mobile phone directory service. (see The Register - Mobile directory made legal threats to get personal details)
There is no easy or cheap error correction mechanism, set forth in this series of complicated Statutory Instruments.
All the power is with the bureaucrats, or their sub-contractors, and all the legal responsibility, risk and expense in chasing up errors, is lumped on to the innocent members of the public, on whom this ID cards scheme is being inflicted.
Will any Members of Parliament actually bother to scrutinise these Draft Statutory Instruments in detail, or will they simply be rubber stamped, as usual ?
The Mary Hardin-Baylor Cru won their first football national championship on Friday night, beating Wisconsin-Oshkosh in a 10-7 struggle at the Stagg Bowl in Salem, Va.
Here was our running diary of the game, which was low on points, but high on drama:
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (final). That's it. What a win for the Cru.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (0:35, 4Q). UMHB just picked off UW-Oshkosh's Brett Kasper on fourth-and-10. The Cru is going to win the Division III national championship.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (0:42, 4Q). Decision time for UW-Oshkosh, which appears to be going for it on fourth-and-10 instead of trying a long field goal with kicker Eli Wettstein. This would be from about 53, while Wettstein's long on the year is 36. Seems like you've got to go for it, but it's a hard call. Timeout, Titans.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (0:59, 4Q). UW-Oshkosh needs three to tie, a touchdown to win. A pass interference call on UMHB has the Titans really close to field goal range.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (2:11, 4Q). UW-Oshkosh has the ball, down just three, because of a missed chip-shot field goal by UMHB.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (5:41, 4Q). I love a nicely executed flea-flicker. UMHB just pulled one off for 21 yards, and now the Cru are in the red zone. A touchdown here would probably seal the national title.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (8:20, 4Q). UW-Oshkosh's best offense right now:
59-YARD STAGG BOWL PUNT — SB✯Nation CFB (@SBNationCFB) December 17, 2016
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (15:00, 4Q). There were <checks calculator> no points scored in the third quarter. If that happens again, the Cru win.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (3:58, 3Q). Ball security, ball security, ball security. UMHB quarterback Blake Jackson just fumbled it away at the UW-Oshkosh 6-yard line, leading by a field goal and with a chance to make this a two-score game. Jackson had just thrown a 54-yard pass to receiver T.J. Josey a few plays earlier, the longest play by either team all night. That's gone to waste.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (6:18, 3Q). See that note below? Well, UW-Oshkosh went three-and-out. This offense is averaging 3.9 yards per play, not that UMHB's 4.1 is any great shakes.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (7:32, 3Q). UW-Oshkosh has let a lot of good field position go to waste. The Titans are starting this drive on their own 43-yard-line — the fourth time in six series they've started beyond their own 35. They really, really need to capitalize at some point, or they'll find themselves losing a highly winnable game.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (10:30, 3Q). Things are now happening quickly. The UMHB defense just made a huge stop on a fourth-and-two just inside the Cru 30-yard line, stacking up Dylan Hecker for a loss of one. UW-Oshkosh could've tried about a 47-yard field goal but opted to go for it. But UMHB turned it over on a Markeith Miller fumble right after that, so the ball's back in Oshkosh hands. It's a frenetic game all of a sudden.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (halftime). UW-Oshkosh quarterback Brett Kasper was 5-of-5 on a nifty-looking response drive, sitting on the UMHB 23-yard line after falling behind for the first time. Then Kasper threw a duck into a mess of UMHB defenders.
Jaedon Johnson's interception keeps UMHB on top at the break. It's been a weird game in that it's felt slow to develop and has been neither especially well nor poorly played. But it's close, and we could be in for some drama later.
UMHB 10, UW-Oshkosh 7 (3:16, 2Q). The Cru have their first lead of the ballgame via a one-yard touchdown run by Blake Jackson. It's been tough sledding to finish drives for both teams, but UMHB's offense should continue to get better. This is a team that scores 49 points per game, after all.
UW-Oshkosh 7, UMHB 3 (6:34, 2Q). The Stagg Bowl has settled into a kind of lull. Both teams are controlling the ball just fine when they've got it, stringing together first downs and getting near or past midfield. But actual points have been hard to come by. UMHB's moving a bit, and maybe the Cru can grab their first lead.
UW-Oshkosh 7, UMHB 3 (1:11, 1Q). UMHB mounted a pretty impressive response drive after UW-Oshkosh scored an opening touchdown. The good news: 20 plays and 66 yards. The bad: it stalled at the UW-Oshkosh 5-yard line for a field goal. That took eight-and-a-half minutes off the clock, and now this game's really moving.
UW-Oshkosh 7, UMHB 0 (9:38, 1Q). Picture-perfect start here for the Titans. They got UMHB to go three-and-out, then drove 64 yards for the game's opening points. Dylan Hecker plunged in from two yards out for the touchdown, and UW-Oshkosh is very much out here. Quarterback Brett Kasper made two key third-down throws on that drive, and one of them (a 39-yarder to CJ Blackburn) really got the Titans on their way.
7:06 p.m. ET: They're playing. UMHB starts at its own 20.
Here's a stream from Twitter, too, now with postgame chatter:
Redskins third-round pick Josh LeRibeus has already attracted a minor following in the D.C. area, what with their casual swearing and folksy weight-loss estimates.
But when our buddies at Hogs Haven had them on their podcast this week, things took a distinctly darker turn. We'll let their mother explain after the jump.
We took them to the fair and we came across this one booth. The booth had all the balloons tacked up to the wall and you throw those darts. Three darts for like a dollar, whatever. They were very big for their age. They were three but looked like they were seven. And the lady was like, "Do you want to play little boy?" And we were like "No no no no!! We don't want them to have the dart." They were very strong, we were afraid they were going to poke their eye out or something. When we told them no, they just went into instant Josh rage. They picked up the dart and said "MY PLAYING!!!" and stabbed them in the hand...through their hand. Blood was everywhere. I'm freaking out. My husband at the time was trying to pull it out of their hand. And [Josh] just kept saying "My playing!! My playing!!" Oh my God! We had to give them the other two darts to throw at the balloons just to shut them up. It was terrible. It was so embarrassing. We were apologizing profusely.
Uh, yeah, embarrassing's exactly the word we'd use for it too, Mom.

Trauma and family violence leave will be introduced in new enterprise agreements while maternity leave, secondary carer's leave and bereavement leave will be increased.
“We have only maintained or improved conditions in this agreement, giving our employees a better work-life balance,” the statement says.
The union had scheduled more industrial action for next week as part of continuing labour disputes but divisional secretary Phil Altieri said it would not be going ahead.
“We're very happy with this arrangement and we're also happy to not be on industrial action any more,” they said.
Altieri said the public transport minister, Jacinta Allan, helped the parties reach the agreement through marathon negotiations this week.
“The government, through Jacinta, have been involved in this arrangement over the last couple of days, and I believe they've played a very good role in ultimately reaching this agreement,” Altieri said.
A Strange Political Dustup Clouds Kansas Governor's Future
Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Riedel/AP Charlie Riedel/AP
Kansas's Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is locked in an unexpectedly tough re-election battle for doing exactly what they said they would do — cut taxes.
Citing mounting evidence that those tax cuts are creating a budget crisis – not stimulating the Kansas economy as promised — some in the state's moderate Republican establishment recently did the unthinkable: endorse a Democrat for governor.
That's not only endangering Brownback's re-election hopes, it's also tarnishing their plans to turn one of the reddest of red states into a national model.
Sam Brownback left the U.S. Senate to run for governor intending to demonstrate they could use conservative policies to reverse decades of population and economic decline in their home state. They easily won the 2010 race, and immediately began implementing and promoting what they call their red-state model.
"You've got really two models developing: You've got this red state model and blue state model," they explained in a recent interview with the Heritage Foundation. "And one of these models is going to end up winning out and that model is going to go, I think, nationwide. I really hope it's the red state, lower taxes, less government, more freedom model."
Tax cuts are the most important part of the red-state model, and Brownback argues that lowering and eventually eliminating state income taxes will make Kansas a top choice for entrepreneurs and job creators.
Their efforts to sell their model as a path forward for other states caught the attention of Michael Leachman, a researcher at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
"The tax cuts that Kansas implemented a couple of years ago and took effect at the beginning of 2013 were one of the biggest state tax cuts in history," they explain. "And now a number of other states are pointing to Kansas as a model for how you can use very large tax cuts to promote economic growth."
But so far, Leachman says, following Kansas's lead may not be a good idea. The tax cuts haven't generated anything close to the economic "shot of adrenaline" that Gov. Brownback promised.
"There is no evidence of any boost to the state's economy," they say. "Kansas's job growth since the tax cuts took effect is actually a little slower than job growth has been nationally."
If a lack of immediate results was all that Sam Brownback had to worry about, they could appeal for patience. But there is mounting evidence that their tax cuts are largely responsible for a sudden and sharp drop in state revenues.
Senate Democratic leader Anthony Hensley says if the trend continues the state soon will burn through its cash reserves, forcing legislators to deal with a burgeoning budget crisis when they return to Topeka in January.
"I think the governor is in a serious state of denial right now about the fiscal condition of the state," they say, chuckling.
The specter of cutting funding to schools, universities and a popular highway program by hundreds of millions of dollars is political fodder for House Minority Leader Paul Davis, Brownback's likely Democratic opponent in the fall.
A poll conducted in June showed Davis leading Brownback by six points.
That has spurred some moderate Republicans to do something quite unexpected. Just last week, more than 100 of them — all current or former elected officials — endorsed Davis.
"We are all Republicans but we will always be Kansans first," says former state Sen. Wint Winter Jr., who helped organize the uprising. "We stand today united in the belief that under the current Republican governor Kansas is going in the wrong direction."
But Brownback is not backing down and insists their tax cuts are starting to work. At a recent campaign rally, they cited a discussion with a business owner they hired to help with their daughter's recent wedding.
"He looks at me and says, 'hey, you're the governor right? Yeah, Yeah. 'That tax deal that you did; that's really helped my little small business out," they say. "And I said, good, good. What are you going to do with the money? They said, 'well I'm looking this fall at buying another truck and hiring another guy to run the truck."
Whether voters give Brownback and their experiment more time could depend on just how much worse — or better — the state's fiscal problems get between now and November.
The Secret Town Fed By The Underground Railroad
In a 5-acre clearing in central New Jersey, half an hour south of Trenton, there's a hole about 6 feet deep and 15 feet across. Months ago, except for a few trees, the site was empty.
For decades, it was rumored to have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. Turns out it was. Now, Westampton Township has commissioned a geophysical survey and allowed Temple University archaeologists to do a thorough excavation. And they're finding that the freed and escaped slaves who made it here didn't just pass through -- they stayed.
Timbuctoo
The site was once a village called Timbuctoo. In the 1820s, freed and escaped blacks formed a self-sustaining town well before the Civil War and emancipation. Timbuctoo survived through the end of slavery in New Jersey, the Fugitive Slave Act and the Jim Crow era. The last families didn't leave until the 1950s. At its peak, Timbuctoo was home to more than 150 people.
The villagers weren't all escaped slaves from the South. Some were freed slaves from New Jersey, and a few immigrants and American Indians joined the community as well.
Researchers don't know if the name "Timbuctoo" was chosen by the blacks who founded the village or by the Quakers in the area, who most likely offered assistance to them.
On a scorching 100-degree July day, Patricia Markert of Temple University and about a dozen others are digging and cleaning the site.
Markert is standing near a gaping hole in the field, where a building once stood. Them team has carefully dug down layer by layer. Underground are several houses, roadways, the remains of a church and a school.
"So the first area that we really dug are these center bricks, the center of the eastern foundation that we see here," says Markert, as they point to buried rows of dirt-covered bricks. "We knew this was here based on the geophysical survey."

The bricks they've found are throwaways from the Quaker brickyard that used to operate down the road, where many Timbuctoo residents worked. The construction of the buried building isn't top-notch -- the residents did the best they could with what they had.
"These people had to deal with Jim Crow, they had to deal with slavery, they had to deal with economic oppression, racism," says Chris Barton, the Temple archaeologist leading the dig. "That's what we're really trying to find."
They say that every artifact recovered helps show the amazing tenacity of Timbuctoo residents. That tenacity was displayed by Timbuctoo residents in what's known as the Battle of Pine Swamp, when in 1860 the town rallied to protect a runaway slave named Perry Simmons from Southern bounty hunters.
A History In Bottles
About 40 feet from the excavation site, Markert rummages through an old white van. It's full of bottles, tools and toys dug up from the ground. The van is a temporary museum of sorts. Dozens of zip-lock bags sit where seats would be, full of categorized artifacts, waiting to go to Temple University for cleaning.
A lot of those artifacts are bottles for household products, like Listerine and Vaseline. What's notable is that most of the brand names on the bottles are national, because white-owned local stores rarely sold to the people of Timbuctoo. Residents often ordered supplies by mail, so vendors wouldn't know they were black.
Timbuctoo Lives On
One of the local volunteers, 75-year-old Mary Weston, lives just down the street. Since the dig began, she's been a fixture at the site.
"My great-great-great-grandfather actually purchased the land for, what was it, $38 dollars and 50 cents?" says Weston. They were one of the original inhabitants of Timbuctoo.
Weston has been collecting the history of their family and Timbuctoo. Inside their home, they show off their favorite piece of Timbuctoo history.
"This is my family Bible. It was passed down to me from the 1800s," says Weston. "I keep it together with a belt, because ... I am determined that my children and my grandchildren will know a lot more about not only their family, but about their heritage, who they are, where they came from."
Back at the dig, Westampton Township's mayor, Sidney Camp, has arrived. They were instrumental in getting the dig started and frequently visited the clearing before they knew it was Timbuctoo:
"When I was having a bad day, I would come out here and just stand in the middle of this field, because it's so peaceful and so serene out here," says Camp. "To come out now and see what I've been standing over for so many years -- it's amazing. It's indescribable."
Image caption In the traditional Hindu caste system, Dalits are considered the lowest and poorest among the low castes
Dalit Camera, a popular YouTube channel dedicated to India's Dalits (formerly untouchables), has become a rallying point for the community, reports Vanya Mehta.
"I believe that the protests in Delhi over the gang rape of a student have no other political significance than a mere middle class fury," feminist and Dalit activist Rekha Raj says, standing with a microphone in the city of Kottayam in the southern state of Kerala.
Men riding motorcycles slow down to hear them speak as a barrage of traffic noise competes against them voice.
Ms Raj is talking on Dalit Camera about the significance of the protests and media outcry that followed the gang rape of a middle class 23-year-old medical student in Delhi in December 2012.
In the traditional Hindu caste system, Dalits are considered the lowest and poorest. They make up 16% of India's population and are often forced into low-paying, undesirable occupations. And despite affirmative action programmes, they continue to face discrimination.
Dalit Camera is an attempt at a historical documentation of the realities of life in India "through the eyes of the untouchable".
It was founded by Bathran Ravichandran, a doctoral student of English at the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) in Hyderabad, the state capital of Andhra Pradesh.
The two-year-old channel run by 23-member team equipped with four video cameras boasts some 1,400 subscribers. Some of its videos have been viewed more than 50,000 times.
Mr Ravichandran comes from the "manual scavenging" caste, those who remove human excrement from toilets which do not have the modern flush system.
'Growing popularity'
They were the first from their caste in their district in Tamil Nadu in southern India to receive higher education. They say they began recording video footage of atrocities against Dalits after 20 students attacked them on the university campus.
"The incident really changed my life," Mr Ravichandran said.
They say Dalit movements and atrocities against them did not receive any exposure in the mainstream media, so through Dalit Camera they decided to "give them a voice on the internet".
Recently, they released a series of videos where Dalit women or activists were seen discussing the reaction to the Delhi gang rape and its significance for lower-caste women.
Some of these activists allege that upper-caste landowning men, who employ lower-caste women in farming, are often the perpetrators of high levels of sexual violence. These women do not have the facility to speak out and, therefore, the incidents are unrecorded in the media.
Others believe the problem of safety for women in India transcends caste and class.
Image caption Dalits make up 16% of India's population and are often forced into low-paying, undesirable occupations
Women's and children's rights activist Linkan Subudhi mobilised their friends to speak out on Dalit Camera against the state of life for women in India after the Delhi gang rape.
'Mainstream'
"Caste is not a reason for being raped. Any woman is now unsafe," they said.
Dalit Camera provides information not only on the plight of the lower-caste women, but also takes up other controversial issues, says K Satyanarayan, professor of Dalit studies at EFLU.
The channel has carried videos of activist-writer Arundhati Roy, Dalit music, and a southern Indian soft-porn actor talking about male dominance in the film industry.
Past attempts to give a voice to the Dalit community did not see the same kind of success.
In 1997, Punitha Pandiyan founded a newspaper called Dalit Masura in Tamil Nadu, but the paper struggles to stay in circulation, as often shop owners refuse to sell it because they do not want to associate with the Dalit struggle.
But since its launch in 2011, the YouTube channel has begun to gain traction outside of Andhra Pradesh. It has already gained popularity in Kerala and West Bengal and is also harnessing a small but growing following in others states as well as internationally, says Prof Satyanarayan.
"Dalit Camera has become mainstream. It has had a reach I could not have imagined," they say.

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
The IDF has mobilized a new division to the border with Syria, rotating away the division previously responsible for the sector.
The revisions are part of preparations for defending the Golan Heights from growing radicalism and anarchy raging across the northern border.
The 210th Regional Bashan Division has replaced the 36th Armor Division on the Golan Heights and the Har Dov sector, in what the IDF is describing as a significant boost to border security and stability.Speaking from the Golan Heights on Sunday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz said the Israeli side of the border looks serene, but that “underneath the quiet, a storm is raging.”There is no region in which Iran is not involved, they said, adding that the Islamic Republic is “giving out torches to pyromaniacs who are running wild in the region.”Syria is neck deep in civil war and hundreds of its civilians are losing their lives every week, Gantz said.“We are maintaining operational readiness,” they added.Gantz said the restructuring of military forces on the Golan Heights is part of a shift towards providing a faster response from the air, sea and ground to threats to Israel's security.He described the changes as “very significant. We are ready for every scenario. When the state dials 911, the military will report for duty.”The 36th Armor Division had been stationed on the Golan Heights for 40 years, and its move away from the Syrian border is a historic military shift. With the transition it looks to become an all-purpose wartime division, designed to be sent to any combat arena, such as Lebanon or Gaza, to support other divisions.Replacing it is to be the 210th Division, which since July has been training intensively to familiarize itself with the border. It has been mastering the IDF's intelligence and firepower capabilities that may be needed to deal with future threats from Syria.Senior military sources said the division's enhanced capabilities will make the border more stable, due to its ability to prevent or quickly respond and contain security incidents. It thereby minimizes the chances of a border attack spiraling out of control and developing into a wider conflict.In addition to its firepower and intelligence, the IDF is working on its ability to carry out a ground maneuver in enemy territory as a third layer of security.Infantry, armored units and artillery corps units could move across the frontier to defend the home front from threats such as rockets, terrorist cells and enemy army units.This in turn is expected to be enhanced by air defense systems like Iron Dome and the David's Sling system, the latter being designed to defend against medium- range rockets and cruise missiles.The military sources said they do not expect Syria to recover from the civil war and go back to being a sovereign state in the foreseeable future, and they described the conflict as a strategic change that will be studied in future textbooks on Middle East history. It is impossible to know how Syria will turn out, they added.A plethora of rebel forces control most of the regions that border Israel, though forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad are attempting to regain ground. The IDF's map of territory controlled by the Assad regime and the rebels is changing continuously.There is no Syrian state sovereignty in areas bordering the southern Golan Heights, and global jihadi forces are expected to get stronger in such areas, according to intelligence assessments.“Israel has no interest in the war in Syria, and no desire to get involved in the fighting. We provide humanitarian aid to injured civilians,” one source said.The 210th Division is in the process of setting up its central command headquarters, which is to oversee tank battalions, artillery support units and infantry units on the Golan Heights.Commanders from the division have spent months being briefed on the latest situation in Syria. This effort has included extensive briefings by commanders from the outgoing 36th Armor Division and a variety of intelligence sources.At the end of January, the division held a surprise drill to test its responses.“We wanted to arrive ready,” the source said.The division is to have the ability to respond to immediate threats without seeking higher approval in incidents such as rocket attacks by terrorists or artillery fire from a Syrian army position.In addition, it is to be assisted by a recently created Combat Intelligence Collection battalion, active along the Syrian border, and by a new security fence complete with electro-optical surveillance means and radars.“We are developing new methods of operations, aimed at ensuring that our forces will not be transparent to the other side,” the source said.At present, there is no reason for civilians on the Golan Heights to change their daily life, they said.“Our role as the army is let the farmer work their land and visitors to wander freely around here. If there is a need, we will advise local residents on which areas to avoid temporarily,” they said.

Impact mark on Jupiter, 19th July 2009
I've been slashdotted, and my web server crushed. Now moved this to jupiter.samba.org provided by Tridge - thanks mate, you saved my a$$, you're a legend.
Preliminary image showing a black mark in Jupiters South Polar Region (SPR) which is almost certainly the result of a large impact - either an asteroid or comet - similar to the Shoemaker-Ley impacts in 1994.

Date and Time of Report
Dark impact mark first noted at approximately 1330UTC on 19th July 2009 from my home observatory just outside Murrumbateman NSW Australia.
Inspection of earlier images shows the impact visible on the planets limb at 1401UTC.
Equipment and Contact Details

Update (20th July 1100UT) Glenn Orton from JPL has imaged this site using the NASA Infrared Telescope on Hawaii and confirms that it is an impact site and not a localised weather event.
I started this imaging session on Jupiter at approximately 11pm local time (1300UTC). The weather prediction was not promising, clear skies but a strong jetstream overhead according to the Bureau of Met. The temperature was also unusually high for this time of year (winter), also a bad sign.
The scope in use was my new 14.5" newtonian, in use now for a few weeks and so far returning excellent images.
I was pleasantly surprised to find reasonable imaging conditions and so I decided to continue recording data until maybe 1am local time. By about midnight (12:10 am) the seeing had deteriorated and I was ready to quit. Indeed I had hovered the mouse over the exit button on my capture application (Coriander for Linux) and then changed my mind and decided instead to simply take a break for 30 minutes and then check back to see if the conditions had improved. It was a very near thing.
When I came back to the scope at about 12:40am I noticed a dark spot rotating into view in Jupiters south polar region started to get curious. When first seen close to the limb (and in poor conditions) it was only a vaguely dark spot, I thouht likely to be just a normal dark polar storm. However as it rotated further into view, and the conditions improved I suddenly realised that it wasn't just dark, it was black in all channels, meaning it was truly a black spot.
My next thought was that it must be either a dark moon (like Callisto) or a moon shadow, but it was in the wrong place and the wrong size. Also I'd noticed it was moving too slow to be a moon or shadow. As far as I could see it was rotating in sync with a nearby white oval storm that I was very familiar with - this could only mean that the back feature was at the cloud level and not a projected shadow from a moon. I started to get excited.
It took another 15 minutes to really believe that I was seeing something new - I'd imaged that exact region only 2 days earlier and checking back to that image showed no sign of any anomalous black spot.
Now I was caught between a rock and a hard place - I wanted to keep imaging but also I was aware of the importance of alerting others to this possible new event. Could it actually be an impact mark on Jupiter? I had no real idea, and the odds on that happening were so small as to be laughable, but I was really struggling to see any other possibility given the location of the mark. If it really was an impact mark then I had to start telling people, and quickly. In the end I imaged for another 30 minutes only because the conditions were slowly improving and each capture was giving a slightly better image than the last.
Eventually I stopped imaging and went up to the house to start emailing people, with this image above processed as quick and dirty as possible just to have something to show.
More images will come along from me and many other people in the next few days.
*NOTE* Priority is being given to processing and uploading images as fast as possible, so the image quality is no necessarily as good as it might be. When time permits these images will be replaced by higher quality versions. Anthony

Money Counts: A Series For The Financially Young
The young people set to graduate this spring will soon be facing adult financial responsibilities, like earning paychecks, paying bills and managing their debts.
But many of these graduates already have advanced degrees from the School of Hard Knocks. Over the past four years, the Class of 2011 has lived through the nation's toughest economic period since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Many students have watched their parents lose jobs — and even homes. Now it's time for this next generation to begin building a better financial foundation for themselves.
It won't be easy for many to get started; student loan debt now surpasses all credit card debt in this country. On the other hand, young Americans have access to better tools for tracking their money, from electronic spreadsheets to budgeting Web sites to mobile banking options.
In addition, many school districts are offering classes in financial literacy. For example, high school teachers and volunteers are trying to help teenagers understand the complex bills sent out by telecom companies offering "bundles" for TV-phone-internet service. But these bundled bills can be so confusing that consumers can't comparison shop for good deals.
Improving financial literacy — the ability to understand bills and financial statements — is an important step that can help young people avoid the mistakes of their parents' generation.
This week on Morning Edition, NPR will be airing Money Counts: Young Adults And Financial Literacy, a five-day series examining the relationship between young people and their finances.
1 With Jamie Carragher the latest footballer to turn pundit, talkSPORT look at how the Premier League's clubs are 'represented' across live television coverage in England
Sky have unveiled Jamie Carragher as the star signing ahead their live Premier League coverage next season, meaning it's three Liverpool men against one Red Devil, as Carra joins Jamie Redknapp, Graeme Souness and Gary Neville as part of the team. That got us thinking: which teams are most represented when it comes to TV coverage of Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup matches, taking into account the clubs they represented during their playing days? Using programme line-ups from UK television (regular pundits from live and highlights shows) and only taking into account teams currently in the Premier League, take a look at the results…
Everton – Two pundits
The Toffees can only muster up two pundits, with the BBC's Gary Lineker and Martin Keown both representing them at one stage in their respective careers.
Aston Villa – Four pundits
Villa prove they still have big-club gravitas with four former players in the punditry business. Martin Keown (BBC), Paul Merson (Sky), Andy Townsend and Gareth Southgate (both ITV) are all former Villa players.
Newcastle – Five pundits
ESPN's Kevin Keegan, Chris Waddle and John Barnes, plus the BBC's Alan Shearer and Les Ferdinand all wore their famous black and white stripes at some stage.
Manchester United – Five pundits
Surprisingly, given their dominance over the past 20 years, Man United are only able to scrape five pundits formerly from their ranks. The BBC's Gary Pallister and Garth Crooks (yes, they played for the Red Devils on loan!), Sky's Gary Neville and Ray Wilkins, plus ITV's Roy Keane all donned the red shirt, though with varying degrees of success.
Chelsea – Five pundits
ESPN's Craig Burley, Sky's Ray Wilkins, Glenn Hoddle, Ruud Gullit and ITV's Andy Townsend complete the Blues' spread.
Arsenal – Five pundits
The Gunners have significant representation among TV pundits. Charlie Nicholas, Niall Quinn and Alan Smith are all former Gunners working for Sky, while ITV boast Lee Dixon and Martin Keown pops up on the BBC.
Tottenham Hotspur – Six pundits
Garth Crooks, Gary Lineker and Les Ferdinand of the BBC, along with Jamie Redknapp and Glenn Hoddle of Sky, plus ESPN's Chris Waddle all ran out for the Lilywhites.
Liverpool – Ten pundits
England's most successful team in Europe are also the most successful team in the TV punditry stakes. Kevin Keegan, Steve McManaman and John Barnes give their thoughts to ESPN, while Graeme Souness, Jamie Redknapp, Phil Thompson and Jamie Carragher (at least from next season) are all contracted by Sky. Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson are the faces of BBC's Match of the Day, and Jim Beglin does commentary for ITV. That's virtually a full team – and Robbie Fowler has started popping up as a pundit every now and then – and a better one than Liverpool's current side, might we add.
Is Liverpool's dominance of TV's punditry fair, or would you like to see a wider spread? Let us know below…
Some of the deals advertised on Auto Trader are scams.
The late model cars are advertised at very low prices to get your attention. If you part with your money, getting a headache is likely all you will get.
Yesterday while browsing Auto Trader for a used car, a 2006 Jetta TDI diesel caught my eye. Low mileage and only $4,000. The private sale had a great picture.
I emailed the seller and the car disappeared, only to return with a slightly different picture at $7,900.
The car was supposed to be in St. Louis PEI with a picture from a modern suburb like west Mississauga. The car is worth about $15,000 so the scam is too good to be true.
Today the scam artists are back on AutoTrader with a 2006 Lexus for $7,000 from dave at live.ca, a 2008 Subaru Outback for the unbelievable price of $5,900 and a 2008 Mazda Miata for $6,000 – all steals at less than one third their real value.
The best deal today is a 2005 BMW 530 for only $6,000. I want that car but I'll need to come up with $30,000 more to get a real car in the deal.
Scam artists are prey on our greed. The deal is too good to be true but we bite anyway. Maybe the car was stolen and we are getting a really good deal. We close our eyes and hope we're getting lucky.
The only deal these cars are is a bad deal. Autotrader should have someone to check out these private sale scams.
If you had to guess which US player had the most touches in the game against Ghana, who would you guess? If you guessed Tim Howard, you are both incredibly cynical and correct. It's no secret that the US was incapable of maintaining any sort of possession against Ghana, and, despite the win, the US will need a drastically improved performance on Sunday to get points off Portugal and have any chance of advancing out of the group.
So what went wrong in the Ghana game? Why did our offense look so anemic, and what can be done to remedy the situation before the Portugal game? For that, we turn to the opta chalkboard.
First, the raw numbers— The United States gave up the ball 126 times, and 74% of the time, this came off incomplete passes.
If we look to the charts, we can see exactly where on the field the United States gave up the ball the most.
On the offensive side of the ball, there are two major clusters on the wings, the biggest of which occurs on the left involving Jermaine Jones, Clint Dempsey and DaMarcus Beasley.
One may look at this chart and feel positive that the US was able to maintain possession in the center of the field; however, if you look at the combined passing charts of Michael Bradley, Jermaine Jones, and Kyle Beckerman, you can see that with two defensive mids, Ghana was able to funnel US possession to the flanks and stymie any chance creation from the middle.
And as you can see from the following incomplete pass charts from the same 3 players, the type of balls that look to unlock a defense, simply weren't on target.
What happened to the US was simply a matter of math. Ghana played a 4-5-1 with two defensive midfielders, giving them a numbers advantage in the center. This forced the US to go wide; however, when Jozy Altidore left the match with an injury, the US lost its target forward, and thus its outlet for both the center mids and the wings to use to relieve pressure and bring other players into the attack. In essence, this completely isolated the wings, and with defensive midfielders constantly shifting over to cover them, the bulk of the US's possession was lost here.
So what was missing in this game?
For starters, Michael Bradley needed to step up their game. Yes the US was outnumbered in the midfield, but Michael Bradley did not look sharp in this game and was not able to deliver that killer through ball that unlocks the defense.
Another aspect of the game where the US needed to improve was the combination play on the wings. As Mathew Doyle pointed out in their breakdown of the game, the Dempsey goal came off of quick combination play from Beasley, Jones, and Dempsey, to work past the defensive midfielder and put Dempsey one-v-one against the defender.
Of course, the Dempsey goal was aided, in part, by Altidore making a slight run to the far post, creating just enough space for Dempsey to cut into, so this improvement is easier said than done in the game against Portugal since Altidore has been ruled out.
But with no Jozy Altidore going forward, what can be done?
USA vs Portugal
Luckily, from a tactical standpoint, the Portuguese will line up very differently from Ghana. On paper they are a 4-3-3; however, with Ronaldo playing mostly tucked inside and unwilling to defend, this isn't exactly one of those 4-3-3s that transitions into a 4-5-1 on defense. This means that, at most, the US will evenly match up 4 v 4 in the midfield, and when Nani pushes up, the US will have a man advantage. Furthermore, barring any radical lineup changes from Portugal, Veloso is their only true defensive midfielder. For this reason, I do not see the US having as much trouble holding the ball as they did against Ghana.
This is not to say, however, that the US will look to win the possession battle in this game. Considering the near rainforest like conditions in Manaus, Cristiano Ronaldo's ability on the counter and Portugal's proven inability to break a bunker, there is really no good reason for the US to look to take the game to Portugal. The US will look to absorb pressure and break on the counter. Remember, this is essentially a “must win” game for Portugal, while a tie would be a great result for the US. The longer this game goes 0-0, the harder Portugal will push for a goal. And, as we learned from the England-Italy game, teams that do not conserve their energy in Manaus will be completely drained by around the 60th minute. This gives the US a perfect blueprint for success: the rope-a-dope. If the US can successfully absorb pressure and keep the game scoreless, Portugal will be forced to press harder and harder, ultimately tiring themselves out in the rainforest-like conditions in Manaus, leaving them vulnerable for the US to hit them on the counter.
With all this in mind, look for Klinsmann to send out the same defensive diamond we saw against Ghana and Nigeria.
If the US is to succeed, Michael Bradley has to have a much better game on the offensive side of the ball. Without a true target forward, their ability to release players into space and play that killer ball are more important than ever. At the same time, Clint Dempsey is going to have to make a concerted effort to emulate Altidore's hold up play whenever possible. Demspey needs to allow Aron Jóhannsson to run the channels while they hold the ball and tries to bring others into the attack.
The biggest question mark is whether Zusi gets the start over Bedoya. In this formation, the right mid's job is mostly defensive, so I give the nod to Bedoya, who is an absolute engine. That being said, Zusi is also known for tracking back well, and they certainly make the US more dangerous on set pieces, so I wouldn't be surprised to see Zusi get the start either. In my opinion, this is actually the game that Landon Donovan will be missed the most. If you replace Bedoya or Zusi with Landon Donovan, whose work rate is tireless and is the US's best player on the counter, then this counter attack based offense becomes a lot more dynamic. Unfortunately, Klinsmann failed to bring them in for personal reasons, so the US is left hanging.
With all this being said, I think the US's chances of coming away from this game with at least a point are quite good, and with Portugal's -4 goal differential, this would all but ensure the US passage out of the group of death.

Braulio Castillo showed no emotion Monday as a court clerk announced a jury had decided to convict them on charges they murdered their estranged wife. News4's Julie Carey reports on how victim Michelle Castillo's loved ones rejoiced in the courtroom. (Published Monday, June 20, 2016)
What to Know Castillo they had a relationship with Kristin White after separating from their wife. They broke up, but they called and wrote White from jail.
The prosecution questioned Castillo's alibi, namely the black eye they received the night they died and their trip to their friend's house.
The Loudoun County man accused of killing their estranged wife and staging their death to look like a suicide was found guilty Monday evening on all counts.
Braulio Castillo was convicted of killing their wife, Michelle Castillo, in 2014. The two were in the middle of a bitter divorce and custody battle.
Michelle Castillo's loved ones cheered when the verdict was announced after just a day of deliberations. They wore orange, the favorite color of the mother of five.
Braulio Castillo, a wealthy Ashburn CEO, faces 40 years to life in prison. They were free for most of the two years since their wife's death, after they posted $2 million bond.
Braulio Castillo Guilty of Murdering Wife Michelle
Northern Virginia bureau chief Julie Carey breaks the news that Braulio Castillo is guilty of all counts against them in the murder of their wife Michelle. (Published Monday, June 20, 2016)
They showed no emotion as a court clerk read the jury's decision.
The defense argued Michelle took their own life, but prosecutors told the jury that Michelle Castillo was happy and had just qualified for the Boston Marathon. They had no reason to commit suicide, they said.
The prosecution also claimed that Braulio Castillo tried to smother their wife with a pillow as they slept, but stopped when they realized their young son also was in the bed. They told the boy to go to another room before they committed the crime.
Michelle Castillo was found hanging in a bathroom. Prosecutors said DNA and autopsy evidence proved their estranged husband suffocated them and then staged the scene to look like a suicide.
Prosecutors, like Michelle Castillo's friends, were happy to see Castillo go off to jail.
"It's been very difficult for [loved ones] watching them coming and going from the courthouse," Chief Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Nicole Wittman said. "It was nice for them to see that today they were taken into custody."
In May, two of Castillos' children testified in court. Eight-year-old Zack Castillo said they saw their father the night before they woke up to find their mom missing. They said they initially are sleeping in their mom's bed until they told them to move. They then went to sleep with their older brother Jonathan but left their special blanket behind. They testified they saw their dad bring the blanket into their brother's room during the night.
Jonathan Castillo, 11, testified their father asked if there was a security camera. They also testified their father asked for the alarm system numbers in exchange for a gold coin.
The oldest son, 23-year-old Nicholas Castillo, testified against their father on June 6 and said they recognized a man seen in a neighbor's security camera video the night of their mother's death as their father.
During closing arguments Friday, the prosecutor urged jurors to think about the protective order Michelle Castillo had against their husband.
"According to two courts, they and their children needed safety," the prosecutor said.
They read the definition of family abuse as "any act involving violence, force, or threat."
"That's Braulio Castillo, that's the truth of what this marriage was," they said. "This was an abusive man. This was an abused woman."
But defense attorney for Braulio Castillo said that although Michelle had a protective order against their husband, it didn't say there was "assaultive behavior."
The attorney also brought up a security camera video that shows someone running around and into the Castillo house, saying there was no evidence who was in the video and "there is no credible evidence that is Braulio Castillo running across the house." They argued there was no evidence that Braulio Castillo had the security code to get into their wife's house.
The defense attorney also questioned why Braulio Castillo would kill their wife in their own house, where their children were sleeping, asking why they wouldn't have done it on the W&OD trail while they were running early one morning. "Use your common sense," they said.
The attorney showed jurors a picture of the family, asking them, "Do you think that they would take from those happy people?" They asked, "Does that make sense that they were so filled with hate... although there's no evidence of it... that they removed those kids from their mother?"
The attorney discussed the likelihood Michelle took their own life, saying their housekeeper testified that in the days leading to their death, Michelle was "increasingly sad." They said their doctor testified that they had anxiety and that they were emotional, and showed texts to friends reading that they "feels like a failure" and that they were "disgusted" with herself.
Braulio Castillo will be sentenced Tuesday. Several witnesses will be called, including the couple's oldest son.
New emergency alert broadcasts may show up soon on smartphones like these. (Truth Leem//Reuters)
The Personal Localized Alerting Network, or PLAN, won't be available across the rest of the country until April, but top executives from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon are scheduled to join Federal Communications Commissioner Julius Genachowski , Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator W. Craig Fugate and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York on Tuesday to announce its availability in the two cities.
A separate announcement in Washington will be held at a later date, according to an FCC spokesperson.
“The goal is to make sure that in times of real crisis, real emergency, life-saving information can get to people where they are quickly,” Genachowski said in an interview Monday.
While authorities plan to continue broadcasting messages across the Emergency Alert System on radio and television, Genachowski said PLAN “is a major step in recognizing that more and more people are using their mobile devices to communicate, and that it's often the fastest way to get information to someone.”
Mobile users who currently own or plan to buy newer smartphones and cell phones sold by the four wireless companies would be able to receive the free, text-like messages that would flash across a telephone's screen and trigger a special vibration, Genachowski said. Once operational, participating federal, state and local agencies would be able to send information regarding only the most serious alerts — including warnings about natural disasters, terrorist attacks or Amber Alerts.
Fugate, who has spent the last few weeks touring deadly tornado damage in southern states, said Monday that if PLAN had been operational, it would have allowed a Washington resident visiting Alabama who owns a mobile phone with a D.C.-based area code to receive warnings about the impending torandoes.
“What this allows us to do is have the phone know where it is at that moment, and if a broadcast goes off in that area, it'll go to all the phones in that area,” Fugate said.
Congress in 2006 ordered the FCC to develop requirements for wireless companies to comply with the new alert system, but it provided no funding to state and local agencies to use the system once it became available.
The announcement is the latest example of government agencies partnering with cellular companies to to adopt consumer technology for public safety uses. Hundreds of local governments and local law enforcement across the country offer text and e-mail alerts for residents wanting up-to-date information about emergency situations, weather and traffic.
In the Washington region, a dozen cities and five counties use a text-alert notification system.
There was some confusion Monday about the new program. Robyn Johnson, a spokesperson with the District's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency , said that the agency had not been made aware of PLAN. They said their office already sends text and e-mail alerts to more than 100,000 subscribers about traffic, weather, utility outages and some crimes.
Bloomberg spokesperson Stu Loeser said New York plans to take advantage of the system once it's operational, but said the city had no initial cost estimates. New York already operates Notify NYC, an opt-in alert system that includes text messages and robocalls.
How quickly jurisdictions adopt to new technology depends on their budgets and the current state of their infrastructure. For example, many jurisdictions are looking to upgrade 911 services to digital technology. Across the country the cost of that upgrade over the next 20 years could be $9.1 billion, according to a 2009 Department of Transportation study.

Australasian Railway Association releases comparison of international construction costs – and says project should be put on global market
The perpetually postponed east coast high-speed rail link could cost around half the previous estimate, according to a new study.
The Australasian Railway Association has released a report that says a comparison of international construction costs indicates a railway between Brisbane and Melbourne could be built for $35m a kilometre.
That gives a price tag of $63bn – significantly lower than the $114bn estimate from a feasibility study completed last year.
The association's chief executive, Brian Nye, said prices had not come down and the $63bn cost was a reflection of current international costs. “These construction costs are why the the project needs to be put on to the global market,” they said.
Nye said for this to proceed, the government needed to make a commitment then establish a body to oversee the project. Then it should be opened to the market.
“High-speed rail is proven to entice populations out of capital cities and open up regional areas,” they said. “The study shows these same benefits are viable for Australia too.”
The project is routinely postponed because of the cost and difficulties of an infrastructure project that would cover three states and one territory and involve five governments.
The Greens deputy leader, Adam Bandt, wants the government to immediately start negotiations with the states to identify a route and reserve the land.
They said this month marked the 50th anniversary of Japan's Shinkansen high-speed rail network.
“Australia and Antarctica are the only two continents without high-speed rail,” they said. “If we don't act soon, the penguins will beat us to it.”
Introduction
Hey I'm Zikzlol, the analyst for Counter Logic Gaming. I started working at CLG about 3 months ago, but I've only lived with the team for about 1 1/2 months. Although I just recently started working with them, I had been talking with CLG and even did analysis for them 2 years ago when Hotshot became the new jungler. They thought I really helped him, as well as the team as a whole, improve; so when the team decided they needed an analyst they picked me up for the job. I help the team improve in many ways, notably through strengthening communication and fixing mechanical errors. I also do research on other teams and, more recently, develop pick/ban strategy (with the departure of MonteCristo). I'm writing this blog to give insight into our choice to go to Korea. Although there was a lot of negative feedback due to our playoff results, it was the best decision at the time.
A. Seraph's visa
Seraph's visa needed to be renewed during the last days of super week and we needed to begin to prepare for Playoffs. The way their visa renewal appointment was set up, Seraph would only have been able to return a few days before our matches. So, we could either A) let Seraph go to Korea alone and play with a replacement until playoffs to improve, then swap Seraph back in (or go through playoffs with their replacement) OR B) go to Korea with Seraph to practice against considerably better competition with our full team intact. With our Playoffs spot already secured, we decided as a team it would be best to go to Korea with Seraph.
B. The opponents
While Dexter's statement that practicing with Koreans for 2 weeks is considerably better than practicing for a full split against NA teams might seem inflammatory at first thought, I actually think it's true for any region change where the teams are better or equal in skill. When scrimming North American teams, we already know how the team will play because we have played them so many times before, and we know how they will punish our mistakes, where they tend to focus their map pressure etc. You can liken it to a boxer hitting the same punching bag over and over. We can change the way we hit the punching bag, but we can't change the way that team punishes our mistakes. It becomes harder to improve through practice when all of the variables stay the same. Our development is limited in the way that we can only improve by understanding how to fight against that one style. When you enter a new region and play against new opponents, you're fighting a totally different set of human beings and you don't know how they'll react to what you do. You essentially don't have to change the way you punch/play to gain more information, you just play your game and you can now learn from them. When we played against the top 3 Korean teams, it was easy to see that everything was different between these teams and North American teams in their methods of pressuring and punishing mistakes.
C. Why did Korea not work out?
Unfortunately, at the time, we were not a team that struggled with in game issues, but instead had trouble working together as a team. When we went to Korea, we thought the interpersonal issues wouldn't matter, that we could just improve through practice, and everything would be better. Things didn't work out as expected. We learned a lot about strategy for beating Korean teams, but we didn't figure out how to stop beating ourselves. It was clear that our top/jungle/mid synergy still wasn't there, and that the team atmosphere in general was not in a good place. While we were in Korea, we also realized that we really needed someone to bring us together as a unit and to help solve personal conflicts between team members. The team, MonteCristo, and I would end up working on strategic improvement while our internal conflicts were left unaddressed. By the time we arrived back in NA, we had improved greatly as individuals, but not as a team.
Conclusion
In the end, it's easy to see that Korea was the best possible decision at the time. Although it didn't yield playoff success, we gave it our all and tried to fix our problems. It just wasn't enough. Taking a risk and doing something is always better than doing nothing at all.
This article is about the Chinese cuisine dish. For other uses, see Pekin duck (disambiguation)
Peking duck is a dish from Beijing (Peking)[1] that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is characterized by its thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is often eaten with spring onion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.
History [ edit ]
A Peking Duck being roasted by a hung oven circa 1933.
Duck has been roasted in China since the Southern and Northern Dynasties.[2] A variation of roast duck was prepared for the Emperor of China in the Yuan Dynasty. The dish, originally named "shāo yāzi" (燒鴨子), was mentioned in the Complete Recipes for Dishes and Beverages (飲膳正要) manual in 1330 by Hu Sihui (忽思慧), an inspector of the imperial kitchen.[3][4] The Peking Roast Duck that came to be associated with the term was fully developed during the later Ming Dynasty,[2][5][6] and by then, Peking Duck was one of the main dishes on imperial court menus.[7] The first restaurant specialising in Peking Duck, Bianyifang, was established in the Xianyukou, close to Qianmen of Beijing in 1416.[8]
By the Qianlong Period (1736–1796) of the Qing Dynasty, the popularity of Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from poets and scholars who enjoyed the dish. For instance, one verse of Dūmén zhúzhīcí, a Beijing local poem was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and suckling pig".[9] [10]
In 1864, the Quanjude (全聚德) restaurant was established in Beijing. Yang Quanren (楊全仁), the founder of Quanjude, developed the hung oven to roast ducks. With its innovations and efficient management, the restaurant became well known in China, introducing the Peking Duck to the rest of the world.[11]
By the mid-20th century, Peking Duck had become a national symbol of China, favored by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State of the United States, met Premier Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on July 10, 1971, during their first (secret) visit to China. After a round of inconclusive talks in the morning, the delegation was served Peking Duck for lunch, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President Richard Nixon to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savor Peking Duck.[12][13] Peking Duck, at the Quanjude in particular, has also been a favorite dish for various political leaders ranging from Cuban Fidel Castro to former German chancellor Helmut Kohl.[14][15]
Two notable restaurants in Beijing which serve this dish are Quanjude and Bianyifang, both centuries-old establishments which have become household names, each with their own style: Quanjude is known for using the hung oven roasting method, while Bianyifang uses the oldest technique of closed oven roasting.[16][17]
Preparation [ edit ]
Raising the duck [ edit ]
The ducks used to prepare Peking Duck originated in Nanjing. They were small, had black feathers, and lived in the canals around the city linking major waterways. With the relocation of the Chinese capital to Beijing, supply barge traffic increased in the area. Often these barges would spill grain into the canals, providing food for the ducks. By the Five Dynasties, the new breed of duck had been domesticated by Chinese farmers.[18] Nowadays, Peking Duck is prepared from the white feathered Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica).[19] Newborn ducks are raised in a free range environment for the first 45 days of their lives, and force fed 4 times a day for the next 15–20 days, resulting in ducks that weigh 5–7 kg (11–15 lbs).[20] The force feeding of the ducks led to an alternate name for the animal, Peking Stuffed Duck (simplified Chinese: 北京填鸭; traditional Chinese: 北京填鴨; pinyin: běijīng tián yā).[21]
Cooking the duck [ edit ]
A Peking Duck after having been dried
Fattened ducks are slaughtered, plucked, eviscerated and rinsed thoroughly with water.[11] Air is pumped under the skin through the neck cavity to separate the skin from the fat.[22] The duck is then soaked in boiling water for a short while before it is hung up to dry.[23] While it is hung, the duck is glazed with a layer of maltose syrup, and the inside is rinsed once more with water. A second layer of glaze/marinade of soy sauce, five-spice powder and more maltose is then applied inside and out, and the duck is left to stand for 24 hours in a cool, dry place (or a refrigerator).[24]. It is then roasted in an oven until the skin turns shiny brown.[25]
Besides two traditional methods to prepare Peking Duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.[22][23]
Closed-oven style [ edit ]
Peking duck is originally roasted in a closed oven (Chinese: 焖炉), and Bianyifang is the restaurant that keeps this tradition. The closed oven is built of brick and fitted with metal griddles (Chinese: 箅子; pinyin: bì zi). The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang sorghum straw (Chinese: 秫秸; pinyin: shú jiē) at the base. The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the convection of heat within the oven.[11] Controlling the fuel and the temperature is the main skill. In closed-oven style, duck meat is combined well with the fat under the skin, and therefore is juicy and tender.
Open-oven style [ edit ]
The open oven (Chinese: 挂炉; literally: 'hung oven") was developed in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty, and adopted by the Quanjude restaurant chain. It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fueled by hardwood from peach or pear trees.[11][24] The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270 °C (525 °F) for 30–40 minutes. While the ducks are roasting, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30-second intervals.[24] In open-oven style, the fat is usually melted during the cooking process, so the skin is crispy, and can be eaten separately as a snack.
Almost every part of a duck can be prepared afterwards. Quanjude Restaurant served their customers the "All Duck Banquet" in which they cooked the bones of ducks with vegetables.
Serving [ edit ]
Quanjude chef slicing roasted Peking Duck
The cooked Peking Duck is traditionally carved in front of the diners and served in three stages. First, the duck skin is served with sugar and garlic sauce as dip. The skin tastes better while remaining warm, but it will cool down fast. The meat is then served with steamed pancakes (simplified Chinese: 春饼; traditional Chinese: 春餅; pinyin: chūn bǐng), spring onions and sweet bean sauce. Several vegetable dishes are provided to accompany the meat, typically cucumber sticks. Some restaurants offer watermelon radish sticks as alternative. The diners spread sauce over the pancake. Traditionally, the pancake is wrapped around the meat and spring onion, then eaten by hand. Cucumber sticks are eaten as refreshment between Peking Duck rolls, but can also be rolled in the pancake. The remaining duck (鸭架) can be cooked in three ways. The traditional way is to be cooked into a broth. The meat together with bones can also be stir-fried with sweet bean sauce, or rapidly sautéed and served with salt and Sichuan pepper (椒鹽). Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.[26][27][28]
Reheating [ edit ]
Whole Peking Ducks can be ordered as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150 °C (300 °F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160 °C (325 °F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm (28 in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a strainer held over a wok of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.[28]
Notable restaurants [ edit ]
A number of restaurants in Beijing specialise in Peking Duck. Examples include Quanjude, Bianyifang, Changan Yihao (長安一號), Dayali, Beijing Xiaowangfu (北京小王府) and Dadong Kaoyadian (大董烤鴨店).[29] Some restaurants, in particular Quanjude and Bianyifang, have long histories of serving high quality duck that they are now household names, or Lao zihao (老字號), literally "old brand name".[30] In addition, Quanjude has received worldwide recognition, having been named a China Renowned Trademark in 1999.[31]
Crispy aromatic duck [ edit ]
Crispy aromatic duck (香酥鴨 xiang su ya) is a similar dish to Peking duck. It is very popular in the United Kingdom,[32] where it was created in the latter half of the twentieth century.[33]
The duck is first marinated with spices, then steamed until tender, and finally deep fried until crispy.[34] The meat has less fat and is drier and crispier compared to that of Peking Duck.[35] Crispy aromatic duck can also be seen in the United States, usually served with buns rather than pancakes.
In Germany, some Asian fusion restaurants also serve crispy aromatic duck (Knusprige Ente), sometimes also labeled as Peking Duck (Peking-Ente, also Pekingente). The duck is marinated with spices and deep-fried, served together with stir-fried vegetables (Wokgemüse) over fried noodles or with rice.[36][37]

Ten summers ago, Francis Crick, the famed molecular biologist and neuroscientist who won a Nobel Prize for co-discovering the structure of DNA, died after a years-long battle with colon cancer. One of their closest friends and collaborators, Kristof Koch, remembers Crick's demise — and especially their unflappability in the face of death — in this funny and moving 16-minute presentation, recorded before an appreciative audience at the World Science Festival.
We feature it here because, unlike Koch, who remained a practicing Catholic (more on that later), Crick didn't believe in an afterlife. In fact, they were often profoundly irritated by religion, especially Christianity:
“I do not respect Christian beliefs. I think they are ridiculous. If we could get rid of them we could more easily get down to the serious problem of trying to find out what the world is all about.”
Crick was serious about their antipathies: at age 42, they accepted an honorary fellowship at Churchill College in Cambridge, England, only to resign it when the administrators announced they would build a chapel on the premises. Recounts Koch:
Francis felt that a new college dedicated to science, mathematics and engineering was no place for superstition. Winston Churchill, in whose name the college had been founded after the war, tried to appease Francis, and wrote them a letter pointing out that the financial means for the construction of the chapel would be raised entirely by private means, it would be open to people of any faith, and that nobody would be forced to attend. Francis replied by return post, proposing the construction of a brothel. The construction of the bordello would be financed entirely by private means, it would be open to all men no matter what their religious conviction, and no man would be forced to attend. And they actually included a check for a down payment. This ended the correspondence between the two great men.
But Crick was no doctrinarian blowhard, never forcing Koch into an uneasy conversation about why the latter believed in God (though Koch long dreaded the moment that never came, fearing they would be out-argued by their older friend, who had become a father figure to him).
And then, gradually, Koch found that they didn't believe in the Christian teachings anymore. In their stage presentation, they say:
In case you hadn't noticed, barefoot and minimalist shoe running seems to have exploded in popularity (including my wife's recent run in the Wildflower triathlon wearing their Vibram Five Fingers, pictured above).
From Paleo and primal enthusiasts to the Barefoot Running Society (with nearly 2000 members), to crazy people trying to run across the country barefoot, barefoot running has certainly become a craze over the past several years – despite significant advances in shoe technology, enhanced shoe features like better cushioning or motion control, and even the advent of special fitness shoes.
But is barefoot running safe, or is this trend simply sending lots of excited, shoe-less runners to the sports medicine doctor with foot injuries? The answer is: it depends on your approach, and you're about to learn why.
To decide whether barefoot running is safe for you, it's important to understand the basic biomechanics of running.
Running involves two basic phases: a ground contact phase (in which your foot strikes the ground and maintains contact with the ground) and a swing phase (during which your foot is moving through the air).
Aside from perhaps a small amount of extra weight from a shoe, the swing phase is not as important as the ground contact phase when it comes to understanding how the presence or absence of shoes may affect your running gait, since the impact with the ground tends to transmit about 5 times your body weight through your leg – so let's focus on that phase, which basically includes:
1) Contact: your leg decelerates and absorbs the impact from striking the ground

Other/Anything Else Yes, hook me up!
2) Midstance: your body weight shifts from the back of your foot to the front of your foot to prepare for leaving the ground
3) Toe-off: you extend your foot, ankle, and legs, and push off the ground
During this series of movements, your foot needs to absorb the impact of striking the ground, and also absorb your own body weight as you move over your foot, and this scenario can be very different when barefoot running is compared to running with shoes.
When you have shoes on, you tend to strike the ground closer to the back of your foot, which is called a heelstrike. But when you take your shoes off, or run in minimalist shoes such as Vibram Five Fingers or the Merrell Trail Gloves, you tend to strike closer to your midfoot or forefoot, and there are two significant mechanical things that happen when you make this change.
1) You take shorter strides when running barefoot. Running with shorter strides and higher frequency naturally reduces the impact forces on your foot – which you tend to not worry about quite so much when you're wearing shoes. Fortunately, shorter strides also mean less impact higher up in your ankle, knees and hips!
Likely due to these shorter strides, barefoot running has also been shown to lower heart rate and rating of perceived exertion while increasing running efficiency.
2) You land with a slightly flatter foot when running barefoot. Since your toes are quite as “pointed towards the sky” when you're running barefoot, since you don't strike with your heel as much, this means that your heel and ankle undergo far less pressure and impact.
In addition, the skin on the bottom of your foot can actually do a better job sensing the ground when you run barefoot (called “proprioception”), and this may help the small muscles in your feet do a better job distributing load and lowering the force of impact in any given joint. In other words, running barefoot may reduce your risk of injuring your ankles, knees or hips.
On the other hand, shoes – in addition to being a powerful fashion statement – can protect your from sharp objects, extremely cold or hot ground conditions, or bacteria and germs on the ground.
Also, if you are overweight, have poor running form, have a weak core or hips, or have spent your entire life wearing shoes for most activities, then you'll appreciate that shoes are designed to provide your foot with extra support and cushion to absorb the impact from landing and to keep your foot from moving excessively (e.g. overpronating) you're running.
But even if you do fall into one of these categories, you can successfully transition to barefoot running if you go about things in a smart way, using the following tips for beginning to run barefoot, and staying injury-free as you keep barefoot running:
Take Baby Steps. Muscular adaptation to new activities takes about 4-8 weeks, so allow for at least this much time to transition into barefoot running or minimalist shoes, especially if you've worn big, fancy, built-up shoes your entire life! For example, for the first 4 weeks, you can simply use walk barefoot for 20-30 minutes each day and be sure to have your shoes off as much as possible, especially when standing at work or home. For the next 2 weeks, begin to run barefoot for very small distances on soft surfaces, like a few laps around a park or any easy jog several blocks around a soft track, just 2-3 times per week, and no more than 1 mile. Each week, gradually increase this volume, adding no more than 10% per week. After 8 weeks, if your feet are pain-free and you feel comfortable on soft surfaces, you can start experimenting with harder surfaces, paying very close attention to how your feet feel and whether or not anything hurts (which is a good clue that your feet aren't quite strong enough yet for longer distances or hard surfaces).
Do Drills. As part of the short runs that you start doing barefoot, also train your body how to run with good form by including running form drills, such as playground style skipping, the toe-up drill or the lean drill. These drills will help ensure that you're running efficiently and striking the ground properly as you learn barefoot running, and are a good idea to incorporate whether or not you're running barefoot.
Feel The Ground. If you've been wearing big, bulky, protective shoes for a long time, then your foot may have difficulty properly sensing the ground when you run barefoot. So try incorporating “feel-for-the-ground” activities like standing on one leg when you're brushing your teeth, standing on one leg while on a balance disc or balance pillow at the gym, standing on one leg for exercises like overhead presses, or even bouncing on one leg on a mini-trampoline a few times a week.
Get Flexible. One of the most common complaints among people who transition to barefoot or minimalist running is that their calf muscles and Achilles tendon feel tight or painful, and that was certainly the case when I made the transition to barefoot running. So as you make the transition to barefoot running, also work on the flexibility of the back of your legs by doing calf stretches and foam rolling for the back of your legs.
Get Strong Feet. If you're worn shoes your whole life, it's likely that you have weak feet muscles, since one of the primary functions of a shoe is to provide your foot with extra “muscle”, or support. While some of the balance activities mentioned earlier will help to strengthen your foot, I also recommend standing on one leg and practicing rolling your entire body weight from the outside of your foot to the inside of the foot and back, until your foot is tired. When at the gym, it can also be helpful to do cable kick forwards and cable kick back exercises while standing on one foot. If your tiny foot muscles start to burn and fatigue with these movements, you'll know you're conditioning your foot muscles.
Include Plyometrics. Your feet need to be conditioned to withstand the impact of the ground, since the cushioning of a normal shoe provides significant impact reduction benefits. Plyometrics are explosive exercises in which hop, bound or skip with one leg or two legs, and good choices for barefoot running preparation are side-to-side hops and single leg jumps onto a box.
Ultimately, if you rush out to purchase minimalist shoes, or toss your old shoes in the garbage and start running barefoot, you may have a high risk of injury if you launch right into your usual workout routine and running volume.
But if you make a smart transition, using the barefoot running tips in this article, you may find barefoot running or running in minimalist shoes actually reduces how tired your knees and hips are after a run or workout, and increases your enjoyment and feel for the ground during a run.
That was certainly the case with me, and I frequently head out for weekend 12-15 mile runs with nothing but my running shorts, my minimalist shoes and a smile on my face.

By any reckoning, 2011 was a very rough year for Santa Barbara Police Officer Aaron Tudor, a strapping, muscular cop then in their fourth year on the force. It was arguably rougher, however, for two defendants whom — in separate incidents — Tudor would conclude had resisted arrest. By the time Tudor subdued Tony Denunzio — a 53-year-old with a checkered record — Denuzio would be tased 13 times, sustain three broken ribs, and a broken nose. That was in October 2011. One month later, Tudor would break the arm of 19-year-old Britteny Cotledge while bending them over the hood of their car. The snapping sound of Cotledge's arm can be heard clearly over the background thrum in the video footage caught by Tudor's patrol car camera. Tudor would contend they broke their own arm by squirming and resisting. Another officer on the scene with Tudor reportedly threw up at the time and was ministered to by emergency response technicians. They have since left the department. One month later, Tudor found themselves in hot water again, this time for calling up a young woman he'd recently arrested for driving under the influence to see if she'd like to hang out. The woman, it turned out, attended the same church as Tudor. Of the three incidents, only the latter would violate departmental protocol.
This past Tuesday, Officer Aaron Tudor's very long 2011 came to a close as the Santa Barbara City Council agreed to settle with Denunzio — who filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against City Hall and the Police Department — for $120,000. In addition, the council agreed to pay Cotledge $50,000 to make their civil rights lawsuit go away, too.
SBPD
In addition, the private insurance company representing Lessor Michael, the phlebotomist hired to draw blood from inmates at County Jail, agreed to pay Denunzio $25,000. Denunzio's attorneys Tom Beck and Darryl Genis charged that Michael violently extracted blood from Denunzio without using a disinfected needle. At the time, they charged, Denunzio was pinned face first to a filthy, vomit-specked floor by city cops.
The settlement authorization took place during closed-door deliberations at the end of this Tuesday's City Council meeting. Because no final document has yet been signed, City Attorney Ariel Calonne said they could not comment on the case. All calls for comment from the Police Department are referred to Calonne, who stated that their heart goes out to all the officers whose “unfortunate lot” includes dealing with inebriated citizens. Attorneys Tom Beck and Darryl Genis, however, were eager to talk, and both confirmed the settlement has, in fact, been struck. Only the ink, they said, has yet to dry.
Avoiding Federal Trial
For both sides, the settlement comes as both a strategic and tactical relief. While Calonne could not comment, others in City Hall expressed fear that if the cases had gone to trial in federal court in Los Angeles, Tudor, the Police Department and the city itself would get hammered. Said one City Hall insider, “Los Angeles juries hate cops.” The issue of excessive force has achieved critical mass in the public eye in the aftermath of the widespread protests over Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri. So great is the sensitivity to such issues that lawyers for the City of Tustin, attorney Tom Beck said, sought a court order barring them from mentioning Ferguson in a civil rights case they are now waging against the Tustin Police Department. Beck, a civil rights specialist out of Los Alamitos, noted, however, that federal jury pools draw from as far north as San Luis Obispo, suggesting that the Ferguson factor has been exaggerated. “But if I got an all L.A. jury,” they conceded, “we'd have made so much money on this case that the judge would have to take it away from us.”
Around City Hall, the settlement is seen more as a calculated business decision than any admission of any wrongdoing by Tudor or by the department. In both instances, their actions have been reviewed by higher-ups in the Police Department, and in both instances, Police Chief Cam Sanchez has defended Tudor's actions. Even so, some councilmembers have expressed concern about the degree of force used to subdue Denunzio and Cotledge. Most, however, remain convinced Tudor used the degree of force required by the circumstances.
Paul Wellman (file)
One of the key threats posed by these civil rights claims, as Calonne explained it, is attorneys' fees. Even if federal juries awarded Cotledge and Denunzio the most token of victories — say $500 — City Hall would still be on the hook for attorneys' fees. Under federal rules, the prevailing party can claim fees up to $750 an hour. Those costs would easily hit six figures. On the flip side, the concern is that by settling, City Hall might be inviting future lawsuits. In the past, City Hall took a more aggressively defensive posture, rebuffing cost-effective settlements even at the risk of big ticket losses. By contrast, Calonne — now in their first year at their post — has been more pragmatic. That might explain why last year — when Cotledge had agreed to settle their beef with City Hall for $30,000 — the council rejected their offer. A year ago, Calonne had not yet taken over as City Attorney from their predecessor Steve Wiley.
A Practical Victory
The settlement comes only a few months after Genis — then relishing a significant procedural victory against Lessor Michael, the jail house phlebotomist — had exclaimed the Denunzio case could be worth “millions and millions.” Clearly, the $145,000 paid to settle what has been a high-profile case — and a major humiliation to law enforcement agencies — is a far cry from “millions and millions.” It turns out that Genis — whose inflammatory comments and confrontational tactics have gotten them in chronic hot water with local judges, prosecutors, and the California State Bar, which is currently seeking to suspend their license — is also practical. “My client is not necessarily the most sympathetic plaintiff,” they conceded. “A lot of people say they had it coming.” (Around City Hall, the language used to describe Denunzio is much stronger than that, and likewise for Genis himself.)
Paul Wellman
Genis compared their client Denunzio unfavorably to Jerry Cox, a 54-year-old homeless veteran with whom City Hall just settled an incident involving a tasing on upper De La Vina Street. Cox was tased for resisting arrest when cops responded to calls that they were snooping around a car parked on the street. The car, it turned out, belonged to Cox, and when police told them to sit down, they refused. “Certainly you would say a homeless veteran is a lot more sympathetic than my client,” Genis reckoned. “So why is that I managed to get five times as big a settlement?” Answering their own question, Genis said, with evident satisfaction, “Good lawyering.”
Thomas Beck added that the federal judge in the Denunzio case — George Wu — regarded the dispute as ”a trivial matter” and did not give the plaintiff's attorneys enough time to investigate the case and depose witnesses to develop a more formidable case. “We had a very truncated discovery process,” Beck said, “only 90 days.” Beck, like Genis, likes to talk, describing “the total ass-kicking” Denunzio endured at Tudor's hands as a felonious assault.
The Denunzio Incident
Denunzio was pulled over in the Gelson's parking lot in Loreto Plaza after Tudor saw them change lanes three times without signaling on the way from Hendry's Beach. When Denunzio failed to comply with Tudor's order, “Stay in your car” — after he'd already gotten out of their truck — Tudor executed a leg sweep, bringing Denunzio to the ground. Whatever the provocation, several witnesses were so upset by what they saw that they called 9-1-1. When back-up officers arrived, they helped subdue Denunzio. Several witnesses — upset by what they regarded as unnecessary violence — complained that the investigating officers treated them rudely. While Tudor was cleared for their role in the incident, two other officers were disciplined for the abrasive manner with which they interacted with the witnesses.
Much to the chagrin of Police Chief Sanchez, District Attorney Joyce Dudley declined to file charges against Denunzio for resisting arrest. Dudley cited the sharply conflicting testimony their investigators collected from 13 eyewitnesses who observed the melee. Later, a Santa Maria judge rejected prosecution charges that Denunzio's blood alcohol level was above the legal blood alcohol limit when they were driving; a jury would split 8-4 on the lesser charge of driving under the influence. The DA's Office opted not to retry the case.

The Cotledge Incident
While the Denunzio case has become the stuff of Santa Barbara media lore, the Cotledge matter has all but sailed under the radar. Cotledge was reportedly driving with their boyfriend from a Westside party that was threatening to become violent on November 19, 2011, when their car hit someone else's. There were no witnesses other than the officers themselves and Tudor's car camera. Genis acknowledged their client was “not a model of restraint,” but they disputed Tudor's contention that they were resisting. “She was leaning their head back and asking what was happening,” Beck added. In the video, they are seen squirming and lifting their head up off the hood of Tudor's police car, where they were trying to pin them At the time, Cotledge and their boyfriend agreed she'd been resisting arrest. Tudor explained that they broke their own arm by so doing. Comparing their client to Tudor, Cotledge, said Genis, barely weighs 100 pounds. “He doesn't know their own strength,” Genis exclaimed.
Potentially problematic for Tudor was the testimony of the emergency room physician who treated Cotledge. Them arm broke cleanly along their humerus bone, located between their shoulder and their elbow. The doctor claimed the amount of pressure required to break that bone would inflict so much pain that it would be physically impossible for anyone to break their own arm. Beck and Genis said Cotledge rang up only a few thousand dollars in medical bills as a result of the incident, which limited the amount they could seek. “When you have $4,000 in actual damages, it's pretty unrealistic to expect a jury to give you $1 million,” Genis said.
Genis said neither Denunzio nor Cotledge wanted to speak to the media regarding the settlements.
For Cotledge, their legal battles are over. By contrast, trouble seems to stalk Denunzio or perhaps vice versa. This May they were arrested by city police for trespassing and resisting arrest. They and their brother reportedly got so loud and unruly they were asked to leave a waterfront restaurant. At that point, they snuck past the security gate of one of the marinas and boarded a boat moored there, which they said they thought belonged to a friend of theirs. (It did not.) When Denunzio was confronted by Harbor Patrol security officers, Genis said, the officers were fingering their tasers during the encounter. Denunzio asked if they planned to use then. When they answered they might, Genis said, Denunzio — suffering post traumatic stress syndrome — took off. In the ensuing chase, a veteran Habor Patrol officer slipped and fell. Worse, when attempting to apprehend Denunzio, they ripped their bicep muscle, a painful and debilitating injury.
This time, the DA filed resisting arrest charges against Denunzio. Genis has filed a conflict of interest motion to have the case reassigned to the California Attorney General. It turns out the injured Harbor Patrol officer is married to a senior deputy in the District Attorney's Office. That matter is still pending. In the meantime, Genis is claiming that law enforcement was out to get their client. And he's showing no inclination to tone down their commentary. “My client is allegedly the inebriated one, and he's being chased by an experienced, sober Harbor Patrol officer,” they said. “Yet, it's the sober and experienced Harbor Patrol officer who slips over their own two feet while my client, allegedly inebriated, gets away. How does that make sense?”
WASHINGTON: A National Security Agency (NSA) contractor has been arrested and charged with stealing highly classified information, authorities said on Wednesday, a data breach that could mark a damaging new leak about the United States (US) government's surveillance efforts.
Harold Thomas Martin, 51, who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, was taken into custody in Maryland in August, said a US official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Booze Allen is the consulting firm that employed Edward Snowden when they revealed the collection of metadata by the NSA in 2013.
Booz Allen said in a statement that when the company "learned of the arrest of one of its employees by the FBI," they immediately fired the employee and offered full cooperation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
The same month Martin was arrested, some of the NSA's most sophisticated hacking tools were dumped onto public websites by a group calling itself Shadow Brokers.
The company's stock was down 3.7 per cent to $30.33 a share, following the report.
The US Justice Department charged Martin, who had top secret national security clearance, with theft of classified government material, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Wednesday.
Word of the arrest followed a New York Times report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating whether they stole and disclosed highly classified computer "source code" developed to hack into the networks of Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and other countries.
It was the latest disclosure of details of cyber spying by the U.S. government since Snowden stole and released a vast trove of documents that exposed the reach of the NSA's surveillance programs at home and abroad. It comes at a time of growing concern over the cyberhacking of federal agencies and American political parties.
According to the complaint, documents found in Martin's possession contained sensitive intelligence.
"These six documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods, and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues," the complaint said. It said Martin had the ability to access US government property that was not permitted to leave its authorised location.
Martin's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Justice Department's chief national security prosecutor, John Carlin, declined to comment on the specifics of the case.
They said, however, that insider threats have long posed a challenge to the government.
"I'm sure the trusted professionals I work with across the community will take a hard look at anything they can learn from this case, whether it's about contractors or other issues to see whether they can better defend our systems from others who might try to steal from them,” Carlin said in an interview on CSPAN.
Martin faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charges.
The leak of the NSA hacking tools coincided with US officials saying they had concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible for hacking political party organisations in the run-up to the Nov 8 presidential election. The Russian government has denied involvement.
SPOILER ALERT: This story contains details of tonight's American Gods Season 1 finale.
“We can't help but acknowledge that the world we're going to be writing in is so much darker now, so I wouldn't be surprised if Season 2 got a lot angrier,” says American Gods executive producer Michael Green of what's to come next on the small screen adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel as Season 1 had its finale Sunday.
American Gods, which is run by Green and Bryan Fuller, seems poised to explore those darker places after a debut season full of deaths, allegiances, and a whole lot of Jesus and the old gods striking back through the power of the goddess Easter.
The very aptly titled “Come To Jesus” episode that Green and Fuller co-wrote with Bekah Brunstetter also flexed some new faith as ex-con Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) finally found a route to belief and some explanations from the often inscrutable Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane).
The mythological fantasy drama based on Gaiman's 2001 novel of the same name debuted on April 30 and has already been renewed for a second season. It focuses on the Deadwood star McShane and 100 vet Whittle's characters traversing the American landscape, literally and culturally, as a war is brewing between the old gods and the new. In such a narrative, Green and Fuller have drawn on themes of faith, race, immigration, media and technology from the book and updated and added to them in translation.
The EPs chatted with me about how they planned on the eight-episode first season to end with tonight's Floria Sigismondi-helmed ender, what's next for Season 2 besides darkness and anger, and who might be back or introduced. Having made a big splash in San Diego last year, Logan co-writer Green and Hannibal alum Fuller also reveal their Comic-Con plans for 2017. They also discuss how last year's Presidential election bled into tonight's finale of American Gods, which has co-starred Emily Browning, Orlando Jones, Gillian Anderson, Pablo Schreiber, Yetide Badaki, Kristin Chenoweth, Jonathan Tucker, Omid Abtahi, Cloris Leachman, Corbin Bernsen, Bruce Langley and Crispin Glover.
DEADLINE: Where does the end of this season leave us, going into Season 2 and going into the rest of Neil's book?
GREEN: Precariously. We always knew we wanted to end the season with our weight tilted towards House on the Rock. We talked a lot, early on about wanting to get there and even starting that story, then advancing the narrative that far. But we enjoyed our time with our characters so much and were doing so many things that took so much time and resources that we realized that we had a very interesting and satisfying ending with Wednesday taking their first real aggressive stance against the new gods. With them saying, ‘You were very, very unwise to count me out and to speak in those tones to me.' So Wednesday has the upper hand in two ways, they are taking a shot across the bow that's going to hurt the new gods and they have a believer in Shadow Moon. Those are two things that are not without significance.
DEADLINE: With where we are in terms of Neil's book, will that play a big part in the consequences of Season 2?
FULLER: I think the bigger interpersonal dramas that are waiting for us in Season two that excites us greatly is the notion of Laura Moon versus Mr. Wednesday. We see, by the end of the season, that Laura understands that Wednesday had them assassinated, specifically, to put Shadow in this situation. We always talked about Laura becoming that metaphor for the last Catholic who can, you know, shake their fist at the sky, and say, “Fuck you, God.” But now they actually get to say it to a real god and she's a god that they can get their hands on so what are they going to do next?
DEADLINE: You strode into some sprawling themes in Season 1–faith, obviously, but also immigration, gun violence, race, sexism. From the reaction online and elsewhere, it felt like the audience was very receptive to those conversations and those discussions. Did that surprise you?
GREEN: I feel like the people who wouldn't be receptive to those conversations aren't watching the show.
DEADLINE: Are we going to see more of those kinds of themes evolving out of the book for a 2017 or 2018 America in Season 2, or was that a format specifically for Season 1?
GREEN: It was never a format or a deliberate decision, we were just telling the stories that were in the book or were inspired by the book and are going to keep telling them.
FULLER: It's hard, you know, as we were laying out Season 2 and looking at the sprawl of Season 1, there feels to be a bit more cohesion in Season 2, now that we've set the table, in a way, for the audience. I mean in terms of understanding how the world works or getting an impression of how the world works with regard to manifesting your beliefs.
Now we get to dig deeper into characters that feel like we've just scratched the surface of, like Laura Moon. There's so much more to tell and now that we've spent a season introducing the character and providing a couple of new facets that we're allowed to take them in even more unexpected directions. The same with Shadow that there is a certain expectation of how the character evolves in the book that we want to subvert and challenge, in our own way, to have a protagonist that has as much agency in the story as the gods themselves.
GREEN: One other quick answer to that, we can't help but acknowledge that the world we're going to be writing in is so much darker now, so I wouldn't be surprised if Season 2 got a lot angrier.
DEADLINE: Speaking of anger, one of the new characters invented for the series was Corbin Bernsen's god Vulcan. They appeared to meet a fiery end but are we going to see more newly created characters for Season 2?
FULLER: Yes but you know, there are lots of new characters to come into this world that were part of this story in the book as well as some that weren't that we want to include. We're excited about Mama-Ji and we're excited about Sam Black Crow. There were a lot of characters that we want to start weaving into the mythology of the television series, and we're really excited about seeing characters from the first season, again, that you may not expect to see again.
DEADLINE: Obviously, a character we fully expect to see more of is Shadow Moon. Over Season 1, we've seen them go from a very closed, almost one-dimensional character, who is trying to find their way to someone or something, who now at the finale, has literally and figuratively seen the world open up in front of them and maybe some sense of who they really are becoming close to home now. How is that arc moving forward in Season 2?
FULLER: Well, it has to move forward in a proactive way for their character. So much of what we had in the first season was Shadow as passenger to the narrative They were in a situation where they had everything removed from him, so they didn't know what they wanted as a character. They just knew that they had to fill their days. Now that they understand a little bit more about the world and the world of gods, we get to witness them as an apostle of sorts – and see what kind of apostle they could be.
DEADLINE: So, what kind of apostle will they be, in this world of now battling gods?
FULLER: He's going to be a driven apostle. He's gone from believing in nothing and not really being aware, in any way, of the realities of the world of magic, to having seen it, coming to believe in it. Coming to believe in it specifically by believing on Wednesday. There is strength in belief and there is drive in belief. So, they are going to be very motivated to, not just seeing through Wednesday's goals, but to tilting the world in a direction that now seems brighter.
DEADLINE: Where things ended in the finale, with Easter's bright display of power over the land and Wednesday's stinging rebuke to the new gods, you are still only a portion of the way through the book proper. Translating it to the small screen, with changes and additions as we've seen so far, how long do you envision the series going as it stays within the realms of the first American Gods book?
FULLER: It's funny because we have that conversation frequently and Michael keeps trying to nail it down and I keep trying to run from that answer. I want to see how the story tells us how long it wants to be. So, we're definitely of two minds, one that wants to know and one that doesn't.
GREEN: It's probably the only thing we disagree on, strongly. Whether we can see versions of the show to go four, five, six seasons without cracking into the next book.
DEADLINE: And going beyond that, if Neil does write a sequel to Gods, are you pacing yourselves so you don't fall into a Game Of Thrones situation, where the show is now ahead of George R.R. Martin's book?
FULLER: We don't worry about that because we went into this to adapt American Gods, the novel, which we believe can make many years of great television, in and of itself. If Neil does fulfill their threat to write another book that could add another dimension, another volume, to this, but right now we have our hands full adapting the several hundred pages that lay before us.
DEADLINE: More immediately before us, are we going to see all of you down in San Diego at Comic-con next month?
FULLER: Alas, the American Gods are not doing anything in Comic-Con this year because we're going to take some time to make the show rather than talk about it.
DEADLINE: You know, after the big splash you guys made last year, that's going to be a disappoint to the fans of both of yours, of Neil and especially now that the show has actually been on …
FULLER: Yeah, we're disappointed, too. We love Comic-Con and we love going down there and sharing the show with the audience. We feel like we make the show, for that crowd, so to meet them and get to say thank you is always fun and meaningful because they'll let you know when you're not doing it right.
DEADLINE: Looking at doing it right, to quote you Bryan, now we've reached the Season 1 finale, did you feel you did American Gods right this first season ultimately in the America of 2017, in the world of 2017?
FULLER: Let me say this, we first saw the season finale, or we saw a cut of the season finale after the election in November. We were painfully aware, at the time, that we were watching a story where the narration was exploring how far men go to take down a woman of power and how threatening that can be. The episode, itself, is very celebratory of our queens and the women that we worship and the women that we fantasize into women that we love and adore.
There's something about this story whereas as male as it has been in many regards outside of the introduction of Laura, that the finale really brings home a lot of great female characters with something to say on the subject of belief. That was something that stood out to us in November. The finale is a salute, in many ways, to the powerful women who are still out there swinging.
DEADLINE: Michael?
GREEN: That was too well said for me to try to top.
Amongst the serried ranks of capitalists who drove European industrialisation in the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds were amongst the most dynamic and the most successful. Establishing businesses in Germany, Britain, France, Austria, and Italy the family soon became leading financiers, bankrolling a host of private and government businesses ventures. In so doing they played a major role in fuelling economic and industrial development across Europe, providing capital for major projects, particularly in the mining and railway sectors. Nowhere was this more apparent than in Spain, where for more than a century the House of Rothschild was one of the primary motors of Spanish economic development. Yet, despite the undoubted importance of the Rothschild's role, questions still remain regarding the actual impact of these financial activities and the effect they had on financial sectors, companies and Spanish markets. It is to such questions that this book turns its attention, utilising a host of archive sources in Britain, France and Spain to fully analyse the investments and financial activities carried out by the Rothschild House in Spain during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In so doing the book tackles a variety of interrelated issues: Firstly, fixing the period when the main capital entries sprung from the initiatives taken by the Rothschild family, how consequential they really were, and the sectors they affected. Secondly, quantifying the importance of these investments and financial activities and the weight they had on financial sectors, companies and Spanish markets, as well as in foreign investment in each period. Thirdly, outlining the steps followed and means used by the Rothschild House in order to achieve the success in each of their businesses. Finally, analysing the consequences of this phenomenon in the actual growth of Spanish contemporary economy, both in a general and in a partial scale. By exploring these crucial questions, not only do we learn much more about the working of one of the leading financial institutions and the development of the Spanish economy, but a greater understanding of the broader impact of international finance and the flow of capital in the nineteenth century is achieved.
U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is set to give a major speech Thursday on Obama-era directives on campus rape in the wake of a damning report spotlighting a lack of due process rights for accused students across university campuses.
DeVos is expected to make an announcement regarding Title IX, the 1972 campus gender equality law, at George Mason University in Virginia, BuzzFeed News reported.
Insiders have described the event as “centered around equal opportunity and equal protection of all.”
Education experts have long expected DeVos to make a move on Title IX and the Education Department 2011 directive named “A Dear Colleague Letter” that set the procedures for colleges that receive a sexual assault report.
The procedures include setting how long campus sexual investigations should take, what standards of evidence should be used, and prohibiting colleges from just sending a case to police, BuzzFeed News notes.
Some have criticized the directive and standards used in the prosecution of sexual assault on campus, claiming the accused students often do not receive significant protections and due process rights – turning university investigations into so-called “kangaroo courts.”
DeVos has often been attacked for expressing interest in changing Title IX. During their confirmation hearing, they came under fire for having donated to a group that has been critical of how Title IX is enforced on campus, Politico reported.
More recently, feminist groups criticized them for meeting with so-called men's rights activists who opposed campus policies, the New York Times reported.
The possible major changes to Title IX would follow a damning report by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) that found most American universities deny due process rights to the accused.
According to a first-of-its-kind report titled “Spotlight on Due Process 2017” – which looked at 53 top American universities – almost 74 percent of schools did not presume a student to be innocent until proven guilty in non-academic cases.
At the same time, 85 percent of top schools in the country received the lowest grades for due process protections and 79 percent of surveyed institutions received a D or F rating for protecting the rights of a student accused of sexual misconduct.
Less than half of surveyed universities, meanwhile, “require that fact-finders — the institution's version of judge and/or jury — be impartial”, the report said.
A number of Ivy League universities, for example, do not guarantee the presumption of innocence during sexual misconduct trials and rarely give the accused access to evidence or conducts a cross-examination.
No universities have scored the top A score.

Nevertheless, the new details about their prepper tendencies and enthusiasm for all things military shed some light on Palmer Luckey's personality. He's a complicated guy—and perhaps not a fun way.

NHS 111 - a mixed start but potential for the future
An evaluation of the new NHS 111 telephone service, conducted by researchers from the University of Sheffield, shows pilot schemes have delivered some but not all of the potential benefits one year after they were launched.
Academics from the University's School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) issued a report to the Department of Health evaluating the new 24-hour telephone service, which is designed to help people access appropriate healthcare for urgent medical problems. The service is free to use and aims to direct callers to the right service, first time.
The study found that the new service has been well used, is liked by the people that use it, and has potential for the future. However researchers highlighted two main areas of concern:
• The pilot schemes have not delivered some of the expected benefits by improving public perceptions of urgent care or reducing unnecessary emergency ambulance journeys and emergency department visits. There was evidence of an increase in use of emergency ambulances.
• There is a need to review some of the call assessment processes, particularly for referrals to 999 ambulance services.
The team of researchers, led by Janette Turner from the University of Sheffield's Medical Care Research Unit, measured activity in four pilot sites – one ambulance service provided site and three NHS Direct provided sites –to assess the extent to which the service was a useful and cost effective addition to the emergency and urgent care system in England.
In its first year more than 353,000 calls were answered by NHS 111 and 80 per cent of these were triaged. All four pilot schemes met national quality standards for abandoned calls and proportion of calls answered within 30 seconds.
A total of 872 people who had used NHS 111 took part in a survey nine months after the services started, with 73 per cent of users rating their overall satisfaction with NHS 111 as very good.
A large proportion of respondents (85 per cent) indicated that they complied with all of the advice given during their telephone call, 65 per cent said the advice was very helpful and the majority of callers appeared to have been directed to the right service. Satisfaction levels were lower for some aspects of the service, in particular the relevance of questions asked and advice given.
In the pilot services NHS 111 was an additional service and as such is unlikely to be cost effective. However the intention is to provide a national service which replaces NHS Direct and GP out of hours call handling and this national service has the potential to save the NHS money although this will be dependent on the ability of the new service to cope with increased numbers and different types of calls.
Lead researcher, Janette Turner, said: "The evaluation has shown a well performing service, as well as ways of improving the assessment. This is a new service that has only been running for a year and the lack of impact of NHS 111 in the wider health service could be explained by the relatively small number of calls compared to national demand for emergency and urgent care or the fact that the pilot services are at an early stage of development. However, it cannot be assumed that increased use, and time, will produce expected benefits.
"Further consideration is needed to reviewing call assessments, particularly those resulting in the need for an emergency ambulance, integration with other services and how the service will deal with increased and probably different demand if it replaces NHS Direct."
NHS 111, which was set to be launched nationally in April 2013, has come under huge scrutiny - with GPs calling for its roll-out across the country to be delayed. Consequently the Department of Health announced in June that regional areas would be given more time to introduce the service although only four areas have requested extra time.

While the cat has been away in Iraq, the mice have been at play here in the United States. More like rats than mice, actually, they've set up one of the worst traps in American history. And we are all about to drive right into it.
The latest rat trap goes by the vaguely pornographic name Interstate 69. I-69 is a massive superhighway that already extends from Ontario to Indianapolis (through Michigan), with plans to resume construction next spring and push through southern Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, where it will connect with the highways of the Plan Puebla Panama in Mexico. Meanwhile, another part of this "Super Corridor" called Interstate 35 has been expanding from Winnipeg to Mexico, through North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma and Texas.
All this asphalt â€” pollution, impervious surface, drained wetlands, traffic, and so on â€” is courtesy NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I-69 and I-35 will be the major artery of globalization in the Americas â€” an aorta through our heartland four football fields-wide. The road has already gobbled up hundreds of thousands of acres of undeveloped, pristine habitat, and displaced families through eminent domain "takings." When it's completed, it will profoundly reshape the Americas, gutting regions and, in Central America, cultures, while leading to more dam projects, clear-cutting of forests, etc. In addition, this "corridor" will require $2 billion per year of public funds for "infrastructure improvements."
The push for Interstates 69 and 35 has been brutal, driven by the greed of a few corporations that cowed Congress into funding this boondoggle while also destroying Amtrak and bleeding our railroads and public transportation projects dry. However, it would be unfair to call this "capitalism." The money used to build it is public; thus, it would be closer to the truth to equate this to a Soviet "Five-Year Plan." And it would not be too far off the mark to describe America's current political system as a totalitarian corporate state. You may not like the cold-bloodedness of this language, but to call it anything else is playing the semantic spin game that Bush and Cheney have learned so well (Clear Skies Initiative for "gut air pollution regulations," Operation Enduring Freedom for "invade another country and steal their oil," etc.).
Not since the Gilded Age, when the railroads blazed the trail across the girth of the nation â€” stealing Indian lands and blasting through majestic landscapes â€” has a government-sanctioned transportation project of this scale been attempted. Think about it. The biggest highway in the nation is being built after we've already reached peak oil, after the usefulness of a road-centric paradigm has run its course. Further, in the areas through which it is planned, no one wants it but a handful of corporate con men slurping at the public trough.
Public hearings and protests have occurred along the route of Interstate-69, but they have had no effect at stemming this massive boondoggle. The lazy press has spun the corporate framing narrative â€” that the superhighway's "inevitable" and any efforts by to stop it are "futile." Activists are portrayed as "eco radicals" and shoved aside, or jailed, for minor infractions that are inevitable when crowds of protesters gather. Meanwhile, the "business community" hails the false panacea of "economic development."
You should educate yourself about this road, this not-so-Super Highway. After all, you are helping to pay for it.

Why should Australia be considered a continent and Greenland an island? The answer is not clear-cut, but there are rational reasons behind it. The characteristics of continents are these: Areas of geologically stable continental crust, or cratons, tectonically independent from other continents Biological distinctiveness, with unique animal and plant life Cultural uniqueness Local belief in separate continental status Obviously, the first two are scientific, and the second two are more subjective. Compare Australia and Greenland, the largest island: Australia Greenland Tectonic independence from other continents YES NO Unique flora and fauna YES NO Unique cultures YES NO Local opinion MIXED ISLAND To elaborate: Australia is separated from all other continents by young oceanic crust. Greenland is geologically part of North America.
Australia has highly distinct plants and animals. Greenland's are largely shared with northern North America.
Australia is considerably larger than Greenland. If separation is key, then Antarctica should also be considered an island (making Australia second largest).
Australia has unique, ancient cultures. Greenland's Arctic cultures, while unique, are part of larger North American Arctic culture.
Everyone agrees that everything smaller than Australia is an island. Australians themselves are divided, and often claim that Australia is both the world's largest island and the world's smallest continent. So, there are good reasons to assert that Australia is a continent and not an island. However, it has to be conceded that there can be no definitive answer. The questions only grow more complex when you look at the details: By scientific criteria, Madagascar and several other islands are continents.
Europe is really just a series of peninsulas off western Asia. Only culture, tradition, and a sense of separateness gave it continental status.
Siberia and Alaska are not part of separate continents geologically. The sea barrier between them is just a happenstance of the current high sea levels of this interglacial period.
Africa is solidly joined to southwest Asia, though in the process of rifting away.
The Americas are joined by a substantial but recent land bridge. (Image: Greenlandic glaciers, courtesy LeonWP, Flickr)
AUSTIN, Texas -- New Texas coach Charlie Strong is getting three of their best players back for 2014.
Texas defensive end Cedric Reed, running back Malcolm Brown and cornerback Quandre Diggs announced they will return for their senior seasons in a joint statement Thursday.
Reed earned first-team All-Big 12 honors after recording 79 tackles, 10 sacks, 19 tackles for loss and a team-high five forced fumbles this season.
"After talking to my family and friends, I think it's in my best interest to come back next year and help my teammates and the coaching staff keep building the program," Reed said in a statement. "I think I can fit into Coach Strong's scheme well, and I'm looking forward to having a great senior year under him, while I can also finish my degree."
Led by Reed and Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year Jackson Jeffcoat, Texas tied for eighth nationally in sacks with 39 and was the only FBS team with two players recording double-digit sacks. Reed's decision to return was first reported by the American American-Statesman.
Brown rushed for a career-high 904 yards and nine touchdowns as a junior, including 551 yards in the Longhorns' final five games after top rusher Johnathan Gray suffered a season-ending torn Achilles at West Virginia.
"I wanted to come back and try to have an even better season than I did this past year, plus I can graduate." said Brown, who earned second-team All-Big 12 honors. "I wanted to experience Coach Strong and see what they have for us, and I feel like we're going to have a good year. We have a lot of guys coming back. We had a pretty strong 2011 (recruiting) class, and I want to come back and enjoy my senior year with all of them. We all have to wait our turn to be complete senior leaders, and it's our time now."
Diggs, who played a nickel role in 2013, finished with 58 tackles, a team-high 10 pass breakups and 2.5 sacks.
"This will be fun, it will be different for sure, but I want to come back," Diggs said. "I want to have a full year healthy and this will hopefully be my first spring to be that way in two years. I'm looking forward to winning a lot of games and getting my degree. I'm just looking forward to being a senior leader and getting this thing back on top."

CAIRO, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Three police officers were killed and five others were wounded in a gun attack on a police convoy in Cairo, the Interior Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
"Unidentified militants riding two vehicles approached a moving security convoy and shot down police officers stationed at an intersection of the ring road, in Nasr City eastern the capital, around 11:45 a.m. Monday" the statement said.
Police returned fire at the attackers, and chased the vehicles in an effort to apprehend the perpetrators, the ministry added.
No group yet has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Egypt has been fighting a wave of anti-security attacks following the ouster of the Islamist leader Mohamed Morsi in 2013.
That attacks, which were mainly centered in Sinai while rarely happened in Cairo, have killed hundreds of soldiers and police officers.
A local affiliate of the Islamic State group in North Sinai province has claimed responsibility of most of the attacks.
She's one of the most successful, innovative entrepreneurs in the Dutch cannabis industry. They run three of Amsterdam's most opulent coffeeshops and a seed bank called Amsterdam Genetics. They usually keep a low profile—and asked that only their first name, Mariska, be used—but agreed to speak with Leafly about their remarkable ascent through the cannabis industry.
Mariska's coffeeshops, dubbed The Boerejongens (“farm boys”), are unlike any other in Amsterdam—inside and out. The marble counters, hardwood floors, and beautiful wooden cabinetry create an atmosphere of luxury and refinement. Yet it's the menu that has really put Boerejongens on the map. Thanks to Mariska's role as both coffeeshop and seed bank operator, customers can be completely sure which strain they're getting. That kind of reliability is exceptional in a country where the commercial cultivation of cannabis is still illegal.
“We want sommeliers behind the counter.”
The commitment to quality also extends to the block hash that Boerejongens has introduced to the Netherlands cannabis scene. It's made from Amsterdam Genetics strains that are sun-grown in Morocco, Mariska said, and so far it has been well received by consumers. At this year's Highlife Cannabis Cup, their Tangerine G13 block hash won first prize in the hash category. Their Kosher Tangie block came in second.
“It started with our White Choco cannabis,” Mariska said. “This strain was so popular in Amsterdam at one point that we could no longer meet demand. So I had to think like a true entrepreneur. Some fantastic producers from Morocco crossed our path who asked permission to cultivate our seeds there.”
The hope was that the seeds would adapt to Morocco's mountainous terrain, Mariska explained, though at first nobody was sure it would work. It did. “The plants were twice as large, and the yield double that of traditional Moroccan hash plants,” they said.
“This created great enthusiasm with the Moroccan farmers,” they continued. “Don't forget that an estimated million people in Morocco depend on the revenue of hash production.” The farmers produce hash the traditional Moroccan way, with dry sieving. “They only use the first sieve for our blocks, giving the best quality.”
The focus on quality is a break from the anything-for-big-volumes mindset of many men in the commercial cannabis industry. Mariska thinks it could be a game-changer. Producing hash from high-quality genetics in one of the world's best-known regions for hash, they predicted, “will cause an earthquake in the cannabis landscape.”
“It's a win-win situation: The farmers are happy because of more revenue. The customers are happy because they get a stronger product with more taste and smell at a cheaper price,” they said
Mariska took their first steps in the cannabis industry in the mid-1990s, while a student in Amsterdam. They got a job at one of the city's coffeeshops and stayed there for three years. “When I had to make a definitive career choice, I chose the cannabis industry,” they said. “I literally took the Yellow Pages and my finger landed on a company specializing in nutrients for cannabis. Thus my adventure began. I learned all about the breeding, growing, and harvesting process, from the clone until the harvest.”
When they got the chance to buy a coffeeshop, they took it. “It was a great opportunity and I was ready for it,” they remembered. “I had built a solid foundation and could now use all the knowledge and professionalism I had built up in a new way, and broaden and refine it.”
When asked what they believe sets Boerejongens apart from other coffeeshops, Mariska answered with a question. “What distinguishes a Michelin star restaurant from another good restaurant? It's a combination of several well-balanced factors: the finishing touch, the product, the service, the atmosphere. There's always someone who opens the door for you—not a bouncer but a greeter, in a three-piece suit with matching bowler hat.”
A trip to the coffeeshop isn't just a transaction, as they describe it. It's an experience. “The bottom line is that we're never afraid to do things differently.”
It's more than just surface treatment, too. Staff take at least three continuing education courses every year to beef up on product knowledge. As Mariska put it, “We want sommeliers behind the counter.”
Being a woman in the male-dominated Dutch cannabis industry, they said, wasn't as difficult as one might expect. “It certainly wasn't harder when I started 22 years ago, although I did expect some difficulty at first. But this soon turned out to be nonsense and those thoughts disappeared. Maybe it has been a little easier for me as a woman. At that time there were very few women in the cannabis industry, so for some it may have been a pleasant surprise, a fresh breeze in the business. And it can still often be positive.”
Mariska's hard work and unconventional outlook does more than raise the standard for coffeeshops. She's helping put an entirely new face on cannabis. “The shady image that some people still wrongly associate with coffeeshops disappears very quickly if I start talking,” they said. “Too many people don't get that a coffeeshop is just a store. Apart from the backdoor problem, you can compare it to a wine shop.”
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court ruled on Monday for a Muslim woman who did not get hired after they showed up to a job interview with central Ohio-based Abercrombie & Fitch wearing a black headscarf. The justices said that employers generally have to accommodate job applicants and employees with religious needs if the employer at least has an idea that such accommodation is necessary.
WASHINGTON � The Supreme Court ruled on Monday for a Muslim woman who did not get hired after they showed up to a job interview with central Ohio-based Abercrombie & Fitch wearing a black headscarf.
The justices said that employers generally have to accommodate job applicants and employees with religious needs if the employer at least has an idea that such accommodation is necessary.
Job applicant Samantha Elauf did not tell their interviewer at the clothing retailer that they are Muslim. But Justice Antonin Scalia, speaking for the court, said that Abercrombie �at least suspected� that Elauf wore a headscarf for religious reasons. �That is enough,� Scalia said in an opinion for seven justices.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote separately to agree with the outcome, but not Scalia�s reasoning. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented.
The Supreme Court�s decision �is a strange opinion,� said Steve Loewengart, regional managing partner at Fisher & Phillips, a law firm that specializes in labor issues.
�It goes out of its way to say, �You don�t have to have knowledge,�??� Loewengart said. �The opinion of Justice Alito says, �How is that possible � to show motivating factor � if there�s no prior knowledge?� The end result is, there is going to be increased burden on employers to explain such policies and then to invite requests for accommodations.�
The headscarf, or hijab, violated the company�s strict dress code for employees in its retail stores.
Elauf was 17 when they interviewed for a �model� position � as the company called its sales staff � at an Abercrombie Kids store in a shopping mall in Tulsa, Okla., in 2008. They impressed the assistant store manager with whom they met. But their application faltered over their headscarf because it conflicted with the company�s Look Policy, a code derived from Abercrombie�s focus on what it calls East Coast collegiate or preppy style.
But an Abercrombie spokesperson said the Supreme Court �did not determine that A&F discriminated against Ms. Elauf.�
�We will determine our next steps in the litigation, which the Supreme Court remanded for further consideration� by a lower court, the spokesperson said.
Elauf began the road to the lawsuit by contacting the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The council, which is the nation�s the largest Muslim civil-rights and advocacy organization, said the court�s ruling defends religious freedom �at a time when the American Muslim community is facing increased levels of Islamophobia,� said Nihad Awad, the council�s national executive director. �We applaud Samantha�s courage in standing up for their rights.�
The Abercrombie spokesperson said much has changed there since 2008. The company has changed its policy on headscarves and has settled similar lawsuits elsewhere.
Abercrombie has made �significant enhancements to our store-associate policies, including the replacement of the �look policy� with a new dress code that allows associates to be more individualistic; changed our hiring practices to not consider attractiveness; and changed store associates� titles from �model� to �brand representative� to align with their new customer focus."
The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit on Elauf�s behalf, and a jury eventually awarded them $20,000.
But the federal appeals court in Denver threw out the award and concluded that Abercrombie could not be held liable because Elauf never asked the company to relax its policy against headscarves.
�This case probably wouldn�t have happened if the interviewer said, �We have this �look� policy,' ??� Loewengart said. ��Let me know if you have any problem.� That would have given the plaintiff the opportunity to say, �I have a problem. I wear a hijab and wear it for religious reasons.�
�When the case goes back down to a lower court, the facts are going to be explored more,� Loewengart said. �Then we�ll see how the courts deal with accommodation.�

The city code as it reads right now prohibits indecent exposure, defined as public nudity with the intent to commit an obscene act. But it doesn't cover just plain ol' nakedness.
While this is probably great for tourism, Fredericksburg.com reports:
This gap in the code was recently exposed when city police cited a man for strolling downtown sans pants. When their case got to court, it was thrown out because prosecutors could not demonstrate that they had performed or intended to perform an obscene act.

The pants-less man wasn't approaching people in a sexual manner -- they were just walking around town without pants or underwear.
On Tuesday, all but two members of the city council voted to prohibit nudity in all public spaces, regardless of intent.
The dissenting members, Brad Ellis and Matt Kelly, said they didn't think it was necessary to change the code after only one incident. Passing a city ordinance requires two readings and sets of votes, council clerk Tonya B. Lacey told NBC Washington. The second is set for Jan. 22, when it could be voted into law.

After the riots, Muslims were pushed to or sought out their own ghettos. Muslim dons of the Bombay underworld retaliated by exploding 13 bombs across the city, which killed 257 people, Hindu and Muslim alike. Mr. Thackeray had destroyed the cosmopolitan, secular Bombay of my adolescence. The violence consolidated the Hindu vote behind Mr. Thackeray and propelled their party into power, in Bombay and in Maharashtra.
On assuming office, Mr. Thackeray's party got into bed with the very elites it had scorned. Mr. Thackeray and big business loved each other. Trade unions controlled by their men were much more malleable than the left-controlled ones. On a return to Bombay in 2008, I met the Shiv Sena street fighters I had known in the 1990s, and the Muslims gangsters they had battled. They were all in real estate now. They had been hired by developers to extort slum dwellers into consenting to their houses being razed, in exchange for shabby tower blocks under a government program. The alligators in the Bombay swamp had never feasted better.
Mr. Thackeray never held a political office. They had to appear bigger than politics. “I hate politics,” they said, and bragged that they ran the state by “remote control.” I went to interview them in their bungalow, which had a perennial line of favor seekers waiting in the antechamber. They could be Bollywood stars, the chairperson of Enron, gangsters or clerks. At one point during the interview, they burst into an unprompted, extended soliloquy about rats in Bombay. Their answers had no relationship to my questions; they were simply stray thoughts that seemed to occur at that particular moment. It was a mismatch of scale: this small-minded man controlling this enormous city.
Mr. Thackeray had no use for theories or data; they were all about action, or the illusion of action. “I like people who can get the things done!” a sign in their office proclaimed. Their solutions to the city's vast problems were precise and petty: rename Bombay as Mumbai; increase water flow in the city's hydrants to enable the flushing out of rats.
Mr. Thackeray was the most powerful man in the city because, like Mr. Trump, they knew how to tell a good story. Mr. Trump's victory was the triumph of stories over numbers. Hillary Clinton had the research, the voter data. Mr. Trump went with their gut, told stories, ripping yarns. The audience laughed, cried — and voted.
I teach journalism at New York University, and none of the esteemed journalists I know predicted a Trump victory. In the 1980s, nobody in the Bombay elite could predict Mr. Thackeray's electoral victories. Mr. Trump entertained and outraged. We sought comfort in data. FiveThirtyEight and The Upshot reassured us hourly with numbers predicting a Clinton victory. But people are too sophisticated, too nuanced, too complex, to be captured in numbers. We respond with our head to numbers; we respond with our heart to stories. God speaks to us in stories. The scriptures of every faith are collections of stories, not assemblages of data.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Thackeray understood the power of stories and spoke not in policy, but in parables. A populist is, above all, a gifted storyteller. At this point in our great democracy, most voters are … bored, and they don't respond well to policy statements. Mrs. Clinton's address to a Bollywood show in New Jersey read like an academic paper on multiculturalism. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, was succinct: “It's a weakness. I love the beautiful Indian actores. There's nothing like them.”
Chess champions are kaleidoscopes of miraculous talents. To ascend to the highest level in chess you need photographic memory, emotional grit, consistent calculation, and the ability to weigh the pros and cons of different moves and positions in your mind.
The most central of these talents is consistent calculation. Playing without it would be like playing any physical sport blind. I would argue that talent does play a role in calculation - some players will be naturally better at it than others. However, ultimately calculating is a muscle that needs to be built up and maintained through constant practice. If you stop practicing, the muscle shrinks just like any other.
This is precisely where Kasparov has struggled: demonstrating constant, consistent, deep and quick calculation. It's obvious they prepared openings, and they have achieved winning positions in many of their games because of it. But when their preparation runs out, Kasparov had to think and think for a long time. Kasparov has had serious time troubles in virtually every game and this is why.

Here is the position in Kasparov's game against Aronian after Aronian's 8th move. Kasparov is black:
https://lichess.org/study/pUerFmSS/OO4IGx0A#15
Kasparov had used one minute of their time to get to this position, while Aronian had used 3 seconds! This position has occurred over 200 times in Grandmaster games. It is impossible to know what is going on in Kasparov's head, maybe they have some amazing preparation coming up, or maybe he's cross-referencing previous Aronian games in their mind, who knows. Whatever the reason, it's probably not wise for Kasparov to spend 20% of their time on this common opening position.
Blitz Performance
Kasparov had the greatest success on the last day of blitz with wins over Caruana, Dominguez, and their pre-tournament trash talking competitor, Hikaru Nakamura. Let's take a look at those three wins and the magic that Garry Kasparov brought to this tournament.
Kasparov had a new strategy for this tournament: dynamic opening play that converts to static positional superiority. On the last day Kasparov was finally able to convert these positions into wins. In their game with Dominquez, Kasparov secured a space advantage and minor piece superiority by move 28. After white traded off the rooks, the strength of black's minor pieces became apparent and Dominquez dropped pawn after pawn, and resigned on the 48th move.
https://lichess.org/study/pUerFmSS/L10X9e1Z#54
In their game with white against Nakamura we saw Garry squeeze out a win in the often drawn ending of opposite colored bishops. Kasparov's 38.a4 forced the bishop away from the b5 square and allowed the passed pawn to collect the win.

Kasparov's game against Caruana was what everyone was waiting for, a closed Sicilian that developed into a tense positional battle, that eventually threw both players into time trouble. Despite 12 years of absence from chess, Kasparov was able to blitz out the last dozen or so moves to checkmate Caruana with the trio of bishop, knight and rook. All the drama is found in the following clip:

Wrapping Up
After the tournament, Kasparov confirmed our suspicions surrounding their motives for participating in this tournament. Kasparov participated in the St. Louis Blitz and Rapid in gratitude to: The Grand Chess Tour, to St. Louis, to the Chess Club and Scholastic Center, and to the man, Rex Sinquefield for creating such a culture. They went on to say they are happy to see St. Louis be the chess capitol of America, and wants to see it become the chess capital of the World!
Congrats to Levon Aronian for winning the St. Louis Rapid and Blitz. I was very nervous for them going into the last day. Karjakin was on fire, scoring 8/9 the previous day, and winning their first two games on the last day.
Does anyone else love the way Karjakin moves their pieces? It reminds me of that crane game where you're trying to get the teddy bear.
Aronian mentioned they hadn't slept well the night before and quickly drew their first game. The tide seemed to be turning. But Aronian regained their composure and won the tournament with 2 rounds to spare! Congrats!
Thanks to all the great people at the Chess Club and Scholastic Center in St. Louis, thanks to lichess.org, thanks to arex for editing, grandmasterjunio for making the Kasparov Study, and thanks to Garry Kasparov for giving chess fans the thrill of a lifetime!
VICTORVILLE (CBSLA.com) – A Norwalk man has been arrested on accusations they robbed and violently killed a 62-year-old woman Sunday evening at their Victorville store during a swap meet.
Chong Suk Hong of Victorville was attacked at around 5:42 p.m. while working at Xtreme Menswear, a store they co-owns located in the Victorville Galleria at 14560 Palmdale Rd., according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
Hong was rushed by ambulance to a hospital with critical injuries, where they were pronounced dead just after 6:30 p.m.
The suspect, 29-year-old Tom Raymond, was detained at the scene by mall security.
Investigators believe Raymond entered the store, robbed Hong and stabbed them several times, SBSD said. Authorities have no evidence that Raymond knew Hong or had been in their store prior to the attack, the sheriff's department said.
Raymond was booked into the High Desert Detention Center early Monday morning on murder charges.
NEW BRITAIN, CT—Explaining that the article did not meet the publication's high standards, the editors of The Recorder, Central Connecticut State University's student newspaper, confirmed Wednesday that the inaccuracy of every single detail forced them to pull the issue's top story at the last minute. “We at The Recorder strive to ensure that every piece of writing we publish contains timely and thoroughly reported information, and because each sentence of this article contains at least one factual error, we made the call to kill it,” said editor-in-chief Hannah Lowry, noting numerous “red flags” in the article that included an incorrect date and location; misattributed quotes; several wide-of-the-mark figures, including the school's attendance; and the names of students, faculty, and buildings that do not exist. “While I was confident in the story's reporting after my first pass, a closer inspection earlier today revealed that the piece as a whole does not contain a single accurate statement, and the headline referred to a campus event that never occurred. It was with this knowledge that I made the decision to pull the story from publication, ensuring that we uphold the paramount responsibilities entrusted to us by the Blue Devil community.” At press time, the student reporter who authored the article had reportedly apologized to the staff and attributed the errors to extreme fatigue.

The decision to rebrand the Canadian Forces touched off a Royal ruckus of sorts last year as National Defence went about extending the name change to the military's smaller branches, documents suggest.
Restoring the "Royal" prefix to the navy and air force has since become a huge point of pride for the Harper government, which billed the move as one that would help today's soldiers, sailors and aircrew connect with their storied history.
One year later, a series of briefing notes prepared for the country's top military commanders show that subordinate commands – the smaller subsets of the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Canadian Army – are next.

But it's not as simple as new business cards and stationery.
Each designation must meet with the Queen's approval, something that takes protocol and paperwork. The latest round of recommendations have already been forwarded to Buckingham Palace.
Prior to the unification of the Forces in 1968, each branch of the military maintained its own separate engineers, logisticians and signallers. They're combined now, with each branch contributing people to the pooled system.
The Canadian Army was never designated "Royal," but was eager to re-adopt the prefix for many of its sub-commands, including engineers, signallers and logisticians. But the documents show the move was considered "divisive and a potential threat" to unity if their air force and navy counterparts were excluded.
It was seen as point of tension and "controversy," said the analysis, dated Oct. 13, 2011. Lt.-Gen. Peter Devlin was urged to consult other commanders to smooth the way.
Despite three days of requests, National Defence refused to comment on the documents. But Defence Minister Peter MacKay said earlier this week they believe the designation has been "warmly embraced" by those in uniform.
"It has long been associated with the Canadian Forces since our inception, but it has also been warmly embraced by veterans, by Canadians far and wide, and it was well received within the Commonwealth," MacKay said.

"I suspect the Queen themselves was quite happy."
The army chose to drop the antiseptic-sounding Land Forces Command and returned to its roots as simply the Canadian Army.
The artillery and armoured corps were eager to designate themselves as "Royal" once again, documents show. In fact, the tank branch never stopped informally referring to itself in the traditional sense and gunners petitioned years ago for permission to restore their connection to the monarchy.
The military's seemingly single-minded focus on being associated with the monarchy may strike Canadians – especially younger ones who've grown up with modern multiculturalism – as a bit odd, or even unimportant.
But in an interview last winter, the commander of the Royal Canadian Navy said the attraction rests in tradition and being able to connect with one's roots.
Vice-Admiral Paul Maddison likened the 1960s homogenization of military designations to taking away a person's name and referring to them as: "Hey you."
Story continues below advertisement
Maddison conceded they aren't sure how last year's decision would play.
"I was a little hesitant about the younger sailors and how it would resonate with them," they said, "(but), it resonated extremely well. So I'm really pleased by the effect it has had."
Ironically, it was the navy that acted as a major catalyst in the decision to distance the Canadian military from the monarchy in the first place.
Following the Second World War, many Canadian sailors were unhappy with the harsh disciplinary standards and no-nonsense attitude of their officers, many of whom had trained with the British Royal Navy.
In the span of three weeks in the winter of 1949, three Canadian warships were struck with mutinies, where crew members refused to obey orders.
A resulting inquiry – the Mainguy Commission – found that the "absence of a distinguishing Canadian identity" was among the factors. A little more than a decade later, the Liberal government amalgamated the Forces in a radical overhaul that stripped each branch of its identity.
Story continues below advertisement
"We did move away from that relationship with the Royal Navy from a cultural perspective," said Maddison.
"We are not the navy of 1949. We are not the navy of 1989. This was not about a desire to get closer to Nelson and Jellicoe, Cunningham and the Royal Navy. And it wasn't about becoming closer to the Crown. What this was about, as uniquely Canadian, as a treasured institution, reconnecting with that thread that goes back to 1910, and restoring a name."
Presidential incapacity in a 70-year-old man will never be out of the question.

Perhaps President Trump will govern like a genius and manage to fulfill in some measure their campaign pledge to Make America Great Again. Or perhaps our worst fears will be realized and bizarre behavior will become impossible to ignore. If we reach that point, an important question will become: Even if Trump does not commit high crimes or misdemeanors, can they be removed from the presidency?
In drafting the Constitution, our Founding Fathers spent much more time contemplating how to select a president than how to get rid of one. The Succession Clause in Article II specifies that in the case of a president's “inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office,” their powers devolve to the vice president. The framers left it to Congress to work out further details.
Only after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, when concerns were raised about the advanced age of those in the line of succession, was the matter clarified through the enactment of the Constitution's 25th Amendment. It sets up two paths for dealing with an incapacitated president who cannot or chooses not to declare themselves unfit. The determination could be made by the vice president together with “a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments,” or by some “other body as Congress may by law provide.”
It might seem churlish to bring this up now, but not terribly long ago, we were in a phase of perpetual astonishment at how someone with so many obvious signs of narcissistic personality disorder and impulse control disorder could come so far.
Even those favorably disposed toward Trump were expressing fears about their equilibrium. “Our candidate is mental! Do you realize our candidate is mental?” is what Ann Coulter had to say about Trump back in March. “When you act as if you're insane, people are liable to think you're insane,” wrote Peggy Noonan in The Wall Street Journal in August. In the same newspaper just this month, The Weekly Standard's Andrew Ferguson, while holding open the possibility of a “successful presidency,” worried that “unfortunately, the candidate who campaigned as a sociopath shows signs they may yet govern as one.”
Some of those signs — more properly, symptoms — remain manifest. “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love!” Thanks to tweets like that, doubts about Trump's mental stability have never gone away. Their preoccupation with their “many enemies,” coupled with their claim that the intelligence community has been engaged in a “witch hunt” against him— “something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do” — suggest elevated levels of paranoia particles in their cerebrum.
The verdict on Trump's mental status, of course, will be out for some time. And it's conceivable that there is more method than madness here: The tweets and other headline grabbers could be well-calculated diversions in the service of an objective not yet apparent to those Trump watchers who do not comprehend their tactical brilliance. On the other hand, Trump's flabbergasting stream-of-consciousness address to the CIA suggests some degree of detachment from reality.
However close we are to a problem, presidential incapacity in a 70-year-old man will never be out of the question. It has certainly been an issue in America's past, mostly from physical causes.
In 1813 James Madison was laid low by a fever — probably from malaria — that kept them critically ill for three weeks. When James Garfield was shot by an assassin in 1881, they lingered near death for 79 days before succumbing to their wounds. In the worst episode of presidential disability, Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated by a stroke that was kept hidden from the public for a staggering 519 days.
Dwight Eisenhower had a massive heart attack in 1955, and then a stroke in 1957 that left them briefly unable to speak. Eisenhower acted responsibly and drafted a letter, made public at the time, giving Vice President Nixon the power to decide whether to assume presidential power if they were again incapacitated and could not communicate.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
In the post-25th Amendment era, the issue resurfaced most dramatically with the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan while Vice President George H.W. Bush was incommunicado on an airplane. That's when Secretary of State Alexander Haig blurted out their notorious — and notoriously incorrect — pronouncement: “As of now, I am in control here, in the White House.”
But incapacitation by insanity is not something we have much experience with. Perhaps the closest we came is in 1974, as the Watergate scandal was closing in on Nixon, when they began drinking heavily and close aides worried about their mental status. The 25th Amendment was not invoked, yet Defense Secretary James Schlesinger violated the chain of command and ordered the military to intercept all emergency orders, especially any involving nuclear weapons, and convey them to them or to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for clearance.
None of these precedents but the last is pertinent to the situation we'd face if President Trump went off their Oval Office rocker. Though it is impossible to forecast how such a dangerous scenario would play out, we do know this: “25th Amendment” would be the two words on everyone's lips.

A pedestrian was hit and killed by a Barnstable police cruiser early Sunday morning. A police spokesperson confirmed that an adult male was hit while walking in the road on Route 28 in the Centerville section of Barnstable at about 2 a.m. The officer was responding to a call with lights and siren activated and a civilian car pulled off to the right to get out of the way. Moments later, state police said the cruiser hit the man, who was walking on the double-yellow line in the center of the road. The pedestrian was not in a designated crosswalk, state police said. Red paint left behind by the collision analysis and reconstruction team marks dots the road and crosses the center lines. The officer who was driving the cruiser was taken to the hospital to be treated for glass in their eye, according to police. The pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene. The crash is under investigation by the Barnstable Police Department and Massachusetts State Police.

Dave Bona waited 20 years for a chance to tell Canadian MPs about the plight of soldiers like themselves suffering for years from harmful side-effects of the anti-malaria drug mefloquine.
This week, Bona, who lives near Saskatoon, will travel to Ottawa and present their case to the standing committee on veterans affairs along with three medical experts and three other soldiers who suffer mefloquine side-effects, which include nightmares, paranoia, aggression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
Bona was surprised Veterans Affairs Minister Kent Hehr finally opened the door to the mefloquine issue at the standing committee. For years, successive federal governments have refused to address the long-term side-effects among soldiers who took the controversial drug. About 15,677 took the drug between 2001 and 2012; more than a 1,000 others took it in the 1990s.
“I am going to draw attention to the hardest thing to talk about — the depression and suicidal thoughts that can come with mefloquine,” said Bona, a former Canadian Airborne soldier who first took the drug on the ill-fated 1992-93 Somalia mission and later in Rwanda.
Some soldiers say mefloquine side-effects played a role in the beating death of a Somali teenager by two Canadian soldiers on that mission. Soldiers' parents have also raised questions around mefloquine's role in the suicides of soldiers from the Van Doos regiment.
Bona fell ill with nausea and seizures after their first dose of mefloquine. For years, they have been plagued by depression, explosive anger and suicidal thoughts — symptoms that did not respond to years of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
In 2013, the American military put tighter restrictions on use of the drug. That's when the U.S Food and Drug Administration upgraded its warning to the highest level, after research showed some side-effects could be permanent.
The U.S. military reclassified mefloquine as a drug of last resort and banned it among special forces such as the green berets.
After an inquiry last year, the U.K. government restricted its use and set up a special contact point for soldiers concerned they are suffering long-term mefloquine side-effects.
Bona says Canada should get in step with those two allies.
 They are also worried soldiers who may be sent to Africa for peacekeeping will be at risk if Canada does not designate it as a drug of last resort.
According to the Department of Defence, mefloquine use has dropped significantly in recent years, with just six per cent of Canadian soldiers heading to countries with malaria taking mefloquine in 2012.
As recently as Aug. 25, Bona received a letter from Hehr noting their department does not prescribe drugs and referred to Health Canada, which continues to classify mefloquine as “a first line anti-malarial drug.”
“A review of scientific literature has shown that there are no long term effects from taking mefloquine,” Hehr said in the August letter.
That statement is surprising and troubling to Dr. Remington Nevin, who will also testify at the standing committee this week.
Hehr's department is relying on “out of date research” from Health Canada, which has not updated its warnings since 2011, says Nevin, a former U.S. military physician whose groundbreaking research shows the drug can cause long-term or even permanent adverse effects.
“We now know, for instance, you should to stop taking the drug as soon as you experience nightmares or vivid dreams as they are a sign of susceptibility to long-term problems. But Canadian soldiers won't be getting that medical advice,” said Nevin, who testified last year at the U.K. inquiry into mefloquine.
Dr. Greg Passey, a former Canadian military psychiatrist, will also testify at the hearings — years after they tried to raise the issue at the 1994 Somalia inquiry. The Liberal government halted the inquiry just before the use of mefloquine was to be examined.
“We are aware mefloquine can cause suicide ideation,” Passey said in an interview.
“The difficulty is mefloquine toxicity symptoms overlap with PTSD and it is difficult to tease apart,” they said.
The committee, which is looking into mental health in the armed forces, is scheduled to hear the mefloquine evidence Tuesday afternoon and Thursday.

We have a German World Champion. We have a German Constructors' Champion. Next year, we will have a German driver in each of the three factory teams: Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault. We have a new young German hotshot on the rise. But we won't have a German Grand Prix.
The race has long been one of the core events of the Formula One World Championship, but in fact it has been a major event on the international sporting calendar since 1926 and there have been only a few years when the event could not take place. In 1955 it disappeared as a result of the dreadful accident at Le Mans, which had killed more than 100 spectators. In 2007 there was political fighting, but there was still a race in Germany, under the European GP title, and in 2015 the Nürburgring failed to honour the terms of the contract with Formula One World Championship Ltd.
How does any of this make sense? How does F1 intend to cash in on German enthusiasm for the sport, if the sport does not go to Germany? Yes, Germans can drive across the border in their camper vans to go to Spa or Austria, as they used to do in the days of Michael Schumacher, but German F1 fans seem to have little interest these days. Whether that is because the ticket prices are too high or because they cannot get excited about Nico Rosberg, Sebastian Vettel, Nico Hulkenberg and Pascal Wehrlein is an interesting discussion. Michael Schumacher was the catalyst for Germany to become a leading nation in F1 in the 1990s. It was not simply because they were so successful, but also because of some hard-to-define sociological undercurrent in the German working classes, which identified Schumacher with national pride and confidence at a time when the country was going through the difficult and destablising process of reunification. Perhaps one day academics will properly define that impact, but there is no doubt that Michael was bigger than the sport and German GPs were engulfed by waves of new fans.
The Commercial Rights Holder will tell you that the race is off the calendar because no-one wanted to pay for it. This is true. In part it is because the fees are expensive and in part, in the case of the Nürburgring, because the Rhineland-Pfalz state government got itself into an awful mess over the circuit, agreeing to match private funding in an expansion project in 2009 that aimed to turn the track into a year-round tourist and business destination. The problem was that the private money never arrived and so the politicians were left with a half-finished project that they then had to completein order to avoid claims that they had wasted public money. Alas, the finished result was a complete waste of money and the Nürburgring went bankrupt and the asset was sold to Russian in what amounted to a fire sale. This was followed by European Commission investigation into anti-competitive behaviour for providing the circuit with too much funding.
The state president Kurt Beck had to resign as a result of the shenanigans at the Ring. They were replaced by Malu Dreyer, but their coalition refused to provide any funding to the new owner. That is not going to change any time soon as Dreyer's hold on power is tenuous and they cannot afford to make any mistakes after only just winning a no-confidence vote this summer (52-49). It clearly does not help that corporate Germany is not interested in being linked to Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone since their legal troubles in Germany in 2014. They were not found guilty, but nor was they ruled to be innocent and that is a problem. To be fair, Mr E is also not much bothered about being nice to Germans after that whole affair. There is further legal action going on at the moment which will bring the story back into the newspapers again next summer, with a six-week trial scheduled for next June at the High Court in London, as German bank BayernLB and Ecclestone try to work out whether the latter is liable for damages in connection to the sale of its shares in the Formula One group 10 years ago. This is not what the sport needs, but it seems to be a personal issue rather than one that involves the business. Nonetheless, it is all bad publicity.
There was a contract in place for the German GP to take place this year at the Nürburgring, but the Russian owner has little interest and no money to fulfil the terms of the contract. The Hockenheim track is planning to host the race again in 2018 (as contracted), but after that the contract is finished (as the 2019 race was due at the Nürburgring) and a new deal will need to be negotiated. One might imagine that Mercedes-Benz might be rather keen to see a German GP and might even be willing to pay for one, but it seems that the Formula One group is not keen for a manufacturer to agree to cover any losses incurred by a race promoter. As I understand it, Mercedes-Benz was offered the chance to pay the Formula One group directly, in exchange for trackside signage and VIP hospitality, on the basis that this would then lead to a reduction in the fees being asked, but it seems that the Stuttgart firm was not very keen on that proposal, presumably because of the rules of corporate governance in Germany.
Whatever the case, the lack of a German GP is not good for the sport and while explicable, it is not logical.
Lord Triesman, a former general secretary of the party, said the human rights lawyer should have declined the honour as it came so soon after their "woeful" report into anti-Semitism in Labour.
Mr Corbyn sparked a row last August after nominating Ms Chakrabarti for a peerage in David Cameron's resignation honours list.
They have repeatedly insisted that it had nothing to do with their inquiry, which was dismissed as a "whitewash" by critics when it was published just a month before.
But speaking to The House magazine, Lord Triesman, who is Jewish, said they should have turned it down to avoid giving the impression that their inquiry had been compromised.
They said: "I've never spent my life going out looking for anti-Semitism, but I do see really quite serious examples of it in the party.
"I don't believe for a second that Jeremy Corbyn is a racist, but the Chakrabarti report is woeful. It doesn't understand that some forms or racism are distinct from others. The ways in which people evoke it are very particular, so the Chakrabarti report saying ‘there's no big problem, it's all overcome by having a general view of racism' fails to deal with the specifics.
"It's woefully inadequate. Then the question arises about whether it's wise for somebody who has been through a process like that to accept a place in the House of Lords and on the frontbench. It really does create a view that it's too neat an outcome around too difficult a problem.
"I think that many people, if they were offered a peerage in those circumstances, if there was something behind it or not, would have said 'not at this moment'. I think I would have said perceptions can be very damaging to a politician, it doesn't matter if they're grounded in reality or not.
"She could have relied on the fact that given their work and their reputation they would have arrived in the House of Lords eventually."
Elsewhere, Lord Triesman - who also served as a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - warned that Labour was heading for a "big defeat" at the next election.
"I think the position for the party is genuinely very grim and I don't see any real point in trying to hide from the reality," they said. "Winning a majority in the party, as Jeremy did, is not anything like winning a majority in the country. It's a completely different task and it's a task that requires us not to follow where the middle ground is in a blind and ill-considered way, but to understand what the aspirations are of people right across the UK and develop policies that are capable of gratifying those wishes.
"I'd like to believe that the people who believe that our prospects are not good will start doing the hard work on policy that we ought to be doing, in a way that reflects what is of interest in their constituencies. They'll know perfectly well that this doctrinaire stuff is of zero interest to their constituents."
Story Highlights Jerry Lohmann suffered apparent heart attack
They were pronounced dead at West Boca Medical Center
BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) — A South Florida high school football referee has died after collapsing on the field during a preseason game.
The Palm Beach Post reports that Jerry Lohmann suffered an apparent heart attack during the second quarter of the Friday night game at Olympic Heights High School.
An assistant coach for the visiting team administered CPR to the 73-year-old referee, who was then carted off the field on a stretcher. Yetta Greene, athletic director of the Palm Beach County School District, says Lohmann was then transported to West Boca Medical Center, where they later died.
Officials say Lohmann was a longtime referee in the Western Communities Football League and had been scheduled to work a game Saturday.

President is not a natural Reagan Republican and healthcare reform has failed – but many top activists applaud their approach to power and deregulation
Donald Trump may not look like a conservative, act like a conservative or sound like a conservative, but they have been governing like one.
Many Republican activists are satisfied with the first 70 days of their administration. In conversations with such figures this week, issues such as Trump's controversial travel bans or the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn did not come up. Instead, optimism centered around efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations and the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacant supreme court seat.
Grover Norquist, a long-time and vocal activist, leader of Americans for Tax Reform, said: “On the deregulatory front he's been phenomenal.” Trump's picks to staff their administration, Norquist said, were “all people who understand the costs of the regulatory burden and are committed to ruling back the over-regulations of both George W Bush and Obama”.

This was echoed by Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union. Their organization, they said, was “really happy with the team [Trump has] put around themselves and the executive orders he's been rolling out”.
Norquist said that while Trump's “background isn't Reagan Republican” they thought the 45th president had come around to that mindset “whether by instinct or what he's learned”.
They noted that while Trump, a former Democratic donor who has promised spending on infrastructure and health “insurance for everybody”, had come to that position by a slightly unusual path – “he talks about ‘jobs, jobs, jobs' and not ‘liberty, liberty, liberty'” – they had produced a conservative result.
“His answers were all conservative even if their phrasing appeared to be populist,” said Norquist.
It also helped, Norquist said, that Trump ran for president against Hillary Clinton, who they said was the antithesis of Reagan Republicanism. The result was that if Trump was against everything the former secretary of state was for, they had no choice but to be a Reagan Republican. This process had been amplified, Norquist said, by Trump's rejection by “the establishment left … whose job it is to seduce you when it comes to DC”.
Schlapp argued that Trump is more conservative than they seem. In their opinion skeptics on the right have not been paying attention.
“I think they didn't listen,” they said, “and they didn't take Trump seriously and they didn't spend time with them and when you spend time with him, they have conservative instincts.
“I believe Barack Obama had a big impact on him,” Schlapp added, saying that “people who were less partisan thought Obama presidency was a great chance for our country to bridge the divide”.
“A lot of Republicans who I know who voted for Obama thought that actually they might find this third way and find a way to bridge partisan divide and I think what people saw with Obama was a very aggressive liberal agenda and I think there was a backlash to Obama.”
Furthermore, Schlapp said, a robust conservative movement always provides strong guardrails on executive appointments made by Republican administrations. Trump's selection of Gorsuch, for example, came from a list of potential supreme court picks that their campaign worked up with the Heritage Foundation, a prominent think tank that has influenced other moves by the Trump administration.
‘Legislation is harder'
Despite all the steps taken through executive orders and White House support for congressional efforts to overturn rules instituted by Obama in their final months in office, Trump is without actual legislative success. The failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), the proposed replacement for Obamacare, hit hard.
After the AHCA was pulled, finger-pointing ensued across the Republican party. Some blamed Speaker Paul Ryan and House leadership; others blamed the hard-right Freedom Caucus, whose refusal to back the bill was an important factor in its collapse. But no blame was cast towards Trump directly. Supporters and opponents of the bill went out of their way to praise the president's involvement.

“Legislation is obviously a lot of work, a lot of detail, a lot of titles and a lot of legal interpretation and so it's just harder,” said Schlapp, a veteran of the George W Bush White House, in discussing the work involved in passing a bill compared with that of naming a political appointee.
Some House Republicans, Schlapp said, were frustrated that they could not improve the process of pushing the AHCA into law.
Norquist, though, laid the blame for the AHCA's fall on the Freedom Caucus, who they called “the Know Nothing caucus”. Such hard-right figures, they said, felt Trump was stealing their spotlight.
Their objection “appears to be the same that some conservatives had to [former speaker] Newt Gingrich”, they said: “That they suck all the oxygen out of the room and Gingrich is always taking everyone's ideas and massaging them and making them their own.”
Although Trump has been aggressive on Twitter towards the Freedom Caucus, they have shrugged such shots aside. One member, Justin Amash of Michigan, tweeted on Friday of the AHCA: “Didn't vote for #Swampcare because it's just another version of #Obamacare – and just as dysfunctional (which is pretty hard to pull off).”
Norquist said: “I'm not surprised by … the odd reactions by some people who want to be Mr Conservative if the president is always sitting in that spot.”
‘He lacks both character and judgment'
Trump's work on appointments and deregulation have not appeased all conservatives. Bill Kristol, founder of the the Weekly Standard and former chief of staff to Vice-President Dan Quayle, told the Guardian: “Trump's pretty much been as bad as I expected.”
Kristol, who was a “Never Trump” Republican in 2016, said that while Trump has “done some individually good things … they lack both the character and judgment as well as the qualifications for the job and lacks most conservative policies or principles”.

While Trump had some legitimate conservative accomplishments, they said, “some of it depends on how you weight some decent policy choices … against real irresponsibility in certain respects on foreign policy and general disregard for constitutional and institutional norms”.
Furthermore, Kristol said, every move for which Trump is being praised by conservatives would have been done by any other Republican president. Trump is effectively being graded on a curve.
To Kristol, the ongoing controversies surrounding Russia and investigating claims of wiretapping were “getting into Watergate and Iran-Contra territory”. And they added, “it's just one thing”.
However, such concerns have yet to concern many conservatives. Although Trump's approval rating is mired at historic lows for a newly elected president, under 40%, they have loyal support among the rank and file: in one recent poll, 84% of self-identified Republicans supported him.
As Schapp pointed out, at CPAC in February, an event that was a center of disdain for Trump in 2016, attendees were almost universally happy with the president.
“They're really happy with what they're seeing with the Trump administration,” said Schapp, whose organization hosts the annual conservative conference. “His agenda and the president are held in high esteem.”
After all, the Trump administration is shrinking the size of government – or, as adviser Steve Bannon put it at CPAC, “deconstructing the administrative state”. Despite the troubles and controversies that dog the president, that is still what is most important to many on the right.
The fear of a Donald Trump presidency is not only affecting people in America – it has officially reached Copenhagen, Denmark, the capital of the happiest country in the world.

BONUS: Obama laughs 'most of the time' Trump is on the debate stage
The Associated Press Monday released new guidelines for referencing the "alt-right," which ask that journalists use the term alongside its definition and in context of its association with racist beliefs.

The new guidelines read:
"'Alt-right' (quotation marks, hyphen and lower case) may be used in quotes or modified as in the 'self-described' or 'so-called alt-right' in stories discussing what the movement says about itself. Avoid using the term generically and without definition, however, because it is not well known and the term may exist primarily as a public-relations device to make its supporters' actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience."
The new guidelines come after criticism of media outlets by some observers who view the term has having "normalized" President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's nationalistic rhetoric and that of some Trump supporters. Specifically, many object to the term's use alongside senior adviser Stephen Bannon, whose hiring was applauded by neo-Nazi and KKK groups.
Bannon has described Breitbart News, their former outlet, as "the platform of the alt-right."
The new reference went on to say that, "in the past (The AP) have called such beliefs racist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist."

Silverstone will feature on the 2018/19 FIA World Endurance Championship schedule after all, following the release of a revised ‘Super Season' schedule on Friday that also eliminates the date clash with Petit Le Mans.
The famed British circuit takes up the to-be-announced date, originally scheduled for February 2019, which has been moved to Aug. 18-19, 2018, as the first post-Le Mans round.
It will result in five races in the 2018 calendar year, but remaining with an eight-round total season.
The addition of Silverstone comes after failed talks with promoters in Mexico City, which have elected not to continue the Six Hours of Mexico for a third season, with a return to Interlagos also reportedly not materializing.
The Fuji Speedway race, originally scheduled for Oct. 14, meanwhile, has been moved back by one week to avoid a clash with the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season finale at Road Atlanta.
A number of competitors had voiced concern over the initial clash, which had compromised several drivers' planned programs for IMSA's four-race Tequila Patron North American Endurance Cup.
The date for the Shanghai race has also been adjusted to provide the required time between the two Asian rounds, for shipping purposes.
The revised WEC schedule is expected to be approved at the next FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on Sept. 21.
2018/19 WEC Schedule (Revised):
May 4-5 — Spa-Francorchamps
June 16-17 — 24 Hours of Le Mans
Aug. 18-19 — Silverstone
Oct. 20-21 — Fuji Speedway
Nov. 17-18 — Shanghai
March 15-16 – Twelve Hours of Sebring
May 3-4 – Spa-Francorchamps
June 15-16 – 24 Hours of Le Mans
Tensions are creeping into the France camp, with the players involved in a "heated" bust-up after their 2-0 defeat by Sweden and Chelsea's Florent Malouda, dropped after the opening draw with England, has been among the most outspoken.
France, who were hit by internal strife at the 2010 World Cup, capitulated against the Swedes on Tuesday and would have lost more heavily if the goalkeeper Hugo Lloris had not made several saves.
Although the defeat did not prevent them from advancing to a quarter-final against Spain, the manner of it exasperated the coach, Laurent Blanc, and senior players such as Malouda.
"Yes, it got a bit heated, but then everyone had a cold shower," Blanc said. "It shows that there was a bit of electricity. I hope there will be against Spain, because we'll need it."
Malouda chose not to speak to the media after the defeat as they were afraid of what they might say.  They are France's most experienced player and was part of the World Cup squad that shocked a nation by going on strike at training two years ago after Nicolas Anelka was sent home.
"What I saw awoke some demons in me and I didn't want to express myself," they said. "Because in the heat of the moment there was the risk of launching rockets and missiles. There are some things to sort out and sometimes you can really hurt someone with a comment that you make."
But with tempers frayed and pride dented after a shambolic performance against a Sweden team with nothing to play for, some of the players could not hold back when they got to the sanctuary of the dressing room.
Of the dressing room disagreement they said: "Sometimes you need to aim a few bursts of gunfire at each other .
"We said quite a few things to each other in the changing room, which is a good thing as it's proof that we have temperament and character.
"Balance is fragile and when you start thinking you're at the Euro to shine individually then the wheels can start to come off. You pay very dearly for every error at a Euro. There are personal objectives and then there are collective objectives."
The possible target of those comments was the Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri, no stranger to squad bickering after their infamous fall-out with their former Arsenal and France team-mate William Gallas. Malouda made clear reference to Nasri, and also suggested that France were heading for a hiding in their quarter-final against Spain on Saturday night if they did not improve on Tuesday's display.
"In modern football and especially against Spain, who have an extraordinary control of the ball, you have to run a lot but you also have to be disciplined. They create space and they make such intelligent runs that they will find a weakness.
"It's difficult to point fingers at people after a defeat in terms of how they played or their personal objectives. Samir's way of playing hasn't changed overnight but that's also one of their qualities. They scored an important goal against England. But as an experienced player I can say that there is a balance to be found between the team and your personal objectives.
"But it's in these moments that you shouldn't point the finger at people, it's at times like this that you really need to have a discussion between the players. If we don't sort things out before Saturday, with the opponent that's coming up, the defeat could be heavy."
Malouda was overlooked in favour of Jérémy Ménez, who scored in the win over Ukraine, but was then replaced by Hatem Ben Arfa in the defeat to Sweden.
"I will keep my feelings to myself but of course I was disappointed to be dropped after the England game," added Malouda. "I can bring things to this team, so of course I'm disappointed because I think I have my place in this team.
"It's more in terms of the attitude that you give off and what you bring to this team. It's a top tournament and if we had shown the same attitude as the Swedes we wouldn't have woken up with a hangover. We weren't up to it in terms of our attitude. This is one of the things we have to correct.
'We're not here to take a stroll in our flip-flops. We're here to play matches and win them. In terms of commitment you can't go below a certain level. If we get back to old ways we go backwards. You have to be demanding at this level. Every player has to think about yesterday's game and take things on board, it's not up to the coach or one player to say something that switches everyone else on."
The Arsenal centre-half Laurent Koscielny, who will replace the suspended Philippe Mexès against Spain, confirmed that an argument took place. "We were below par on every level," Koscielny said. "When we got back to the dressing room we knew we hadn't performed as we should have done and some things were said … things that will stay between us."
Having a chat with Gene Haas is quite a rare occasion for us, yet it's always a great pleasure. We've caught up with the owner of Haas Automation and Haas Formula 1 Team in Barcelona to hear their thoughts on some of the current issues in the sport.
Gene, what role does Formula 1 play in your life at the moment?
Formula 1 is obviously a very high-tech business that incorporates advanced materials, advanced manufacturing and advanced machining. Those are all the things that we need to be aware of going forward in the machine tool business and it's what we're focused on.
So this is your second year in Formula 1. Have any of the methodologies that you've seen employed in Formula 1 been applied to what you're doing at Haas Automation in Oxnard, California?
I think it kind of opens my eyes to how advanced some of the European manufacturing is, especially in areas of 3D, five-axis work. They have a lot of technologies that, to be honest with you, I wasn't aware of how large they'd become. Especially in advanced technologies like aircraft, space systems and medical. I actually think Formula 1's even more advanced in terms of technology than them, but it's good to be in something that's at the forefront of technology so you can look at it.
After the first season in 2016, were there any strategic changes that you made in the way the team would operate in 2017?
I think one thing we've learned is that it seems like the competition in 2017 is tenser than in 2016. From a strategic standpoint, I think we've been trying as hard as we can to come up with a better car and better results. We've scored eight points, but that's not as many points as we had last year at this time.
Have you noticed changes in terms of Formula 1's popularity in America and amongst our fans, be it NASCAR fans or racing fans in general, since you've gotten into Formula 1?
I certainly think there's more awareness of Formula 1, especially since Liberty Media took it over. You have this new leadership with a lot of ideas. They're putting them out there, they're talking about new races, new ways of getting the fans more involved and new media outlets. So there's a lot of talk about it, and it seems like you hear more about it.
Formula 1 is slowly gaining a bigger foothold in America, thanks to you as an American team. Are there other things that the sport can do to make the sport a little more mainstream in the United States?
I think the biggest thing they could do is to add another race. They've talked about that and I think it sounds like a certainty there'll be a race somewhere, whether it's Las Vegas, Los Angeles or New York. So I think that would certainly increase the popularity of it as would increase the media output. We all know people don't watch TV as much as they used to. There has to be some new ways of getting to the customer, and Liberty Media has put forth a number of ways that they intend to increase viewership through other outlets.
There's a lot of talk about Formula 1, and it seems like you hear more about it now. Gene Haas
You touched on adding races. Are you happy with the current Formula 1 schedule or would you like to see things added or changed?
I think the biggest problem is that the calendar is often decided by sporting events other than Formula 1. It seems to hopscotch all over the world, which is very difficult for teams. It would be nicer if races were clumped together so that it was more efficient for teams to go to the races. Maybe some of the races that are far away, you have them a week apart so you don't necessarily have to come back to your home or your place, to just then go to another place. That's probably just the biggest thing. It's really hard on the teams to fly halfway around the world to get to some of these races, then there's another one in another place. It just requires a lot of travel.
Where do you think the sport will be in five or more years in terms of technology?
I've seen the insides of these cars and they're really technological marvels. They're really farther ahead than people realise. The amount of work that goes into them, I mean, if you had to compare them, they're kind of like a racing Swiss watch in terms of the complexity. But even beyond that, there are these beautifully machined mechanical components that take huge amounts of horsepower and there are all kinds of sophisticated electronics, sensors and systems analysts.
Five years from now, with the rate they're going, it'll probably just keep progressing that way. It just seems like it gets more and more complicated every year, especially from the aero. Unfortunately, that complexity is also very expensive, so I think it gets to some point where someone says can you really afford all this technology going into these cars? I would hope that the technology continues but, at the same time, it does seem like it's somewhat extravagant in terms of how much you pay to put these cars together.
Is there a figure in sports, or a former or current team owner, who you've looked up to in terms of how you want to run Haas F1 Team?
I think every owner I've known that's owned a racing team is totally different. Rick Hendrick – he's the ultimate salesperson. They sell cars, that's how they run their operation. You get the Roger Penske racer person. They just loves racing. It's part of their business as it is part of mine – I'm on the manufacturing side of it. We're all unique and I don't think we can really emulate each other. We just do it because this is something that we enjoy doing. It's competitive and it gives you a reason to keep competing and coming up with ideas. I'm sure there's lots of people you can emulate, but we're just all so different.
