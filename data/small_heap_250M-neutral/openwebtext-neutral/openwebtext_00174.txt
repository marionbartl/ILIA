Three days before Christmas, 2013 I saw weird things in the sky. For three nights in a row. And on Christmas night I took a video of it for
the last time. It was from 4 am - 7:45 am. The lights would split apart,
and I saw two white lights shoot bright blue beams to each other. I was
thinking maybe they were communicating w/ each other, but I don't know
the reason for sure. But using my binoculars I could see the energy
exchange very good. Before I taped, I saw a bright white light like a dot
and it was moving as if it had a tail dancing really fast from it, like a candle flame when its moving, but this was bright white. I have no idea what that was...but I haven't seen it since. I always look out my 3rd floor window so that's why I notice these things.
Hillary Clinton laid out an extensive technology and innovation agenda Wednesday in a briefing document that amounts to a giant valentine to Silicon Valley.
That should come as no surprise, since Clinton has deep ties to Silicon Valley and has cultivated relationships with some of the industry's power players — people like LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, Salesforce.com's Marc Benioff, Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Kleiner Perkins' John Doerr.
While Clinton has been campaigning themselves hoarse in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, a high-powered group of advisers from Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., have been working behind the scenes for months to help shape their tech policy agenda for the general election.
Clinton's likely Republican rival for the White House, meanwhile, seems to have gone out of their way to antagonize the tech sector. Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple's products this spring, as the company fought its encryption battle with the FBI. They have repeatedly beaten on Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, warning that the owner of the Washington Post will face "huge anti-trust problems" should the Republican be elected president.
So, just how do Clinton's positions on issues like net neutrality, STEM education and broadband infrastructure compare with those of Trump?
Recode broke it down, they said / they said style:
A century ago hundreds of thousands of troops were killed and wounded as they fought for a tiny patch of land.
On Friday Prince Harry and Prince Charles joined a ceremony in Turkey to mark 100 years since the start of the Gallipoli campaign, one of the most famous battles of World War One.
Lasting eight months it pitted British, French, Indian, New Zealand, Australian and Canadian forces against the Ottoman Empire, or the Turkish Empire. The allies were eventually forced to withdraw.
Gallipoli, like the battles of the Western Front which ground on for four years, was supposed to be a decisive phase of combat.
Casualties are hard to estimate due to conflicting reports, but here are some approximate numbers Around 21,000 British empire troops were killed
Some 8,000 Australians
2,500 New Zealanders
55,000 to 85,000 Ottomans
After the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany, it was decided the empire should be knocked out of the war.
The plan was simple - sail a huge fleet up the narrow Dardanelles, a patch of water linking the Mediterranean up to Istanbul.
By capturing the Ottoman capital, the empire would be badly weakened, and perhaps even have to surrender.
The plan failed miserably. The fleet, was huge but badly outdated. Many of the ships were damaged or sunk by Ottoman cannons and mines, forcing them to retreat.
The allies made plans to invade by land instead - to capture the area and ensure the fleet could safely pass.
For the troops of New Zealand and Australia (the Anzac), it was to be their first battle.
The landings were a disaster. Thousands were killed on the first day and the front lines never moved more than a few hundred metres from the beach in eight months of fighting, attacks, fresh landings and counter attacks.
Conditions in the trenches were appalling. Constant shelling and snipers meant bodies piled up in no man's land, making the area a breeding ground for flies and disease.
The cramped front line meant there was no room for proper latrines, and water was scarce making the soldier's health problems even worse.
Amid the horrendous conditions, a strange bond grew between the enemies. In breaks in the shelling they would occasionally meet and exchange gifts, and there are stories of certain soldiers being allowed to hang out washing on the barbed wire without getting shot.
The allies were eventually forced to retreat in January 1916.
More than 100,000 troops were killed and hundreds of thousands more were wounded. But victory came at a terrible cost.
The allies turned their attention to invading the Middle East, taking control of modern day Iraq, Israel, Palestine and Syria.
As well as parades and ceremonies in Turkey to mark the fallen, 25 April is Anzac Day, a major public holiday in both Australia and New Zealand.
The countries had only been independent a few years before the outbreak of World War One, and Gallipoli was their first major contribution to world affairs.

If you had any doubt the US economy had been rearchitected to favor the haves versus the have-lesses, this chart by Pavlina Tcherneva should settle it. Justin Wolfers, hardly a raging liberal, just tweeted:
While the overall trend is dramatic enough, you can also see two major shifts: the big change with the Reagan era, with its higher-income and capital-favoring tax cuts, of the top 10% suddenly reaping vastly disproportionate gains relative to the rest of the distribution.
The Bush Administration, with even more changed in taxes that shifted income to the rich, is another big ratchet. But arguably the most dramatic change is under the Obama Adminstration, where the top echelon's gains came in part at the expense of everyone else.
Matt Stoller was early to notice this change. As they wrote in 2012:
A better puzzle to wrestle with is why President Obama is able to continue to speak as if their administration has not presided over a significant expansion of income redistribution upward. The data on inequality shows that their policies are not incrementally better than those of their predecessor, or that we're making progress too slowly, as liberal Democrats like to argue. It doesn't even show that the outcome is the same as Bush's. No, look at this table, from Emmanuel Saez (h/t Ian Welsh). Check out those two red circles I added. Yup, under Bush, the 1% captured a disproportionate share of the income gains from the Bush boom of 2002-2007. They got 65 cents of every dollar created in that boom, up 20 cents from when Clinton was President. Under Obama, the 1% got 93 cents of every dollar created in that boom. That's not only more than under Bush, up 28 cents. In the transition from Bush to Obama, inequality got worse, faster, than under the transition from Clinton to Bush. Obama accelerated the growth of inequality.
A bit hat tip to Pavlina, who has put this data together in a simple but powerful way that makes it hard to ignore how the rich really have gotten richer. And before you argue that this is the result of a technology (as opposed to rentier) driven transformation, please read the post yesterday, Is Rising Inequality Inevitable? Its conclusion: “Rising inequality is therefore not inevitable — it is a political choice.”

The kitchen of the future will be your interactive friend, helping you cook, shop and eat with optimum hygiene and efficiency.
And many of the technologies that will help us live this way are already here.
Smart fridges featuring wi-fi enabled tablet-style screens and barcode scanning technology can keep tabs on the foods they contain, including their use-by dates.
They can even suggest recipes based on what you have in stock and send all this information to your smartphone.
Most of our kitchen appliances are getting brainier, from the humble chopping block to the multifunction oven.
And as the "internet of things" gathers pace, it might not be too long before all our gadgets are talking wirelessly to each other as well.
Image caption The Chop-syc prototype is an interactive multifunction touch screen chopping board
Chop-syc is a multifunction interactive touchscreen chopping board created by product designer Siobhan Andrews.
Them prototype recently won the #GetItDownOnPaper competition for inventors. funded by Sharp Laboratories of Europe and Humans Invent.
It is a wi-fi enabled board that can weigh ingredients, suggest recipes and scale the quantities up or down according to the number of diners.
Ms Andrews said they wanted the board to "simplify healthy cooking".
Chop-syc can also add recipe ingredients to your online shopping list and place a supermarket order for you.
Toughened glass, coupled with the ability to reduce touchscreen sensitivity, means you can chop away to your heart's content without fear of damage.
"The health dimension was something that really attracted us," said Ian Thompson, managing director of Sharp Laboratories of Europe.
Image caption Nutrima, a wi-fi enabled bendy mat capable of measuring the weight and nutritional value of foods, was a finalist in the 2013 Electrolux Design Lab competition
Janne Palovuori, from Finland, was a finalist in the 2013 Electrolux Design Lab competition with their Nutrima food analysis mat prototype.
It can be charged by bending and then measures the weight, toxicity and nutritional value of ingredients placed on it, as well as helping you source local foods online.
As bendy screen technology develops, we will soon be able to slap this kind of interactive intelligent mat on any vertical or horizontal surface.
And it does not take a great leap of imagination to see how these intelligent gadgets will soon be sharing information with our intelligent fridges.
Fabrice Boutain's HAPIfork, launched this year, monitors how fast we eat in an attempt to get us to slow down. Eating too fast has been shown to contribute to obesity, because our sense of hunger and satiety lags behind the scoffing process.
Our eating habit data can be uploaded to a computer and displayed graphically.

'Precise temperatures'
Henrik Otto, Electrolux's vice-president of design, told the BBC: "There is still a lot of technology that hasn't become the everyday property of consumers, such as induction cooking."
It uses alternating electric current to produce an oscillating magnetic field that then heats up a ferromagnetic pan. It is a faster, more energy-efficient way to heat food than the traditional gas burner or electrically heated coil hobs.
"This allows for very precise temperatures," says Mr Otto.
The latest induction hobs include automatic pan recognition, which means the zone will only heat up once it has recognised that a typical saucepan shape has been placed on it.
This prevents smaller metal objects, such as spoons or bottle openers, getting hot if they are left on the induction zones.
But Mr Otto believes the technology could be applied more extensively.
Image caption Induction only heats the pan, not the surface
"What if your entire counter top or table incorporated induction technology?" they ask. "What if it could be used to power your other appliances?"
As populations grow and compact urban living becomes the norm, "rooms will have to morph throughout the day and our technology will have to multitask", they say.
"For example, a living room coffee table could also be an induction cooktop that then charges your laptop overnight."
Squidgy food
While we may still be a long way from Star Trek-style food replicators, lazy cooks and time-poor parents might take heart from a new invention from Barcelona start-up Natural Machines.

It has developed Foodini, a prototype 3D printer that can produce a range of foodstuffs, from chocolate to ravioli, from a number of ingredients, as long as they are squidgy.
Technically, this is piping, not printing, and the results are unlikely to win any prizes on MasterChef.
But the machine can combine up to six different ingredients from separate nozzles to create a potentially wide range of foods in precisely programmed shapes.
Nasa has been looking at similar technology to help provide more exciting mealtimes for astronauts on the International Space Station.
Image caption Natural Machines hopes its Foodini food printer will end up looking like this
Lynette Kucsma, the company's chief marketing officer, told the BBC: "We're looking for everyday foods you would eat, so savoury foods from ravioli to gnocchi... to decorating toast that you might have for breakfast."
Its makers envisage networked machines sharing culinary creations across social media, and workers being able to set them up in advance so that your food is ready for you when you arrive back home.
Chief executive Emilio Sepulveda thinks the Foodini will probably cost about 1,000 euros ($1,350; £833), although we are unlikely to see it in stores soon.
But as the networked digital kitchen comes closer, many of us are still waiting for the perfect gadget: an espresso maker equipped with voice biometrics.
Just one word and it will brew up the perfect, personalised coffee. Now that would be progress.
The female praying mantis is often painted as an evil seductress, a cannibalistic lover that lures males closer, only to eat them after mating. Is their reputation deserved? Does praying mantis sex always end in cannibalism of the male?
Female Mantis Shaming or Truth?
Rumors of the praying mantis' cannibalistic tendencies began when scientists observed their mating behavior in a laboratory environment. Entomologists would offer a captive female a potential mate and would quite often be horrified to watch the female bite the head or legs off the smaller male—sometimes even before mating. After the male had served their copulatory purpose, they were nothing more than a good meal for the female and their upcoming offspring. For a long time, these observations of praying mantis sex in the lab were thought to be the way things were in the mantid world.
Much Less Common in the Wild
After scientists started observing praying mantis sex in a natural setting, the story had a different ending, which is good for the males. When unconfined by laboratory terrariums (and not starving), the majority of praying mantis mating ends with the male flying off unharmed. By most estimates, sexual cannibalism by praying mantis females occurs less than 30 percent of the time outside the lab. Those are better odds for the fellows than what had been seen in the lab. Praying mantis sex, it turns out, is really a rather romantic series of courtship rituals and dances that typically ends satisfactorily and safely for both parties involved.
How Males Choose Females
Given a choice between females, male praying mantises will move toward females seen as less aggressive (i.e., ones they hadn't just seen eating another male) more often than the more aggressive females.
The males also tend to prefer to mate with females that appear fatter and more well fed than others, as the skinnier and hungrier mantises are more likely to eat their mates during or after sex. This could also point to the males being more attracted to females that are healthier, for the betterment of their offspring.
Advantages of Beheading Your Mate
There is a decided advantage for the female if they do decide to behead them lover. The praying mantis brain, located in their head, controls inhibition, while a ganglion in the abdomen controls the motions of copulation. Absent their head, a male praying mantis will lose all their inhibitions and consummate their relationship with wild abandon.
And what if she's hungry? For certain, a slow-moving and deliberate predator like the praying mantis is not going to pass up an easy meal. If a male makes the unfortunate choice of a hungry female for a mate, he's probably going to be toast after they've mated.
Either Way Could Benefit the Males
Delage 15 S8 by Raoul.W Reading time: about 1 minute. Art
Cars
Design
Delage was a French automaker that made a name for themselves building racing cars, before shifting to focus on luxury cars later in the company's life.
The engineering that went into the Delage Grand Prix cars was amongst the best in the world at the time, their two most famous engines were likely the V12 and straight-8 fitted to their Grand Prix cars of the 1920s. Both engines were staggeringly well designed for the time, featuring double overhead cams, 8000 rpm red lines, a horsepower figures from 110 right the way up to 195.
The Delage 15 S8 was so named because of it's engine, a supercharged, DOHC straight-8 with a capacity of 1488 cc and 170 bhp at 8000 rpm. With its feather-like kerb weight of 748 kilograms (1649 lbs), the Delage 15 S8 was an exceptionally quick car, and in 1927 it won the Spanish, Italian, French, and British Grands Prix – taking the championship win for the year.
The sculpture you see here is the work of famed artist Raoul.W. It's the 3rd in a series of 6 automotive sculptures they have planned on iconic 20th century racing cars. The Delage is constructed from 56 unique sections, each made from steel with a matte black epoxy finish. The wheels and tires have been built to give the illusion of movement, and it measures in at 147″ × 57″ × 40″.

The Washington Post highlighted new research demonstrating that pay disparities between men and women “start earlier in their careers than frequently assumed and have significantly widened” among college graduates in the past year. The research debunks a claim frequently promoted by right-wing media outlets that the obvious pay discrimination faced by millions of American women is the result of their personal and professional choices.
In an April 28 post for The Washington Post's Wonkblog, reporter Danielle Paquette highlighted research from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) and American Association of University Women (AAUW) demonstrating that pay disparities between men and women start as soon as students graduate from college, persist regardless of chosen career fields, and are actually worse for college graduates than for women with only a high school education. The research stands as yet more evidence against the misleading claim frequently pushed by conservative media outlets that the gender pay gap, if it exists at all, is actually the fault of women who pursue less lucrative professions and forgo career opportunities to have children and raise a family.

TM58 – S4E10 – The Beginning http://traffic.libsyn.com/thefringepodcast/uncaged58.mp3 It's Mike and Cory's last 12 Monkeys episode discussion ever for the series finale, “The Beginning”! What a great way to go out with a wonderful, thoughtful discussion filled with appreciation, speculation, and awe at how perfect everything was, topped off with some insightful, well-phrased feedback from the listeners. Like the show, the podcast got its perfect ending! Join us for 12 Monkeys news, commentary and analysis for “The Beginning”! This week we talk about Deacon's strange task in the past that we never got to see, Cole's wonderfully understated persuasion of Cassie, the endlessly entertaining reunion of Cole and Ramse, the surprises of other return cameos for other characters, and, of course, the stellar ending with two different epilogues. Just the ultimate series finale of all time! Read more…
TM57 – S4E9 – One Minute More http://traffic.libsyn.com/thefringepodcast/uncaged57.mp3 We marvel over the tightly-written 12 Monkeys penultimate episode, “One Minute More,” in which secrets are revealed that reach all the way back to season 1, but we also get plenty of shocking revelations from only the final season, such as whom the real demon is! With such a wonderful set up, how could the series finale be anything other than epic? Join us for 12 Monkeys news, commentary and analysis for “One Minute More”! This week we talk about emotions and decisions portrayed without a single moment of dialogue, the masterful weaving of flashback and current narrative, the heart-breaking sacrifices that both Hannah and Cassie must make, and the beautiful fireside moment that gives this episode its name. Read more…
TM56 – S4E8 – Demons http://traffic.libsyn.com/thefringepodcast/uncaged56.mp3 “Demons” has an epic feel that takes us as close to the beginning and end of things as we've ever been in 12 Monkeys! The medieval setting really gives the story the depth it needed to take the team up the stairs to ring the bell, but what could the loss of the weapon mean? And where would the makeshift splinter machine have taken Cole? Join us for 12 Monkeys news, commentary and analysis for “Demons”! This week we talk about Jennifer's important realizations, the Seers' cryptic statements, Andrus' amazing characterization, Olivia's grim determination, Cole's wonderful vest rescue, and – of course – Deacon's ultimate sacrifice.

It is the restaurant of choice for the rich and infamous – singer Beyoncé dined there last year, as do bikies – though the paradox is that the pricey cuisine is influenced by poor areas of central Italy where simple country cooking, like roast meals, dominate.
Wang has the opportunity to order a craft beer or fine Italian red on AFR Weekend's tab, but they opt for a glass of Coke.
"After one beer my face is all red, and I lose my tongue a bit," says Wang. "I tried to improve my alcohol tolerance. I tried for two years; it didn't work out."
Wang is 181 centimetres tall and their absent belly suggests they have no food or beverage vices, let alone a drinking problem. They reckon they lose up to three kilograms a week when they are in Canberra, because "who has time for lunch, anyway?"
PUP senator Dio Wang tells the AFR's Jonathan Barrett over lunch that without the Tiananmen crackdown - despite its casualties - "the country [China] would have descended into hell". Philip Gostelow
This sparks a conversation about politicians and their eating habits, and I start relaying the details of Education Minister Christopher Pyne's calorie-counting diet obsession I once read about.
"I think it was Christopher Pyne who was on same strange…" I begin.
"Drug," Wang says, on cue with a laugh.

Wang's Coke arrives. On the waiter's advice, I am drinking a glass of red from the Vietti vineyards, located in the north-west of Italy; an area encased on three sides by the alps.
The right way to create wealth
Zhenya "Dio" Wang was born in China's mountainous east, in Nanjing, where their parents worked in a forklift assembling factory.
They describe their childhood as "just below middle class", before the market principle reforms in China of the late 1970s and early 80s allowed their family to forge ahead. The period of economic reform has left Wang with an ideology that could be described as a mix of capitalism and socialism; both without the hard edges.
"You can't put everyone on the same wealth line; you need to let someone who is more entrepreneurial to grow their business and they will in turn provide jobs and drag people out of poverty," says Wang. "But if you allow capitalists to develop their way, eventually we will be looking at very low wages because all of their interest is in exploiting workers … to create wealth for themselves."
Wang emigrated to Australia in 2003, and in the ensuing 12 years they studied civil engineering, headed a resources company controlled by business person and politician Clive Palmer, and won a spot in the Senate.
Along the way, Wang adopted the nickname "Dio" to give Australians "a name they can pronounce".
(Zhenya is pronounced with the "j" sound associated with the name Gerald. Their surname is regularly mispronounced "Wang" when it sounds more like "Wong". Not that they mind either way: "I'm the last person in the whole world who is worried about my [name] pronunciation," they say.)
Advertisement
Now aged 34, married and father to a five-year-old daughter, Wang is often dismissed as a "puppet" for their larger-than-life party boss. But after spending almost two hours with the West Australian Senator, I wonder who is really pulling the strings.
"I had the benefit of working with [Palmer] for several years before joining the party so I know exactly how they operate," says Wang. "I know how to convince them and I know sometimes how to work around him."
After almost one year into their first term in the Senate, Wang is primarily known for not being well known.
It's not that they are necessarily shy.  They are known to try and order "off the menu" – when they last ate at Perugino, they unsuccessfully tried to order pizza as a main course; this time they choose the gnocchi in a duck ragù, which once again, doesn't usually come in a main course size – and they have unexpectedly, and somewhat boldly, brought their chief of staff along to eat on this newspaper's tab.
They disclose part-way through the lunch that they love spicy food, because chilli-filled Sichuan cuisine was all the rage during their taste-bud formative teens, but they politely turned down several offers to choose a restaurant that suited their tastes, and instead relied on my recommendation.
I chose Perugino for no other reason than it was the infamous "crime scene" of 2005 when the then Labor leader Kevin Rudd dined with disgraced former West Australian Premier Brian Burke, among others. Rudd survived the intense fallout even though association with Burke proved fatal to many other political careers.
While restaurant staff are sick of the Rudd-Burke story, it has enhanced its mystique, and perhaps allows it to get away with charging $6 for a coffee
Party process for one

Wang's rise in the political ranks didn't involve any clandestine lunches with powerbrokers. Despite having little political interest before the 2013 federal election, they expressed an interest to Palmer in running for PUP, and was subsequently placed at the top of the party's Senate candidate list.
Their role in Parliament was secured after a rerun of the Senate race in Western Australia was held in April 2014, made necessary after almost 1400 votes went missing in the original race.
The once influential PUP had a crucial voting bloc in the Senate before Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie, and then Queensland Senator Glenn Lazarus, sensationally quit. Wang says they initially tried to convince both senators to stay with the party; although in Lambie's case, personality and ideology clashes made the split inevitable.
"We knew they would leave the party at some stage. In the latter stages I didn't bother," Wang says.
It's hard to tell whether Wang is being tongue-in-cheek when they say that the party resignations aren't all bad. "The party room process is a lot easier now – it's just myself," they say.
No lunch date is complete with at least one awkward moment.
That occurs when I ask my lunchmate about the circumstances around Lazarus' party resignation, which occurred in March shortly after their wife, Tess Lazarus, was sacked by Palmer for "failing to comply" with the terms of their employment.
I ask what caused Lazarus to resign.

"The media has reported correctly," Wang responds.
"What does that mean?" I say.
Silence.
"Can I have a no comment on this one," they finally say.
Anti-politician
Wang hasn't had a drink, but their face does turn a light shade of rouge. It's as if it pains them not to speak openly about a subject. They don't like political games. They are, in many respects, the anti-politician.
 They are not ashamed to publicly wrestle with a difficult policy. While they mostly support the Coalition's asylum-seeker policies, they concede that stopping the boats and "saving lives at sea" might just mean a refugee dies somewhere else.
"They are just dying at different places by different means," they say. "I guess there's no shame in struggling with this one as the whole world is struggling with this."
Advertisement
Answering critics who say they went underground during the election, they say that just because they don't call press conferences, it doesn't mean they have nothing to say.
"When I have something to say I'll come out and say it," says Wang. "But when someone tries to push me into saying something…
"I believe the less you say the better it is in getting the real message out."
Besides, they say the media hasn't been interested in their views, while they "jump up and down" when Palmer says something.
So, Zhenya "Dio" Wang, what do you want to say?
In Wang's maiden Senate speech, they made an impassioned plea to remember Japan's "six week-long massacres, a six week-long nightmare" in their childhood home city of Nanjing.
"For China, it may be the longest six weeks in its entire history," Wang said in their speech, alleging, "But for the Imperial Japanese Army, it was never too short to torture, to rape, to murder 300,000 innocent men, women and children."
Wang says Parliament offered the perfect forum to raise war crimes they say that Japan has never properly apologised for.
Advertisement
"I think we need to be reminded of that," they say. "It had to be there [in the speech]."
Wang is eating chocolate hazelnut cake, while my policy of always ordering tiramisu at Italian restaurants has been put at risk by the waiter's recommendation to try the baked ricotta, which has been "made in Naples for I don't know how many hundreds of years".
(The waiter gives me a half slice of both.)
Defence of Tiananmen
I ask the Senator whether they considered critiquing China's actions in their speech, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre of June, 1989, when the military used live ammunition to clear a protest, resulting in several hundred casualties.
"Based on the information I have, I think the government did the right thing," Wang says. "Obviously when criminals and students get mixed up, you can't really identify each one of them. So when there was force to be deployed you may get innocent casualties."
"Sorry," I say. "Are you saying at Tiananmen Square, the government did the right thing?"
"I think they did the right thing," Wang says. "Otherwise the country would have descended into hell."

Wang does denounce China's bloody Cultural Revolution, but I get the impression through the lunch that they wish Australia was a little bit more like the Middle Kingdom.
"I am fairly supportive of China simply because, despite the critics, I think it's moving in the right direction," Wang says. "It's probably moving in the direction I was talking about – socialism and capitalism one day connecting."

LONDON (Reuters) - British farmers are holding back on big investments as they brace for the UK's exit from the European Union, their largest market and a vital source of subsidies.

Agriculture enjoyed a brief boost after Britain voted to leave the bloc last June, when a weaker pound lifted profits by about 12 percent and subsidy payments by roughly 15 percent, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) estimates.
UK food and drink exports rose nearly 10 percent to a record 20 billion pounds in 2016, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said on Tuesday.
While more cash on hand usually spurs investment, farmers have become cautious as the benefit of the weaker pound fades and lifts the price of imported inputs such as fertilisers.
“There's big uncertainty ahead,” said Stuart Roberts, a cereals and cattle farmer with 1,400 acres of land in Hertfordshire and Kent. “The benefits we were seeing - that was always going to be a short-term gain.”
“Certainly, at the moment, we are not looking to do any big investments in the pure farming stuff like machinery, land, new tenancies.”
An NFU survey late last year showed British farmers on the whole plan to reduce spending on machinery by 26 percent and land investment by 31 percent over the next three years.
Some 37 percent of English farmland marketed in 2016 attracted no offers by the end of the year, up from 13 percent in 2015, data from property group Strutt and Parker shows.
Farmland values fell 2.6 percent in the fourth-quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter, property consultant Knight Frank said.
“Medium-term confidence has been dented by increasing uncertainty about the EU and the higher cost base,” NFU economist Anand Dossa said. “People will put investment plans on back burners as a result of that uncertainty.”
Appetite for bank finance from the agriculture, hunting and forestry sectors is still growing at about 2 percent annually but has slipped from levels seen between 2012 and 2015, when demand rose by roughly 10 percent a year, Bank of England figures show.
The slowdown began before the June vote but has intensified in recent months and is expected to deepen in 2017, a spokesperson for the British Bankers' Association said.

‘TOUGHER TIMES'
British farmers received 2.8 billion pounds in support last year under the EU's Basic Payment Scheme. Farming and environment minister Andrea Leadsom said on Tuesday that for some UK farmers this payment accounted for 70 percent of their bottom line.
The government has promised that these payments will continue until 2020, but the future beyond then is unclear.
“There is no guarantee how much will be available after Brexit,” said Graham Redman, a research economist at the Andersons Centre, a farm and rural business consultancy.
“But everyone is assuming it will be less. And if it is, we might have some economically tougher times to get through.”
Leadsom said Britain was looking to build new partnerships and strike the best free trade deals for Britain while noting that 60 percent of exports go direct to the EU.
“The EU is our most important trading partner, a fact that won't change when we leave, and a relationship we are determined to uphold,” they said, adding Britain was seeking tariff-free trade with Europe.
Roberts is taking no chances. He's shifted their own focus to building closer relationships with consumers and moving down the supply chain.
“What we're trying to do is structure our business in a way that makes it at least as resilient as possible.”

Tuesday's election results offer further evidence that Texas mirrors America, with urban voters strongly favoring Democrats, while rural and many suburban voters favor Republicans.
Republican Donald Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in 227 of the state's 254 counties, racking up an advantage of 1,697,593 votes.
Their biggest vote yield came in Montgomery County, one of several suburban counties — like Collin, Denton and Parker — that turned in reliably high Republican votes. Tarrant was the most populous county in their column, turning in a pile of Republican votes in spite of Clinton's victory in Fort Worth, its biggest city.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Trump also won many of the state's mid-size cities and nearly all of its rural areas.
Clinton beat Trump in 27 counties by a total of 883,819 votes. That was enough to cut their overall margin in half, but not nearly enough to pull off a Texas upset.
Here's another thing spotted in a run through the election results: Straight-ticket voting doesn't always tell you how the political winds will blow.
Them wins came in some of the state's biggest counties — Harris, Dallas, Bexar, Travis, El Paso, Hidalgo and Fort Bend. They won the vast majority of rural Texas, but not everything: Clinton took a few relatively unpopulated counties like Kenedy and Culberson.
Trump's overall margin was smaller than Mitt Romney's 2012 win in Texas. In fact, the Republican at the top of this year's ticket got a smaller percentage of the overall vote in Texas than any of the eight Republicans running statewide here, a group that included candidates for the Railroad Commission and the state's two highest courts. Conversely, Clinton got a higher percentage of the vote than any of the Democrats running statewide.
A win is a win is a win, and this year belonged to the Republicans. Their streaks are intact: They've won the last 10 presidential elections in Texas and every statewide race in every election since 1994. But one takeaway from this year's contests is that Democrats reduced the normal Republican margins and their scattered blue spots on the Texas map — the state's biggest cities — turned in stronger Democratic performances than they have in the past.
Here's another thing spotted in a run through the election results: Straight-ticket voting doesn't always tell you how the political winds will blow.

State Rep. Bobby Guerra, D-Mission, won 56.8 percent of the vote even after being tied to an unpopular ballot measure that would have created a hospital district in Hidalgo County. Most voters — 71.8 percent — opposed that proposal even while re-electing its author. One clue to their survival was that 49.7 percent of the county's voters were straight-ticket Democrats, while only 16.3 percent voted straight-ticket Republican.
Straight-ticket voters in Harris County wiped out courthouse Republicans, including state district Judge Ryan Patrick, son of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. That house-cleaning — Democrats won every countywide seat in the state's biggest county — stirred some intra-party recriminations between supporters of county GOP Chairman Paul Simpson and those of their predecessor, Jared Woodfill. But consider this: 35 percent of the voters were straight-ticket Democrats, while Republicans lagged behind at 30 percent.
Judge Patrick took the loss in stride, but they admitted to at least one regret on Twitter: “You know what Im going to miss? Being able to swear in my dad when they win reelection in 2018. (totally selfish one there).”
The straight-ticket demon didn't get everybody. Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty — they of the most popular political ad in the country during this election cycle — won re-election despite a nine-point disadvantage in straight-ticket voting and Trump's 18-percentage point loss to Clinton in Daugherty's commissioner district.
Turnout was down and also up, depending on how you want to think about it. Unofficially, 8.9 million people voted this year, up from just under 8 million four years ago. That's 59.1 percent of the state's registered voters this time, 58.6 percent last time. As a percentage of the state's adults, turnout was 42.9 percent on Tuesday, down from 43.7 percent four years ago.

They might not have predicted this, but Republicans won full control of the federal government in Tuesday's elections. For Texas Republicans, that removes a major political foil.
We've reached the eve of the election, with many political fortune-tellers predicting big changes in Texas. Here's a way to measure it, if it happens.
Some elections are referendums on issues, public votes that give lawmakers a good idea of what voters want. This election isn't one of those.
At Mashaldanga, a Bangladeshi enclave in India, Friday. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)
Faced with an unusual choice, a couple in Bangladesh have decided to split after four years of marriage as the husband wants to move to India, while the wife wants to stay in Bangladesh.
Advertising
The couple, Sarwar Alam and Marina Begum, live in Dasiarchhara — one of the 51 Indian enclaves in Bangladesh — which will be part of Bangladesh on Friday midnight.
On August 1, the India-Bangladesh Land Boundary Agreement will come into force, and on this “appointed day”, 111 Bangladesh enclaves will be part of India. In all, an estimated 16,000 people will become Indians Saturday.
[related-post]
Sarwar and Marina, both in their 20s, were given a choice — offered to all enclave-dwellers — whether they want to stay at the Indian enclaves in Bangladesh and become Bangladeshi citizens, or move to India and get Indian citizenship. The choice had to be exercised between July 6 and 16.
While the couple agreed to move to India on July 9, the wife changed their mind and told officials they want to stay back. “The change of option was communicated to us before July 16. This is a valid personal choice, which has to be respected,” a South Block official said.
The couple have two sons, and the wife has decided they will stay with them in Bangladesh. The husband now has time till November 30 to move to India. South Block officials found this unique case while they were taking stock of the headcount of people who want to move or stay back.
Sources said a total of 979 people in 222 families from Indian enclaves in Bangladesh have decided to move to India and acquire Indian citizenship. Of the 222 families, 146 are Hindus and 76 are Muslims.
Not a single resident of the 111 Bangladeshi enclaves in India has opted to move to Bangladesh, officials said. With the stroke of the midnight on Friday, 15,134 residents of Bangladeshi enclaves, as well as 979 who have chosen to migrate, will be eligible for becoming Indian citizens. This will mean that 16,113 people will become Indian citizens on Saturday.
Their Aadhaar cards and ration cards will be processed in the next few months. Bangladesh will have 39,544 new citizens from the 51 Indian enclaves, officials said.

Sources said that the movement of people from Bangladesh to India will take place only after the monsoons, which usually last till September. “The local authorities have said that the best time will be after Durga Puja celebrations late October onwards,” an official said.
This article is about a shopping mall in Markham, Ontario. It is not to be confused with Pacific Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Coordinates:
Pacific Mall is an Asian shopping centre in Markham, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the northeast corner of Steeles Avenue and Kennedy Road, along the city limits with Toronto.
History [ edit ]
The mall is built on the site formerly occupied by Cullen Country Barns, a farm-themed complex housing shops, theatre, and restaurants. The complex was founded by Len Cullen, the founder of Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village in Whitby, Ontario, and consisted of two barn wings with gambrel roofs and a concrete silo. None were historic structures dating back to the time when the site was a working farm, but they were acquired by Cullen and moved from Pickering, Ontario to Markham in the 1970s.[1] A fire damaged part of the complex in 1988,[2] and it was demolished in 1994; some portions of the former Market Village mimic the Cullen complex.
Pacific Mall opened in 1997. Designed by Wallman Clewes Bergman Architects, their initial proposal was modified by the aesthetic expectations of Markham Town Council (since promoted to City Council in 2012). Its Cantonese name, "太古廣場" (Tai Gu Gwong Cheung), is derived from Pacific Place in Hong Kong.
Features [ edit ]
Heritage Town in the Pacific Mall.
Pacific Mall is surrounded by an existing shopping plaza, including the former Market Village. Collectively, the mall and its surrounding buildings encompass over 500 stores and 1,500 indoor and outdoor parking spaces.
The mall has two floors and a basement level that leads to an underground parking lot. The corridors of the main floor are named after streets in Hong Kong (such as various numbered streets ending in the digit 8, Hennessy Avenue, Hollywood Avenue, Pacific Avenue, Queen's Avenue, and Nathan Avenue, though Hennessy, Hollywood, Queen's, and Nathan are actually roads in Hong Kong, while Pacific Avenue is named after the asupervisorstioned Pacific Place); this is where the majority of shops are located, and where major events held at the mall take place. The second floor contains additional shops, a food court, and Heritage Town, a Pacific-style market that contains approximately 100 vendors.
As an official Canadian Tourist Attraction, the mall is exempt from the Retail Business Holiday Act and is open year-round, including statutory holidays.[3][4]
Future expansion [ edit ]
On June 15, 2005, Pacific Mall and Market Village announced a 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-metre) expansion that would add additional retail space, a luxury hotel, condominiums, and a multi-level parking structure. The expansion, which would link to the planned Remington Centre, would bring the combined size of the malls to one million square feet.[5] Initially slated to commence construction in 2009,[6] the project has faced numerous delays.[7] While the expansion plan was endorsed by Markham City Council in 2011, it requires additional approvals from the municipal government of Toronto, as well as consent from a majority of the ownership of the Pacific Mall, 40 percent of which is composed of individual retailers.[8]
Controversies [ edit ]

Counterfeit merchandise [ edit ]
The Pacific Mall is noted for its sale of counterfeit and pirated goods, including video games, movies, music, electronic devices, cosmetics, apparel, and fragrances. In January 2018, the mall was listed as a notorious market by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), which noted that vendors in the Pacific Mall “operate largely with impunity” despite requests for assistance from law enforcement.[9][10] Pacific Mall management responded that they were "deeply disturbed" by the designation, stated that they would give warnings to vendors who sold illicit goods, and launched a website for the public to report counterfeit items.[11]
The mall has been raided multiple times by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP):
In May 2005, over $800,000 worth of unlicensed CDs and DVDs were seized.[12][13]
On July 13, 2006, over one thousand copies of pirated video game software were seized.[14]
On February 6–7, 2009, over 49,000 DVDs, 217 DVD burners, and over 100,000 blank DVDs were seized. Four individuals were charged with multiple counts under the Copyright Act.[15]
On December 3, 2012, over $3 million worth of counterfeit goods were seized from the Pacific Mall as a part of "Project Consumer Safety."[16][17]
On June 27, 2018, seven search warrants were executed for stores in the Pacific Mall, resulting in the seizure of clothing, handbags, and cell phone accessories.[18]
In March 2009, the RCMP teamed with the York Regional Police and commenced uniformed foot patrols in shopping malls located in south Markham, including the Pacific Mall, in an effort to curb the sale of counterfeit items.[19][20]
Traffic congestion [ edit ]
Pacific Mall is a major contributor to traffic congestion in southern Markham. The surrounding road infrastructure, which was built only to accommodate Market Village, is insufficient in accommodating the large volume of vehicle traffic that the mall receives. Pacific Mall also suffers from a parking shortage; though the mall contains an underground garage facility, no additional parking has been added since the mall's opening in 1997.[21][22][23]
February 2009 shooting [ edit ]
On February 20, 2009, Kit Chen 'Daniel' Cheong, 26, was shot in the head at the XSITE Cell Phones store in the Pacific Mall. They were rushed to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, but was pronounced dead on February 21, 2009. The primary suspect in the case, Bryan Valentine Gardner, was seen on security cameras installed in Pacific Mall. They were eventually arrested in London, Ontario on September 2, 2010, 18 months after the incident.[24] In 2013, Gardner was sentenced to life in prison, with no chance of parole until 2026.[25]
Transportation access [ edit ]
Pacific Mall is located at the major intersection of Steeles Avenue and Kennedy Road. It is served by both the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC routes 43 Kennedy and 53 Steeles East) and York Region Transit (YRT Route 8 Kennedy) buses, and is located within walking distance from Milliken GO Station, which connects to the Stouffville line. The two entrance roads of the mall are Redlea Avenue and Clayton Drive.

After a day off recovering from jet lag, which I somehow end up spending whizzing up and down the hills of San Francisco on a Segway, I head off down Highway 101 to Mountain View to record the first interview in my Little Atoms road trip. I'm meeting Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the Seti Institute and presenter of their excellent Big Picture Science radio show and podcast.
Seth is the public face of Seti, he's the SETI GUY. At least that's what it says on their car registration plate. Seti is an abbreviation of Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence, and that's what Seth does. He's a full-time alien hunter.
Founded in 1984, for 10 years the Seti Institute was initially part of a wider Nasa-funded search for alien intelligence, until the space agency's project fell victim to budget cuts. Since then the institute has relied on private donations and endowments to keep it going, and judging by its headquarters, they are doing ok for funding. The institute is in the middle of a huge industrial estate, albeit the richest, most innovative and manicured industrial estate in the world, otherwise known as Silicon Valley.
The search for alien radio signals is only a tiny part of the work done by the Seti Institute – most of its scientists are astrobiologists who are looking for life of a less intelligent, more microbial kind elsewhere in the solar system, mainly on the moons of the outer planets.
However, it's the image of a scientist listening out for a message from the cosmos, perhaps one who looks a bit like Jodie Foster, which tends to catch the public's imagination.
I meet up with Seth in their office (he doesn't look like Jodie Foster). They ask if I'd like to record the interview in the institute's own recording studio. This is where Seth, Molly Bentley and the team record Big Picture Science, of which I'm a huge fan, so I'm delighted to take them up on the offer. It later transpires that Seth is something of an audiophile and has built this studio himself, so don't expect the rest of the recordings on this trip to match this one in sound quality!
"The modern idea of using antennas to eavesdrop on ET goes back to Frank Drake's original 1960 experiment called Project Ozma," Seth tells me. That's Frank Drake of the eponymous Drake Equation. He's still a part of the institute, and although he's not in on the day of my visit, I later get a glimpse of their office.
Drake's Project Ozma focused on just two nearby stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. Nowadays, SETI uses the Allen Telescope Array, funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, to monitor thousands of stars. However, even before Project Ozma, Seth reminds me, Edison, Tesla and Marconi had all considered the possibility that radio waves might be receivable from Mars or elsewhere.
I'm interested to know how the news of alien life – be it of vast intellect (hopefully not "intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic") or simply microbial – would be greeted on Earth, and whether this would provoke some great existential change. Seth thinks that unlikely.
"In a sense we've run that experiment. In 1996 there was an announcement by Nasa that they had found dead microbes in a meteorite that had come from Mars. No doubt it had come from Mars; the doubt was whether these were really microbes of course but, at least for the couple of days of that story, the assumption was: Nasa is announcing this, these are reputable scientists."
Of course we know how that turned out, but as Seth points out: "It was the biggest science story of the year – people didn't riot in the streets. Nor did peace and brotherhood break out."
But this very issue remains one of the main concerns of the conspiracy theorists, who believe that the US government wouldn't trust the public with such knowledge. According to Seth: "There are a lot of people who think that finding life would be enormously disruptive. In this country people say, well if you guys find a signal, the government would shut it down, you'd keep it quiet, and the reason given for that is that it would disrupt society. Well there's no evidence for that at all."
While it's easy to picture scientists sitting around waiting to be surprised by an incoming signal, the reality is that the Allen Telescope Array is constantly bombarded by radio waves. The trick is to filter out the wheat from the chaff, most of which is as Seth describes, "all from an intelligent society, namely ours".
And of course we haven't identified a signal from an intelligent alien species yet. We'd definitely know about it if we had, despite the doubts of the conspiratorially minded.
Of all of the many false alarms, I ask Seth, which one was the most interesting? They tell me that "there was one that we got in the summer of 1997 … It had us fooled for most of a day." It turned out to be an equipment failure, the signal coming from a European satellite.
As I say, the vast majority of science regarding the possibility of alien life is being done by astrobiologists, and a few days later I was afforded a glimpse at the heart of a mission to look for signs of life on another planet in our solar system. But that's a story for the next column.

What would you do if you walked into a downtown McDonald's and were confronted with a group of men carrying guns? If you are like most of us, you would probably flee for your life and then immediately call the cops. However, in California and many other states, there is not much the police could do except keep a close eye on the armed men.
While some states ban the practice of "open carry" of weapons, most states permit the open carrying of firearms, often with few or no restrictions. Ironically, some of the Southern states like Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and South Carolina ban open carrying of weapons - a vestige of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. However, in the wake of the Tucson shootings, efforts have begun to repeal "open carry" laws that have been exploited for political purposes by the more extreme elements of the gun rights community.
In California, Assemblyman Anthony Portantino has introduced a bill that would repeal the "open carry" loophole in state law. The bill, which is supported by police organizations, has also been introduced in similar form in the Los Angeles City Council. Although a repeal bill was introduced in the California Assembly in 2010, it died because of opposition from gun rights activists. However, Portantino and other supporters hope that recent events, including several shootings at Los Angeles schools, will tip the balance toward repeal.
It is worth noting that the "open carry" movement, which featured visits by gun-toting men to Starbucks, is controversial even within the gun rights movement. Charles Cotton, a prominent gun rights activist and NRA Board Member, wrote on their blog, "The open-carry issue has pitted gun owners against one another like no other issue. Even the so-called 'assault weapons' ban didn't generate so much hostility between friends." Cotton, who believes that the open-carry movement will "damage our ability to promote the interest of gun owners in the future," points out that the NRA has not taken a position on open-carry legislation in Texas, which would lift the ban on carrying weapons openly in public.
Ironically, the first legislation in California to restrict public carrying of firearms came in 1967 in response to members of the Black Panther party openly carrying guns, notably in front of the State Capitol. This prompted the passage of the Mulford Act, which prohibited the public carrying of loaded firearms. The bill was signed into law by none other than Governor Ronald Reagan. In that case - as in the case of the "open carry" movement in the Starbucks stores - the legislation was prompted by provocative displays of firearms aimed at making a political point.
There is simply no rationale for the open carrying of weapons, an act which itself can be viewed as a provocation. Even arch-conservative Supreme Court Justice Scalia has written that "Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."
Some gun rights advocates have argued that the Tucson shooter might have been stopped if one of the bystanders were carrying a gun. In fact, it was reported that there was an onlooker who had a licensed gun. Interviewed after the shootings, the onlooker admitted that, in the confusion of the moment, they had very nearly shot the wrong man - one of the heroes who had wrestled the shooter to the ground. So much for the wisdom of more guns on the scene.
Marketing is in full-force here at Reactuate Games. With a little over a month until Kickstarter, the team has had idea-fever (it's a thing), and our marketing to-do list is growing.
One idea that we're extremely excited about is our new podcast series. Since our first weeks at RG, we've aspired to produce a gaming podcast, but we felt too much time would be taken away from other, more important projects. At this stage in our journey, however, it's vital to collaborate with other gaming-industry influencers, build our community of supporters, and spread the word about our game.
With the movie Pixels coming out this Friday, I saw the debut as an opportunity to introduce our company to those who enjoy or enjoyed gaming in Abilene. This Adam Sandler film is about aliens misconstruing feeds of classic video games as threatening, so the extraterrestrials send arcade-faves, like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, to destroy earth.
Epic. Just epic.
I'm planning to see the movie this weekend, so while I'm out I'll pass out flyers about our game, hopefully letting a few interested strangers know that a video game company exists right here in town. Fingers are crossed on this one!
Another project we're working on is an incentivized survey for our email subscribers. Sharing by word of mouth is still a crucial part of marketing, so we're offering subscribers to choose what we do next here at RG, and we'll do it … once we get a certain number of subscribers. This will encourage others to share the website and our work. Some of the choices include me writing a flash fiction piece involving the colonists and streaming a special Youtube video for the subscribers.
I'm always trying to learn more about my job. Therefore, I've been going through YouTube Creator Academy, a helpful video series that teaches the fundamentals of sustaining and popularizing a YouTube channel. Tips on titles, thumbnails, and talking to your audience are all included. For those wanting to grow an audience on this site should look over these short clips and take notes.
I'm also reading Made to Stick, a marketing book that specializes in getting people's core ideas to stick with the public. Using the acronym SUCCESs, the authors breakdown the techniques to having good concepts being remembered. Simplicity, Unexpectedness, and Concreteness are just a few of the strategies to consider. This book can actually work for many professions and not simply marketing (teachers, I'm looking at you).
Finally, Ron and I spent a little time (like two hours) writing up our target audience avatar, Caleb. This imaginary man is a representative of the people we believe will buy and enjoy our game. It's crucial to understand Caleb as we market our game and company. We'll share an in-depth post on Caleb later.
Are you marketing a game now? What ideas have seemed to help? Let us know in the comments below!
Time magazine taps Donald Trump as “Person of the Year,” and is announcing the news on the Today show.
Trump has had a rocky relationship with the magazine. Despite a cover story featuring photos of the president-elect with a bald eagle, other Time covers declared their campaign a “meltdown” as they struggled in the general election.
Time Magazine's Nancy Gibbs said on the Today show that it wasn't a hard choice to choose Trump.
“When have we ever seen a single individual who has so defied exceptions, broken the rules, violated norms, beaten not one but two political parties on the way to winning an election they entered with 100-1 odds against him?” they asked.
Trump called into the Today show to discuss the decision, calling it a “great honor,” noting that they grew up reading the magazine.
Hillary Clinton was selected as the number two person of the year.
Furious Jean-Claude Juncker last night lashed out at Donald Trump's attempts to sideline the EU and vowed Brussels would move to block any attempted trade deals between the US and member states.
In a rancorous speech the EU Commission chief accused the eurosceptic President of giving them the “cold shoulder” and ignoring the role of eurocrats in running European trade negotiations.
Mr Trump has openly stated previously that they prefer dealing bilaterally with countries on a one to one basis and is not a fan of overbearing supranational structures like the EU.
The billionaire tycoon has also been publicly keen on striking an economic pact with Britain, which will be able to forge its own trade policy for the first time in 45 years once it has left the EU.

HONG KONG — Four farmers in southwest China were killed Friday when one or more bombs released from a warplane from Myanmar struck a sugar cane field, as fighting between Myanmar's government forces and an ethnic group pressed against the frontier with China.
The deaths, reported by Chinese state-run television, appeared to be the worst instance so far of the recently renewed conflict between Myanmar's army and armed supporters of the Kokang people, an ethnic Chinese minority, rippling into neighboring Yunnan Province in China. Another nine people were wounded by the bombing, said Xinhua, the main Chinese state news agency.
Late on Friday, a Chinese vice minister for foreign affairs, Liu Zhenmin, summoned Myanmar's ambassador in Beijing, U Thit Linn Ohn, to denounce the deaths and the intrusion into Chinese territory, Xinhua reported. The reports did not say whether the Chinese government thought the intrusion was deliberate or accidental.
“We urge the Myanmar side to thoroughly investigate this incident and report the findings to the Chinese side, and to sternly punish the perpetrator,” Mr. Liu told the ambassador, according to Xinhua.
Having got white washed in ODI and T20 series and unfortunately losing the first test drifting from a comfortable position Bangladesh is on the edge of getting comprehensively white washed in all formats in New Zealand tour.
The whitewash in ODI series is going to cost Bangladesh dropping down to 8th position in ICC ODI ranking. With Captain Mushfique and opening batsman Kayes unfit for the final test match starting tomorrow at Hagley Oval Christchurch the task is well cut out for Bangladesh. Bangladesh must play for pride. True absence of two key players, accomplished batsmen would hurt yet the confidence from batting superbly in the first innings of Wellington test must work well on the psyche of Bangladesh batsmen in Christchurch.
Soumya due to open innings withstand in skipper Tamim can make a useful contribution with bat and ball if they can carry their form of last two T20 into the test match. They need to make a judicious choice of their strokes. If they take rediscover their fluent form Bangladesh can wrest initiative early on as their senior partner already showed the way how to counter attack Kiwi quicks early on to unsettle them. Soumya will add pace bowling option affording an opportunity for inclusion of Taijul Islam as the third spinner beside Shakib and Miraj.  They are a better batsman than the other tailenders. Bangladesh can hurt Kiwi batting more with spin than by pace of inexperienced bowlers. I would suggest playing Rubel and Rabbi for the test. It is not that Subhashish and Taskin did not bowl well. But Bangladesh can make inroads into Kiwi batting by spin. Taijul is a good bowler and can bowl longer spells. Hagley Park wicket having bounce will suit their type of bowling. Bangladeshi bowled well in some spells but could not do that consistently. At times the bowling was too short to cause discomfort for Kiwi batsmen. They could not bowl in pairs. Perhaps nerves of inexperienced bowlers led them doing that. The addition of Rubel and Taijul may work better.
More than bowling Bangladesh must get out of batting trauma of the second innings. Mushfique showed the technique of playing and leaving short deliveries. Tamim should take a different approach to the test as they will not be having two seasoned batsmen in the test. They must guide their flamboyant partner Soumya in settling down before getting aggressive. Mominul is expected to play their role. Mahmudullah is due for long innings. Early order batsmen must set a platform for stroke makers Shakib and Shabbir consolidating the advantage. Nurul Hasan is as good a wicketkeeper as Mushfique. But at this moment Mushfique is perhaps the nucleus of Bangladesh batting. Hasan can also bat and bat well. Cannot make out what has happened to the batting of Miraj.  They are a much better batsman than what they are performing in national color. In the first test, last four batsmen contributed nothing. Taijul and Rubel if played may contribute better with the bat.
Bangladesh fielded poorly, dropped few vital catches at the crucial stage, ground fielding was also not good. Bangladeshi bowlers create few opportunities and those need to be accepted. Hope Tamim will improve their field setting.
We still feel even depleted Bangladesh team has the capability for proving competitive. Drawing the test and stretching Kiwis to their limit is still possible.
My team for Christchurch test would be
Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah Riad, Shakib Al Hasan, Shabbir Rahman, Nurul Hasan, Taijul Islam, Mehedi Miraj, Rubel Hossain and Kamrul Rabbi
With series on the border and comprehensive whitewash looming Bangladesh has little more to lose. In a cricket talk show, I saw Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhter highly appreciating Bangladesh performance in Basin Reserve. A good steady performance at Christchurch would salvage pride. Bangladesh needs that before the lone test against India in India.

Parks & Recreation star says Murdoch contributes to an ‘insane amount of evil'
Aziz Ansari, the US standup comedian and one of the stars of the sitcom Parks & Recreation, has launched a withering attack on Rupert Murdoch after the mogul's comments about the Charlie Hebdo killings in Paris.
Murdoch wrote in a tweet: “Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.” Ansari sarcastically replied: “Rups can we get a step-by-step guide? How can my 60 year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups? Plz advise.” They followed up by tweeting: “Are you responsible for the evil shit all Christians do or just the insane amount of evil you yourself contribute to?” Other tweets included:
Aziz Ansari (@azizansari) .@rupertmurdoch, you're already a vaguely evil media conglomerate guy and THEN you're ALSO racist? FOR REAL?! You're an evil overachiever!
Taking Murdoch's logic to a knowingly absurd conclusion, they also wrote: “.@rupertmurdoch is Christian just like Mark David Chapman who shot John Lennon. Why didn't Rupert stop it? #RupertsFault”, and “.@rupertmurdoch is responsible for all pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic. @rupertmurdoch why are you pro-pedophile :(”.
Replying to a tweet in which Murdoch heralded the “heroic sacrifice” of Muslim police officer Ahmed Merabet, Ansari wrote: “Quit back peddling you racist piece of shit.”
The comedian joins JK Rowling in condemning Murdoch. The Harry Potter author tweeted:
J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate. http://t.co/Atw1wNk8UX
Like Ansari, they also ridiculed Murdoch's argument, writing: “The Spanish Inquisition was my fault, as is all Christian fundamentalist violence.” They also paid tribute to Lassana Bathily, the Muslim shop-worker who hid Jewish shoppers from the hostage situation in a Parisian grocery store.
× Expand Jonathan Goldsbie Tom Beyer, playing keyboards for the Clamshell Quintet at Newzapalooza on Nov. 1, 2013.
Mayor Rob Ford has lost the last member of their original team at City Hall.
Tom Beyer, the mayor's longtime receptionist and social media manager, voluntarily concluded their employment Friday, deciding that it was time to move on.
None of the remaining staff in the Mayor's Office have been there longer than a year, and only one was hired prior to the first reports of a video of Ford smoking what appeared to be crack cocaine. (Xhejsi "J.C." Hasko, according to the Star, began their employment on Monday, May 13, 2013; Gawker and the Star both broke news of the video on the Thursday evening of that week.)
Beyer, widely regarded as the most affable person in the Office of the Mayor, held the title of special assisant, other than a brief period in mid-2013 when they served as executive assistant to the mayor, following the abrupt departure of the job's previous holder. Beyer frequently staffed the front desk in the reception area, greeting visitors and answering phones, and was also the primary manager of the @TOMayorFord Twitter account and Facebook page.
"I was the very first guy hired on the campaign, and I'm the very last guy who's shuttin' the door," they say in an interview. Beyer, who says they first met Ford through friends in 2003, handled social media for Ford's 2010 run for mayor. (In the Information to Obtain a warrant for Sandro Lisi, former Ford staffer and longtime family friend David Price told police they were the one who first introduced Ford and Beyer.)
Beyer says they were listening to the CBC in January 2010 when they heard that John Tory would not be running for mayor that year; they called Ford that afternoon.
"I said, 'Rob, you gotta run. Now's your time,' [that] kind of thing," Beyer says. "And they called me back, and they said, 'Jeez, it sounds like a pretty good idea.'"
Beyer says that although Ford had raised the idea of running for mayor a number of times over the years (and their family had apparently considered it), Ford "hemmed and hawed" in early 2010.
"Honestly, I don't think it struck him, they just assumed Tory was gonna run. They were gonna back Tory back then, and then so with Tory jumping out, it was a perfect opportunity for Rob to jump in. 'Now's your chance, buddy.'"
Beyer says the mayor often tells him, "Tom, you got me into this!"
Now, four years later, the high-stress job has taken its toll. "It's a personal matter more than anything else - doctor's orders, really," Beyer says. "I'm leaving on good terms and everything, but I'm just gonna pursue new opportunities."
"I need a new gig," they say.
Police documented many interactions between Beyer and former Ford driver Sandro Lisi, including "approximately 36 points of telephone contact" from August 7 through September 19 of last year. On Friday, they obtained another warrant as part of their investigation into the mayor and their associates, which is now being overseen by the OPP. The Star reports that it may allow police to access secret recordings of the mayor taken by Lisi.
Beyer will continue to play keyboards for the Clamshell Quintet, the City Hall band consisting of several councillors, staff, and democratic-reform activist David Meslin. Currently, however, they are on hiatus until after the election.
Just 85 percent of the self-identified Democrats said they would “certainly” or “probably” vote. Ninety-five percent of Republicans said they would “certainly” or “probably” vote. Fifteen percent of Democrats said they were 50-50 — four times as many as Republicans. And you can see how that moves the numbers: The registered voters who participated in 2010 or 2012 — or were newly registered since 2012 — identified as Democrats by a 35 to 33 margin. Among the likely voters, it's Republicans by 34 to 32.
Q: I noticed that the polls, particularly the R.D.D. poll, offered some pretty bleak figures for the Democrats among Hispanic voters. As you know, there's a long discussion about whether polls are doing a good job of sampling Hispanic voters, or at least the most Democratic-leaning Hispanic voters. There's also a theory that Democrats have tended to outperform the pre-election polls in states like Colorado for this reason. Is there anything you're looking at that gives you confidence in your sample of Hispanic voters?
A: I don't know that I've ever seen a good sample of Hispanics. It's a real challenge. It's a tough population to poll.
There's a decision at the outset: Are you in a position to offer your clients bilingual interviews, and are they able to pay for polling both in Spanish and in English? When we give our clients the bilingual option, many decline for cost reasons. When they accept it, like Nevada in 2012, where all of our polling was bilingual, I don't know that we got one micron closer to the Latino population than had we polled in English only. Our data was criticized at the time for being too Republican, for being at odds with common sense. I get that criticism; I understand it. And the Hispanic data that you're looking at in Colorado, that shows a Republican ahead among Hispanics, is also at odds with common sense. So I can't defend it except that we give people the opportunity to self-identify as Hispanic, and we record it.
We have been accused in the past as having blacks who are not “black enough.” I get that criticism. Our black respondents, instead of being 90-10 Democratic, are sometimes 67-33. Do I think it turns out that way on Election Day? No, I think we're too Republican on black voters, just as we are sometimes too Republican on Hispanic voters. This is not unique to SurveyUSA.
Are there people who specialize in Latino polling who conduct elaborate studies and then in turn prove, to their satisfaction and probably mine, that the Latino population is overwhelmingly Democratic? Yes. Is there something that we can do better? I'm sure that there is. At the moment, though, it is what it is. It's what the respondents tell us when we give them a chance to identify as Hispanic and we ask them for whom they'll vote.
Q: If you think that your surveys systematically understate Democratic margins among nonwhite voters, how should poll consumers think about your results? Do you expect that your polls tend to understate Democrats, as many polls have in recent cycles? Or do you think that there's some countervailing, pro-Democratic bias among white voters that happens to cancel it out?
JL: Poll consumers should look at SurveyUSA's entire body of work — which goes back 20 years and is the largest of any state-level pollster. Seven-hundred-and-twenty-two of our recent statewide election polls were analyzed by FiveThirtyEight. They found across our entire body of work a Republican bias of 0.2 percentage points. That means our polls would have been more accurate, on average, had you taken away a tenth of one percentage point from the Republican candidate and given that tenth of one percentage point to the Democrat. I don't think the polls we publish need to be unskewed any more than that.
A recent announcement of the Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency (ISI) stated that the Taliban are taking shelter in the Gilgit and Baltistan areas. They are a disputed part of Jammu & Kashmir, according to the United Nation Commission on India and Pakistan (UNCIP) resolutions of 13th August, 1948, and of 5th January 1949. The announcement has created insecurity among two million people who are already denied development for 62 years since the creation of Pakistan.
The purpose of using the pretext of the presence of the Taliban in the area is to mislead USA and NATO forces who are involved in war on terror. They want to posit that the Taliban is a menace in the construction of the big dams and wish to occupy Gilgit and Baltistan themselves.
The Bhasha Diamar Mega Dams reservoir, located in Diamer, would submerge 110 kilometres of the Karakoram Highway and around 80,000 people would be displaced initially. After the extension of the Bhasha dam about 300,000 local indigenous people will be displaced and about a 200 kilometer area up to a Gilgit town will be submerged. This will destroy not only the oldest Buddhist civilization but other ancient civilizations as well.
Pakistan also has a plan to build a Mega dam in Skardu, Gigit district, which will lead to displacement of 200,000 aborigines. In height 650 feet, the Skardu Dam will submerge Skardu city along with its historical and sacred religious places and forts. It will also destroy large deposits of minerals together with ancient structures of all of Baltistan including, Kharmang, Shigar, Khapolu. Historical parts of Rundo will vanish from our earth forever.
Furthermore, the government of Pakistan also intends to build a third Dam in Bonji (disputed Territory), on the river Indus. No consultation with the people of the area or stakeholders has been forthcoming. This project will result in great losses affecting the environment, wild life, minerals including precious stonesestimated to be worth billions of dollars. Summarizing the displacement of various populations, it is estimated that 80,000 will be displaced by the Diamar Bhasha Dam, 300,000 from the Skardu dam and about 30,000 through the construction of the Bunji dam. These are all indigenous people of this land who will be displaced.
The population of Gilgit and Baltistan has never been assured that they will get royalties from the construction of the Bhasha-Diamer dam. It is expected that the reservoir will spread over an area of 7.3 million acres in Diamer, Northern areas of Jammu & Kashmir State would suffer inundation of about 32 villages. Another area of concern is a power house situated some kilometers away in North west frontier province (NWFP). It is supposed to generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity. Given Pakistans step-motherly treatment towards the people of this disputed territory, the royalties from the dam would accrue to the NWFP province and not to the Gilgit Baltistan areas. The power generating unit will be built in Bhasha in NWFP with the intention and the result of depriving the people of this disputed land of their rights.
Balawaristan National Front (BNF) appealed, on behalf of the 2 million people of Balawaristan (Pakistan Occupied Gilgit Baltistan) to the World Bank, IMF, Asian Development Bank and all the financial and donor agencies and countries including China. BNF requests them not to provide funds, loans, aid, or technical assistance. And most importantly, that technology not is provided to Pakistan for the construction of Mega dams like Bhasha Diamar Dam, Bonji Dam, Hanzel Dam, Skardu Dam and Khapolu Baltistan dam all of which are on disputed lands. The BNF claims that occupying forces of Pakistan are trying to attack the area of Diamar surrounding the Bhasha Dam. They are doing this under the pretext of eliminating the presence of the Taliban. The real purpose is to crush the struggle for freedom and the anti-Dam movement of the people of Diamar and Gilgit Baltistan.
The Asian Human Rights Commission urges government of Pakistan to desist from using the force under the pretext of Taliban and making mega dams to deprive the indigenous people who are the inhabitants since thousands years. The government should also consult the people and stakeholders on mega projects and must follow the resolutions of UNCIP. The governments unilateral decision to make mega dams will be disastrous for the local people as several hundred thousand people will be rendered home less.
James Mattis is quickly becoming one of the most powerful Defense secretaries in recent memory, with access to President Trump that few can match.
Trump last week gave the former Marine Corps general full authority to decide the number of additional U.S. troops sent to Afghanistan, a move that comes even before a war strategy has been set. The president has given Mattis similar authority in Iraq and Syria.

And while former President Obama talked frequently to their top commanders overseeing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, Trump has instead chosen to speak only to Mattis and a handful of other Cabinet secretaries, according to a White House spokesperson.
There is a “very, very close and good relationship” between Trump and Mattis, the spokesperson said, describing frequent working dinners “almost on a weekly basis, sometimes more than once a week.”
The two are sometimes joined at the dinners by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, another former Marine Corps general.
But Mattis above all seems to command the most time with Trump.
“They talk very, very regularly, Mattis probably more than any Cabinet secretary,” the spokesperson said.
Mattis enjoys strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. They were confirmed by the Senate in a 98-1 vote, with only Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten Elizabeth GillibrandWarren Buffett: I would support Bloomberg if they ran for president Warren vows to forgo 'fancy receptions or big money fundraisers' Dem Party chief defends initial response to Smollett incident: 'We acted on the facts as we knew at the time' MORE (D-N.Y.) voting against him.
One sign of Mattis's clout came last week during Trump's first Cabinet meeting at the White House.
While the other Cabinet members began the meeting by praising Trump and thanking them for the opportunity to serve, Mattis took a different tack.
“It's an honor to represent the great men and women of the Department of Defense. We are grateful for the sacrifices our people are making in order to strengthen our militaries so our diplomats always negotiate from a position of strength,” Mattis said.
While Mattis clearly has a seat at the table, some worry Trump's reliance on them and a handful of other Cabinet members is limiting the number of voices able to weigh in on critical national security matters.
“I think it makes the Pentagon bureaucracy nervous that the president will go directly to a very few people for their best military advice,” said one source familiar with the situation.
In testimony on Wednesday before a Senate panel, Mattis described Trump listening with rapt attention during briefings on the Middle East military strategy but added that the president tends not to drill down on details.
“There are frequent meetings, we go into a great deal of detail, and the president is keenly interested — not in all the tactical details — but getting the strategy right and knowing enough of the tactical detail that he's informed,” Mattis said.
Anthony Cordesman, a military strategy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said while Trump makes very clear their decisions on the likes of immigration laws and travel bans, “he certainly doesn't manage on the same level of detail as the average president” when it comes to the military.
“The review process through the [National Security Council] certainly still exists. He's not giving up presidential authority, but I think there's a tendency to delegate broadly in a lot of areas and then micromanage in areas that to some extent they campaigned on,” they said.
James Carafano, a defense policy expert at the Heritage Foundation and member of the Trump transition team, argued that Trump's hands-off approach is a “return to normal” compared to the painstaking detail the Obama administration took in authorizing military movements.
“Adjusting the troop levels for an advise-and-assist mission, an ongoing operation, is not a strategic presidential task,” Carafano told The Hill.
Trump has made no secret of their desire to take the reins off the military. During an April 13 speech following the use of the Pentagon's largest non-nuclear bomb — nicknamed the “mother of all bombs” — on a militant compound in Afghanistan, they boasted of the Pentagon's ability to execute quickly under their leadership.
“What I do is I authorize my military,” Trump said. “We have the greatest military in the world, and they've done the job as usual, so we have given them total authorization. And that's what they're doing. And frankly, that's why they've been so successful lately.”
The White House has frequently defended the Pentagon's authorization power, arguing the process allows commanders to respond to threats more rapidly.
“The president has always said, going back to the campaign trail, that the warfighters were very much hamstringed from doing the things they need to do to win. They were micromanaged under the Obama administration; to a degree they were micromanaged under the Bush administration,” the White House spokesperson said.
“It's not to say they have a hands-off approach — they have a very hands-on approach, but they work within the chain of command and they are allowing their secretary of Defense, who is the No. 2 in the chain of command, to go out there and execute.”
The downside to Mattis's power and influence is that they may shoulder more of the blame when things go wrong.
That's what happened after the Jan. 29 Yemen raid that resulted in the death of Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens.
Trump signed off on the plan on the advice of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Mattis and Dunford, but it was Gen. Joseph Votel — the commander of U.S. Central Command (Centcom) — who took responsibility.
“I am the Centcom commander, and I am responsible for what's done in my region and what's not done in my region. So I accept responsibility for this,” Votel said in March.
While Trump has developed a strong working relationship with Mattis, the Defense Department and White House have clashed over open positions at the Pentagon.
The White House has outright rejected potential nominees for being Democrats or for criticizing Trump during the presidential race. Mattis, meanwhile, has rejected some of the White House's suggested nominees as either unqualified or lacking defense policy knowledge.
The White House spokesperson would only say that staff has been supportive of Pentagon picks and are “working very closely with them to fill to spots.”
“It's a long process because of the nature of the positions. I think some people may interpret a backlog as something more than it is. These positions take a serious amount of vetting, a serious amount of paperwork.”

"We are right behind the Government on this one," a bubbly, 37-year-old spokestypewoman for Tesco—Britain's leading supermarket chain—told breathlessly. "Our stores are no longer prepared to turn a blind eye to the shocking abuse of vegetables by a sick minority of ." Among the list of unsavoury produce on the Government's hit list are courgettes, cucumbers, bananas, carrots and squashes, which will have to carry a Goverment Health warning that: 'improper use is liable to corrupt and deprave, and may lead to surgical intervention'. But that is just the thin edge of an extremely wide veg—or, wedge, as UK Minister for Sexual Health, Dr Frank Carrott, was at pains to point out to our researcher. "Only last week," the bespectacled women's health campaigner told us, "I saw a woman in my local Waitrose casually put a phallic-shaped butternut squash, a tub of marge and a packet of King Size condoms on the conveyor. Now what sort of example does that set to my two teenage daughters?" "Well, at least she's practising safe sex," we commented.
"That's as maybe," snorted Dr Carrott. "My proposed new Vegetable Abuse Bill will soon wipe the grin off the
"Bill?"
"Yes, If my legislation is passed the sale of these and other disgusting vegetable 'sex toys' will be restricted to married women over 65."
"Won't that rather undermine the Government's initiative to get the public eating more healthily?"
"We're not completely naïve, you know," bristled the Minister. "Pre-packaged, fresh, diced vegetables will be unaffected by the ban. As will tin carrots and pickled cucumbers. Let's see the filthy sluts try to with those!" Consumer watchdog, WhatVeg? were quick to pounce on the new health warnings, claiming that "this is a cynical move to drive up the price of fruit and veg ahead of the Minister's proposed new legislation."
A short, fat bloke carrying a sack of spuds in Covent Garden was bitter about the ban: "Supermarkets have gone bananas. This will only drive these desperate women onto the Black Market. In some parts of London butternut squashes are already changing hands at up to twenty quid each and you can't get your hands on a courgette for love nor money." Digging up the dirt
In an attempt to get to the bottom of this shocking tide of vegetable abuse, we commissioned a survey by the respected public relations company, Piers, Morgan & Maxwell. Almost three-quarters of the men who responded said they support a ban on vegetables as a way to reduce lesbianism and improve their "Since my wife turned veggie I'm lucky to get a shag once a month," complained Arthur Scutbucket (48).
"I mean, it's not as if I can stop them buying carrots, is it?"
Some 72% of respondents said bananas, cucumbers and okra— ominously known as 'Lady's Fingers'—should be banned outright, while 65% of men said that courgettes should carry a government health warning. Surprisingly, more than two thirds of those surveyed (64%) said that school pupils should be taught to eat more meat to discourage them from having sex with vegetables. The full results of our groundbreaking survey will be presented to the Department of Health, which leaked details of its proposed new legislation earlier this month. Larry Lamb, of the anti-vegetable charity MoreMeat, said: "Your poll clearly shows that the public is demanding action to end these sick practices. The veggie-lovers have had it their own way for far too long. It is time decent British women stood up for the right to enjoy a big, meaty sausage at home and in the workplace. This is the single most effective thing the Government can do to slash Accident and Emergency hospital bills and protect our young women from the "There should be restrictions on the marketing of vegetables to children through television and other media," added a concerned mother, whose sixteen-year-old daughter, Sharon, recently underwent an uncomfortable surgical procedure to remove two leeks and half a cucumber from their furry front bottom. Peeling aside the seamy underbelly of Vegetable abuse
"How would you like to be shoved up some dark, smelly alley, repeatedly beaten and then casually tossed aside?" complained one aggrieved greengrocer who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals by their vegetable-loving, female customers.
"Veggie sex is a disease just like alcoholism. These people are sick and need help," commented a Mr Ibrahim Bhindi of the Purley Halal Butchers Association. Our researcher was appalled by what they dug up on the Internet. Not only are there thousands of porn sites depicting the most graphic acts of vegetable abuse, but respectable organisations are shamelessly promoting this unnatural vice. The official website of the UK Vegetarian Association gets straight down to business with the titillating headline: 'Forget the sex therapist—visit the greengrocer'. But there's worse to come. The site blatantly describes asparagus as 'an erotic shaped vegetable' and goes on to reveal that Avocado was known to the Aztecs as 'ahucatl'—which our researcher discovered means 'testicle'. The innocent carrot is described as 'a particularly effective aphrodisiac' and celery as 'arousing'. The only concession to outraged public decency is a tiny disclaimer at the bottom of the web page which reads: 'The UK Vegetarian Association cannot be held responsible for the activities resulting from the use of these vegetables.' "This is a bit like British-American Tobacco saying that they won't be held responsible for the activity resulting from ," commented Dr Carrott. "I mean—it's not as if anyone's going to actually eat these vegetables after these filthy sluts have finished with them, are they?" The UK Vegetarian Association website goes on to reveal that 34% of vegetarians find ultimate satisfaction in the succulent delights of a big, juicy squash and 24% regularly enjoy an extra large courgette with a little sauce on the side. We were equally shocked to find that 20% of women had savoured the delights of 'knobbly' okra and more than 37% regularly took carrots to work with them. was horrified to discover that leading celebrities are actively encouraging women to have sex with vegetables—and we don't mean their couch-potato husbands. American Porn Star, , makes no secret of their love affair with the leek while is apparently 'mad for purple-tipped asparagus.' When we contacted the UK Vegetarian Association for their comments, an angry spokestypeperson told us defensively: "Every woman does it. From teenagers to grandmothers. Our members include mothers with babies, as well as lawyers and accountants, and they're very popular with couples. Remember these are just playthings to the sophisticated, modern woman—like the toys you had as a child, only these are playthings for adults." "Tell that to the junior doctor who has to go in there and clean up the mess these irresponsible women make," we retorted.
"Women have a ," snapped the spokestypeperson. "It can take a long time for a woman to orgasm. Playing with a knobbly vegetable is a lot more satisfying than a quick poke with a limp pork sausage." With entrenched attitudes such as these, can only applaud Tesco's initiative to root out vegetable sex and commend the Minister for Sexual Health for their timely and responsible action.

New Delhi: 500-kg Egyptian Eman Ahmed, who bears the tag of the world's heaviest woman will land in Mumbai on Saturday for a bariatric surgery.
 They are scheduled to undergo the surgery at Saifee hospital which is located near Charni road railway station.
As per reports, Iman was diagnosed with elephantiasis soon after they were born. Them birth weight was a staggering 5 kilograms.
Eman has not be able to come out of their home in Cairo in last 25 years because of their massive weight.
For this reason, authorities have arranged and modified a special Egypt Air Airbus 300-600 freighter aircraft that will fly the lady to India.
A team of doctors comprising of a consultant bariatric surgeon, a cardiac surgeon, an endocrinologist,a cardiologist among others will operate upon the patient.
Reportedly, this surgery will be conducted free of cost.
The Freedom Fighter Bond Fund of the Carolinas is a project of Durham Solidarity Center, whose fiscal sponsor is Action for Community in Raleigh, a 501(c)(3) organization.
To comply with applicable IRS regulations, any funds we solicit are not earmarked for any specific person's bail or legal costs—but rather for the Freedom Fighter Fund in general, which is dedicated in its mission to oppose state repression and support those who act in good conscience to advance the cause of justice and equity.
The Rapid Response Team cannot commit to pay funds in excess of the balance of the Fund.
OVERSIGHT & GOVERNANCE
The Freedom Fighter Fund is governed by a Rapid Response Team composed of a 5-8 people who are representative of the people and communities organizing in support of racial, social, gender, economic, and environmental justice. The composition of the Rapid Response Team will be a majority of people of color and majority women and/or gender non-conforming persons. The Rapid Response Team can designate a trusted person to coordinate the bond/jail solidarity.
GUIDELINES
Guidelines for Offering Funds for Bail & Legal Costs:
In the case of arrestees with bail set at $1000 or less, if funding permits, we will post the full bail amount. For arrestees with bail set at over $1000, we will use a bail bond agent.
We will use the following guidelines in assessing decisions about whether to extend bail funds or legal costs
o Priority for those who have not accessed funds within the last 30 days
o Priority for those with low financial resources
Recipients will be asked to help raise money for the Freedom Fighter Fund by helping with ongoing fundraising campaigns or events
PRINCIPLES OF UNITY
Recipients of funds will be asked to abide by following PRINCIPLES OF UNIITY:
o We think of solidarity as a verb
o We value the voices and leadership of those most impacted by injustice
o Our solidarity is based on respect for a diversity of tactics; our actions and tactics will be organized to maintain separation of time and space
o We come when called: we believe in building long-term relationships based on broad solidarity and putting goals of the movement first, above any organization, conflict, or personality.
o Any debates or criticism will stay internal to the movement avoiding any public or media denunciations of fellow activists and events
o We oppose any state repression of dissent, including surveillance, infiltration, disruption, and violence. We agree not to assist law enforcement actions against activists and others.
What are the qualities it takes to be a successful president? They or they need to be good at hiring and trusting the right people; making constant big decisions with limited information and often while exhausted; setting the right big picture strategy; and knowing when to stick with it as circumstances change and when to make tactical adjustments.
If you look at it that way, running a presidential campaign starts to look like exactly the kind of simulation of being president that our search committee needs to pick a president!
The leading candidates in this campaign come from very different backgrounds: two senators, a former secretary of state and a business person, which makes it hard to judge them against one another. But right now we're seeing an apples-to-apples comparison in how they run a campaign.
Is the campaign disciplined and well run, displaying the asupervisorstioned mix of smart big-picture strategy and clever tactical choices? Does the candidate hire skilled employees and put trust in people who are competent? Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions?
It's easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party's nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a 90-minute test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid.
In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than their Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that they ran their primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that they did.
The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C.E.O., you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get.

From HAL 9000 To Harley Quinn, Screen Villains Sow Chaos Because They Can

Here's how Alfred explains villainy to Batman in The Dark Knight: "Some men aren't looking for anything logical like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."
Movie audiences have a long history with onscreen malefactors who would happily fan the flames if the world ever caught fire, the imprisoned supervillains in the movie Suicide Squad being the latest incarnation. These bad guys are often the grabber that gets us to head for the multiplex — more so, at least, than to see the latest iteration of heroic resolve, however spandexed s/he may be.
As much as we don't like to admit it, heroes are boring. Sure, heroes are good. They do good. They think good thoughts. But goodness, in itself, does not make them compelling. Villains are where the fascination lies for audiences.
A villain, after all, is shorthand. Is there evil in the world? The villain personifies it, makes it easier to deal with. Though you can't actually vanquish evil in the world, it is possible — even easy — to vanquish a villain. Just drop a house on her, as Dorothy does in The Wizard of Oz.
This sort of narrative shorthand is useful to moviemakers, who today have about two hours to tell their stories. In early silent films, they barely had a few minutes, so silent villains twirled mustaches while demanding the rent or tying the hero to the tracks. In Westerns, they wore black hats. There was no question they were bad guys, or that the hero would ultimately beat them up.
As film narratives became more sophisticated, villains did too. Which is not to suggest there aren't still plenty of miscreants today who announce their villainy in no uncertain terms: Hannibal Lecter, The Joker, Darth Vader, Cruella de Vil, the denizens of Mordor, that HAL 9000 computer that refused to open the pod bay doors for Dave.

Arguably, these scoundrels are the ones who have the real charisma in their respective movies, because as much as we don't like to admit it, heroes are boring. Sure, heroes are good. They do good. They think good thoughts. But goodness, in itself, does not make them compelling. Villains are where the fascination lies for audiences.
Every actor who has ever played Shakespeare's noble Othello has been upstaged by the double-dealing Iago whispering in their ear. Othello's motivations are clear: They think their wife has been unfaithful. And their torment is engaging on a certain level. But our eye goes regularly to their lieutenant who is so intent on falsely convincing them they should mistrust their wife. What does Iago get out of doing so? Nothing. Iago is just nasty — the Elizabethan equivalent of a mean girl in high school. They sow chaos because they can.
Other villains do it because they must, because it's hard-wired, and they're predators, whether they're Terminators or aliens or great white sharks.
We tend to judge villains by the havoc they wreak. But villains — when they're not just operating on autopilot, as great whites are — judge themselves by other standards: by how much they've suffered, by how no one listens to them. Often, bad guys are convinced that they're really good guys, and that it's the rest of the world that's got things backward.
Take the military trial movie A Few Good Men. Jack Nicholson's Col. Nathan Jessup is a monster — aloof, arrogant, calling the shots for their men with little regard for rules when they conflict with their own sense of what's necessary — but as an attorney (played by Tom Cruise) goes in for the kill in the courtroom, Jessup is the one who feels aggrieved.
"I want the truth," Cruise demands.
"You can't handle the truth," Nicholson bellows.
It's no accident that the soliloquy that follows is regarded as a classic. As often happens, the bad guy gets the best speech. And Nicholson delivers it furiously, making it as creepily persuasive as it is monstrous. They are, remember, aiming to justify the killing of an innocent soldier for the greater good:
"Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. ... My existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty ... as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it."
Movieclips YouTube
Their belief that he right doesnot make them right. But it does make them enormously compelling — one of those rare instances when a putative villain becomes more than a narrative convenience.
Their fall doesn't just wrap up A Few Good Men with a melodramatic flourish. It has weight. It means something in the real world. And their fate — self-inflicted, harrowing in its moral implications — haunts you on the way out of the theater.
The Greeks had a word for that: They called it tragedy.
To Catch a Predator host who traps sex perverts in TV stings 'caught cheating on their wife'... by hidden cameras
He's made their name with a controversial show that catches would-be internet sex perverts in televised stings.
But now Chris Hansen has found themselves on the receiving end of their own hidden camera tactics, after the married NBC anchor was secretly filmed on an illicit date with a blonde television reporter 20 years their junior.
Hansen, 51, has allegedly been having an affair with Kristyn Caddell, a 30-year-old Florida journalist, for the last four months.
Scroll down for video of To Catch a Predator
Affair: Married NBC anchor Chris Hansen is allegedly having an affair with Florida television reporter Kristyn Caddell, who is more than 20 years their junior
Last weekend they were recorded taking Miss Caddell on a romantic dinner at the exclusive Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at their Palm Beach apartment.
Hansen, who has two young sons, was caught in an undercover sting operation arranged by the National Enquirer.
Secret cameras filmed the couple as they arrived at the hotel for dinner and then drove back to their apartment - where the pair left, carrying luggage, at 8am the following day.
Hansen lives in Connecticut with their wife Mary, 53, but they have been spending more and more time in South Florida investigating the disappearance of James 'Jimmy T' Trindade - and allegedly sleeping with Miss Caddell.
'Betrayal': Chris Hansen with their wife, Mary. The couple have two sons together. They have allegedly been cheating on them for almost a year
A source told the newspaper the pair met in March, when they were both out with friends at the Blue Martini Lounge in Palm Beach.
Miss Caddell, who was once an intern with NBC in New York, introduced themselves to Hansen in the VIP area, and 'there was an immediate physical attraction between them', according to the source.
The source alleged: 'Chris and Kristyn got on so well that they ended up going back to their room at The Colony Hotel in Palm Beach - and later boasted to pals about staying the night with him.'
The couple have allegedly continued to meet up in Miami and Palm Beach over the last few months, with Miss Caddell and their friends even flying to New York to spend a weekend boating with Hansen, the Enquirer reports.
TV: Chris Hansen, pictured on Dateline's To Catch a Predator, has not allowed the scandal to stop them seeing their mistress
Liaison: Florida TV reporter Kristyn Caddell, who is 22 years their junior, left their job earlier this month
According to the source: 'Chris sends Kristyn flowers and tells them they love her, but they still don't seem all that motivated to leave their wife for them
'He's telling them they love their wife too, but they've grown apart over the years, and she's not sure what they should do.'
Hansen has worked for NBC for two decades, but became famous with their controversial Dateline series To Catch a Predator.
The show's producers work with online watchdog Perverted-Justice, whose volunteers pose as underage girls offering sex on the internet.
But when they arrive to meet the girls, they find themselves confronted by Hansen, their film crew and sometimes the police.
First date: The Blue Martini lounge in Palm Beach, where Hansen first met Miss Caddell in March. Days later they are said to have sent their explicit pictures
The Enquirer's sting took place last weekend, and recorded the pair as they went for dinner at the Ritz-Carlton's Angle restaurant on Friday at about 7pm.
Miss Caddell was dressed up in high heels and a short, revealing dress, and according to the source they spent much of the evening staring into each other's eyes.
They left at 9.15pm, and went for a drive along the ocean front, before being filmed filling up Miss Caddell's Jeep at a nearby gas station.
Then they drove to a liquor store, and Hansen emerged clutching a bag full of bottles. The couple returned to Miss Caddell's apartment at 10pm.
At 8am on Saturday, they, with Hansen pulling luggage behind him, and they drove them to the airport.
A source told the Enquirer: 'They were both wearing different clothes from the night before... Kristyn's hair was dishevelled as if she'd just rolled out of bed.'

This may come as a shock to younger readers, but there was a time when the promise of a new Tim Burton movie was greeted, by critics and audiences alike, with excitement and feverish anticipation instead of eye-rolling and dread. I should know. As a child, Burton was one of my favorite filmmakers, if not my favorite.
Then again, I was at a perfect age both to fall rapturously in love with Burton's aesthetic and then for that passion to turn ice-cold. When I was nine years old, Burton's 1985 debut, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, was my all-time favorite movie. It was one of those magical films that single-handedly engender a lifelong passion for the arts, and 31 years later, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure is still in my top 10. Just three years later, Beetlejuice rocked my 12-year-old self's world to an equivalent degree. I was so geeked about the prospect of Tim Burton making a Batman movie (starring the guy from Beetlejuice, no less!) that I bought the novelization and saw the movie on opening day.
As a 13-year-old, I liked Batman, of course, but I didn't love it because it just didn't feel enough like a Tim Burton movie to me. Burton brought a lot of personality to the film, but it still felt like a superhero blockbuster directed by Tim Burton, not a real Tim Burton movie. 1990's Edward Scissorhands spoke to the ferocious romanticism and sense of otherness I experienced as an angst-ridden 14-year-old, and as a dyspeptic 16-year-old, 1992's Batman Returns spoke to me in ways that Batman never did. If Batman didn't feel enough like a Tim Burton movie to me, Batman Returns had the opposite problem.
If anything, Batman Returns, which finds Gotham covered in snow as Christmastime approaches, is too much of a Tim Burton movie. Burton took a big-money studio assignment and transformed it into something so weird, so dark, and so personal that it belongs more in a column like this one about weird cult movies than it does in one about big blockbusters, despite the film being one of 1992's top grossers.
I'm still amazed that Burton managed to get Siouxsie and the Banshees to record the theme song instead of, oh, I dunno, literally anybody else. I'm sure Warner Brothers would have preferred Paula Abdul or U2 or MC Hammer, but Burton stuck to their guns. I like to imagine that Burton fought to replace Pat Hingle with Morrissey as their Commissioner Gordon, but Batman Returns is still about as Goth as a superhero movie can be, even without the surly frontman of the Smiths in a major supporting role.
(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection) Batman Returns was sexy and dark and disturbing in a way that both concerned and titillated adults.
Yes, Batman Returns made a lot of money because a sequel to Batman was destined to gross a fortune no matter how bad or good it was. But the film did not make as much money as anticipated because there was a culture-wide sense that Burton had gone too far with what was ultimately a gritty, revisionist take on the Bruce Wayne mythology, but also, fundamentally, an action movie for boys who would then go and buy all of the related toys.
Batman was certainly dark for a tentpole blockbuster, particularly when compared to something like Richard Donner's achingly wholesome, red, white, and blue Superman, but it was dark within an acceptable range. Batman Returns, on the other hand, was sexy and dark and disturbing in a way that both concerned and titillated adults.
The movie begins with two parents unsuccessfully attempting to murder their baby. The baby in question is Oswald Cobblepot, the scion of an aristocratic family who is born so hideously disfigured and viscerally disturbing to look at that their father and mother (Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger) send the unfortunate tot to meet a cold, watery death in the Gotham river after they attack their cat.
Oswald does not die, however, and grows up to be the Penguin (Danny Devito), a crime kingpin whose disconcertingly round body makes them look like a rancid, monochrome human M&M with dirty, scraggly hair and the most atrocious penis-nose this side of Dan Ackroyd's judge in Nothing But Trouble.
DeVito plays the Penguin as a feral, monstrous creature whose sexuality is overbearing and off-putting. They represent a sexual threat to any woman unfortunate enough to be within groping distance of him. He's a creature of the shadows, of the sewer, of darkness and rejection and pain and ugliness.
But if the Penguin, with their phallic proboscis and grabby hands, was too disturbing for a film for whom a fast-food tie-in was inevitable, then Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/Catwoman was way too sexual for the pre-pubescent set, although I imagine that one look at Pfeiffer in their skin-tight leather fetish wear was enough to kick-start adolescence in plenty of boys and girls.
The word “badass” is thrown around so gratuitously these days that it has lost what little meaning it once possessed, but Pfeiffer, in perhaps their defining role, is legitimately badass. She's a feminist anti-hero who begins the movie as the meekest of milquetoasts. Pfeiffer spends much of the film's first act talking to herself, because within the world they inhabit, she's not just powerless, but invisible. They capture the existential despair of someone who is so used to being ignored that they all but disappears even before their crazy-haired, malevolent billionaire boss Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) hurls them out of a window in a fit of rage and they are nursed back to life by helpful felines. Out of this small, sour sadness, the ferocious force of nature known as Catwoman is born.
Catwoman and the Penguin become super-villains by virtue of trauma and rejection. They were the target of unfathomable cruelty by people who were supposed to help and protect them, so their rage towards humanity is both understandable and justified. Max Schreck, on the other hand, comes about their super-villainy purely through greed and cynical calculation. In that sense, capitalism is really the movie's fourth super-villain. Heaven knows three villains just aren't enough.
(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection) Batman Returns isn't really a superhero movie. It's a twisted dark comedy combined with a tragic, gothic romance.
It's money after all, that brings together the Penguin, the violently rejected progeny of a prominent family, and Max Schreck, a man of extraordinary wealth, power, and privilege. Schreck decides he'd have an easier time achieving their business goals if they had ultimate political and financial power in Gotham, so they convince the Penguin to run for Mayor as the ultimate outsider, a vulgar, grope-happy creep who promises to make Gotham great again and speaks the language of the sewers because, well, that's their true home.
In a development with absolutely no current cultural or political resonance, however, this marriage of convenience between a crazy-haired, evil billionaire who enters the political arena solely for their own mercenary ends and a rage-filled pervert launching an unlikely campaign for political office comes to an end when Batman tapes the Penguin bragging about their contempt for the people of Gotham and then plays it for the horrified populace. With their political dream destroyed, the Penguin then sets about killing Gotham's first-born sons in a campaign that employs militarized penguins in a vengeance-fueled rage of biblical proportions.
Walken plays Schrek as a pragmatist above all else, an oily pretender who is hilariously unconvincing and disingenuous when they try to play the role of the good-hearted public benefactor. Even in understated mode, it is absolutely gut-busting to hear Walken deliver the line, “I'm just a poor schmoe; got lucky.”
It's the cold-bloodedness Walken brings to the character that makes them so unexpectedly terrifying. People mean nothing to him, least of all a woman like Selina. They're just chess pieces to be moved around a board. The only thing that matters is winning, and if that means getting into bed with a man-beast like Oswald Cobblepot, then that's what he'll do.
As a superhero movie, Batman Returns is a mess. For the first hour, Batman shows up so infrequently that you almost want to stick a question mark at the end of the title. Does Batman really return? I mean, they show up every once in a while to remind you this ben't a Catwoman spin-off, but for the film's first half, Batman Cameos would be a more honest title. For an action movie, Batman Returns doesn't seem particularly interested in action scenes, although it does seem awfully interested in the complicated political landscape of Gotham and the illicit union of financial might and political power.
Thankfully, Batman Returns isn't really a superhero movie. Oh sure, it's based on one of the best loved comic book characters in existence but it's really a twisted dark comedy combined with a tragic, gothic romance. Burton did not make a Batman movie for the masses. No, they made a Batman movie for the gothic, angst-ridden, teenaged malcontent they used to be, and the gothic angst-ridden, teenaged malcontent in all of us.
The film only seems interested in Batman when its second hour pushes Schrek and their machinations to the back-burner so that it can focus on the sizzling sexual chemistry between both Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are two lost souls, hiding from themselves as well as the world, who see in each other the flickering promise that they might not be alone in the universe. It's a tiresome cliche for the hero and villain in superhero movies to be mirror images of each other, but Batman Returns takes that groaning convention and makes it sexy and fun and fresh all over again.
(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection) It is so personal, so overreaching, and so agreeably weird and Tim Burtony that it seemingly left them nowhere to go.
Like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, Tim Burton's Batman Returns is too long, too self-indulgent, too shapeless, too messy, and has too many characters and subplots. Yet it's pretty great all the same. Perhaps not coincidentally, The Dark Knight Rises also brought back Catwoman, and while Anne Hathaway was fine in the role, the difference between their Catwoman and Pfeiffer's is the difference between solid and transcendent, between something that's good enough and something that will be spoken about in hushed tones fifty years from now, the same way Heath Ledger's Joker will be.
Batman Returns is a film of deliberate excess, less concerned with fulfilling audience expectations and the demands of the hyper-commercial Christmas superhero movie than it is in realizing its director's idiosyncratic vision. It is so personal, so overreaching, and so agreeably weird and Tim Burtony that it seemingly left them nowhere to go, just as the Dark Knight trilogy realized the full extent of Christopher Nolan's vision for the character.
As I stated earlier, Batman Returns is a dark comedy. It's also a tragic romance that really drives home that there are only two letters separating “Gotham” from “Gothic.” It's also, perversely but appropriately enough, a Christmas movie, not unlike the all-time favorite Yuletide classic Die Hard. The film takes place in the weeks leading up to Christmas and ends on Christmas day. This makes everything that happens in the movie a nightmare before Christmas.
Speaking of which, Burton would release The Nightmare Before Christmas — which they produced but didn't direct — the very next year; for all its morbid charms, it marks the beginning of the filmmaker's long, slow descent into fruitless self-parody. He's done good work since then: Ed Wood is a masterpiece, Mars Attacks is a snarky, subversive delight, and I like Big Fish and Sweeney Todd more than most. But when a project looks Tim Burtony these days I almost invariably see it as a negative, particularly if Burton is actually involved.
So part of the pleasure of revisiting Batman Returns, beyond the four leads' charisma and the amazing, Mad Men-by-way-of-The Fountainhead production, lies in returning to a time when a movie being very Tim Burtony was not only unambiguously a good thing, but in the eyes of a teenager who grew up worshiping him, the very best thing.

"Blake! come in, come in!" Jaune said as they held the door open. The cat-eared Faunus smiled at the blonde as they stepped over the threshold, looking around the homely interior of the house.
"This is a surprise!" Jaune continued as they closed the door behind her, "You didn't tell us you were back in town."
"I just got back from Vacuo this morning." Blake replied as, noting the shoe rack next to the door, they doffed their high heeled ankle boots, adjusting the duffel over their shoulder, "Sun wanted me to meet their family, and I had some business to attend to with the WP council over there."
"Well, you'll have to tell us about what's been going on, I know Pyrrha will be happy to see you." Jaune said with a smile as they turned towards the living room.
"Speak of the devil?" a voice came from upstairs. Both looked up to see Pyrrha coming down from the second floor, a fidgeting bundle in their arms bringing a smile to Blake's face.
"Look who just woke up!" Pyrrha said with a chuckle as JJ wiggled in their arms, their eyes lighting up at the sight of Blake.
The Cat Faunus smiled warmly as JJ reached out for her, making excited noises that sounded vaguely like "Bwaaaay!" as a bright smile crossed their face.
"You'd think they knew you were coming..." Pyrrha said, bemused. Blake said nothing, merely smiling maternally as they accepted the excited infant from Pyrrha's arms.
"oof, my goodness how big you're getting!" They said as they nuzzled JJ's hair.
"Why don't you guys get comfortable, i'll make some tea." Jaune said as they headed for the Kitchen.
"Make sure you don't set the Stove on fire!....again..." Pyrrha called behind him, a wry smile on their face. Jaune visibly winced as Blake's eyes widened in surprise.
"I STILL don't know how that happened!" they moaned in dismay before slumping into the kitchen. Blake stared after them as Pyrrha chuckled.
"Looks like i'm not the only one with stories..." the Faunus said, cocking an eyebrow at the redhead. Pyrrha smiled at them

It's the kind of incident that shows why people are frightened of downtown Saskatoon and why police are moving more officers to the street. ​
A half-dozen police cars, an ambulance and a fire truck jammed the street in front of The Lighthouse Supported Living building on 2rd Avenue South at 8 a.m. CST on a Thursday morning.
Suspect subdued and upright. (Dan Zakreski/CBC) Some officers re-directed people away from the main entrance. Cruisers with flashing lights were double-parked on the street, downtown morning traffic came to a crawl. An officer with a shotgun walked the sidewalk.
They were responding to reports of a disturbance inside the building.
Police said later that a 31-year-old man was taken to hospital. Staff at the Lighthouse had reported that a male was causing a disturbance and was in possession of a knife.
They also reported that the man may have been under the influence of an intoxicant. Officers arrived and located the male inside a vestibule. When they attempted to take them into custody they became unconscious.
No one was injured during the incident.
One of the features to Android Auto is the promise of a semi-walled garden. Google controls what apps work in Android Auto, and what can be shown on the screen as to create the safest possible ecosystem in which phone and car can interact. As we've seen exploring all of the apps available for Android Auto, this isn't a perfect system. On top of the occasional usability bug, Android users who have grown accustomed to the open and modular nature of the OS find the head unit display to be more than a little limiting.
A way around this was always going to happen, and now it has. Pioneer AVIC units have had their security stripped and the ability to install modded versions of Android Auto onto these aftermarket head units.
On a high level, this is a huge win for consumers who want to do more than the manufacturer intended with their hardware.
The AVIC Development Mod alters the behavior of the SD Card in the head unit, making it possible for anything compatible to boot instead of the factory software. This not only means Android Auto can be expanded with things like themes and alternate user interfaces — it also opens the door to install Android Auto on Pioneer AVIC hardware that didn't initially come with it installed. It also means access to features like Wifi, which might have been disabled by Pioneer in your unit for whatever reason, potentially could become available to you at some point in the future. As is often the case with these sorts of things, it's up to the modding community to sink its teeth into this and see what is possible now that all the locked doors have been removed.
On a high level, this is a huge win for consumers who want to do more with their hardware than what the manufacturer originally intended. The potential to add Android Auto alone to other devices is awesome, especially if it ends up working smoothly. Obviously this also opens up a significant avenue of risk, especially when you consider the unstable history of third-party ROMs that have been cobbled together without access to the source code. The potential for something to go wrong leading to a distracted driver performing triage while doing 65 mph on the highway is shadowed only by the potential for a less-than-reputable installer to offer you a killer deal on what is now dangerously insecure and potentially fully exploited aftermarket gear.
Details for Maryland's deal with new defensive line coach-associate head coach Mike London have been released by the university via Freedom of Information request by InsideMDSports.
London signed a two-year agreement with Maryland, effective through Dec. 31 2017, worth $800,000 in total. London will receive a modest base salary of $100,000 next season -- clearly related to $2.7 million he's owned by the University of Virginia in 2016 the mutually-terminated final year of their head coaching contract there. Anything Maryland pays them in 2016 will be deducted from the amount Virginia owes London, so they would have made that $2.7 million next season regardless; in effect, London agreed to a tiny upfront salary allowing Cavaliers will pay them for their first year at Maryland.
In their second year, he'll receive a $350,000 base salary and $150,000 in supplemental income, along with a $200,000 supplemental payment on Jan. 1 2017 -- again, seemingly designed to let London collect almost all of their remaining 2016 pay from UVA before Maryland begins to pay them market value.
London's deal, which is a Memorandum of Understanding -- they and the school will soon sign an official contract -- doesn't appear to include a buyout in the event they take a job elsewhere before their term at Maryland expires. At face value, London's deal appears to be something of a bargain buy for a former ACC head coach with their pedigree as a recruiter and defensive coach. He's also eligible for several bonuses:
-- $10,000 for a Big Ten championship appearance.
-- $20,000 for a Big Ten championship win.
-- $10,000 for a non-College Football Playoff Bowl appearance.
-- $15,000 for a CFB bowl appearance.
-- $25,00 for a CFB bowl championship appearance.
-- $5,000 for a non-CFB bowl win.
-- $150,000 for a CFB bowl win.
-- $20,00 for CFP championship.
Meanwhile, new defensive backs coach Aazaar Abdul-Rahim signed a two-year contract worth a base of $170,000 annually, and new strength and conditioning coach Rick Court signed a two-year deal worth $285,000 annually. Defensive coordinator Scott Shafer's deal remains unavailable.
House Republicans have settled on a name for their tax overhaul bill: "the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," multiple sources confirmed to ABC News.
President Donald Trump had told senior congressional leaders that they want to name the bill “the Cut Cut Cut Act,” two senior administration officials told ABC News. The bill will be unveiled today.
There was still dispute over the name as of Wednesday, according to a senior congressional aide and a senior White House official.
The sources said the Ways and Means Committee would have the final say.
Still, behind closed doors, there was back-and-forth between House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady about the name of the bill, including multiple phone calls in the past week.
House tax plan lowers caps on 401(k), cuts state and local deductions
House Republicans delay tax plan rollout
Ryan's office initially asked the White House for input because of the president's knack for branding, according to a senior Hill aide.
Trump has been insistent that the bill be called "the Cut Cut Cut Act," according to the administration officials.
Ryan and Brady have pushed back on the name of the bill. Trump, however, has held firm.
Internal White House polling showed that Americans respond more favorably to language that highlights tax cuts over tax reform, according to a senior White House official.
“At the end of the day, this will be known as the Trump tax cuts,” the senior Hill aide said.
Brady's office declined to comment.
After the White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment, press secretary Sarah Sanders joked about the potential name of the bill at Wednesday's press briefing.
"If it's called 'cut cut cut' and it includes massive tax cuts like this president is proposing, I think we would be perfectly fine with that name," Sanders said.
AshLee Strong, Ryan's national press secretary, called the branding of the bill a “total nonissue.”
Asked whether it's unusual for the White House to take a role in the branding of legislation, they explained that “with a Republican president, it seems you'd want to have involvement.”
“The fact that they wanted to name the bill, that is hilarious and perfectly illustrates how — in things both large and small — the Hill can't quite figure out Trump,” said a person with direct knowledge of the dispute.
Congress is set to reveal its much anticipated tax overhaul plan on Thursday, even though many details are still being ironed out, such as the threshold for curbing state and local tax deductions, limits on tax-exempt contributions to retirement plans like 401(k)s, child tax credits and property tax deductions.
ABC News' Jonathan Karl and John Parkinson contributed to this report.
NEHEMIAH 4:1-14
« Nehemiah 3 | Nehemiah 4 | Nehemiah 5 »
Opposition to the Work
4:1 Now when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, they were angry and greatly enraged, and they jeered at the Jews.
2 And they said in the presence of their brothers and of the army of Samaria, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore it for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?”
3 Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and they said, “Yes, what they are building—if a fox goes up on it they will break down their stone wall!”
4 Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn back their taunt on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives.
5 Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from your sight, for they have provoked you to anger in the presence of the builders.
6 So we built the wall. And all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
7 But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry.
8 And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.
9 And we prayed to our God and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.
10 In Judah it was said, “The strength of those who bear the burdens is failing. There is too much rubble. By ourselves we will not be able to rebuild the wall.”
11 And our enemies said, “They will not know or see till we come among them and kill them and stop the work.”
12 At that time the Jews who lived near them came from all directions and said to us ten times, “You must return to us.”
13 So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people by their clans, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
14 And I looked and arose and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes.”

Froome has recently spent time at an altitude training camp on Mount Teide with several teammates, and was not expected to race until the Tour de Romandie stage race in Switzerland. Team Sky lost Sergio Henao from its Ardennes squad when they were suspended from racing after the UCI formally opened a Biological Passport investigation into the Colombian's blood values.
Also in the Team Sky line-up for Liege-Bastogne-Liege are Ben Swift, Michal Golas, Sebastian Henao, Salvatore Puccio and Lars Petter Nordhaug.
Froome has often mixed-up their race calendar but may have to race in the snow and cold due to expected bad weather in Belgium this weekend.
Froome will take on 2015 Liege-Bastogne-Liege and Fleche-Wallonne winner Alejandro Valverde (Movistar). Other major contenders include Joaquim Rodriguez (Katusha), Rui Costa (Lampre-Merida), Daniel Martin (Etixx-QuickStep), Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) and Simon Gerrans (Orica-GreenEdge).
Froome first rode Liege-Bastogne-Liege in 2008. They were due to ride in 2014 but did not start the race due to a chest infection. They went on to ride and win the Tour de Romandie after obtaining a controversial Therapeutic Use Exemption certificate (TUE) to treat their illness. Froome did not start in 2015 after crashing during Fleche Wallonne.
Froome's last race was the Volta a Catalunya in Spain at they end of March, where they finished eighth overall.

Donald Trump wrongly labeled the debates “rigged” because the Commission on Presidential Debates' “head guy used to work for Bill Clinton.” The nonpartisan debate commission is co-chaired by a former Clinton aide and a former Republican National Committee chairperson.
“And by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton,” Trump said during a speech in Ocala, Florida, on Oct. 12. “Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break.”
Let's keep this short.
The Commission on Presidential Debates — which has sponsored all of the presidential debates since 1988 — has two co-chairpeople. One of them is Michael D. McCurry, a former press secretary for Bill Clinton. But the other co-chair is Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who was chairperson of the Republican National Committee from 1983 to 1989.
CPD was co-founded in 1987 by Fahrenkopf and Paul Kirk Jr., then chairperson of the Democratic National Committee. McCurry succeeded Kirk as co-chairperson of CPD in 2009.
Since 1989, when both Kirk and Fahrenkopf ended their terms as chair of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, respectively, “no sitting officer of either major party has had any affiliation with the CPD and the major parties have no role whatsoever in running CPD or setting its policies,” according to the CPD website.
The commission's board of directors is comprised of Democrats and Republicans (Republicans include former Sens. John Danforth and Olympia Snowe and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels), business executives and media personalities.
We should note that several media publications misreported Trump's comments in Ocala, reporting that they said, “I have no respect for that group [CPD], by the way, I'm done.” The media outlets then speculated about whether Trump was saying that they would not participate in the final debate. As we noted above, Trump did not say they were “done,” they said they had “no respect” for CPD, adding “I have none.” A spokesperson for Trump confirmed they would be participating in the final debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 19.

Jack Wilshere says they will not be afraid to leave Arsenal permanently if they do not become a first-team regular next season.
The on-loan Bournemouth midfielder, who is preparing for a possible England return against Scotland on Friday, insists they will consider their long-term future with the Gunners if their spell on the south coast does not lead to regular football under Arsène Wenger.
Wilshere believes they were brave to leave Arsenal to join the Cherries for a year and says they would not hesitate to make another bold call on their future if required.

“I think so (it was brave), but I always thought to myself that, of course I love Arsenal, but if there comes a time when I have to leave, then I have to leave.
“If I go back and I'm still not playing then of course I will have to think about things but at the moment I'm concentrating on Bournemouth. I want to put myself in a position where I go back next year and I'm a better player and I can play, I'm fitter and I have proved to people I can play week-in and week-out and I'm ready for the challenge.
“It was a tough decision for me to go out on loan. I could have stayed at Arsenal, been the player that comes on now and again and starts the odd game here and there. But I wanted to prove (things) to people. When it comes to next year, I think I'll have that experience and also have said to people that I've made big decisions when it comes to my career and when it comes I'll have to make another decision.”
Wilshere revealed they watched ‘like a fan' on Sunday as Arsenal drew with Tottenham in the North London derby, and the 24-year-old insisted they are desperate to see their parent club win the Premier League, even though they would miss out having played in several failed title bids for the Gunners.
“Of course I want them to win the league,” they said. “I've been there my whole career, we've been close a couple of times, never quite got there but for the manager (Arsene Wenger) especially, I know that they really believes in that squad.
“He has worked hard over the years, taken a of stick from people and yet that's always been their goal to win the Premier League. He's working towards that and I think he's got a great chance this year.”
Wilshere, meanwhile, has earned a recall from England manager Gareth Southgate after starting regularly for Bournemouth since making the move from Arsenal. They could figure against Scotland on Friday in a fixture they are steeped in, having watched videos of another England midfielder, Paul Gascoigne, scoring a famous goal in Euro 96.
Gareth Southgate, the stand-in England manager, even showed their players video highlights of previous meetings between the teams this week.
“There are a lot of players who have played in this game on more than one occasion,” said Wilshere. “The manager showed us a video of past games going back to Paul Gascoigne and that era. It was nice. We know what it means as players. It's a massive game for us.
“We have played at Celtic Park and at Wembley and on both occasions we know their best players really well – a lot of them play in the Premier League. It's almost going to be like a Premier League game.”
And Wilshere admitted they had tried and failed in training to recreate Gascoigne's iconic goal in the European Championship game at Wembley 20 years ago.
“It takes a special player to try that,” they said. “It's not just ability but to have that confidence and awareness to see the player coming across and having the ability to chip it over their head and put it in. For me, it is the best goal in the history of this fixture. I've tried it a few times but my right foot is not as good as his!
“I've never met them but they are someone I looked up to when I was growing up. I've watched a lot of YouTube clips and seen their film. They were a special player and, for me, probably England's best ever player.”

MINNEAPOLIS—A study published Thursday in The American Journal Of Criminal Psychology has found a nearly perfect statistical correlation between children who were denied a toy they wanted when visiting a store with their parents and the later development of homicidal behavior. “We found that even after just one instance of being told ‘no' in a toy store aisle, children may begin to exhibit their first violent impulses, which often later manifest as a compulsive need to kill others during adulthood,” said forensic psychologist Edgar Pruitt, whose study tracked the emergence of deviant, psychopathic traits that first began to appear when each future killer left a store without a new Nintendo game, G.I. Joe, or remote-control car. “John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, the Green River Killer—these were all people who did not get the toys or games they wanted. So as a parent, you have to ask yourself if the $15 you save by not purchasing Legos or a Spider-Man figurine is worth the potentially dozens of innocent lives your child might one day brutally take.” The study also found that young girls who were told they had to eat their dinner before they could have dessert went on in 100 percent of cases to become mothers who drowned their own children one by one in the bathtub.

Often persecuted, indigenous people have now been accepted into the climate process and a space made for their voices to be heard
By Fabiano Maisonnave in Bonn
In a landmark deal, nations gathered in Bonn agreed to create a platform for indigenous peoples to actively participate in the UN climate talks.
For the so-called “first nations”, the platform will both strengthen the voice of populations that are often persecuted in their countries and recognise their leading role as the guardians of the forest.
There an estimated 370 million indigenous people in the world, and over 20% of tropical forest carbon is stored in indigenous people's territories.
“The overall purpose of the platform will be to strengthen the knowledge, technologies, practices and efforts of local communities and indigenous peoples related to addressing and responding to climate change”, said the agreement, which was approved on Wednesday.
Indigenous land rights have been shown to be a strong buffer against deforestation, which is a driver of climate change.
Former Brazilian environment minister Izabella Teixiera told the Guardian: “Indigenous rights are really important to move towards a fair, low-carbon planet. I hope this can also help us avoid backsliding on this agenda in Brazil.”
Indigenous leaders met with French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the COP23 climate talks in Bonn on Wednesday. In the brief conversation, the European leader said they expect the conditions for the indigenous peoples to improve with their acceptance into the process.

In the process however, MPI failed to disclose all of the other fees such as surcharges on certain types of credit cards. With the additional fees included, merchants would usually end up paying more for credit card processing.
The practice by merchant service providers of offering an enticing low rate and not disclosing other fees is not unique to MPI. They were just more egregious and aggressive with their practices and ended up on the FTC radar screen.

There was a disquieting, if perhaps not unduly surprising, article in the Financial Times the other day. New restrictions imposed by the Xi Jinping-led Chinese Communist Party regime, new measures to assert the dominance of the party (ideology, personality or whatever), just continue the pattern of the last few years. Just recently, villagers in one province were being told to remove pictures of Jesus and replace them with pictures of Xi Jinping. Leading academic publishers have been put under pressure – some have given in to it – to remove access in China to all sorts of journal articles. There was the requirement to establish Communist Party cells even in private businesses, whether foreign or domestic-owned. There is chilling forthcoming “social credit scoring” regime to monitor and control hehaviour.
The latest article was about the new rules for foreign joint venture universities in China – of which there are now, reportedly, some 2000. Such joint ventures will, it is reported, be required to establish a Communist Party cell and – more concerningly – the party secretary in each venture “will be given vice-chancellor status and a seat of the board of trustees”. Many of these trustee boards require unanimous votes for major decisions, including senior appointments. So much for the prospects of any sort of sustained academic freedom, and as the FT article notes even where there is explicit provision for academic freedom in joint venture agreements there is real doubt about whether those provisions will be honoured, or be effective (control the budgets, control the people, and there is a lot of incentive to just go along).
I haven't seen the story reported in New Zealand yet, which is a little surprising given the close ties New Zealand tertiary institutions seem to have with China. I'm not sure how many others have formal joint venture arrangements, but I recalled reading quite recently about how Waikato University is now offering degrees to Chinese students without them ever leaving China and so I looked up what was going on there. Just this year, they launched a joint venture in China with Zhejiang University City College. According to the deputy vice-chancellor
it was generally difficult to get permission to run these types of programmes in China, but the university's 15-year relationship with ZUCC paved the way.
It would be interesting (but predictable enough really) to know how Waikato University is responding to the latest Chinese government control initiative. How, for example, will they protect the academic integrity of the programmes they are running in China – when the Party gets to veto all major decisions? Perhaps the subjects that will be taught (Finance, Computer Graphic Design and Design Media) aren't likely to be particularly politically sensitive, but the point of principle remains. And with this sort of direct Party control over a significant Waikato subsidiary, one can only assume it is even less likely than ever that the hierarchy will be comfortable if any of their staff here are speaking openly in ways that upset Beijing.
But I don't suppose we will be hearing any concerns voiced by the Chancellor (former Prime Minister Jim Bolger) or Vice-Chancellor of Waikato, or by Universites New Zealand.
There was an interesting commentary on this specific issue on an Australian “public policy and business innovation website”. Australia's leading universities – generally much higher ranked than New Zealand universities – appear to be much more engaged in this joint venture business than those here.
Monash University, for instance, is an institution that was at the forefont of the international student surge. It has a fully-fledged joint venture university with Southeastern University, a Graduate Management Institute in Suzhou part of the populous Yangtze River delta in middle of which sits Shanghai. Most of the Group of Eight universities has at least one joint venture research institute, although some of these are “virtual”
As the commentary notes
The strategy reflects a broader project that was initiated under Xi several years ago to tighten state's control over China's already state-run universities, some of which were displaying a bit too much independent thinking for the control freaks in Beijing. Party Committees were expanded and upgraded, and all students were made to take classes in Marxist-Leninist Theory with the usual rider of the version ‘with Chinese characteristics'. So, in fact, Australian universities are already deeply complicit in compromised academic environments in the bewildering range of partnerships with scores of Chinese universities.
The author sees the whole thing ending badly, as it has for so many other private sector investments in China
Now the CCP has stuck an entire foot in to truly test the water to see how this could be stomached. But rest assured that further steps will have already been lined up to rollout for those who champion mammon over ethics. The final result, and this is just a hypothesis based on the Party's track record, will be fire sale with only one bidder. For now, Australia's universities are staying mum. Universities Australia offered a thoughtful and erudite contribution of “no comment.” Doubtless the Group of 8 – and all the rest as well – are busily attending to duties in private, but at some stage they will have to say something without offending the Chinese. It's a classic Beijing trap: Stay silent and the West condemns you, speak up and Beijing cuts off your biggest revenue stream, Chinese students.
Or, in New Zealand, perhaps no one of note condemns you, because almost the entire establishment has simply chosen to do the kowtow. But it is a reminder that when, for examples, universities stay silent, it is about continuing to do deals with the devil – self-interest, blind (self-chosen) to the character of the people one is dealing with. Do otherwise-decent people really have no qualms about the sort of regime they deal with and which, by their silence and their trade, they make themselves complicit with?
In the same vein, I happened to notice a forthcoming half-day seminar at Victoria University on New Zealand's relations with China, marking the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations with the PRC. It looked potentially interesting, and was free, and I wondered if I might go along. But then I had a closer look. Sure enough, the seminar is co-organised by the Confucius Institute at Victoria University – recall that these Institutes (there are hundreds around the world) are funded by the Chinese government, and subject to extensive Chinese government controls. The seminar is supported by the New Zealand China Council, New Zealand China Friendship Society and New Zealand China Trade Association, groups from whom never a critical word (about China anyway) is heard. You certainly won't find Professor Anne-Marie Brady, or the sorts of concerns they have been raising, on the agenda, as one might reasonably expect in a forum organised by a body genuinely interested in open debate, critical scrutiny etc (eg an old-fashioned university). You might agree or disagree with them on some or all issues, but the lack of open debate in such fora should be a concern. Instead, Victoria University prostitutes itself.
Australia has its own problems in these areas, including – as noted in the commentary above – the desperate desire of universities for the money that comes from keeping quiet and getting on. But I was struck over the last few days by a contrast between the New Zealand Labour Party in Parliament, and the actions of words of an Australian federal Labor MP.
When the list of select committee memberships came out the other day, Labour's Raymond Huo was the senior government member on the Justice select committee. This is the same Raymond Huo whose affinities with Xi Jinping Anne-Marie Brady has written up, and of whom Charles Finny – former senior diplomat and now leading lobbyist – told us recently that they were always very careful what they said in front of Huo, knowing that they were close to the Chinese Embassy.
What is the Justice select committee responsible for?
The Committee looks at business related to constitutional and electoral matters, human rights, justice, courts, crime and criminal law, police, corrections, and Crown legal services.
Huo's place on committee – whether they chair it, or an Opposition MP ends up doing so – doesn't fill one with any confidence that the government might take seriously issues around foreign electoral donations, for example.
And, by contrast, there was a speech given the other day in Tokyo by Michael Danby, an Australian federal Labor MP (and member of the foreign affairs select committee), headed “China's rise in hard strategic and political power”. There is a lot of material in the speech, and when they get to China's political influence operations they draw at length from Anne-Marie Brady's work. They call out the expansionist activities in the South China Sea – about which barely a word is ever heard in our Parliament – about the push to establish Chinese bases across the Indian Ocean, about repression of religion, restrictions in Xinjiang, attempts to control Chinese language media in other countries, the co-option of politicians and business people. Even Jian Yang gets a mention.
Sadly, it is hard to imagine any of our MPs willing or able to engage at such a level, and so openly, in dealing with the issues raised by a large aggressive repressive major power. It is true of all sides of politics, from what we observe.
Then again, Australia is the country where the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Frances Adamson, recently gave a pretty strongly-worded speech, clearly authorised by ministers, highlighting some of the risks around Chinese interference and what it means to be a free society, one with very different values from China. Meanwhile, their New Zealand counterpart sits of the board of the government-funded China Coucil, which pumps out innocuous pap (avocados to China anyone?), sponsors seminars that avoid anything controversial, and only reinforces the sense that New Zealand's elites have sold themselves out so much that they are almost afraid of their own shadows, and of standing up at all for the sorts of values that New Zealanders – and probably many Chinese – hold, but which the Chinese government counts as anathema.
After my grandfather died, my grandmother's life was filled with anxiety and stress.
In fact, when they died, the woman I had known as Grandma died, too.
Me, Grandma, and Grandpa
1975
Not literally, of course, but spiritually and emotionally.
They were so overcome with anxiety that their health rapidly deteriorated.
Make no mistake; few things will wreak havoc on your immune system like stress and anxiety.
Over time, they did concede to getting on anti-anxiety meds, and they regularly saw a psychologist. It helped, but the meds did come with a few side effects that also likely affected their health in a negative way.
Regular exercise helped them for a while, too. But after breaking their hip, daily walks turned into limited movement from the confines of a wheelchair. And of course, the anxiety remained.
My grandmother died in 2007. And while I know they always made the best of a bad situation, it pained me that I was unable to help them overcome the stress that I believe took a few important years off their life — years that, had they been around, would've been filled with the weddings of two of their grandkids and the birth of five new great-grandchildren.
Legalize it!
I've always been fascinated by how certain "unconventional" therapies have helped many people reduce stress. From yoga and meditation to changes in diet, there are plenty of folks who have been able to conquer their stress and anxiety demons without pills.
Not that I have anything against taking anti-anxiety pills. The way I see it, if something works for you, you should go for it.
Which is why I'm such a huge advocate of marijuana legalization.
Let me explain...
At the height of my grandmother's fits of anxiety, I considered bringing them some pot cookies. I even talked to them about it. They considered it for a moment, but then decided they didn't want to risk getting caught.
It was that day that I realized how incredibly unethical marijuana prohibition was.

Ethical Investing
I truly believe that had my grandmother not feared for their safety, they would've had a viable alternative to the meds they didn't really like so much — or at least a supplement that could've helped take the edge off.
There are plenty of studies out there that have shown a correlation between marijuana consumption and health benefits for seniors. It can relieve arthritis pain and inflammation, it can reduce stress and anxiety, and it can help increase appetite.
There's also a fair amount of new evidence that suggests marijuana can slow the spread of Alzheimer's, limit neurological damage after a stroke, and help lower insulin levels in diabetics.
The bottom line is that it's simply unethical to support the prohibition of marijuana while so many of our senior citizens could benefit from it. And that's why, as an ethical investor, I invest in marijuana and marijuana-related companies.
Truth is, the stigma attached to marijuana is disappearing at a rapid rate. And as you know, more and more individual states are taking it upon themselves to legalize, even in the face of opposition from the federal government. But sooner or later, the feds will relent, and those who have staked their claim early will reap the rewards of their marijuana investments.
Just consider the following:
81% of adults in the U.S. favor legalizing marijuana for medical use.
Half of all Americans are supportive of legalization for recreational use.
Support for the legalization of marijuana — both for medical treatment and recreational use — has increased by seven percentage points over the past four years.
26 states now have some form of medical marijuana policy in place.
69% of Republicans are in favor of legalizing marijuana for medical treatment.
87% of Democrats are in favor of legalizing marijuana for medical treatment.
Almost 90% of Independents favor the legalization of marijuana for medical treatment.
More than 75% of Americans believe tax revenues will increase following legalization.
Look, it's not a question of if prohibition will be lifted. It's a matter of when. And I'm betting it's going to happen before this decade comes to a close.
Invest accordingly.
To a new way of life and a new generation of wealth...

Lawyer Lorenzo “Larry” Gadon, the complainant in the impeachment case against Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, may be charged with perjury after Associate Justice Teresita De Castro denied giving information on the court documents that Gadon accused Sereno of falsifying.
“The implication [of De Castro's denial] is that Attorney Gadon may be liable for perjury. That's their declaration and this is under oath,” Rep. Reynaldo Umali, House justice committee chairperson, told reporters after the nine-hour impeachment hearing on Wednesday.

The committee held a hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to pursue the impeachment complaint against Sereno.
Gadon earlier revealed to the panel that their allegation of falsification of public documents in 2013 against Sereno came from De Castro, which was relayed to them by newspaper reporter Jomar Canlas.
But moments after Gadon said this, De Castro issued a statement denying that they had released to Canlas “any information, report, or document regarding the work of the Court.”
The committee said it would summon De Castro and Canlas to substantiate Gadon's allegation that Sereno tampered with a temporary restraining order De Castro recommended in 2013.
Umali said the committee would also want to hear the side of Canlas.
“Baka naman napayabang lang talaga siya,” Umali said. “Nag-kwento siya kay Attorney Gadon kaya nako-quote pangalan niya ngayon. We will look deep into these contradictory statements from De Castro, Gadon. And hopefully, Canlas can clarify this.”
Asked if De Castro's denial could weaken the impeachment case, Umali said: “That's one of the many allegations.”
Reacting to Umali's statement that they could be charged with perjury, Gadon said: “Hindi pwedeng matawag na perjurious yun because even if no [SC] justice would testify on those documents, nandun yung presence ng documents.”
“Merong memorandum eh. Meron siyang [De Castro] letter. Hindi lang naibigay sa akin dahil wala raw yung kopya dahil naibigay nila sa VACC [Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption],” they added.

Gadon also expressed confidence that they had proven all their allegations well enough before the committee.
“Maganda at saka lumabas na nagkaroon talaga ng due proces at I was grilled,” they said. “Sigurado ko na na-prove ko lahat.”
The House justice panel is slated to conduct its next hearing on Monday, Nov. 27, at 9:30 a.m. to deliberate on the other grounds of Gadon's impeachment complaint against Sereno. /atm

First in a series upcoming the Raiders and NFL free agency, which begins March 7:
For all the good things Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie has done in procuring talent over the past two seasons, identifying cornerbacks and safeties has been a problem area since they arrived in 2012.
Other than bringing in Charles Woodson, who had three good seasons to close out a Hall of Fame career, McKenzie has mostly swung and missed.
For three years, the Raiders looked to past-their-prime players to be starting cornerbacks, and they were predictably either injured or didn't have enough left in the tank _ Ron Bartell and Shawntae Spencer in 2012, Mike Jenkins and Tracy Porter in 2013 and Tarell Brown and Carlos Rogers in 2014.
The draft brought a decent value in returning player TJ Carrie (seventh round, 2014) as a well as a potential bust (DJ Hayden, first round, 2013) while the picks of Keith McGill (fourth round, 2014) and Dexter McDonald (seventh round, 2015) remain an open question.
McKenzie and coach Jack Del Rio will give it another shot in 2016. The Raiders will need at least two new starters and possibly three. Waiver claim David Amerson, assuming they don't revert to their 2014 form with Washington, should start, and Carrie could factor at either the other cornerback spot or safety.
Ideally, they Raiders will sign both a safety and a corner in free agency and then add each position in the draft as well.
The Raiders have an estimated cap space of more than $74 million, meaning they can afford anyone they want. Still, even with that much room to operate, McKenzie isn't likely to go much over their own idea of a player's worth. That's the way they roll.
A look at some free agent possibilities when free agency begins March 9, as well as returning players and their own free agents:
UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS
Cornerbacks
Sean Smith, Kansas City: The Chiefs franchised safety Eric Berry, which could leave Smith on the market for a big-money deal. Smith is in their prime at 28, has the size the Raiders love (6-3, 218) and Del Rio is fond of raiding division rivals (see Rodney Hudson last year).
Janoris Jenkins, Los Angeles: Jenkins (5-10, 198) was a candidate to franchised but lost out to fellow corner Trumaine Johnson. They have a knack for scoring touchdowns _ five in their career. One negative _ according to Profootballfocus.com, Jenkins has five touchdown passes in each of the last three seasons.
Casey Hayward, Green Bay: Hayward had three pretty solid seasons for the Packers, and has experience both in the slot and outside. McKenzie will always give a close look to former Packers. They will turn 27 in September.
Prince Amukamara, N.Y. Giants: Someone will sign the former first-round pick out of Nebraska. But Amukamara has missed way too much action because of injuries, playing a full 16-game schedule only once in 2013.
Safeties
Eric Weddle, San Diego: A hard-nosed player the Raiders have admired from the other side of the line of scrimmage, Weddle is 31 years old and may have too much wear and tear for McKenzie's liking. But as Woodson showed, smart players can compensate with know-how at safety in a way they can't at cornerback.
Reggie Nelson, Cincinnati: The best pure centerfielder in the free agent market, Nelson had a career-high eight interceptions for 115 yards in returns. One potential problem _ Nelson was a first-round pick with Jacksonville when Del Rio was coach, got themselves in the doghouse after a strong rookie season and wound up being dealt for a conditional draft pick. The other issue? He's 32 years old.
Rodney McLeod, Los Angeles: Has started 48 games for the Rams over the past three seasons and is only 25 years old. Has only five career interceptions but has the reputation of being a hard hitter with seven forced fumbles. Profootballfocus.com graded McLeod out higher than either Jenkins or Norris, the Rams starting corners.
George Iloka, Cincinnati: Classic strong safety size at 6-4, 225 but has also played in the deep middle even with Nelson around. Has shown the ability to defend against the league's toughest tight ends. Iloka was limited to 12 games because of injury.
Walter Thurmond, Philadelphia: Has the Ken Norton factor going for him, having signed a one-year deal in Philadelphia after playing for Seattle from 2010 through 2013. Thurmond made the transition from corner to free safety last year, and the Raiders love that kind of versatility. Lots of problems with injuries until they played 16 games last season.
Tashaun Gipson, Cleveland: Coming off a poor season on a bad Browns defense, but Gipson had a high coverage grade in 2014 for Profootballfocus.com as well as six interceptions. Could be had at a nice price, and McKenzie loves the idea of a bargain.
PLAYERS UNDER CONTRACT
CB David Amerson: Hard to imagine where Raiders would have been without him. Waiver claim of the year.
CB-S TJ Carrie: Remains to be seen where the Raiders believe they will settle in. Has played 28 of 32 games, but there is concern over how often they are less than 100 percent physically.
CB DJ Hayden: Time is running out. Odds are he'll never look like the 12th pick in the draft, but becoming a serviceable player is not out of the question.
CB Keith McGill: Injuries have limited their practice time and development. The Raiders like their classic corner build (6-3, 210) but hasn't been able to break through at a position in need of fresh talent.
CB Dexter McDonald: Played in only six games as a rookie. Will be watched closely to see if he's a viable NFL player in Year 2.
CB SaQwan Edwards: A late-season roster addition after Nate Allen went on injured reserve, Edwards didn't make it out of training camp a year ago.
S Nate Allen: A big-ticket free agent a year ago, Allen spent much of the season on injured reserve/designated for return and didn't play well when they came back. Renegotiated their contract to remain at a lower price.
S Dewey McDonald: An addition to practice squad who was promoted to 53-man roster when Marcel Reece was suspended.
UNRESTRICTED FREE AGENTS
S Taylor Mays: A physical specimen who was once a second-round pick by the 49ers, Mays played in 14 games with five starts and had a career high five passes defensed.
S Larry Asante: Played in 16 games with two starts, plus played on special teams. Could be kept around for depth. Always in top condition.
RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS
CB Neiko Thorpe: Has shown enough to play in 28 games over the past two years on special teams and occasionally at cornerback (two starts in 2015) but unlikely to be counted on as a regular rotational player.
EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS FREE AGENTS
S Tevin McDonald: The son of former 49ers safety Tim McDonald bounced between the practice squad and the 53-man roster last season.
Beijing: A few days after China blocked a ban on dreaded terrorist and Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar in the United Nations, India has hit back by reportedly allowing World Uyghur Congress (WUC) leader Dolkun Isa to visit the country.
New Delhi's decision to permit Isa and their associates, whom China regards as backers of terrorism in its volatile Muslim-dominated Xinjiang province, has not gone down well with Beijing. Isa will attend a conference from April 28 to May 1 at Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile, in Himachal Pradesh.
China does not recognise the Tibetan government-in-exile and has been very critical of India's stand on Dalai Lama.
China on Thursday aired its concern over Isa's reported visit to India, saying they are a "terrorist" on Interpol's Red Corner and it is the obligation of all countries to bring them to justice.
"I am not aware of the situation, " Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, when asked about the reports that WUC, leaders including Isa, were given permission to meet the Dalai Lama later in April.
"What I want to point out is that Dolkun is a terrorist in red notice of the Interpol and Chinese police. Bringing them to justice is due obligation of relevant countries," Hua said.
Xinjiang, which has over 10 million Uyghur population of Turkik origin Muslims, was on the boil for several years over Uyghur protests against the large-scale settlements of Hans from different part of the country.
China blames East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a militant Islamist group, for terrorist attacks in Xinjiang and other parts of the country.

(This should not be relied upon for practical halacha. When a question arises a Rabbi should be consulted.)
1. The Gemara (Nidah 17a) emphasizes the importance of discarding one's nail clippings properly. The reason that the Gemara gives is that a pregnant woman who steps on a nail clipping is in danger of a miscarriage. Accordingly, the Gemara adds that, “One who burns their nails is a chassid, one who buries them is a tzadik, and one who throws them on the floor in a public place is a rasha.” This teaching is codified by many later day authorities including the Mishnah Berurah (260:6).
2. It is therefore imperative that one throws the nails down the toilet or in the garbage. Many great tzaddikim, including the Chazon Ish, were particular to burn their nails. (See Sefer Taameh Dikra, Chut Shani vol. 1 page 62 and Bitzeil Hachachma 2:35)
3. The Beer Heitiv (260:2) cites an interesting explanation as to why stepping on nails can be harmful to pregnant women. They explain that when Adam and Chava before they sinned were covered in a hard nail like membrane. After Chava caused Adam to sin the nail rescinded and now only covers the ends of our toes and fingers. Since Chava caused the nails to become removed from the body, the nails are forever dangerous to pregnant women.
אך א”כ משמע דלאו דוקא לאשה מעוברת אלא הה”ד לכל אשה, וכעין זה מצאתי בלקוטי מהרי”ח ח”ב דף ה' ע”ב והשאיר בצ”ע. וע”ע בנימוקי יוסף מועד קטן י”ח. שמפלת “משום מיאוס, וי”א משום כשפים”.
4. The Prisha (241) writes that there should be no difference between toenails and fingernails, both may not be placed in an area where a pregnant woman may step on it.34 A similar ruling can be found in the Ben Ish Chai (Year 2 Lech Lecha 14). [Interestingly, the Sefer Otzar Yad Hachaim (1146), however, notes that they found in an Italian Yom Kippur Machzor that one of the things that one asks for atonement is for “throwing one's fingernails (in an open area).” This implies that the law only applies to fingernails and not toenails.] One should rule stringently in accordance with the view of the Prisha and Ben Ish Chai.
כן נראה פשוט ובפרט דהוי חשש סכנה, ומה עוד דאינו מוכח מהמחזור שאין קפידא בשל צפרני רגליו, דאולי נקט צפרני היד משום שזה מצוי ביותר שיזרוק הצפורן יותר משל צפרני רגליו ע”ש.
5. The Sefer Sheilas Rav (Chapter 12:8) states that Harav Chaim Kanievsky shlit”a maintains that a woman should not walk on their own nails or on the nails of a non-Jew. [It must be noted that Harav Chaim Kanievsky shlit”a professed that their opinions stated in the Sefer Sheilas Rav should not be relied upon for normative halacha.] However, Harav Yitzchak Zilberstein shlit”a cites Harav Chaim Kanievsky shlit”a as ruling that a pregnant woman may walk on the nails of a non-Jew (Melachim Omnayich page 341). For normative halacha, a rav should be consulted.
6. The Gemara (Moed Katan 18a) states that throwing nails in a place where women do not frequent is permitted, since there is no concern that a pregnant woman will step on the nails. It is therefore permissible to throw one's nails in a bais medrash or in a men's mikvah (if these areas are not frequented by women).
7. The Gemara says that if the nails fell to the floor and are then swept to a different area they no longer pose any danger to women.
8. The Prisha, based upon the previous halacha, writes that if one dropped a nail they should sweep the area thereby moving the nail and nullifying it's dangerous properties. The Mishnah Berurah cites the Elyah Rabba who feels that the danger is only removed if the nails are moved to an entirely different room. If, however, they are moved within the room they still are dangerous. The Chida (Birkei Yosef 260:6) rules in accordance with the Prisha. Accordingly, if a pregnant woman enters an area where manicures are taking place the area should be swept in front of them
ועיין בפרי חדש יו”ד ס' קט”ז, הובא במחצית השקל ס' ר”ס ס”ק א', דמ”מ מסתברא דה”מ דכניש מדוכתא קמא דנפלי ביה ממילא, אבל אי לקח למקום אחד ומיד היה דעתו להזיז אותם למקום השני, אותו המקום השני יש סגולת מקום הראשון ומזיק. וע”ע בספר שמירת הגוף והנפש סימן ס”ח שהביא עוד דברים בענין נטילת צפרנים ע”ש ואכמ”ל.

Herapathite, or iodoquinine sulfate, is a chemical compound whose crystals are dichroic and thus can be used for polarizing light. The composition of herapathite has been shown by the Danish chemist Sophus Mads Jørgensen in 1877 and others to be 4QH 2 ·3SO 4 ·2I 3 ·6H 2 O, where Q denotes the quinine molecule C 20 H 24 N 2 O 2 . The crystal can give up at least some of its water without losing its form and optical properties.[1]
According to Edwin H. Land, it was discovered in 1852[2] by William Bird Herapath, a Bristol surgeon and chemist. One of their pupils found that adding iodine to the urine of a dog that had been fed quinine produced unusual green crystals. Herapath noticed while studying the crystals under a microscope that they appeared to polarize light.[3]
In the 1930s, Prof. Ferdinand Bernauer invented a process to grow single herapathite crystals large enough to be sandwiched between two sheets of glass to create a polarizing filter; these were sold under the Bernotar name by Carl Zeiss. Herapathite can be formed by precipitation by dissolving quinine sulphate in acetic acid and adding iodine tincture.[4]
Herapathite's dichroic properties came to the attention of Sir David Brewster, and were later used by Land in 1929 to construct the first type of Polaroid sheet polarizer. They did this by embedding herapathite crystals in a polymer instead of growing a single large crystal.

To conduct research on space weather, an enterprising group of UCLA undergraduates is manufacturing the first satellite built entirely on the UCLA campus.
The Electron Loss and Fields Investigation CubeSat, or ELFIN, is a tiny satellite the size of a loaf of bread that still packs the scientific punch of significantly larger, more expensive satellites. When launched, ELFIN will determine how solar wind particles and radiation behave in Earth's environment, a topic of increasing concern because magnetic storms can wreak havoc on space infrastructure like GPS, communication and weather satellites, and even damage the electrical grid here on Earth.
“With the advent of space tourism and the increased reliance on satellites, understanding space weather is becoming increasingly important to our society,” said Vassilis Angelopoulos, a professor in the UCLA Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences and ELFIN principal investigator. “We need to study the electron loss process to assemble the full picture of how space radiation is driven by solar particles.”
From the beginning, ELFIN had only scant internal funding, and the outlook for completion was unclear.
In spite of this uncertainty, a team of several dozen intrepid undergraduate students took on the project as their own, collectively putting in thousands of hours as a labor of love, developing and testing the satellite's subsystems with the hope that the project would someday be fully funded.
.
After three years of diligent work and patience, the tide finally turned in 2013 when the U.S. Air Force awarded the team a $110,000 grant to continue development and buy much-needed parts. Last February, the opportunity to achieve their goal became even more real for these space Bruins when NASA's CubeSat Initiative and the Low-Cost Access to Space program guaranteed them a launch spot.
Finally on May 23, the team was awarded $1.2 million jointly from NASA and the National Science Foundation, ensuring enough funding to put the space-qualified hardware in orbit and to operate it for six months from the UCLA Mission Operations Center, to be located on campus.
A collaboration between the Aerospace Corporation and UCLA's departments of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences; Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE); and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, ELFIN will not only benefit UCLA students, who will have the opportunity to work on a real-world space program, but will also resolve a critical space physics question.
“ELFIN will train tomorrow's leaders in space science and engineering,” said Richard Wirz, a professor in the UCLA Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and a mission co-investigator. “This educational experience enables students to apply what they learn in the classroom in a hands-on, team setting and do whatever it takes to reach a scientifically compelling and challenging goal.”
Drew Turner, an associate researcher in Earth, planetary and space sciences, noted that a quick-turnaround mission like this will give students the rare opportunity to see a project from conception to completion.
“The ELFIN experience is unusual in comparison to an industry that typically deals with one-ton satellites that take up to 10 years to build by a veritable army of engineers,” Turner said. “This will be an invaluable, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our students — a ride to space they will never forget!”
The satellite is tentatively scheduled for launch in late 2016 or early 2017 as a secondary payload (similar to carpooling), which greatly reduces the cost of reaching space. From its polar orbit approximately 370 miles overhead, ELFIN will determine how high-energy electrons in Earth's radiation belt (located roughly 25,000 miles above the equator) are scattered out of their cyclical orbits by naturally occurring ultra-low-frequency electromagnetic waves.
ELFIN Once in orbit, ELFIN will study the phenomena that cause the dazzling auroras.
These electrons are guided along Earth's magnetic field (which resembles a bar magnet) and fall into the atmosphere above the north and south poles, where their energy is transformed into the dazzling lights of the auroras. By analyzing the speed and direction of the falling electrons, the team will be able to tell what types of waves scattered them from the heart of the radiation belts. A sensitive on-board magnetometer will also look for the signature of these waves to confirm the scattering theory.
Understanding this “emptying” of the radiation belts will help scientists predict the effects of future space weather storms.
“This was impossible to do before, because no previous mission had the angle and energy resolution that ELFIN has,” Angelopoulos said. “Our students will be able to contribute to space research in a very unique and meaningful way.”
While UCLA has a 40-year legacy of building space instruments for NASA and other international missions, and a strong presence in space science research, ELFIN represents UCLA's debut in end-to-end mission development and operations. The spacecraft will be tracked by a dedicated ground station on top of Knudsen Hall, with a backup station on the roof of Boelter Hall. The collaboration with the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, Calif., enhances UCLA's space science capabilities, while in turn providing an industrial partner with a highly trained workforce to tap into the future.
Although the grant was awarded right before summer break, the prototype lab and workroom are both bustling with students cutting metal, testing circuits and working on various design aspects of the project.
“It's mind-blowing to be making parts that will end up in space,” said Alexander Phinney, who is studying mechanical and aerospace engineering and working as a machinist on the project. “It's really cool, but also [there's] a huge pressure to do things right as there are no second chances in space.”
In early August, ELFIN's engineering design review will be held at the Small Satellite Conference in Utah.
“We are fortunate to be at UCLA in an environment with extremely competent staff, researchers and faculty who care and take the time to work one-on-one with us,” said Chris Shaffer, a senior in MAE and ELFIN's student project manager. “We are building a team of students and staff with the mentality that there is nothing that we can't do. That teamwork will be the hallmark of our project's success. A banner stating that ‘Failure is not an option' has been hanging in our lab ever since we started.”

The 18-year-old Georgia native is making a big splash with Huddersfield Town's first team. ASN's Brian Sciaretta spoke to Holmes about their development, and their dream of playing for the U.S.

Huddersfield Town FC is long and complicated. Founded in 1908, the West Yorkshire team rose to prominence in the 1920s and established itself as one of England's best clubs. It won the FA Cup in 1922 and accumulated three straight league titles from 1924 to 1926.
In the years following World War II, Huddersfield's stature as a top English club declined and it has not been in the top flight since 1972. Drifting between the lower divisions, the club reached a low point shortly after the millennium when it entered into administration and was mired in the fourth tier of the English pyramid.
Huddersfield came out of administration in 2003 and since then the club's prospects have gradually improved. It now sits mid-table of the second division Championship and there is now optimism among the supporters of the Terriers, as the club is commonly referred.
American midfielder Duane Holmes, 18, has witnessed the club's ascendancy first hand as they first donned a Huddersfield jersey 10 years ago to play for the Terrier's U-9 team. Over the years Holmes progressed through every level of Huddersfield's academy, and this year they have finally broken through with the first team.
Many teenagers have managed to find minutes in the Championship but Holmes has done so in stunning fashion. They made their debut against Hull City in a Capitol One Cup game on September 24 of this year. While Huddersfield lost 1-0, Holmes was praised in the media, and the Press Association match report proclaimed: “Huddersfield's best player on the night was 18-year-old substitute Duane Holmes, who terrified Hull with their direct running.”
Days later, Holmes made their Championship debut for Huddersfield after coming on as a second half substitute against Blackpool. With the Terriers trailing 1-0, Holmes was dominant in a Man of the Match performance as they brilliantly assisted on the equalizer and set up a penalty which their teammate James Vaughan failed to convert.
Over the weekend, Holmes came on in the second half for Huddersfield in a 2-1 loss to Watford. Despite the defeat, Terriers head coach Mark Robins was quick to praise Holmes, saying they “was positive again, and that has to rub off on everybody.”
“It's been surreal the past month,” Holmes told American Soccer Now. “I'm trying not to change too much. I'm keeping my feet on the ground and working hard as I can to stay in the manager's plans. I wasn't so much nervous but the academy manager came over to me and told it was just like any other game. I'm playing against better players but I have better players beside me. It was unbelievable. It's what you dream about from when you are a little kid.”
Holmes' sudden impact with Huddersfield's first team has been a long time coming and is not surprising to the club's supporters. Last year they were the leading scorer for Huddersfield's U-18 team. Their standout performances earned them a nomination as the Football League's Apprentice of the Year (he was runner-up). After the season Holmes was awarded their first professional contract by Huddersfield, and at the start of the season they scored three goals in five games for the U-21 team before their promotion to the first team.
Holmes' strong pedigree, combined with their recent success in the Championship, have led to a great deal of media attention. Head coach Mark Robins, however, is doing their best to calm the hype and instead gradually ease Holmes into the first team.
“It was good to see them have such an impact,” Mark Robins told the media after the Blackpool draw. “We have a number of players showing promise in our academy and Under-21 squads, and if they are good enough, we have to give them a chance. But we also have a responsibility to nurture them and manage their development carefully, and we will continue to bring Duane, and others, on at the right pace.”
After a series of strong performances, Holmes has the urge to play as much as possible but they realize that Robins and the Huddersfield staff have a vision that is in the long-term interests of the club's younger players.
“I want to play as much as I can but obviously the manager knows what's best for me as a young professional,” Holmes said. “Obviously it seems to be working with the amount of good young players we have coming through at the U-21s. They know what he's doing. When we're called upon, we're going to do everything to can.”
While Holmes has progressed through every level of the Huddersfield academy, it hasn't always been a smooth ride to the top. Standing at just five-foot-six, Holmes has always dealt with issues regarding their size and strength. To this day they realize that they must continue to get stronger to deal with adult defenders in the English game.
Two years ago, however, their future was a crossroads. A high-ranking member of Huddersfield's academy at the time (who is no longer with the club) informed Holmes that they did not think the midfielder had a future in the game. It was a dark moment for the player.
“It was someone high in the academy who told me I wasn't going to be a footballer,” Holmes recalled. “He said: ‘I'm not big enough, I'm not strong enough, and I'm not good enough.' But things change and people change. I've seen them a couple of times since I got my first professional contract and it just makes me happy I didn't quit. It gives me satisfaction I've done it and proved them wrong.”
“I was 16 at the time,” they continued. “I was going through a bad time. To be told that, it put me down. But I also had two coaches who were telling me to carry on and were pushing me. They were telling me I could make it. That's really what kept me going. They were two coaches who had been with me for a long time and have seen the best and worst in me.”
As Holmes continued to push forward, Huddersfield hired former player Mark Lillis to run the team's academy in December 2011. It proved to be a very important boost to their development.
Lillis was on hand for Holmes' debut with the first team and insists that the young players are ready for the challenges that lie ahead.
“The manager (Mark Robins) thinks a lot of them and so do I,” Lillis recently told the Huddersfield Examiner. “I don't think they would have any problem starting with them but we have to go steady and keep their feet on the ground. But when you come on and make an impact and create a goal—like they did against Blackpool on Friday—you put a seed in the manager's head. You can't wait until they reach 21. Players can be ready at 17 or 18. If you're good enough, you're old enough.”
“Duane's got all the attributes,” they continued. “He has the skill and pace, great balance, knows a pass, and has an eye for goal. They will need to be stronger upper body-wise because they are not the biggest. But we can work on that. When I joined the academy 18 months ago I spotted them straight away. People were saying they were not big enough and this and that, but if you are good enough you have a chance."
"I told Duane to embrace the challenge. I said be yourself, don't be fazed and don't be sad on the bus afterwards with any regrets. They made an impact at Hull, and against Blackpool they lifted the fans and the team, to be truthful. All credit to the gaffer for giving young players a chance."
Holmes' sudden rise within Huddersfield has also earned them fans in the United States. They were born in Columbus, Georgia, to an American father and an English mother. Growing up, they even spent time in Alaska before moving back to England with their mother at the age of four after their parents separated.
They have always considered themselves American, and growing up they frequently visited their family in the U.S. Holmes has even taken an interest in following Major League Soccer and appreciates how competitive the league has become. They have tentative plans to travel to Glasgow in November to watch the U.S. national team play Scotland. Despite also being eligible for England, it is their dream to play internationally for the United States and they enjoy conversing on Twitter with their growing number of American followers.
“It's weird because I didn't realize how big it was over there,” Holmes said. “People have been tweeting me and tagging Klinsmann and the U.S. team. It's good because that's what I want. I want people in America to know who I am, and that I do want to play for the United States and represent where I'm from.”

The Silent Majority of Experts
When I still followed the Usenet group comp.lang.forth, I wasn't the only person frustrated by the lack of people doing interesting things with the language. Elizabeth Rather, co-founder of Forth, Inc., offered the following explanation: there are people solving real problems with Forth, but they don't hang out in the newsgroup. They would know; their company exists to support the construction of commercial Forth projects.
In 1996 I worked on a port of The Need for Speed to the SEGA Saturn. (If you think that's an odd system to be involved with, I also did 3DO development, went to a Jaguar conference at Atari headquarters, and had an official set of Virtual Boy documentation.) There were a number of game developers with public faces in the 1990s, but the key people responsible for the original version of The Need for Speed, released in 1994, remained unknown and behind the scenes. That's even though they had written a game based around rigid-body physics before most developers had any idea that term was relevant to 3D video games. And they did it without an FPU: the whole engine used fixed-point math.
Yes, there are many people who blog and otherwise publicly discuss development methodologies and what they're working on, but there are even more people who don't. Blogging takes time, for example, and not everyone enjoys it. Other people are working on commercial products and can't divulge the inner workings of their code.
That we're unable to learn from the silent majority of experts casts an unusual light upon online discussions. Just because looking down your nose at C++ or Perl is the popular opinion doesn't mean that those languages aren't being used by very smart folks to build amazing, finely crafted software. An appealing theory that gets frantically upvoted may have well-understood but non-obvious drawbacks. All we're seeing is an intersection of the people working on interesting things and who like to write about it--and that's not the whole story.
Your time may better spent getting in there and trying things rather than reading about what other people think.

Davis Cup final - Belgium v Great Britain Venue: Flanders Expo, Ghent Dates: 27-29 November BBC coverage: Watch on BBC television, BBC Sport website, Connected TVs, tablets, mobiles and app. Listen on Radio 5 live and 5 live sports extra. Full details.
We arrived in Ghent on Monday before the Davis Cup final and so far everything has been great, if a bit cold! The court is good, the town is nice and, most importantly, I won at snooker.
Thanks for all the good wishes you've been sending. I thought I'd use this column to answer a few of your questions.
Q) When you are all not talking about tennis (or football) what does team GB discuss at the dinner table? (@AndiMillman)
We're discussing my snooker victory over Ken Skupski on Tuesday night - we talked about that quite a lot. It wasn't comprehensive at all - I had to pot the brown, blue, pink and black in a row to get the win. It was a decent break. I've probably done better than that, my best is around mid-20s, but Tuesday's would have been up there. I think it was the highest break of the night to win. It was a bit lucky, to be fair.
Q) Who's the biggest prankster in the changing room and what's the best prank you've seen? (@MoWilson18)
We don't really play pranks, it's really just everyone constantly dishing out stick to each other. Shane Annun, our physio, takes a lot of it actually.
Q) Would winning the Davis Cup with Team GB mean more to you than winning a Grand Slam? (Linda Farnhill)
I think it would be different. The enjoyment you get out of winning as part of a team I would say is greater than on your own. When we win Davis Cup matches it's nicer celebrating with everyone and having a big team around. It would be comparable but completely different to a Slam.

A Slam also happens in the space of a couple of weeks, whereas the Davis Cup - this year has been over the course of nine or 10 months but it has actually been a much longer road, like five or six years.
Q) Given the tour is so worldwide, is there a difficult aspect to playing away from home? (Aidan Williams)
It makes a difference but playing in front of a home crowd can help or also hinder in an individual sport. Some players don't enjoy it - they can lift you when you're down but you can also put a lot of pressure on yourself to perform. When you play away from home, the crowd is against you but it does feel like there's a little bit less pressure. The expectation tends to be with the home team.

Q) Do you like having a coach/captain on the court during games and would you like to see that introduced on tour? (Greg Edwards)
I guess it's nice - it's different. I don't see it as being a negative in any way. The thing with the on-court coaching on the rest of the tour is I don't think it really works.
Some players are at a huge disadvantage depending on the language they speak, because if you speak a language that the commentators and others don't understand then the whole tour and locker room don't know what the coach is telling you at the side. If you speak English or Spanish then everyone does, and I don't think that's so fair.
Q) Would you ever consider being Great Britain's Davis Cup captain in the future? (William Smith)
I've never really thought about it, to be honest. I don't think it would happen immediately after I stop playing because I would want to do other stuff first, but maybe when I'm quite a bit older.
It's obviously completely different to what I do now. Obviously I would have the experience of playing in the matches, so would have a good understanding of how the players are feeling and what they're going through. But you have to be able to communicate well with different people; you have to be able to manage a team, which I think is what Leon Smith has done extremely well. They don't have the experience of having played in the matches but their management of the team has been excellent I think.
So there are different ways of doing the job, and whether I'd be good at it, I don't know.
Q) Will you play the Davis Cup again next year? Please do! (Nicola Jade)
The plan is to play the first tie against Japan in March, and then it will be difficult. If we win, the tie after Wimbledon but before the Olympics is not easy timing. Both the Davis Cup and the Olympics events are important, both are for your country, but it's better to prepare properly for one rather than a little bit for both.
I would rather prepare as best I can for one and give it my best shot. I'll definitely be playing the tie against Japan, that's for sure, and then after that we'll have to see what happens with my schedule.
The Lander-based Wyoming Catholic College is welcoming its largest class this coming term, according to a news release.
“We are delighted to welcome our largest class ever,” college President Dr. Glenn Arbery said in the news release Tuesday.
Fifty-nine freshmen from 26 states will increase the college's total enrollment to at least 175 students, which marks a 60 percent increase over the past four years.
“These students from across the country show the national appeal of WCC," Arbery said.
"It's especially encouraging that with this dramatic growth, we have been able to maintain the caliber of students entering," they said. "From test scores, to high school GPA, to personal integrity, these are some of the brightest young Catholic minds.”
Freshmen arrived Monday to participate in informational meetings and introductory activities.
For the rest of the week, they will take a wilderness first-aid course to prepare for the unusual orientation program of a three-week backpacking trip across the Wind River Mountains.
Dr. Thomas Zimmer, assistant professor of leadership and outdoor education said the backpacking trip is more than about fun.
"It's the beginning of the transformative formation they will receive here at Wyoming Catholic College," Zimmer said.
"Over these three weeks, our students will grow in confidence and leadership skills, being called upon to make real-life decisions with real-life consequences," they said. "And they will grow in wonder as they experience God in Their marvelous and beautiful Creation.”
PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – A child was mauled to death at the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium Sunday morning after falling into an enclosure.
The investigation into the toddler's death continued Monday and witnesses describe it as a terrifying and chaotic scene.
The parking lot was empty Monday morning as the zoo is now closed until further notice. The incident was described as “beyond traumatic” for all that witnessed a 2-year-old boy fall into the yard where 11 African painted dogs mauled the toddler to death.
“From what I understand, what occurred at that scene until it was secured, it was horrific,” Lt. Kevin Kraus said.
“Our hearts, and prayers, and sorrows go out to the family of the young child,” Dr. Barbara Baker of the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium said.
Dr. Baker said staff, despite their best efforts, could not stop the attack.
Describing the wild animals as being territorial, all but one was eventually secured. The last dog showed extreme aggressiveness towards emergency crews and the lifeless body of the boy.
“Very unfortunately in this situation, the dogs were doing what they normally would do,” Dr. Baker said. “He would not move away from the child when the emergency teams arrived, so they were shot. And that was the correct thing to do. While we care very much for the animals, human safety, human life is more important.”
Police said the mother and toddler, from Pleasant Hills, were on the observation deck of the exhibit just before noon, when the mother placed the child on the railing.
They lost their balance and fell over 11 feet into the enclosure. The attack lasted only minutes and was witnessed by the mother, family and others nearby.
“A couple of the men around that area were running up to the dog pen and banging on the wood trying to get the dogs to kind of leave the kid alone, telling the kid to run,” one witness said.
Police said it would be highly inappropriate to speculate about any charges, but they will be looking into the safety of the exhibit and any precautions that could have been taken.
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl issued a statement about the tragedy Monday morning:
“As a father myself, I can imagine the pain that the parents and family are going through, and it must be unbearable. This tragic incident has shocked and devastated the entire community. We must focus now on sending our prayers and support to the victim's family and to all involved with this tragic incident as officials continue their investigation.”
The zoo will be holding a press conference at 1 p.m. to further discuss this incident.

Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent in the Supreme Court case that declared the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional is, as expected, fun reading. It's also quite representative of the current state of anti-gay marriage arguments in general: It is much more concerned with whining and raging than it is with actual argumentation.
Scalia's main point is that the court has no right to strike down DOMA. In doing so, Scalia says, the Supreme Court has overstepped its authority.
Advertisement:
It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over the people's Representatives in Congress and the Executive. It envisions a Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions, always and everywhere “primary” in its role.
The case could be made that this is sort of the only honest Originalist argument -- there is nothing in the Constitution granting the Supreme Court the authority to determine the constitutionality of duly passed legislation, after all -- but obviously this argument rather glaringly contradicts every single instance of Scalia voting to strike down a law. Indeed, it contradicts a decision the Supreme Court announced yesterday, in which the conservatives decided that a portion of the Voting Rights Act that they didn't care for was unconstitutional because they didn't care for it. But if Scalia wishes to recuse themselves from all future cases involving constitutional questions, now that they have determined that Marbury v. Madison was improperly decided, I am not inclined to stop him.
Scalia is widely praised, even (perhaps especially) by liberals for their intelligence, their wit and their supposed intellectual consistency -- they are thought to have a very specific interpretation of the Constitution and while it's a dumb one they adhere to it -- but this decision exposes them for the politician that they actually are. As Richard Posner has argued, Scalia will abandon both strict textual originalism and "judicial restraint" when it suits him. (Justice Thomas is actually better at coming up with legal and constitutional justifications for their social conservatism, consistent with their view that the Constitution may only be understood in terms of the political and social context in which it was written.)
In most cases involving homosexuality, Scalia is likely to argue purely from disgust, and to resort to strange justifications for their disgust-based decisions.  They are repulsed by homosexuality and alarmed at America's acceptance of it. Therefore homosexuality is Not Constitutional, or something. Just reread their Lawrence v. Texas dissent, in which they invoke the feared "so-called homosexual agenda" and calls the court's majority decision "a massive disruption of the current social order." This dissent avoids most of that sort of talk, but the entire thing is still based on alarm and dismay at changing social mores.
That's because alarm and dismay are just about all that the social conservatives have left. The last legal argument gay marriage opponents have resorted to is a not particularly compelling claim that same-sex marriage might somehow be bad for children, because traditionally marriage was a tool used to force heterosexual couples to jointly raise their offspring. The "tradition" argument lacks any sort of legal justification: "We have always done it this way" is not really a good defense of an act's constitutionality. The other problem with the tradition argument, as Ross Douthat could tell you, is that there is very little about modern straight marriage that resembles "traditional marriage."
The most notable portion of Scalia's dissent isn't the point about the court's lack of jurisdiction, but the portion where they engage in straight-up right-wing victim-complex self-pity of the sort that would not be out of place in a Maggie Gallagher column. (Indeed, Maggie approvingly quotes this very passage.) Scalia moans at length that Justice Kennedy's decision is mean to anti-gay marriage people. It is so mean to them! People who oppose gay marriage are the Real Victims here, because Justice Kennedy has accused them of demeaning gay people simply by wishing to deny them the right to marry:
But to defend traditional marriage is not to condemn, demean, or humiliate those who would prefer other arrangements, any more than to defend the Constitution of the United States is to condemn, demean, or humiliate other constitutions. To hurl such accusations so casually demeans this institution. In the majority's judgment, any resistance to its holding is beyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its high-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute is to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to "disparage," "injure," "degrade," "demean," and "humiliate" our fellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homosexual. All that, simply for supporting an Act that did no more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been unquestioned in our society for most of its existence — indeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for virtually all of human history. It is one thing for a society to elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose change by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani generis, enemies of the human race.
The Defense of Marriage Act sounds so harmless when you put it that way! All it did was "codify an aspect of marriage that had been unquestioned in our society for most of its existence." The actual lives of gay people -- the specific rights and benefits denied them by DOMA and related legislation -- never enter into Scalia's thinking, at all. What matters most is the hurt feelings of social conservatives, who have been accused of malice against homosexuals. (I never knew Scalia cared so deeply about what their political opponents thought of him. They seemed like a thick-skinned fellow before this.)

This is the gay-marriage version of the "calling something racist is worse than racism" argument currently so popular among aggrieved white conservatives. (Justice Roberts basically made this argument in the court's horrible Shelby County v. Holder decision. Calling former Confederate states racist is racist against former Confederate states!) It is the lamest of last-resort arguments, and I'm not sure how same-sex marriage opponents expect same-sex marriage advocates to respond to it. Most people who support gay marriage -- which is now most Americans -- believe that gay marriage bans are discriminatory and unfair, and based more on fear and disgust than any sort of reason or logic. There seems to be plenty of evidence -- including evidence in Scalia's own history of opinions and statements -- that most opposition to gay marriage is rooted in irrational dislike of gay people, with half-assed appeals to "tradition" laid on top. When people point that out, they are accused of accusing their opponents of being monsters. But I'd love to hear how one is supposed to say "I think you're dead wrong on this moral question" without sounding too judgey.
It would've been much simpler, probably, for Scalia to have just said, like Kathryn Jena Lopez did today, they were "nostalgic" for the time when a Democratic president signed the Defense of Marriage Act. That's basically the argument he's making: Stuff is changing too much and I miss the days when everyone felt like discriminating against the gays was fine.
Attention, Filmmakers: Here's How to Talk Sound Design
So everyone is telling you to hire a sound designer on your next project, but what does a sound designer even do? At their best, a sound designer brings an audience into your world — immerses them in your story — in ways that are often taken for granted, and more often underutilized. Maybe the best way to understand the basics of what a sound designer does is to understand the vocabulary.
Here is a quick rundown of some basic terms that will help you communicate with a sound designer or — if you're doing it yourself — help you communicate basic sound design principles to your team.
READ MORE: Watch: Here's How the ‘Jurassic World' Team Created Realistic Dinosaur Sounds
Foley: Foley is any sound that needs to be recorded and performed to picture, for instance, someone walking or scribbling on paper or putting on a jacket. Rather than pulling files from a sound library, these sound effects work so much better when you can watch a screen and perform the sound over and over again until you get it exactly right. Foley work is very precise. If someone is putting on a jacket, you have to consider the type of material the jacket is made of, how much force they're using to put on the jacket, and with how much speed. The interesting thing about Foley effects is that you might not discern or focus on these types of sounds in real life. Your brain often filters them out as unimportant. But a good sound designer uses these effects to push and pull the audience's attention around the screen. If you want your audience to pay attention to that man in the crowd who's bending down to tie their shoes (what's they up to?), use Foley effects to help direct their attention.
Hard Effects: Hard effects are often pulled from sound libraries. These sounds can be more percussive, like an explosion, a punch, or a slamming car door. Of course, all of these sounds have to be recorded at some point, but they can be synced and modified over and over again for multiple purposes. There are tons of sound libraries out there (some of my favorites are Boom Library, Hiss and a Roar, The Recordist and Rabbit Ears Audio), or you can start building a library of your own.
People Walla: Exactly what it sounds like, people walla is the generic sound of people talking. It could be in a café or before a concert or at a festival; but when you isolate it, it sounds just like “wallawallawalla.” Well, almost like that. People walla varies by culture and language. If you're working on a project in another country, make sure to get walla from that specific area. It might not seem like a big deal; but trust me, those details matter — they're what surround your audience and bring them into your world.

It might not seem like a big deal; but trust me, those details matter — they're what surround your audience and bring them into your world. Cerebral Effects: These are the effects you'll use to bridge the gap between sound effects and music — and the possibilities are endless. While all sound design helps tell your story, cerebral effects do the most blatant work. They're emotional. When the big revelation happens at the end of Act Two, you might hear a cymbal scrape or roll. The audience might not be aware of the sound, but they're aware of the emotion it creates. Cerebral effects are a shift in thinking: from realism to hyperrealism. Your decisions are based more off of how you want your audience to feel. The sun shimmers on the ocean, and you hear it shimmer, which makes you feel the shimmer. In a dark environment, something trembles or rumbles. You feel the darkness.
Dallas Taylor is lead designer and creative director at Defacto Sound . Their sound work has spanned television (NBC, FOX, Discovery), games (“Fallout,” “The Elder Scrolls”) and film (“Blood Brother,” “A N O M A L Y”). They and their family live in Washington D.C.
READ MORE: The Keys to Music and Sound Design from the Sundance Lab Keep in mind: the relationship between sound effects and the cinematography is vital. Often the soundscapes are based on (and completes) the cinematographer's work. In the end, a sound designer's job is to expand the frame, to make off screen elements part of the narrative, to make the edges of the screen disappear. The techniques above are just some tools of the trade. But great sound design is about more than just filling in sounds where sounds go. It's about bringing an audience into your world and into your story. It's about making them feel something (literally and emotionally). Sound design isn't just a finishing touch; it's an essential — and often overlooked — element of effective filmmaking.

There is a larger number of terrorists who have fought for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and who now move around freely in the Swedish society. The authorities have no control of the situation, it was revealed in SVT's " Agenda " yesterday.Around 150 terrorists who fought for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, have returned to Sweden, The authorities in Sweden have no control of the terrorists or the situation. The government is, after almost three years of ISIS, still discussing new measures, and has as usual scrapped those that didn't work, including a "terrorist hotline" that concerned people could call.The only authority that possibly/hopefully keeps track of the terrorists, is the Security Police (Säpo), but they will not share their information with other authorities, meaning that local social workers have no clue that a genuine ISIS jihadist is knocking on the door, unless they find out for themselves.Officials who are working to pay out benefits to immigrants in the so-called vulnerable areas, namely report that they sometimes see their clients in videos from the Islamic State.- We can see in the media sometimes, pictures of our local residents, where they stand in the picture with a Kalashnikov and the ISIS flag, says social worker Betty Byvald, who works in the immigrant dense suburb of Angered in Gothenburg.She says in the reportage that terrorists who have fought for the Islamic State for a long time, now live as ordinary people in Sweden, like nothing ever happened.Säpo states that the terrorists who return to the West, now are prompted by the Islamic State not try to go back to the Middle East. Instead, they are ordered to carry out acts of terrorism against the West where they are. Which has already happened in several European cities recently.They should be deemed ticking bombs (literally) who constitute a major threat to the countries they live in. But not in Sweden, where they have a more liberal and relaxed approach to terrorism and terrorists of the worst kind, where the liberalism/naivety or worse, also apply when terrorists seek asylum:These terrorists of course, come in addition to the Swedish nationals who have fought for ISIS, and many may have slipped passed Säpo's increasingly panicking eyes.- Sweden is fairly unique because we are one of the countries that exported the heads of major terrorist attacks in Europe. There are no Danes, Norwegians or Germans in the worst terrorist attacks we have seen in Europe in recent years, linked to the Islamic State, says terrorism researcher Magnus Ranstorp.Social services throughout Sweden now urge Säpo to share the information, to let them know who the terrorists are, those who have come back to Sweden and are highly dangerous.The only thing is that Säpo are most likely losing control too. The number of terrorists coming back or discovered in the Swedish society, is simply getting too big - with much more radicalisation to come, for the understaffed and unprepared Säpo to try to avert:Comment below.

In March, TLC Chairman David Yassky said a fare hike wasn't on the agenda for this year, but what a difference a few months makes. After a fun hearing earlier this week the Taxi and Limousine Commission today voted to approve the first fare hike in six years. Starting sometime this fall, your average taxi ride is going to be 17 percent more expensive.
So what, exactly, is the damage going to be on your wallet? Well, the base fare for a ride will remain $2.50 but each click of the meter will soon increase from 40 to 50 cents. Meanwhile, the flat rate to JFK to and from Manhattan is going to jump from $45 to $52.
On the plus side of that hike? Six red cents from each trip will now go towards driver health care. Which is good for them, because according to the TLC the average cabbie now makes 24 percent less than they did in 2006, walking away with about $130 after a 12-hour shift (a number many cabbies say is a bit high).
The fare hike will most likely take effect in September. So, uh, get those cheaper cab rides while you still can?

The United States Army Chemical Museum has a very special gas mask. It looks like Mickey Mouse (©Disney)!! This mask was produced early in 1942 to protect children in case of a chemical attack on the United States. The
Mickey Mouse Mask By Major Robert D. Walk On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii with massive force that destroyed the battleships of the Pacific Fleet. In the dark days of early 1942, the US government was faced with the specter of defeat and gloom. Our military was fighting a losing battle on all fronts and fears of saboteurs and submarines attacking the US were high. A critical need existed to protect the civilian population, especially children, from gas attacks. Hawaii was of special concern and thousands of US military training masks were rushed in for the civilian population's use. No masks were available to protect children, so the Hawaiian Department used a locally fabricated expedient that consisted of a hood with bunny ears. On January 7th, 1942, one month after Pearl Harbor, T.W. Smith, Jr., the owner of the Sun Rubber Company, and their designer, Dietrich Rempel, with Walt Disney's approval introduced a protective mask for children. This design of the Mickey Mouse Gas Mask for children was presented to Major General William N. Porter, Chief of the Chemical Warfare Service. After approval of the CWS, Sun Rubber Products Company produced sample masks for review. Other comic book character designs were to follow, depending on the success of the Mickey Mouse mask. The mask was designed so children would carry it and wear it as part of a game. This would reduce the fear associated with wearing a gas mask and hopefully, improve their wear time and, hence, survivability. The protection of children was a primary concern of all nations during World War II. Germany had a child's gas protective crib for infants and a protective hood for toddlers and children unable to wear the adult noncombatant mask. The United Kingdom had a similar program. In the United States, the M1 Infant Protector was developed, using a standard civil defense filter with bellows to push air into a layered protective sack. The M1 series of Noncombatant Gas Masks was produced in large numbers for older children and adults. The Mickey Mouse Gas Mask was designed for small children in a valiant attempt to give them something that would work and still be fun. Ultimately, the Office of Civil Defense bought the M2 Noncombatant Gas Mask for small children to protect them from chemical agents. In tests, with proper coaching and good salespersonship by the leader, young children could be induced to wear the gas mask for extended periods. The Mickey Mouse Gas Mask was produced as part of the war production program. The Sun Rubber Company produced approximately 1,000 Mickey Mouse gas masks and earned an Army-Navy ‘E' for excellence in wartime production in 1944. Overall, production of the Noncombatant Gas Masks (and in fact, all gas masks) was one of the most successful production programs of the war. In fact, production had to be curtailed early due to the vast quantity produced. Thankfully, no chemical attacks occurred in the United States. Mickey Mouse Gas Masks were distributed to senior officials and others during the war as keepsakes. When the war ended, further desire for the mask vanished. It became an old idea whose time had passed. Very few of the Mickey Mouse gas masks survived. The US Army Chemical Museum at Fort McClellan, Alabama, has a hand-made prototype. The 45th Infantry Division Museum, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a production specimen on permanent display with other gas masks in the combat support area of the museum. The Walt Disney Archives, Burbank, California, has a facepiece without ears, lenses, or a canister, and a mask owned by the founder of the Sun Rubber Company was on display at the Summit County (Ohio) Historical Society's "Toys Made in Summit County" exhibit in 1982. Have you seen one of these masks? At the time this article was written, Major Robert D. Walk was the Weapons of Mass Destruction Individual and Instructor Training Officer at the US Army Reserve Command.  They are a graduate of the Command and General Staff College (Resident and Correspondence), the Combined Arms and Services Staff School, the Chemical Officers Advanced Course, and the Chemical Officers Basic Course. Previous assignments include Commander, 184th Chemical Detachment; Commander, HHC, 59th Ordnance Brigade; Acting Commander, 1st Battalion, 377th Regiment, 95th Division (Institutional Training); S-3, 1st Battalion, 377th Regiment, 95th Division (Institutional Training); S-3, 197th Ordnance Battalion; Chemical Officer, Readiness Group Stewart; and Chemical Officer, 60th Ordnance Group.
I had a panicky moment at the end of Act I when, at the party celebrating the engagement of Fraulein Schneider (Mary Gordon Murray) and Herr Schultz (Scott Robertson), Herr Ludwig (Patrick Vaill), wearing a swastika armband, begins to sing “Tomorrow Belongs to Me,” a horrifyingly catchy Nazi tune. They turn to us and asks everybody to join in, and, for terrible moment, I feared the audience would begin to sing with him. They didn't, of course, but it did speak meaning about today's political climate. And, I suppose, about the state of my psyche.
CABARET, the brilliant Kander and Ebb show, filled with some terrific songs (“Wilkommen,” “Maybe This Time”) is about the decadence of Weimar Germany and the rise of Nazism. A young American, Clifford Bradshaw (Benjamin Eakeley) arrives in Berlin to write a novel; they meet Sally Bowles (Leigh Ann Larkin), a showgirl at the Kit Kat Klub who becomes their roommate and their lover.
The proceedings are emceed by our guide through this sleazy world, Emcee (Jon Peterson). This is the role that Alan Cumming made famous, and reprised a few years ago in Roundabout Theatre's sensational production at Studio 54 under Sam Mendes' original direction. To say that Cumming is a hard act to follow is to state the obvious, and it takes a brave, and perhaps foolish man to follow that hard act. Jon Peterson is—maybe inevitably—disappointing.
The show is a blunt assault rather than an insidious argument; loudness is a problem throughout, as it often is with touring productions, as if everyone not in New York were somewhat deaf; the cast is miked to the max, obscuring lyrics and blasting the dialogue.
Whatever the distinction is between vulgar and decadent, it is a distinction blurred here: this debauched and degenerate Berlin looks more like a crude TV show, not a dangerous and somehow sophisticated ruin. But maybe the relevance factor is that it takes more to shock us these days: when everybody and his/her aunt/uncle is wearing green nail polish, we can't be expected to gasp at Sally's.

A Sydney fire station have shared footage from a GoPro camera which shows dozens of inconsiderate drivers ignoring an oncoming, siren-blaring, horn-tooting fire truck.
Filmed over a 24-hour period by Mount Druitt Fire Station, the video shows motorists brazenly disregarding NSW road rules - which state that drivers must get out of the way to ensure a clear passage through traffic for emergency vehicles if they have their siren and flashing lights on.
The video shows at least a dozen incidents where the crew in the 20-tonne fire truck have to brake suddenly or are impeded from being able to travel at a higher speed, due to motorists travelling slowly in front of them.
In one incident, a white hatchback fails to give way to the fire truck at a roundabout. To make matters worse, the Toyota Yaris then continues travelling in the same lane of traffic as the fire truck, rather than pulling over to the left to give way.
A blue Toyota driver is also seen attempting to turn right, rather than veering left until the firetruck has overtaken them.
Shockingly, in one incident, a P-plate orange Holden Commodore driver actually merges into the lane of the fire truck and takes roughly eight-seconds, and countless honks of the fire truck's horn, to revert back into their original lane.
"When we are coming to help you, seconds count. How motorists react makes a massive difference to how quickly we can get there," the fire station captioned the Facebook video. "This clip was filmed over one 24-hour shift only. This is not a highlight reel from weeks of footage!"

Efforts to curb a visa-waiver program in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attacks may win bipartisan support in Congress but already are stirring backlash from industries that thrive on foreign visitors.
Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Thursday that they plan to introduce a bill after the Thanksgiving recess that would tighten up parts of a decades-old program aimed at increasing the number of international tourists visiting the United States.
But industry groups argue that security backstops enacted in the 14 years since the Sept. 11 attacks are sufficient, and that overhauling the visa-waiver program would simply make it harder for law-abiding visitors to put the United States on their itineraries.
Though other reactions to the Paris attacks, including a House plan (HR 4038) to add new FBI certifications for potential Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers, have largely divided the parties, changes to the visa program appear to have broad backing. That means the business community has a tough job ahead.
“We understand on a political level why Congress wants to do something — especially when the knock on Congress is that they don't get much done,” said Jonathan Grella, the U.S. Travel Association's executive vice president for public affairs. “There are plenty of ideas that don't come at the cost of economic benefits.”
Grealla said their group is “pumping out” videos and fact sheets to make its case. Before lawmakers dashed out of town for the holiday, Grella said theme parks, hotel chains, cruise lines, casinos, rental car providers and other players they represent started reaching out to Capitol Hill and plan to continue the pressure campaign back home.
“We've found that a very effective method of communicating,” Grella said. “We hope lawmakers will listen.”
Pivot in Strategy
Before Paris, the travel and tourism industries had been on the offensive regarding the visa program. Bills (S 2091, HR 1401) introduced in both chambers already this year aimed to expand the visa program to encourage more visitors.
Even the Senate bill's champion, Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., has thrown their support behind security changes now. A Schumer aide, who would only speak on condition of anonymity, said the senator still supports their bill but added “the security provisions need to be strengthened in light of what happened” in Paris.
Industry groups said targeting the visa-waiver program won't make the country safer.
Melanie Hinton, a spokesperson for Airlines for America, said the visa waiver program helps “facilitate the movement of travelers to the United States, while maintaining the highest levels of security.”
The program, which allows visitors from about 40 countries to make short business and personal jaunts to the United States without a visa, does not exempt those foreigners from security screening and other vetting, Hinton noted.
Lobbyist Stewart Verdery, whose clients on visa issues include U.S. Travel, the U.S. Olympic Committee and technology company Sabre, said he's making the case to lawmakers that the United States has “multiple layers of checks,” and that protecting the homeland is more of an intelligence question than a visa-waiver concern. (The U.S. Olympic Committee has not taken a position on new visa waiver legislation, Verdery said.)
That's because the interviews and visa process likely only would flag someone if they had already been identified by intelligence agencies.
This story was updated to make clear the U.S. Olympic Committee has not taken a position on new visa waiver legislation.
XSS in Vue.js | In Security In Dev | By By Thibaud
While working at Sqreen, I put some time to look into Front-end Security issues. Of course, as you can guess, it has been widely documented on the web. As a VueJS enthusiast, I was happy to look into Cross-site scripting (XSS) possibilities with Vue and concerns that developers should have. This article's main goal is to help you know a bit more about XSS in general and Vue.JS in particular. We will try to create some XSS attacks, and see what tools we have to prevent them.
What is an XSS?
An XSS attack injects malicious code into someone else's web page.
Here is a quick example of an XSS performed with JQuery.
In the example above, you have a normal use case of displaying a username. What if you display a malicious username? Uncomment the second username and see what happens!
As you can see, we can inject into the username malicious code that allows us to retrieve cookies from anyone seeing the concerned page.
Is Injecting HTML possible in newer frameworks?
Injecting HTML is a feature available to any front end framework and used is by websites when part of the website HTML is generated by the server.
Here is the documentation for how some current frameworks perform HTML injection:
Let's focus on Vue.js
Can we perform an XSS attack?
Let's try to perform a basic XSS attack on the v-html directive:
<div id="app" > Welcome : <span v-html="attack"> </span> </div >
new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { attack: 'john doe', } });
Following along in this playground, we will try to inject different strings in the v-html directive and see if we can retrieve cookies.
new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { attack: '<script > alert(document.cookie)</script >', } });
Nothing happens. The browser prevent executing injected script tags after initial page load.
Let's try to inject in events from HTML tags.
new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { attack: '<a onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)>click me!</a>', } });
As you can see we are now using the <span style="font-weight: 400;">onmouseover event to retrieve the cookies. This is the result.
Interesting, we just found our first possible XSS with Vue. Let's dig a bit more:
new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { attack: '<img src="validUrl" onload=alert(document.cookie)>', } });
new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { attack: '<img src="notValidUrl" onerror=alert(document.cookie)>', } });
They work too!
Then I simply need to avoid v-html
It's not that simple. Chances are you use a UI library to help you handle UI interaction/display. Can a UI library use v-html inside a component without you knowing it? Let's see if we can find some interesting UI libraries using v-html.
Let's check Vux.
23 hits, now we can try to search for possible XSS attacks in Vue.js. In fact, we can perform some injections while not directly using v-html. Now let's try to attack it. Basically, we want to be able to perform malicious XSS when using the UI components.
Here is an example repository and demo of possible injections with UI libraries. This demo shows how to perform a simple XSS using commonly used UI components such as cards and modal. Other libraries such as vuetify offer great UI components while totally avoiding v-html.
In Vux, have you noticed that the prop header of the Card Component is XSS-able ? Using external UI library without checking the rendering methods used is risking yourself to a XSS.
How can I avoid XSS attacks?
Try to use as much as possible interpolated expressions {{}} , they are stringified and cannot be executed by the browser.
Do you need to inject HTML?
Be absolutely sure the data coming from your server is sanitized (node example).
Do you use an external UI library?
Be sure of how the data passed through props is rendered. Is it using v-html? document.write ?
How to protect your app against XSS without pain?
At Sqreen, we believe developers should be able to focus on developing their applications without having to constantly fear for security. We also believe developers deserve security tools that look like the other tools they use every day.
Sqreen will block attacks in your application (including NoSQL injections, SQL injections or XSS) without you having to take any action or to change your code. The best thing is that Sqreen takes literally 30 seconds to install in any app.
Conclusion
Don't worry, injecting HTML is not inherently bad and is very useful in other ways. However, it's the developer responsibility to be aware of this possibility and make sure XSS cannot happen. Whenever you are using a library responsible for displaying data, be aware of how it is displayed.

HARTFORD – It was a chaotic scene outside A.I. Prince Technical High School in Hartford Thursday morning as police and SWAT teams responded to a shooting threat. Inside the building, students and teachers were experiencing a different kind of chaos and fear as the school was in lockdown.
Sophomore Camani Bell took a short video on their phone while they were hiding in the corner of their classroom in silence. It captured their biology teacher guarding the door while holding a yardstick.
“I thought we were going to die, but she's like, ‘No. I have you guys. I will protect you. Just stay calm and stay put,'” said Bell.
Bell identified the teacher as Paula Butterfield, who Bell also has for homeroom.
“She stood at the door until it was clear,” said Bell, who said they aren't surprised Butterfield acted that way.
After the lockdown was lifted and police had detained the student who made the threat, Bell came home and showed their mother the video.
“I had to share it,” said Bell's mother Shamikia Pitts. “When you see good, you want to make sure that good is known.”
“I want to thank her, thank them so much because anything could have happened," Pitts said. "She did them job.”
It's the beginning of a new year, so I think it is a good time to venture outside of my "comfort zone" and try a completely new and different Linux distribution. In particular, one which is not a derivative of any of my usual selections (Debian/Fedora/openSuSE).
I have heard a lot of good things about Manjaro Linux, most importantly that it is one of the easiest Arch Linux derivatives to install, so I decided to give that a try.
If you are not familiar with Manjaro Linux (or Arch Linux), there are a couple of things you need to understand before we go on. Arch Linux is well known in the Linux community, with a reputation of being compact, fast, flexible, and very well maintained and supported by a dedicated community.
It is also generally considered requiring an experienced Linux user at least on the installation and maintenance level, because there is not a lot of time and effort invested in making user-friendly GUI tools for lots of things that experienced Linux admins consider 'trivial' and which can be handled from the command line interface in a very short time.
Manjaro Linux is derived from Arch Linux, with the objective of making the distribution a bit more user friendly in packaging and support.
There is a good overview of the origin and purpose in the Manjaro Wiki, specifically in the About Manjaro section. By the way, the Manjaro Wiki is one of the best I have seen in a while, and it seems to be kept very current with new releases and updates of the distribution.
The current release of Manjaro is 0.8.11, released on December 1, 2014. There have been several updates since then, most recently the fourth update released on January 4, 2015. The ISO files can be downloaded from the Sourceforge Manjaro Linux page. I found this page just a bit confusing at first, so I have included a screen shot of it here (see below).
If you click the 'latest version' link, what you will get is the minimal LXQt version, which is a great system to build on, but is likely to leave the average user (or beginner) scratching their head wondering what to do next. Fortunately, there are a lot of other versions available, you just have to click on the release folder, and then on the 0.8.11 folder. There you will finally see the Xfce, KDE, and netinstall folders. Each of those contains a 32-bit (i686) and 64-bit (x86_64) image, and the associated md5sum files and package lists.
The ISO file sizes range from about 475MB (32-bit netinstall) to about 1.6GB (64-bit KDE), so you can choose based on your wants, needs, and equipment. For those who still long for a Linux distribution which fits on one CD-R disk, the netinstall version fits the bill, and the brand-new LXQt version does too, coming in at about 635MB. Burning ISO images to disk is one of my least favorite activities, so I was pleased to see that these ISO images can be copied directly to a USB stick (using dd on Linux, or ImageWriter on Linux or Windows).
I have been fighting with UEFI-firmware systems and Linux installation for quite some time now, and I have learned the hard way not to get my hopes up in this area. For example, Kali Linux made a new release last year which was said to have "preliminary UEFI support". It didn't work at all on any of my UEFI systems. Then KaOS made a release just at the end of the year, again with "early UEFI support". Again it didn't work on any of my UEFI systems. So to be honest, I don't go looking for announcements of UEFI support any more. I just figure I'll download and try it, and if a miracle happens I will see it soon enough.
So you can imagine my surprise when I did nothing at all special, I just downloaded the ISO image, dd to a USB stick, plug that into one of my Acer Aspire (UEFI firmware) systems... and it booted! Whoa! I just about fell out of my chair!
So then I went back to the Manjaro Wiki, and found their excellent description of BIOS end UEFI. This is a really good summary of dealing with UEFI firmware from a Linux developer's point of view. It's a bit long on conspiracy theory for my taste - when considering UEFI issues I tend more toward Hanlon's razor - but what it says about the realities of dealing with UEFI-firmware systems, and the advice it gives for getting around problems, is really excellent.
What I have determined from the Manjaro Wiki and from my own tests on several UEFI-firmware systems is that with Secure Boot disabled, the Manjaro Linux ISO images boot and install, including installing and configuration the grub2-efi bootloader, with no problems. As I have said many times before, however, every UEFI implementation is different, so your results may vary. Of course, the ISO image boots just fine with Legacy Boot enabled on UEFI systems, and on MBR/BIOS systems.
My first installation was the Manjaro Xfce (64-bit) distribution. Here you can see the Live desktop, without the Removable Devices icons. There are desktop icons and menu Favorites for two different installers, one GUI- and one CLI-based. The CLI installer itself also has two different versions, one old and very stable, and one new and still in development. I have only used the GUI installer so far, and I have had no trouble with it, on either UEFI or MBR systems. Of course, you can also use this Live system to check the overall compatibility and performance of Manjaro on your system before deciding to install it to the hard drive.
The Xfce version installed so easily, and looked so good, that I decided to go ahead and install the KDE version on another computer. I got out my Asus R513C, which is a 15-inch screen, quad-core CPU laptop, also with UEFI boot.
Manjaro KDE Live booted on that with no problems, and the KDE Plasma Live desktop makes for an interesting comparison with the Xfce desktop. It's probably not a fair comparison, since the Xfce desktop and icons could hardly be more bland, and the KDE desktop and icons are quite colorful and pleasing.
The differences in the selection of applications and packages included in the two different versions is also interesting. The KDE version stays much closer to the standard KDE Software Collection, so it doesn't include things like Firefox, Thunderbird, and LibreOffice, and the Xfce version is a bit more 'adventurous' and includes GIMP and Steam.

The current Manjaro installation images include Linux kernel 3.16.x. But there are actually a variety of kernels available, all you have to do is go into the Software Manager, and if you want to run the 3.18 kernel, search for linux318. Install that, reboot, and as of today you'll be running 3.18.1. If you want to see what kernels are available, search for linux3, and you'll get the current list. The oldest I see is 3.10, but not every version from there to 3.18 is included.
My Acer Aspire E11 is well known for having a cranky Broadcom 43142 wi-fi card, so I decided to see how much trouble that was to get working. It wasn't any trouble at all. Again, go to the Software Manager and search for broadcom-wl. Scan through the list that comes up, and select the driver version that matches the kernel you are running - 316 is the default at this time, or whatever you have updated to. I am running 3.18 on that system, so I selected linux318-broadcom-wl, let it install and then rebooted, and the wifi is working perfectly.
There is a similar situation with the Asus laptop, although its Atheros AR9485 wifi adapter is supported with a FOSS driver, to get it working I've had to copy the file asus_nb_wmi.conf into the directory /etc/modprobe.d on every Linux distribution I have installed on it so far. (I discussed this in my original post about installing Linux on the Asus.) This was still the case with the Linux 3.16 kernel which is initially installed with Manjaro, but when I subsequently installed the 3.18 kernel, I found that the wi-fi works without that file. Hooray!
In addition to the Xfce and KDE distributions which I have discussed here, Manjaro also has a netinstall distribution, which includes the base Linux installation and command-line access, but no GUI or desktop preinstalled, and essentially no other preinstalled software. This can then be used as a base for someone who wants to 'build' their own Linux system.
In addition to those three 'official' versions, there are a variety of 'community' releases, with different purposes and different desktops, configurations, and targets. The ISO images are also available from Sourceforge; simply follow the community folder (rather than release). A new Gnome version was announced while I have been writing this; there is also an LXQt version, which is basically the netinstall version with a minimal GUI desktop and utilities added, so that you don't have to follow the procedure detailed in the Manjaro Wiki. There are also Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, Openbox, Fluxbox and Enlightenment community versions available.
OK, it's summary time. I'm pleased and impressed: installing Manjaro was easier than I expected. Not only was it easier to install than some of the other distributions I have tried recently, but it is also UEFI-compatible, only requiring that UEFI Secure Boot be disabled.
The applications and packages included are a good selection, pretty much appropriate for the general intent or most common use of their respective desktops, and of course the software repositories contain all sorts of other things which are not included in the base distributions, so if something you want is missing after installation, you are almost certainly going to be able to install it with very little effort.
I have installed Manjaro on six of my systems: three Xfce and three KDE, four of them are UEFI firmware systems, the other two are MBR boot, and a couple of them have some sort of hardware that has been troublesome with other distributions. Every one of them installed with no problem, and the troublesome hardware was handled with minimal effort.
If you have been looking for a reasonably easy entry into the Arch Linux family of distributions, I can certainly recommend Manjaro based on my experience so far. But beyond that, if you are just looking for a good Linux distribution that installs easily and works well, I can recommend Manjaro for that as well.

Numerous elected Republicans, up to and including Donald Trump, have falsely accused the town hall resistance of being made up of paid protesters. But according to The Arizona Republic, it is the Republicans who are openly paying people to protest at Democratic town halls.
In a particularly despotic and disturbing move, Donald Trump spent their Easter trying to intimidate protesters, while also explicitly accusing them of being paid to show up at Tax Day demonstrations.
Trump's accusation has been echoed by many other Republicans, refuted by the town hall constituents themselves, and debunked by Politifact.
The accusation is an odd one coming from a person whose own Federal Elections Commission filings show that he, in fact, paid actors to attend their own campaign launch, but the hypocrisy runs even deeper than that. According to The Arizona Republic, the Republican Party of Arizona sent an email soliciting attendance at a town hall event for Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and offering to reimburse attendees to the tune of $25:
The email noted that to attend the event required joining the coffee club and paying $25. “If someone does have to pay, the Party is willing to reimburse the expense,” the email stated. Kory Langhofer, attorney for the state Republican Party, said if people are reimbursed the $25 entry fee, the party will “make sure it's fully disclosed and reported correctly. As long as the transaction is disclosed and transparent, it's perfectly acceptable,” they said.
Such reimbursements may well be “acceptable” as a matter of law, but for a party that accuses others of paying for resistance, it is hypocritical in the extreme.
Fortunately, even at the relatively cheap price of 25 bucks a head, there is not enough money in the world to equal the resistance to Trump that has grown from the grassroots, free of charge.
Now that's a patriotic streak!
Caitlyn Jenner will appear on a summer cover of Sports Illustrated wearing “nothing but an American flag and their Olympic medal,” a source reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.
The 66-year-old I Am Cait star (formerly known as Bruce) set a world decathlon record at the 1976 Montreal Summer Games. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of their win, she'll pose with their gold medal for the first time post-transition, adds the source: “She's excited about that.” (Her ex-wife Kris appeared topless with a medal during a 2007 photo shoot on Keeping Up With the Kardashians.)
Until now, Jenner says, they had stashed their “most prized possession” at the bottom of their makeup drawer.
“I never wanted my kids to feel like they had to have a gold medal in order to be considered a success,” the father of Kylie, 18, Kendall, 20, Brody, 32, Brandon, 34, Casey, 35, and Burt, 37, wrote in an August 2015 blog post. “I didn't want them to constantly compare their own achievements to my time in the Olympics, so I haven't displayed my medal.”
Jenner revealed their new name and identity on the July 2015 cover of Vanity Fair, and has since advocated for equality across the LGBTQ community.
“I'm very proud of this,” the reality star said of their medal in a video accompanying the blog entry. “That was a great time in my life. But to be honest with you, it's even a greater time in my life right now with what I'm trying to accomplish.”
The Olympian's latest triumph came amid the country's transgender bathroom debate, when GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, 69, permitted them to use the bathroom of their choice at their properties.
“OK, last week Donald Trump said I could take a pee anywhere in a Trump facility, so I am gonna go take a pee in the ladies' room,” Jenner shared on Facebook April 27. "Thank you, Donald. I really appreciate it.”

GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- The city's 2012 voter-approved amendment to decriminalize marijuana has withstood two legal challenges, but a third is on the horizon. Tim McMorrow, appeals division attorney with the Kent County Prosecutor's office, said they expect to ask the state Supreme Court to hear the case. McMorrow's comment comes as the
. City voters in November 2012 approved a charter amendment to make the possession of small amounts of marijuana a civil infraction instead of a misdemeanor. A few months later, police began writing civil citations. Kent County Prosecutor William Forsyth soon filed a lawsuit against the amendment and city. Kent County Circuit Court Judge Paul Sullivan in May 2013 rejected the challenge. Forsyth appealed again.
Related:
In today's ruling, justices said they don't believe the infraction law conflicts with state marijuana statutes as argued by Forsyth. The amendment created a civil infraction, justices wrote, but does not prohibit prosecutors from elevating a violation to a misdemeanor. Prosecutors also argued the amendment inappropriately prohibits Grand Rapids police from reporting certain marijuana infractions to the prosecutor's office.

But justices again disagreed. They said police have no obligation to notify prosecutors about violations. McMorrow contends justices simply got it wrong. "I disagree with their analysis," they said. Jack Hoffman, who represented a group called Decriminalize GR, said they were pleased with the ruling. "It's a good day for the city," they said. "I think everybody on our side would prefer it not be appealed. We should just all get together on the same page and go forward," Hoffman said. Tyler Nickerson, a spokesperson for Decriminalize GR, said they were glad to see the appeals court rule on the side of more than 40,000 voters who supported the charter amendment in 2012. "We felt from the beginning this had good legal standing," they said.

Report: 92% Of Conversions Occur After Heated Facebook Argument
U.S.—A full 92% of conversions to Christ are the direct result of being “argued into the Kingdom” after the nonbeliever engages in a heated, virulent argument with a Christian, a report by the LifeWay Research confirmed Thursday.
“What our survey and additional research found is what many believers in Christ have long suspected,” a representative told reporters. “Engaging a skeptic online with the intent of shouting them down in a hostile manner is far more effective than other evangelistic methods, like kindness leading to repentance, attempting to understand their position, or just humbly explaining the gospel.”
According to the survey results, the effect was most pronounced when the Christian debater uses harsh language, memes, and threats of hellfire. Further, the poll showed that political arguments in general are responsible for millions of conversions per year.
Other online sources of conversion—such as spamming comments sections with one's Christian blog posts and trolling nonbelievers on Twitter—were also popular and effective, the study showed.
For centuries, practitioners of the Druze religion took care not to reveal any information about the nature of their beliefs, rituals, and traditions. Under penalty of communal ostracism, or worse, members of Druze communities have refrained from telling any outsider more than basic details about their religion.
'Druze here are too fearful to loudly proclaim their sympathies with Israel, or to convert to Judaism, although some do – because of the fear of what might happen to their brethren in Syria and Lebanon.'
But now, the secret is out. Druze MK Ayoub Kara (Likud) says members of the Druze communities believe in many of the same things that Jews do. And that's not surprising, they add, since the Druze are actually descended from the Jewish people - and they say they can bring genetic evidence to prove it.
According to Kara, who is politically allied with the Jewish nationalist camp, there are many aspects of Druze beliefs that mesh with Judaism: “All our prophets are Jewish ones – Moses, Judah, Jethro, and Zevulun, the son of Jacob.” In fact, they say, the Druze are likely one of the lost tribes of the Jewish people – probably Zevulun, considering their special status among them.
According to Kara, there are no vestigial Jewish practices among the Druze – as there are, surprisingly, among some Arabs in the Land of Israel – but one symbol has stuck with the Druze throughout the centuries. “Only among Druze do you find a red Star of David, in homes, cemeteries, and places of worship,” Kara says. “This is one sign that has been open and visible for centuries, unlike most of the other ones, yet few have noticed.”
If the Druze dropped most, if not all, Jewish ritual, it's because they feared the sword of Islam. “Unlike Jews and Christians, who have the status of “people of the Book” among Muslims, and are therefore are given some basic rights, Druze are simply heretics to Islam, and such heretics must be either converted or eliminated,” Kara explains. In fact, Druze were massacred by Muslims on several occasions, and “it would have been much worse if they had identified themselves as Jews.” As a result, the Druze initially converted to Christianity and subsequently took on a Muslim identity – but through it all, they never forgot their Jewish identity.
Those roots explain, at least in part, the fierce loyalty the Druze in Israel have to the state. “However, Druze here are too fearful to loudly proclaim their sympathies with Israel, or to convert to Judaism, although some do – because of the fear of what might happen to their brethren in Syria and Lebanon,” Kara said. Druze soldiers have given their lives for Israel and have risen high in IDF ranks. However, Druze tradition is to be loyal to whatever country rules the area they live in, so that Druze in Syria are loyal to Syria.
And then there is the genetic study, which shows that Druze display genetic attributes quite similar to those of Jews (see the study for the technical details). “A major genetic test from last year, the first extensive test done of the Druze, proves my contention clearly,” says Kara.
Not all experts are convinced – at least not yet. Tsvi MiSinai, an Israeli author who has conducted extensive investigations into the cultural and genetic background of the Arabs living west of the Jordan River, and who has concluded that the vast majority of them are descended from the Jewish nation, believes that more study is necessary. “According to the study, the genetic cluster of Druze coincides closely with those of the Samaritans, and is very close to the genetic clusters of Ashkenazim, Sephardim, and Jews from the Caucasus,” says MiSinai, author of an ambitious study on “Jewish nationhood” called “Brother Shall Not Lift Sword Against Brother.”
While the evidence so far is persuasive, MiSinai wants to see more. “We know from history that there were definitely Jewish villages that became part of the Druze community, mostly to avoid being forced to convert to Islam, such as the residents of the villages of Abu Snein and Yarcha. If the genetic samples were taken from there, it doesn't say much about the rest of the Druze. I would want to see more of an in-depth study,” MiSinai says.
Kara says that their evidence stands on its own merits. “For thousands of years the Druze suffered,” they said, “so it's understandable that they would be a little hesitant to come forward after only 60 years of Israel's existence. But when you check our beliefs – and our veneration of the great Jewish prophets – the matter should become clear.”

Russell would later claim that everything they did as a trainee photographer broke the rules—a trend they continued throughout their career as a film director when producing such acclaimed movies as Women in Love, The Music Lovers, The Devils, Tommy, Altered States and Crimes of Passion.
Russell became a photographer for Picture Post and the Illustrated Magazine, and during their time with these publications took some of the most evocative photos of post-war London during the 1950s. They spent their days photographing street scenes and their nights printing their pictures on the kitchen table of their rented one-bed apartment in Notting Hill.
For fifty years, it was believed Russell's photos had been lost, but in 2005 a box marked “Ken Russell” was discovered in the archives of a photo library. Inside was over 3,000 of Ken's negatives.
Among their most famous work from this period is “The Last of the Teddy Girls”—a series of photos documenting London's girl gang subculture and their male counterparts. Russell was attracted to these young women for their sense of independence and style—dressing in suits, land army clothes—while rejecting society's expectations of more traditional, feminine roles. (Teddy kids of either sex were known for fights breaking out wherever they congregated.) The images show Russell's innate talent for composition and offer a fascinating look into a rarely documented female subculture.

Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have been trapped in a no-win situation ever since January 27th, 2014. That was the day that Macklemore thought they were doing the right thing and reacted. They did what most rapper's shouldn't do, they let their guard down and attempted to be genuine by sending a text to Kendrick Lamar after The Heist beat good kid, m.A.A.d. city for the 2014 “Best Rap Album” at the Grammys.
“You got robbed,” they wrote in a text message to Lamar. “I wanted you to win. You should have. It's weird and sucks that I robbed you. I was gonna say that during the speech then the music started playing during my speech and I froze. Anyway, you know what it is. Congrats on this year and your music. Appreciate you as an artist and as a friend. Much love.”
But what Macklemore ultimately did was succumb to the pressure of a world that said they didn't deserve to take home the Grammy that night. Whether they did or didn't deserve it really didn't matter because our short term memory would have allowed us to get over it. Taylor Swift has snatched numerous awards from the fictional kung fu grip of black artists and they haven't once apologized. Nobody cares that much. But being the honest fellow that they are, Macklemore wanted to let Kendrick Lamar – and then the world – know that they didn't feel they should have won the award. And the only way they felt they could prove that they aren't another average white man stealing accolades from an above average black man was to make their text to Kendrick public.
Bad decision—because that kind of admission, no matter how well intended it was, will only draw more criticism as being an opportunist.
They later admitted that they “betrayed” Kendrick's trust by posting the text on Instagram but the error was opening themselves up for criticism and letting the world know that they can get to him.
Once you do that, it never ends. It's kind of like a journalist responding in the comment section. It opens Pandora's Box and you'll have a helluva time trying to close it as the readers have realized how easy it is to get a reaction out of you. Now you're going to be needled more than ever.
This Unruly Mess I Made is an extension of Macklemore reacting to what the world thinks about them and apologizing for who they are. In a strange way it's like they see the glass half empty instead of half full despite all of the accolades they earned. It's not uncommon to feel guilty for your success, but the shit that is heaped on top of Macklemore is unfair. Nevertheless, Macklemore's greatest strength on This Unruly Mess I Made becomes their biggest detriment.
For starters, “Light Tunnels” quite literally sets the stage for this unruly mess that Macklemore has made by recounting the night that began this chain reaction of justifications that were completely unnecessary. They recognize their “white privilege” and apologizes for it tirelessly. But when you're not liked, you're just not going to be liked. And no amount of apologizing will change that. The six-minute plus narrative that traverses Macklemore's thoughts is well done but if you aren't vibing with the subject matter then it was a lost cause before it ever started.
Elsewhere on the album, Macklemore accomplished what a lot of us wish our hip hop peers would do on a song like the B-Boy opera “Downtown” where the Seattle emcee grabs hip hop legends Melle Mel, Grandmaster Caz and Kool Moe Dee and places them on a single that is intended for the mainstream. Most rappers wouldn't dare risk it. But maybe it's because Macklemore is white that he's able to do this (and rhyme about riding a moped). Or, maybe it's because he's a decent rapper who respects the culture and figures that the reward outweighs the risk. They likely don't even know. The manner in which they and Ryan Lewis go all Artifacts “Wrong Side Of The Tracks” meets Nas “New York State of Mind” on “Buckshot” alongside KRS-One and DJ Premier should garner them more praise than he's been credited for.
But Macklemore & Ryan Lewis don't simply attempt to play Doc to the Golden Era, put it in a DeLorean and bring it back to the future. They also scoop up a collection of their contemporaries and allows them to shine in environments they are familiar with.
It's at this point that I want to take a break from Macklemore and speak about the underrated brilliance of Ryan Lewis on this project.
Listen, you can talk bad about Macklemore all you want because if it really is their voice and style that affects you like nails on a chalkboard, then that's your axe to rightfully grind. We all have our annoyances. But you absolutely cannot front on the chameleon-like work of Ryan Lewis behind the boards. What Lewis accomplishes on This Unruly Mess I Made is downright brilliant. The production morphs on a whim and is fitting for whatever mood that is supposed to be projected. You want harrowing hood tales with twinkling keys and dark guitar plucks, “Bolo Tie” captures that and YG stomps all over it. If A Thriller-esque backdrop where Idris Elba can do their best Vincent Price impersonation as Macklemore goofs off about their inadequacies on the dance floor is what you want, Ryan Lewis gives it to you in spades on “Dance Off.” A backdrop reminiscent of Public Enemy's “He Got Game” where Macklemore can lament about gentrification in Seattle along with their own bouts with alcoholism? Oh yeah, “St. Ides” is for you.
In all honesty, Ryan Lewis deserves a great deal of praise for this album being cohesive while harnessing many different forms of energy. He's arguably the most talented producer that is tied to a single rapper. Perhaps he'll find work outside of Macklemore because the world can really use more Ryan Lewis if they can churn out headrockers like “Bolo Tie” when necessary.
Interestingly enough, this very album (and, honestly, the one before it) would have been praised if Macklemore weren't white. There's a unique undercurrent of reverse xenophobia that exists with Macklemore.
Let's be honest, if Kanye made “Same Love” he'd be called a genius. Or, and perhaps more importantly, if Macklemore had the same bravado for “Same Love” as Kanye did with “Jesus Walks,” he'd force us to call them a genius. And I use Kanye as an example because they display similar ability on the mic. Meaning, they aren't the greatest lyricists around but both have a penchant for the vulnerable and emotional just as much as they do the cringe-worthy.
If you want to find somebody to compare Macklemore to, try Bernie Sanders. No, Bernie isn't always going to get Black issues right because, well, he's white. But he's trying and that's far more than what that knucklehead Ben Carson will ever do with their life in terms of tackling civil rights issues. But there are ignorant people out there that will roll with Ben because he's Black and will find something wrong with Sanders because he's white. Sometimes it is really that simple. Obviously, those with better comprehension on political issues can dissect the flaws with Sanders rhetoric. Because the biggest problem for Sanders has been that they expect minorities to eventually come around. However, when you aren't speaking their language directly to them, you cannot simply expect them to align with your cause. He's got the right idea, but the wrong plan. Same with Macklemore.
The worst part about all of this is that people treat Macklemore like he's Iggy Azalea. They didn't just pick up a microphone and start rhyming a few years ago. Macklemore had toiled in the underground from 2000 to 2013 and then “Thrift Shop” took off and never came down. The inevitable backlash from bursting on the scene as a white rapper soon followed and Macklemore didn't want to be swept up in the same dustpan as other white rappers in the mainstream who don't recognize their own white privilege once they get past the initial salvo of being white and trying to rap.
Look, if Macklemore's music isn't for you as a minority, that's fine. Maybe the things they talk about simply don't fit into your daily narrative. But to despise the man for talking about what they know is kind of bizarre. Would it be any better if they rapped about growing up in the “hood” with one of those stories where they were the cool white dude amongst black friends? Or, would you appreciate them more if they had a video leak out where they dropped the N-bomb? Admittedly, I wasn't a fan of Friends because I didn't see enough black faces on the show. I simply couldn't relate. However, I didn't hate it. It just wasn't for me. But it seems that people go out of their way to hate Macklemore. And that's simply an unfair assessment.
Which leads me to “White Privilege II” and where every emotion that has been invoked within Macklemore manifests itself. It's less a song and more of something that should be performed on Broadway by spoken word poets seeking to spread the message about white guilt as their theatrical work comes to a close.
In the end, This Unruly Mess I Made only struggles to find its footing when its more reactive than proactive. “Let's Eat” is simply a fun song that some will find corny but its all Macklemore. Arguably the best song on the project is the collaboration with Chance The Rapper on “Need To Know” where both artists lament about the balancing between feeling what's authentic versus doing what's politically correct. It's almost a microcosm of the album when Chance's hook proclaims “I'm going to tell you what you need to know, I'm going to tell you what you need to hear, ‘cause the truth would be too much.” That hook resonates because, for Macklemore, it's all too real.
I can think of a lot of rappers who deserve more criticism than Macklemore has received since their rise to stardom. No, this album isn't a classic. But it's also not as bad as some of the disparagement it has received (check USA Today's review). There is no blindsiding moment like “Thrift Shop” or a feel-good chest thumper like “Can't Hold Us” but there are some moments of insightful revelation that finds Macklemore adjusting to the fame in the most honest way they can.
And if you can hate on that, I'm not sure what to tell you.
Honestly, the best thing that can happen to Macklemore is how this album has performed thus far (50k sold first week). It allows them to drift out of the limelight and take the fans who have stuck around with him. And with the heat of the spotlight off of their neck, they can clean up the unruly mess they think he's responsible for.
Hewlett-Packard's TouchPad tablet is set for one final production run.
After that, the TouchPad will be dead -- unless of course HP decides to bring it back to life, as mentioned as a possibility by an HP exec earlier today.
But, for now, the plan is to kill the HP TouchPad after this one last hurrah.
HP isn't saying how many TouchPads it will make in its farewell run, or when exactly the last gasp of tablets will land in stores, or even exactly which stores will sell the tablets (HP's online store is a safe bet).
Nonetheless, more TouchPads are on the way in the next few weeks at the same $99 (for a 16-gigabyte model) or $149 (for 32 gigabytes) to meet demand that persisted after the device had sold out across stores in the U.S. and Canada, HP spokesperson Mark Budgell said in a company blog post.
"Since we announced the price drop, the number of inquiries about the product and the speed at which it disappeared from inventory has been stunning," Budgell said. "I think it's safe to say we were pleasantly surprised by the response."
Once HP cut the TouchPad down to as low as $99, the device sold out and inspired lines of people lining up outside Best Buy and other retailers, all of which is contributing to the firm's move to give its TouchPad another production run.
When the device first hit stores July 1, at a starting price of $499 (the same as Apple's iPad), it sat on store shelves and failed to lure any significant number of consumers. Afterward, the firm decided to end production of the TouchPad and all its other devices using the Web OS operating system.
"Despite announcing an end to manufacturing Web OS hardware, we have decided to produce one last run of TouchPads to meet unfulfilled demand," Budgell said. "We don't know exactly when these units will be available or how many we'll get, and we can't promise we'll have enough for everyone. We do know that it will be at least a few weeks before you can purchase."
Budgell added a list of frequently asked questions to their blog post, addressing questions on topics such as the availability of accessories and why some retailers (such as Wal-Mart) aren't taking part in the price drop like everyone else. Budgell directs readers to ask retailers, not offering an HP-sourced answer himself).
So, could more TouchPads, or even a newer, slimmer, faster, lighter TouchPad 2 arrive after the final run that wasn't supposed to have even happened? Now that HP has a TouchPad user base of possibly a few hundred thousand to either ignore or nurture, the answer to that question is even less clear than when the company announced it was discontinuing the devices Aug. 18.
It also remains unclear not only what HP has planned for the TouchPad and webOS, but also its PC business, which is the world's largest, yet also a unit that HP wants to either sell of spin off.
Despite all the uncertainty, the TouchPad seems to be a tablet that just won't die.
What do you think? Is HP making the right call in offering one final run of low-priced TouchPads? Should HP follow through and give up on the TouchPad? Or does all of this make a case for a newer, lower-priced TouchPad at a later date, maybe when HP knows what it's doing with its PC business? Sounds off in the comments below.

AP Photo / Marty Lederhandler The trial of the five men charged over the September 11 attacks on America will not be televised and may not begin for another four years, it has been disclosed.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and their four co-conspirators are due to be tried at Guantanamo Bay military base for the murders of 2,976 people in what has been dubbed the 'trial of the century'.
But yesterday both the prosecution and defence conceded that the trial will not be televised, unlike many high profile trials in America.
And the defence claimed that, while the hearings have begun, they do not expect that actual trial to start until 2016 - 15 years after the attacks which prompted the USA's war on terror and remain the worst terror atrocity in history.
Unlike in the UK, many US trials are broadcast on television and can be watched at home.
High profile cases such as the trial of OJ Simpson and that of Conrad Murray, the doctor accused of killing Michael Jackson, have been televised in America, as have many other US trials.
But yesterday the military prosecutor Brigadier General Mark Martins said that the trial of the 9/11 conspirators would not be broadcast on television, as per the current laws surrounding military commissions. They said: "The government position is that the rule works."
They said that a "fair and appropriate balance" would be to have the trial screened in selected military bases and courtrooms in the USA.
But James Connell, one of the defence lawyers, expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of television cameras and said that the defence had made representations to the judge, but that the prosecution opposed.
They said: "We have asked for the proceedings to be televised on a feed to commercial television outlets.
"The defence position is that there should be a television feed of this so that members of the public, whether they are victims' families or people who are interested in these proceedings in the US or worldwide can watch.
"Having a couple of military bases [with a feed] is hardly the same."
The alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is due to stand trial along with their Pakistani nephew Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, also known as Ammar al-Baluchi; Mustapha al-Hawsawi of Saudi Arabia; and Yemenis Ramzi Binalshibh and Walid bin Attash.
The five face the death penalty if convicted for their roles in the terror attacks by al-Qaeda militants in which hijacked planes were used to strike New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006, the five men were held in secret CIA prisons, where they were subjected to interrogation tactics which they say amounted to torture.
The prosecution estimated that the trial was on schedule to begin in June or July next year, but Mr Connell said that they believed it would be much longer, suggesting four years from now as a realistic timescale.
They said: "I recall General Martin talking [in May] about the [Zacarias] Moussaoui case taking four years and I remember thinking at the time that seemed like a reasonable estimate for this case.
"I think it is a long time. It seems comparable to other major terrorism trials."
Mr Connell said their prediction was based on the "enormous" amount of paperwork the defence still has to read through.
They added: "The prosecution has been preparing for this case for 11 years. It makes sense that now they have gotten round to bringing this case that there needs to be time for all of the information they have spent 11 years digesting that the defence needs time to digest that."
They added that the decision to hold the trial in Guantanamo Bay rather than New York - a decision taken by the US Government - will also play a part in the delay.
"There is no question that the trial would be quicker in another jurisdiction. There are a lot of issues that would not have to be tackled." They added that one such problem was "the difficulty of getting people here."
The predictions came as a series of pre-trial hearings were set to begin at the base in Cuba. Those hearings, which were scheduled to last six days, were cancelled amid fears that a tropical storm is due to hit the island. All non-essential personnel -about 200 people - are set to be evacuated from the island as tropical storm Isaac approaches.
Joe, an engineer from Wisconsin, modified the (now censored) designs for Defense Distributed's 3D printed gun, the Liberator, and printed a working model on a Lulzbot A0-101, a $1,725 consumer printer that is much cheaper and more widely available than the Stratasys Dimension SST printer used by Defense Distributed.
The gun printed by Joe, which he's nicknamed the “Lulz Liberator,” was printed over 48 hours with just $25 of plastic on a desktop machine affordable to many consumers, and was fired far more times. “People think this takes an $8,000 machine and that it blows up on the first shot. I want to dispel that,” says Joe. “This does work, and I want that to be known.”
Eight of Joe's test-fires were performed using a single barrel before swapping it out for a new one on the ninth. After all those shots, the weapon's main components remained intact–even the spiraled rifling inside of the barrel's bore. “The only reason we stopped firing is because the sun went down,” they say....
...Still, Joe's cheap homemade gun isn't without its bugs. Over the course of its test firing, Joe and Guslick say it misfired several times, and some of its screws and its firing pin had to be replaced. After each firing, the ammo cartridges expanded enough that they had to be pounded out with a hammer. “Other than that, it's pretty much confirming that yes, Defense Distributed is correct that this functions,” says Guslick. “And it's possible to make one on a much lower cost printer.”
Image caption President Barack Obama and the Prime Minister David Cameron have been turned into jugs
Prime Minister David Cameron has been given a makeover ahead of next week's G8 summit in Fermanagh - in ceramic at least.
Immortalised as a Toby jug he's been glazed in salt along with the other world leaders, including the US President Barack Obama.
Together they make up a display at the Ulster Museum in Belfast.
They were designed by County Down-based ceramic artist, Peter Meanly, who hopes to gift them to the leaders at the conference centre.
"When I heard David Cameron announce in November that they had selected Northern Ireland as the host for the G8, I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to make them," Mr Meanly said.
The artist said they had spoken to Secretary of State, Teresa Villiers, about the jugs and they hope that they will see that they are given to the politicians.
"I want the prime minister to present them. This is a free gift from me to them and it will do Northern Ireland a lot of good."
The jugs took four and a half months to make and, unless they're snapped up by the world leaders next week, you can see them at the entrance of the museum.
There are a number of very interesting cues to potential future motorsport directions in the press release for the launch of the new of 2015 Renaultsport R.S. 01 one make ‘GT' car, previewed on DSC some weeks ago as the car is unveiled today at the Moscow Motor Show.
The carbon monocoqued sub 1,100 kg car is powered by a NISMO prepared 3.8 litre V6 twin-turbo engine, derived from the Nissan GT-R unit and developing over 500 hp and maximum torque of more than 600 N.m. It is able to reach a top speed of over 300 kph.
The engine is though fitted with a dry sump system intended to prevent oil surges during long corners. The performance level of the Renaultsport R.S. 01 is between a GT3 and a DTM car.
From next season the new car will feature in a new arm of the World Series by Renault package in a new championship, the Renaultsport Trophy, described in potentially prescient fashion by Renault as “a springboard for the professional GT and Endurance championships.”
The chassis is designed and built by Dallara. The tub, which includes the 150 litre fuel tank, features a steel roll cage at the top. Front and rear crash boxes contribute to an assembly that Renault say “respects FIA LMP1 2014 standards to ensure safety”.
There is no mention in the launch material of any there motorsport plans for the R.S01 platform. Renault describe it's introduction into their product range thus:
“An organiser of motorsports events for 40 years, Renaultsport is entering a new phase with Renaultsport R.S. 01. The new car will add a fresh dimension to customer sport and to talent-spotting among pilots and amateur drivers. Renaultsport R.S. 01 will compete in the Renaultsport Trophy championship, an event built to measure. This one-make series, which will be part of the World Series by Renault from 2015, will be a new opportunity for “Pro-Am” teams, and a gateway to the GT, DTM, ELMS and WEC championships.”
Renaultsport Trophy, a new event for the 2015 season
Patrice Ratti, CEO of Renault Sport Technologies
“Renaultsport R.S. 01 marks the start of a new line. For this reason, it was named in tribute to Renault's very first Formula 1 car.
“We wanted to design the best racing car in order to bring to light the best talent and prepare the next generation of drivers. Renaultsport R.S. 01 is a vehicle of exceptional performance and the World Series by Renault will be its showcase. We started from scratch in developing Renaultsport Trophy. It is an attractive event that stands out among existing motorsport events. With “Pro-Am” teams and a sports program combining sprinting and endurance, we will create a gateway to the higher series.”
The new car, and it's one-make series are being positioned between the Clio Cup events and professional championships, such as the WEC, DTM and Japanese Super GT.
The 2015 season will be open to twenty “Pro-Am” teams, classified according to the rules of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). At World Series by Renault meetings, competitors will be able to maximise their time on the track by taking part in a real one-make championship called Renaultsport Trophy.
Track time is currently estimated at more than four hours per car and per driver, over a three-day weekend.
A gateway to Japan and Le Mans
Alongside prize money for the best drivers and teams in each round, Renault Sport Technologies and its partners have also given some initial details of a range of interesting end-of-season rewards.
“The champion in the “Pro” category will have the chance to follow a complete development programme (simulator, physical preparation, media training, etc.) prior to taking a rookie test with the official Nismo team for the Super GT in Japan. If they or they have the qualities required, they will be able to pursue their career in this extremely competitive discipline.
“A similarly attractive reward will be provided for the “Am” champion, who will have the chance to take part in the 2016 Le Mans 24-Hour event driving an LMP2 prototype.”

We are at a standstill with a dead repository and would like to bring it back to life. Our only problem is, it's lacking so much documentation, it's almost unusable.
We are able to make a connection to the network, show when people connect, disconnect, and who all is online.
Here is the repo in question. The file to keep an eye on is /lib/node.js (not to be confused with NodeJS itself).
Here is what we have to show for it:
var Node = require('n2n').Node; var node = new Node(5146); console.log("Connecting to the network...
"); node.connect([{ host: 'bradleypl.us', port: 5146 }]); node.on('online', function () { console.log('Your ID:', this.id); console.log('Online ids:', node.sortedIds); }); //just for testing, this will spam the terminal if repeated every time. node.on('node::online', function (newNode) { console.log('Someone is online:', newNode.id); }); //just for testing, this will spam the terminal if repeated every time. node.on('node::offline', function () { console.log('Someone just left!'); });
This is where we have no idea what to so. Now how does one send messages? We can see something like:
node.broadcast("node::test","message");
Being used to send a "node::test" event to everyone on the network. That is then received with:
node.on("node::test", function (message) { console.log("New message:",message); }
But that doesn't work... Any idea?
While the indie publishing policies of Xbox and PlayStation capture a lot of attention in the press and social media, the state of Nintendo's do-it-yourself scene is a relative blip on the game industry radar.
But the truth is that Nintendo, just like its console rivals, is becoming increasingly friendly to small, independent developers. Tools and initiatives like Nintendo Web Framework, Unity engine support, eShop distribution and self-publishing mean more opportunities for developers that have limited resources.
Over email, we contacted around 20 Wii U eShop indie developers, most of which were featured in the Nintendo Direct webcast for the UK (Nintendo of America's webcast did not highlight such a wide array of eShop indies, for some reason).
The most interesting answers are provided, in their words, in the roundtable on the following pages. But first, here are the quick takeaways from our Q&As:
On Wii U's lagging sales
Wii U is selling poorly. eShop developers ranged from not concerned at all, to very concerned about the growth of the installed base. Many noted, however, that there is a blue ocean upside – there's less noise on the eShop, so it's theoretically easier to stand out right now. Others noted that their teams are small, and a Unity port requires little effort, so they might as well try to expand their audience, despite the relatively meager audience. Everyone said they're hoping Nintendo can turn the sales situation around.
On how Nintendo can help them sell more games
Many eShop developers said the Wii U's digital storefront needs to be streamlined, and offer better discovery of games. They also said Nintendo needs to do what it can to sell more Wii U systems in order to expand the potential customer base, and that might boil down to better communicating to the mass market what the system has to offer. A couple developers added that Nintendo needs to be more transparent about digital sales on eShop (one studio is bringing its game to eShop mainly to find out how many games typically sell on the storefront).
On working with Nintendo
While some developers were hesitant to recommend to other developers bringing their game to eShop because of software sales uncertainty, all developers we spoke with were happy with their experience in working with Nintendo. The company has apparently been generous with loaner development kits and general developer support. According to developers we spoke with, Nintendo has been responsive to the needs of the free-to-play business model as well.

CARLTON and the Western Bulldogs are the clubs most vulnerable to free agency raids next year, each having seven prospective free agents on their lists.
After releasing a list of 2014's highest-profile free agents in June, AFL.com.au has compiled a more extensive list of next year's free agency pool.
The Blues set to become free agents at the end of next season include skipper Marc Murphy, 2006 No.1 draft pick Bryce Gibbs, 2013 best and fairest winner Kade Simpson and key defender Michael Jamison.
The Bulldogs' prospective free agents include 2013 All Australian ruckman Will Minson and injury-prone pair Shaun Higgins and Tom Williams.
Other big-name players able to explore free agency next year include Magpies Dane Swan and Ben Reid, Fremantle midfielder David Mundy, Melbourne key defender James Frawley, North Melbourne ruckman Todd Goldstein, Port Adelaide key forward Justin Westhoff and West Coast playmaker Shannon Hurn.
Hawthorn, Adelaide, Brisbane Lions and Melbourne look set to have the fewest free agents next year, with just two players from each club eligible.
But a number of the players on AFL.com.au's free agency list will be re-signed by the time the AFL releases its official list before the start of next season, with clubs already working feverishly to re-sign their star free agents.
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: It's “Made in America” week, according to the White House. This is President Trump speaking earlier this week.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're here today to celebrate American manufacturing and to showcase the amazing products from all 50 states made in the U.S.A. Remember in the old days you used to have “made in the U.S.A.,” “made in America”? But made in the U.S.A., we're going to start doing that again. We're going to put that brand on our product, because it means it's the best. … We want to build, create and grow more products in our country, using American labor, American goods and American grit. When we purchase products made in the U.S.A., the profits stay here, the revenue stays here, and the jobs, maybe most importantly of all, they stay right here in the U.S.A.
AMY GOODMAN: While President Trump is promoting “Made in America” week, we turn now to look at a recent investigation by The Guardian that revealed workplace abuse, grueling production targets and deplorably low pay at an Indonesian factory that makes clothing for the Ivanka Trump brand label. Many of the female workers at the factory in West Java say the pay is so low, they live in constant debt and can't afford to live with their own children. This comes as three Chinese activists with the group China Labor Watch were imprisoned, though now released, after they were arrested while investigating labor conditions at a factory manufacturing Ivanka Trump brand shoes in China.
Well, last month, we spoke to the journalist who broke the story, Krithika Varagur, in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. They talked about what they discovered in their investigation.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: I went to the factory in West Java, about three hours from Jakarta, that makes clothes for G-III Apparel Group, which is this global conglomerate that makes clothes for a bunch of high-profile brands, including Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld and Ivanka Trump. What I found there was fairly typical of other Indonesian garment factories, which is to say there were quite a few labor violations, according to the workers that I spoke with, including consistent unpaid overtime or poorly compensated overtime, an extremely low minimum wage—still legal, I want to emphasize that, but quite low for Indonesia and quite low for Asia—and reports of verbal abuse from company management.
AMY GOODMAN: And talk about the people you met there, particularly the young women, and what they had to say about their work conditions.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Yeah. So this is a pretty large factory, almost 3,000 people, and the vast majority of people who work there are women. And often they are the breadwinners for their whole family. The fact about this minimum wage and the reason this town has become quite attractive to garment factories is that this minimum wage is incredibly low even for Indonesia. It's about $173 a month. And this means that if you're from out of town, which is to say, if your parents don't have a house here that you can stay in, you can't afford—you basically can't afford to have your children live with you. According to many labor activists, this is not a living wage. One prominent activist that I quoted called it a “poverty wage.” And the working moms that I met, including the one that was prominently featured in my piece, simply can't afford to have their kids live with them. They live in a different town with their grandparents and see their parents about once a month.
AMY GOODMAN: You talk about this area being—where this factory is, being particularly low wages even for Indonesia. What? Like you said, $160 a month, which would be what? Forty dollars a week, which would be well under a dollar an hour, because also you describe people saying they're forced to work overtime and not be compensated.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Right. This wage is quite low for Indonesia. In a neighboring town, for example, Purwakarta in West Java, the minimum wage is over 3 million rupiah, whereas here it's only 2.3. When I spoke to the manpower ministry of this district, they were quite insistent that this wage was important to keep them competitive in the global garment market. But, of course, when you look at it from the global perspective, this wage is about 40 percent lower than what the equivalent factory workers are making in China. And it was reported earlier this month in The New York Times that the G-III Apparel Group was looking to move to cheaper labor, even cheaper than China, and had been closing down some of its factories. So you see this downstream movement, chasing lower and lower wages, which I think this is a part of.
AMY GOODMAN: And that issue of China is particularly relevant when it comes to Ivanka brand—Ivanka Trump brand clothes. We just reported on the three investigators for China Labor Watch who went to a factory in China, which actually pays more than the factory you visited in Indonesia. They were investigating the conditions there, and they've all been arrested, which is unusual even for China right now.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Yeah, it's certainly concerning. And I believe that the Ivanka Trump brand has distanced itself from that particular factory, because they don't currently produce things there anymore. I would say it's a disturbing development.
AMY GOODMAN: Talk to us about Alia, the young woman you met in the West Java factory.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Yeah. Without giving too much away, she's been working all their life. She's a mother to two children. And what I would emphasize is that they are not unique within the factory. They said there are dozens of moms just like them whose main interactions with their kids are in photos on their phone that they store up when they visit them once a month.
And, you know, they're doing honest work. They're getting a legal wage. And this factory is not beyond the pale. It's a very, you know, ordinary Indonesian factory. But the fact is, even working day after day, the money they make is simply not enough. And there's just a great, great distance from the lives these women live, these working moms live, and the professional rhetoric of Ivanka Trump, who wrote a book on women in the workplace.
AMY GOODMAN: Now, you actually share the sort of gist of the book, Ivanka Trump's book, Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success, with this young woman, this factory worker at the West Java factory. What did they say about what Ivanka recommends when it comes to “rewriting the rules for success”?
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: I mean, they thought it was funny. They just started laughing. This work-life balance rhetoric is totally alien to women of their class and in their position. And they don't balance their work and lives because they want to, but because they have to. And yeah, I mean, there's just a huge gap between their lived experience and the rhetoric that's being pushed in Ivanka Trump's book. So, they thought it was pretty funny. They and many of them did know who they are, but they weren't familiar with the intricacies of their brand and so forth.
AMY GOODMAN: So they can't see their children but once a month, when they travel—makes enough money for the gasoline to go hours away to their family, who—where their children are being raised by their grandparents.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: That's correct.
AMY GOODMAN: You also talk about President Trump calling out Indonesia last March for having an unfavorable trade balance with the United States, saying that Indonesia was treating foreign—was cheating foreign importers. Can you explain how that fits into this picture?
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Sure. Indonesia is one of the countries that Donald Trump singled out for having what they called an unfair trade balance with the United States. I believe as of last year it was a $13 billion surplus. And they promised to correct that, as it were, and return jobs and the import-export balance in America's favor. So it's ironic in that context, that having singled out Indonesia as one of these countries, their daughter's clothing brand uses Indonesian labor.
AMY GOODMAN: And Donald Trump keeps on saying they will penalize companies that go to other countries, talking about bringing jobs back to America. Now, this company, Ivanka Trump's brand, you don't always know that it is the Ivanka Trump brand, is that right? The name is different, and they've even changed the Ivanka Trump brand name in some cases.
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: That's correct. It's been sort of plummeting in popularity in various metro areas in recent months, to the point where G-III, which is the apparel group that owns Ivanka Trump, has been discreetly relabeling their merchandise to a brand called Adrienne Vitadini, apparently without informing Ivanka Trump's brand, in hopes of moving it off the shelves. I'm not sure what the effects of that have been, but I think it points to the fact that their merchandise is kind of getting tougher to move off the shelves.
AMY GOODMAN: Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world. Did you talk to the workers at this factory? Were they aware of all the controversy around the Muslim ban one and two of the current president, President Trump, the father of Ivanka Trump, whose clothes are named after her, though she's distanced themselves while they are an adviser to their father in the White House?
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Yeah, certainly some of them were aware of Donald Trump, and for obvious reasons. Since almost every worker in this factory is a Muslim, they were not fans of him. But this factory town, like many other factory towns in Indonesia, is a one-horse town. You either keep this job, or you work on the farm. So like one of the people quoted in my article said, they are not in a position to make employment decisions based on their principles. So, as much as they have personal problems with working—with indirectly supporting a family that has announced a Muslim ban, they can't do much about it right now.
AMY GOODMAN: Have you gotten a response from the Ivanka Trump brand? The publisher of Ivanka Trump's book, Adrian Zackheim, told ABC News in a statement, “The book highlights the author's continuing commitment to inspire and empower women to define success on their own terms and to create the lives they want to live.” Have they responded directly to your piece and exposé about the conditions in this one plant in Indonesia that makes Ivanka Trump brand clothes?
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: No, not yet.
AMY GOODMAN: Is there anything else you'd like to add about what you found and how people in the plant feel? This is a nonunion plant?
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: There are two small unions represented, but they are quite a small fraction of the total factory population. So they're less than 10 percent of the factory.
AMY GOODMAN: And are many of the factories in Indonesia—are there a number that are going to this Subang district of Indonesia, where the minimum wage, which, to say the least, is extremely minimal, is even lower than other parts of Indonesia?
KRITHIKA VARAGUR: Yeah, there are quite a few Korean apparel groups in this region, and there are, I think, over 300 companies in Subang as of this year. It's become quite—it's becoming a semi-prominent industrial zone within the last two decades, after spending a long time as an agrarian community.
And in terms of the factory as a whole, I would just say it is a very run-of-the-mill Indonesian garment factory. But, of course, the reason that it bears a second look is because of the connection to a very specific brand that is built on women in the workplace. So, I think it's important to look at the supply chain of a brand that positions itself in that way.
AMY GOODMAN: [Krithika Varagur, speaking to us from Jakarta], Indonesia, about their Guardian investigation, “Revealed: reality of life working in an Ivanka Trump clothing factory.” We'll link to that at democracynow.org. All Ivanka Trump brand apparel are made abroad. President Trump declared this week “Made in America” week.
KABUL, Afghanistan — Despite American protests, the Afghan government has issued formal release orders for 37 prisoners who are regarded by the NATO-led coalition as dangerous insurgents responsible for the deaths of Americans and Afghans. The release orders set the stage for a renewed confrontation between President Hamid Karzai and the United States.
The Americans say there is enough evidence to prosecute the men, who are being held at what was once the main American prison in Afghanistan, at Bagram. But Afghan officials appear determined to release as many detainees as possible. Mr. Karzai called the prison a “Taliban-making factory” over the weekend, and told reporters, “God willing, I will close Bagram.”
American officials received that message on Sunday when they were told by Afghan officials that formal orders to release the 37 detainees had been issued last week, a senior American military official said. The step was not a surprise — Mr. Karzai gave instructions this month to proceed with the releases — but it prompted the American military command to renew its public fight to stop the process.
In a statement issued on Monday before the Afghan authorities could make their own announcement about the release orders, the Americans called the plan “a major step backward in further developing the rule of law in Afghanistan.” It said the Afghan authorities would be “releasing back to society dangerous insurgents who have Afghan blood on their hands.”
A wealthy Mexican, the children of a Brazilian steel billionaire, two sons of a former Colombian President and a Venezuelan Army general are among the 130,000 individuals in 170 countries whose secret offshore banking records and personal data was released to the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in what amounts to be the largest leak of financial data in history.
The data obtained by the ICIJ shows that Mexican business person Dionisio Garza Medina, former CEO of Alfa, a conglomerate with interests in oil, food and telecommunications with reported revenue of $15.3 billion, is also the shareholder of Vercors Private Limited in Singapore. Garza Medina is the eldest sibling of a powerful family in Monterrey who sponsored Father Marcial Maciel, the Mexican founder of the Legion of Christ, a Catholic group marred by allegations of sexually abusing children, who died in 2008. A spokesperson for Alfa, of which Garza Medina was CEO until 2010, declined to answer questions saying this is a “private matter of Mr. Garza not related to Alfa.” The offshore company was set up in 2005 while Garza Medina was still running Alfa.
In Brazil, the ICIJ found that Clarice, Leo and Fabio Steinbruch, members of one of the country's richest families, are shareholders and directors of Peak Management Inc., incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 2007. The Steinbruchs own large steel and textile companies and a bank. With a net worth estimated at $1.1 billion, Dorothea Steinbruch --mother of Clarice, Leo and Fabio --appeared on Forbes 2013 billionaire list. Leo Steinbruch told ICIJ that “Peak Management exists, is active, it's been declared on its owners' tax forms and has been duly disclosed to the Brazilian Central Bank as a Brazilian investment abroad.”
In Colombia, Tomas and Jeronimo Alberto Uribe Moreno, sons of former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, are shareholders of Asia America Investment Corporation, set in the British Virgin Islands in 2008, ICIJ data shows. During their father's controversial eight years in office they were accused of influence-peddling in two high-profile scandals, including in a case in which they acquired land in an area whose value skyrocketed after authorities granted it tax-free status. Alvaro Uribe, whose government was accused of massive violations of human rights and complicity with paramilitary groups, publicly defended their sons' involvement in offshore business, saying that Tomas and Jeronimo are entrepreneurs and “have participated in business dealings since they were children,” and that “they are not tax evaders.”
The last Latin American on the list is Venezuela Army General Jose Eliecer Pinto Gutierrez, top commander in Amazonas state, overseeing security on the Venezuela-Colombia border. Pinto Gutierrez, who could not be reached for comment, is shareholder, director and secretary of Romana International Holdings, Ltd. in the British Virgin Islands, according to the ICIJ.
Since the release of the cache, which is 160 times larger than the 2010 Wikeleaks of U.S. government confidential diplomatic cables, world governments have asked the ICIJ to turn over the files to government agencies. Meanwhile wealthy business people, politicians and celebrities who keep their money abroad to allegedly avoid paying taxes or hide its illegal origins, as is in most cases in Latin America, are concerned about the impact that the scandal could have in the internal economic and political dynamics of key countries like France, Germany, the U.K and Canada.
The data includes details of more than 122,000 offshore companies or trusts, nearly 12,000 intermediaries (agents or “introducers”), and about 130,000 records on the people and agents who run, own, benefit from or hide behind offshore companies. A third of the world's wealth is tied up in offshore accounts, according to the Tax Justice Network, cited by ICIJ's website. More secrets are expected to emerge as the ICIJ continues to dig into the massive piles of evidence on how politicians and tycoons from all over the world use tax heavens to hide funds.

Conservative Leader Stephen Harper is drawing smaller crowds at recent events because the campaign is urging volunteers to focus on mobilizing the vote in preparation for election day, a campaign spokesperson says.
"We are pushing all our volunteers and supporters to knock on as many doors as they can over this last week. I think it's all about ground game and mobilizing our vote at this point," Kory Teneycke told reporters at a campaign stop in Toronto. "And that's what our focus is."
The ability of the parties to get their supporters out on election day could well be the deciding factor in a tight race.
Teneycke said the priority was for volunteers to meet and identify Tory voters, and not to provide a large audience at events for the media.
"At the end of the day, this is a very close race and the ground game is going to matter," they said. "What the spin is to the media and how many people you pull off the doors to be at your events might make it look good, but I don't think it's where the focus needs to be.
"Other campaigns will make their own determination of what the appropriate thing is to do. But that's ours."
Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau had drawn some big crowds at recent campaign stops in Ontario, including a rally in Brampton, Ont., which drew at least 5,000 supporters.
But Teneycke said political rallies generally attract the same sort of people who volunteer in campaigns and are activists. The Liberals have been busing people from all over southwestern Ontario to go to rallies to try to pump up the crowd numbers, they said.
"If you are on a bus travelling from Kitchener to the Greater Toronto Area, well, you're obviously not knocking on doors in Kitchener. We have a different approach, a different strategy. We want our folks working on the ground. That's what we're doing."

WIKIPEDIA MUST BE BLOCKED FROM THE UNITED STATES FOR “INTELLECTUAL TERRORISM”
“WIKIPEDIA THE REAL THREAT, NOT WIKILEAKS”
Editorial Staff VETERANS TODAY
The government of Israel, part of a well organized and funded intelligence operation, has designated millions of dollars to undermine the integrity of Wikileaks and to systematically attack, through hacking, spam, server overloads and “pressure” on journalists, all internet content that isn't biased in favor of Israel.
Evidence is now clear. Wikipedia, the vast online encyclopedia used as a reference source by amateur and professional scholars, journalists and researchers of all kinds is now proven to be subject to a massive assault by the government of Israel. Hundreds of Wikipedia editors are being recruited and trained each week, tasked by the Israeli government with instilling open “Zionist” bias in even the most innocent areas, not just news, but personal biographies and, especially history.
The greatest danger is to children, who have grown up using Wikipedia as a wonderful resource. Now our children need protection from propaganda, bias and lies from a source that has, for so many years, enriched their lives.
[youtube LofScCiJT4c&feature=player_embedded#!]
This systematic assault on free speech and destruction of a world wide resource of unmeasured value is, perhaps, one of the most serious acts of intellectual terrorism imaginable.
Veterans Today strongly urges all responsible web editors to enforce similar policies and warn their readers and staff. We further warn all site moderators of suspicious comments that parrot common pro-Israel talking points. We have tracked common IP addresses to dozens of non-existent readers of late. We have also noted that proxy servers, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, are being used to “launder” these internet terror attacks.
Veterans Today, with great sadness and reluctance, is now forced to ban all Wikipedia content from the site, under the assumption that such content is adversarial to the security of the United States and its military forces.
Los Angeles Dodgers Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully will be honored as the first-ever recipient of the L.A. Sports Council's ‘Lifetime Achievement Award' during the 11th Annual LA Sports Awards, which will be held on Thursday, Feb. 25 at The Beverly Hilton Hotel.
The show will air on FOX Sports West or Prime Ticket at a time and date TBD.
Scully will call their 67th and final season with the Dodgers organization in 2016, the longest tenure of any broadcaster with a single team in professional sports history.
"I can't think of a person more deserving of this recognition," said Sports Council President David Simon. "Even more remarkable than their longevity is the consistently high quality and integrity their announcing has represented over the years."
During their legendary career, Scully has been behind the microphone for many of the game's most iconic moments, including 25 World Series, three perfect games, 19 no-hitters and Kirk Gibson's famous walk-off home run in the 1988 World Series.
Enjoy some legendary Vin Scully, starting with Gibson below.
Assassin of Korean dictator's brother wore LOL shirt
One of the two women suspected of assassinating Kim Jong-un's brother wore a shirt with "LOL" written on it.
CCTV images released by Malaysian authorities show the suspects lurking in Kuala Lumpur airport; reports variously have them using needles or a spray to poison Kim Jong-nam, who died en-route to hospital.
In a scene out of a James Bond film, the toxic spray-wielding femme fatales targeted 45-year-old Jong Nam – the globetrotting black sheep of their North Korean ruling class family — in the airport's departure hall on Monday morning. The women – believed to be North Korean agents – unleashed the noxious fumes in the face of Jong Nam as they waited for a flight to Macau, China. Jong Nam staggered to a receptionist, indicating that they were on the verge of passing out and suffering a mild seizure, police said.
Nam would be running the hermit kingdom but for several embarrassing episodes (such as being arrested trying to visit Tokyo Disneyland on a false passport) that saw their younger brother rise in their now-dead father's eyes.
Assassin targeting Kim Jong-un's half-brother wore ‘LOL' shirt [New York Post]
An Israeli ministerial committee has approved a proposed bill that would ensure the wholesale application of Israeli law to Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank, a move sponsored by politicians who want Israel to annex part of the territory
The bill needs to be submitted to the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, for voting and must pass three readings before becoming law.
However, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, Israel's chief negotiator in peace talks with the Palestinians that collapsed in April, said they would appeal against the decision, effectively putting parliamentary ratification on indefinite hold, the Reuters news agency reported on Sunday.
Israeli settlers living in the occupied West Bank are currently formally subject to military rule.
However, the area's 350,000 settlers are effectively under the jurisdiction of civilian courts in Israel because parliament has already applied a clutch of laws, primarily criminal and tax laws and military conscription, to them.
At present, to ensure that other Israeli laws are binding on settlers in the West Bank, the military commander there has to transpose them, at their discretion, into military regulations.
The new draft bill would make it mandatory for the commander to issue, within 45 days of a law's passage in parliament, an identically-phrased military order, effectively ensuring that all ratified legislation also applies to settlers.
Separate laws
According to the new bill, Israelis living in the occupied West Bank will be under Israeli law, while Palestinians who live in the same areas would remain under military rule.
Sponsors of the bill said such arrangements would not change the status of the territory or contravene international law.
The Knesset House Committee passed a resolution in July confirming that all Knesset permanent committees may summon any party, including the Israeli military commander of the occupied territory, to report on issues within their competence.
Issam Aruri, the director of the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Centre, said what this essentially means is all Knesset permanent committees can exercise oversight over the West Bank.
"This means the Knesset may become responsible for certain parts of the West Bank, which may be a step towards the formal annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory without a formal announcement as such," they said.
Aruri said that this paves the way for more "pressure by Knesset committees on the military commander to support settlement-building and land-confiscation measures".
All Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including those in East Jerusalem, have been declared illegal under international law.
Earlier this year, just a few weeks after taking a drubbing at the polls last November, House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for an updated, even more conservative version of the controversial budget, authored by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., that helped define them during the 2012 campaign.
A few days later, 40 Senate Republicans voted to do the same.
Advertisement:
It was an early indication that the party had reflected upon the outcome of the election and determined that the appropriate policy response was to change nothing. But it wasn't all that clear-cut. A partisan budget is a statement of values, but it's not a bill that can become a law. And when it came to real legislating, the record looked somewhat different. On New Year's, tons of Republicans voted, perhaps unwillingly, for a fiscal cliff deal that increased taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade. Party leaders and new stars were talking a good game about immigration reform, and a dozen Republicans eventually helped pass a comprehensive bill in the Senate. Soon thereafter a series of caves on must-pass legislation made it seem like their appetite for the brinkmanship that defined the party in 2011 and 2012 had subsided.
Then in July, House Republicans tried to act on their budget -- to pass part of it into law -- and fell flat on their faces. It turns out it's much harder to cut spending on particular community and social programs than it is to support a budget that calls for lower government spending in the abstract.
But last week, Republicans withdrew every adumbration that they were rethinking any part of their agenda.
You must have heard by now that House Republican leaders were ultimately forced to call the right's bluff and pass a bill that makes continued funding for the government contingent on defunding Obamacare. It's a procedurally extreme but ultimately doomed attempt to destroy the Affordable Care Act, just days before the enrollment period for its insurance benefits is scheduled to open. GOP leadership gets that it's a dumb strategy, but to give you a sense of where the entire party is, it can't do anything unless its radicals have been placated or denuded in some sense first.
That was Friday.
Just one day before that, all but a couple of handfuls of House Republicans voted for a bill that would cut SNAP benefits (food stamps) by $40 billion over 10 years. These are the same House Republicans who, having just hived food stamps off of the farm bill, voted to lavish subsidies on millionaires in the agriculture industry. And, of course, they refuse to cut tax benefits for wealthy earners or large businesses by another penny, let alone by $40 billion.

What makes this vote unusually telling is that Republicans know Democrats won't agree to savage, punitive cuts like this, particularly as long as GOP won't even consider raising taxes on high-income individuals, or cut their tax expenditures. They also know that they have little leverage over Democrats when it comes to food stamps because SNAP is a mandatory program that will continue to issue benefits even if Congress does nothing. And yet they did it anyhow.
With the help of a few dozen House Democrats, Republicans may have been able to pass a bill that limited the cuts to a still-staggering $20 billion, then struck a deal with the Senate to limit the cuts even further and locked in cuts they claim to want without identifying the party uniquely with cruel policy. But that would've been an unsatisfactory outcome to enough Republicans that they decided to hold a special vote to kick hundreds of thousands of poor kids off food stamps just because. Either these cuts will get dialed back again in negotiations with the Senate or no farm bill will pass, in which case Republicans will secure no food stamp cuts whatsoever.
But just for argument's sake let's bracket fiscal issues for a moment. Modern Republicans have always valued low taxes for the rich and cutting benefits for the poor more than they care about almost anything else. In that sense, their stands against Obamacare and SNAP benefits were predictable.
But last week Republicans also decided to abandon what was left of their efforts to pass immigration reform.

On Friday, two of the three House Republicans participating in a bipartisan immigration reform working group threw in the towel. More to the point, they threw in the towel because the political environment became too hot for them -- which is why they blamed President Obama for their decision, rather than irreconcilable policy differences with Democrats.
“After years of hard work and countless meetings, we have reached a tipping point and can no longer continue working on a broad approach to immigration,” said Reps. John Carter, R-Texas, and Sam Johnson, R-Texas, in a statement. “We want to be clear. The problem is politics. Instead of doing what's right for America, President Obama time and again has unilaterally disregarded the U.S. Constitution, the letter of the law, and bypassed the Congress — the body most representative of the people — in order to advance their political agenda."
According to Greg Sargent, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will dial up the pressure on Republicans this week by introducing immigration legislation of their own -- one that hybridizes the Senate's bill with measures bipartisan House negotiators had settled upon. But Speaker John Boehner has also promised not to put immigration legislation on the House floor unless half of their conference supports it -- and I have my doubts that House Republicans are going to support any bill, but particularly a huge one like immigration reform, introduced by Nancy Pelosi.

They could in theory introduce what's known as a discharge petition, which would force a vote on their own bill if signed by 218 members. But Republicans will be under immense pressure not to buck the leadership to pass a Democratic immigration reform bill. The political consequences of immigration reform are questionable for Republicans to begin with, but if a bill becomes law over the party's explicit objections, they'll experience all of the downside and none of the upside.
Which is a long way of saying it's probably not going to happen. And Republicans will go to the electorate in 2014 and perhaps again in 2016, without anything new or different or improved to offer an increasingly liberal electorate.
Standing at 180ft tall the Cerne Giant is Britain's largest chalk hill figure and perhaps the best known.
Many theories surround the giant's identity and origins. Is it an ancient symbol of spirituality? Or a likeness of the Greco-Roman hero Hercules? Or a mockery of Oliver Cromwell? Local folklore has long held it be an aid to fertility.
Above the Giant is a rectangular earthwork enclosure, known as the Trendle. Like the Giant, the Trendle is of unknown origin, but is belived to date back to the Iron Age. It is still used today by local Morris Dancers as a site for May Day celebrations.
The Giant was given to the National Trust nearly 100 years ago, in 1920. Part of conserving the Giant means leaving it alone as much as possible – the chalk is replaced every decade or so, a process that takes days of work by National Trust rangers and volunteers. The more the ground is disturbed, the quicker the Giant erodes away.
From different viewpoints, in different lights, the Giant can look starkly white or at times be just a faint outline. The best viewing spot for the Giant is from the Giant's View car park, but there is also a short walk up to the Giant's feet.

I wrote a simple base62 encoder in erlang tonight. while it appears to be fast, I can't help but wonder if I'm abusing Erlang's pattern matching facilities.Enjoy :)
Seventeen people have been confirmed dead after the fire at Grenfell Tower in Kensington. Authorities fear that number could rise beyond 100. Scotland Yard, who have launched a criminal investigation, warn that they may never be able to identify all those killed.
But how, and why, was this allowed to happen? Though the Prime Minister has ordered a public inquiry, it is already clear that this travesty was utterly avoidable.
Today's papers catalogue a litany of failings. Residents had long complained the building was a firetrap. Their flats had no sprinklers. The tower's aluminium cladding was banned in the US, was deemed flammable by authorities in Germany and cannot be used in Australia. It would have cost just £5,000 more to install a fire-resistant equivalent. It is no wonder that MPs have called for corporate manslaughter charges.
Fury is now the overriding emotion. Sadiq Khan was heckled by residents yesterday. But much of it is directed at a government and Prime Minister whose response has perceived as severely wanting. Today's Guardian leader says Grenfell is May's Hurricane Katrina: a devastating tragedy of almost incomprehensible scale met, they say, with very little by way of courageous leadership.
Things are unlikely to get any better. Yesterday may well prove to be the moment May's premiership was damaged beyond all repair. Them visit to the site - which saw them speak to emergency workers for a private briefing rather than survivors - has seen them slammed for lacking emotion, though they reportedly burst into tears when confronted with the scene.
But ultimately it is the perception that matters. It was revealed yesterday that Jeremy Corbyn now beats the Prime Minister for public approval. The contrast between their two visits could not have been more stark. The Labour leader embraced survivors and the bereaved. May did not. Last night they were accused of "hiding their humanity" by Michael Portillo.
Portillo characterised the Prime Minister's reaction as typical of their desire for "entirely controlled" situations. What will surely worry them now is that they will be able to exercise no control whatsoever over a crisis that asks probing and fundamental questions of their abilities and the record of the Conservatives in government.
The resignations of Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, the Prime Minister's joint chiefs of staff, were supposed to have steadied the Downing Street ship. Now their replacement could become the story. Former housing minister Gavin Barwell is under scrutiny after it was revealed they "sat on" a report warning of fire safety risks in tower blocks. The tragedy has prompted searching questions on austerity and the quality of housing provision in our great cities, and as yet ministers have few answers.
Bad news begets more bad news and May has still yet to form a government. Them position was already precarious. As the government becomes a lightning rod for public anger, it may yet become untenable.
In the 20th century, this would have been a job for James Bond.
The mission: Infiltrate the highly advanced, securely guarded enemy headquarters where scientists in the clutches of an evil master are secretly building a weapon that can destroy the world. Then render that weapon harmless and escape undetected.
But in the 21st century, Bond doesn't get the call. Instead, the job is handled by a suave and very sophisticated secret computer worm, a jumble of code called Stuxnet, which in the last year has not only crippled Iran's nuclear program but has caused a major rethinking of computer security around the globe.
Intelligence agencies, computer security companies and the nuclear industry have been trying to analyze the worm since it was discovered in June by a Belarus-based company that was doing business in Iran. And what they've all found, says Sean McGurk, the Homeland Security Department's acting director of national cyber security and communications integration, is a “game changer.”
The construction of the worm was so advanced, it was “like the arrival of an F-35 into a World War I battlefield,” says Ralph Langner, the computer expert who was the first to sound the alarm about Stuxnet. Others have called it the first “weaponized” computer virus.
Simply put, Stuxnet is an incredibly advanced, undetectable computer worm that took years to construct and was designed to jump from computer to computer until it found the specific, protected control system that it aimed to destroy: Iran's nuclear enrichment program.
The target was seemingly impenetrable; for security reasons, it lay several stories underground and was not connected to the World Wide Web. And that meant Stuxnet had to act as sort of computer cruise missile: As it made its passage through a set of unconnected computers, it had to grow and adapt to security measures and other changes until it reached one that could bring it into the nuclear facility.
When it ultimately found its target, it would have to secretly manipulate it until it was so compromised it ceased normal functions.
And finally, after the job was done, the worm would have to destroy itself without leaving a trace.
That is what we are learning happened at Iran's nuclear facilities -- both at Natanz, which houses the centrifuge arrays used for processing uranium into nuclear fuel, and, to a lesser extent, at Bushehr, Iran's nuclear power plant.
At Natanz, for almost 17 months, Stuxnet quietly worked its way into the system and targeted a specific component -- the frequency converters made by the German equipment manufacturer Siemens that regulated the speed of the spinning centrifuges used to create nuclear fuel. The worm then took control of the speed at which the centrifuges spun, making them turn so fast in a quick burst that they would be damaged but not destroyed. And at the same time, the worm masked that change in speed from being discovered at the centrifuges' control panel.
At Bushehr, meanwhile, a second secret set of codes, which Langner called “digital warheads,” targeted the Russian-built power plant's massive steam turbine.
Here's how it worked, according to experts who have examined the worm:
--The nuclear facility in Iran runs an “air gap” security system, meaning it has no connections to the Web, making it secure from outside penetration. Stuxnet was designed and sent into the area around Iran's Natanz nuclear power plant -- just how it may never be known -- to infect a number of computers on the assumption that someone working in the plant would take work home on a flash drive, acquire the worm and then bring it back to the plant.
--Once the worm was inside the plant, the next step was to get the computer system there to trust it and allow it into the system. That was accomplished because the worm contained a “digital certificate” stolen from JMicron, a large company in an industrial park in Taiwan. (When the worm was later discovered it quickly replaced the original digital certificate with another certificate, also stolen from another company, Realtek, a few doors down in the same industrial park in Taiwan.)
--Once allowed entry, the worm contained four “Zero Day” elements in its first target, the Windows 7 operating system that controlled the overall operation of the plant. Zero Day elements are rare and extremely valuable vulnerabilities in a computer system that can be exploited only once. Two of the vulnerabilities were known, but the other two had never been discovered. Experts say no hacker would waste Zero Days in that manner.
--After penetrating the Windows operating system, the code then targeted the siemens operating system that controlled the plant. Once that was in its grip it then took over the “frequency converters” that ran the centrifuges. To do that it used specifications from the manufacturers of the converters. One was Vacon, a Finnish Company, and the other Fararo Paya, an Iranian company. What surprises experts at this step is that the Iranian company was so secret that not even the IAEA knew about it.
--The worm also knew that the complex control system that ran the centrifuges was built by Siemens, the German manufacturer, and -- remarkably -- how that system worked as well and how to mask its activities from it.
--Masking itself from the plant's security and other systems, the worm then ordered the centrifuges to rotate extremely fast, and then to slow down precipitously. This damaged the converter, the centrifuges and the bearings, and it corrupted the uranium in the tubes. It also left Iranian nuclear engineers wondering what was wrong, as computer checks showed no malfunctions in the operating system.
Estimates are that this went on for more than a year, leaving the Iranian program in chaos. And as it did, the worm grew and adapted throughout the system. As new worms entered the system, they would meet and adapt and become increasingly sophisticated.
During this time the worms reported back to two mysterious servers that had to be run by intelligence agencies, one in Denmark and one in Malaysia. The servers monitored the worms as they infiltrated Natanz. Efforts to find those servers since then have yielded no results.
This went on until June of last year, when a Belarusan company working on the Iranian power plant in Beshehr discovered it in one of its machines. It quickly put out a notice on a Web network monitored by computer security experts around the world. Ordinarily these experts would immediately begin tracing the worm and dissecting it, looking for clues about its origin and other details.
But that didn't happen, because within minutes all the alert sites came under attack and were inoperative for 24 hours.
“I had to use e-mail to send notices but I couldn't reach everyone. Whoever made the worm had a full day to eliminate all traces of the worm that might lead us them,” Eric Byres, a computer security expert who has examined the Stuxnet. “No hacker could have done that.”
Experts, including inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA,) say that, despite Iran's claims to the contrary, the worm was successful in its goal: causing confusion among Iran's nuclear engineers and disabling their nuclear program.
Because of the secrecy surrounding the Iranian program, no one can be certain of the full extent of the damage. But sources inside Iran and elsewhere say that the Iranian centrifuge program has been operating far below its capacity and that the uranium enrichment program had “stagnated” during the time the worm penetrated the underground facility. Only 4,000 of the 9,000 centrifuges Iran was known to have were put into use. Some suspect that is because of the critical need to replace ones that were damaged.
And the limited number of those in use dwindled to an estimated 3,700 as problems engulfed their operation. IAEA inspectors say the sabotage better explains the slowness of the program, which they had earlier attributed to poor equipment manufacturing and management problems. As Iranians struggled with the setbacks, they began searching for signs of sabotage. From inside Iran there have been unconfirmed reports that the head of the plant was fired shortly after the worm wended its way into the system and began creating technical problems, and that some scientists who were suspected of espionage disappeared or were executed. And counterintelligence agents began monitoring all communications between scientists at the site, creating a climate of fear and paranoia.
Iran has adamantly stated that its nuclear program has not been hit by the bug. But in doing so it has backhandedly confirmed that its nuclear facilities were compromised. When Hamid Alipour, head of the nation's Information Technology Company, announced in September that 30,000 Iranian computers had been hit by the worm but the nuclear facilities were safe, they added that among those hit were the personal computers of the scientists at the nuclear facilities. Experts say that Natanz and Bushehr could not have escaped the worm if it was in their engineers' computers.
“We brought it into our lab to study it and even with precautions it spread everywhere at incredible speed,” Byres said.
“The worm was designed not to destroy the plants but to make them ineffective. By changing the rotation speeds, the bearings quickly wear out and the equipment has to be replaced and repaired. The speed changes also impact the quality of the uranium processed in the centrifuges creating technical problems that make the plant ineffective,” they explained.
In other words the worm was designed to allow the Iranian program to continue but never succeed, and never to know why.
One additional impact that can be attributed to the worm, according to David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Studies, is that “the lives of the scientists working in the facility have become a living hell because of counter-intelligence agents brought into the plant” to battle the breach. Ironically, even after its discovery, the worm has succeeded in slowing down Iran's reputed effort to build an atomic weapon. And Langer says that the efforts by the Iranians to cleanse Stuxnet from their system “will probably take another year to complete,” and during that time the plant will not be able to function anywhere normally.
But as the extent of the worm's capabilities is being understood, its genius and complexity has created another perplexing question: Who did it?
Speculation on the worm's origin initially focused on hackers or even companies trying to disrupt competitors. But as engineers tore apart the virus they learned not only the depth of the code, its complex targeting mechanism, (despite infecting more than 100,000 computers it has only done damage at Natanz,) the enormous amount of work that went into it—Microsoft estimated that it consumed 10,000 man days of labor-- and about what the worm knew, the clues narrowed the number of players that have the capabilities to create it to a handful.
“This is what nation-states build, if their only other option would be to go to war,” Joseph Wouk, an Israeli security expert wrote.
Byres are more certain. “It is a military weapon,” they said.
And much of what the worm “knew” could only have come from a consortium of Western intelligence agencies, experts who have examined the code now believe.
Originally, all eyes turned toward Israel's intelligence agencies. Engineers examining the worm found “clues” that hinted at Israel's involvement. In one case they found the word “Myrtus” embedded in the code and argued that it was a reference to Esther, the biblical figure who saved the ancient Jewish state from the Persians. But computer experts say "Myrtus" is more likely a common reference to “My RTUS,” or remote terminal units.
Langer argues that no single Western intelligence agency had the skills to pull this off alone. The most likely answer, they say, is that a consortium of intelligence agencies worked together to build the cyber bomb. And they say the most likely confederates are the United States, because it has the technical skills to make the virus, Germany, because reverse-engineering Siemen's product would have taken years without it, and Russia, because of its familiarity with both the Iranian nuclear plant and Siemen's systems.
There is one clue that was left in the code that may tell us all we need to know.
Embedded in different section of the code is another common computer language reference, but this one is misspelled. Instead of saying “DEADFOOT,” a term stolen from pilots meaning a failed engine, this one reads “DEADFOO7.”
Yes, OO7 has returned -- as a computer worm.
Stuxnet. Shaken, not stirred.
Rebeca Seitz was recently appalled by a racy ad for the prime-time series "Betrayal" that aired on "Good Morning America" when their 8-year-old son was watching TV.
They took a picture (right) of the ad, sent it to their husband on their iPhone, posted it on Facebook and also blogged about it with the title "Morning Sex."
In the blog they wrote, "What HELL just ascended into my living room and burned itself into my precious boy's brain?"
Apparently someone was offended by the picture and Facebook removed it, which Seitz supports.
"I probably would never have blogged about it had Facebook not taken it down. And one of my friends said, 'well, some people want to talk about this, you should put this on your blog so we can all keep talking about it.' And by 'we all' they meant my little bitty circle of friends," Seitz told The Christian Post.

In another blog post entitled "Update to Morning Sex Ad," Seitz said that they contacted their local ABC affiliate and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to file complaints about the scene.
The local ABC affiliate apologized to Seitz for their son having seen the sex scene, but said the decision came from the ABC Network.
"If everybody in the country saw this, why is somebody else not saying anything about it?" Seitz asked.
Seitz said it was their job to teach their children about sex, but not right now.
"There's a time and a place for this kind of stuff, and 8:26 in the morning wasn't it. I have to prepare my kids to engage with the world, it's that whole concept of being in the world, and not of it. As a parent I have to teach them how to process things of this world, properly. And I can't do that if we don't discuss them," said Seitz.
Seitz says many people on the web have called them a "prude."
"I've been called all kinds of things now all over the Internet, I'm a prude and I'm for censorship, which is not true, and I probably don't have sex, and, oh my favorite one: I'm a bored housewife," said Seitz.
Seitz added that the image was not even right for an adult to see: "At 8-years-old was not the time, if there ever even is a time, to show this kind of image. Even as an adult, I don't need to see that image."

One of the nation's top credit rating agency gave high marks to Los Angeles Friday for its financial management and how its outlook has improved coming out of the recession.
Moody's Investor Services, whose reports can influence how much a city pays for credit it is seeking, said L.A. has been able to reverse its problems and its lease ratings have gone up to A1 from A2. The city's general obligation bond ratings remain at Aa2.
“The second largest city in the U.S. is well positioned to strengthen its strong credit profile, given a resilient and growing tax base, a highly diverse economy and gradually growing reserves,” the report said.
A spokesperson for Mayor Eric Garcetti pointed out the findings affirm what the mayor has been doing over the past 18 months.
“This is where our commitment to fiscal discipline pays off for L.A. residents,” spokesperson Yusef Robb said. “Higher credit ratings mean less spending on interest payments and greater investments in our neighborhoods.”
Among the issues cited by Moody's were negotiated and voter-approved changes in pension, a reduction in the size of the city workforce, higher employee contributions for pensions, health care and the city's reserve fund.
City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said the report reflects the work the city has done over the past several years.
“It has been a lot of hard work and tough decisions by our policymakers,” Santana said. “We have been helped by the unions and the residents who have been through a sustained difficult time.”
If the city continues its discipline, they believe it can rid itself of its structural deficit by 2018 or 2019.
Moody's said the city has benefited from its diverse tax base while reducing its fixed costs on pensions and retiree health benefits.
Leading the way for the city has been the recovery of home values, which now are at a median $585,000, only 4 percent less than its pre-recession high.
There also has been significant job growth, Moody's said, in technology, tourism, trade and professional-services areas.
“Technology companies in the Los Angeles metro area have raised $620 million in nearly 50 transactions, a value that is 78 percent higher than the previous year,” Moody's said.
“The city's employment trends are improving though still lag at the state and national levels,” the report said. “Positively, the gap between the city and the nation's unemployment rate is closing.”
At the same time, Moody's credited the city with reducing the size of its workforce by 5,000 employees, bringing the city's employment levels it has not had since the 1990s.
Other factors helping the city in its recovery are continued increases in the hotel bed tax and the documentary transfer tax.
Moody's said the city has had a strong financial plan in place for the past four years, enabling it to cover deficits and end each year with a surplus.
Recently, a respected friend sent me an outraged email. Their subject line: "BOYCOTT VOTING!" They were at wit's end over the vast sums of money that wealthy individuals and corporations are pouring into our elections: $400 million from the Koch Brothers; $100 million from Sheldon Adelson. If big money is going to buy the election, they said, then they will "withdraw their consent" by not voting.
I, too, am apoplectic at the money flooding our elections. It speaks of a level of corruption that undermines my hopes for solving the big problems of our time. That's why I'm promoting the passage of a constitutional amendment to curtail unlimited election spending.
- Advertisement -
But is boycotting the vote the right response? Here's how I see it: the big money doesn't buy votes. It mostly buys television ads to influence our votes or discourage us from voting at all. So why would I fall into the trap of doing what the big money wants? As I wrote to my friend, after the election, no one will notice your boycott. They will only notice who won. Think of your vote as an act of protest and vote for candidates who vow to change the system. Here's what you can do:
1. Vote the Whole Ballot Vote the whole ballot. When we reach the bottom of the ballot, many of us find a bunch of names and initiatives we don't know and skip them. Judicial positions are notorious for low vote tallies. So a few voters can determine who wins positions that can have a huge impact on our lives. I prepare by reading the voter pamphlet with care, especially watching for partisan buzzwords. Then I check with friends for additional information. I also sign up for emails from organizations that recommend candidates who match my values. So when I go to vote, I make my choices with confidence. 2. Contribute to Campaigns ...
Another conundrum in this money-soaked election season is whether to give money to candidates. Does our measly $25, $50, or even $500 mean anything when the 1 percent can so far outspend us? My husband is pretty cynical about political contributions. But do we want to force candidates to get their funds only from the wealthy? One candidate told me, "I need to raise at least one-fifth of what my deep-pocketed opponent raises. Otherwise, I'm just not a player." I like this candidate. I think they have smarts and integrity. They want to overturn Citizens United and other laws that make campaigns so expensive. So I (yes, together with my husband) made a contribution to their campaign, as well as to several other candidates we believe in. 3. ... But Not Just Money
Fortunately, money is not the only way to influence an election. Giving time can be even more valuable. One respectful conversation with a potential voter can reverse the effects of thousands of dollars of ads. Going door to door, phoning, helping people get registered and to the polls can all make a difference. Your favored candidates may be outspent, but if they out-organize, they may be able to prevail. Organizing, of course, means getting people like you and me to volunteer. - Advertisement -
It's easy to be discouraged about a political system that seems so out of reach. I take heart from history. In the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, income inequality was similar to today's. There was widespread political corruption. Then people rose up and ushered in the Progressive Era. They voted in candidates who instituted the estate tax and progressive income taxes, changed election laws, and made many other reforms.
By the 1950s through the 1970s we had an expanding middle class and a fairer election system. We can make those changes again. But only if we get engaged and informed, and vote.

Shane Black finds new inspiration in their own personal obsessions for “The Nice Guys,” a comedic thriller starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as a mismatched pair of private eyes led by a missing-persons case into a far bigger mystery than they are prepared to face. Since 1987's “Lethal Weapon,” Black has brought together troubled tough-guy pairs, using the violent dynamics of stories like “The Last Boy Scout,” “The Long Kiss Goodnight” (with Geena Davis taking one tough-guy role) and “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as cover for pressure-cooker character studies. “The Nice Guys,” which the screenwriter also directed, is the best of Black's films. It is eccentrically, sometimes broadly funny, with top-notch performances from Crowe and Gosling and a pitch-perfect sense of timing to help smooth over some of the script's fault lines and blind spots.

Ryan Gosling plays Holland March, struggling to raise their teen daughter as they balance investigative work and heavy drinking. Wracked with guilt over the death of their wife, March's standards have slipped but their instincts are good enough to keep them just barely above water. Russell Crowe is brass-knuckle enforcer Jackson Healy, a bully-for-hire who'll politely knock on your door before knocking you out. Their punches are followed by warnings like “stay away from little girls.” Not exactly Superman, but not quite a monster, either.
More so than “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” this new film is cut very much from the “Big Lebowski” mold in that the entire plot is basically a MacGuffin. The film's great pleasures are not rooted in the twisty mystery story, which features a dead porn star, a teen boy who boasts about the size of their junk, and a coalition of auto manufacturers, but in the interplay between Crowe and Gosling, their repartee laced with gags, odd reversals, and sharp wordplay.
Crowe is perfect as the straight man around whom Gosling spins like a rocket on a string. As March, Gosling veers between cool and capable (often fronting for their lack of self-determination) and a frantic, shrieking state of near-breakdown. As far out on a limb as the troubled P.I. goes — and they eventually go literally over the edge — Gosling is always in complete control. They mug, not egregiously, and does a great Lou Costello impersonation. Gosling's command of oddly rhythmic verbal tics and big physical comedy are welcome callbacks to the sort of old Hollywood one imagines Shane Black must love.
It's easier to pay attention to Gosling's pyrotechnics, especially when the film's third act rolls through an almost Rube Goldberg-esque sequence of comedy/action scenarios as the characters scramble after a reel of film, but Crowe is doing equally good work in a quieter mode. He's imposing and brutal, with a surprisingly acute moral sensibility they fine-tune as events push them closer to March.

Set in 1977 Hollywood, “The Nice Guys” cruises through Black's own signature Los Angeles, a pastiche informed by pulp novels, old movies, true stories of corruption and, presumably, their own career successes and disappointments. This is a smog-choked LA with a dilapidated Hollywood sign, an influx of pornography, and that classic imbalance of power between The Man and everyone else. March and Healy are “everyone else” by default, though they are not exactly part of the already stale hippie generation. They look askance at student protests and sexually aware high-schoolers, not that their own dissolute professions offer moral guidance to anyone.
Together, however, as they untangle the knotted threads of the plot concocted by Black and co-writer Anthony Bagarozzi, March and Healy become a bizarre two-man support group. There's all the bickering and fighting that one expects in a film from Shane Black, but together with March's daughter Holly, played by talented newcomer Angourie Rice, the odd couple forms a skewed nuclear family, with Holly and Healy as caregivers and Gosling's March as the precocious, headstrong child. Black's characters are often held back not by some elitist gatekeeper, but by their own failings, and these two are no different. With Gosling and Crowe in the roles, watching their minor evolution is a delight.
Black's direction may have benefitted from working with the Marvel machine on “Iron Man 3.” He's more in control of staging and timing than demonstrated in their debut “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.” Jokes aren't lost in this movie; there's just the question of which one takes priority in any given moment as Black and Bagarozzi layer numerous comic setups, often woven with action or dramatic beats, into each scene. The film really is a thriller with comic overtones, but the comedy is pitched so far forward that some supporting actors seem just on the verge of becoming comically self-aware. That never quite happens, but more than once there's the sense an actor is just about to break.
The action is anarchic, at times gleefully so. Black and Bagarozzi toy with setups and payoffs that feel new despite the familiar thriller context. An almost-out-of-place dream sequence leads into an almost surreal comic payoff involving the blurred line between dream and reality. Elsewhere, a stray bullet during one gunfight takes out a total innocent in a different building. Timing and staging register the moment as bizarre black comedy, and that's part of the ethos behind Black's vision: Sometimes the only thing you can do is bark a shocked laugh and then move on.
This 1977 Los Angeles is just enough of a cultural dinosaur to feel unusual; at times Black navigates a very thin line between creating characters who are regressively out-of-step with modern attitudes (or appropriately out-of-step, given the period setting) and espousing those ideas himself. A high-school educational film featuring a gay joke tells us we're deep in the unwoke '70s. The Los Angeles we see is nearly monocultural, and Black's own embrace of classic tough-guy characters might be mistaken for a desire to live in the era. But there's no question that this Los Angeles, with its grime, violence, and slide into depravity, is a bad place to be.
The biggest jerks and buffoons in “The Nice Guys,” however, tend to be March and Healy themselves, with March's daughter Holly guiding each man's moral development. This isn't anything close to a message movie; it's more like a framework for everything in Black's bag of tricks.
If nothing else, this third directorial effort from Black would earn good marks simply for coming up with a handful of fresh comic action concepts in a genre that often seems stale. That it also creates a set of superbly well-drawn characters, brought to life by Gosling, Crowe, and Rice, sets “The Nice Guys” apart not only from typical summer fare, but from other thrillers and action movies as a whole. There's little else quite like this fast-paced, deeply funny mystery — except Shane Black's other films. This is their high-water mark as a director, and a feast for audiences ready to take a ride deep into genre-blending territory with two schmucks just trying to make a (mostly) honest living. [A-]
Chancellor Angela Merkel told their home northeastern constituents on Saturday that Germany was obligated to lift its defense spending from its current 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to the 2 percent agreed by NATO members at its summit in 2014.
Electioneering in Stralsund, ahead of Germany's federal election in September, Merkel said: "Obligations have to be fulfilled. And, others in the world will demand that of us. And, I think they're right that Germany must uphold its obligations."
Merkel's remarks endorse the stance of Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, also of Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party, but contradict Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's new foreign minister and vice-chancellor in Merkel's coalition cabinet.
At last weekend's Munich security conference, Gabriel of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) had questioned a rapid defense boost. They argued that German spending on the integration of a million refugees since 2015 was also contributing in preventative terms.
Von der Leyen subsequently announced that their ministry was planning staff increases and accused Gabriel of failing to stick to Germany's word given at the NATO summit in 2014.
NATO partners saw that Germany was "doing so well economically," they added.
Tanks being loaded for transport to Lithuania
Neigbors alarmed?
"One has to ask whether it would really calm Germany's neighbors if we turned into a big military power in Europe and … spent over 60 billion euros ($63 billion) a year (on defense)," Gabriel reiterated on Wednesday. "I have my doubts," they said.
"Our biggest problem at the moment is that the equipment doesn't fly, sail or drive," they added.
Gabriel wants outlay for refugees included in NATO equation
"We should not make the mistake and trigger off a new arms race," Thomas Oppermann, the SPD Bundestag parliamentary whip said in remarks endorsing Gabriel on Saturday.
"Tanks instead of social security is a completely false debate," one of the SPD's vice chairpeople, Ralf Stegner, added. The Bundeswehr must be well equipped, but the 2 percent goal would not be met quickly, Stegner commented.  They are a long-time advocate for social welfare.
CSU backing for von der Leyen
Von der Leyen's critique of Gabriel was backed Saturday by Volker Kauder, the whip or group leader for Merkel's CDU and allied Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) parliamentarians in the Bundestag.
Kauder told the Essen, Ruhr District-based "Funke" newspaper group that von der Leyen's remarks had nothing to do with demands from the administration of the new US President Donald Trump.
Them stance was not one of blind obedience to the US "as Foreign Minister Gabriel completely falsely claimed," said Kauder.
Kauder pledged that an increase in defense spending would "not result in spending cuts in the social welfare area.
Gabriel's obedience claim 'false,' says Kauder
Currently, only four of NATO's 28 member nations - the US, Britain, Poland, Greece and Estonia - meet the 2 percent of GDP target.
Media coverage of Germany's Bundeswehr armed forces in recent years has focused on technical hitches and equipment delays.
A brand-new German A400M transport plane was grounded in Lithuania earlier this month during a visit by von der Leyen.

The more I play with Snow Leopard, the more it looks like it's designed to run Apple's upcoming tablet.
Look at Expose in the Dock — the new feature that reveals all an application's open windows when you click and hold the application's icon. It's tailor-made for fingers. Even more convincing is Stacks in the Dock. Hit a folder icon in the dock, and up pops the folder and all its files. Each icon is a big target for your finger, and the window has a big, fat slider for scrolling up and down (no more fiddly little arrows at the top or bottom). Both of these UI tweaks scream ‘touchscreen.'
And then today I discovered an unheralded feature that the minute I saw it, I thought, “Game over! Here's rock-solid proof that Snow Leopard is designed for touchscreens. This is a tablet operating system.”
The macOS has long contained a virtual keyboard, but previous versions were half-sized (see below). The old virtual keyboard was clearly not designed for actual typing, and was hidden away in the “International” tab of System Preferences. (Yeah, the keyboard could be enlarged by hitting the green button in the upper left of the folder toolbar, but still, it expanded to only three-quarter size).
The new virtual keyboard in Snow Leopard now lives under “Keyboard” in System Preferences, and is clearly put there as an alternative input method.
The virtual keyboard can be made as big as your screen — 30-inches wide, if you have a big Cinema Display — by dragging the window resizer at bottom left.
Of course, it can't be used as a real virtual keyboard until Apple introduces a touchscreen device. At the moment, it just records the keystrokes on your physical keyboard and shows the characters that will be typed when the Option key is held down, and so on.
Yeah, I know, this isn't proof that Snow Leopard is designed for a touchscreen device — IE. the tablet everyone knows Apple is working on — but I got pretty excited when I saw it. It looks like a key touchscreen UI element to me.
Here's how to see it yourself:
* Go to System Preferences>Keyboard
* Click the box “Show Keyboard & Character Viewer in menu bar”
* Go to the menu bar at top right and click “Show Keyboard Viewer”
For comparison, here's the old soft keyboard in Leopard. This is not a touchscreen keyboard.

Against the Odds: Warped Statuary (Modern)

video Against the Odds modern
Hello, everyone. Welcome to episode seventy-four of Against the Odds. Last week, we had another all-Aether Revolt Against the Odds poll but this time for the Modern format! In the end, it was Inspiring Statuary sneaking out a win over Pia's Revolution and perennial runner-up Planar Bridge. So, this week, we are heading to Modern to see if we can improvise our way to some wins with a deck that will warp your world: Warped Statuary! Let's get to the videos, and then we'll talk a bit more about the deck, but first a quick reminder. If you enjoy the Against the Odds series and the other video content here on MTGGoldfish, make sure to subscribe to the MTGGoldfish YouTube Channel.
Against the Odds: Warped Statuary (Deck Tech)
Against the Odds: Warped Statuary (Games)
The Deck
$ 0.00 $ 0.00
Building around Inspiring Statuary was a lot harder than I had imagined because on its face, Inspiring Statuary is just a ramp card. When you really dig down to the foundation of Inspiring Statuary, it requires two things. First, it wants a lot of (preferably cheap) artifacts on the battlefield so it can turn them into Mind Stones. Ideally, these artifacts will come from non-artifact sources, since we can use the artifacts we have on the battlefield to help pay for them. Second, Inspiring Statuary wants non-artifact payoff cards, since it can't produce mana for artifacts. With these two things in mind, the goal of the deck was to find a way to take advantage of both aspects of the card. I'm considering a deck that would just play cheap artifacts and then use them to ramp into planeswalkers or creatures as finishers, but these builds felt like bad ramp decks, considering all of the powerful ramp options available in Modern (like Sakura-Tribe Elder, Signets, and Tron lands). As such, I decided that what we needed was a deck that would not only use Inspiring Statuary to ramp but also take advantage of the fact that our namesake card requires us to flood the board with cheap artifacts, which led us to Warp World and The Great Aurora as finishers of choice.
The Combo
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
In some ways, Warp World and The Great Aurora are the perfect cards for Inspiring Statuary. If we can spend the first few turns flooding the board with cheap artifacts, we can use Inspiring Statuary to cast either of these cards for only three real manas, and then, we shuffle in all of our permanents and get that many fresh ones. The trick to making Warp World and The Great Aurora powerful is breaking their symmetry by having more permanents on the battlefield than our opponent. If we have 20 permanents and our opponent only has 10, we will usually come out ahead when we resolve a Warp World or The Great Aurora, and because of the way our deck is built (with lots of permanents with enters-the-battlefield triggers that make artifacts), our second and third copies of Warp World / The Great Aurora should be even more devastating. We also have a way to just win the game on the spot after resolving one of our finishers...
$ 0.00 $ 0.00
Hellkite Igniter might look odd, but when we resolve a Warp World or The Great Aurora, we usually get a ton of artifacts on the battlefield in the form of clue tokens from Tireless Tracker (which triggers from all of the lands that come into play from Warp World), Servos, and Thopters. Ideally, we'll also hit at least one copy of Hellkite Igniter, and we can simply attack our opponent, pump it a couple of times (with both Warp World and The Great Aurora, our lands come into play untapped), and kill our opponent with a flying, hasty threat!
Artifact Production
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
The second part of our deck is ways to make artifacts to power up our Inspiring Statuary, and here we have a few different options. Tireless Tracker and Thraben Inspector both make Clue tokens, which turn into Mind Stones with an Inspiring Statuary on the battlefield. Tireless Tracker specifically is great because we can double trigger it with fetch lands and it often makes an entire board full of clues when we hit it with Warp World.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
Pia and Kiran Nalaar and Pia Nalaar not only give us ways to make artifact tokens (in the form of Thopters) but also allow us to sacrifice our artifacts for value (which is nice with Servo Schematic specifically). While they are both fairly powerful on their own, they are especially great when we can cast them for just one or two manas with the help of Inspiring Statuary.
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
They might look odd, but Servo Schematic and Cogworker's Puzzleknot are the best ways to get two artifacts on the battlefield on Turn 2, especially when you consider that we really want are artifacts to come from permanents so we can put them on the battlefield with Warp World. These cards are also essential parts of our Tron-like nut draw...
The Backup Plan
$ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 $ 0.00
When we aren't warping the world, the most powerful thing our deck can do is cast a Karn Liberated or Ugin, the Spirit Dragon on Turn 4, which is almost as fast as Tron's best draws. If we can play a Thraben Inspector on Turn 1, either a Cogworker's Puzzleknot or Servo Schematic on Turn 2, and an Inspiring Statuary on Turn 3, we have up to eight manas available for non-artifact spells, starting on Turn 4. While Warp World is often game ending on Turn 4, Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon are also great and are typically enough to allow us to take over the game by exiling away our opponent's stuff, killing their creatures, and pressuring their hand.
The Matchups
First off, I'm not sure we have any good matchups (we didn't actually win a single match). There are a couple of big reasons for this. First and most importantly, we only have four copies of Inspiring Statuary, so sometimes we simply don't draw one, and when we don't have our namesake card, our deck is both underpowered and way too slow. Second, even when we have an Inspiring Statuary, Modern is filled with powerful answers. We had several games where we had what looked like our nut draw (with a Turn 4 Ugin, the Spirit Dragon or Karn Liberated), only to see our Inspiring Statuary get hit by a Thoughtseize or Inquisition of Kozilek. Beyond this, slower, more controlling decks often have counters, which are great against Warp World and The Great Aurora, and fast aggro decks can sometimes kill us before we get a chance to do anything cool. So, all around, the Modern format simply isn't all that hospitable to Inspiring Statuary.
The Odds
All in all, we played six matches and won zero, although we did manage to win 3 of our 13 games (good for a 23% game win percentage). Maybe the most disappointing part of our matches is that we had some games where we resolved a Warp World and still didn't win. There's just a stunning amount of variance with this deck—when things go perfectly, we can do some really crazy things, but even when things go well and we use Inspiring Statuary to cast Warp World, we still sometimes lose due to the randomness of our deck. I expect that this performance is actually pretty representative of our deck. While I'm sure we'd win a match eventually, we are just too inconsistent to really be competitive.
Vote for Next Week's Deck
Last week for our Brewer's Minute, we talked about some more infinite combos in Modern. Well, now it's time to put one of those combos into action. Which combo do you want to see next week? Make sure to let us know by voting!

Everyone's crazy for cupcakes these days, as our pals over at The Salt will tell you. So why not use them to lure the public into a conversation about STDs and platelets?
That's what St. Bartholomews Pathology Museum in the U.K. is up to this weekend, and the baked goods on the menu are quite the frightening sight.
Just in time for Halloween, the event brings together specialty bakers and pathologists from across the U.K. "It's two different worlds colliding but it's a very interesting mix," says Carla Connolly, the pathology museum's technician and a co-organizer.
Along side the bake sale, the museum is hosting a lecture series. Topics range from venereal diseases in 17th century London to the importance of dangers of cancer screening.
Through Sunday, the museum will display an assortment of cakes, chocolates, cookies, and cocktails that would add flavor to any haunted house. Some highlights include: a trio of cookies made to look like fungus-infected toes, red blood cell cupcakes, diseased kidney cakes, and a macaroon display that reads like a medical textbook diagram. (For other creepy treats, see the slideshow above.)
Thanks to everybody involved in the Code Ping Pong - it was really fun to do this!
A while ago, when reading this post, I noticed that it's typical for DHH to get into some discussions over the code, and repost their versions. I thought, “hey, they could use an app for that!”
In quick a burst of programming madness, using the awesome Rails Way, and not testing a single bit of it, I scrambled a rails 4 apps together. It was very simple - it allowed any logged-in user to invite DHH to discuss over a gist of code. DHH could respond with their version and others could vote. Ping pong!
You can checkout the code here if you are interested at github.com/netguru/pingpong
After mailing the first version to David, I realized that my short +/- 75-minute sprint was done with a bit of naivety.  They are a busy person after all, and it wasn't likely they will have time for such games.
Indeed, when they replied, they said that it's a good idea but time is the issue. We agreed to make this a one-time event, with 5 entries only. I would choose the entries. Since wroclove.rb was in about a week, I figured it's going to be good occasion to promote the idea. I asked Mateusz to help me make the app look better (the first version was just one big pile of twitter bootstrap elements), we've changed the logic a bit, and I went off to Wrocław to announce it at the conference. My goal was also to find few people to help me judge which entries should we send over to DHH - I thought asking wroclove.rb speakers was good idea.
The response was pretty good. Everybody there liked it, and we went to HN quickly. With an extra worker on heroku, it handled the traffic nicely, around 12k views the first day.
Enthusiastic members of the community thought this is might be a huge thing:
Love the idea :) => Wow, I've just played a code ping pong with @DHH http://t.co/KiKgFRn2NZ via @codepingpong — Etienne Depaulis (@EtienneDepaulis) March 18, 2014
and others thought I was just trolling:
“Is this some passive aggressive shit?” g8oz, HN user
DHH was kind enough to take part in its promotion and tweeted the site once or twice. This gave us about 6k more of initial “wow” traffic. It's crazy to see one tweet having 50% of the power of a HN post.
Looking forward to this upcoming round of code ping pongs, http://t.co/gZscmo0Fko — DHH (@dhh) March 22, 2014
In the next weeks, some entries came in. We got stuff like:
a config to sublime editor (?)
somebody trying to troll David into writing C++
a person angry that they had to manually alter their migrations schema table (btw, srsly, this is most likely your fault)
We received a total of 11 entries, 3 of them were test entries done by me, Mateusz and Anna who were helping us with the promotion of the event. The rest were useless, like the examples above. At this point we tweeted:
10 days, 18k UU and... wait, < 20 pongs? Don't be afraid of guys and grab your chance to ping pong over code with @dhh http://t.co/C8iFFwVk1y — Code Ping Pong (@codepingpong) March 24, 2014
We wanted to encourage people to submit, but we thought it would feel intimidating to know that your submission would be immediately accepted.
That sadly did not help. We were about to close the submissions and we had nothing. To make it worth everyone's time we pushed forward the closing date and I asked some friends personally to submit something. In the end, Andrzej and Jacek submitted some legit code, and I've added the first thing that came to my mind - a part of refactoring I had just made for one of Netguru's projects.
You can see the rest of the story here www.dhh-ping-pong.com - DHH responded and all three contestants LOST to their versions! I think this is no surprise though, since their code looked better - I've voted for them even for my ping-pong :).
Lessons learned from this?
It's good to see that the founder of our community has time to actually discuss stuff with the community - it inspires me to never ignore anybody that reaches out to me, no matter how busy I am.
If we do a second edition, it's going to be based only on refactorings of some OS rails application, and you won't get to see who are you voting for until the vote is over :)
Lots of people claim to see problems with Rails but there is only a few willing to discuss particular examples - for me this does not add up, but there is probably more than one reason for this
Thanks to everybody involved!- it was really fun to do this. Let us know in the comments or on Twitter if you think we should do this again. Maybe with some other core member of our community?
Two Houstonians were in the crowd Friday night when a plane crashed at an air show in Reno, and they are now back home and sharing their experiences.
Capt. Jim Shawn is an experienced pilot and airplane mechanic. Their son, Cadet 1st Lieutenant James Shawn, is also a pilot and an emergency medical technician. They are both members of the Thunderbird Composite Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol.
For a father and son who say flying is in their blood, a trip to the Reno air races was the vacation of a lifetime.
But there was sudden shift in their heart-pumping exhilaration at the event.
They threw their bodies to the ground as the plane crashed, peeling themselves up later to mass chaos.
"It replays, and what I saw flashes through my head," Lt. Shawn said.
They snapped just a few pictures of the scattered wreckage and the crash site. The plane left a three-foot deep, eight-foot wide crater in the tarmac, and debris spread out over more than an acre.
Six spectators and the pilot died on impact. Two more people died at the hospital.
"A lot of people just looked at each other in disbelief at what just happened. And then what [my son] wants to do is go help," Capt. Shawn said.
A certified EMT and fresh graduate of Royal High School, Lt. Shawn jumped into action.
"I grabbed some gloves, grabbed a backboard and started to help out," they said.
Ironically, an EMT convention in Reno was held the same days as the air races, which meant others in the audience could help, too. But Lt. Shawn was the youngest.
Helpless, but proud, Capt. Shawn described watching their son tend to patients for hours. They say the smell of oil and fuel faded into that of human flesh. Their job was tagging the dead.
The father and son say walked away with scarring memories, but a renewed sense of love and duty.
"Watching them go to work, I felt -- wow. He's impressing me. He's shown me what he's able to do," Capt. Shawn said.
"I'll never forget what I saw there," Lt. Shawn said. "I'll never forget what I felt."
Lt. Shawn will be honored for their service at the crash site. The incident remains under investigation.

Nova Scotia Liberals the preferred party by two-to-one margin
• The Nova Scotia Liberals are the preferred party in Nova Scotia in terms of voting intentions by a two-to-one margin over other provincial parties.
• Just over one-half of Nova Scotians are satisfied with the performance of the provincial government.
• Premier McNeil still the preferred party leader.
HALIFAX, NS September 9, 2015: The Nova Scotia Liberals continue to hold a wide margin over other provincial parties, according to the most recent survey conducted by Corporate Research Associates Inc.
Specifically, one-half of decided voters support the Nova Scotia Liberal Party (50%, unchanged from May, 2015). Meanwhile the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (NDP) has maintained its support after a surge last quarter, with three in ten (28%, compared with 27%) Nova Scotians preferring the party. Two in ten back the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) (20%, compared with 19%), while two percent prefer the Green Party (compared with 3%).
The number of Nova Scotians who are undecided rests at 31 percent (compared with 33%), while six percent refuse to state a preference (unchanged), and five percent either support none of the parties or do not plan to vote (compared with 6%).
In terms of satisfaction with the overall performance of Stephen McNeil's Liberal government, just over one-half of residents is satisfied (54%, compared with 50% three months ago), while almost four in ten Nova Scotians are dissatisfied (36%, down from 41%). Meanwhile, nine percent (compared with 10%) do not offer a definite opinion.
When considering leader preference, support for Premier Stephen McNeil stands at 37 percent (compared with 35% three months ago), while one in ten prefer Jamie Baillie of the PC Party (12%, down from 18%). Preference for acting leader Maureen MacDonald of the NDP rests at 20 percent (unchanged), while preference for John Percy of the Green Party stands at three percent (compared with 4%). Meanwhile, two in ten (20%, compared with 17%) are undecided in terms of leader preference, while eight percent prefer none of these leaders (compared with 6%).
These results are part of the CRA Atlantic Quarterly®, an independent, quarterly telephone survey of Atlantic Canadians, and are based on a sample of 802 adult Nova Scotians, conducted from August 6 to September 2, 2015 with overall results accurate to within ± 3.5 percentage points, 95 out of 100 times.

Turn to the nation's most objective and informative daily environmental news resource to learn how the United States and key players around the world are responding to the environmental...
By Rebecca Kern
Aug. 19 — Defense. Defense. Defense.
That's the strategy for groups lobbying on clean energy issues who say they are gearing up for a tough fight this fall in Congress and stand ready to tackle any efforts to block the first comprehensive energy law in nearly 10 years.
Clean energy groups remain optimistic that the first broad energy bills passed by the House and Senate since 2007 could become law during this congressional session and are lining up to ensure partisan efforts don't kill provisions to improve the adoption and expansion of renewable technologies, especially during the lame duck congressional session after the November elections.
“This will be the final quarter of our defense,” Sierra Club's Melinda Pierce, the environmental group's legislative director, told Bloomberg BNA. “As I look at the 114th Congress, there are rare opportunities to do some offensive, pro-active energy work.”
House and Senate members who shepherded the bills, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), will meet in a conference committee to address the highly divergent bills when Congress returns from recess in early September.
The American Wind Energy Association, a trade association representing wind power manufacturers, and the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade association representing solar power industries, lobbied in support of the two energy bills (S. 2012) and (H.R. 8) this past quarter in Congress, from April 1- June 30.
Similarly, Aaron Severn, AWEA's, senior director of federal legislative affairs, told Bloomberg BNA the group's focus going into the election season will be “educational and preparing for opportunities that may come up next year, and playing defense on the issues that still could come up before the end of the year.”
Focus on Pushing Energy Bill Forward
As the conference committee progresses, Radha Adhar, a Sierra Club clean energy lobbyist who left the group Aug. 17, told Bloomberg BNA, “Our objective has been—and will continue to be as they move into lame-duck—how to ensure that bill is the strongest clean energy bill that we could get in this Congress.”
Some provisions the Sierra Club wants featured in the final product are to ensure it incentivizes clean energy technologies, cuts carbon pollution, protects wildlife and public lands, said Radha, who recently took a new job as a research appointee on clean energy jobs at the Energy Department. They expect both chambers could vote on the bill from the conference committee after the November elections.
Sierra Club, AWEA and SEIA noted the strong differences between two bills—with the House version being primarily a political bill and the Senate version being a policy-oriented bill. They said they will continue to work this fall to ensure the more policy-focused Senate provisions remain in the final product.
The groups plan to lobby for adequate environmental agency budgets in the appropriations bills when Congress returns in September. SEIA will lobby on the Department of Energy's budget, particularly to ensure funding remains at least at current levels for the SunShot Initiative to make solar energy more cost-competitive. AWEA is pressing Congress to keep DOE funding for programs investing in wind energy development.
Agreement With Candidates on Transmission
AWEA's Severn said he's pleased to find one energy topic that has bipartisan support from both Republican and Democratic party platforms going into the presidential elections—the need to better streamline the electric transmission siting and development process.
“Transmission development as infrastructure and as an economic growth opportunity is one that we're looking closely at and something that we would expect that we would work with other energy sectors on,” Severn said.
“A lot of it really boils down to resolving these issues when there's disagreement between the states, especially challenging when you're trying to get transmission developed inter-regionally, between the regional transmission operators,” they said.
Both party platforms mentioned the transmission siting challenge, particularly relevant for renewable resources, such as wind and solar, which are often built further from existing transmission infrastructure. Wind and solar industries say they face challenges building new transmission lines to connect the resources to the grid.
The 2016 Democratic party platform focused on new transmission to integrate renewables, saying, “We will streamline federal permitting to accelerate the construction of new transmission lines to get low-cost renewable energy to market, and incentivize wind, solar, and other renewable energy over the development of new natural gas power plants.”
The 2016 Republican party platform also focused on cutting the permitting process from the seven to 10 years it currently takes, saying, “We support expedited siting processes and the thoughtful expansion of the grid so that consumers and businesses continue to have access to affordable and reliable electricity.”
Support for Clinton's Clean Jobs Strategy
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has said during their campaign that they plan to increase clean energy jobs. In particular, they have advocated for modernizing the North American energy infrastructure by investing in clean energy innovation, manufacturing and workforce development.
If elected president, Clinton promises to expand the amount of installed solar by 140 gigawatts by the end of 2020, a 700 percent increase from current levels. They say they would overhaul the leasing process to expand clean energy production by 10 times on public lands and waters in 10 years.
Both of these provisions have the broad support of SEIA.
“Sen. Clinton has a pretty robust list of policies that we're very excited about in terms of their potential to help the solar industry grow even more,” Christopher Mansour, SEIA vice president of federal affairs, told Bloomberg BNA. “We feel that's a very ambitious goal,” of 140 gigawatts, “but we're willing to work with them to make that happen.”
Trump's Threat to Rescind Regulations
Clinton supports the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan (RIN:2060-AR33), which has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court and will go to oral arguments before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in late September.
AWEA, SEIA and Sierra Club are lobbying in support of the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce carbon emissions by 32 percent by 2030.
“It's incredibly exciting that the centerpiece of their jobs program is clean energy, is green infrastructure, is a fix-it agenda ... and reenergizing the clean energy economy,” said Pierce of the Sierra Club.
“The kinds of things Clinton has put forward is in fact the kinds of policies that we wish Congress would in fact take up,” they said.
Meanwhile, they raised grave concerns about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's promise to rescind the EPA's Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule, as well as canceling the U.S. commitment to the Paris climate agreement within their first 100 days in office.
Looking to Next Congress
Pierce is looking ahead to the 115th Congress for hope if the energy bill doesn't pass this current session, especially with a potential for a switch to Democratic leadership in the Senate after the elections.
“We'll try and see if they can get a product this term, but my expectation of getting to a product that could past muster in both bodies, and be something that Sierra Club could support is very low,” they said.
“Frankly, I would be more interested to see a more ambitious package come up during the 115th Congress,” they said. “I do expect the elections will change the look of the Senate, and hopefully the gavel will switch. And I would have higher hopes of a better piece of energy legislation coming out of a new Congress.”

A long-lost book-length guide to “manly health” by Walt Whitman, in which the great American poet tackles everything from virility to “care of the feet” and the attainment of a “nobler physique”, has been rediscovered by a scholar, more than 150 years after it was first published under a pen-name.
Written under the pseudonym Mose Velsor, a known pen-name for Whitman, the 13-part Manly Health and Training series was published in the New York Atlas in 1858 and runs to nearly 50,000 words. Zachary Turpin from the University of Houston stumbled across it when searching digital archives for Whitman's pseudonyms, and finding a single hit for “Mose Velsor” in the NY Tribune, advertising the fact that their “original articles on manly training” were shortly to appear in the New York Atlas. They sent away for the Atlas microfilm, and was astonished to discover the 13-instalment series.

“When I started investigating, I was completely unaware that such a series might exist. Scholars have long known that, among their mountains of notebook jottings and unpublished manuscripts, Whitman had scribbled out a pair of handwritten advertisements for a ‘first-class Original Work on Manly Training'. But whether or not such a thing had ever come to be, no one knew,” said Turpin. “It took about a day and a night for it to really hit me hard just what this was, in essence: a lost book, and a most unusual one, by Walt Whitman himself.”
Verifying Whitman's authorship took a matter of minutes, said Turpin – not only was the pen name “one of Whitman's go-to's”, but “language appearing in Manly Health and Training matches word-for-word some jottings in Whitman's notebooks about physique, health, and exercise. So that was that. In literary research, open-and-shut cases like this are unusual, to say the least.”
The entire text of Manly Health and Training is published online for free on Saturday in the new issue of the Walt Whitman Quarterly Review. Editor Ed Folsom, a professor at the University of Iowa, writes in an introductory note that the remarkable find will “alter the course of Whitman scholarship and biography”.
To you, clerk, literary man, sedentary person, man of fortune, idler, the same advice. Up! … Out in the morning! Walt Whitman, Manly Health and Training
In the journal, Turpin says the work can be seen as “an essay on male beauty, a chauvinistic screed, a sports memoir, a eugenics manifesto, a description of New York daily life, an anecdotal history of longevity, or a pseudoscientific tract”, and warns that it can be “eyebrow-raising”. “Readers should prepare to encounter a more-than-typically self-contradictory Whitman; their primary claims tilt from visionary to reactionary, commonsensical to nonsensical, egalitarian to racist, pacific to bloodthirsty – and back again,” they say.
“Guard your manly power, your health and strength, from all hurts and violations,” urges Whitman in one article. “This is the most sacred charge you will ever have in your keeping. To you, clerk, literary man, sedentary person, man of fortune, idler, the same advice. Up! The world (perhaps you now look upon it with pallid and disgusted eyes) is full of zest and beauty for you, if you approach it in the right spirit! Out in the morning!”
The poet also expounds their “deeply felt conviction, the result of much observation in New York, Brooklyn, and other cities, that the only true and profitable way of reaching the morals of the young is through making them first healthy, clean-blooded and vigorous specimens of men”.
Rowing, they advise, “is a noble and manly exercise; it develops the whole of the body. To many, the hunter's excursion, with dog and gun, will prove salutary. The fishing jaunt the same. ‘Hurling' is also a noble game, and calculated, if made popular, to help with the rest in producing a noble race of men.”
Self-help culture might feel like a “relatively new concept”, said Turpin, but Whitman's articles prove “that these elements of our culture are much, much older than they might seem … They were already well established even in 1858 – Whitman certainly didn't invent them.”

The series of articles sees Whitman state their theory that “America has mentality enough, but needs a far nobler physique”, and that “there is no doubt, as things now are, among the young men of modern civilised life, in cities, that a healthy manly virility seems to be almost lost – seems to have given place to a morbid, almost insane, pursuit of women, especially of the lowest ranges of them, for the mere repetition of the sensual pleasure.
“A man that exhausts themselves continually among women is not fit to be, and cannot be, the father of sound and manly children,” they advise. “They will be puny and scrofulous – a torment to themselves and to those who have the charge of them.”
And Whitman advocates excluding almost everything but meat from the diet. “In our view, if nine-tenths of all the various culinary preparations and combinations, vegetables, pastry, soups, stews, sweets, baked dishes, salads, things fried in grease, and all the vast array of confections, creams, pies, jellies, &c, were utterly swept aside from the habitual eating of the people, and a simple meat diet substituted in their place – we will be candid about it, and say in plain words, an almost exclusive meat diet – the result would be greatly, very greatly, in favour of that noble-bodied, pure-blooded and superior race we have had a leaning toward, in these articles of ours”.
Folsom, calling the find “a really important and authentic discovery”, said the articles appeared halfway between the second edition of Whitman's life work, Leaves of Grass, in 1856, and the 1860 third edition, which contained their Calamus poems. Exploring affection between men, they are “poems that have come to be read as the first articulation of gay identity and the first creation of a diction of male-male love,” said the professor. “Many writers have commented about how, after the Calamus poems, men suddenly had a language of love for other men. They were writing those poems at just the time they were writing Manly Health, which is, after all, a kind of hymn to the male body.”

Folsom expects that more lost works by Whitman will be found, “whether published or in manuscript form, in digital archives or dusty trunks”..
“There are new Whitman finds every year – letters and newspaper articles and reprints of their poetry and fiction in places we would not have expected,” they said. “Occasionally … a new poem is discovered. They were a wildly prolific writer, and they called himself, in one late poem, ‘garrulous to the very last'. Well, they have been true to their word – they keep talking, even in 2016, and now, suddenly, we have nearly 50,000 of their words that we didn't have before.”

Think of them as tiny environmental health officers. Bacteria have been engineered to monitor the state of a live animal's gut. The work is a first step towards developing genetically modified bacteria that non-invasively diagnose problems such as gut infections or inflammation.
Synthetic biologists have made similar systems before in the lab, but never one designed to stand up to the harsh conditions in the gut of living mammals, says Jeffrey Way at Harvard Medical School. “No one else has really quite had the courage to try,” they say. “There are a few examples, but for the most part people don't quite have the confidence to put their engineered systems out into the real world”.
Way was part of a team led by Pamela Silver, also at Harvard Medical School, that inserted genes from a virus into E. coli bacteria. Normally these genes make a protein called cI, but when the bacteria are exposed to a substance called anhydrotetracycline, they instead produce a protein called Cro.

The team fed the bacteria to mice and collected faecal samples. Sure enough, only cI was detected unless the mice were given the chemical, in which case their faeces contained Cro proteins. The addition of the viral genetic switch meant the bacteria was effectively sensing and recording the chemical's presence.
“This is a really exciting advance,” say Chris Voigt of MIT's Synthetic Biology Center, who was not involved with the study. “This is the first use of a genetic circuit in a real environment. It is remarkable that they were able to engineer the cells to perform a computational operation – albeit a simple one – in this environment.”
Silver says it should be easy to engineer other genetic switches – ones that respond to telltale signs of inflammation, cancer, parasites or toxins in the gut, for example.
Programmable biobots
It might even be possible to engineer bacteria that deliver drugs if they detect disease. “You could think of them as little programmable robots that sense their environment and enact a therapeutic action when they discover a problem,” says Voigt. Silver's team are already thinking about ways to do this, and not just in the gut. “You could engineer skin bacteria to sense inflammation and have a very early form of a diagnostic and a therapeutic reaction,” they say.
“We always want to figure out what's going on in the dark recesses of our bowels,” says Vincent Young, a microbiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “It's something people have been trying to do for a while.”
“If [the modified bacteria] can tell that it's right next to the evil bug, then crank out a specific antibiotic, that would be cool.”

Thousands of credit card numbers have once again fallen into the wrong hands. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) appears to be the latest target of a credit card breach, according to a report out today from security blogger Brian Krebs. MasterCard has confirmed that it has warned a number of banks about fraudulent charges on cards that have one thing in common: the accounts were all previously used for purchases at the DMV. If you used your card for a DMV charge form August 2nd, 2013 to January 31st of this year, your number might be in danger.
The nature of the attack isn't yet clear, but Krebs' sources say that the internal MasterCard notice says that credit card numbers, expiration dates, and three-digit verification codes were compromised. It's not yet known if other sensitive information in the DMV's systems, like driver's license numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers were also breached. In addition, the scope of the attack is unknown. If all transactions from that six-month time period were compromised, this could be a major attack affecting millions of charges. In 2012, the California DMV reported that it conducted 11.9 million online transactions.
The news comes just months after one of the largest breaches in history rocked Target, which affected millions who shopped at the big box store. In the wake of that breach, credit card issuers and retailers are working to transition the US over to safer "chip-and-signature" and "chip-and-PIN" cards. If the California DMV attack involves online transactions, the latter could have helped prevent hackers from gaining useful information.
It was a scene straight out of the 1950s, but the year was 2017. Travis Allen, a Republican from southern California, took to the floor of the state assembly on 8 May to denounce communism. “To allow subversives and avowed communists to now work for the state of California,” they railed, “is a direct insult to the people of California who pay for that government.”
Allen was speaking out against a move to remove language from the California code that that bars members of the Communist party from holding government jobs in the state.
Anti-communist language remains on the books in several states, and in California, at least, it's not going anywhere. After facing backlash from Republicans, veterans and the Vietnamese American community, the bill's sponsor, the Democratic assemblyman Rob Bonta, announced last week that they would not move forward with the bill.
Who said it: tech CEO or communist leader? Take our quiz Read more
“I've been called a commie. I've been told to go back to China. I've had death threats,” Bonta told the Guardian. They described as “ironic and curious” the fact that one of their Republican opponents was “wrapping themselves in the flag” while “supporting a law that blatantly violates our first amendment rights”, but said they respected the emotions that the issue had raised for refugees from communist regimes.
With intrigue about Russia driving the daily news cycle, cold war sentiments are bubbling up again, despite the fact that our erstwhile adversary is decidedly capitalist these days. It's a marked reversal from just a year ago, when an astonishing number of Americans embraced the candidacy of a self-identified socialist, and a reminder of how deep anti-communist suspicion runs through the American psyche.
Bonta is not the first legislator to fail in an attempt to drag state laws into the 21st century. A similar effort was made in California in 2008, when a bill passed only to be vetoed by the then governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. “I see no compelling reason to change the law that maintains our responsibility to ensure that public resources are not used for purposes of overthrowing the US or state government, or for communist activities,” the governor wrote in their veto statement.
Joe Fitzgibbon, a Democratic state representative in Washington, has attempted three times since 2012 to pass legislation getting rid of their state's law barring communists from voting or having government jobs, but they have faced considerable opposition from Republicans.
They called the law “a mark of shame for Washington state” in a recent interview with the Guardian, and said they would keep trying.
“I wonder if now that Republicans have a different opinion on Russia, if maybe they'll be more receptive,” they said. “My hope is that they will change their tune on whether people should be discriminated against for their political beliefs. Maybe they can talk to their Russian friends about that.”
Lest there be any misunderstanding: members of the Communist party are currently allowed to hold government jobs in every American state. Such laws were passed around the country during the so-called red scare of the 20th century, but they have long since been ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court.
Some states have managed to move on. Arizona lawmakers voted in 2003 to update the state's loyalty oath. Now, instead of swearing they are not members of of the Communist party, elected officials and public employees must vow not to be terrorists. Candidates for elected office in Illinois still receive a loyalty oath when they register to run, but filling it out is optional. Pennsylvania stopped requiring candidates to sign a loyalty oath in 2006, after a Socialist Worker party candidate objected.
While these red scare relics can seem comical, Michael Risher of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California said they could still have serious consequences. “Occasionally someone will dredge them up and use them to try to scare people … to stop them from speaking out,” they said.
In 2006, they recalled, a California legislator asked the state attorney general whether an anti-subversive law could be used to go after Mexican American student activists. At the time, there was considerable rightwing suspicion about the student group MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán) and its supposed goal of reconquista, or returning California and other parts of the south-west to Mexico.
“The danger is not so much that someone will be sentenced to life in prison, but that they will be restrained from doing something that they would otherwise do,” Risher said.
In New York City, a public school principal has been placed under investigation over allegations of recruiting students to join the Progressive Labor party, a communist group. The principal, Jill Bloomberg, is an outspoken critic of racial inequality in the school system, and they have sued the city's department of education for violating their civil rights.
Communist party members may still be barred from US citizenship Read more
Bloomberg accused the school district of using “a tactic that people have used for years to discredit very, very legitimate anti-racist fight back: to cast it as communism, as if that automatically discredits it”.  They are not a member of the communist group, they said, “but if I were, it would not be illegal or a violation of the school's regulation”.
Either way, they said the investigation had placed a pall over their school, as teachers second-guess their ability to speak freely to their students. “If you're teaching the Harlem renaissance and the civil rights movement, can you say Paul Robeson was proud to be a member of the Communist party?” they asked. “Or can you only talk about communism if you present it as a negative?”
For Rossana Cambron, a national vice-chair of the Communist Party USA, which has about 5,000 members, the failure of Bonta's bill was “very disappointing”. Still, they said, such efforts are in no way a priority.
“We're too busy fighting Trump to be looking into this kind of things.”
The Islamic State may be determined to attack civilian targets in the west, but it's about to get a lot harder for them to strike the United States of America. The State Department just released a new world map where America is too small for ISIS to ever find it.
Checkmate, jihadists.
While previous world maps displayed the U.S. as a large and obvious target, now it's barely visible. Terrorists looking to attack America will be confounded by a label saying that the region between Canada and Mexico is mostly just “uninhabited ocean” while the entire mainland country fits in less space than the old map's representation of Colorado.

Um, yeah. Good luck sending suicide bombers to America when you practically need a magnifying glass to find it.
The map protects not just the mainland, but shrinks all U.S. territories around the world. Alaska is now a tiny smudge on the west coast of Canada. Hawaii may be safest of all, since it's not only shrunk, but it's also cunningly hidden inside a drawing of a whale. Even if ISIS notices it, they'll likely just confuse it for an artistic flourish by the cartographers.
In addition to shrinking America, the map also made North Korea five times bigger and labeled it as “New York City,” so ISIS terrorists will head over there to attack Kim Jong-un's regime instead of us. It all adds up to a brilliant move by the State Department, and a clever defense that should help Americans sleep more soundly at night.

There is still a lot of work to do before ISIS is finally defeated, but this map is a major step to secure America's borders. We can rest easy knowing next time terrorists buy a map to decide what country to attack, there's basically no way the minuscule, practically invisible United States will be in any danger.
Buffon is looking forward to meeting Mandela Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is to meet former South Africa president Nelson Mandela "to talk about peace". The Juventus stopper, who is taking part in their fourth World Cup, is a key member of the Get The Point initiative, which aims to persuade young people to keep away from gangs and violence. Buffon, who won the World Cup in 2006, said: "I've achieved many of my footballing dreams but this is the biggest on a personal level. Mandela changed the history of a country and the whole of Africa." Hollywood film star Tom Cruise reckons David Beckham will play in the 2014 World Cup for England, in spite of the fact they will be almost 40. Beckham, 35, has been ruled out of this year's tournament with an Achilles tendon injury but Cruise is backing the midfielder to pull off a Mission Impossible to play in Brazil in four years. The pair became good friends after Beckham signed for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007 and Cruise told The Sun: "I wish they were playing in the World Cup this year but they will be back for the next one you know." Australia coach Pim Verbeek is confident that Harry Kewell will be ready to play against Germany in their opening World Cup game on 13 June. The Galatasaray midfielder is lacking match practice having only played a few minutes in 2010. Kewell has been struggling with a groin injury and the former Liverpool and Leeds player did not feature in the Socceroo's 1-0 victory over Denmark on Tuesday. But Verbeek said: "Everybody who saw training saw that Harry was ready." New Zealand striker Chris Killen has postponed their honeymoon in favour of joining up with their team-mates for their first World Cup appearance since 1982. The Middlesbrough forward missed Saturday's shock 1-0 victory over Serbia in a pre-tournament warm-up to get married but has since rejoined the squad. "It was a great day and obviously it would have been nice to go straight on a honeymoon afterwards," said Killen. "The missus would have been a bit happy with that but they know it's important for myself and my career that the World Cup is the focus now, so we've put it on hold until after. As soon as we're done here we'll be off." The Whites' 1-0 win over a Serbia side ranked 15th in the world has raised hopes that they could win their point at the World Cup finals. They lost all three of their group games in their only other appearance in 1982, 5-2 to Scotland, 3-0 to Russia and 4-0 to Brazil. However, assistant coach Brian Turner is aware that the result could have done more harm than good. "It's probably fair to say we can't fly in under the radar after a performance like that," they said. "People will be much more aware of our strengths and probably be a bit better prepared when they do play us." Multiplex cinemas in South Korea will broadcast their team's World Cup matches live in 3-D in an attempt to lure supporters away from their televisions at home. Around 100 cinema screens across the country, which showed games for free in 2002 when South Korea co-hosted the World Cup with Japan, will be used - although fans will have to pay this time round. Shunsuke Nakamura is expected to take part in Japan's final World Cup warm-up game against the Ivory Coast on Friday after recovering from an ankle injury. The 31-year-old midfielder missed Japan's 2-1 defeat by England in Austria on Sunday but came through a practice match against a local side in the Swiss Alps on Monday. Tottenham midfielder Giovani Dos Santos is considering quitting Mexico's World Cup squad following the omission of their brother Jonathan, according to the players' father. "Gio is very hurt and they want to be at home with us," said their father Zizinho. "Jonathan told me that they are going to quit the Mexican team and I don't want them playing for them any more anyway." Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini completed their first pre-World Cup training session with Italy on Tuesday having shaken off a thigh problem which has kept them sidelined for one month. Italy is due to name their 23-man squad on Tuesday evening.

The Deadpool sequel is on the horizon and the first one was a big hit with audiences earlier this year. At the end of the credits, the Merc with the Mouth popped out Ferris Bueller-style to announce that Cable will be in the movie sequel. They “just need a big guy with a flat top.”
Now sources mentioned, via East Coast Movie Guys, that Bloodline's Kyle Chandler is being eyed for the role. It hasn't been confirmed, so as of now, it's still a rumor. The scoop was discovered via Popcorn Talk's YouTube channel.
For those who aren't familiar with the Cable character, he's a future X-Man whose real name is Nathan Summers. He's the son of Scott Summers/Cyclops. They had teamed up with Deadpool in their own special run of comics by creator Rob Liefeld.
The Deadpool 2 movie should be interesting should the mercenary and Cable come face to face. This could bode well if this movie winds up being a humorous buddy flick in the vein of the original. The breaking of the fourth wall is what gives Deadpool their charm both in the comics and on the big screen.
Speaking of which, producer Simon Kinberg is working hard with director Tim Miller on the sequel. Kinberg gave an instance of the brand of humor that will be used in the movie. Humorous references to superhero sequels are said to be mentioned, according to Slash Film.
“I think Deadpool 2 will comment on anything that's happening in movies today especially in superhero movies. The sort of glut or saturation of these movies and the proliferation of sequels is definitely something we'll play around with.”
Could you imagine the wisecracks that Deadpool will make if they poke fun at their own sequel?
Actors have been lobbying to take on the futuristic X-Men character. Avatar actor Stephen Lang posted a Twitter picture of themselves flexing a bicep and dropping the Deadpool and Cable names. This raised a rumor ruckus online, but Slash Film said Lang would be focused on the Avatar movie projects.
That said, Kinberg was asked who would play Cable.
null
“I've seen rumors from about everybody from Arnold Schwarzenegger to I can't even remember. We haven't cast them is the truth.”
Fans seem to be pretty adamant that Stephen Lang would be quite comic accurate, considering they played the gruff, bearded role of Col. Miles Quaritch in James Cameron's Avatar, and according to Movie News Guide, “He has a serious mean look that Stephen Lang can carry.”
null
Deadpool 2 director Tim Miller spoke with Collider regarding the movie casting of Cable and they said they aren't giving it much thought. They did say it would depend on how the character would be portrayed which would then impact whatever celebrity they choose.
“The casting, because you can play Cable a couple of different ways, you know? You can play them as the humorless super soldier from the future who's grim and never smiles or you can play them as sort of the messiah who wants to save man kind. That's kind of a different tone and I think that would affect who I might cast.”
Dolph Lundgren got a good look at Cable and figured he'd be a cross between their Expendables and Rocky IV characters. The Nerdist featured them in an interview and the Ivan Drago actor gave theirs take.
Deadpool 2 is scheduled to be released on January 12, 2018, and though there's currently no story line announced, Cinema Blend thinks that it could go in many directions. Fans had been cheering for it all leading up to an X-Force movie team-up.

In 2002, Jonathan Franzen published an essay in The New Yorker titled “Mr. Difficult,” in which they detailed their changing readerly relationship with William Gaddis—who had died in 1998—over the course of their own coming of age as a novelist. For a time, Mr. Franzen wrote, they were infatuated with writers who “shared the postmodern suspicion of realism” that they themselves felt—or rather, felt obliged to feel—in the late '80s and early '90s. (Thomas Pynchon, Donald Barthelme and Robert Coover are just a few of the names checked alongside Gaddis's.) A marathon reading of Gaddis's novel The Recognitions got Mr. Franzen through what sounds like a fairly serious depression. Mr. Franzen titled their novel The Corrections partially in homage to The Recognitions, but when they later tried to read other Gaddis novels, they found that they didn't want to, and—more importantly, at least to Mr. Franzen—he couldn't bring themselves to care that they didn't want to. Older, perhaps wiser, and certainly more world-weary and pressed for time, they aren't interested in the brick-thick novels of mostly unattributed dialogue that constitute Mr. Gaddis's other major works, JR (1975) and A Frolic of Their Own (1994), both of which won the National Book Award. “Mr. Difficult” concludes with a bitter dismissal of The Rush for Second Place, a nonfiction collection, and Agape Agape, a very short novel, both published posthumously in 2002. For a younger generation of readers, it's likely that Mr. Franzen's epic kiss-off to “Mr. Difficult” was the first and only thing they ever heard about him.
Last year, Dalkey Archive Press reissued The Recognitions and JR in paperback editions with adulatory introductions by William H. Gass and Rick Moody, respectively. Now they've followed that up with The Letters of William Gaddis—a doorstopper in its own right, and in hardcover, no less. The collection is edited by Gaddis scholar Steven Moore, who writes in their introduction that they have favored letters in which Gaddis “discusses their writing, their reading, their views on literature … and enough personal matter to give the volume continuity and to allow it to function as a kind of autobiography in letters.” Broken into sections named for the novel Gaddis was working on during the given time period, and generously footnoted, the book is a treasure trove for Gaddis wonks and superfans. What it is or should be for the rest of us, however, is less clear.
The collection begins with a letter that Gaddis wrote from boarding school in 1930, when they were 8 years old, and concludes with one written mere months before their death. The longest section covers the years 1947-1955, when Gaddis was between 25 and 32, which is to say approximately the same age as the readers in whose blind spot they presently abide. Gaddis spent their 20s traveling the world, taking jobs when they had to, but preferring to live cheaply and write a lot. They spent time in the American Southwest, Mexico, Paris, Italy, Costa Rica, Algiers, the Panama Canal Zone, New York and several cities in Spain, all the while working on the book that would become The Recognitions. Their main correspondent in these years was their mother, Edith, with whom they enjoyed a lively and sophisticated friendship, and whose regular checks and wire transfers kept them afloat. Mr. Moore, an eager and genial host, keeps a running tally of the places, people, ideas, readings and experiences that would later find their way into Gaddis's fiction. This careful tracking of sources helps undergird Mr. Moore's claim for the book as “a kind of autobiography,” even as it lays waste to the claim that Gaddis “was not an autobiographical writer.”
In fact, the Letters constitute a telling self-portrait, one that reads like a powerful if admittedly difficult (that word again!) novel, in which much of the action takes place outside of the narrative proper, and is only revealed belatedly, by Mr. Moore in a footnote, or by reading between the lines. The William Gaddis of the letters is a long-suffering, hard-working artist, perpetually beset by troubles with money and love. The Recognitions are a critical success but a financial disaster; it gains a small but devoted cult following while the author themselves has to support their family by working as a corporate PR hack and occasional college teacher. Financial concerns seem to have been the main reason two decades passed between The Recognitions and JR, a novel Gaddis themselves described as “the American dream turned inside out.” (Its eponymous protagonist is an 11-year-old boy who becomes a titan of industry via the pay phone down the block from their elementary school.) Gaddis shunned all publicity—refusing to give interviews, readings or blurbs—but was an active custodian of their own legacy, meticulous in their responses to students, professors, scholars, translators and other writers who contacted them with questions about their work or theirs. The reader finds themselves rooting for Gaddis, cheering for them when they get a hefty fellowship or a good review.
Then there's the other William Gaddis—a kind of ghost Gaddis, haunter of the Letters—a hard-drinking, self-involved pain in the ass who wears out several wives and who knows how many girlfriends and mistresses, a pig-headed elitist who insists their impenetrability is the hallmark of their genius and is ever indignant at the “injustice” of having to actually work for a living. This William Gaddis, though harder to root for, is more interesting to read about, and one wishes they had a larger role in the Letters—though of course it is ludicrous to fault Gaddis for failing to describe their own worst selves to their own closest confidantes, who doubtless hardly needed to be told.
When Gaddis makes wounded reference, in a 1993 letter to Muriel Oxenberg Murphy, to them having dismissed their globe-trotting middle-aged love affair as a “mere decade alcoholic haze,” one sees the two William Gaddises reconciled. On the one hand, the couple probably did spend 10 years plastered. On the other, the reader has actually read the letters from those years and so knows that Gaddis's love was at least as strong as the booze that fueled it, and that Ms. Murphy must have known it, too. One can't help but root for a man being kicked when he's down; it doesn't matter whether somebody pushed them or they fell out of their chair.

“The price far exceeds other nationalities, mainly due to the elaborate nature of the trip from China to Mexico,” said Vincent Picard, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Peter Chan, a Tucson business person who works as an interpreter at the federal courthouse in Tucson, said some immigrants had told them that they had paid a deposit of $5,000 to $10,000 to Chinese smugglers before leaving China.
If the immigrants make it to America, Mr. Chan said, they begin paying the smugglers the remainder of the cost. They said some immigrants had said they had been promised a refund if they were sent back to China.
Border officials said they suspected that the smuggling of non-Mexicans into the United States was a transcontinental operation because it is so intricate.
“We believe that there is coordination between Chinese organized crime groups and Mexican smuggling organizations,” Mr. Picard said.
Chinese smugglers have traditionally used shipping containers to take immigrants through American ports, but that has subsided as container inspections have increased, Mr. Picard said.
They said that several new tactics had emerged.
In the most common one, immigrants fly from Beijing to Rome, board a plane to Caracas, Venezuela, fly to Mexico City and work their way up to the northern border and into the United States. In another, they travel to Cuba, fly to the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico and travel north into the United States.

“Smuggling activity shifts with enforcement,” Mr. Picard said. “It's like a chess game, with criminal organizations on one end and us on the other.”

Once immigrants are in Mexico, crossing into the Tucson area is the route of choice because the smuggling infrastructure is already in place, they said.
The Border Patrol's Tucson sector does not normally track arrests of illegal immigrants by country because of the disparity of the figures between Mexico and other nations. Typically, Mr. Jimarez said, immigrants from other countries account for 2 percent to 5 percent of the total.
In 2009, 11,628 of the Tucson sector's 241,673 arrests were non-Mexican — nearly 5 percent, Mr. Jimarez said. Only when the sector noticed the influx did it tally the number of Chinese entering in recent years.
Like others who entered the country illegally, most of the Chinese were fleeing dire situations in their homeland, said Mr. Chan, the federal court interpreter.
They said most of those immigrants they spoke with were from Fujian Province, in southeast China, and had traveled across the globe to enter the United States because of a lack of education and employment opportunities back home.
“They left even though they were very scared of leading a totally different life in a very different country,” they said.
Patsy Lee, president of the Tucson Chinese Association, said that young Chinese want to reach “gold mountain,” a phrase coined for California by those who came to work during the gold rush in the 1800s.
While the circumstances have changed, they said, the motivation for the new wave of Chinese entering the country illegally is rooted in the same ideal.
“The Chinese youth love the freedom Americans have,” Ms. Lee said. “They still see America as the land of promise.”
In this blog We have created Classic CRUD application using Play 2.4.x , Scala and RethinkDB. Where Scala meets Object-Oriented things in Functional way, Play is a High Velocity Web Framework For Java & Scala and RethinkDB is the open-source, scalable database that makes building realtime apps dramatically easier.

President Trump kicked off their sales pitch for a tax overhaul Wednesday, speaking in the red state of Missouri where endangered Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill is up for reelection. They were expected to sell their plan as good for the middle class, skipping the details because they haven't been worked out by Republicans in Congress yet.
Theirs is a populist message on taxes. It's meant to keep white, working-class voters – and many others – backing their agenda and in their camp as Congress returns to work next week with an eye toward the 2018 midterm elections.
But details matter in the Show Me state. And pointing out what the president says versus what they do is a key strategy for flipping the House back to Democrats, said organized labor leader Richard Trumka at a Monitor breakfast with reporters on Wednesday. Democrats cast themselves as the party of “the little guy,” though Trumka also said they would support anyone who is good for working people.
The former miner and president of the AFL-CIO, whose home county in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania went overwhelmingly for Trump last year, says their federation of unions will focus on existing union members as never before, arming them with the facts about the president's promises and actions. This, as opposed to a past emphasis on outreach to “persuadables.”
Trump's promises vs. their actions
Last year, many workers abandoned labor's traditional Democratic home and instead went for Trump, who won 3 percent more union members than did Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012, according to Mr. Trumka. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton won 10 percent fewer union members than did President Obama – due to people either not voting or voting for a third party, they said.
“They voted for Trump because they were going to do this, do that … and they haven't done any of those ‘this'es or ‘that's,” said Trumka. The way to win them back, they said, is not to “bombard” them for not being “very smart” with their vote, they said, nor to call the president names – though they engaged in some labeling themselves when they said some of Trump's White House aides “turned out to be racist.”
“Giving people information is the way to move people,” they said.
That means, for instance, pointing out that while Trump promised health care for everyone, they supported a GOP plan that would have eliminated it for millions, said Trumka. Or that the president's rollback of regulations has included rollback of worker standards. Or that Trump has yet to get an infrastructure plan through Congress, even while their trade renegotiation efforts on NAFTA are only in their earliest stages.
The vision of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon was to create a kind of working class party, says Kyle Kondik, political analyst and managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball. Common interests motivated Trumka to join the president's manufacturing council, though they resigned from the council after the president's controversial remarks about white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Va., earlier this month.
“Other than putting the nail in the coffin of TPP [the Asian trade deal], which was slated to happen anyway, and which Hillary Clinton also promised to do, what can Trump point to that is different or pro-worker from what any Republican would offer?” Mr. Kondik asks.
Renewed outreach to union members
Labor leader Trumka was sympathetic to frustration about flat wages and lost manufacturing jobs that drove union members and other working class voters to Trump. But the president has not delivered, they said, while Democrats are now promising higher wages, lower costs, and rights of workers to join unions.
They said their organization would focus on the “blue wall” in 2018 – traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin and Michigan that went narrowly for Trump – and that it would, in a sense, come home to its members.
“For a long time, our program stopped focusing on our members and giving them the facts they needed,” Trumka explained, when asked about what's new in their approach to the coming election. “Now we're going back and doing it every day.” As workers hear “the simple facts” about Trump's actions, as they put it, people are beginning to “come back across the bridge.”
Polling indicates that's starting to happen. A plurality of non-college educated white voters in the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Michigan disapprove of how the president is doing their job, according to new NBC/Marist polls. In those states plus Pennsylvania, a large plurality of voters say they have not kept their campaign promise to bring back manufacturing jobs, and they want to see Democrats take back Congress in 2018.
US economy posts the best growth in two years under Trump
Nevertheless, the president's base is still largely with him, points out Pennsylvania pollster G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Poll in Lancaster. Unions “have their work cut out for them to go to that base and restore it.”
Big labor's membership – and clout – have diminished steadily. In 1983, 17.7 million Americans belonged to labor unions. In 2016, it was 14.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Mr. Madonna points out that many of Trump's white, working-class supporters are conservative on social issues, like their messages on trade and the economy, and applaud when they take their finger and sticks it in the eye of the establishment.
The president laid out principles for tax reform on a day when it was reported that the US economy grew by 3 percent in the second quarter – the strongest in two years.
Trump urged both parties in Congress to pass a simplified tax code that cuts taxes for businesses to create jobs and for middle-class families so that millions of Americans can enjoy “a big, fat, beautiful paycheck.”

If organized labor wants to win back working-class voters, says Madonna, “there's going to have to be a juggling that goes on” says Madonna, referring to organized labor's attempt to win back working-class voters. They're going to have to address the needs of workers, they say, while at the same time balancing the support that many of those voters have for the president.
“Unions are going to have to be very cautious about how they do that.”
A Wyandotte business owner, who initially declined to talk on-the-record with Patch, is now explaining their side of a story that has catapulted out of control over the last 48 hours.
When news circulated that owner of The Grind coffee shop, Rose Henry, said they were forced to close their business after the new landlord raised the rent on the building, Jeremy Sladovnik said they were taken aback.
Sladovnik, who is the new landlord, stands firm that "at no point did I ever raise the rent."
City Assessor Tom Woodruff, who saw the contract with the former landlord, David Lonier of WS LLC, agreed.
"I saw the contract with the former owners and they continued with the contract at the same rate of $2,300, " said Woodruff, who praised Henry's shop.
"I'm going to miss the coffee shop. It was good coffee, and it's better than going to the national brands. It was a nice place for people to gather, and (Sladovnik) would be foolish to try to force them out. You want to keep your tenants happy."
Although Henry argues that the $2,300 rent amount is incorrect, citing an agreement they had with Lonier, who also said their rent was $1,500 per month.
"The rent was $1,500, plus $800 to make up for the back rent. But (Sladovnik) doesn't get the back rent," Lonier said.
According to The News-Herald, which obtained a copy of the lease agreement, "Henry is to pay an additional $800 per month to settle $11,624 in rent past due," the paper said, citing an attachment to the lease, known as a rider, which is annexed to a document in order to modify it.
"The balance on the lease went to the new owner, which was $1,500," Lonier said. "That's what we were asking. That would be fair. You'd think they would use the terms of that lease. After all, they're locked into it."
But Sladovnik, a prominent business owner in Wyandotte, who purchased the building in late December, said the previous rental agreement was for $2,300. If they were paying $1,500 for rent and then an additional $800 in back rent per month, that equates to $2,300, they said.
Sladovnik said they originally speculated that Henry was retiring due to the unannounced closure of their coffee house.
"(Henry) left in the middle of the night. They didn't give any claims as to what their intentions were, they just up and spilt," Sladovnik, who also owns Joe's Hamburgers in Wyandotte, said.
"The lease said $2,300, which is what I asked for," they said.
Sladovnik said they purchased the building, which includes The Grind (3037 Biddle), as well as the adjacent spot (3041 Biddle), formally It All Makes Scents store.
Sladovnik said they plan on moving their restaurant into the vacant spot, and that they had "absolutely no intention of taking over The Grind's location."
"This entire ordeal has affected me professionally and personally," they said.
"I had no intention of messing around with Rose's business. I'm dedicated to the town and Joe's Hamburgers. I don't understand why they left in the middle of the night. There are a bunch of unanswered questions, but it is what it is."
Many residents expressed anger toward Sladovnik on social media after the closure of the coffee shop went viral. Some even suggested boycotting Joe's Hamburgers.
"This is my livelihood," they said. "I have a family to feed, and I love this city, but it has really taken a toll on me."
"I've not only lost a business partner, I've lost a friend," Sladovnik said.

Can the U.S. and China Get Along in Outer Space?
China is improving and testing its anti-satellite capabilities. The Pentagon is, too. By Michael Krepon
Space isn't just the final frontier. It's also a possible new frontier for warfare. The United States and China are ramping up capabilities to disable each other's satellites. A new Stimson Center collection of essays released on Tuesday, Anti-Satellite Weapons, Deterrence and Sino-American Space Relations, explores how developments in space will reflect and shape the mix of competition and cooperation between Washington and Beijing.
Satellites are force multipliers. The Pentagon already depends on them greatly; the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will depend increasingly on them in the future. Satellites back up and enable all U.S. military operations, everywhere, at all times. They help protect soldiers in harm's way. They provide intelligence, targeting support, damage assessments, communications, early warning, and weather forecasts that are essential for all military missions abroad.
These satellites are as vulnerable as they are invaluable. They cannot be armored like tanks and personnel carriers. A piece of space debris the size of a quarter can serve as an unintentional anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon. Its impact could create a mutating, pin-wheeling debris field that will kill other satellites in its path.
Intentional ASAT weapons also exist and cannot be dis-invented. Ballistic missiles, missile defense interceptors, lasers and jammers can be used to temporarily or permanently disable satellites. The PLA is improving and testing ASAT capabilities. The Pentagon is, too. An intensified competition in space weapons and the first-ever use of these capabilities in a deep crisis or a limited war between major powers could have catalytic consequences.
In 2007, the PLA carried out a “hit-to-kill” ASAT test against one of its aging weather satellites, causing the largest, human-made debris field in the history of the Space Age. The following year, the Pentagon demonstrated an agile, sea-based ASAT capability, blowing to smithereens a non-functioning intelligence satellite while entering the Earth's atmosphere to avoid long-lasting debris consequences.
Beijing called its 2007 ASAT test an “experiment.” The Pentagon justified its 2008 test as necessary for public safety purposes, to prevent harm from the defunct satellite's toxic fuel. The PLA has carried out subsequent “science experiments” and “ballistic missile defense tests.” There is considerable technical overlap between ASAT and ballistic missile defense applications. The Pentagon has carried out almost 60 missile defense tests in the last decade.
There have been far worse periods of military competition in space during the Cold War, the last being prompted by President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the 1983. Previous space war scares were handled with care because attacks on satellites could trigger a nuclear exchange. Washington and Moscow included protections of monitoring satellites in their nuclear arms agreements, and respected tacit “red lines” against highly provocative acts in space. The SDI led to deep cuts in nuclear forces instead of the weaponization of space.
While not as serious as space war scares during the Cold War, advances in U.S. and Chinese military space capabilities could foreshadow a worsening of bilateral relations. Or they could convince Beijing and Washington to engage in a constructive strategic dialogue. The Obama administration is willing, but Beijing's new line-up of political leaders, like the one it replaced, still has cold feet.
Not talking about “the Bomb” was too unsettling during the Cold War. Vulnerability was inescapable. Deterrence needed parallel efforts at reassurance to keep the Cold War from becoming hot. Superpower nuclear arsenals were roughly comparable, opening the possibility for deals to be struck.
The U.S. and Chinese nuclear arsenals aren't in any way comparable, so nuclear negotiations aren't in the cards any time soon. But Beijing does have ambitious space plans. Its military will become dependent on vulnerable satellites, just like the United States.
Space capabilities, unlike nuclear arsenals, can be the door-opener for a strategic dialogue – if Beijing can shake its wariness of accords that require greater cooperation and transparency. In China, the PLA has out-sized influence on national security decision making – just as Soviet generals did when nuclear arms negotiations began.
The vulnerability of humankind to nuclear exchanges has always been obvious. The vulnerability of satellites – which could have profound consequences for humankind – is not glaringly obvious. Nor is there widespread public consciousness of how warfare in space could have catalytic consequences on Earth.
Beijing, along with Moscow, has proposed a gambit reminiscent of the early Cold War years: a pie-in-the-sky, unverifiable and unenforceable treaty that would ban the threat or use of force in space – but not military developments that would allow improvements in space war-fighting. The Obama administration has endorsed a
European Union-led initiative to establish a code of conduct for responsible space-faring nations.
An ambitious space treaty is inconceivable, but an executive agreement setting rules of the road for space could have strategic significance. At present, the Obama administration is too distracted and Beijing is too wary to seize this opportunity.

Syrian-Americans lobbying against the proposed American missile strike flooded Congressional message boards with appeals for Maaloula. A common refrain was that Mr. Obama was throwing Syria's Christians “to the lions.”
It was a powerful accusation in a region where a decade of unrest and rising sectarianism, from Iraq to Egypt, has threatened and displaced large sectors of the Middle East's Christians, a population that had already shrunk significantly through emigration over the past century.
Reached by telephone on Monday night, Mother Pelagia Sayaf, who is in charge of Mar Taqla, a monastery in Maaloula that is among the country's oldest, said that the 53 nuns and orphans staying there had not been harmed and that the principal damage was shattered windows. Another nun said some of the fighters were local men who promised to protect the monastery.
But the encounter with the rebels had done little to reassure the nuns that in the long run Syria's Christians would retain the peaceful existence they had long enjoyed.
“If Maaloula survives, it will be a miracle,” Mother Sayaf said. “Maaloula is empty. You see ghosts on the walls.”
The report's proposals, that are expected to form the basis of new legislation, seek to punish clients of prostitutes by hitting them with heavy fines. According to the report's author the aim is deterred “pimping networks and human trafficking” as well as reduce violence towards sex workers.
For a client's first offence they will be subject to a €1,500 fine and if caught reoffending the customer will risk six months in prison and a financial penalty of €7,500.
“Prostitutes are victims and should not be treated like criminals,” argued author of the report, the socialist MP Maud Olivier. “We are going to turn the law on its head.”
As well as reducing violence used towards prostitutes, the new law “is intended to educate, and to get it into the general mind-set that it is not normal to pay for sexual services.”
“We need to destroy the idea that prostitution is a happy trade,” Olivier added. “The idea is to reduce prostitution by reducing demand.”
Olivier says there are an estimated 40,000 sex workers in France, 80 percent of whom are women and 90 percent are immigrants.
Despite seemingly having the best interests of sex workers at heart, a prostitute and spokesperson for the sex workers' union Strass, told The Local this week that their job will become a lot more dangerous in future if the proposals become law.
“The prostitutes will be forced to work in remote places, hidden away so as not to risk being discovered by the police. This will simply mean they will be more exposed to violence, theft and rape,” said Manon, a 26-year-old, who has worked as a sex worker in the city of Toulouse for the last five years.
“It will also be more difficult for aid associations and charities etc to contact the prostitutes so it will be harder for them to try to prevent risky practices, or identify sex workers who may be in trouble and help them get access to housing etc.
“It is already difficult to go to the police and make a complaint and this law would make it even harder. Those who attack or rape prostitutes know this and the number of attacks and rapes will only increase".
'We are treated like lunatics'
Manon says the French government are failing to listen to the needs of sex workers.
“We are being treated like lunatics or like children who cannot speak up for themselves. We are are not being heard, despite the fact that many organisations agree with what we are saying.
“This proposal will lead to a reduction in the number of customers, because they will be worried about being caught by the police. So those on a lower income will risk accepting their client's requirements which can be dangerous, such as not using condoms.
“This may encourage prostitutes to employ a third person, to watch over them and make sure they are not attacked, so it is actually encouraging pimping not reducing it,” they said.
Manon claims the law will have the same “disastrous” consequences as former President Nicolas Sarkozy's 2003 legislation against 'passive soliciting'.
The law pushed many prostitutes out of city centre streets to more isolated locations. Many were forced to wear casual clothing, like jeans and trainers, to disguise their activity.
The new legislation would overturn that law if it is adopted by parliament.
We will stick to this commitment for one simple reason, because the introduction of this crime of passive soliciting has made the prostitutes the guilty party, when in fact 90 percent of them are victims of human trafficking,” said France's Minister for Women's Rights Najat Vallaud-Belkacem earlier this year.
Vallaud-Belkacem said shortly after taking up post that they wanted prostitution to disappear and has made it their mission to improve equality in France. But Manon says the minister's policy on prostitution will actually harm many women.
“Talking about égalité is all well and nice but this will make it worse for women and will push more of them into poverty. Where will they find the money to live from? They will be forced to take unemployment benefits, which will simply cost the government more money.”
Instead of being targeted with punitive laws Manon says the government should be making it easier for them to work safely by allowing here to rent an apartment where they can work.
“We want to be treated like any other workers," they said. “We are no different.”

All prophecies are fragile. They are subject to contradiction, to falsity. The false prophet, then, one might consider insane. But how does one interpret the language of prophecy? Is it a language of madness, of hidden truth, of images? Such questions are pertinent when discussing the works of visionary poet William Blake. Their prophecies or visions informed their poetic style and language and invested them with a vigor, energy, and substance that reach far beyond the mere meaning or signification of language. They claimed to experience visions of the prophet Elijah (among other visions). So was Blake insane? Blake, certainly, suffered from some type of mental illness. Their mood swings, their depressions, and their fervent, inspired productivity have been the subject of much debate. However, does mental illness necessarily detract from the value of their visionary poetry? Or does it contribute something to it? These questions cannot be answered adequately unless address the topic of mysticism as well. Blake was a follower of the esoteric religious doctrines of Emmanuel Swedenborg. The intersection of madness and mysticism is key to the understanding of Blake, if only because it demonstrates that this madness did not signify a necessary degeneration in the faculties of the mind, but rather a passionate commitment to the imagination, the spiritual, and the profound.
The question of madness and mysticism both were an early issue for Blake. Blake's father was an avid follower of Emmanuel Swedenborg who was a Swedish scientist and religious teacher. Swedenborg abandoned their studies of science in 1747 after claiming that they understood the inner nature of human beings (what they called the divine Word) after experiencing a vision in 1745. These visions reoccurred throughout their life as well as their supposed communications with angels. They published exegetical texts on Scripture in which they claimed they had received their interpretations from God himself. Swedenborg was a non-sectarian, however, and did not hold their teachings to be the property of any one faith. Swedenborg prophesied the emergence of a New Jerusalem on earth, which would signify the Second Coming. In essence, the kingdom of heaven would be on earth. Blake would maintain these beliefs throughout much of their life and would inspire their early verses such as "There Is No Natural Religion" and "All Religions Are One". Blake believed that whatever was divine in God must be divine in man.
At the same time Blake was learning of these doctrines as a boy, they began to experience visions and have communications with the angel Gabriel, the Virgin Mary, and various other figures from history and religious life. This sort of eccentric behavior would be indicative to their lifestyle and career. Blake was a controversial figure from the moment they ended their apprenticeship in engraving. They not only claimed to be a prophet and mystic, but they were a political radical as well. They had friendships with Thomas Paine, the famous pamphleteer of Common Sense and William Goodwin, a British anarchist who would go on to inspire Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Shelly. Blake's poetry was often politically motivated (such as their prophetic works on France and America) and mythic in proportions (The Book of Urizen and the Song of Los). Their engravings were considered eccentric, untraditional, and thoroughly odd. These engravings accompanied most of their works as well as other poets of the day. Blake also provided engravings for classic texts such as Dante's Divine Comedy. Blake was an iconoclast to say the least.
They were not truly appreciated in their time. It was not until 1818 that they developed a few admirers: Romantic movement Blake inspired wrote after Blake's death: "There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of Lord Byron and Walter Scott."
Blake's poetry is dense and multi-layered and expresses the wide range of emotions and thoughts that passed through their brain. Some of the most revealing verses are the symmetrical poems in the Songs of Innocence and the Songs of Experience. It is here that mysticism and madness intersect most explicitly. The Songs of Innocence are Blake's placid reflections on the liberating power of the imagination: of dreams and ethereal visions. The Songs of Experience clearly lay out the necessity of the human, rather than the mystical, the visceral rather than the reasonable. As Blake writes in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell", "The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction."
The image of the angel and other religious symbols figure powerfully in Blake's poetry not only because of their mystical and religious significance as cultural symbols but also because many of Blake's visions were religious in nature. In the Songs of Innocence Blake's poem "The Divine Image" reflects upon the idealistic tones of their mysticism and what they mean for the future of humanity.
To Mercy Pity Peace and Love,
All pray in their distress:
And to these virtues of delight
Return their thankfulness.
For Mercy Pity Peace and Love,
Is God our father dear:
And Mercy Pity Peace and Love,
Is Man their child and care.
For Mercy has a human heart
Pity, a human face:
And Love, the human form divine,
And Peace the human dress.
Then every man of every clime,
That prays in their distress,
Prays to the human form divine
Love Mercy Pity Peace.
And all must love the human form,
In heathen, turk or jew.
Where Mercy, Love & Pity dwell
There God is dwelling too.
(Blake, "The Divine Image", 111)
In this poem Blake attributes 4 divine characteristics to both God and man: mercy, pity, peace, and love. These divine attributes of God are reflections of what God finds in man (whom They have created), rather than vice versa. In line with Swedenborg's conception, the potential for realizing the divine is in man and does not require supernatural intercession. It only requires that man be in-tuned with the mystical powers they harbor within their own soul; those powers untouched by harsh experience and still connected to that which is Godly. It is no surprise, in light of Blake's own visionary experiences, that they would value this conception of the divine. In this sense, their madness could be explained away by being attributed to their own connection with the mystical power of their own human life.  They are simply a free spirit capable of realizing them. Blake's religious philosophy, as expressed in this poem, is one of innocence, forgiveness, and love. But it is more than an expression of Christian charity; it is a call for each individual to recognize the potential of their own creativity and imagination.
A very different portrayal of the spiritual is laid out in the Songs of Experience. In "The Angel", Blake communicates to the reader what has been communicated to them not only by the ethereal visitor of the poem but by the cruelty and baseness of life.
I Dreamt a Dream! what can it mean?
And that I was a maiden Queen:
Guarded by an Angel mild;
Witless woe, was ne'er beguil'd!
And I wept both night and day
And they wip'd my tears away
And I wept both day and night
And hid from them my hearts delight
So they took their wings and fled:
Then the morn blush'd rosy red:
I dried my tears & armd my fears,
With ten thousand shields and spears.
Soon my Angel came again:
I was arm'd, they came in vain:
For the time of yo
uth was fled
And grey hairs were on my head.
(Blake, 'The Angel', 124-5)
So who or what is the Angel? Could it be an overarching symbol for Blake's visionary experiences? And why so harsh? Why does the Angel flee and why does Blake arm themselves anticipating their return? Clearly, the focus of the poem is the change that has undergone the narrator. In the first stanzas the narrator is young and insecure. "And hid from them my hearts delight" immediately precedes the Angel's flight for a specific reason in this sense. The "hearts delight" is withheld from the Angel due to pride; with the accumulation of experience the Angel is no longer needed as a crutch. The narrator ceases crying and has "armd my fears". However, upon the Angels return the narrator has realized that pride has only succeeded in feeding the fear that once seemed so unbearable. The Angels return was not to help and protect our narrator, but to prepare this "maiden Queen" for death.
Originally this poem was intended be an allegory on chastity (Blake, p. 155 & 887n.) and the cycle of birth and death becomes even more interesting in terms of sexuality. Blake, who advocated free love, saw any attempt to repress human sensuality as disingenuous. In this case the Angel is the lover our maiden Queen refuses. They hide their own desires and squashes them, and the Angel's return, at death, is wasted since they are dying. Life should not be the process of repressing the living desires of humankind, but liberating them. Spirituality (the Angel) should liberate the senses so that our physical bodies can experience the infinite. Mysticism, then, separates itself from the repressive instinct of religion. Mysticism is in touch with all humankind, not simply the spiritual but the physical. Blake's mystical beliefs tie up the beauty of the divine with the beauty of the embodied. Experience when coupled with imagination (or innocence) allows us to experience the totality of existence; both are necessary in order to complete and understand the other. Thus, insanity was never an issue for Blake since, in their mind, it was perfectly reasonable to experience the divine through sensual, embodied perception.
These themes are elaborated upon greatly in sections of Blake's prose poem "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell". Blake, in this masterful work, explodes common conceptions of the role of religion and God in the life of human beings. In some ways, it draws out what is implied in the structure of the Songs of Innocence and Experience. Blake's goal, in these sets of verse, was to express the dual side of man's nature in order to disclose the infinite within them. In this work, "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell", Blake champions the infinite in man, in the face of the dogmatic discourses of religion and science. In this passage Blake recounts a communication with the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel.
"Isaiah answer'd. I saw no God, nor heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover'd the infinite in every thing, and as I was then perswaded, & remain confirm'd; that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of God, I cared not for consequences but wrote.
Then I asked: does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so?
They replied. All poets believe it does, & in ages of imagination this firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm persuasion of anything." (Blake, "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell", 186)
Notice that even without seeing God, Isaiah sees the infinite in "every thing", and is still persuaded of God's calling to him. The power of this persuasion, Isaiah admits, may be imaginary, but they did not think of the consequences of being seen a madman. They simply wrote what they knew. The power of conviction and persuasion overcame all obstacles that might have halted their spiritual growth. The experience of the mystical transcends any kind of categorical boundary of madness or sanity, or even truth or falsity. The divine is what we believe to be divine and are persuaded of; and once we have been persuaded, part of mystical experience and spiritual growth is conviction. So why is such mystical devotion taken to be delusion? Blake claims they saw Elijah, someone claims they hear the voice of God and their resolve cannot be shaken: how does one know this is not true? Does the body deceive the imagination; or does it merely seduce the soul due to some defect?
"But first the notion that man has a body distinct from the soul is to be expunged; this I shall do, by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid. [Note: Blake is referring to their practice as an engraver. Rather than carving their designs out with a chisel, they would use corrosive chemicals such as acids, dripping them onto the wood or metal "canvas" they used, into the design desired and to proceed to color them in]
If the doors of perception are cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.
For man has closed themselves up, till they see all things thro' narrow chinks of their cavern." (Blake, "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell", 188)
Indeed, the above passage implies, we are deceived. But we have deceived ourselves. And Blake sees it as their task as a poet and engraver to uncover what we have hidden from ourselves the infinite. Blake's temperament, their mood swings, their visions, were not so much, as Wordsworth states, a symptom of madness but rather, as Blake seems to assert, their sensitivity to the mystical underpinnings of life. So is Blake mad? I'm not sure this is a useful question given the blurred line between madness and the mystical in Blake's life and poetry. Rather, the question should be, what can Blake's supposed madness teach us?

The core defining aspect of Bitcoin—and other cryptocurrencies arising in its wake—is decentralisation. No one person, or no group of people, has control over it, and big companies don't have power over the individual user, at least in theory. But that idea isn't limited to currencies; the fundamental concept of a peer-to-peer system that connects people and allows transfer of information without a middleman has broader applications.
Take the internet. When Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, they purposely made it open, decentralised, and non-proprietary. But things have changed a lot in 25 years, and a few corporations have more control over our online activity than we could have imagined back then. Now, one company wants to change the state of play and “decentralize the entire internet and web.” And yes, the plan involves cryptocurrencies.
MaidSafe is a Scotland-based company headed by entrepreneur David Irvine, though they list their boss as “logic;” when I spoke to Irvine on the phone this week, they repeatedly referred to their project as the "logical" way for information to be organised and shared. What they're building is essentially an open source program that decentralizes the net by eliminating the need for huge servers in data centres (which are usually owned by the tech giants).
Instead, it uses the spare hard drive space of users' devices. Applications would sit on top of the system so you could use the internet much as usual, but your data wouldn't be stored as complete files on one server or local network. It would be shredded and encrypted, then dispersed in pieces across different computers in the network.
I called Irvine to find out more about what exactly MaidSafe is setting out to do, and how cryptocurrencies fit into the whole idea. The white paper for their decentralised internet system, called SAFE (Secure Access for Everyone) is available on GitHub, and this video is a good starting point to get your head around the idea:
MaidSafe was founded in 2006, which the Bitcoin-savvy will recognise as a couple of years prior to the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper. Irvine explained their inspiration at the time. “What was happening with the internet was control was being taken off people by corporations and whatnot, and data was being taken off people, and access to that information was being controlled by third parties,” they said. “It seemed quite an unnatural way for things to be.”
The “logical” way for the internet to be organised, in Irvine's view, doesn't require massive servers in data centres owned by big companies; they're an unnecessary middleman. In fact, you don't really need servers. “If you add up all the computers on our desks, it's much more powerful, with larger storage, and larger CPU than any large corporation,” they said. The SAFE network would be distributed across the hard drives and CPUs of devices linked up to the system—over at Wired, researcher Julia Powles explains it's a similar idea to the Bitcloud project, which uses the same idea of dispersed "nodes" carrying encrypted data, and includes cryptocurrency incentives. But where Bitcloud was announced as a concept, the SAFE network has been in development for years.
All the data on the SAFE network would of course be encrypted, too. As well as keeping information freely available and out of the clutches of profit-chasing companies or the eyesight of snoopers, Irvine suggested that using regular devices rather than huge servers could be much more eco-friendly than the current model, given the amount of electricity eaten up by data centres.
“What I thought was, all the computers have to connect to each other and form some sort of large cyber brain machine type thing, so that as humans we just make an account on the system and it's only between us and the system, no intermediary,” they said. Got that?
Image: Maidsafe
As a user, you probably wouldn't notice you were using the SAFE network; it's a platform on which applications are built. You could have, for instance, a Google-like application built on top of it, or a Facebook-like application, and so on. MaidSafe has invited third-party developers to start working on applications, and there are distinct advantages to building on the system. For instance, one developer is working on a Dropbox-type service, but won't need to invest in infrastructure and buy disk space anywhere. “Everyone's computer brings resources to the network, so all you do is you build the front end—the storage, the computing is all taken care of by the network,” said Irvine.
This is where the SafeCoin cryptocurrency comes in, because users aren't expected to contribute their precious disk space for nothing but the good of the system, nor are the open source developers who are working on applications to sit on top of the SAFE network.
“The idea behind it was that if you have a completely privacy-enhancing, anonymous, and autonomous network, the last thing you can expect is someone puts their credit card in and gives away all of their information,” explained Irvine. “And who would you give that information to? This network's an autonomous thing.” By that they mean that no one is in charge of the network; no one would have to run it once it's set up.
The cryptocurrency aspect allows coins to be deposited in users' wallets depending on resources they contribute. So you'd earn safecoins just for using the system (MaidSafe calls it "farming" rather than "mining," but it's the same idea), the idea being to incentivize people to get involved. Developers would also be able to use safecoins as a revenue model; they could write wallets in their applications and receive coins according to how popular their application is. MaidSafe actually calls safecoins a “software token” and it works a bit differently than Bitcoin. Irvine said it doesn't use a Blockchain-like ledger approach, but is more like cash—no one knows you've made a transaction except for the recipient.
But before applications are available, the currency has already come into play; people are able to buy safecoins before the launch to help raise funds to get the system started. The company held a public sale this week that saw 10 percent of the total amount of safecoins (just short of 430 million) up for grabs in exchange for bitcoins or mastercoins, at 17,000 safecoins per bitcoin (Coin Desk explains that as safecoins aren't on the Bitcoin blockchain, buyers got them via the proxy token of maidsafecoins, which do work with the blockchain and will be exchangeable for safecoins on a 1:1 ratio). People buying in now are either supporters of the SAFE system and want to see it take off, or see safecoins as a good investment; Irvine said he'd already seen some on exchanges. As there's a limited number of safecoins and they'll require increasing amounts of resources to earn, there's a demand among people who are confident that SAFE might take off.
"The things that we can achieve with a free, secure, and privacy-enhancing internet are beyond what we can even dream of today."
This week's sale was to help raise funds for MaidSafe, and get people involved in the network. MaidSafe plans to use some of the funds to set up international development units, and to seed the network with tens of thousands of computers around the world to start it off.
I asked if the SAFE system couldn't have been implemented somehow without the need for a cryptocurrency, and Irvine said the idea was to come up with a way that didn't mean people were limited by a system that only let them use as many resources as they were able to put in themselves. “The problem with that is a lot of people today just have mobile phones and just have tablets; they don't have resources that would be particularly valuable to the network, like a PC,” they said. The cryptocurrency element means people with limited resources can still use the system in the same way; they just don't get so many safecoins.
Of course, their are other barriers in the digital divide, and MaidSafe is a private company, not a philanthropic exercise. It's also in very early stages and there are no doubt many questions that need to be ironed out. But the idea is nothing if not ambitious, and Irvine's not planning to stop with just the web. They threw out other ideas: a global decentralised voting system that's cryptographically secure, a propaganda-free global news system made by the people and distributed in different countries via avatars speaking their own language.
“The things that we can achieve with a free, secure, and privacy-enhancing internet are beyond what we can even dream of today,” they said. Whether it will ever take off is anyone's guess, and I'm skeptical that any new system would ever be widely adopted in place of the long-established current model for the internet. Forbes' Kashmir Hill pointed out that it might just be way too soon for such an idea, given that most people don't even understand Bitcoin yet.
At the least, it's refreshing to see a take on the current vogue for decentralisation that has its sights set a little higher than the next novelty crypto-clone.

Several more current and former National Security Agency insiders, inspired by American fugitive Edward Snowden, have come forward as whistleblowers with details of the shadowy agency's operations, according to an attorney at a whistleblower protection organization.
"I think the government hopes to chill speech by employees in the national security and intelligence fields, especially those at the NSA and CIA, but the unintended consequence is [that] more and more whistleblowers are coming through the doors of the Government Accountability Project (GAP)," said Jesselyn Radack, referring to the organization where they work as the National Security and Human Rights Director. "I think courage is contagious, and we see more and more people from the NSA coming through our door after Snowden made these revelations."
Radack, an attorney who has met with and been in communication with Snowden, said "a handful" of people in the intelligence community have come forward since this summer when several major international newspapers began writing about the NSA's classified foreign and domestic surveillance programs - stories based on thousands of secret NSA documents allegedly stolen by Snowden, a former NSA contractor.
FULL COVERAGE: NSA Surveillance
Snowden has been charged in the U.S. with espionage-related crimes, and America's top intelligence officials said they are a traitor who has put America's national security in jeopardy.
But the legal threats and high-level condemnation haven't kept others from coming forward with new information, Radack said.
"There definitely could be more revelations in addition to those that Snowden has revealed and that are continuing to come out," they told ABC News.
Snowden is currently living in Russia, after being granted temporary asylum there. Today their Russian lawyer said they had gotten a job at a major Russian website. Radack said they were unaware of any new employment for Snowden.

With deer hunting season underway, state wildlife officials are asking hunters who travel outside the state to be mindful of import restrictions before returning home.
The restrictions are in place in an effort to keep chronic wasting disease out of Tennessee.
The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency has launched a social media campaign to remind hunters who pursue big game, including deer, elk and moose, about the restrictions.
There are 24 states in the United States and two Canadian provinces that are CWD positive and importation from them is banned.

CWD is a contagious and neurological disease deadly to members of the cervid family. It is transmitted through animal to animal contact, animal contact with a contaminated environment and with contaminated food or water sources.
CWD is not known to infect humans or livestock.
"We are so fortunate that we have not had to deal with CWD in our state," TWRA assistant wildlife and forest chief Chuck Yoest said. "If Tennessee ever becomes CWD positive, it will mean that our agency will have to spend a tremendous amount of our focus on containing it. In terms of deer hunting, this disease would cause us to rethink how we manage our herds."
Yoest said Tennessee's elk herd, which is much smaller than the deer heard, also could be jeopardized by a CWD outbreak.
Tennessee's import restrictions require that the carcasses of deer, elk and moose legally killed outside the state be cleaned and dressed beyond what is typically done by most hunters before being brought into the state.

The first beta release of PostgreSQL 10 was announced a couple of days ago. This release brings with it the much-awaited logical replication feature.
We decided to take it for a spin and see how it works.
Streaming Replication
The existing replication feature built into PostgreSQL is called Streaming Replication. If you aren't familiar with it, check out our popular blog post about it.
Essentially, you can use streaming replication to maintain multiple, up-to-date, read-only replicas of a single PostgreSQL server (technically, a single PostgreSQL cluster). This contains databases, roles (users), tablespaces and more.
With streaming replication, you get all or nothing. The replicas (standbys) are byte-for-byte copies of the main server's set of on-disk files. Streaming replication is perfect for maintaining a hot standby server, to which you can fail over in case the primary server fails. They are also good for maintaining read-only replicas for analytics-related use cases.
What streaming replication cannot do is to replicate a subset of the data in the main server. If you want to have an off-server copy of, say a single table, it won't be possible with streaming replication.
You also can't modify the data in the replica with streaming replication. Let's say you use the replica for analytics, and need to delete the data once your daily batch jobs are done processing it. The deletion won't work because the replica is strictly read-only with streaming replication.
Streaming replication also does not work across PostgreSQL versions. You can't upgrade PostgreSQL versions without downtime by trying to bring up a standby with the next PostgreSQL version then failing over to it.
Typically, you'd use one of the tools listed here to implement such requirements. But now with logical replication, it's possible to do most of these without external tools. At the very least, it is a powerful tool on which to further build customized solutions.

Logical Replication
Logical Replication can replay, logically, the changes (as in insert, update, delete of rows) happening to one or more persistent tables in a database.
The source server must create a named object called a Publication. A publication serves as an endpoint from which a log of changes can be fetched by a Subscription. The subscription is created on another, a destination, server. The subscription includes a standard connection string that tells how to connect to the source server.
Let's see how it works. First, we have a server that has a database dbsrc , which has a table t1 :
dbsrc=# create table t1 (id integer primary key, val text); CREATE TABLE dbsrc=# \d t1 Table "public.t1" Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default --------+---------+-----------+----------+--------- id | integer | | not null | val | text | | | Indexes: "t1_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id) dbsrc=#
We'll also need a user with replication privileges:
dbsrc=# create user replicant with replication; CREATE ROLE dbsrc=# grant select on t1 to replicant; GRANT dbsrc=#
Unlike streaming replication, the replication user needs read access to the tables themselves.
Let's insert some rows into t1 before we start replication:
dbsrc=# insert into t1 (id, val) values (10, 'ten'), (20, 'twenty'), (30, 'thirty'); INSERT 0 3 dbsrc=# select * from t1; id | val ----+-------- 10 | ten 20 | twenty 30 | thirty (3 rows) dbsrc=#
OK, here comes the first logical replication related command. We'll create a publication pub1 that will serve as an endpoint for replicating changes happening to the table t1 :
dbsrc=# create publication pub1 for table t1; CREATE PUBLICATION dbsrc=#
Now let's connect to another server, with another database called dbdst . Unlike streaming replication, we need to create the table t1 here first. If we try to create a subscription without that:
dbdst=# create subscription sub1 connection 'dbname=dbsrc user=replicant' publication pub1; ERROR: relation "public.t1" does not exist dbdst=#
it doesn't work. So let's create the table:
dbdst=# create table t1 (id integer primary key, val text, val2 text); CREATE TABLE dbdst=# \d t1 Table "public.t1" Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default --------+---------+-----------+----------+--------- id | integer | | not null | val | text | | | val2 | text | | | Indexes: "t1_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id) dbdst=#
Ha! We snuck another column in there. Let's create the subscription and see what happens:
dbdst=# create subscription sub1 connection 'dbname=dbsrc user=replicant' publication pub1; NOTICE: synchronized table states NOTICE: created replication slot "sub1" on publisher CREATE SUBSCRIPTION dbdst=# select * from t1; id | val | val2 ----+--------+------ 10 | ten | 20 | twenty | 30 | thirty | (3 rows) dbdst=#
It's replicated! We can see the initial set of rows in the destination table. Further changes get replicated as well:
dbsrc=# delete from t1 where id=10; DELETE 1 dbsrc=# insert into t1 (id, val) values (40, 'forty'); INSERT 0 1 dbsrc=#
Here they are on the destination:
dbdst=# select * from t1; id | val | val2 ----+--------+------ 20 | twenty | 30 | thirty | 40 | forty | (3 rows) dbdst=#
Things work as expected. Let's try some modifications on the destination and see what happens:
dbdst=# update t1 set val2 = 'foo'; UPDATE 3 dbdst=# delete from t1 where id = 20; DELETE 1 dbdst=# select * from t1; id | val | val2 ----+--------+------ 30 | thirty | foo 40 | forty | foo (2 rows) dbdst=#
Let's also do some modifications on the source:
dbsrc=# insert into t1 (id, val) values (50, 'fifty'); INSERT 0 1 dbsrc=# update t1 set val = 'bar' where id = 30; UPDATE 1 dbsrc=# select * from t1; id | val ----+-------- 20 | twenty 40 | forty 50 | fifty 30 | bar (4 rows) dbsrc=#
And here's what we get at the end of it all:
dbdst=# select * from t1; id | val | val2 ----+-------+------ 40 | forty | foo 50 | fifty | 30 | bar | (3 rows) dbdst=#
Interesting! We see that:
the row we deleted at the destination stays deleted
the row we updated only at the destination stays the same
the row we updated first at the destination and then at the source got updated entirely – the entire tuple has been replaced, and our changes to “val2” column have been lost
the row we inserted at the source was replicated
Let's try something else now. What happens if we delete the table t1 at the destination and then recreate it?
dbdst=# drop table t1; DROP TABLE dbdst=# create table t1 (id integer primary key, val text, val2 text); CREATE TABLE dbdst=# select * from t1; id | val | val2 ----+-----+------ (0 rows) dbdst=#
Oops, we broke the magic! To get the sync back on, we need to refresh the subscription:
dbdst=# alter subscription sub1 refresh publication; NOTICE: added subscription for table public.t1 ALTER SUBSCRIPTION dbdst=# select * from t1; id | val | val2 ----+--------+------ 20 | twenty | 40 | forty | 50 | fifty | 30 | bar | (4 rows) dbdst=#
Ah, we're back in business! Refreshing is needed in other cases too, like if the publication was altered to include another table.
Going From Here
There are a few more things that logical replication can do that we didn't cover here:
publishing only insertions, updates or deletions to tables
pulling in changes from multiple sources into one destination
adding more tables into an existing publication
transactional consistency – destinations see only complete and committed transactions
streaming replication – streaming and logical replication features work independently without interfering with each other
If you're planning to get your hands dirty trying out logical replication for yourself, here are somethings that'll help:
In the source server's postgresql.conf , set wal_level = logical , max_replication_slots = 10 .
, set , . Also ensure pg_hba.conf is updated for the replication user to connect.

NEW DELHI: Failure of Railway staff is the biggest cause behind train accidents and derailments that have led to maximum deaths and injuries to passengers, said a safety report submitted to Railway Ministry Railway has constituted a task force on safety on December 6 last year after the derailment near Kanpur, killing 151 people.The committee comprising senior railway officials involved in safety mechanism was asked to conduct data analysis of investigation into the past accidents and developed a "factual view of potential solutions."The report submitted recently has categorically stated the failure of railway staff is the biggest cause in 50 to 60 per cent cases, and derailments cause maximum deaths and injuries.According to the report, asset failures like track defects such as rail fracture and inadequate maintenance remain the biggest cause of accidents.Taking note of increase in number of derailments due to rail-fractures and weld failures, it has suggested a need to address the backlog in rail/track renewals and the technology of rail welding.Advocating technology upgradation to have less dependence on human intervention, the report said "Inspection of Rails is a complex exercise and must be automated as much as possible to reduce dependence on human judgement."

Tea party activists are attacking a campaign finance rider in the $1.1 trillion spending bill that they view as a sneaky power grab by establishment Republicans designed to undermine outside conservative groups.
The provision would increase the amount of money a single donor could give to national party committees each year from $97,200 to as much as $777,600 by allowing them to set up different funds for certain expenses. The change would be a huge boost for party committees that have faced steep challenges in recent years from well-funded outside groups.
Story Continued Below
Disgruntled activists fear the committees will unleash the added cash against conservative candidates in primaries, making it even harder for them to unseat establishment-friendly incumbents. Most tea party groups have political action committees for which individual donations are capped at $10,000 per election cycle. Some also have super PACs, which do not have any contribution limits.
The same conservative activists have long advocated for looser campaign finance laws, but they argue the language of the rider in the 1,600-page bill gives the establishment wing an unfair advantage by tweaking the law specifically for donations to party committees.
“Conservatives support the First Amendment and believe there should be no limits on political speech,” said Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund. “Unfortunately, the new limits included in the omnibus only increase political speech for party insiders while silencing the majority of Americans who are fed up with Washington.”
Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin opened their show Wednesday night by warning listeners of the legislation. Calling the rider “an outrage among many outrages” in the spending bill, Levin characterized it as a “power hungry” move by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“Do you know why he's doing that? It's to destroy any conservative any group that seeks to challenge an incumbent, to destroy the entire primary process,” Levin alleged. “That's what McConnell is up to.”
McConnell was one of the Republican incumbents targeted by tea party activists in this year's primaries. But, like most other establishment candidates this cycle, they defeated their primary opponent. They will take over as the Senate majority leader in January.
Asked to comment, McConnell's office simply noted that the Kentucky Republican was not responsible for the proposed rider.
Under the campaign finance provision, party committees will be able to increase their overall contribution limit by setting up different funds for building and legal costs. At face value, the language would seem to forbid the new cash from being used to pay for television ads, polling or other electioneering.
But tea party activists fear – and lawyers and political scientists expect — that the parties will find creative ways to stretch the new cash.
“They've made nice little categories here, but the question is whether they're going to play games in interpreting what fits into these categories,” said Ray La Raja, a University of Massachusetts professor who specializes in studying political parties.
Even if the new funds created by this week's rider are exclusively used for the narrowly intended purposes, “it still frees up money for TV ads” by allowing the parties to defray other bills they previously would have been required to pay out of their general coffers, La Raja added.
They pointed out that, in the days before the 2002 McCain-Feingold law banned unlimited so-called “soft money” contributions to the parties, that cash was legally supposed to be used exclusively for “party building activities,” but the parties found ways to use it for TV ads that, to most viewers, seemed like plain old campaign ads.
Multiple GOP party committee officials declined to comment on the record. But a senior Republican Party official supportive of the rider argued: “The committees are the most transparent entities, so this is a step in the right direction for people who believe there's too much money in politics.”
The tea party's opposition to the rider puts it in rare agreement with progressives, who also are criticizing the provision but for different reasons. Democratic Party committees would also benefit from the measure, but they do not have the same level of intra-party strife as the Republicans.
In a statement calling on Democrats to oppose the spending bill, Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said the rider would gut “campaign finance laws” and “would represent Democrats marching in the exact wrong direction.” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also cited the campaign finance provision as one of the two reasons for Democrats to sink the bill.
The tea party groups opposed to the rider include FreedomWorks and Citizens United, who argued the legislation was unfair.
“More and more, voters are evaluating candidates on their individual principles, not by political identity. So it's important that all individuals can be heard in the process, not just the party machines,” said Jackie Bodnar, spokesperson for FreedomWorks.
In a statement Thursday, Citizens United President David Bossie said: “What congressional leaders are doing is what they do best: protecting incumbents and the two-party system. The omnibus rider will only strengthen the Washington establishment in both parties and not create a level playing field for candidates who are outside the Beltway.”
In a column titled “The One Thing McConnell Will Fight For” in the Conservative Review, Daniel Horowitz made a point that further fanned the fury among the tea party activists: Establishment Republicans are fine with pushing campaign finance changes in the spending bill, but not with including legislation against President Barack Obama's recent executive order on immigration.
“This is unreal,” Horowitz writes. “The Republican leader has no interest in fighting Obama's illegal amnesty and is vehemently opposed to attaching a refund rider [on the immigration order] to the budget bill, yet they are willing to stand up and delay the sacrosanct budget bill in order to grow the power of the political parties.”

The Ultimate Guide to Making Custom Items Using /spawnitem in Starbound 1.0
WARNING: DO NOT USE THESE COMMANDS WITH IMPORTANT CHARACTERS. You might corrupt them!
Around a year ago, a reddit user by the name of Yokoca made a guide(?) on how to use /spawnitem.
However, as of Cheerful Giraffe (1.0) (why are the version names so dumb), it no longer works.
So I decided to make an up-to-date guide using my own research!
Before we start, I highly recommend that you unpack the game's files. This will help a lot with making custom items.
Just google “How to unpack Starbound“ for several tutorials on how to do this.
Once you've done that, move the unpacked assets elsewhere if you don't want the game to take several minutes to load.
And once you've done that and made yourself an admin (/admin), it's time to begin making cool (and probably also overpowered) items!
(Note: This guide uses a lot of JSON. I recommend that you use JSONLint to help with troubleshooting. Also, Tumblr messes with the commands, so I put them all in this pastebin link.)
Let's start by just spawning a random weapon. I chose the pistol:
Pastebin Command 1
You can change this to any weapon you want, but I recommend the generated weapons.
The “common“ at the beginning only works on generated weapons. The available options are “common“, “uncommon“ and “rare“.
Pressing enter will spawn the weapon at your cursor.
But this thing is way too bland. Let's mess with it!
At the end of the command, add * 1 ‘{}'*. (without the asterisks, include all the spaces)
Pastebin Command 2
Let's start with the simple stuff.
All weapons spawned without parameters (the curly brackets) are all at Level 1.
This is the level of the weapons you find on Low threat level planets. You know, the planets you start on?
Yeah, we need to fix this. Now.
Inside the parameters, add *”level”:(Number between 1 to 10)*.
I chose Level 10:
Pastebin Command 3
You can also set a seed. This will make the command spawn the same weapon every time.
After “level”, Add *,“seed”:(Random number)*.
I chose 0:
Pastebin Command 4
You can also change the weapon's name and “displayed rarity".
After “seed“, add *,”shortdescription”:”(Name)”,”rarity”:”(Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary or Essential)”*.
I chose “The Experiment“ for the name, and “Legendary“ for the rarity:
Pastebin Command 5
To change the weapon's elemental type, add *”elementalType“:”(Type)”*.
You can use “fire“, “ice“, “electric“ and “poison“.
I chose “fire“:
Command 24
But this was just the simple stuff. Let's get crazy.
First of, we're gonna clear the old parameters (optional) and add *”primaryAbility”:{}*.
To change the weapon's cooldown, damage, energy consumption, projectile count and inaccuracy, add “fireTime“, “baseDps“, “energyUsage“, “projectileCount“ and “inaccuracy“ inside “primaryAbility”'s parameters respectively:
Command 6
“fireTime“, “baseDps“ and “energyUsage” all have Multiplier counterparts. Just add “Factor“ to the end of them (e.g. “fireTimeFactor”).
Now that I've taught you how to change weapon stats, let's learn how to change weapon sounds.
This is why I told you to unpack the game earlier.
First, go here:
Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\assets\unpacked\sfx
Once you've done that, pick a sound. I've picked “grenade1.ogg“ in the “gun“ folder.
Once you've done that, in the main parameters, add *“animationCustom”:{“sounds”:{“fire”:[“(Sound location)”]}}*.
The sound location of “grenade1.ogg“ is */sfx/gun/grenade1.ogg*.
Here's the full command (I've cleared the old parameters again, by the way. I've also set the seed to 0):
Command 7
Have you ever thought to yourself, “Man, bullets are boring“?
Well, you're in luck, because you can make guns shoot things other projectiles too!
This is where the fun really starts.
First, navigate to the “projectiles“ folder in the game's unpacked assets.
Next, pick a projectile. Go into its folder and get its name. I chose “grenade“.
(Note: Projectiles that require specific data (Projectiles that summon Monsters, Magnorbs, etc.) crash the game when shot from a gun.)
Once you've done that, in “primaryAbility“'s parameters, add *“projectileType”:“(Projectile Name)”*:
Command 8
Combining all of the commands I've taught you so far can make something like this.
Command 9
And this.
Command 10
And this!
Command 11
The last one uses “animationParts“ to change the gun's appearance when held.
It goes in the main parameters. It works similar to “sounds” in “animationCustom“:
Command 12
For the entire tutorial, I've been neglecting swords.
Time to fix that!
Swords work similarly to Guns, except they don't use “energyUsage“, “projectileCount“ and “inaccuracy“.
“animationParts“ also uses “handle“ and “blade“ instead of “butt“, “middle“ and “barrel“.
Here's a (pretty big) example of a custom shortsword:
Command 13
I've also been neglecting Special Abilities.
Let's fix that too!
Remember when we changed a gun's stats and made it shoot something other than bullets?
You can do that with a lot of the Special Abilities as well!
But first, we need to specify what Special Ability we want on our gun (we're starting with those first).
(Note: Don't put Special Abilities on one-handed weapons. It has some weird behaviour.)
I went ahead and set up the simple stuff:
Command 14
Now that that's done, let's set its special ability!
First, go to “items”, then “active”, then “weapons” in the game's unpacked assets.
Then go to either “melee” or “ranged”, depending on which ability you want to add to your weapon.
(Note: Adding a melee ability on a ranged weapon and vice-versa crashes the game.)
Then go to “abilities”.
Then choose the ability you want! I've chosen “rocketburst“.
Once you've done that, in the main parameters, add *”altAbilityType”:”(Ability Name)”,”altAbility”:{}*.
Command 15
Now that we've learnt how to set a weapon's special ability, let's change the ability itself!
Earlier, I said that you can change an ability's stats and projectile type.
Let's do that now!
Some variables work on some abilities, some don't.
Some abilities have extra variables. For example, “rocketburst“ has “burstCount“ and “burstTime“.
Let's change those extra variables!
Instead of putting the variables in “primaryAbility“'s parameters, put them in “altAbility“'s parameters instead.
I've made Rocket Burst shoot twice as many rockets, twice as fast:
Command 16
And now we're gonna slap “projectileType” onto the weapon as well.
I've chosen “iceplasmarocket“:
Command 17
Much better.
To change the sound the ability makes, use “animationCustom“, but instead of putting “fire“ in “sounds“, put “altFire“ instead.
This is different for some abilities.
Now that we've done guns, let's do swords!
I made a broadsword with “travelingslash“ as its ability:
Command 18
This ability has “cooldownTime“. It starts after the animation ends.
Let's set it to 0!
Command 19
This is much more fun.
But not as fun as changing the projectile as well!
I chose “energyarrow“:
Command 20
You don't even have to make these special abilities. You can make them primary. Just change “alt" in “altAbilityType“ and “altAbility“ to “primary“.
…Though, on most abilities, this has some weird behaviour.
You can even change unique weapons like the Miniknog Launcher:
Command 21
(Discovered how to do this one when iv2b on the starbound reddit asked me how to slow down projectiles!)
Sometimes, you want to change the speed or knockback of your projectile.
This is where “projectileParameters“ comes in.
In “???Ability“, add *“projectileParameters”:{}*.
The variables that you can use that I know of are “speed“, “power“ and “knockback“:
Command 22
Don't you hate it when you make, for example, a rocket launcher that's supposed to shoot 10 times a second, but only shoots 3 times a second?
Don't worry, we can get rid of that!
In “???Ability“'s parameters, add *”stances”:{”cooldown“:{”duration“:(Fire Rate)}}*:
Command 23
Oh yeah, Staves. Those exist.
Staves are pretty interesting too!
Let's make a wand instead because 2 abilities is too much!
For the ability, I chose “plasmabarrage“.
Do not use elemental abilities. They'll crash the game no matter what.
Command 25
Pretty cool, pretty cool. But let's make it more unique.
“plasmabarrage“ has 3 extra variables: “projectileDistance“, “projectileDelayFirst“ and “projectileDelayEach“.
Let's use them!
Command 26
And of course, we can't forget “projectileType“:
Command 27
And before I end the post, here are some weapons made by me and other people who used this guide!
johnsnail (Me):
Creation 1
iv2b:
Creation 1
Xefs
Creation 1
Creation 2
Creation 3
Creation 4
floranscholar123
Creation 1
And that's it!…for now.
Now, with your new knowledge, go make the coolest weapon ever!
…Unless you're not into doing stuff like this and just thought this was interesting.
Anyway, thanks for reading!
This was my biggest post yet.
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the leading opposition-backed candidate in Iran's presidential election, was disqualified on Tuesday from standing in a blow to those hoping for significant change when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad leaves office.
Iranian state-run television broadcast a statement by the interior ministry on Tuesday night announcing the final list of candidates. It did not include Rafsanjani or President Ahmadinejad's close ally, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei.
Eight men were allowed to enter the race for the election on 14 June, including Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili; the mayor of Tehran, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf; and former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati. Hassan Rouhani, a reformist who is seen as having little chance of victory, was also allowed to run. Jalili is widely seen as the favourite candidate of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
More than 680 people, among them some 40 prominent figures, registered as potential candidates this month in the hope of succeeding Ahmadinejad, but the six clergymen and six jurists of the Guardian Council allowed only a handful to stand.
The council's spokesperson, Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, said on Tuesday the vetting process had ended and the final list of candidates had been sent to the interior ministry but did not name those qualified, the semi-official Isna news agency reported. The candidates were then announced on national TV.
Conservative websites and semi-official agencies had earlier reported that Rafsanjani, 78, who has won the support of the country's reformers, had been disqualified because they are seen as too feeble to govern the country. Their supporters said the reports amounted to no more than rumours spread by rival camps.
"If an individual who wants to take up a high post can only perform a few hours of work each day, naturally that person cannot be confirmed," Kadkhodaei said earlierthis week, boosting speculation that Rafsanjani would be blocked. Two of the Guardian Council's 12 members are older than Rafsanjani.
The hardline Kayhan newspaper, whose director is appointed by Khamenei, ran an editorial on Tuesday calling on the Guardian Council to disqualify Rafsanjani, saying they had become the favourite candidate of the country's enemies and opposition.
"A divine and serious responsibility rests on the shoulders of the Guardian Council. It is to rescue Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani from a dangerous bait that has been set for them by foreign enemies and their domestic associates," wrote Kayhan's Hossein Shariatmadari. Rafsanjani's office fought back by issuing a statement saying their opponents had resorted to fabricating news in order to distort the old man's image.
Rafsanjani's disqualification would come as a surprise to many of their supporters, who thought it unlikely the Guardian Council would reject him, given their crucial role in founding the Islamic republic and their position as one of the country's great political survivors.
Ali Motahari, an influential MP who was appointed on Tuesday as head of a major campaign group supporting Rafsanjani, predicted that Khamenei might intervene to reinstate Rafsanjani.
"Rafsanjani played a significant role in founding the Islamic republic … Their disqualification will call into question the very principles of our revolution and the principles of the ruling system of the Islamic republic," they told the semi-official Isna news agency. Rafsanjani is head of Iran's expediency council, which mediates between the parliament and the Guardian Council.
Mashaei, who is seen as a nationalist figure, was widely expected to be barred despite Ahmadinejad's unwavering support. Supporters of Khamenei have accused Mashaei of putting Iran ahead of Islam and not showing enough loyalty to the supreme leader.
The Iran News Network, a pro-Ahmadinejad website, reported on Monday that a group of activists and campaigners sympathetic to Mashaei had been arrested and some summoned for questioning. Access to at least four pro-Mashaei websites was blocked last week. Analysts fear that Ahmadinejad might go out with all guns firing following Mashaei's disqualification. The president was reported to have cancelled three of their provincial visits this week to stay in the capital, Tehran.
Meanwhile, the Fars news agency, which is affiliated to the elite Revolutionary Guards, published a series of interviews with some leading clerics who called on people to respect the Guardian Council's decision.
Rafsanjani was a close confidant of Khamenei for much of the 1980s and 1990s but the pair fell out when the former lost to Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential vote. The rift between the two widened when Rafsanjani voiced moderate support for Iran's Green movement in 2009 while Khamenei stood firm by Ahmadinejad and denied any allegations of vote rigging.
Rafsanjani's last-minute entry in Iran's presidential race had revived hopes among the country's reformers for a change in the country's trajectory and infuriated hardliners who believed their candidacy would challenge Khamenei's authority.
Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the number two Senate Republican, signaled the hardline approach GOP leaders may take if Hillary Clinton becomes president in an interview Wednesday.
Appearing on radio host Joe Pagliarulo's program, Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, said congressional investigations would continue into Clinton if they win the White House.
Senate Republicans would work closely with House Oversight Committee chairperson Jason Chaffetz, Cornyn added. Chaffetz told the Washington Post last week that "it's a target-rich environment" for congressional inquiries into Clinton.
"If we retain the Senate majority, which I'm hopeful of, we should also work with our House colleagues to continue our investigations and oversight hearings. There are things we can do," Cornyn said.
Cornyn also told Pagliarulo that, although it was highly unlikely, it was "a fair question" whether Clinton would pardon themselves if they were elected president and believed it was "possible" that President Obama would grant them a pardon before they leave office.
On August 14, 2004, Dhananjoy Chatterjee, a security guard in Kolkata, was hanged on the charges of raping and murdering 18 year-old Hetal Parekh. Chatterjee was accused of raping and killing Parekh in their apartment on March 5, 1990, convicted and executed 14 years later after a lengthy trial.
The Bengali movie Dhananjoy, directed by Arindam Sil, revisits the trial and the accompanying media hysteria, which was led by political heavyweights, including former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's wife Meera. Chatterjee maintained their innocence throughout their incarceration, and legal activists pointed out that they had been convicted on the basis of dubious eyewitness testimonies and flimsy circumstantial evidence.
Arindam Sil, who has a penchant for turning out crisp and topical crime thrillers, says they were drawn to the subject because of the injustice meted out to Chatterjee and their family. The August 11 release stars Anirban Bhattacharya in the lead role. In a conversation with Scroll.in, Sil spoke about trial by hysteria and the importance of revisiting the case 27 years later.
What attracted you to the Dhananjoy Chatterjee story?
It actually happened through one of my friends, filmmaker Atanu Ghosh. Atanu emailed a few links to me and I found them interesting. I called them and said, wouldn't it be nice if we made a film on this subject? They said, I want you to make a film on this, which is why I sent you this stuff.
Then, of course, I got into it. I started my research, started meeting people. I came across the book by professors of the Indian Statistical Institute. I met Dhananjoy's family, their neighbours. I met people who testified in court at the time that Dhananjoy was a culprit but now said that they had appeared as false witnesses under duress. They also said that they had been made to sign on some papers that were in English.
Even as more such startling facts came up, I became more and more stubborn about making this film.
Play Dhananjoy (2017).
When was this?
This was about a year ago. The research went on for seven-eight months. During a conversation with Shrikant Mohta of Shree Venkatesh Films, I told them that a film must be made about this trial. Within five minutes, they agreed. So that's how it started off. Then the whole process became quite painful… extremely.
In what way? Did you face any resistance?
No, there wasn't any resistance. The process was painful because we were coming across facts that defied the norms. We came across a family that had been tormented for the past 27 years. Yet, when we visited their home, it seemed as though Dhananjoy had been hanged just yesterday.
The family was disturbed both by the media and the police. They live in absolute fear, every day. They still fear the taunts and bad mouthing by the media, neighbours and the entire village. Because I made a film about Dhananjoy, their neighbours heckled them, alleging that they had been paid four or five lakhs to agree to the film. They have not taken a single rupee from us.
Our society takes some responsibilities but also acts foolishly, and that's why Dhananjoy was hanged. Even before the court judgement was out, society had decided. The chief minister [Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee] said, I will resign if Dhananjoy is not hanged. How could someone sitting in their chair say this? They had no right.
Everybody chanted, they are Dhananjoy, they are a rapist, kill him. There was no direct evidence, there were no conclusive circumstantial evidence. There was no semen found in the vagina, no tissue culture was done. There were a series of serious lapses and this family had no money to fight till the Supreme Court.
My heart goes out to Hetal Parekh. Hetal and Dhananjoy, and the things Hetal's family had to go through. But that doesn't mean that we will bury the truth.
Have you met Hetal Parekh's family?
The family cannot be found. When I last heard, they were somewhere in Mumbai. I know Hetal's father has passed away; their mother is not in their senses. Their brother is now married but they cannot really be found.
Hetal Parekh's family has been destroyed; Dhananjoy Chatterjee's family is living in fear. Why do you think this film had to be made?
Firstly, even after 27 years, if there has been an injustice and if I can in my way contribute towards the truth about the family that has been disgraced, I have to do it.
Secondly, this is the ideal time to speak about a subject like this because the excessive condemnation of various issues that are happening in India nowadays is alarming. We are social creatures and have our responsibilities, so whatever happened 27 years back is being perpetuated with a different kind of aggression. The kind of celebrity bashing that goes on, just like that… Do you criticise yourself in the social media to that extent? Have you ever thought about how you would react if you were put in the same shoes?
Mass hysteria has to be curbed. It is high time that society stands together to do something, to understand what kind of wrongs mass hysteria can do.
Owners of media houses have told me that they felt disgraceful about going against Dhananjoy at that time. There were also a lot of rape cases happening and they wanted to make an example of him.

Would this incident, its coverage and the trial be treated differently now?
Yes, because we now have social media. But it can also swing both ways. We take our decisions quite hastily these days and we jump to conclusions. I was getting such wonderful compliments and then people said, I am a rapist because I am supporting a rapist. So this is our society. They are doing to me exactly what they did to Dhananjoy. But somewhere, I still have a lot of faith in the world and I think Dhananjoy would have got justice.
It seems the film has echoes of ‘Talvar', made about the 2008 Noida double murders. That movie reopened the case file and suggested a miscarriage of justice.
No, no. My film is a courtroom drama, something that has not happened in Bengali cinema for a long time. I had to debate the topic and the best way was to set it in a courtroom.
The debate part is fictional and the rest based on true events?
Yes. Based on people we met. Firstly, the story that we all know has been shown. The story that emerged during our research has also been shown. We have placed both stories to the audience in the form of a debate and we are asking the audience to make up its mind.
Have you also spoken to lawyers and police officers for your film?
Of course. They encouraged me a lot, right from top police officials and government officials to advocates.
You like to bring popular literary characters to the big screen, including Byomkesh Bakshi and Shabor. You seem comfortable with crime and investigative procedures.
I am intrigued by the dark side of human nature and psychology – I love to analyse. It's so easy to call somebody a criminal. But the psychology that goes towards making a criminal is another aspect. One of the dark characters in my film has been a victim of child sexual abuse, which kind of explains their criminal bent. Even if it is fictional, I like to deal with such subjects.
You have also been a co-producer and line producer for Hindi movies.
The first person who inspired me to become an actor was Anjan Dutt. We did the film The Bong Connection together, where I was the line producer. Later, Sujoy Ghosh came over to do Kahaani. At that time, Yash Raj Films was supposed to produce Kahaani. So the studio's vice president, Ashish Sen, came over to discuss the budget and I told them that I would be able to do the film within Rs 6-7 lakhs. They said it was impossible.
Then, of course, Yash Raj Films did not produce Kahaani. But Ashish told me that if I could pull off the film on this kind of budget, they would bring more films to me. We completed Kahaani in Rs 6.7 lakhs, and Ashish came back with Meri Pyaari Bindu.
HP has published the code of Enyo, the underlying JavaScript framework of the webOS platform. It is available from a public repository on GitHub and is distributed as open source software under the permissive Apache license. The release of Enyo is the first step in HP's plan to completely open the webOS mobile platform.
The webOS platform is built on top of Linux, but has a proprietary application stack that is made with HTML and JavaScript. HP obtained the platform in its 2010 acquisition of failing device manufacturer Palm. At the time, HP said it intended to ship the webOS software environment on a wide range of products, including tablets, printers, and desktop computers.
That ambitious vision for webOS was discarded when former CEO Leo Apotheker gutted the company's mobile product division as part of a broader change in strategy aimed at getting HP out of the consumer hardware market. Meg Whitman, who replaced Apotheker last year as CEO, reversed their controversial decision to spin off HP's Personal Systems Group. Salvaging webOS proved more difficult, however, after the costly fire sale of webOS product inventory.
Rumors that emerged in October indicated that HP was thinking about shuttering the entire platform and discontinuing development. At the time, we suggested that HP should open source the operating system instead of killing it. In December, HP announced plans to do exactly that: the company decided to open the operating system and continue maintaining it in collaboration with the open source software community.
Releasing a complex proprietary platform as open source requires a certain amount of time and effort. A governance model needs to be established and source code has to be audited in order to ensure that there are no potential licensing conflicts. HP made the excellent decision to start the process by opening Enyo, the JavaScript framework.
As we wrote in October, Enyo has considerable potential value as a stand-alone software project beyond the scope of webOS itself. The availability of the Enyo source code will make it practical for existing webOS developers to take their applications to other environments and make them work on top of other Web runtime environments.
In addition to opening the current stable version of Enyo, HP has also published the source code of the next-generation version of the framework, which is dubbed Enyo 2. The new version, which is still under active development, is being designed for greater portability. That means Enyo 2 will be better-suited for standalone use and adoption on non-mobile form factors.
"This initial open source release includes Enyo 1.0, which allows current developers of Enyo apps for webOS devices to distribute their apps to other platforms. While this release is not intended to be expanded any further, there is considerable utility for our current developer base in releasing it," HP's webOS strategy head Sam Greenblatt said in a statement. "Today's release also includes the core of Enyo 2.0, which will be the foundation for Enyo going forward. It expands Enyo's 'write once, run anywhere' capability to even more platforms, from mobile devices to desktop web browsers."
The Enyo 2 code available today is the frameworks's core, not the widget system and other higher-level components. Greenblatt says that those will be released "in the near future." The code that is available today is published on GitHub and will be maintained there going forward, which means that the community will be able to participate directly in the project.
HP has also launched an Enyo developer website with documentation and other resources. The initial release puts Enyo on a trajectory to compete with existing mobile JavaScript application frameworks like Sencha Touch and jQuery Mobile. As Enyo 2 evolves, the framework will be suitable for use in a more diverse range of environments.
Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Magic Johnson told the New York Post that New York Yankees free-agent Robinson Cano would likely be too expensive for their team.
Johnson's quote: “You can't have two guys, I mean, come on man, anybody who knows numbers. A year from now, two, here comes Hanley [Ramirez]. We've got guys we need to keep. When it is all said and done the numbers probably don't add up.''
The Dodgers, who won the National League West and lead the Atlanta Braves 1-0 in the Division Series, currently have a $235 million payroll and are on the hook for $165 million in guaranteed contracts next season, according to Cot's Baseball Contracts. Ramirez is slotted to make $16 million next season and then will become a free agent. The shortstop hit .345 this season.
More important for the Dodgers is signing All-Star pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who earned signed a two-year deal with the team before last season for $19 million, is eligible for arbitration after this season and becomes a free-agent after the 2014 season.
Cano is represented by Brodie Van Wagenen of CAA Sports under the umbrella of Jay-Z's Roc Nation. As I wrote last week, not only is the 10-year, $310 million Cano's reps are asking for too high, but even the seven-year, $161 million the Yankees are offering Cano is too rich.
A study by Ray C. Fair that looked at the relationship between performance–measured by on-base percentage (OBP) and OBP plus slugging percentage (OPS)–and age for major league baseball players from 1921 to 2004 indicates that Cano, who is 31, will produce sharply declining hitting numbers in a couple of years.
No matter how much money the Dodgers get from their new television deal with Time Warner Cable, Johnson is too smart to get bogged down with an Albert Pujols type contract.

More than 78 per cent of all PHP installations are running with at least one known security vulnerability, a researcher has found.
Google developer advocate Anthony Ferrara reached this unpleasant conclusion by correlating statistics from web survey site W3Techs with lists of known vulnerabilities in various versions of PHP.
What they found is that many, many PHP-powered websites are using insecure versions of the interpreter – so much so that it's actually easier to find an insecure PHP setup on the internet than a secure one.
"This is absolutely and unequivocally pathetic," Ferrara wrote.
The two most popular PHP releases, according to W3Techs' statistics, were versions 5.2.17 and 5.3.29. Together, they accounted for 24 per cent of the total – and both are insecure.
More to the point, Ferrara found that for each major version of PHP from 5.3 through 5.6, only a small number of minor versions are not known to contain any vulnerabilities, but most systems aren't running those secure versions.
In Ferrara's findings, 93.3 per cent of all PHP 5.6.x installs were insecure, 63.4 per cent of PHP 5.5.x installs were insecure, 89.6 per cent of PHP 5.4.x installs were insecure, and 66.1 per cent of PHP 5.3.x installs were insecure.
As for PHP 5.2, just write it off. No versions of that branch are considered secure.
Curiously, however, PHP 5.1 actually fared rather well. Fully 94.8 per cent of all PHP 5.1 installations were running a secure version, according to W3Techs' numbers. But never mind that – PHP 5.1 is nine years old, and only 1.2 per cent of the sites surveyed were still running it.
This isn't to say, of course, that none of the other software packages that power the internet contain vulnerabilities. Ferrara found that, similarly, 38 per cent of sites running the Apache web server were insecure, as were 36 per cent of sites running Nginx, 22 per cent of sites running Python, and 18 per cent of sites running Perl.
But PHP's astonishingly bad security record really took the cake in Ferrara's study. Add to that the applications that run on top of PHP – 55 per cent of Drupal installs had their own security bugs, as did 40 per cent of Wordpress installs – and you could almost say that any server running the language is just an exploit waiting to happen.
Unless, of course, you happen to be one of those happy few who are running an airtight version. The latest releases of PHP 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 are all thought to be secure.
"Check your installed versions," Ferrara urged. "Push for people to update. Don't accept 'if it works, don't fix it.' ... You have the power to change this, so change it. Security is everyone's problem. What matters is how you deal with it." ®
A row has broken out between the Law Society and the body representing motor insurance companies after Insurance Ireland published figures that it said showed legal fees from claimants has risen by 12% over a three-year period.
It published the figures in response to statements by the Law Society.
President of the Law Society Stuart Gilhooly described suggestions that rising legal fees had a role in the rising cost of motor insurance as lies.
They argued the legal profession was being blamed for doing its job of getting a fair deal for clients.
However, Insurance Ireland CEO Kevin Thompson published figures that they claimed brought much-needed accuracy to the debate.
The figures showed legal fees rose by €66m to €74m from 2013 to 2015 - an increase of 12 %.
The figures were supplied to an Oireachtas working group.
The group has made 40 recommendations to bring down the cost of motor insurance.
Earlier, the Oireachtas working group recommended that insurance companies should be compelled to ask motorists to produce an NCT certificate before offering cover,
The group has been tasked with taking steps to bring down the cost of motor insurance, which has been soaring by as much as 30% this year.
The group has made 40 recommendations and will publish a report next month.
Minister for State Eoghan Murphy, who chairs the group, confirmed that a commission would be established to benchmark compensation awards with payouts in other countries.
The commission also would investigate the establishment of a panel of medical experts for use in court.
The Cost of Insurance Working Group report recommends examining legal fees, which have been blamed for adding to personal injury awards.
It has called for a fully functioning insurance database to allow gardaí to check insurance compliance using automatic number plate recognition.
It also recommended an insurance database for insurance companies to detect fraud.
The group said that insurance companies should face a penalty if they fail to report claims data and it recommended that information about claims should be made available all insurance companies.
The working group has recommended examining the discount rate used by courts to set compensation awards.
The discount rate was recently changed to take account of the lower returns paid to investors and has resulted in increased awards.
The working group recommended maximising the Personal Injuries Assessment Board process.
It has also called for engagement with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to examine pricing models for vehicle repair in the event of an insurance claim.
It has called for the examination of the frequency of the publication of the Book of Quantum, which shows the average awards paid to crash victims.
There was a ten-year gap between the publication of the most recent book this year and the previous edition.
It also proposed phasing out paper based insurance discs following the introduction of a real time database of motor insurance.
Out of Africa
Around 100,000 years ago humans left Africa, where they originated, and gradually spread north and east into Europe and Asia. Between 50,000 and 25,000 BC, using simple rafts, people gradually dispersed through the large islands of South-East Asia. Eventually they reached Australia and New Guinea, which were then connected by land.
About 3,200 years ago people sailed south-east from the Solomon Islands further into the Pacific Ocean, and settled most of the islands of Melanesia. Between 1200 and 1000 BC they spread rapidly to Fiji and West Polynesia, including Tonga and Samoa.
The last Pacific migrations were to the distant points of Polynesia – Hawaii (600 AD), Easter Island (700 AD) and New Zealand (1250–1300 AD). Evidence that they reached South America several centuries before Europeans did so is inconclusive.
While this sequence seems rather straightforward, the exact dates and the order of settlement are debated. Experts often disagree, and there are competing theories. The date for the arrival of people in New Zealand is no exception.
Reaching New Zealand
New Zealand was one of the last habitable land masses to be settled. Migrants sailed in double-hulled canoes from East Polynesia – the last major voyages in the exploration and settlement of the Pacific Islands.
Many methods have been used to determine the date when they first arrived, and when they settled. Although no single method is foolproof, all show remarkable agreement that permanent Polynesian settlement was established around 1300.
As contract negotiations remain relatively quiet on the Nerlens Noel front, news has filtered in that the 23-year old big man is shuffling the deck — reorganizing their representation off the court.
After failing to secure a lucrative restricted contract offer of their liking, Noel has decided to part ways with their now “former” agent Happy Walters.
This shouldn't come as too big of a surprise. Athletes switch agents all the time. Heck, Andrew Wiggins, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski, has split from their agent Bill Duffy even after securing a $148 million dollar max offer.
Anyhow, news broke Monday afternoon that Noel will be taking their talents to Klutch Sports and will be represented by one of the games most recognizable agents, Rich Paul. This was first reported by Michael Scotto of Basketball Insiders.
The pairing makes total sense. Rich Paul gets their clients paid. With Noel reportedly seeking a substantial contract offer near or at maximum dollars — Rich Paul will serve as the workhorse within the negotiating room. The hope has to be on the Noel front is that Paul will be able to do what Walter couldn't, obtain a contract worth Noel's while.
Paul is one of the NBA's toughest negotiators out there. I'd be surprised if they made the Mavericks life easy. He's held players out (Tristan Thompson & J.R Smith) up until they and their client get what they want. Much to Paul's credit, their track record is consistent, whenever they are brokering deals with teams, those deals always tend to be above the projected market. If you don't want to pay Rich Paul's client, then Rich Paul will make your life tough. What Rich Paul & their clients want, Rich Paul and their clientele usually get.
According to the Agency database over at DraftExpress, Paul has garnered over $231,918,443 million dollars in total guaranteed salaries between their 15 clients. It helps to have clients like LeBron James & John Wall on your team, two players that will command the max no matter what. But Paul has done a superb job at getting every last penny from teams on deals involving Eric Bledsoe, Tristan Thompson, and J.R. Smith. They even managed to get $10.6 Million out of Memphis to pay Ben McLemore.
Yes, they may have miscalculated the Kenatvious Caldwell-Pope situation this summer, but with Nerlens Noel now in the fold, you better think he's going to try to make up for that miscalculation. It's pretty simple, whoever Paul represents — one thing is for certain, players get paid and paid well.
That's what brings us to Dallas. On the surface, this doesn't bode too well for the Mavericks, who through their actions this summer, look to be extra cautious with each and every dollar spent. Having salary cap flexibility is at a premium in this ever changing league right now. Very few teams could have the cap space the Mavericks project to have next summer.
So what are their options with Noel?
It's evident that the center position is in flux. The NBA is becoming a position-less game. LeBron and Kevin Durant played heavy minutes at the 5 in this year's finals. Those are two players that can do everything out on the floor. As the game continues to evolve to a smaller and smaller sport it appears that in order to have high success you need playmakers and shooters at every position. Do the Mavericks really want to fork over $23+ million dollars annually to a player that hasn't been able to consistently stay healthy and to a player that also could potentially be an offensive liability due to a lack of jump shot?
The Mavericks found that perfect roster construction formula back in 2011 when they won the championship. Can a roster like that win in today's game?
It's known around the team that they feel Nerlens can be their younger Tyson Chandler, a defensive force that protects the rim & helps to space on the offensive side of the ball as the rim-running pick-and-roll dive man. Is that player worth premium dollar? That's Donnie Nelson & their front office's job to find out.
We now sit 54 days within the free agency period. As much as the Noel process has battled the patience of the fans, inserting Paul into the negotiations will certainly test the Mavericks owner Mark Cuban & their front office. Will Mark Cuban have to reach back and dig out a few extra million dollars to ensure the Mavericks secure their center of the future? That question became a lot more likely now that Rich Paul & Klutch Sports has entered the negotiating room.
So for now, Noel's contract negotiations look to be at a standstill but don't be surprised by the start of the season, he's either in street clothes or one of the highest paid centers in the league — all thanks to Rich Paul.
Professional staging can help move difficult-to-sell homes, and is used extensively in Vancouver's red-hot real estate market, despite low inventory and multiple offers.
Vancouver's Trump International Hotel & Tower has faced more than its fair share of controversy, mostly because of building's name. It turns out that being associated with now-U.S. President Donald Trump isn't as good of an idea as it seemed a couple years ago.
Many of the condo units in the tower are now being flipped on the resale market, a common situation in recently-completed buildings. These units are not your ordinary condo or apartment though. The building is very high-end, and units feature bathrooms clad in marble, integrated European appliances, and spectacular views.
Residents have exclusive access to a chauffeured Rolls-Royce and even time on a private jet. Units currently for sale range from just under $1 million for a 607 sq. ft. one bedroom unit, to $4 million for a 1,500 sq. ft. two bedroom unit.
So it's a little surprising that one such listing, high up on the 66th floor, is staged like this:
6602-1151 West Georgia Street (Update: interior photos have since been removed from MLS) is currently listed for the eye-watering price of $3,325,000, plus GST and property transfer tax (about $300,000).
The 1,231 sq. ft. two bedroom, three bathroom unit features air conditioning, Gaggenau appliances, and an integrated home automation system.
No word on whether or not the furniture can be worked into the deal.
Many homeowners credit staging with the quick sale of their homes, reporting that they received multiple offers after their units were staged. There are several companies offering staging services in Vancouver, with costs depending on the size of the unit and the furniture desired.
It's safe to say the owners of this particular suite probably didn't budget for it.
Nearly three years ago, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Apple's marketing of in-app purchases to children. The issue was that when users entered their iTunes password in the App Store, iOS wouldn't ask for the password again for 15 minutes—enabling the easy purchase of virtual items, particularly by kids. Earlier this year, Ars reported an instance where a five-year-old ran up a $2,500 charge.
“As a result, we have alleged that in aggregate, children ran up millions of dollars in charges without [parents'] knowledge or consent,” FTC Commissioner Edith Ramirez told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday.
Ramirez announced that in a 3-1 vote, the FTC had settled the issue with Apple , requiring that Apple provide refunds. The payments must reach a “$32 million price floor, and if it comes to less, then Apple will pay the rest to the FTC.”
Ramirez added that the problem was Apple's lack of informed consent of this 15-minute window and the possibility of racking up easy charges during that time.
“Apple is required to send out an e-mail to potentially affected consumers,” they said.
Fair's fair?
For its part, Cupertino softened accusations of wrongdoing in an e-mail sent from Apple CEO Tim Cook and leaked to the media. Cook wrote that the company had already e-mailed millions of App Store customers and is processing 37,000 claims.
A federal judge agreed with our actions as a full settlement and we felt we had made things right for everyone. Then, the FTC got involved and we faced the prospect of a second lawsuit over the very same issue. It doesn't feel right for the FTC to sue over a case that had already been settled. To us, it smacked of double jeopardy. However, the consent decree the FTC proposed does not require us to do anything we weren't already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight.
In response to a question on the conference call posed by Ars, Ramirez asserted that the FTC's new settlement is “more robust” than the previous civil case. It will newly require Apple, as of March 31, 2014, to “change its practices so there is notice given to account holders and parents so they understand the 15-minute window.”
“Our criteria is that there be informed consent before a charge is made,” they concluded.
The lone dissent in the FTC's vote came from Commissioner Joshua D. Wright, who said that this case involves a "miniscule percentage of consumers" and therefore did not meet the FTC's own analysis for "unfairness."
Wright argued (PDF):
MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte saw their trust rating decrease by 5 percentage points, from 91 percent in July to 86 percent in September, according to the latest survey by Pulse Asia.
Results of the nationwide "Ulat ng Bayan" survey released on Wednesday showed a more pronounced "ambivalence toward presidential performance in their first three months in office."
Respondents who are undecided about Duterte's performance jumped from 8 percent to 11 percent, while more also said they distrust the country's leader. Expression of distrust increased from 0.2 percent around the time of their inauguration in July to 3 percent in September.
The nationwide survey is based on a sample of 1,200 representative adults 18 years old and above with a 3 percent margin of error.
While still trusted by the majority, Duterte lost most percentage points in Metro Manila, where their rating dropped to 81 percent from a record 92 percent.
There are more representative respondents in the capital region—at 6 percent—who said they distrust the president. In comparison, there was virtually no expression of distrust in July when the survey was conducted.
Apart from Metro Manila, Duterte also lost trust ratings across all geographical sectors and socio-economic groupings since July.
RELATED: Duterte maintains 'excellent' trust ratings, says SWS
The Pulse Asia report, however, noted that the decline in Duterte's national trust score is "not considered significant," since the marginal movement in the score still falls within the +/-3 percentage points.
"Appreciation for their work and trust in them are sentiments expressed by most Filipinos (86%) toward President Rodrigo R. Duterte," the pollster said in the report. — Infographic by Jonathan Asuncion

Irix 15mm f/2.4 full frame lens design and distortion and MTF charts:
Press release:
Meet the Irix 15mm f/2.4. The photographers dream. Built by engineers and perfected by designers.
The new ultra wide-angle, rectilinear manual lens designed for DSLR cameras guarantees exceptional optical performance.
The Irix 15mm f/2.4 lens is designed to deliver the best optical performance and match full frame DSLR cameras demands. Providing a focal length of 15mm, this new lens model is ideal for outdoor and indoor photography whether it is photojournalism, landscapes or architecture.
From 19 to 22 March, during The Photography Show in Birmingham, TH Swiss will be premiering new family of lenses. Visit Irix at Stand No F121.
Innovative technology
Combining capabilities specific to analogue photography with ingenious technology and solutions, the Irix 15mm f/2.4 is the perfect tool for both professionals and hobbyists. The new special features such as focus lock, infinity click and hyperfocal scale set a new level of manual lens functionality. Focus lock enables to lock the focus ring at any time enssuring the chosen settings. Hyperfocal distance scale gives information about the accessible range for depth of field for a given aperture simply and intuitively. When the focusing ring is set in the “infinity” position, there is a noticeable “click” (infinity click), making it easier to find the value without looking.
Extraordinary optical performance
The Irix 15mm f/2.4 meets the most demanding requirements of modern cameras. Thanks to sophisticated optical construction and special neutrino coating, colour aberration, ghosting and flare effects have been reduced to the absolute minimum, so the lens is ready to meet the requirements of the 50+ megapixel sensors of the newest cameras.
The complex optical system consist of 15 elements in 11 groups. Three of the lens elements have a high refractive index and two others have been made from extra-low dispersion glass. The construction also contains two glass aspherical lenses that are responsible for extremely high image quality and improving image brightness at edges, while minimizing distortions and aberrations at the same time.
With a minimum focusing distance of 0.28 metre and 9 rounded shaped aperture blades, the lens stands for supremely smooth out-of-focus areas. Working with a narrow depth of field it allows the user to fully enjoy the bokeh effect.
Resistant to extreme conditions
Irix 15mm f/2.4 lenses are made with extreme precision, allowing them to be used in even the harshest weather conditions. Each lens is equipped with a weather sealed construction that protects the interior against dust and moisture. Thanks to inner seals they are also protected from accidental water splashes.
Prepare for more and create
Despite its short focal length and large aperture, the Irix 15mm f/2.4 is equipped with not only a front filter mount, but also has a rear gelatin filter slot. The design of the lens allows the use of 95 mm screw-in filters at the front in the petal-shape lens hood and gelatin filters at the back of the lens. This ensures unlimited possibilities for image creation.
Personalize your view
For the comfort of our customers Irix has created two versions of the Irix 15mm f/2.4 to meet their personality and individual taste.
Irix Blackstone: classic design meets maximum functionality, achieving the perfect match of innovative technology. The durable aluminium and magnesium body ensures foolproof protection of your lens, even in extreme conditions. Engraved fluorescent markings that reflect the light enable easy operation in all lighting conditions.
Irix Firefly: high quality mechanism in a handy design. Ergonomic focusing ring offers the freedom to capture the most ideal moment, whether it is big city architecture or wildlife scenery. The most lightweight lens in its class. Challenge accepted.
Irix Swiss Design
Irix Swiss Design stands for minimalism in style while maintaining maximum functionality. It is a perfect mixture of European design combined with Korean precision. The same look and feel of all products in the Irix family. The same consistency, product packaging and complementary elements, all perfectly shaped and fitting one another.
Ultimate precision
Each Irix 15mm f/2.4 lens leaving the factory has been properly calibrated. However, the focus calibration function provides the unique opportunity to adjust the focusing scale for a particular model of camera.
I had better start out by admitting what a self-serving topic I've chosen. My books are consummately flawed. They're Baryshnikovs dancing in chain mail, ninjas fumbling with bifocals. I am thus about as suited to write this essay as, say, Naomi Novik would be to write “Daring to Add Dragons to Napeleonic Warfare” or Joe Hill, “Daring to Scare ‘Em Silly.”
All the same this is a cry from the heart. I want more imperfection in fantasy, and particularly in epic fantasy. Not just any sort of imperfection, of course: I want the kind that results from immense aspiration, deeply felt material, difficult or disturbing terrain. In a word: risk. We see few truly risky books anymore, and in an important sense I think our own professionalism is to blame.
Writers can still be pretty naughty (just stay up late enough at the next big con). But compared to the rogues of yesteryear we are almost embarrassingly well-behaved. Overall this is not a bad thing. American writing in the 20th century lost more than it gained by turning writers into two-bit prophets, cult kings and goatish gurus. It was an unhealthy worship. It tied some writers up in knots of self-regard, and whispered to others that they could live as pigs and be praised for it. Not long ago an editor told me of their younger days at a major university. Their job had been to make sure every visiting Great Man of Letters was attended by a lovely undergraduate woman, bedazzled enough by their Greatness to prove it in bed.
No, we don't need the good old days. If we've growing up a bit as writers—meeting the occasional deadline, listening now and then to critique—so much the better. But professionalism too has a dark side. It helps us finish our stories, but it doesn't help us find them. Today we make a conscious thing of our writing, compartmentalizing the challenges and honing our various skills as conscientiously as future Olympians in the gym. We shape worlds. We think through magic. We keep our prose nimble, dance through points of view, master questions of timing and suspense. We know the how as never before, but we're in danger of losing our grip on the why, and even the what. Novels are—entertainments? Certainly. Inventions? Yup. Stories too long to read in one sitting? Usually. Challenges put quietly to the reader's soul?
Um. Ah. Gotta go now. You're weirding me out.
We all know what makes “a good read.” Some elements, like those above, we can train ourselves to produce on demand. Others we must chase, like bright, sassy birds. The latter include coolness, irony, “attitude,” the essential twist, the careful darting beyond the reader's moral comfort zone (far enough to shock, but never to appall). You need all these skills, but don't worry—you can have them. They're for sale. The old chestnut informs us that writing can't be taught, but that is guff. Writing is taught everywhere, endlessly, like plumbing and architecture. Writing instruction is a massive business, and it thrives because it works.
Up to a point.
Because what can't be taught are the furious intangibles. Vision. Benediction. Existential terror. Deep wonder. Aching need. These are not for sale. These things—however secular your orientation—you must pray for.
Or else not bother with. That's the safer path. In a time when we are expected to fight over that shrinking pie called public notice, not bothering with the vision thing is the choice of many. And who can blame them? Thousands of architects leave school each year ready to build houses—safe, square houses, perfect houses—and if they want to feed their children they'd best build lots of them, and quickly. They may be faceless, interchangeable houses. But they will certainly be bought. And if one day houses are declared impractical, they'll build apartment blocks.
The problem is that novels do not want to be mere cells in a great grey tower. This is true above all with fantasy. We don't come looking for prudence or practicality, the next well-built home. We want the next Himeji Castle.
Many of us want the castle desperately—so desperately that when we fail to find it, we settle for the thirtieth-floor apartment cell, because at least it offers altitude, windows facing the river, a distant view of our dreams.
About now you may be wondering who I intend to skewer in this essay. The answer is no one. My house may be made of a different sort of glass, but it's glass all the same. Besides, I love everyone. I hug people, even here in New England. And I mean to keep it that way.
But let's take the opposite approach, and think about some classics. What would become of them today? Nearly every one displays the kind of imperfections that contemporary writers would labor like Hercules to avoid. Let me start with two of my favorites.
EXHIBIT A: The Left Hand Of Darkness. Le Guin's Hugo & Nebula-winning masterpiece is a complex vision of a world of hermaphrodites, locked in an ice age, being propelled towards war for the first time in its history. It is also a platonic love story, a tundra survival tale, a pastiche novel, and one or two other disgustingly well-executed things. But above all it is an exercise in message control. Inspired by the Tao Te Ching, this novel gives you Tao coming and going: the mutual dependence of light and dark, male and female, human and nature, reason and instinct. The salvation to be found in embracing one's opposite. The hopelessness of seeking absolute. On and on, until even the most charmed reader may be stifling a scream.
This pounding of a theme is probably le Guin's signature flaw. But it is also their glory. Every one of their book has its deep thinkers, and what thoughts they have! Never, ever, do they go through the motions of intellect. Them people struggle, face crises of philosophy and belief. You can feel yourself getting wiser by the page.
Today le Guin (a young, nobody, just-starting-out le Guin) would be encouraged to toss out most of that. To make it simpler, shallower. Thinking's fine, my dear—as long as it doesn't slow you down. Give us the kind of thinking one can splash about in. Nobody wants to get in up to their neck.
EXHIBIT B: The Lord of the Rings. We all know what's wrong with Tolkien: no women, no sex, no doubt as to the utter evil of the hordes, no end to the landscape descriptions. Very well. Guilty as charged. The most beloved epic fantasy since Homer is a mess.
But just imagine the disaster if someone had persuaded Tolkien to tinker—to correct those flaws. That someone might have been their survival-minded editor Stanley Unwin, or C.S. Lewis, or their wife, or someone they wished had been their wife. Today the list might also include a marketing team. Just imagine the well-meaning advice. Lose the elvish, lose the birthday party, lose the talking trees! Man those hobbits up! You can't seriously expect us to publish twelve hundred pages about some helpless, hairy gnomes! Cut the travel-talk. And for God's sake, let Aragorn and this Arwen babe get their hands on each other. Couldn't they hook up in Chapter Three?
Any and all of these “improvements” might have been urged upon Tolkien (the rookie Tolkien, the nobody) if they had written The Lord of the Rings today. They might well have been given as preconditions for being taken seriously, let alone published.
Don't misunderstand me: I would never argue the impossibility of an improved LOTR. Even the films succeed in doing so, here and there. Peter Jackson brings Eowyn to life in a way Tolkien never attempts, and makes Boromir into a man whose pain is raw and inescapable, rather than a gruff cipher we are rather glad to be done with.
But what if Tolkien had tried to be “perfect?” What if they had possessed a checklist, rather than a collection of manias and obsessions? Take the running travelogue—that crazed, impossibly precise description of every blessed dell and dingle and crevasse. Yes, it is excessive—by that pragmatic reckoning which sells books even as it neuters them. It is also the very substance of their greatness. It is what happened on the page when they conjured Middle Earth. No other gift of Tolkien's outshines this almost superhumanly sustained act of imagining. No other epic in history does it better.
There is no end to examples like the two above. Take the great American epic fantasy, Moby Dick. You may remember its genius—but do you recall its unreadability? The book is laughably overstuffed. It is also mesmerizing, transcendent. Writing of Ahab and Starbuck, Melville observes that “there is wisdom that is woe, but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls, that can alive dive into the blackest gorges and sail out of them again, to become invisible in the sunny spaces.' Moby Dick does just that, astonishingly well. And yet it's a shipwreck. And yet it's not.
Think of Lolita. A monstrous book. Nabokov's snobbish, flowery, pretentious, self-loving, self-loathing and (lest we forget) pedophilic hero is at once horrible and—for the very same reasons—irresistible. Think of One Hundred Years of Solitude, yet another kind of epic fantasy. Hilarious and tragic, surreal and razor-sharp, absurd in particulars and utterly true in its portrait of loss and the fragility of consciousness.
Think, finally, of Dune.
Now, I want to believe that even today, an editor presented with Dune would sign Frank Herbert in a heartbeat. Probably they would: the book is close to the adventure-story ideal. That, of course, is my point: it is close, but not exactly the ideal. It doesn't hit the bullseye with a splat. The parts that deviate from perfection—all that questionable philosophical mumbo-jumbo, the irate little lessons voiced by one character after another—are not just baggage. They're essential. They elevate a rip-roaring adventure into a sublime and awe-inspiring one. They spark the latent wonder of it all into vibrant, multidimensional life.
But to include them was, of course, a risk. All that thick, compulsive musing could have gone too far, wrecking Dune as it did (for this reader) every one of the sequels. Logically, Herbert should have played it safe. They should have clipped their own wings, handed us a grand adventure and denied us a masterpiece.
Of course sometimes the adventure is all we want. I am not calling for us to live on broccoli alone. I eat popcorn too, and occasionally read it. There's no reason whatsoever to condemn books that offer only the expected thrill, the requisite exoticism, the standard heroic caper. There is also little cause to praise them, debate them, enroll in workshops to emulate them, or in truth to talk about them much at all. They're just here, like the squirrels we smile at while crossing the park. Wildlife, you could call them. And they eat popcorn too.
But what is that, crawling out of the river at the edge of the park? A giant lizard, an alligator? A megalosaurus? You there, leave your picnic, run! Good lord, it is eating a Pomeranian! It's so hideous…or do I mean beautiful? Is that intelligence in its eyes? Does it see me? Has anything ever looked at me this way before?
We may not find answers to these questions, but we'll never forget the creature that provoked them. It will stay with us, haunt our dreams, give us a story to tell our children about. Those are the stories I dream of. That's the wildlife I go looking for in books.

LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambian wildlife authorities said on Tuesday they had suspended the controlled slaughter of up to 2,000 hippos over the next five years following concerns from animal rights activists who described it as trophy hunting.
Zambia's Department of National Parks and Wildlife said it started the hippo culling after new research showed that the water levels in Luangwa river were “low and insufficient to support the hippo population, especially in the dry season.”
Zambia has between 42,000 and 50,000 hippos, a population the Department of National Parks and Wildlife says cannot be supported by the water levels in the Luangwa valley where most of the animals are located.
British wildlife charity Born Free said on its web site that the scientific rationale for killing up to 2,000 hippos when their population in the entire southern Africa region stood at 80,000 hippos was questionable.
“I urge the authorities to call a halt to the killing with immediate effect,” Born Free President and Co-Founder, Will Travers said in a post on the charity's website.
Water levels in Zambia's rivers and lakes have dropped following a prolonged drought that threatens crops across the Southern African region where the United Nations has warned that 14 million people face hunger.

A state in west India has ruled that children must not carry to school a bag that exceeds more than 10% of their weight in a bid to prevent injury.
Officials in Maharashtra warned that heavy satchels were tiring children and damaging their spines and joints.
Teachers are being asked to weigh students' bags at school but the state has not specified a punishment.
Indian children are often under immense pressure to succeed, carrying extra study materials from class to class.
"We have found bags that weigh 20% to 30% [of the children's bodyweight] due to thick notebooks, textbooks, unrequired stationery and even cosmetics," wrote Nand Kumar in the executive order seen by the AFP news agency.
Schools are requested to provide clean drinking water and food, as well as provide more storage space for books.
"I am happy to know that now we will be carrying a lighter school bag," one student told the Daily News & Analysis.
"Initially, after school, I had no energy to play or study; but now I will be happy walking home with a lighter bag."
That the Afghan campaign lacks a clear strategy, has been politically misdirected and militarily under-resourced, and is essentially unwinnable as presently conceived is something the British public, like its counterparts in the US and western Europe, has increasingly suspected. Opinion polls in most Nato countries show strengthening opposition to the western alliance's longest ever war.
The war logs, an official accounting of murderous missions, tragic incompetence and abject failure from 2004-2009, put factual flesh on the bare bones of these negative perceptions. Their publication may further undermine public support just as the campaign supposedly reaches a "critical" juncture following June's record casualties and the sacking of General Stanley McChrystal.
The White House's defence – that this serial bungling occurred on George Bush's watch – appears problematic. Since Barack Obama concluded a policy review last December and decided on a "surge" of 30,000 additional troops, overall levels of violence have risen further while confusion about counterinsurgency strategy and the exit timetable has deepened.
"Obama has had several opportunities to reassess US goals and interests and in each instance they have chosen to escalate," said Richard Haass, a former senior Bush administration official and president of the council on foreign relations. "Today the counterinsurgency strategy that demanded all those troops is clearly not working." Afghanistan was now Obama's war, Haass said, and they were losing it. "It's time to scale down our ambitions and reduce and redirect what we do."
American and therefore British aims have already been pared down considerably. Less is heard these days about institution-building, transparent, corruption-free governance and grandiose infrastructure projects. Talk of "victory" over the Taliban has been replaced by furtive talk of talks. The war aims of the world's most powerful military alliance have now boiled down to three fingers-crossed wishes: create a relatively stable, self-governing state, ensure it no longer harbours al-Qaida, and then get the hell out of Dodge.
The appointment of the Iraq war hero, General David Petraeus, as McChrystal's replacement, has so far only compounded the confusion about how even these modest objectives can be reached. Though they will not say so in public, Petraeus, as head of US central command (Centcom), did not support Obama's July 2011 deadline for beginning US troop withdrawals.
At their congressional confirmation hearing, Petraeus indicated they favoured a troop-intensive strategy (as in Iraq) and would privately press for more time and a slower withdrawal schedule that will keep most of the troops in Afghanistan for longer. Petraeus is in the driving seat and Obama knows it. After twin fiascos over McChrystal and their predecessor, General David McKiernan (also fired by Obama), they are virtually unsackable. What they want they will most probably get.
Trouble is, it's uncertain Petraeus knows themselves when it comes to the specifics. They want more emphasis on training up Afghan army and police to take over security responsibilities. But contradicting previous forecasts, Petraeus's aides say they do not believe the Afghans will be ready this year.
Petraeus wants to give more responsibility to friendly tribal leaders, as they did in Iraq's Sunni triangle; President Hamid Karzai opposes the idea, saying it will encourage warlordism. Petraeus says they want to amend rules of engagement, giving US forces (who have been complaining they are hamstrung) a freer hand to call in air strikes and artillery when under fire. At the same time, they say they remain committed to minimising civilian casualties.
And Petraeus looks likely to pursue the expansion of the war into Pakistan's tribal areas, already subject to an increasing number of drone attacks and the occasional special forces incursion. The numbers of US troops based in Pakistan is small but growing. As strategists such as Haass put it, "Pakistan is much more important than Afghanistan". Losing nuclear-armed Pakistan to the jihadis is a recurring (if exaggerated) Pentagon nightmare.
All of these uncertainties, created, evolving or exacerbated on Obama's watch, are overshadowed by the greatest imponderable of all: when, how and if the US can bring itself to talk to the Taliban and its allies, as urged by Britain, Pakistan and other allies who believe a negotiated settlement is the only way out.
On this crucial subject, the Obama administration appears divided. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairperson of the US joint chiefs of staff, insisted in Kabul this week that additional military pressure will turn the tide by year's end – Nato's stated target. But senior US officials and, for example Obama's regional envoy, Richard Holbrooke, appear more open to discussion. Meanwhile influential voices are lobbying for a leaner, slimmed down strategy.
"The next six months will be a crucial time for a thoughtful (but ground-based) reappraisal of our approach," said a senior former US government official. "We need to settle on the necessary but cost-effective level of effort for counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, capacity building, regional co-operation and restraint."
The war logs looked back over the last six years of the war. Looking forward, there seems little reason so far to be believed that lessons have been learned or that anything fundamental in the American approach has changed. But not to worry. Obama is having another policy review in December.

This is an exercise in historicization. This lecture concerns the relation between feminism, the movements of second-wave feminism, and the recent history of capitalism. My aim is to try to shed some light on where the feminist movement stands today in the current crisis of capitalism.
So, I want to tell a story that has essentially three parts, each of which corresponds to a moment in a recent history of capitalism. The first moment concerns the beginnings of second-wave feminism in the context of what I'm going to call “state-organized capitalism,” and here I want to chart the emergence of second-wave feminism out of the anti-imperialist New Left, posing a radical challenge to the pervasive androcentrism and sexism of state-organized capitalism. That's the first moment.
Second, I want to look at the process of feminism's subsequent development in a dramatically changed social context of rising neoliberalism. Here, I want to look not only at the movement's undeniable and extraordinary successes but also at the disturbing convergence of some of its ideals with the demands of this new form of capitalism, post-Fordist, disorganized, transnational. Here, I want to pose the question whether second-wave feminism has unwittingly supplied a key element of what Boltanski and Chiapello call the New Spirit, “Le Nouvel esprit du capitalisme.”
Finally, in a third moment, I want to consider a possible reorientation of feminism today in the present context of capitalist crisis and political realignment at least in the United States, which could — let me emphasize could, it's not guaranteed, but could — mark the beginnings of a shift away from neoliberalism to some new form of social organization. So, in this third moment, I want to examine the prospects for reactivating feminism's emancipatory promise in a world that is now being rocked by the twin crises.
OK, so, three moments in the history of capitalism — state-organized capitalism, neoliberalism, and the present crisis of capitalism. How can we understand the recent history of feminism in relation to each of those three moments? In a nutshell, I want to give you a sort of summary of this argument, my hypothesis here. I'm going to argue that what was truly new about the second wave was the way in which it wove together, in a critique of androcentric state-organized capitalism, what we can today understand as three analytically distinct dimensions of gender injustice: an economic dimension, a cultural dimension, and, now I want to add, an additional third political dimension. Second-wave feminism, in other words, subjected state-organized capitalism to a wide-ranging, multi-faceted scrutiny in which those three dimensions of critique intermingled freely. In this way, feminists generated a critique that was simultaneously ramified and systematic. In the ensuing decades, however — this corresponds to my second moment, the neoliberal moment — the three dimensions of critique became separated — from one another and, equally importantly, from the critique of capitalism. With the fragmentation of the feminist critique came the selective incorporation and partial recuperation of some of its strands by neoliberalism. Split off from one another, in other words, and from the societal critique, the anti-capitalist critique that had integrated them, second-wave hopes were conscripted in the service of the project that was deeply at odds with the larger, holistic feminist vision of a just society. In a fine instance of what I'm calling here the cunning of history, utopian desires found a second life as currents that legitimated the transition to a new form of capitalism. This is the Boltanski-Chiapello argument but now adapted to this feminist argument.
So, I'm going to then elaborate this argument, as I said in three steps — first by reconstructing the second-wave feminist critique of androcentric state-organized capitalism as integrating concerns that I associate today with three perspectives of justice, which I have called redistribution, recognition, and representation. Secondly, I want to sketch the coming apart of that constellation and the selective enlistment of some of its strands to legitimate neoliberal capitalism. And, third, I want to try to weigh the prospects of recovering feminism's emancipatory promise today, in this present moment of economic crisis and possible political opening.

Empire examines the rise and role of the new oligarchs and the decline of democracy in the United States and beyond.
Wealth inequality has risen to stratospheric heights. The statistics, the real statistics, sound like fragments spun off from a madman's dream.
Eighty-five people have as much money as three and a half billion other people. Look at it like this: 85 people = 3,500,000,000 people.
Forbes Magazine, which used to gleefully refer to itself as a “capitalist tool,” creates an annual list of the richest 400 people in the world. Ten years ago, their combined wealth was $1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion dollars). Now, after a world wide crash and all sort of bailouts, their combined worth is $2,000,000,000,000. They have doubled their money. How have you done?
Did their money come to them because the magic of the market realised how ultra-special talented they were? Or because of power? Manipulating laws, buying politicians, even taking over governments. Has the power of money in the United States grown so great that democracy is just a charade? A large, frenetic, incredibly expensive one, but still, just play-acting and a dumb show for the public?
While all the real decisions come from a small group of the ultra-wealthy, to some degree very consciously, but to an even larger degree by the sheer weight of their incredible wealth, the Oligarchs.
That much money, it has to be about power.
Judiciary Committee chairperson requests special counsel to investigate CIA rendition RAW STORY
Published: Thursday July 10, 2008
Print This Email This BREAKING 4:02 PM ET // FROM A HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RELEASE..... House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Subcommittee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and Foreign Affairs Chairman of the International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight Subcommittee, Bill Delahunt (D-MA), today called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special counsel to investigate the rendition of a Canadian citizen, Maher Arar, to Syria. Returning home to Canada in September 2002, Mr. Arar was detained at JFK airport in New York based on false intelligence suggesting ties to terrorist activity. Despite finding that they would likely be subject to torture, Mr. Arar was then removed to Syria at the direction of the Commissioner of the INS and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. Mr. Arar was subsequently imprisoned for nearly a year and tortured. In June, the former Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Clark Ervin testified before a joint Judiciary and Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing that they believed that U.S. officials intended to render Mr. Arar to Syria, rather than allowing them to continue on to Canada, because of the likelihood that they would be tortured in Syria. Upon Mr. Arar's return to Canada in 2003, the Canadian government conducted an exhaustive investigation concluding that no evidence linked Mr. Arar to terrorist groups or suggested a security threat and awarded them nearly $10 million in damages. The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducted its own four-year investigation into the matter, yet its investigators lacked subpoena authority and were frequently stymied by numerous privilege claims. "Mr. Arar's rendition to Syria, with the knowledge they would be subject to torture, demands a thorough investigation into the conduct of the Department of Justice and U.S. immigration officials," said Conyers. "Given the involvement of high-ranking administration officials in this matter, and the stonewalling encountered in the DHS Inspector General's investigation, the appointment of a special counsel is clearly necessary." "The Inspector Generals public report reveals that Administration officials sent Mr. Arar to Syria knowing that they likely would be tortured," said Rep. Nadler. "This is at odds with everything we stand for as a free and just nation, and the Administrations unwillingness to expose how and why this happened has fueled public concern and criticism. We urge Attorney General Mukasey to appoint an outside special counsel to investigate Mr. Arars case to ensure a fair investigation is conducted to examine these serious allegations of wrongdoing." "The startling revelation that attorneys within the Office of the Deputy Attorney General were intimately involved in this case is sufficient cause for an outside review," said Delahunt. "This is the only way to make sure that those who had a hand in Mr. Arars rendition to torture will be held accountable." The full text of the correspondence may be found here.
Dogecoin Price Key Highlights
Dogecoin price after completing our highlighted double top pattern moved lower and created a new low Intraday below 58.0
There were many spikes noted on the upside and downside which leaves the price in a range.
It looks like both buyers and sellers are in action, which is causing a lot of swing moves.
Dogecoin price moved lower during this past week, but buyers managed to defend sharp losses and pushed it back higher.
Trend Line Support Area
As highlighted in this past week's analysis, there was a major downside reaction noted in the Dogecoin price. There was a double top pattern on the hourly chart that paved the way for more losses in the near term. The price fell sharply and traded below an important support area of 60.0 Satoshis, and even traded below another support area of 58.0 Satoshis.
A new low is formed around 57.7 Satoshis, and buyers appeared around the stated level and prevented the downside. There was a sharp upside reaction noted which took the price above the 100 hourly simple moving average. There were many swing moves noted up and down, which looks like a choppy price action. Currently, there is a support trend line formed on the hourly chart, which is acting as a barrier for sellers. If the price moves higher from the current levels, then it might find hurdle around the 100 hourly SMA. Any further gains might be limited around a crucial resistance area of 64.0 Satoshis.
On the downside, the last swing low of 57.7 Satoshis is acting as a support area. A break below it might be critical in the near term.
Intraday Support Level – 57.0 Satoshis
Intraday Resistance Level – 63.0 Satoshis
The hourly RSI and MACD are positioned in the negative zone.

'We're fighting a massive monster across the water' - Financial difficulties in the League of Ireland
Footballers plying their trade in Irish domestic football attest to the hardships of sustaining a career when finances are far from certain
COMMENT
By Ronan Murphy
Since the birth of the English Premier League, the League of Ireland has found it difficult to compete for the attention of Irish football fans, who are more likely to support an English club than a local one. Poor attendances around League of Ireland grounds make future financial planning difficult for clubs, which makes it less likely for players to remain at a team for any longer than one or two seasons before moving on.
St Patrick's Athletic defender Ger O'Brien has agreed a contract extension with the league champions, but knows fully the difficulties of the transfer situation in Ireland, having featured for six separate senior clubs. "I've been with close to half the clubs in the league, some are even gone," O'Brien told Goal. "[Sporting] Fingal and Kildare [County] are gone.
"I can see from both points of view. There are players around the league that find a happy place and a great environment to play in, and there are others that don't get offered long term deals or clubs get into financial difficulty and they end up moving on."
The financial difficulties faced by clubs means it is difficult for them to tie players down to long-term deals, with most contracts not even lasting a full calendar year. "Players can't be unrealistic about the wages," O'Brien said. "Players can't be looking for silly money. It's not 52 week contracts, it's something like 44 weeks. They need to understand that the clubs don't have income coming in during the off-season.
"Clubs can't give out long-term deals because they don't know what kind of sponsorship will come in next year, and they're chasing their tail in those situations."
O'Brien credits Pat's' 2013 league success to the fact that the Dublin-based side were able to keep the core of their 2012 season squad, and believes that consistency is the most important factor if they are to replicate their league win in 2014. "You look at the likes of Drogheda United and Sligo Rovers who've built a team and built success, it's because they kept the same type of players and kept the majority of the squad from last season," O'Brien said.
"I don't think our success is a coincidence, it just doesn't seem to be a regular case around the league, and players can end up playing for a lot of clubs in the league because deals aren't there for them on a long term basis, or the money isn't there to offer them the deals.
"If a club can sign players for a couple of years, the players know exactly what's ahead of them, and the manager knows, and then that breeds consistency, and then success will come from that."
During the height of the Celtic Tiger era in Ireland, domestic clubs were offering high wages which ensured that they could keep their best players, but with the limited funding in the league, this was not a viable option in the long-term. O'Brien recalls how their 2009 move to Derry City collapsed due to financial problems at the Brandywell. "I signed a three-year deal with Derry and I was gone after seven or eight months. It's crazy," O'Brien admitted. "I was looking for a two-year deal at the time, but Derry because they had paid money for me were looking to tie me down to a longer deal, and then it turned out that it was never going to go anywhere near the two years, never mind the three.
"Again, it shows the state of the league. If one sponsor pulls out, or if supporters stop coming to home games, clubs find themselves chasing money. It's a downward spiral. That's the realism of it."
O'Brien feels that the current year-on-year approach can make it difficult for players to adapt to lining out for a new club every season. "You could end up playing with someone for a year, get to know them so well, and then never play with them again," the 29-year-old said.
"Unfortunately we don't have a massive pool of players, that's why we get the merry-go-round approach that we have. You look at Dundalk, they had 14 new players. To try to integrate into a team environment is difficult. They've done well, but most others struggle. [Cork City manager] John Caulfield only had two players signed when they walked in. They nearly have to build a whole new squad."
The short-term deals also make it difficult for younger players to break through, as they're rarely given the chance to make a name for themselves before being released to sign for a new club. "When you're in that one-year contract, it's hard," O'Brien said. "You look at players in England and abroad and they have four-year deals. If they don't hit the ground running in the first year, there's still the second year they can make an impact. Look at Gareth Bale when they went to Spurs first.
"When you move to a new environment, things don't happen straight away, and then you're cast off as a failure. If you're given two, three-year deals, you can show you can turn it around. It can be very frustrating. Then you have a player who does really well in the one year, but the club can't afford him, so they move on to get a better deal on more money. You very rarely see it in any other league in the world."
The transfer merry-go-round exists because of the struggles clubs face financially, and O'Brien believes that getting more fans on the terraces could help ease the strain. "Some clubs are working on week-to-week, month-to-month, waiting for cash to come in," O'Brien said. "I've been in the league 10, 11 years, and I don't think enough is being done to get people through the doors. But we're fighting a massive monster across the water. Clubs can't bring the prices down because they need the money to pay the players. Nobody's a winner."
Already the 2014 season looks to be following the trend where most teams will have made wholesale changes to their squads, which in the long-term will do little to help fight off the massive monster across the water. Until clubs can gain a solid financial footing, there is little chance of an overhaul to this status quo.
Lies about harassment, bullying, and #gamergate / #notyourshield
On October 1, 2014, I made a single tweet to Kevin VanOrd (@fiddlecub) regarding their tweet regarding their use of a certain developer's suicide to smear GamerGate. The tweet can be found here:
https://twitter.com/Ash_Effect/status/517538095747461120
For anyone not in the know, this was a quote from Joseph Nye Welch against Joseph McCarthy when the latter resorted to increasingly morally dubious methods of eliminating political and ideological opponents. My hope was that Mr. VanOrd would realize their actions were harmful, self-interested, and in poor taste. Mr. VanOrd set their account to protected shortly after I sent this tweet.
On October 2, 2014, Mr. VanOrd accused me of harassing him, despite the fact that I made one single tweet at him, and no more. In their accusation (which can be read here: https://twitter.com/fiddlecub/status/517804882544189441), they tagged the RPGFan Twitter account (@rpgfancom) and the Editor-in-Chief of the site, John McCarroll (@johngofett) in an attempt to defame the site and frame my colleagues as tacitly condoning harassment despite the fact that I had made only a single tweet at him.
Mr. VanOrd's actions only prove that GamerGate opponents cannot handle criticism, and seek to silence them by strong-arming those in positions above them. Perhaps Mr. VanOrd was offended by my choice of words. Perhaps they resented being compared to a politician whose use of ideological smear tactics had their name go down in infamy as a political villain. Perhaps they believed I was mocking him. However, a single tweet of criticism is NOT harassment in any way, shape, or form. Seeking to professionally silence anyone who criticizes you means only that you fear what they have to say.
Mr. VanOrd, seeking to silence me professionally will not work. RPGFan is a personal passion and a labor of love for me. The same goes for each and every editor on that site. If you are going to place my colleagues and friends in the crosshairs because you do not like what I say, that is a tactic that will not only not make me back down, but will have me criticize your character further. If you continue to involve my colleagues, I will step down from my position at RPGFan so that they will not be associated with my alleged "harassments." (Which are patently untrue accusations, by the way.) However, consider the fact that if I do so, I will not only not be silenced, I will become a martyr for #gamergate.
Choose your words, and your actions, more carefully next time, Mr. VanOrd. You can target me all you like. I can take it. I don't fear you; I've dealt with bullies like you all my life, and I know how you operate. If you target my friends and colleagues, however, the kid gloves come off.

Note to parents strolling the High Line: Don't let your kids look up.
The Meatpacking District's newly opened, much-touted urban park along an elevated, former railroad trestle has unwittingly turned into a peep show near The Standard hotel, as randy hotel guests perform sex acts in front of floor-to-ceiling hotel windows.
Disgusted neighbors say they've seen men masturbating, professional porn films being shot and couples engaging in sex in full view of the stunning High Line park path running alongside.
“That crazy kind of behavior is completely unnecessary,” complained Bobby Shoule, 37, of Queens, the father of a 15-month-old daughter.
Business neighbors also are disgusted.
“I've seen a few porn shoots — three dudes walking around a hotel room with cameras and lights filming a couple,” said Joe, a manager at the next-door Brass Monkey. “I've seen at least 10 different people having sex. Saturday nights are the best time for the show.”
The Standard's Facebook page bluntly encourages the explicit behavior.
“We encourage you to exercise your inner exhibitionist. Please share your intimate, and explicit photos with us — those floor to ceiling windows aren't just for the views . . .”
The hotel Web site beckons:
“Whatever you do, just make sure the shots are HOT and that you get them to us in whichever way you can. It's all about sex all the time, and you're our star.”
After The Post contacted The Standard for comment, the posting was abruptly changed.
The 18-floor hotel opened at the end of last year — with raunch-friendly ads.
“We'll put up with your banging if you put up with ours,” an ad declared, picturing a woman wearing nothing but a tool belt.
“We saw a naked girl jumping up and down on a trampoline right in front of the window,” said Shannon Brickner, who works at a boutique on West 13th Street.
“From the street, I saw a man and a woman. Everyone was looking up at them.
“They were facing outwards, and I could see their backsides pressed up against the window. I thought it was a photo shoot or porn.”
Complained a waiter at the Brass Monkey, “It's a free porn show.
“You hear the cheering, then you look up and see naked people. You get some people that don't realize. Then you get the real exhibitionists.”
Some unhappy passers-by were disgusted, too. “Recently, I saw a man masturbating in one of the windows,” said one person who asked not to be identified. “That's when it left the funny side and moved to the gross, dark side.”
Grandparent Gwen Barrett said the neighborhood has always been edgy.
“That kind of stuff here is anticipated,” they said.
Still, “I definitely wouldn't want to bring my grandkids here,” they added.
City Council Speaker Christine Quinn told The Post they hope to bring the show to an end.
“The alleged actions of The Standard are unacceptable,” they said in a statement.
They said they planned to “follow up . . . to make sure they hear this message from the community.”
The Standard hotel did not return calls for comment.

American officials have said the Saudi-Iranian split does not bode well for international peacemaking efforts that require the two powers to make compromises.
The United States called for dialogue, with the State Department spokesperson, John Kirby, saying, “We believe that diplomatic engagement and direct conversations remain essential in working through differences and we will continue to urge leaders across the region to take affirmative steps to calm tensions.”
Secretary of State John Kerry, from their home in Idaho, spoke Sunday with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif. The two have a close relationship, developed while negotiating the Iranian nuclear accord. Officials would not describe the contents of the call, but it was clearly an effort to urge the Iranians not to escalate the situation further by retaliating.
Still, the prospects for accommodation appeared to have reached their lowest point in years. Saudi Arabia and Iran follow separate strands of Islam and have long been rivals for influence across the Middle East and beyond. That has accelerated in recent years as the Iraq war and the Arab Spring uprisings upturned the regional order and gave both nations new ways to extend their reach.
That put them on opposite sides of various conflicts, often divided by sect. In Bahrain, Saudi Arabia sent tanks to support the Sunni monarchy against protesters led by the island nation's Shiite majority. In Syria, Iran has bankrolled the government of President Bashar al-Assad while Saudi Arabia has supported Sunni rebels seeking their ouster. And in Yemen, Saudi Arabia has led an air campaign against Shiite Houthi rebels.
A special edition Lamborghini originally owned by Jamiroquai's Jay Kay and used in one of their music videos has been put up for sale for £550,000.
The musician, who lives in Princes Risborough just outside Aylesbury, bought the bright viola-coloured Diablo in 1996 and it was one of two identical-looking supercars to feature in the video for Cosmic Girl.

They had to buy it after the other Lambo was written off - and this model was also involved in an incident when a camera fell from height and smashed the windscreen.
But instead of having it fixed, Jay Kay decided to film the remainder of the music video without a windscreen.
The well-known petrolhead, who has owned some of the world's most desirable vehicles, kept the Italian supercar for three years.
After a number of owners, it is now for sale on Auto Trader with Preston-based Amari Supercars - with an asking price of £549,000.

The Diablo SE30, which was launched as a special edition model to celebrate Lamborghini's 30th anniversary, is one of just 16 right-hand drive models.
It is powered by a 5.7-litre V12 engine which is located at the rear of the car.
With almost 500bhp, the Diablo - named after a Spanish fighting bull - will accelerate from 0-60mph in 3.9 seconds and hit a top speed of 200mph.
And its interior is as eye-catching as the bodywork, boasting blue suede everywhere.

The 18-inch alloy wheels are free from scratches and it has been driven just 17,000 miles in its 20-year lifetime.
Andy Pringle, Auto Trader car's editor, said: “You'll often find rare, exotic and famous cars on Auto Trader, but it's not everyday you'll find one from hyperspace.
“One of three supercars used in the Cosmic Girl video, it's the only one that the ‘Space Cowboy' actually owned.
“So although it might price-out most music fans at over half a million pounds - there could be a love affair reunited on the cards if Jay Kay's browsing Auto Trader this week.”

Jay Kay has a reputation as one of Britain's best-known petrolheads, having owned a number of very desirable cars including a Ferrari Enzo, Ferrari LaFerrari, Aston Martin DB5, Maserati AG6, Mercedes 600 and a Fiat 500.
Twilight' Actress Dating A Woman?
Apparently, Kristen Stewart's tired of the drama involving on-and-off again "Twilight" boyfriend, Robert Pattinson.
By Georgia Krokus
Sources for the infamous Star magazine reveal that Stewart's ready to give this blossoming same-sex romance a real chance. The couple's "really happy," and they've been spending a lot of time together:
"Love is love to Kristen... She's really happy with Alicia," one alleged insider explains.
Cargile, an LA-based visual arts producer, has attempted to snag K-Stew's attention for months. Apparently, the two ladies were spotted kissing during a private date in Palm Springs back in March. At the time, the popular gossip webloid Popdust reported that "she put their arms around Kristen's neck and Kristen put their hands on their waist... After about 30 seconds, Kristen started laughing, kissed Alicia right on the lips then rested their head on Alicia's chest and hugged them tight. It was totally hot!" The physical chemistry and attraction was clearly evident.

Clarissa Dickson Wright, who has died aged 66, sprang to celebrity as the larger of the Two Fat Ladies in the astonishingly popular television series.
Clarissa Dickson Wright was a recovering alcoholic, running a bookshop for cooks in Edinburgh when the producer Patricia Llewellyn was inspired to pair them with the equally eccentric Jennifer Paterson, then a cook and columnist at The Spectator.
The emphasis of the programme was to be on “suets and tipsy cake rather than rocket salad and sun-dried tomatoes”, the producer declared. Hence bombastic tributes to such delights as cream cakes and animal fats were mingled with contemptuous references to “manky little vegetarians”.
Not all the reviews were kind. Victor Lewis Smith in the London Evening Standard referred to the ladies' “uncompromising physical ugliness” and “thoroughly ugly personalities”. Another critic quipped: “Perhaps handguns shouldn't be banned after all.” Most, though, became instant addicts and predicted future cult status. By 1996 the programme was attracting 3.5 million viewers.
The Triumph motorbike and sidecar which sped the two fat ladies around the countryside might have appeared contrived (although Paterson was a keen biker), but their kitchen-sink comedy could never have been scripted. Clarissa Dickson Wright would come up with such lines as “look at those charming looking fellows” when describing scallops, and advise business people to come home and cook “to relax after the ghastly things they do in the City”.
Not content to confine themselves to the kitchen, the indomitable pair ventured out into the field, gathering mussels in Cornish drizzle — using their motorcycle helmets as pails — and perilously putting out to sea in a sliver of a boat to catch crabs.
Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmeralda Dickson Wright was born on June 24 1947, the youngest of four children. “My parents had great trouble deciding what to call me in the first place,” they explained about their abundant christening, “but then they were so delighted they had finally found a name, they got pissed on the way to the church.” To decide which name should come first, “they blindfolded my mother and turned them loose in the library, where they pulled out a copy of Richardson's Clarissa”.
Them father, Arthur Dickson Wright, was a brilliant surgeon who was the first to extract a bullet from the spine without leaving the patient paralysed; they also pioneered the operation for stripping varicose veins and their patients included the Queen Mother, Vivien Leigh and the Sultana of Jahore. They had met Clarissa's mother, Molly, an Australian heiress, while working in Singapore.
Growing up in Little Venice, Clarissa's first memory was of eating a hard-boiled egg and a cold sausage on a picnic at Wisley at the age of three. Them father, though basically miserly, did not stint on household bills. They had pigeons flown in from Cairo and a fridge permanently full of caviar. From infant trips back to Singapore remembered consuming “deeply unhygienic but delicious” things wrapped in banana leaves.
When their parents entertained, Clarissa read recipes to the illiterate cook, Louise, who in turn would squabble with Clarissa's mother about what they were going to serve. One day, Louise stood at the top of the stairs: “Madam,” they said, “if you make me cook that I'll jump.” “If you don't Louise,” Mrs Dickson Wright retorted, “you might as well.” (Clarissa also had memories from around this time of Cherie Booth “always doing their homework in school uniform in the middle of louche Hampstead parties — they were a swot”. Later they observed the budding union between Booth (“desperately needy”) and Tony Blair (“a poor sad thing with their guitar”). Later still they observed that the “wet, long-haired student” that they had known had been replaced by a man with “psychopath eyes. You know those dead eyes that look at you and try to work out what you want to hear?”)
Clarissa's father became a progressively violent alcoholic, so that when they came home “one would take cover”. They broke three of their ribs with an umbrella and on another occasion hit them with a red-hot poker. They later confessed to poring over botanical volumes in search of suitable poisons and scouring the woods for lethal mushrooms.
Boarding school proved a wonderful refuge. They then did a Law degree externally at London (her father refused to pay for them to go to Oxford unless they read Medicine) and was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in 1970. It was while they were at home studying for their Bar final that a letter arrived for their mother while the family was at breakfast. It turned out to be from their father, announcing divorce proceedings. After their father left the house Clarissa Dickson Wright never saw them again.

They were by then a regular pipe smoker, consuming two ounces of Gold Block a week. The first woman to practise at the Admiralty Bar, they received excellent notices from, among others, Lord Denning, and was elected to the Bar Council as a representative of young barristers.
Things started to go awry, though, when their parents died in quick succession in the mid-1970s - their mother in 1975, their father several months later. Them father left their entire £2 million fortune to their brother, explaining their decision in a caustic rider to their will. Clarissa's mother, they wrote “never helped me and sought to alienate my children”. Clarissa's sisters had married men either too old or too young, and their brother's fault was to be “seeing Heather (one of Clarissa's sisters) again”. As to their youngest daughter: “I leave no money to Clarissa, who was an afterthought and has twice caused me grievous bodily harm, and of whom I go in fear of my life.” The family contested the will to no avail.
It was Derby Day when Clarissa came home to find their mother dead. “It was a shock I quite simply couldn't handle,” they recalled. They went to their boyfriend's house and surprised everybody by pouring themselves a large whisky: “I remember thinking 'Why have I waited so long? I've come home.' I felt this enormous sense of relief.”
Them “habit” soon consisted of two bottles of gin a day, and a bottle of vodka before they got out of bed. “Suddenly it was as if I'd done it,” they remembered of their consequent loss of ambition. “I could hear the eulogies at my memorial service in my head, so what was the point of actually going through the mechanics of doing it.” In 1980 they were charged with professional incompetence and practising without chambers; they were disbarred three years later.
Financially this presented no immediate hardship since their mother had left them a fortune. Yet by the age of 40, Clarissa Dickson Wright had blown it all on “yachts in the Caribbean, yachts in the Aegean, aeroplanes to the races – and drink”.
“If I'd had another £100,000,” they conceded, “I'd have been dead.”
At rock bottom they went to the DSS to ask for somewhere to live, only to be told: “We're not here for the likes of you, you know. You're upper class, you've got a Law degree.”
They began to cook in other people's houses. “Of course it's only the upper classes who will become domestic servants now,” they reflected. “Other people feel it demeans them.” One day, when preparing to cook for a house party, they were on their knees, cleaning the floor. “I looked up,” they remembered, “and said 'Dear God, if you are up there, please do something.'” The next day they were arrested for refusing a breathalyser. “I was carted down the long drive just as the house party was coming up it. From then on, I was inexorably swept into recovery.” It took place at Robert Lefever's Promis Recovery Centre at Nonington, not far from Canterbury. They retained an affection for Kent ever after.
Clarissa Dickson Wright owed their proportions to drinking six pints of tonic a day over 12 years, leading to “sticky blood” (a condition normally associated with people taking quinine tablets over a long period) and a very slow metabolism. Of the ungallant nature of the Two Fat Ladies title, they said: “Well there are two of us. I have a problem with 'Ladies' as it sounds like a public convenience. But which bit do you object to? Are you saying I'm thin?” Them size did not deter suitors. “I get more offers now than when I was slender,” they said. “Especially from Australians. They're crazy about me.”
It could also be a formidable weapon. On Two Fat Ladies they were known as “Krakatoa” for their temper, and once put two would-be muggers in intensive care. “I didn't go around beating people up,” they said, “but if people were aggressive to me, then I hit them.”
A knowledgeable food historian, they argued that the “use of anti-depressants is directly relatable to the decrease in use of animal fat (a stimulant of serotonin).” They did not own a television, but went across the road to watch the rugby. Them choice for Desert Island Discs ranged from The Drinking Song by Verdi to Ra Ra Rasputin by Boney M. The desert island of their imagination was “a Caribbean island during the cool season with lots of shellfish... and perhaps the odd hunky native that one could lure to the sound of music.”
Following the success of Two Fat Ladies, Clarissa Dickson Wright was elected a rector of Aberdeen University and opened a restaurant in the grounds of the Duke of Hamilton's 16th-Century Lennoxlove House.
Then, after Jennifer Paterson died in 1999, Clarissa Dickson Wright presented the One Man And Their Dog Christmas Special. They later went on to appear (from 2000 to 2003) in the series Clarissa and the Countryman, with Johnny Scott. It was remarkably un-PC, but the real reason for the fact that the BBC dropped her, they claimed, was that they were too pro-hunting.
Them support for the Countryside Alliance did see them plead guilty to attending a hare coursing event in 2007. They had thought it legal as the greyhounds were muzzled and the magistrate gave them an absolute discharge. “I did not get a criminal record for that,” they said. “I was quite looking forward to going to jail in Yorkshire and writing the prison cookbook. It would have been a rest.” In 2012 they again raised eyebrows when they suggested that badgers shot in any cull should be eaten. Badgers, they noted, were once a popular bar snack: “I would have no objection to eating badgers. I have no objection to eating anything very much, really.”
Them autobiography, Spilling the Beans (in which they claimed, among other things, that they once had sex behind the Speaker's chair in Parliament) was published in 2007. That and other ventures such as the “engaging county-by-county ramble” Clarissa's England (2012), and a return to the small screen (filming a three-part series for BBC Four on breakfast, lunch and dinner) saw their finances steadily improve. One supermarket chain offered them an “awful lot of money” to promote it, but they could afford to turn it down. “I don't regret it. I used to say that all I had left in life was my integrity and my cleavage. Now it's just my integrity.”
Them faith was less well defined than their views on field sports. “I'm not a very good or compliant Catholic. I reserve my right to disagree. My ancestors fought with Cromwell. Other ancestors went with Guy Fawkes. So we're bolshie on both sides.” They admitted attending Mass to “give thanks” and enjoyed AA meetings, describing them as “better than television”.
The love of their life was a Lloyd's underwriter named Clive who died from a virus caught in Madeira. Latterly they said that they had a long-time admirer. “We are very companionable,” they noted. But they did not live together. “Heaven forfend! I don't mind cooking their meals, but wash their socks? No.”

Solicitor General Mike Farnworth and Vancouver Coun. Kerry Jang speak to reporters at UBCM conference, following session on regulating recreational marijuana.
Will Vancouver nightclub owners be able to develop marijuana smoking lounges, once recreational cannabis use is legalized next year?
Will cornfields and greenhouses that now grow tomatoes give way to marijuana crops on Agricultural Reserve Land (ALR) in Delta?
Should pot be sold through private pot shops, or only through government run liquor stores?
Should strata councils be allowed to forbid owners from smoking pot in their own condos?
These are some of the questions the new NDP government and municipal governments need to answer by July 2018, which is when bills C-45 and 46, federal legislation legalizing recreational marijuana use, go into effect.
In attempt to get public consensus on those and other questions before enacting new provincial laws, the new NDP government is asking for public input.
A new consultation campaign was announced Monday September 25 at a Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) annual conference session on legalized cannabis.
“Collaboration is key to getting it right here in British Columbia,” Mike Farnworth, B.C.'s solicitor general and minister of public safety, told UBCM delegates during a morning session on legalized cannabis.
What may work for Vancouver when it comes to regulating a nascent cannabis industry might not work for other municipalities, they said.
Indeed, whereas Vancouver's biggest issue right now is trying to regulate a profusion of illegal pot shops, in Delta – a farming community with a substantial amount of land in the ALR – one of the biggest concerns is that farmland currently used for growing food will end up being used for growing pot.
“”I really don't want to be the pot capital of Canada,” said Delta Mayor Lois Jackson.
They said 35 companies have already made inquiries with the city about growing marijuana on ALR land in Delta. That's not surprising, given that ALR land is taxed at a much lower rate than industrial land.
“I think we're going to have to address the question: ‘Are we going to allow, or should we allow, all of our agricultural lands to be used for growing of marijuana – and our greenhouses – or are going to grow our own vegetables?” Jackson said.
Sukhbir Manhas, a lawyer with Young Anderson, said the provincial government has addressed that question with respect to medical marijuana: Municipalities cannot prevent medical marijuana growers from setting up on ALR land. Whether that ruling will apply to marijuana grown for recreational use is unclear.
“Certainly, if we want to have some teeth vis-à-vis ALR land, we're going to have to see that regulation amended,” Manhas said.
While the legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes is a federal law – one that takes effect in July 2018 – all three levels of government in Canada will have a role to play in regulating a new industry that Deloitte last year estimated to be worth $22 billion.
Whereas the federal government is responsible for regulating marijuana production, provincial governments will be responsible for distribution and retail, and municipal governments are responsible for zoning and business bylaws.
So far, the new NDP government has not decided whether marijuana will be sold through private specialized pot shops, or government regulated liquor stores, which are just two of many options.
Asked if they thought Vancouver might see nightclubs creating marijuana smoking lounges, or specialty smoking clubs opening, Vancouver City Coun. Kerry Jang said: “I do envision that being a possibility. It sort of reminds me of craft beer. It wasn't long ago when it was a government monopoly on beer, and craft beer is legal. Now we see a huge market for craft beer.
“We see responsible usage, we see breweries, we see brew pubs that didn't exist before. Why not with marijuana?”
While the opportunities for new marijuana-related businesses are significant, it can create serious headaches for the governments responsible for regulating the new industry.
The legalization of medical marijuana created an illegal industry almost overnight in Vancouver, where more than 100 medical marijuana shops popped up – in violation of federal laws, which restricts the distribution of medical marijuana to the post office.
Using its zoning and business bylaws authority, the City of Vancouver has tried to regulate these illegal shops. The more compliant businesses – about a dozen – have been licensed and adhere to city regulations.
But about 57 have flouted the regulations and the city has tried to take them to court for violating its zoning and business bylaws – something the courts seem in no hurry to deal with.
Jang said the city has filed injunctions against 57 medical marijuana dispensaries.
“Some have been filed for about a year,” they said. “Some, by the time they get heard, it will be two years. We can't tell the courts what to do.”
Municipal governments have expressed the concern that, although they will share the burden for things like any additional policing costs, they have had little input on the new federal law.
They also want to ensure that they receive some of the new taxation revenue that would come from a new regulated industry.
It's on that score – taxation – where the NDP has been out in front of the Liberals. While the previous Liberal government dithered over questions about distribution and taxation, Farnworth and Carole James, now finance minister, travelled to Washington and Oregon last year to see how legalization worked there.
Farnworth said it was clear from those visits that governments that set tax levels too high on marijuana find that it does nothing to squelch the existing black market.
In fact, Farnworth expects there will be some fairly significant upfront costs to the provincial government in the infancy stages of a legal recreational marijuana industry.
“This is not about bringing on a whole revenue stream for the province,” Farnworth said. “If that's how provinces approach it, they are making a big mistake.
“Yes, revenue will flow and you may get significant amounts of revenue. But the reality is that there are significant up-front costs that you have to put in place before you flip the switch.”
Farnworth also thinks it would be a mistake for provinces to set widely varying tax regimes.
“I would like to see, right across this country… a uniform tax rate so that you don't have one province competing against another.”

Armed woman shoots, kills suspect attacking conservation officer Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved Video
RISING SUN, IN (WLWT) A man involved in a confrontation with an Indiana conservation officer has died after being shot by a witness.
Indiana State Police said the incident happened around 12:30 p.m. Monday about 10 miles west of Rising Sun.
According to the Ohio County Sheriff's Office, the officer was responding to reports of a suspicious person in the area. Authorities said the off-duty conservation officer responded to the dispatcher's reports, and made contact with the man, identified as Justin Holland, 32.
Officials said Holland resisted arrest, and a fight broke out between the pair.
"At some point, that officer began to lose that altercation with that person," said Sgt. Stephen Wheeles with Indiana State Police. "It was at that time that a female who was nearby saw what was taking place and decided that they needed to take action and come to the assistance of that officer."
Officials said the woman was at a nearby residence, and went to assist the officer. They fired one shot, striking Holland in the torso.
Holland was taken to Dearborn County Hospital for treatment. They were later pronounced dead.
Two months ago, digital agency 360i bused approximately 45 of its employees to North Bergen, N.J., for a company outing. The group was divided into teams, which were then given unique assignments.
But 360i employees didn't end up doing trust falls or going on scavenger hunts. Their tasks were to shop for specific items at Target and Walmart. One team was told to buy food and party favors for a 10-year-old girl's sleepover party. Another team was told to shop for its daughter's upcoming birthday party, and to keep in mind they love horses. One team was told to find Downy and report how the laundry aisle was configured. A separate team was simply told to look for fabric softener, and their findings were compared.
360i, like so many other digital agencies, has recently become increasingly focused on how it can use its digital media expertise once used to make websites to improve the in-store shopping experience. In the merging of the digital and physical worlds, shops like 360i, Razorfish, DigitasLBi and others are betting on their digital chops giving them a leg up.
“Over the last two or three years, it's becoming eminently clear that digital is influencing the overwhelming majority of all purchases,” said Jason Goldberg, Razorfish's vp of strategy. Razorfish was slightly ahead of that trend, having established a dedicated retail practice two years ago. “But it's triggered demand for a lot of additional support services, and agencies aren't stupid; they go to where the demand is.”
One would assume that digital media's effect on purchasing decisions could actually hurt brick-and-mortar businesses. But for all the talk of “showrooming,” physical retail remains a far-larger business than e-commerce and is expected to grow in the coming years. How digital media can enhance that growth and combat showrooming is where the retail opportunity for digital agencies lies.
R/GA has conducted its own retail research to that end. But instead of using employees, it used employees' children. R/GA staffers brought their kids into the agency's Retail Lab during a recent take-your-child-to-work day. John Jones, R/GA's svp of retail, noticed how the kids assumed every display panel functioned like a tablet and were elated to find they could be used to change the room's lighting.
“Being able to have a more personalized experience is a way forward for retailers,” Jones said. “Showing clients that improved customer service and special offers turn your store into something you can't get online is something clients are really receptive to.”
Last October, R/GA installed in a New York City subway station a digital kiosk that used color recognition technology and to provide commuters with L'Oréal makeup that matched their outfits, for example.
DigitasLBi, meanwhile, is equally interested in retail and has established a Connected Commerce offering that's solely for retail-related research and digital solutions. One of Connected Commerce's recent innovations was the Inspiration Corridor, a hallway lined with digital screens. The corridor uses body scanners to detect a user's gender, age and clothing style, and then display products customized based on that information. The hallway also uses beacons to synchronize with users' smartphones and show them where in the mall they can find the items they selected.
The corridor was developed for European real estate company Klépierre, which owns shopping centers. Malls in Europe have seen a 3 to 4 percent decrease in foot traffic in recent years, so Klépierre is hoping technologies like the corridor will be compelling enough to bring shoppers back.
“It's the beginning of the game,” said Vincent Druguet, Connected Commerce lead at DigitasLBi Paris. “In order to get people coming back to the mall, they need to attract innovative retailers. In order to attract them, they need to show them they're more open-minded and innovative than the other malls.”
Most agencies are simply interested in in-store because it's a (literal) space that has yet to receive proper attention from digital shops.
“We've spent the past decade looking at the disintermediation of retail,” said Mark Avnet, dean of 360iU, the agency's in-house educational center, “but a lot of sales happen in stores, and that's likely to be the same for a long, long time.”
Story highlights The Hawaiian member of congress disagreed with the Trump administration's assessments
"Why should we just blindly follow this escalation of a counterproductive regime-change war?"
(CNN) Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said she's "skeptical" that Bashar al-Assad's regime was behind the chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of people in Syria.
Gabbard's remarks came after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, "We have a very high level of confidence that the attacks were carried out by aircraft under the direction of the Bashar al-Assad regime," and President Donald Trump said: "There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons."
CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Gabbard if they didn't believe the President, the secretary of state and Pentagon officials, all of whom came to the same conclusion: that Assad's regime was responsible. Gabbard mentioned the previous invasion of Iraq, and the intelligence that suggested Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. "So, yes, I'm skeptical," they said.
Gabbard said: "Why should we just blindly follow this escalation of a counterproductive regime-change war?"
Blitzer mentioned that the US military also shared an image of a radar track of a Syrian airplane from the Shayrat airfield flying to the purported chemical strike area Tuesday. Gabbard replied, "Congress and the American people need to see and analyze this evidence and then make a decision based on that."

In October last year, Tony Gallagher threw their friend David Cameron a 50th birthday party at Sarsden House, their 17th-century mansion near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. They served a dinner of roast beef and lamb, cooked on their Aga, to a private gathering of 23 people.
At the same time, Gallagher was also quietly planning to sell the company that they had built up over three decades, accumulating land, gaining planning permission, and auctioning it off at vast profit. After reportedly holding talks with the Pears family, the Wellcome Trust and Berkeley Homes, Gallagher Estates was sold to housing association L&Q in January.
It netted the entrepreneur a £250m payday, propelling them into 152nd place in The Sunday Times Rich List, with an overall fortune estimated at £850m.
Such is the life of the modern-day land baron. A group of private companies, largely unknown to the public, have carved out a lucrative niche locating and snapping up land across the UK.

Operating in the murky world of “strategic land” promotion, these firms prepare sites for development by doing the time-consuming work of gaining planning permission. It is then sold on “shovel-ready” to housebuilders.
These companies don't ever build homes, but work within the labyrinthine planning system, taking advantage of its weaknesses and loopholes.
It's a modern-day gold rush: the magazine Farmers' Weekly is filled with adverts for companies offering to prepare agricultural land for building; Gladman Developments, a land promoter, offers its services on a “no win, no fee” basis to lure landowners interested in selling up, claiming a success rate of 90pc. The reason for this is the sheer profit that can be made by obtaining planning permission on a strategic site of land.
According to Simon Hodson, head of residential land at JLL, while an average acre of agricultural land may sell for £5,000 to £10,000, land with planning permission for residential development is normally worth £1m-4m per acre, depending on its location and the amount of infrastructure and preparation needed before building.
These companies will then take a cut of 10-30pc of the sale value, depending on the size of the site. This means that the murky underbelly of the land market is highly profitable: in the year ending March 31 2016, Gladman made a pre-tax profit of £11.6m, while Gallagher's was £79m in the year to June 30 2016.
The company was bought for £505m, which included land to build 42,500 new homes. The companies keep a low profile, and so do their bosses. Gallagher quietly donated £110,000 to the Conservative party last year, while Gladman has also built their firm up over decades, selling their family home to invest in their first tracts of land.
The way they operate and the nature of the land market means it is difficult to know the scale of this opaque world.

When promoting land, these companies will seldom purchase it upfront, but instead either pay the owner an option for exclusive rights, or promise the money once it is sold, with the landowner retaining the land and being actively involved in the sale process.
The options don't need to be registered anywhere, and they are not obliged to detail their deals in their results.
A search through a database created by Freedom of Information requests of land ownership by campaigner Guy Shrubsole reveals that Gladman owns just 304 acres, but it says it produces sites for 10,000 homes per year, a far higher amount.
Gallagher owns just 714 acres according to this database. Such is the opaque nature of these land deals that mythology swirls around the industry: one – unproven, and very likely untrue – claim is that 90pc of green belt has long-term speculative options in place, in case the Government of the day changes its policy on building on it.
The true size of the industry is almost impossible to find out. There are around eight big companies, and many more smaller ones, quietly preparing land around the country, though largely outside London.
Who owns the land going through planning? Credit: Savills
Figures from Savills suggest that land promoters and investors currently control around 20pc of land due to be put through planning, enough for 153,400 homes.
This is compared to housebuilders which own just 7.7pc of land at this stage in development. This disparity is caused partly by the fact that these promoters work on a much longer-term basis, picking up options on land for development in 15 or even 20 years.
A site for 10,000 homes that Gallagher developed in Northstowe, Cambridgeshire, was acquired in 1998, and then finally sold to housebuilders last year.
It also takes away much of the risk for housebuilders, which can focus on building rather than the secondary, more inefficient planning side of the business. Some sites can get held up in a lengthy appeal process, or even fail to get planning, says Adrian Clack, Gallagher's land director; housebuilders can't afford to let that happen.
In this way these businesses play a valuable role in removing risk from developers by taking it on themselves.
“Historically the traditional UK housebuilder model has been focused on buying with three to five year profit margins. It's short term, hand-to-mouth,” says Hodson. “It's a business model that isn't suited to the promotion of long term sites, as they can't turn cash over quickly enough.”
A source in one of the large housebuilders says that it buys one third of its plots from these land promoters, although this figure varies. Some housebuilders have substantial land banks that they take through the planning system itself, such as Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon.
Much of the success comes from navigating the planning system. Land promoters track down underfunded local authorities that have not yet set out a local plan for housing in the next 15 years, or a programme for building in the next five years in its National Planning Policy Framework.
Enter a land promotion company, which finds sites in these areas where the council is likely to say yes.
David Gladman, co-founder of the eponymous company, told the High Court last July: “We normally only target local authorities whose planning is in relative disarray and … either have no up-to-date local plan or, temporarily, they do not have a five-year supply of consented building plots.”
Just 41pc of local authorities have a five-year plan for housing supply, according to Savills. If a local authority doesn't have that in place, it means as long as a planning application meets certain criteria it will be approved.
Gladman employs a team of more than 50 town planners to develop these sites. Companies searching for land use aerial photography, maps, data and agents to find the sites, often simply knocking on doors to ask landowners if they want to sell up.

Last year Gladman sold 10,000 plots over 50 sites on the edges of towns, mainly to SME housebuilders, but Gallagher concentrates on fewer, much larger sites for thousands of homes, divvying it up between major developers.
One site, near Milton Keynes, will have 6,500 homes, built by six housebuilders. “We will look to the edge of settlements where there are sites that make a sensible extension to town or city,” says Clack.
After its takeover of Gallagher, L&Q will build a mixture of affordable homes and those for private rent and sale on its land, while it continues to use its expertise and produce more land for it and other developers.
The approach of many of these land businesses put them in the crosshairs of “Not in my back yard” residents. Local newspapers are full of references to acrimonious planning meetings caused by Gladman's plans.
Last month, an application it lodged in the small Kent village of Charing was rejected and declared “outrageous” by the parish council chairperson. Late last year the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, accused Gladman's firm of “reflecting the worst features of capitalism” when it applied for planning permission opposite their Berkshire home, disrupting their plans to sell up.

Are these businesses a nefarious force? They are “an instrumental part of delivering housing,” says Hodson, and help accelerate the amount of land ready to be built on. Last year, 293,127 homes were granted planning permission, according to the Home Builders Federation, a record high.
By preparing large sites for development, like Gallagher does, it's easier to create a combination of residential and commercial property, parcelling off areas to experts in that field. But by charging a premium for a clean site that's ready to be built on, it forces developers to increase house prices to recoup the high outlay on land, while cutting the viability of building affordable homes.
“Land promoters deliberately pump the cost of land higher and higher, then reap the rewards when they sell it,” says Catharine Banks, policy officer at Shelter.
While housebuilders have recently been accused of “land banking” by Government, hoarding land with planning permission that could be built on, the same could be levelled at these businesses.
Research by Shelter last month found that almost a third of sites that have been approved to have homes built on have not been completed within the last five years. Gladman, however, claims it doesn't hang on to land and offers it for sale within a couple of months of gaining planning as, under the option system, it only makes money when it is sold.
“The land market is inefficient and fragmented,” says Tom Aubrey, from the Centre for Progressive Capitalism, who argues that these land promoters are a natural product of its dysfunction and lack of transparency. They liken the model of these businesses to private equity firms, as an agile, speculative force. “It's a bit like airlines before the internet was set up: it was difficult to know who had the best price because of the asymmetry of information.”
The Government has signalled it wants to open up the land market, making data on land and who owns it more accessible. According to Shelter's Banks, this “would be a small but very powerful change, which could help the country build the homes we so desperately need.”

Reading through old reviews of Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, there's one complaint the company just can't get away from -- carrier bloatware isn't in the best interest of the user.
For example, AT&T pre-installs DirecTV apps and randomly places ads for its satellite TV service in the notification tray. Verizon places ads as well, encouraging you to visit one of its retail stores. It's annoying, invasive, and something that needs to stop.
The problem isn't limited to just Samsung phones, with all Android device makers giving carriers way too much control over what's pre-installed on a device.
Samsung, however, is a big enough company one would think it could force carriers to take the same approach Apple has achieved with its iPhone line.
That is to say, every Galaxy smartphone would come with zero pre-installed carrier apps and services, and ads would no longer randomly appear in the notification shade for whatever service the carrier is promoting at the time.
Traditionally, the only way for Android smartphone manufacturers to forgo carrier bloatware and interference is to release an unlocked smartphone. Traditionally, those same unlocked smartphones receive software updates before carriers.
In theory, unlocked phones are a win for consumers and a win for the device manufacturer. At least, that's how it's supposed to work.
In 2016, Samsung launched an unlocked version of its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Samsung's pitch was that its unlocked phones provided users choice and flexibility, without bloatware.
Customers assumed the unlocked devices would also see software updates faster than the carrier equivalent. Unfortunately, that's not been the case.
As of this writing, I have an unlocked Galaxy S7 Edge sitting on my desk, still running Android 6.0.1 with the Android security patch from December 1, 2016. Three months worth of security fixes, missing.
Meanwhile, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon have all released Android Nougat 7.0, with many new features and tweaks and current security updates for the S7.
Users are frustrated. Browse through Android fan forums and Samsung's own support forum and you'll find upset unlocked owners who are puzzled by Samsung's approach to software updates on a carrier-free device.
I've found several references from forum users claiming Samsung has committed to a quarterly update schedule, and to expect Nougat on the unlocked S7 in April along with the latest security patches. I reached out to Samsung to verify this but didn't receive a response.
If a quarterly update schedule is true, then owners of unlocked Samsung devices are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to security updates -- arguably the most important aspect of timely software updates.
In Samsung's defense, the company never promised or committed to a faster update schedule. When the unlocked S7 was announced, I pressed the company on the aspect of faster updates and was met with the standard PR line of "nothing further to announce."
I won't pretend to know the nuances of what goes on behind the scenes between device makers and carriers, but there has to be something more Samsung can do here.
Going forward, purchasing an unlocked Samsung Galaxy device isn't something I would recommend to anyone unless the company commits to monthly security updates.
Carrier apps and services are a hassle to deal with, but at this point are the cost of having up-to-date security and features on a smartphone. For now, at least, that's a price I'm willing to pay.
Samsung's Galaxy 8 might have a button for its new AI assistant:
Hollywood Democrats are getting nervous about recent polls that show the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tightening.
“I'm freaked out,” David Schneiderman, co-owner and founder of Seismic Productions and prominent Clinton supporter, told TheWrap. “I now post stuff on Facebook every day bugging all my friends to do something. No one wants to wake up to Donald Trump on November 8.”
A Tuesday CNN/ORC poll showing Trump leading Clinton in a head-to-head match for the first time in six weeks caught some of Clinton's staunchest industry supporters and donors by surprise. It is one of the “big five” polls widely considered the most reliable — though some journalists questioned its methodology.

Clinton enjoyed a significant lead in both national and key swing state polls for weeks after their smooth Democratic National Convention. Trump, meanwhile, was swarmed with negative stories about their fight with a Gold Star family and a $25,000 donation to Florida State Attorney General Pam Bondi as their office considered a lawsuit against Trump University. (She decided not to sue, but denies any impropriety).
In recent weeks, Clinton has faced tough questions about whether they gave preferential treatment to Clinton Foundation donors during their time as secretary of state. And their email scandal won't go away.
Clinton is still up in most polls, but Trump is gaining. Clinton's lead in the polls has shrunk to an average of 3.3 points, according to a RealClearPolitics, down from a peak of 7.9 points a month ago.
“You just never know,” Schneiderman said. “You don't want to rest on your laurels.”

But if the polls are right, Clinton supporters say, that may not be such a bad thing.
“It's just going to get some people to pay more attention,” L.A.-based Democratic strategist and Clinton supporter Donna Bojarsky told TheWrap. “It doesn't change the fundamentals of the race, but, yes, no one should take anything for granted.”
Bojarsky said August fundraising numbers are a good indication that Clinton is on the right track. Clinton smashed their own fundraising record by raising a whopping $143 million last month, compared to Trump's $90 million.
“Fundraising is a kind of voting,” Bojarsky said. “If someone is raising a ton of money, it's a sign of enthusiasm.”
Clinton's supporters also note that she's also leading in key swing states and has even managed to put some historically red states into play. A 50-state Washington Post-SurveyMonkey poll, released Tuesday, showed Trump struggling in states like Arizona, Georgia and even Texas, where he's in a virtual dead heat with Clinton. That will help them in the contest for Electoral College votes, the only race that truly matters.
“You can't look at polls on a day-to-day basis,” Jeff Danis, president of DNP Talent in Beverly Hills, told TheWrap. “Yes, we read all the polls with cautious optimism. We don't want to get too complacent.”
“It's like running a marathon. You may be ahead of the pack, but if you stop and rest you could lose the race,” Danis added.

Still, the fact that Trump is still within striking distance of Clinton is enough to rattle some Democrats.
“We have to work hard to make sure Hillary prevails,” Schneiderman said. “Two months is a long time, but it can go by in the blink of an eye.”

When female Aedes Aegypti mosquito sups on the blood of its human victims it too often deposits the virus that causes dengue, causing as many as 400 million infections per year worldwide. Severe forms of the painful, flu-like disease can be fatal, especially among children. And until recently there has been no truly effective prevention except avoiding getting bit.
But the outlook against the disease is looking better.
During the past month Dengvaxia, developed by the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, has been approved for use in three countries: Mexico and the Philippines approved the vaccine earlier this month. This week, the company also announced the drug has received the green light in Brazil, which has seen more than 1.4 million cases of the disease in 2015. Exactly when the inoculations will be deployed—and at what price—remains unclear as terms of the vaccine are being negotiated between the company and the countries.
Sanofi's vaccine, which is designed to coax the body's immune system into making antibodies against all four forms of dengue, is a live virus comprised of an attenuated yellow fever virus. (Yellow fever virus and dengue virus have the same genus.) For the vaccine, however, the virus is genetically engineered to include genes encoding for dengue proteins. Other dengue vaccines are also in development but none have received approval.
The need for an effective vaccine is evident. The mosquito-borne disease has a massive and growing reach. Dengue has become an increasing threat around the world as both the range of the disease-carrying mosquitoes has grown and people travel to dengue-endemic locations. Health officials have also become better at diagnosing the disease. Dengue has been reported in Japan after a lapse of about 70 years. The number of cases has grown in Brazil and its neighbors. Meanwhile, in the United States, there was an outbreak this year in Hawaii and the disease is already endemic in Puerto Rico.
That's not to say Dengvaxia is a perfect vaccine. In clinical trials it only reduced the chances of developing the disease by about 60 percent. Also, it is only approved for use in people nine to 45 years old who live in dengue-endemic areas —not young children or the elderly. In fact, the vaccine seems to be the least effective in children younger than nine years old, particularly among kids under 6, whose immune systems are especially vulnerable and might be part of the group who need the vaccines most. There are also unanswered questions regarding vaccinated individuals who could potentially have more severe cases of the disease if they contract it later in life.
Even as Brazil and other tropical countries attempt to tamp down dengue with mosquito control and public health campaigns, they are also facing other mosquito-borne threats including chikungunya and, increasingly, zika. The latter disease, which also causes dengue-like symptoms, has recently been linked with babies of infected pregnant mothers being born with abnormally small heads, or microcephaly, in Brazil. Researchers have detected an alarming, inexplicable uptick in such cases in the northeast part of the country. That's in addition to earlier reports, documented by Scientific American, linking zika to another condition that can cause paralysis.
From the U.S. perspective it remains unclear how a vaccine would be used domestically, whether it would be used in areas that already have seen dengue including Hawaii or Florida or perhaps among those traveling to dengue-endemic countries. By law, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cannot comment about if they are reviewing an application for the vaccine to be used in the U.S. But Harold Margolis, chief of the dengue branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the vaccine does appear to be safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials. Still, they have some reservations. “The vaccine has significantly lowed efficacy with dengue 1 and 2 than dengue 3 and 4,” they say, referring to the distinct but closely related strains of the virus. The vaccine may also perform differently in larger settings and communities than it did in clinical trials, they say. In April 2016, World Health Organization immunization advisers will examine the vaccine and provide recommendations for its use. Ultimately, Margolis says, "the U.S. is interested in having a vaccine that prevents disease."
Anti-choice campaigners might leap on my story or the notion of prenatal depression as an argument against abortion, pointing out that women who experience this can't trust their emotions — that if they terminate their pregnancies when they're suffering from a temporary bout of depression, they will regret it later. But not every woman who is depressed wants an abortion, nor does every woman who wants an abortion feel depressed. An unwanted pregnancy is one thing — and I support a woman's right to choose how to handle that, if it happens. A very much wanted pregnancy that leads to a sudden and extreme change in emotional state and behavior demands examination — and for that, we need awareness. I found very little information online. The majority of what I did find was on parenting sites, which a depressed pregnant woman may be inclined to avoid.We hear a lot about postnatal depression, and medical professionals are trained to spot it, but even when I asked my doctor whether I might be suffering from prenatal depression, it was basically met with a shrug. (That said, I was living in England at the time, where standards of care may be slightly different — Europe is known to have a significant “treatment gap” when it comes to mental health.) I chose not to press the point with them or seek another opinion, still hoping the condition would resolve itself.There's no single explanation as to why this happens, or to whom, and the causes may range from hormonal changes to stress to other prenatal health issues, with varying severity and duration. In a perfect world, all pregnant women would be routinely screened for depression and anxiety. In fact, a 2015 opinion from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that clinicians should screen all pregnant patients for depression and anxiety symptoms at least once, partly because the fallout from this problem can be dead-serious: maternal suicide is a bigger cause of maternal mortality than hemorrhage or hypertensive disorders, ACOG notes. While taking antidepressants may not be 100% safe for pregnant women (they should weigh the risks and benefits with their doctors, especially if they took the drugs before becoming pregnant), psychotherapy can be helpful — but only if the problem is detected, of course.My depression lasted 13 weeks — until one day, for no obvious reason, I just felt better. Unfortunately, this was not before depression had stolen another milestone: I went for my 12-week scan, trying to ignore the hormonally induced hope for either a phantom pregnancy or one that couldn't proceed. Luckily, the screen showed what it was supposed to: a black-and-white moving thing with a recognizable skull. If anybody noticed I wasn't feeling what I was supposed to, they didn't say.Once I began to feel like myself again, the rest of my pregnancy went well, and I made up for my “missed” scans with a 3D scan at 29 weeks. I watched the baby open their mouth and blink, and seem to smile and wave in utero, and I felt overwhelmed by joy. All the happy emotions I had been unable to summon during that first trimester had finally arrived. Sitting here now, next to a perfect, sleeping angel of a baby boy, writing about how I once hoped for a mother-to-be's worst nightmare, I feel sickened by the ingratitude. But it wasn't me; it was an illness. The same hormones that were helping my body create a life were trying to kill it in my mind.
Americans hate Comcast. The Internet and cable giant routinely shows up or tops the list of America's worst companies. So this should come as no surprise: Comcast is America's most-hated Internet provider.
The dubious distinction is based on the number of consumer complaints related to Internet availability, billing and speed that were submitted to the Federal Communications Commission from Jan. 1 to Nov. 9. According to data compiled by Ars Technica, the FCC received more Internet complaints about Comcast than it did for top rivals Verizon, AT&T and Time Warner Cable combined.
At first glance, it seems to make sense that Comcast, the nation's largest Internet and cable provider, has the highest number of angry customers. But Comcast's three smaller competitors combined have roughly 15 million more customers than the telecommunications giant, so Comcast also led the way in terms of complaints per customer.
The FCC received 11,812 complaints about Comcast in the first 10 months of 2015 (through Nov. 9) compared with the combined total of 6,742 for the other three telecom companies.
That's right. Comcast had nearly doubled the number of angry consumers as the combined total of Verizon (1,588), AT&T (3,896) and TWC (1,240).
Yikes. That's a lot of unhappy Comcast customers. Says Ars Technica:
Comcast gets complaints about many things, but frustration with its 300GB-per-month data cap and its overage charges appear to drive much of the most recent outrage. (AT&T also imposes data caps ranging from 150GB to 1TB a month, but the 150GB cap on entry-level DSL is reportedly the only one that's enforced. Verizon and TWC don't limit data usage as strictly as Comcast.)
Comcast issued this statement to Ars Technica regarding consumers' data cap complaints:
“We are conducting data trials in select markets around the country, covering a small percentage of our customers. We designed the various plans we are trialing with a minimum 300GB/month data plan because more than 90 percent of our customers use fewer data than that and are not affected. The trials are providing us with invaluable consumer feedback. For example, we surveyed our heavy data users and 80 percent thought our data trials were fairer than our past approach, which was a 250GB/month static cap. It's important to note that 10 percent of our customers are consuming nearly 50 percent of all the data on our network. As a result, these trials are based on the principle that those who use more, pay more and those who use less, pay less.”
Comcast also received dismal ratings in the newly released American Customer Satisfaction Index.

Japanese Internet Giant GMO Offers to Pay 4700+ Employees in Bitcoin
Japanese conglomerate GMO Internet Group has introduced a payroll system to allow its 4,700+ employees to receive part of their salaries in bitcoin.

GMO Introduces Bitcoin Salary Payment System
Japanese Internet leader GMO Group has announced that its employees can start receiving part of their salaries in bitcoin beginning in February of next year for the March pay period. This option will initially only be available to employees of GMO Internet Co. Ltd but it will gradually extend to the entire group, the company detailed in its announcement on Monday. According to the company's website, GMO Internet has 4,710 full-time employees as of September this year.
The company also listed 42 subsidiaries on its website which are part of the GMO Group. They include GMO Coin, the company's cryptocurrency subsidiary, and GMO Click, one of the world's largest FX platforms.
In order to facilitate salary payments in bitcoin, the company explained:
The GMO Internet Group has decided to introduce a system that allows part of the salary payment to be received as bitcoin in order to promote ownership of our domestic employees' virtual currency.
The minimum bitcoin payment will initially be 10,000 yen (~$88) and the upper limit will be 100,000 yen (~$881). Each salary payment in yen will be reduced by the amount of bitcoin payment paid, using the exchange rate at the GMO Coin exchange. Employees who create an account at the GMO Coin exchange “can receive bitcoin on the same day as their payday,” Nikkei described.
GMO Promoting Crypto From Within
Following the launch of its cryptocurrency trading platform in May, GMO announced in September its plans to begin a mining business. The company plans to spend 10 billion yen in the next few years to build a mining farm as well as to research and develop 7nm, 5nm, and 3.5nm mining chips. In October, GMO announced that it plans to sell mining boards equipped with 7nm chips using token sales.
In Monday's announcement, the company stated, “The mining business is currently preparing for the start of business beginning in January 2018.”
“The GMO Internet Group will contribute to the development of virtual currencies in the world by promoting efforts related to virtual currency throughout the group,” the company noted, adding that:
In order to further strengthen these approaches to virtual currency, it is important for employees to actively use virtual currency first by improving [their] virtual currency literacy.

Each year, thousands of talented Australian entrepreneurs come pouring out of the woodwork, starting fresh new startups with bold ideas, and seeking funding, customers, or just recognition.
Those entrepreneurs are the backbone of Australia's startup ecosystem, and often once they find one success, they dive back in, seeking another.
While it's impossible to recognise every promising new startup, the team at StartupSmart has compiled a short list of 10 of the most prominent that have caught our eye over the year.
The people behind these startups are some of the brightest, most successful, or most promising founders that, even in such a tumultuous and fast-moving industry, we think are set to achieve great things over the course of 2018.
Checkbox | Evan Wong
Founder of regtech platform Checkbox Evan Wong admits he's not at the “serial” stage of entrepreneurship yet, but with two businesses under their belt at the age of just 24, they appear to be well on theirs way.
Checkbox is one of those businesses, and the legislation digitising platform recently won the grand prize at the annual StartCon pitch competition, which means the team will go on to represent Australia on the world stage at Startup World Cup in 2018. Checkbox was also named regtech of the year at the 2017 Australian FinTech Awards and was a 2017 Westpac Innovation Challenge winner.
Wong says they and their team aren't scared of the challenge before them, but with an ever-growing list of accolades under their belt, they say they can feel the pressure and isn't letting it get to him.
“You see businesses who win a bunch of awards but they were all three years ago, and you wonder what's happened since then. We're not going to be that business, I'm confident about our products and meeting everyone's expectations as we move into 2018,” Wong recently told StartupSmart.
:Different | Mina Radhakrishnan and Ruwin Perera
The property market has been a popular target for disruptive startups this year, with ventures such as Hometime and Snug diving in to try to ease some of the pains of Australia's bulging property market.
Newly founded startup :Different is, well, no different. The company is looking to make renting and property management easier for mum and dad property owners, and is headed up by Google and Uber alumni Mina Radhakrishnan and Ruwin Perera. The two founders recently completed a $1.3 million seed round and have seen an uptake of the platform to the point they had to disable their advertising.
According to Radhakrishnan and Perera, “there's no better place in the world to build a high-growth startup” than Australia.
“Australia is one of the richest countries in the world per capita, and there are 24 million affluent consumers willing to take a punt on new technology. Aussie consumers are some of the most willing to embrace new tech when it's made available to them,” Perera told StartupSmart.
CancerAid | Nikhil Pooviah and Raghav Murali-Ganesh
It's been a hell of a year for the founders of personalised cancer patient care app CancerAid, after closing a $1.25 million funding round at the end of 2016, receiving further investment from investor Glen Richards on Shark Tank, and being named as a “standout launch” by Apple on its app store.
Recently, the team also won 2017's Talent Unleashed awards, being judged by an expert panel including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Virgin founder Richard Branson. The team won a trip to Silicon Valley to meet global startup leaders and pitch their cancer resources app.
Prior to winning the award, co-founder Raghav Murali Ganesh said the “ideal scenario” would be to win the awards and use the opportunity to “meet global leaders, learn from experienced individuals both at home and abroad [and] raise the profile of the work we are doing”.
“Our goal is to make CancerAid the number one resource for patients when faced with a cancer diagnosis or undergoing therapy to improve their outcomes and satisfaction,” they told StartupSmart.
Mentorloop | Lucy Lloyd and Heidi Holmes
After closing a $725,000 funding round last month, mentor “dating” startup Mentorloop has now raised over $1 million and landed a number of big-name partnerships, including with Monash University and the Australian Olympic Committee.
This, coupled with a 500% revenue growth over 2017, sets Lucy Lloyd and Heidi Holmes' company up for a big 2018. The plan is to focus on further expanding their mentoring connecting options to cross-company mentoring, and eventually opening up the platform to anyone looking for a mentor.
“We see clients really underestimate the demand for mentoring in their organisations, and in the same way we've kind of underestimated the demand for our platform,” Lloyd told StartupSmart.
“We're trying to grow sensibly. We don't want to suddenly be a 25-person team.”
Power Ledger | Dave Martin and Jemma Green
The year may well be known in history as the year of the blockchain, as a rise to prominence for the emerging technology has seen absurdities such as $24,000 Bitcoins, and companies raising $35 million in 30 seconds through explosive initial coin offerings (ICOs).
One of Australia's first and most successful ICOs was completed by the Power Ledger team, which managed to raise $34 million in investment to help build their power-trading-on-the-blockchain company. But that wasn't the end of the company's wins: it also recently locked down part of an $8 million federal government Smart Cities grant to help roll out its tech in Fremantle.
Co-founder Jemma Green says there are plenty of positives on the horizon for Power Ledger, telling StartupSmart the focus of the company is to increase use cases for its tradeable POWR token.
“We've got a pipeline of projects we're working on which will hopefully see an increase in utilisation for the POWR token. That's the focus of the business — create projects which will increase the use of the POWR token,” they said.
1scope | Christina Chun
Christina Chun's education tech startup 1scope turned some heads earlier this year after it locked in $1 million in seed funding while the platform was still in beta — an achievement Chun said was hinged on advice from a number of advisors, including an Atlassian executive.
“I had to surround myself with people who had run large companies or done deals like these before,” Chun told StartupSmart in March.
The social enterprise startup has since launched out of beta, with Chun and their team moving into offices in Sydney's Barangaroo district. They told The Australian the goal is to get 34,000 students on the platform to help them access training, work experience, and job opportunities.
“We want as many students to use the site as possible and we want as many companies who are running programs to be involved,” Chun said.
CanYa | John-Paul Thorbjornsen and Christopher McLoughlin
Services marketplace app CanYa was built with cryptocurrencies in mind, allowing users on the service to pay, and be paid in, currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. It only made sense then for the company to launch its own currency via an ICO, which so far has raised upwards of $2.3 million.
With the raise set to close by the end of this month, CanYa's year ahead will be focused on putting that capital to good use and delivering for its customers. The team wants to prove to backers it is committed to the project, in contrast to those blockchain projects released this year they say have been “nothing but a whitepaper”.
“We want to build a strong community, and give people benefits for being long-term believers in CanYa. This model's never been done before so we're finding our feet, but it's gotten some incredible reception,” co-founder Thorbjornsen told StartupSmart.
Hyper Anna | Natalie Nguyen and Sam Zheng
Mixing two of 2017's ‘hot topics' for startups — fintech and artificial intelligence — Sydney startup Hyper Anna validated its product and concept through a $16 million capital raise in August, becoming one of the largest local fintech raises this year along the way.
Big name clients such as Westpac and IAG helped the startup secure investment, with co-founder and chief executive Natalie Nguyen telling StartupSmart the capital will be used to help expand the startup's offerings internationally. Billed as “Siri for analytics”, Hyper Anna has built a “virtual data scientist” offering ‘Anna', which answers questions about business performance and analyses data.
“Larger organisations have really woken up to the value of working with smaller organisations whose sole focus is solving a particular type of problem, often niche problems,” Nguyen said.
Finch | Toby Gardner and Shahirah Gardner
Finch founders Shahirah and Toby Gardner are some of the latest Aussie-born entrepreneurs returning from the wilds of Silicon Valley to launch their startup Down Under, with the two joining forces to launch millennial-focused financial management app Finch after studying together in California.
And just three months after officially launching their product, the two received a “Silicon Valley-sized” seed round of $2.25 million. Planning is already underway for a $10 million Series A round for 2018.
“We consider ourselves a professional startup and because of that we recognise what investors are looking for and the risks involved. We were very conscious of making sure we chose the right investment money. We're very happy to see the Australian investment community providing the capital we needed,” Toby Gardner told StartupSmart.
Most of the funding will be put towards further marketing for the duo's app.
Zambesi | Rebekah Campbell
Startup-focused education startup Zambesi is the most recent venture to come from entrepreneur Rebekah Campbell, who's most well known for creating mobile ordering and payments provider Hey You, which they merged with ordering platform Beat the Q.
Zambesi was born largely from Campbell's own success as an entrepreneur. They told StartupSmart they were being contacted by many founders who would ask for coffee catch-ups to receive advice from her, but they found the interactions were not in depth enough to provide real help.
“We were thinking we could rent out our extra room on Airbnb, and I thought, ‘why don't I rent out my skills in raising capital?'” they said.
Zambesi has received a $25,000 grant from Jobs for NSW and launched officially in October with sessions from big names including Shoes of Prey co-founder Mike Knapp, Canva's head of growth Andre Pinatoan, and Fleur Brown from TEDxSydney.

PUNE: Scam-tainted Suresh Kalmadi was on Monday ousted as the President of the Asian Athletics Association after they lost their re-election bid to Qatar's powerful rival Dahlan Jumaan Al-Hamad in a tight contest, bringing an end to the veteran administrator's 13-year reign at the helm.Kalmadi, who was jailed and later released on bail for their alleged role in the Commonwealth Games scam, lost 18-20 in the presidential elections held on the second and final day of the AAA Congress at a five-star hotel.All the 45 member countries of the AAA voted through secret ballot in the presence of international parent body IAAF chief Lamine Diack. There were seven invalid votes. Each country has one vote in the election.Kalmadi, a former Indian Olympic Association President, will, however, continue as a member of the IAAF Council till 2015 but will no longer be an area representative from the continental body.Today's defeat also marked the end of 69-year-old Congress MP's career as a sports administrator as they have already quit from any such post in the country last year after they were charge-sheeted and jailed for their alleged role in the CWG scandal.The electoral reverse has now led to speculation on whether they would now announce retirement from sports administration since they no longer has any posts.He will though automatically become a life president of the AAA, an honorary post given to all past presidents, and can attend the Congress of the continental body without any voting rights.Qatar Athletics Federation President Al Hamad, who is also the incumbent senior vice-president of the AAA as well as the IAAF, will hold office for just two years instead of four.An AAA source said that the term of its president was curtailed so that it runs concurrently with that of the IAAF chief and it will revert to four years from 2015 onwards."There are a lot of opportunities in Asia which we still do not utilise. I see the opportunity is there, but we are not trying to bring that opportunity through constructive planning. We lack in marketing side," Al Hamad had said."The IAAF has many Asian sponsors. But AAA is not sponsored by anybody. And why? Because we are not prepared. We don't have that final product to present. That's why we have to have it."And I believe that business people don't come to you unless you are really prepared and you have the right product for them. So we need to have the right product for them, the right programme, the right staff, and then businesses come."The Kalmadi camp said they had done a lot for the growth of athletics in the last 13 years by increasing the number of competition."Before 2000, there were just two competitions -- Asian Junior and Asian Senior Championships. Now we have so many other competitions -- Asian Grand Prix Series, Asian All Star, Asian Marathon, Asian Walk Championships. So they have done a lot for Asian Athletics," an official from the Kalmadi camp had said.
A 20-year-old eunuch was allegedly kidnapped, assaulted, tortured with burning cigarettes and gangraped by three men in a moving vehicle between Kurla and Ghatkopar in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The police arrested one of the three accused and have launched a manhunt for the other two.
According to the VB Nagar police, the victim stays with two roommates in Kurla. On Wednesday night the victim had gone to a hotel in Kurla to pick up food, when the accused drew up in a Maruti Van.
"The accused threatened to kill one of my associates if I refused to comply with their demands. I told my roommates to go home and got into the vehicle, after which they forced themselves on me in the moving car," they said in their statement to police.
After around three hours, the accused allegedly threw the victim out of the moving vehicle in Ghatkopar, after which the victim made their way to Rajawadi hospital and was admitted. The hospital authorities informed Ghatkopar police and a team of officers reached the hospital to record the victim's statement.
After it became clear that the abduction occurred in the jurisdiction of VB Nagar police, the case was transferred to them.
"The victim said they knew one of the three men, and identified them as Mubarak. We registered a complaint of kidnapping, criminal intimidation and unnatural sex against the three accused," said Police Inspector N Shivle, VB Nagar police station.
The victim was allegedly burnt with cigarette butts and some kind of chemical was poured on their body, and the police are awaiting medical reports to check if these claims are true.
After a day-long operation, the police picked up Mubarak Sheikh (25) from the Amrut Nagar slums in Ghatkopar. After being questioned, they were placed under arrest on Thursday evening. DCP (Zone 5) Dhananjay Kulkarni confirmed the arrest.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The deputy first minister called it a "landmark" day in the fight against homelessness
Legislation which aims to effectively end homelessness in Scotland has come into force.
The change entitles anyone finding themselves homeless through no fault of their own to settled accommodation.
Previously, only those classed as being in priority need - often families with children - had that right.
It meets Scotland's historic 2012 homelessness commitment, first set 10 years ago by the Labour/Lib Dem government.
The change, passed unanimously last month under the Homelessness (Abolition of Priority Need Test) (Scotland) Order 2012, will give an estimated 3,000 more people a year the right to settled accommodation.
As the changes came into force, the deputy first minister also announced £300,000 would be spent over the next two years to help councils with their efforts to prevent homelessness.
'Heartache and trauma'
Nicola Sturgeon said: "This is a landmark day in the fight against homelessness.
"I know the heartache and trauma of homelessness from working closely with households faced with the prospect of losing the roof over their head.
"Meeting our 2012 commitment guarantees that those who lose their home from no fault of their own will be guaranteed settled accommodation.
"It is absolutely right to offer this guarantee in a time of crisis for people. It sends the signal that we are there to help, there is hope and that the state will do what it can."
Official figures from February 2012 suggested the number of homeless people in Scotland is at its lowest for a decade.
Graeme Brown, director of the housing and homelessness charity Shelter Scotland, said: "Scotland can be very proud that it is making history by meeting the 2012 commitment - which is internationally regarded as the cutting edge of progressive homelessness reform.
"I congratulate all the local authorities who have made widespread changes in order to meet their new responsibilities to homeless people."

The L.A. Department of Water and Power plans to start draining 400 million gallons of water from the reservoir late this month or early next month.
The DWP says it needs to remove all of the water to replace a huge water pipe that's buried underneath the reservoir. Of course, during a drought, that's far too much water to pour down the drain. So the DWP will install portable filtration units to purify the water and then put it back into the city's drinking water system.
The reservoir will be empty for about a year. After that it will be refilled with water that's not suitable for drinking. The 66-inch steel pipeline that's being replaced will connect to a new reservoir – called Headworks – that's being built on the other side of the Hollywood Hills, near Griffith Park.
The DWP disconnected the Silver Lake Reservoir from the city's drinking water system two years ago. That was after the federal government ordered the phase out of all open-air reservoirs because of exposure to runoff and other pollution.
The reservoir was last drained seven years ago because the water became contaminated with bromate, a carcinogen that forms when naturally occurring chemicals mix with sunlight and chlorine. To prevent more contamination, city officials dumped thousands of floating black plastic balls into the reservoir to help shade the water.
The latest draining comes as the city and neighborhood groups debate the future of the 110-year-old landmark. Some residents are even pushing to turn the reservoir into a swimming lake.
Meanwhile, it's expected to take several weeks to empty the reservoir once the DWP pulls the plug.
Log Cabin Republicans battle with CPAC organizers
Log Cabin Republicans claim they have been shunned by the Conservative Political Action Conference — again.
“Make no mistake: LCR is actively being prohibited from sponsoring CPAC,” the group's national Executive Director Gregory T. Angelo said in a statement Thursday.
Story Continued Below
The organizers of the annual conference, which begins Feb. 25, hotly deny that and say they are dedicated to creating an inclusive event.
This is the third consecutive year that the Log Cabin Republicans — a group representing gay conservatives — have alleged that they have been blocked from sponsoring CPAC. Before 2013, when Angelo became executive director, the Log Cabin Republicans sponsored CPAC-related events (such as a “ Scotch and Cigars” reception in 2012) but did not sponsor the main conference itself.
Angelo said that The American Conservative Union — the group that organizes CPAC —“has the right to invite or not invite whoever they want to [CPAC], but they should be honest about the reasons why.”
The Log Cabin Republicans accuse the ACU of “hiding behind a fig leaf stating gay people are welcome as guests” — when actually, they say, the intention is the opposite. According to Angelo, their group has tried to sign on as a CPAC sponsor “time and again” and has met the criteria for doing so but has been denied for various reasons.
“The only conclusion that can be made is that the organizers of CPAC do not feel gay people can be conservative,” Angelo wrote, rattling off a laundry list of conservative positions their group has taken in recent years.
ACU fired back in a statement to POLITICO on Thursday saying that the Log Cabin Republicans did not even apply to be co-sponsors for the 2015 event.
“Had they applied, they would have been subjected to the same review as every other application,” ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp said. “All conservatives, including gay conservatives, are welcome to be at CPAC. In fact, we have invited main stage and break out panelists who are conservative and gay, and we thank them for their contribution to our movement and CPAC 2015.”
In an interview with POLITICO, Schlapp doubled down on their statement, saying that inclusion of conservatives with a variety of viewpoints has been a focus of theirs since they assumed their role as chairperson.
“I want to be a chairperson that doesn't shut down discussion but encourages discussion, especially among conservatives,” they said.
Schlapp said that while the Log Cabin Republicans were never denied sponsorship, the group disagrees with ACU on whether the Republican party should become more conservative or more moderate.
“It's a great discussion to have, but at CPAC it's about bringing conservatives together,” they said. “It's not a Republican event, it's a conservative event.”
Organizers also say that CPAC is, for the first time, publicly encouraging gay conservatives to attend. Two openly gay conservative commentators are scheduled to address the crowd from the main stage: Radio host Tammy Bruce will speak on strategic communications, and how conservatives can get their message out; and columnist Deroy Murdock will talk on “America's Security in the Age of Jihad.”
“If we didn't want to include gay people at CPAC, we wouldn't be including gay people at CPAC, and we are,” Schlapp said.
Changes coming on Caps beat
As you have probably heard by now, my run as Caps beat writer is coming to an end after five years.
I'm terrible with goodbyes, so I'll keep this brief. It's been an honor and privilege to cover the hockey team I grew up watching for the newspaper I grew up reading. But the time has come for me to seek out new challenges and, equally important, spend more time at home after living out of a suitcase every fall, winter and spring since Oct. 2005.
I'm not leaving The Post. I'm simply changing gears and will report on other sports I'm just as passionate about: college hoops (Georgetown basketball specifically) and auto racing (NASCAR and the Indy 500). I'll also take on boxing, action sports, MMA and will help out on hockey in the playoffs and whenever else I'm needed.
Don't worry, Capitals Insider isn't going anywhere. In the coming weeks, Katie Carrera will transition into their new role as lead reporter on the blog and in the paper. Please join me in welcoming them Also, if you're not already, you can follow Katie on Twitter at @WPKatieCarrera.
Again, thanks for five great years and helping this blog become more popular than anyone fathomed when I pitched the idea in 2006. I'm excited about my new role -- and the fact that the hockey team I'll follow this winter will be my six-year-old son's mite squad.
Bill Would Allow Tracking of Nevada Gun Owners Movements
This message is urgent and we need your action immediately.
The Nevada State Special Session of the Legislature meets this week on Tuesday. They are looking for ways to fill the budget deficit and don't think they have overlooked the cash that has been spent on guns and ammo in the last year.
Nevada –-(AmmoLand.com)- The legislature is considering a means of “revenue enhancement” that would make privacy for CCW holders a huge problem. This is the exact same bill that was rejected by the legislature last year.
InsureNet is lobbying for this bill so they can install 1,000's of camera or “scanners” on nearly all of Nevada's public roads. If it passes it would allow InsureNet, to photograph/scan every license plate on our roads. This data would be scanned and analyzed by InsureNet for the purpose of catching uninsured motorists. It's a nice premise but it comes with some serious problems.
The problem is, in Nevada, every CCW holder has essentially given up his/her right to privacy. The minute you ask the government for “permission” to lawfully carry concealed, your license plate and vehicle registration is noted as a CCW holder. In other words, those who have jumped through the hoops of paying for the privilege to carry a lawful firearm—these lawful gun owners would be captured by an unaccountable, out of state corporate entities database! We constantly hear of databases being hacked.
Do you understand the ramifications of this bill? Can you see the possibility for misuse? Gun owners did not create the spending problem at the state level. And gun owners should not have to fear privacy violations by an out-of-state corporation just because of being a CCW holder.
You know how unaccountable our state legislators can be to gun owners. A private business has even less accountability to you. What if someday we have a truly anti-gun Governor (think Obama)? What if the Governor wanted to know which CCW holders were at a particular “political rally?” Do you see the problems this can cause now and in the future? This bill must NOT be the answer to our states over-spending. Gun owners need to tell their legislative representatives that the right to privacy as a gun owner is already too heavily compromised by the Unconstitutional permit system.
Nevadans do not need more cameras taking pictures of our auto license plates. Of course everyone needs to have car insurance. But this idea is being introduced because our state government is spending money like the proverbial drunken sailors that they are. Lawful concealed carry holders should not be subjected to this level of potential violation of privacy.
When the Nevada state legislature did not pass this bill last year, they were thinking clearly. They are not thinking clearly now. They are seeing dollars signs and they are NOT thinking of you or your CCW.
Do NOT allow them to pass this bill that would make it too easy for the rights of law abiding gun owners like you to be violated.
Contact your representatives immediately.
Tell them “NO to InsureNet”. Tell them NO to scanning our license plates.
Tell them that until lawful Nevada gun owners can carry a self defense weapon as they do in Alaska (permit optional) that you do NOT want any type of ‘scanning' of license plates. Constitutional Carry (permit optional) is moving ahead in Iowa, Arizona, Texas and many other states. Why not Nevada?
They need to hear from you. Spread the word. Do not just post this message on bulletin boards and forums. Do not just email this message to your gun buddies. You must call. It is imperative.
Emails are great but it is really too late. If you are going to email, please go here.
http://www.leg.state.nv.us/assembly/feedbackmail.cfm
Or email all of them at once by cutting and pasting this:
If you can, please email and call.
Here are the most important phone and contact information. A suggested message follows.
In the Assembly please contact:
In the Senate please contact:
******************************************* Dear Member of the Nevada Legislature: During this Special Session, fix the budget problem without scanning license plates. I believe everyone should have auto insurance but I do not want an out of State Corporation to set up 1,000's of cameras on Nevada roads. Privacy is too important to be entrusted to a no-bid contract with InsureNet or with any other private company. Sincerely, *******************************************

Thirteen English league clubs support reintroducing standing at football grounds, according to a fans' group.
On Tuesday, the Football Supporters' Federation is hoping to win the backing of MPs for its plans for a small-scale trial at Premier League clubs.
It believes the pilot scheme would show standing - outlawed after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 - is now a safe way to watch football.

FSF's Peter Daykin said: "We need to find out if it can work and the only way to do that is to trial it."
But a Premier League statement says they will "not be encouraging the Government to change the law".
It reads: "Since the introduction of all-seater stadia the supporter experience has improved significantly and we have seen more diverse crowds attending Premier League matches, including more women and children.
"The police, safety officers and licensing authorities remain clear and have consistently informed us that crowd management has improved as a result of all-seater stadiums being in place in the top two divisions in this country."
All-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the Premier League since 1994, following Lord Justice Taylor's report after the Hillsborough disaster.
But MP Roger Godsiff has tabled an Early Day Motion calling for government approval of a pilot scheme.
The FSF says the idea has the support of Aston Villa and the Scottish Premier League plus 12 Football League clubs, including Cardiff City, Crystal Palace, Derby County and Hull City.
I feel insulted that people are trying to fight for justice for Hillsborough while this campaign is growing Margaret Aspinall Chair of Hillsborough Family Support Group
The proposal is to introduce a design of "rail seat" currently used in some European countries such as Germany. This incorporates a safety barrier and a flip-down seat on every other row. The seats can be locked in an upright position, meaning two rows of supporters can stand in between the barriers, which reduces the danger of a crush.
This type of standing area would also be able to be converted to seating for European competitions, where all-seater stadiums are required.
A panel of industry experts containing Villa's chief executive Paul Faulkner and West Midlands Police Force Superintendent Steve Graham will present a case for allowing standing at matches at Portcullis House in Westminster on Tuesday.
FSF's safe standing co-ordinator Daykin told BBC Sport: "The debate about standing has reached a point where both sides are entrenched.
"Things have changed dramatically since 23 years ago when the Taylor Report was produced.
"They have moved on massively in terms of technology and know-how around safety in football grounds.
"What we are calling for is a number of small-scale trials at Premier League clubs up and down the country.
"Then experts, safety officers and the police can see how it works in a modern context.
"We have had 50 MPs sign up to Roger Godsiff's EDM and correspondence showing support from more MPs unable to sign."
The campaign for the introduction of safe-standing areas has already met with some opposition from the chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
"There are 96 reasons why it should not be allowed," said Margaret Aspinall, whose son died at Hillsborough.
"Standing should never, ever come back. I do not think there is anything safe about standing.
"I feel insulted that people are trying to fight for justice for Hillsborough while this campaign is growing."
Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor said on Monday that clubs might have to introduce netting around pitches to protect players.
Taylor was speaking after Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object as their side celebrated the winning goal against Manchester City on Sunday.
There is no member of Congress representing the southwest border areas that currently supports Trump's request for nearly one and a half billion dollars to begin construction of a wall along the border with Mexico. The congressional members whose districts are most likely to be affected — both Republican and Democratic — have voiced concerns that seem obvious to many: this is an ill-considered plan and likely to be a reckless use of taxpayer dollars.
To date, most of what the public has heard about the president's plans for the border wall has come out through their tweets, which began on the campaign trail. On Nov. 22, 2015, they tweeted, “13 Syrian refugees were caught trying to get into the U.S. through the Southern Border. How many made it? WE NEED THE WALL!”
ADVERTISEMENT
On Aug. 27, 2016, they wrote, “Heroin overdoses are taking over our children and others in the MIDWEST. Coming in from our southern border. We need strong border & WALL!” On Jan. 29, they tweeted, “Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world — a horrible mess!”
Trump's communications on this matter point to a variety of different “policy problems,” for example, suggesting we need a wall to prevent refugees from entering the country through improper channels (or at least 13 of them), to combat heroin overdoses, and to stop some kind of “horrible mess” that they see transpiring around the world.
Not surprisingly, lawmakers such as Rep. Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) have been asking for a more comprehensive analysis and approach to addressing border security concerns. A respectable policy analysis would first ask: What factors shape the activities or behaviors that cause the problem or condition we are trying to address? Factors that lead Syrian refugees to seek protection at our borders are likely very different than those that lead Midwesterners to overdose from heroin or immigrants to cross our border illegally. How is building a wall going to be the most effective way to address each of these?
And are there potential unintended consequences? Will Syrian refugees linger in squalid camps where they will be more vulnerable to radicalization? Will heroin reach the United States instead through our ports? Will undocumented immigrants find new routes around the southern border to enter? What will be the effects on the U.S. economy of stymieing border traffic and exchange?
Importantly, the development of a viable plan must consider arguments about what values are relevant to the problem and alternative actions that might more effectively achieve the agreed-upon goals. It is the responsibility of our congressional leaders and staff, federal agencies, and other interested parties to investigate and propose those policy alternatives and to provide sufficient detail about them so that their impacts can be predicted in relation to their goals. And, of course, the public needs to know whether the magnitude of the predicted impacts will justify the costs to taxpayers.
Existing estimates of the cost of the wall's construction — not factoring in maintenance or any negative externalities, such as the costs of reduced trade or labor mobility — range from $12 billion to $25 billion. These costs are very far from trivial. Still, the president implicitly argues that these costs are not relevant under the principle of “America First” because they would (eventually) be paid by Mexico.
It is clear that Mexico has no plans to generously bequeath the wall to the United States, and any actions that the United States takes to induce Mexico to pay — such as levying a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico — will involve costs to U.S. citizens. Analysts and politicians alike know to be skeptical of claims about a free lunch.
Importantly, we appeal for the type of careful policy analysis that we have described here for all policy proposals coming out of the Trump administration to preserve a role for evidence and informed decision making in government policy making and action. Executive orders, such as those we have seen to date, will need appropriations from Congress to execute, along with personnel and other resources to implement, and will have to abide by existing laws.
We have already seen the chaos that can result when executive orders, such as Trump's travel ban, called “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry,” are discharged without sufficient information, analysis, and planning. In effect, we call for the administration to swallow some of its own medicine and send its policies through some extreme vetting.

In this Japanese name , the family name is Shibusawa.
Shibusawa Eiichi, before 1913
Shibusawa Eiichi, 1st Viscount Shibusawa (渋沢 栄一, March 16, 1840 – November 11, 1931) was a Japanese industrialist widely known today as the "father of Japanese capitalism". They spearheaded the introduction of Western capitalism to Japan after the Meiji Restoration. They introduced many economic reforms including use of double-entry accounting, joint-stock corporations and modern note-issuing banks.[1]
They founded the first modern bank based on joint stock ownership in Japan. The bank was aptly named The First National Bank (Dai Ichi Kokuritsu Ginkō, now merged into Mizuho Bank) and had the power to issue its own notes. Through this bank, they founded hundreds of other joint stock corporations in Japan. Many of these companies still survive to this day as quoted companies in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which Shibusawa also founded. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry was founded by them as well. They were also involved in the foundation of many hospitals, schools, universities (including the first women's university), the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo and charitable organizations including the Japan Red Cross.[1]
Another notable aspect of Shibusawa's career is that, despite being the founder of hundreds of corporations, they refused to maintain a controlling stake in these corporations, effectively preventing themselves from forming a zaibatsu. What is known as the Shibusawa zaibatsu was a holding company to look after their estate for their family. The Shibusawa Zaibatsu did not hold any controlling stake in any companies. Despite their lowly origin as a farmer, they were granted the title of Viscount, while all other zaibatsu founders were awarded the title of Baron. They were also awarded Shōnii, Second Honour under the ritsuryō rank system, which is usually given to high-ranking nobility and prime ministers.
Life [ edit ]
Shibusawa was born on March 16, 1840 in a farmhouse in Chiaraijima (located in the present-day city of Fukaya in Saitama Prefecture). As a boy, they learned reading and writing from their father. They grew up helping with the family business of dry field farming, indigo production and sale, and silk raising and later studied the Confucian classics and the history of Japan under Odaka Junchu, a scholar who was their cousin.
Under the influence of sonnō jōi (expel the barbarians; revere the emperor) sentiment, they formulated a plan along with cousins and friends to capture Takasaki Castle and set fires in the foreign settlement in Yokohama. Ultimately, however, this plan was canceled and they moved on to Kyoto.
Shibusawa left their hometown at the age of twenty-three, and entered the service of Hitotsubashi Yoshinobu (then in line for the position of shōgun). They distinguished themselves by their work in strengthening the household finances of the Hitotsubashi family.
When they were twenty-seven years old, they visited France and other European countries as a member of Tokugawa Akitake's delegation to the Paris World Exposition, 1867. On this trip Shibusawa observed modern European societies and cultures for the first time, and realized the importance of industrial and economic development.
After returning from Europe at the news of the change of governments now known as the Meiji Restoration, they established the Shōhō Kaishō, one of the first joint-stock companies in Japan, in Shizuoka Prefecture. Afterwards, they were invited by the Meiji government to become a member of the Ministry of Finance, where they became a driving force in the building of a modern Japan as head of the Kaisei Kakari, or office of the Ministry of Finance in charge of reform.
In 1873 Shibusawa resigned from the Ministry of Finance and became the president of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (First National Bank). This was Japan's first modern bank, established under their own guidance while still employed by the Ministry of Finance. With this bank as a base, Shibusawa devoted themselves to founding and encouraging businesses of all sorts.
Shibusawa was an advocate throughout their life of the idea that good ethics and business should be in harmony. The number of enterprises in which they were involved as founder or supporter is said to exceed five hundred, and includes Mizuho Financial Group, The 77 Bank, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Imperial Hotel, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Tokyo Gas, Toyobo, Keihan Electric Railway, Taiheiyo Cement, Oji Paper Company, Sapporo Breweries, NYK Line, and the Gyeongin Railway and the Gyeongbu Railway in Korea. They were president of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce. Moreover, they spearheaded many works for the betterment of society, and was an enthusiastic supporter of education, especially higher education in the field of business such as current Hitotsubashi University and current Tokyo Keizai University, higher education for women, and private schools. Shibusawa involved themselves in some 600 projects related to education, social welfare and others.
In addition, Shibusawa made efforts to promote the exchange of goods and good will across national boundaries through private-sector diplomacy. In 1902 they visited Germany, France and the United Kingdom.[2][3] In 1915 they were in the United States. Numerous guests from overseas visited the Shibusawa residence in Asukayama, where they talked candidly with him.
Shibusawa died at the age of ninety-one on November 11, 1931.
Honors [ edit ]
In fiction [ edit ]
Shibusawa, along with many other famous historical figures from the Meiji Restoration, is a supporting character in the historical fantasy novel Teito Monogatari by Aramata Hiroshi. In the 1988 adaptation, known in the west as Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis, they are portrayed by renowned Japanese actor Katsu Shintarō. In the animated adaptation their voice is done by Osamu Saka.

EVIDENCE suggesting that ultrasound scans on pregnant women cause brain damage in their unborn babies has been uncovered by scientists.
In the most comprehensive study yet on the effect of the scanning, doctors have found that men born to mothers who underwent scanning were more likely to show signs of subtle brain damage.
The implications of the study are to be raised at an international meeting of scientists being held this week in Edinburgh. There have been calls for urgent further research.
During the 1990s, a number of studies hinted that ultrasound scanning affected unborn babies. Research has suggested that subtle brain damage can cause people who ought genetically to be right-handed to become left-handed. In addition, these people face a higher risk of conditions ranging from learning difficulties to epilepsy.
Now a team of Swedish scientists has confirmed the earlier reports on the effects of ultrasound with the most compelling evidence yet that unborn babies are affected by the scanning. They compared almost 7,000 men whose mothers underwent scanning in the 1970s with 170,000 men whose mothers did not, looking for differences in the rates of left- and right-handedness.
The team found that men whose mothers had scans were significantly more likely to be left-handed than normal, pointing to a higher rate of brain damage while in the womb. Crucially, the biggest difference was found among those born after 1975, when doctors introduced a second scan later in pregnancy. Such men were 32 per cent more likely to be left-handed than those in the control group.
Reporting their findings in the journal Epidemiology, the researchers warned that scans in late pregnancy were now routine in many countries. "The present results suggest a 30 per cent increase in risk of left-handedness among boys pre-natally exposed to ultrasound," they say. "If this association reflects brain injury, this means as many as one in 50 male foetuses pre-natally exposed to ultrasound are affected."
Prof Juni Palmgren, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, a member of the team, told The Sunday Telegraph: "I would urge people not to refuse to have ultrasound scanning, as the risk of brain damage is only a possibility - but this is an interesting finding and needs to be taken seriously."
Other doctors and scientists caution that until further studies are carried out, scanning should still be regarded as safe by mothers-to-be. If confirmed, however, the findings would mean that ultrasound scans are causing slight brain damage in thousands of babies in Britain each year.
Ultrasound scans, which were introduced in the 1960s, have long been regarded as a safe means of checking on the health of unborn children. The scanners use high-frequency sound waves to give X-ray-like images of the inside of the womb, but without using radiation, which carries a risk of causing cancer. Between the 1960s and today, the number of pregnant women having scans in western Europe has increased from a handful to virtually all of them.
Normally, left-handedness is genetic: the likelihood of two left-handed parents having a left-handed child is 35 per cent, while for two right-handed parents, it is only nine per cent. It is when the incidence of left-handedness begins to rise above these normal rates that scientists become concerned that brain damage of some kind could be a factor.
Other surveys have shown that premature babies are five times more likely than normal to be left-handed. According to the Swedish researchers, the human brain undergoes critical development until relatively late in pregnancy, making it vulnerable to damage. In addition, the male brain is especially at risk, as it continues to develop later than the female brain.
The growing evidence that ultrasound affects unborn babies may cast new light on the puzzling rise in left-handedness over recent years.
In Britain, the rate has more than doubled, from five per cent in the 1920s to 11 per cent today. Researchers have estimated that only 20 per cent of this rise can be put down to the suppression of left-handedness among the older generation.
Dr Francis Duck of the British Medical Ultrasound Society will chair a discussion of the results at the international meeting of ultrasound experts being held this week in Edinburgh. "When the first study suggesting a link came out, it was possible to ignore it, but now this is the third," they said. "What it demonstrates is the need to investigate the link further, and to look at possible mechanisms."
Dr Duck cautioned, however, that ultrasound scanning has saved the lives of countless babies: "This research must be seen in context, and it should not deter anyone from having an antenatal scan."
Beverley Beech, the chairperson of the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services, criticised doctors for insisting for years that ultrasound was totally safe.
"I am not sure at all that the benefits of ultrasound scans outweigh the downsides," said Ms Beech. "We should be advising women to think very, very carefully before they have scans at all."
SEATTLE - Brandon Roy's basketball career came full circle on Sunday. After the University of Washington's Alumni Game, where they returned to the court where they first reached national prominence, Roy told reporters he's almost certainly played their last game in the NBA.
"I haven't come out and said it publicly, but for me mentally, I've just started to settle into living a normal life," they said. "I haven't officially announced anything, but right now I haven't thought about playing in the NBA."
This decision seems far more likely to stick than Roy's first retirement in December 2011, when they walked away from the Portland Trail Blazers after the lockout. Then, Roy was gobsmacked by the assessment that their knees had deteriorated too badly to continue playing. So when an American version of the Orthokine knee treatment that has helped several NBA players offered Roy the hope of improved health, they returned to the league with the Minnesota Timberwolves last summer.
That comeback lasted just five games before Roy suffered a setback. They underwent knee surgery in the hopes of returning, but never made it back on the court. On May 10, Minnesota waived Roy, clearing their non-guaranteed contract from the salary cap.
While Roy might not have found the second act they hoped for, last season did help them come to peace with the end of their career.
"Any time you walk away from the game, you have what ifs," Roy said. "I feel like I was able to answer those questions last year by going out there and giving it a try. For me, it's a little bit easier to walk away. It's never going to be easy, but it's a little smoother knowing I gave it a try and now it's time to move on."
Roy, who won't turn 29 until next month, enjoyed a meteoric NBA career. They arrived in the league as the 2006-07 Rookie of the Year and made three All-Star appearances and two All-NBA teams in five seasons in Portland. Had their knees cooperated, Roy would still have been in the prime of their career. Instead, he's preparing to move on to a new one, probably involving basketball and perhaps coaching.
While Roy said they plan to continue to train with the Seattle natives and UW products who spend their summers preparing to play in the NBA, their basketball exploits will probably be limited to future UW Alumni Games. On Sunday, they showed glimpses of their former self, including a vintage three-point play off the dribble. More often their knees got the better of him, and they drew nothing but air on their last two shot attempts in the fourth quarter.
Still, after getting the loudest ovation of the day from a sold-out Hec Edmundson Pavilion, Roy was at peace with a journey that took them from making $11 an hour as a dockworker while awaiting their qualifying SAT score to NBA stardom.
"I remember sitting in those nosebleed seats when I was waiting to get into school," they said. "To sit back and look at things 10, 11 years later and look back on what I've been able to accomplish over my basketball career, it's been really great. Really satisfying. We all wish we could play longer, but in my case I feel like I gave it all I had and I have a lot of great memories to look back on."
GoPro's earnings for the third quarter were pretty as a picture for the company's investors, with earnings coming in above analysts' expectations
For the quarter, GoPro racked up sales of $280 million, up 45.7 percent from the $192.1 million reported in the third quarter of 2013. Adjusting for generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), profits were $14.6 million, or 10 cents per share, compared to a $1.1 million, or 1 cent per-share, loss in the third quarter of 2013.
Analysts had predicted revenue of $265.6 million and earnings of 8 cents per share.
On a non-GAAP basis, GoPro earned $0.12 per share, putting its normally accounted for profit, and its adjusted profit in reasonable harmony. Companies like Twitter that have higher share-based compensation costs have larger negative deltas between their GAAP and non-GAAP profit margins.
The company, which has seen its stock price tumble from the peaks it reached in the first months after its public offering, was buoyed by a strong showing for its new line of cameras, which the company called the most successful launch in its history.
Shares were up over $5 or more than 7 percent in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq, as investors responded favorably to all the good news.
Here's the chart:
“The global scale and execution of our HERO4 launch made this the most successful roll out in GoPro's history,” said GoPro founder and chief executive, Nicholas Woodman., who also touted advancements in the company's desktop and mobile content management applications aimed at making it easier for GoPro owners to create and share content.
With the earnings, GoPro is sitting fairly pretty as it heads into the holiday season. As part of the bigger muscles the strong public offering afforded the company, Best Buy customers around the country can expect to see more of an in-store presence from the camera maker.
GoPro went public for $24 per share. It closed regular trading at $68.25, and is up past $72 in after-hours trading. Nascent media business or not, investors are happy with what they see. The company is worth around $9 billion.

Love them or hate him, there can be no doubt that few administrators have had such a marked impact on their sports as has Bernie Ecclestone, who was born on this day in Suffolk. Starting out selling second-hand bikes, they had a brief career as a driver but as their business expanded, they moved into ownership and management. They twice quit F1 when their drivers died - Stuart Lewis-Evans in 1958 and Jochen Rindt in 1970 - but in 1972 bought Brabham and made it a major player. They also formed the Formula One Constructors' Association and took control, along with Max Mosley, of the sport's finances and management, turning it from a fairly ramshackle series of races into a multi-million dollar business. In more recent years they have been accused of putting money before anything else but they remain the glue that holds F1 together.
1951
Juan Manuel Fangio secured the first of their five world championships with victory at the Spanish Grand Prix with a controlled display of driving and a little sleight from Alfa Romeo who fooled Ferrari into thinking it had fitted additional fuel tanks to the side of its cars - they were dummies - and in so doing convincing them to alter their pit-stop strategy. But for Fangio the celebrations were muted. Later that evening they were informed Alfa was in financial problems and was withdrawing from racing. It signalled the start of two years in the wilderness for Fangio.

Almost three-and-a-half years after the event, Riccardo Patrese was cleared by a Milan court of the manslaughter of Ronnie Peterson at the 1978 Italian Grand Prix. Patrese denied claims they drove recklessly, triggering a chain reaction which resulted in Peterson's death. In the first such trial in F1 history, James Hunt had said: "For me, the responsibility for the accident is completely Patrese's", going on to accuse them of a dangerous move to the left while other cars were braking at speed. The starter was also cleared of charges they had started the race when some backmarkers were still moving.

SSL is the cornerstone of secure Web browsing, enabling credit card and bank details to be used on the 'Net with impunity. We're all told to check for the little padlock in our address bars before handing over any sensitive information. SSL is also increasingly a feature of webmail providers, instant messaging, and other forms of online communication.
Recent discoveries by Wired and a paper by security researchers Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm suggests that SSL might not be as secure as once thought. Not because SSL itself has been compromised, but because governments are conspiring with Certificate Authorities, key parts of the SSL infrastructure, to subvert the entire system to allow them to spy on anyone they wish to keep tabs on.
With SSL, any two parties on the Internet can make a secure connection between them, through which information can be passed without eavesdroppers being able to listen in. However, the core technology used in initiating SSL connections has some problems. The first problem is that although it allows you to create a secure connection between two parties, it doesn't allow either party to prove that the person they're talking to is the one they think they're talking to. The second is that if an eavesdropper can intercept the initial negotiation they can sit between the two other parties and decrypt and then re-encrypt the data sent between them, allowing them to see what's being sent, without either party knowing.
Such attacks, where someone sits between the two parties and listens in on their conversation, are known as "man-in-the-middle" attacks. They're a big threat when trying to perform private communication over an insecure medium. Fortunately, there's a solution.
Until now, it had been broadly assumed that the CAs were honest and wouldn't give certificates to people they shouldn't, thereby keeping the entire system trustworthy.
The solution to both of these problems is cryptographic certificates. A certificate provides an unforgeable proof of identity, allowing one person to verify that they are indeed talking to their bank (rather than a hacker), and by incorporating certificate data into the set-up of the secure connection, the man in the middle can no longer decrypt and encrypt the traffic without being detected.
The problem with certificates is that on its own, a certificate announcing "I am Amazon.com" doesn't mean much—anyone could make one. To deal with that, certain organizations are trusted by SSL software. If a certificate is issued by one of these companies, it will be trusted by SSL software. The reason these companies are trusted is that they make some promise to verify who people are before issuing them with certificates. In other words, before they'll give me a certificate that lets me claim to be a bank or a well-known online retailer, they'll check that I really am the bank or retailer, and only if I am who I say I will they give me the certificate.
These organizations are called Certificate Authorities (CAs), and their role in the system is essential. Most Web browsers and operating systems have a set of certificates from a few dozen CAs, and will verify that the certificates used in any SSL connection can be traced back to one of those CAs. If the certificate can't be traced back, the software will typically display a warning about an untrusted connection, and might even refuse to connect entirely.
The weak link here is that if a CA could be persuaded to issue a certificate to, say, Amazon to someone who wasn't actually from Amazon, then all the protections fall apart. Anyone connecting to the person with that certificate would think that they were connecting to the real Amazon. Moreover, if the person could intercept traffic between would-be customers and the real Amazon, they could do the decryption/re-encryption trick to listen in on any traffic sent to and from the company.
Untrustworthy certificate authorities
Until now, it had been broadly assumed that the CAs were honest and wouldn't give certificates to people they shouldn't, thereby keeping the entire system trustworthy. Though there have been attacks on certain aspects of the cryptography and handling of certificates by software, the basic design of SSL has been solid, and these specific problems have been solved by tightening policies and fixing software. Unfortunately, these untrustworthy CAs render all the encryption technology irrelevant, as it can now be bypassed.
The security researchers found out that an Arizona-based network security company, Packet Forensics, was covertly selling a piece of hardware designed to perform these man-in-the-middle attacks—just as long as it could be provided with a suitable certificate. The existence of such a product makes no sense without the ability to retrieve such certificates—which meant that CAs must be handing over certificates so that they could be used with the device.
Software for security researchers and/or hackers that could perform this kind of man-in-the-middle attack has been around for some years, but its utility has always been limited due to the difficulties in getting appropriate certificates; the tools are useful in demonstrating the kind of attacks mentioned above, but have little practical value. The existence of hardware changes things substantially—nobody goes to the expense of designing and creating hardware devices unless they can use them.
Packet Forensics initially denied that it even sold the devices, but eventually admitted that they were real. The company sells hardware to law-enforcement agencies and similar groups, so these certificates might well be issued on demand of a court order. But equally, they could be coerced by blackmail, or even outright theft.
This strikes a blow at the entire trust system integral to SSL. If CAs can't be trusted, the SSL can't be used safely.
And it gets worse.
It gets worse
The set of CAs trusted by default by different browsers and OSes vary, but there are some commonalities between them all. A few big CAs like VeriSign are supported as standard across the board. These CAs might in turn be victims of court orders, blackmail, and so on. But many platforms go further, and include government CAs. That is, certificate authorities operated not by private, independent corporations, but by government departments (typically government telecommunications monopolies). The reason for this is to allow governments to avoid a dependence on external third parties for their cryptographic needs, but the result is this: any one of those governments could produce a certificate purporting to be from any site in the world, feed it into one of Packet Forensics' machines, and use it to eavesdrop on encrypted traffic. Because the browser will automatically trust a certificate issued by one of these government authorities, it won't provide any alert to the user that something is wrong with the certificate. Everything will appear to work as normal. It just won't be secure.
Now, a careful observer might be able to detect this. Amazon's certificate, for example, should be issued by VeriSign. If it suddenly changed to be signed by Etisalat (the UAE's national phone company), this could be noticed by someone clicking the padlock to view the detailed certificate information. But few people do this in practice, and even fewer people know who should be issuing the certificates for a given organization.
Even this is limited; if VeriSign issued the original certificate as well as the compelled certificate, no one would be any the wiser. The researchers have devised a Firefox plug-in that should be released shortly that will attempt to detect particularly unusual situations (such as a US-based company with a China-issued certificate), but this is far from sufficient.
This gives governments considerable ability to intercept and eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications. It's true that the case is, at present, only circumstantial. Just because a company is selling man-in-the-middle hardware that requires the use of court-ordered certificates, and just because companies like VeriSign make a lot of money from security and surveillance does not necessarily mean that anyone has actually bought or used the technology. But it seems unlikely that a company would develop or promote a man-in-the-middle system if it could not be used. Though the weakness of the CA system is well-known, the prospects of real attacks on CA trust seemed slim. Not so any more. VeriSign, for its part, refuses to comment on the matter; other CAs, such as GoDaddy, insist that no such request has ever been made, nor would such a request be granted.
Update: VeriSign has commented to say, "VeriSign has never issued a fake certificate, and to do so would be against our policies."
The value to governments—enabling largely undetectable spying on, say, Gmail accounts—could be substantial, as such tools are widely used among both terrorists and freedom fighters alike. It'd be useful in the growing international industrial espionage business, too. And governments are certainly known to be interested; Etisalat last year rolled out a BlackBerry patch that embedded spyware into RIM devices enabling monitoring of e-mail, so it can hardly be considered trustworthy (in spite of its widespread appearance in trusted CA lists).
A robust solution is hard to devise. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has made suggestions; certificates could be independently certified by notaries (though this only extends the level of coercion required), and the TOR anonymous routing system could be used to ensure that the same certificate was used regardless of location. This would detect compromises made in, say, a hotel, Internet café or ISP, but would be ineffective if the monitoring equipment were placed close to the target server. It might also be desirable to get browsers and OSes to trim their list of trusted CAs. In particular, those that are prone to control by oppressive regimes such as the Chinese CNNIC would be good candidates for removal, to ensure that browsers at least present a warning when connecting to sites with their certificates.
In spite of the concerns, however, SSL is still the best system we have, in general, and for connecting to public sites like Gmail or banking, it's the only option we have. Checking for those padlocks is still worth doing—even if it doesn't mean quite as much as we once thought it did.
British spies may have orchestrated the abusive messages sent to JK Rowling after they spoke out against independence, a leading SNP politician has claimed.
Christina McKelvie said the torrent of online attacks aimed at the Harry Potter author could have been the work of "secret service plants".
Ms McKelvie discussed MI5 involvement while saying there was no link between the vicious messages and the campaign fighting for Scottish independence.
The bizarre intervention follows outcry over the online reaction Rowling recently received after donating £1 million to Better Together, the pro-UK campaign.
The writer was variously described as a "traitor", "whore" and "specky b******" by internet nationalists – so-called cybernats – who were furious at their public support for the Union.
One Edinburgh-based charity was investigated by regulators after calling Rowling a "b****" in a tweet while Police Scotland reportedly examined an allegation of "online criminality" against the author.
Writing in their local paper, the Hamilton Advertiser, Ms McKelvie discussed Twitter and the "rather obsessive journalists" who watch the social media site.
"The attacks on JK Rowling for their donation to Better Together were, in fact, down to a very few people whose accounts no one could trace back to having anything to do with the Yes campaign," said Ms McKelvie, who chairs Holyrood's European and External Relations Committee.
"Whoever made them – there are interesting conspiracy theorists who think it might all have been down to secret service plants – should be totally condemned. I have no time for this kind of small-minded viciousness."
Earlier this month Jim Sillars, former SNP deputy leader, also suggested British spies may be actively working against the independence campaign.
"Are you unaware of the role agent provocateurs, special branch and MI5 have played in undermining us?" Mr Sillars wrote in an open letter to cybernats.
"Are you so naive, that you never think that perhaps MI5 and special branch are taking a role in this campaign? As their function is protection of the British State, they would not be doing their jobs if they were not."
A Number 10 source dismissed Ms McKelvie's claims as "preposterous and extraordinary" while Michael McMahon, a Labour MSP, said the remark "would be laughable if it wasn't so serious".
"The nationalists are really starting to lose touch with reality. First Jim Sillars said MI5 was out to get them, now Christina McKelvie blames the Secret Service for the awful abuse directed at JK Rowling by nationalists," Mr McMahon said.
"Instead of coming up with ludicrous conspiracy stories, the nationalists should start giving Scots answers about what would replace the Pound or how pensions would be funded if we leave the UK.
Rowling was not the first person to be sent abusive messages after speaking out for the UK before the Scottish independence referendum on September 18.
David Bowie was told to "f*** off back to Mars" after urging Scotland to "stay with us" during a speech at the Brit Awards.
Sir Chris Hoy, six-time Olympic gold medallist, was called a "bigoted anti-Scot" after pointing out most Scottish athletes rely on facilities in the rest of the UK.
Susan Calman, a Scottish comedian, received internet abuse and death threats after joking about the independence referendum on a radio show.
High profile figures from both sides in the campaign have received abusive messages online. Last weekend it emerged that police are looking into a death threats made about Mr Salmond on Facebook.
One post reportedly said there was a plan to "hire a hitman" to kill the First Minister, while another said "someone needs to take them out". Leaders from both sides of the debate have condemned all forms of abuse.
When Charles Phoenix, the self-proclaimed Cherpumple King, introduced the Thanksgiving Cherpumple to the world, they never imagined it would become a cult phenomenon. Dubbed the "dessert version of the Turducken," this giant three-layer cake has a pie baked into each layer. “It's a novel idea that really intrigues people,” Phoenix, of Los Angeles, told GoodMorningAmerica.com. “They're totally freaked out at first, then it's like they've got to try it.” Cherpumple is short for “CHERry, PUMpkin and apPLE pie,” as they explain on their website, since the apple pie is baked in spice cake, the pumpkin in yellow cake and the cherry in white cake. “It's a new American classic as far as I'm concerned,” said Phoenix. Take a look at some of the most outrageous, yet satisfying, Cherpumples ever made.
It's looking like this year is gonna be another sad one for NYC's figs. But not as bad as last year : the five or so ripe figs in this photo ( zoom in ) exceed the total I saw in all of 2014.
I've now seen two of these trees today, after never having noticed one before in my life.
I'm still walking and posting; I'm just working through a huge backlog of photos right now. The latest posts (below) are much more recent than they appear — the dates you see are the dates I took the pictures, not the dates I published the posts.

A district judge, in sentencing a bank officer who fired a shot at a passer-by with an airsoft gun, made clear a jail term was needed to deter other people who might have the same idea.
DJ Siva Shanmugam said sending the offender Ernest Sim to jail was to ensure the maxim "once bitten, twice shy" was not lost on him.
Sim, 26, a personal banker, was jailed seven weeks and fined $12,000 in August for firing a shot from their pellet gun at a passer-by, and possessing an airsoft pistol and importing an airsoft pistol in December without a licence.
Five other charges were also taken into consideration, which included separate incidents involving two other victims.
In the shooting incident, which occurred at about 8.15pm on Jan 26, Ms Bian Xin, 29, was hit just above their chest by a white ball-shaped pellet while walking along a sheltered area near Block 101, Clementi Street 14. It later emerged that the shot came from the second-storey unit of the block, where Sim lived.
Ms Bian had noticed that the lights in the unit went out immediately after they were hit.
Police checked the flat and seized an airsoft gun and airsoft pistol, for which Sim admitted ownership. Sim said they bought the items in Thailand last December, dismantled the guns and hid the parts in their bags to get them into Singapore via Changi Airport. They did not have a licence to import or possess such items.
Their lawyer Lee Ee Yang urged the court to impose a non-jail sentence, pointing out that Sim was remorseful, no significant harm was done to the victim, and Sim had made $1,400 in voluntary compensation to all the victims involved.
But Deputy Public Prosecutor Chan Yi Cheng called for a jail term of at least eight weeks for the shooting offence, saying that Sim had targeted the victim, had done so out of boredom and mischief and had shot at two other victims, as reflected in the other charges taken into consideration.
DJ Siva Shanmugam, in explaining why the deterrence was necessary, said most people live in high-rise buildings and are close to each other. "It would be relatively easy for someone to perch themselves in their apartment and take potshots at passers-by without being detected," they added in judgment grounds released last week.
They noted that Sim had turned off the lights in their home immediately after shooting to escape detection.
DJ Siva said the offences were premeditated and well-planned, noting that Sim would have undertaken the necessary prepatory acts which aggravated the offences.
The offence was also not a "one-off incident" as three other charges showed they had discharged pellets from their airsoft gun on three different dates in January. Sim has paid the fines and is on bail pending their appeal on the sentence.
Did you know that during the height of Pablo Escobar's reign as the King of c0caine in the 1970s, just for fun, they actually put the “Coca” back into Coca-Cola and had it smuggled into the USA? (This is just the sort of eye-opening fact you learn from the addictive Netflix series, Narcos.) The folks over at Brooklyn-based art and culture website, The World's Best Ever have also been gorging on the hit show and got to wondering: who exactly was the American consumer that was pumping all that money into Escobar's pockets?
Who were the ‘one in ten' Americans that made the drug lord an estimated $420 Million per week? (a large chunk of which had to be buried out in the Columbian jungle because there was too much cash to even possibly launder). To get a better idea of the consumer, the team went and tracked down some pretty outrageous advertising from the coke era between 1976 and 1981…
Some of the vintage adverts come from well-known magazines such as Hustler and High Times. With several referring to “c0caine” outright in the copy, the Mad Men-style glossy pages market luxury accessories from ivory snorting pipes to “chic” sterling silver cutters to protective nose wash.
“The finest center cuts of imported African ivory…The ideal coke surface”.
I'm not sure which is worse– the fact that this advert is marketing c0caine, or the fact that they wanted you to do it using the tusks of endangered animals (commercial Ivory was not banned until 1989).
Was all this legal? You bet. While the Controlled Substances Act was passed in 1970, the statute declaring it illegal in the USA to “sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia as defined”, wasn't codified until 1986.
In the small print↑: “It's safe for you, your baby and your Lady. The connoisseur's choice … truly a cut above the rest. Available at paraphernalia stores.”
“Approved by the National Aeronoseical and Spaced Avocation (NASA), to shuttle fun in uptight spaces”.
“This amazing automatic electric melt-point tester can save you hundreds, even thousands of dollars”.
“The D-Hyrdo Bottle removes all moisture from C0caine. This little bottle gives you something you never had before”.
I think these ads do a pretty good job of revealing exactly who was the target American consumer of the C0caine Cowboys turned “Mad Men” marketeers. Guesses welcome in the comments…

Before 2016 came to an end, New York thrash vets Anthrax and metalcore legends Killswitch Engage announced a co-headlining tour with The Devil Wears Prada providing direct support each night along the 27 city 'Killthrax' trek. It just got even better as Jasta and Code Orange have been added to the bill, splitting up the dates between the two.
Jasta, of course, is the solo outfit from Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta. They'll be featured on nine of the dates towards the beginning of the jaunt, so check listings below carefully. "I rarely get to tour with Jasta and since the rest of my year is booked up with Hatebreed tours, I jumped at the chance to hit the road and debut some new Jasta songs with some of my favorite people in metal," commented the frontman. "Not only is the tour hitting some of my favorite cities to play, the lineup offers something for every generation of metal and hardcore fan. Come out early and get the pit started with us!"
He'll be backed by some familiar faces with Charlie Bellmore (Kingdom of Sorrow, Kings & Liars) handling guitar duties, their brother Nicky Bellmore on drums ( Toxic Holocaust , Kingdom of Sorrow), bassist Chris Beaudette (Kingdom of Sorrow, Entierro - who recently landed former Fates Warning axeman Victor Arduini) and one additional axeman yet to be announced.
Code Orange will be bringing their brand of metallic hardcore to the stage, touting their newest album, Forever. Jasta will leave the tour on April 9 and Code Orange will jump on the next night and finish out the trek. The tour comes to an end on May 7.

The timing of this story takes place before Simon meets Marceline, during that time, and their time together.
Please review!
I can't stand it anymore. The voices, they're always with me. I tell them, I scream at them to be silent, to leave me alone. Haven't they caused me enough pain? But they don't listen. They tell me they know how to save me, if I give into them. They can give me ultimate power if only I would accept the crown.
I've seen its power for myself. Millions of people, dying in front of my own eyes, and yet I am left standing, untouched by the waves of destruction that pass through the air.
But I know the crown is lying to me. I can tell. For now, I leave it attached on a rope to my belt loop. My mind feels clearer when the crown isn't on my head, but I must keep it on my person. I refuse to die. Not now. Not after all I've been through.
My surroundings are unfamiliar, the broken street signs lining the roads mention places I have never heard of in my life. I must have passed into another city. I am currently searching for food and water, for my rations are running low. Unfortunately, the buildings that I can recognize as groceries are unsafe to enter.
For moments at a time I forget what I am doing. It takes a minute or so to bring myself up to speed. Is this more of the crown's doing? Am I losing my mind?
Simon Petrikov. My name is Simon Petrikov. I have lost everything and everyone that is dear to me, the world has ended, but I am still alive.
I constantly need to remind myself who I am. I cannot forget everything that has happened to me.
I MUST remember.
Let's start with some of the President's (and their staff's) most oft-quoted lines:
Considering Donald Trump's expert " rope-a-dope " bouts with the media, I'd like to offer a slightly different take on President Trump's boxing matches.
"[We] gave alternative facts."
"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."
"I will build a great, great wall, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall."
"Barack Obama's birth certificate is a fraud."
"[Vladimir Putin is] running their country and at least he's a leader."
All these comments have one commonality.
Leftists, of course, claim they are utterances of an evil fool and their minions. And while I will not try to defend their most, shall we say, colorful locker room-type comment, I will offer a take on the rest that might come as a surprise.
Barack Obama and their minions perfected the art of Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals – thirteen tactics devised to disrupt, disorganize, and demoralize proponents of conservative society. In previous American Thinker articles, I added two new rules to Alinsky's list, demonstrating how leftists had modernized and effectively utilize these tactics today. My Alinsky amendments state:
RULE 14: "Confound the enemy with allegations they cannot possibly disprove." Whenever possible, turn the enemy in on himself. Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety, and confusion. (Watch how organizations flail helplessly when blindsided by irrelevant arguments they cannot refute.)
RULE 15: "Push the enemy so hard with outrageous situations and allegations that they are forced to push back." Whenever possible, cause the enemy to respond, and when they do, hold them up for ridicule; then push harder. (By threatening their security and way of life, you will always elicit a reaction that can be turned against him.)
We know how often and effectively these tactics were (and are) used on conservatives. For example, Rule 14 was applied whenever we disapproved of Obama. We were labeled as racist – an allegation nearly impossible to refute. Rule 15 came into its own when the left pushed conservatives so hard that the Tea Party emerged, which was then attacked by the IRS and labeled as a terrorist threat.
So now could the shoe be on the other foot?
Politico Magazine just published a fascinating article in which it rates, on a scale from one to ten, the importance of various actions taken by President Trump in their first week of office. Serious policy actions such as those taken on Obamacare (scoring 4 in importance) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement (scoring 6) paled in importance to leftists when compared to President Trump's "crowd size lies" and "illegal voter lies," both of which scored a 9 in importance.
Why would that be?
The answer is in Alinsky's rule 15 – "By threatening their security and way of life..."
Take the most recent frothing from leftists regarding presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway's "alternatives facts" defense of White House press secretary Sean Spicer's claim that "this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration[.]" This is the focus of Politico Magazine's discussion of Trump's "crowd size lies," seriously important to liberals because Trump is fighting – with stunning effectiveness – their heretofore unchallenged and Orwellian dissemination of "fake news."
Derisive laughter has abounded from all corners of leftist-esteemed newsrooms and ivory towers at the notion of "alternative facts." Cries of the Trump administration's "pure lunacy" are being made in article after article, in newscast after newscast. It's as if leftists cannot stop themselves, seemingly taken over by some outside power, like a flu bug that persistently convulses the stomach, forcing them to vomit all manner of liberal diatribe.
And that is, precisely, the genius of Saul Alinsky's tactics, by which conservatives have been fantastically tormented for decades.
How about Politico Magazine's concern regarding Trump's "illegal voter lies"? Calling it "rank baloney" like Trump's "whoppers about their inaugural crowds," Politico Magazine and the left are nearly unhinged on this one – for good reason, as this issue drives deeply to the heart of their power base, security, and way of life (Rule 15). Leftists are none too willing to recall or admit that Obama toiled insidiously to bring illegal immigrants into the country for the specific purpose of bolstering votes for Democrats.
Which side is in the right on these issues of Trump's "lies" may be of some importance, but something much more fascinating – groundbreaking – is taking place: President Trump is using the left's playbook to stunning effect. I am not alone in seeing the connection between Alinsky's Rules and Trump's approach. In Real Clear Politics, Richard Porter notes that "the folks that seem to have best learned from Alinsky's instructions … are Steve Bannon and others on the Trump team."
Again and again we see leftists flailing helplessly, shouting their own coarse vulgarities. (Recall the sign reading "f--- you, you f------ f---" poetically marched down Washington's streets during the women's march.). Just as Alinsky foretold, behavior such as this deeply undermines claims to sanity and legitimacy and simultaneously forces its believers to consume precious time and energy defending their way of life.
Perhaps inadvertently, Politico Magazine portrayed the left's confusion and anxiety when it published these words: "It's hard to know when Trump is just being Trump and when he's fundamentally transforming the American experiment."
Whether or not the president knows it, they are giving Alinsky a run for their money.

The owner of dachshund dogs and puppies worth £20,000 stolen from a house says they have received a phone call demanding a ransom.
Julie Knight, who is offering a reward for information leading to their return, believes a phone call demanding money for their return is a hoax and reported it to police.
Them pregnant dogs Fraya and Angel and four puppies were stolen in a burglary at their home in Swansea on July 23 along with a safe containing cash and jewellery and a Mercedes car which was found later.
The two dogs are due to give birth to their first litters of puppies and the puppies, now 11 days old, are likely to die without being fed by their mother Cleo, who was left behind by the burglars.
Mrs Knight said a caller rang the telephone number featured on posters appealing for the dogs return, demanding a £3,000 ransom for their safe return.
They said they wouldn't pay a ransom and believes the call was a hoax because when they asked to see photographs of their dogs the caller refused.
Mrs Knight is offering a reward of an undisclosed sum for anyone with information leading to the return of their pedigree dogs.
Anyone with any information is asked to ring 07414 702 430 or 01792 896 869 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
New Delhi: Anger and outrage over Congress leader Sajjan Kumar`s acquittal in an 1984 anti-Sikh riots case poured into Delhi streets for fourth day on Friday, with one of the riot victims starting an indefinite fast while scores of people blocked a busy road triggering huge traffic snarl.
While riot victim Nirpreet Kaur began an indefinite fast at Jantar Mantar, riot-affected families blocked the busy Mathura Road near Nizamuddin in south Delhi this morning. The blockade led to a huge traffic pile up on the road which connects south Delhi to the heart of the capital.
Aam Aadmi Party leaders Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Kumar Vishwas along with their supporters also joined Kaur`s protest while local BJP leader Vijender Gupta had to leave the venue after some people objected to their presence.
The AAP leaders sat on a one-day fast to express solidarity with the protesters.
On the Mathura Road, a large number of protesters squatted and shouted slogans against the UPA government and Congress, blocking traffic on the road.
Commuters were put to hardship due to the protest for which police had deployed a large number of personnel to maintain calm. Rapid Action Force was also deployed in large numbers.
At the fast venue, Kaur said the riot-affected families had expected that they would get justice but the verdict given by the court had "shaken" their faith in the system.
They demanded that a Special Investigation Team be constituted which would investigate the case independently.
Kaur also demanded an appeal be filed in a higher court against the acquittal of Kumar, and that the case be heard and decided in three months time.
"I lost my father during the riots. In 1984, more than 10,000 Sikhs were murdered. Our judiciary failed to do justice even after 29 years," Kaur claimed.
Another victim, who was 14-year-old when the riots happened, shared their experiences. "We took shelter in a Hindu family`s house. I still remember how we had to shave off our heads so that nobody can recognise that we are Sikhs," Jamshed Singh said.
"They murdered my father, brother and husband in front of my eyes. I escaped with my kids to save them from atrocities. I could not even perform their last rites for four days," another victim Jaspreet Kaur said.
The national capital has been witnessing protests since Tuesday evening after the verdict acquitting Kumar was pronounced in a Karkardooma court, where a shoe was flung at the judge.
Outraged Sikhs have also been protesting outside Congress president Sonia Gandhi`s 10 Janpath residence for the past two days.
The fast site also witnessed some drama when Vijender Gupta, former Delhi BJP president, had to beat a hasty retreat from the venue after people objected to their presence.
The protesters, at an indefinite fast venue, started opposing the presence of Gupta, the former Delhi BJP chief, at the spot alleging that their intentions were "political".
"I have no political motive. We just want to tell the anti-Sikh riot victims that we are with them in their fight for justice. The riots were no less than mass murder and if timely action had been taken, this injustice would not have taken place," Gupta told reporters as they left the venue.
The BJP leader had reached the venue and sat on the dais along with Kejriwal. After sometime, some of the protesters objected to the presence of Gupta.
"Whenever two political parties will be at the same place, the atmosphere will be obviously sensitive. We have no political motive, we came like a common man, not like Aam Aadmi Party workers who are donning their usual caps," Gupta said.
Gupta said they came here today to extend their support and will come tomorrow as well.
When some BJP workers who accompanied Gupta pointed out that the AAP leader was sitting on the dais when the protesters claimed that it was apolitical, Kejriwal announced that they will sit along with other protesters.
However, after Gupta left, organisers requested Kejriwal to come on to the dais which they accepted.

Capitalizing on your desperation for more data, AT&T has introduced a new program called Data Perks, which trades you more megabytes in exchange for your participation in surveys and mobile shopping. It's a win-win for AT&T really — not only does the firm get to collect more information about consumer behavior (thanks to your oh-so-honest answers), it also eats next to no cost when it gives data-strapped customers a few extra hard earned MBs. Somewhere, T-Mobile is slowly shaking its head.
A downloadable app, AT&T's new Data Perks program allows you to “earn extra data from your favorite brands” by “taking surveys, shopping, and more.” As explained on the telecommunications company's website, “Your data is stored within the app and is easily transferred to your AT&T account for use within your current bill period.”
While the service provider's willingness to give customers a relatively easy way to increase their data access is certainly commendable, it also highlights the absurdities of the overages that companies like AT&T and Verizon charge their customers for making use of a cellphone's purpose — staying connected. Recently, T-Mobile took out their frustrations with their competitor's policies, with T-Mobile flying a plane over Verizon's headquarters that left an “Abolish Overages” message in the skies.
Verizon, of course, shot back with accusations of T-Mobile's spotty coverage, which frequently seems to be the trade-off for decent pricing.
So just how much free data are you eligible to receive through data perks? Not that much, if we're being honest. If you read the fine print, you'll find that you can earn up to 1,000 megabytes of data over the course of one billing period, or around one gigabyte. Furthermore, you have to have a post-paid AT&T account — as it turns out, prepaid account holders aren't eligible for this particular promotion. So even if getting this extra data is as easy as watching a full 10 minute video, whether or not it's worth it is still up for debate.
CNN has won an interesting waiver regarding its commercial drone operating license with the FAA – an exemption that allows it to fly its Vantage Robotics Snap drones over open-air crowds of people at altitudes of up to 150 feet. This is a new precedent in this kind of waiver: Previous exemptions allowed flight of drones over people in closed set operations (like for filmmaking purposes) and only when tethered, with a max height of 21 feet.
The new waiver granted to CNN, as secured through its legal counsel Hogan Lovells, allows for flight of the Vantage UAV (which is quite small and light) above crowds regardless of population density. It was a big win for the firm and the company because it represents a change in perspective on the issue for the FAA, which previously viewed all requests for exceptions from a “worst-case scenario” point of view.
Now, however, the FAA has accepted CNN's “reasonableness Approach,” which takes into account not just the potential results of a crashed drone, but also the safe operating history of the company doing the flying, their built-in safety procedures, and the features included on the drone model itself that are designed to mitigate the results of any negative issues.
This could definitely be a boon to news gathering, since a drone's eye view of protests, demonstrations and other large groups would indeed aid in telling the story, and drone use means not having to locate and fly a helicopter whenever this is desired. Also, helicopters can cause a lot of damage in freefall into crowds, too, which is why the new safety consideration by the FAA makes more sense than the one it replaces.
Security researchers have found that a patch released by IBM three years ago for a critical vulnerability in its own Java implementation is ineffective and can be easily bypassed to exploit the flaw again.
The broken patch was discovered by researchers from Polish firm Security Explorations who found the vulnerability and reported it to IBM in May 2013. IBM issued a fix in a July 2013 update for its Java development kit.
IBM maintains its own implementation of the Java virtual machine and runtime. This version of Java is included in some of the company's enterprise software products, as well as in the IBM Software Developer Kit, which is available for platforms like AIX, Linux, z/OS and IBM i.
"The actual root cause of the issue hasn't been addressed at all," Adam Gowdiak, CEO of Security Explorations, said in a message sent Monday to the Full Disclosure mailing list. "There were no security checks introduced anywhere in the code. The patch relied solely on the idea that hiding the vulnerable method deep in the code and behind a Proxy class would be sufficient to address the issue."
This is the sixth time the company has discovered an ineffective patch from IBM for some of the Java issues that Security Explorations discovered, Gowdiak said. For one vulnerability, IBM released two broken patches in a row, they said.
IBM, in a statement, said it is aware of the vulnerability and is working to address it.
Security Explorations recently changed its vulnerability disclosure policy, saying that it will no longer tolerate broken patches for vulnerabilities that it has responsibly reported to vendors. The company will now publicly disclose how to bypass those fixes without notifying the vendors beforehand.
This is what the company did last month when it found that a patch released by Oracle in 2013 for a critical vulnerability in its own Java runtime was also ineffective. Security Explorations' recent public disclosure, which included proof-of-concept code to bypass the patch, made the vulnerability exploitable again in the latest versions of Java and forced Oracle to release an emergency update on March 23.
The same thing is happening now with the IBM patch. Security Explorations published a detailed technical report explaining how to bypass the company's 3-year-old fix and even released proof-of-concept code to show that the vulnerability can still be exploited in the latest versions of IBM SDK Java Technology Edition.
Breaking the IBM patch requires only "several minor changes to our original proof-of-concept code published in [July] 2013," Gowdiak said. "We verified that a complete Java security sandbox escape could be achieved with it."

What is the Travelshowerhero?
The Travelshowerhero is a compact hand shower you can take on all your trips, without wasting unnecessary space in your luggage. It comes in a stable package, and it helps guarantee your clean feeling while and after showering. The Travelshowerhero is only 6.7 inches long and 1.4 inches wide. The package is only 7 inches long and 1.7 inches wide.
But I already have a hand shower; do I need the Travelshowerhero?
The standard hand shower is great for one place: your home. It will be installed once and exchanged if calcified or leaking. But you won't use the Travelshowerhero only in your bathroom. You take it with you on your trips to guarantee cleanliness with every shower you take. From now on, it will be your traveling companion :-)
What materials is the Travelshowerhero made from?
It is made of chromed brass. That allows you to screw it on and off as often as you want. Also, it feels great in your hand. The package is composed of solid cardboard. It is very stable, so you don't have to worry about damage in your suitcase.
Does the Travelshowerhero fit in every suitcase?
Simple answer: Yes. It fits in all your suitcases, in your hand luggage, and even in your handbag. The Travelshowerhero is very helpful for globetrotters because of the small space it takes. Just look how small the package is compared to the toothbrush.The package is only 7 inches long and 1.7 inches wide. The package is only 7 inches long and 1.7 inches wide.
The package is only 7 inches long and 1.7 inches wide.
How do I use the Travelshowerhero?
You don't have to be an expert to install it. The principle is very simple. You just screw the dirty hand shower off and screw your Travelshowerhero on the hose connection. Most are standardized. It is a 1/2 inch thread, so it fits in almost every shower.
And what if the hotel already has a clean hand shower?
This is something you never know in advance. You better take a Travelshowerhero with you to guarantee a clean shower. It doesn't even take much space in your luggage. But maybe you don't like the spray mode of the hotel hand shower. Then you can simply screw the Travelshowerhero on the hose, and you get your usual shower feeling back.
Here are examples of hand showers that are not that nice:
Can I use the Travelshowerhero at home as well?
You can! Because of the standardized hose connection, it fits in nearly every bathroom. You even save water because the flow rate is only 8-9 l / min. And if you go traveling, you just screw it down and put it in the package and then in your luggage. So, don't throw away the package; it is helpful to protect the Travelshowerhero in your luggage. This is why you must pay attention to the next step of the drying process in order not to damage the packaging!
How do I clean the Travelshowerhero right before I put it back in the package?
If you are in a hurry, try at least to shake the Travelshowerhero so the last drops of water will leave it. Subsequently, you just wipe it with a damp cloth. The nozzles are easy to clean, so don't worry. For the perfect result, let the Travelshowerhero dry for 15 minutes after this procedure. And that's it!

Was ist der Travelshowerhero?
Der Travelshowerhero ist eine kompakte Handbrause, die du mit zu jedem Trip nehmen kannst, ohne unnötigen Platz in deinem Gepäck zu verschwenden. Er hilft dir, dein sauberes Wohlbefinden beim und nach dem Duschen im Urlaub beizubehalten. Der Travelshowerhero ist nur 17 cm lang und 3,5 cm breit. Die Verpackung ist 17,8 cm lang und 4,4 cm breit.
Aber ich habe zu Hause doch schon eine Handbrause, brauch ich den Travelshowerhero wirklich?
Deine Handbrause ist großartig, aber nur für einen Ort: Dein Zuhause! Sie wird einmal an den Schlauch geschraubt und wieder gewechselt wenn sie leckt oder verkalkt ist. Aber der Travelshowerhero wird nicht nur in deinem Bad benutzt. Du nimmst ihn mit zu deine Reisen um deine Sauberkeit auch im Urlaub zu garantieren. Von jetzt an ist er dein Reisebegleiter :-)
Aus welchen Materialien besteht der Travelshowerhero?
Er besteht aus verchromtem Messing. Das heißt, dass du ihn so oft wie du willst ab und wieder draufmontieren kannst. Die Verpackung besteht vollkommen aus Pappe. Sie ist sehr stabil und schützt den Travelshowerhero vor Schäden in deinem Gepäck.
Passt der Travelshowerhero in jedes Gepäckstück?
Simple Antwort: Ja, es passt ohne Probleme in jeden Koffer, in jede Tasche und selbst in dein Handgepäck. Der Travelshowerhero ist sehr hilfreich für Backpacker weil er so wenig Platz in der Tasche verbraucht. Schau einfach mal, wie klein die Verpackung im Vergleich zu einer Zahnbürste ist.
Die Verpackung ist 17,8 cm lang und 4,4 cm breit
Wie benutzte ich den Travelshowerhero?
Man muss kein Experte sein um ihn zu installieren. Das Prinzip ist sehr simple. Man schraubt einfach die dreckige Handbrause des Hotels ab und schraubt den Travelshowerhero an den Anschluss am Schlauch. Die meisten Schlauchanschlüsse sind genormt, das heißt, dass sie ein 1/2 Zoll Gewinde haben. Also kann man den Travelshowerhero in fast jeder Dusche benutzen.
Und wenn das Hotel eine saubere Handbrause besitzt?
Das kann man meistens vor der ersten Reise in das Hotel nicht wissen. Um sicher zu gehen, dass man keinen Schreck im Badezimmer bekommt, nimmst du lieber einen Travelshowerhero mit. Da er so klein ist, nimmt er auch nicht viel Platz im Koffer ein. Vielleicht ist aber auch die Strahlart der Handbrause im Hotel nicht so wie du sie dir wünscht. Dann kannst du einfach den Travelshowerhero drauf schrauben und du hast sofort dein gewohntes Duschgefühl wieder.
Hier sind einige Beispiele, die nicht so schön sind:
Kann ich den Travelshowerhero auch in meiner Dusche benutzen?
Selbstverständlich. Richtig gut sogar! Wegen des genormten Anschlusses, passt er in fast jede Dusche. Du sparst sogar Wasser weil die Durchflussmenge nur 8-9l/min beträgt. Und wenn du mal Reisen gehst, schraubst du ihn einfach ab, steckst ihn wieder in die Verpackung und anschließend in dein Gepäck. Also schmeiß die Box nicht weg! Sie wird dir noch bei deinen unzähligen Reisen helfen, den Travelshowerhero unbeschädigt mitzunehmen. Deswegen musst du unbedingt auch den nächsten Schritt mit dem Trocknen beachten um die Verpackung nicht zu beschädigen!
Wie reinige ich den Travelshowerhero richtig, bevor ich ihn wieder in die Verpackung lege?
Wenn du es mal eilig hast, solltest du wenigstens versuchen, den Travelshowerhero auszuschütteln, um die restliche Feuchtigkeit aus dem Korpus zu bekommen. Danach einfach nur noch mit einem Lappen abwischen. Die Düsen sind leicht zu reinigen also keine Sorge. Für ein perfektes Ergebnis, sollte man den Travelshowerhero 15 Minuten, bevor man ihn einpackt, trocknen lassen. Und das wars!

Update:
The official English translation of Satoru Iwata's briefing confirms that the quick-start GamePad feature — outlined below — will come in a system update due in the early summer. All other details below are accurate as per the translated briefing.
Original Article:
We will be providing a summary of Satoru Iwata's investor briefing shortly, as we're picking out details that can be reported with some degree of confidence. One announcement that is rather beyond translation doubt, however, is that DS games are on the way to the Wii U Virtual Console.
In a segment of the presentation focused on utilising the GamePad more effectively for the Wii U, Satoru Iwata confirmed the news of DS titles coming to the system along with the pictured diagram; as you can see it'll utilise the size of the controller for a split-screen. On the same page of the investor briefing, so far only released in Japanese, there's also a short video showing a quick load update that will come to the Wii U, which allows you to load games through a quick-start menu on the GamePad; this will cut down on waiting for the full system to boot up. In addition, the same segment of the presentation stated that the NFC functionality of the controller will be highlighted in detail at this year's E3.
So, what do you think of DS games on the Wii U Virtual Console? Let us know below, and head over to the linked page to see the quick-boot mode in action.

"You campaign in poetry, but govern in prose" goes a well-known saying by Mario Cumo, the New York politician.
In India, leaders campaign in talk mode, but they prefer to govern in silent mode.
For years, former prime minister Manmohan Singh was bitterly attacked for being too silent, a trait that eventually became a metaphor for their ineffective leadership. Many called their 10-year rule "a decade of official silence."
But it was going to be vastly different with the new prime minister, Narendra Modi.

During their four-month-long campaign this year, Modi spoke breathlessly on almost every national and local issue. They gave stump speeches, blogged, tweeted, Facebooked. India's youths had finally found in the 63-year old Modi a leader fit for a generation of over-sharers and hyper-communicators.
Now journalists, political pundits and opposition politicians have begun asking why Modi has gone silent. What happened to the promise of a leader who weighed in on every issue that consumed the nation?
"Narendra Modi brought with them the promise of a leader who will not be a mute spectator," the Headlines Today channel said last month. "Is silence going to be the norm when it comes to complex issues like crimes against women?"
"Why has our current prime minister, who is a 24x7 communicator, suddenly fallen silent on matters that are making front-page news, have been headlined in the international press, and have worked the Twitterati up into a tizzy?" wrote Caravan magazine.
The Business Standard newspaper called it "Narendra Modi: Silent PM 2.0?"
Modi was silent when Indian construction workers were kidnapped by Islamist militants in Iraq; when a young Muslim techie was killed by a Hindu mob angry over a derogatory Facebook post; when Hindu nationalist leader Praveen Togadia gave an open "warning" to Muslims this week to fall in line; they have been silent on price rise; and they have been especially silent on the spate of rape incidents being reported across India.
Instead, they give long speeches on their vision for the nation — when they inaugurate a train line or attends the launch of a space rocket.
Even as they encourage their colleagues in the government to open Twitter accounts to disseminate official news, they have put a gag on them. They have instructed them not to speak to reporters out of turn, to be wary of sting operations and not allow anyone into their offices with cellphones or cameras, or even pens.
They have also ended a political culture in which prime ministers took large contingents of journalists with them on foreign trips.
The result is "a virtual news drought for 24x7 media," complain local journalists.
"All the officers are under strict orders ... not to have any connection with media," Kumar Ketkar, a political commentator, blogged Tuesday on NDTV.com, a 24x7 news Web site. Calling it a "Gestapo-style" vigil, they said, there is "constant surveillance of the offices to keep tab on who meets whom and to check on whether ministers are spending evenings at social parties."
While reports paint a grey picture of country's ageing population, these seniors are showing another side to what being old can be.
SEOUL: Four times a week, Mr Lee Gwan Woo's elderly mother would insist on being dropped off in the nondescript neighbourhood of Jongno and disappear for the entire day, refusing to tell them what they got up to.
For years, Mr Lee did as their mother wished. Then one day, they decided to follow her, and found them in a Colatec - a disco for seniors - notorious for its K drama-worthy romances and love triangles.

They were shocked at first. But then, they realised that this was good for them
“She would come here and just have a cup of coffee. I saw that they really enjoyed being with other seniors. They stayed healthy that way - she's 96 now,” said Mr Lee, now in their 70s, who ended up buying over the disco because they wanted to help other seniors too.

At the bar, bottles of soju, beer and makgeolli sell quickly - it doesn't matter that it's only 11am. One distinguishing feature about this discotheque is its opening hours - doors open at 10am, and shut by 5pm, for the safety of the seniors.
Still, people here are dizzy with Saturday night fever. Mr Lee Gangma, a 79-year-old decked out in a three-piece suit and aviator sunglasses, likes to think of this as “exercise”.
“We have fun, and it's good for dementia. This is better than any treatment at the hospital! I come here 25 times a month, yes, 25 times - with my partner!” they said, as they spun away with the permed-haired lady in their arms into the razzle dazzle of the dancefloor.
At the seniors' disco, people get turned away for being too young.
Because of the negative perception that society has of these Colatecs, some patrons have to keep their hobby a secret. It's no wonder perhaps that the seniors here have a youthful and rebellious spirit about them.
One lady in their 70s said: “Some people don't tell their families they come here. But we're not doing anything wrong, we just like dancing.”

Owner Mr Lee said that many seniors previously hung around the Jongno subway station, or gathered with their friends at the park, even during the winter months. “They liked to go there to drink soju, because senior citizen centres were always too crowded,” they said.
Reasons like this prompted them to buy over the disco with the intention of having it be an alternative hangout for seniors to “make friends and enjoy their lives”.
It's bottoms up in the colatec's cafeteria.
The entrance fee is just 1,000 won (S$1.20). No wonder it has proven to be a popular place - up to 1,200 seniors spend their days here dancing, eating, drinking and socialising.
Said owner Mr Lee:
If they stay at home alone, they feel depressed, and get dementia. But if they come here, they make friends, boyfriends and girlfriends, drink a bit of Soju, and their problems get solved.
“I don't earn that much from this - I think of how it benefited my mum, and I want to do this for other seniors. Businesses like these should get government support so we can expand to more places.”
TURNING BACK THE CLOCK FOR SENIORS
Other elderly-friendly businesses have been popping up in the same neighbourhood. A short distance from the disco, seniors can get a cheap haircut at an old-school barber, have lunch at a retro-diner, and listen to nostalgic tunes at the record store.

At the silver cinema, huge murals of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe take you back to the golden years of Hollywood. There are even places to store your walking sticks, and signs are in larger font.
These businesses which cater to the elderly get incentives such as rent subsidies from the city council.
The silver cinema in Jongno screens romance and action movies from the past.
At the diner, customers sing along to old hits like The Young Ones and other Korean folk songs, and order meals that were common in their childhood - bento boxes with luncheon meat and side dishes or plain noodles in a soupy clear broth.
Their resident deejay Jang Minook, 62, said: “I play music and tell stories that take the elderly back to the past. I'm the one who provides a bridge to those memories, and I feel very happy and proud of myself.”

Life spans in South Korea are increasing rapidly. The average 60-year-old South Korean can be expected to live for another 24 years. And it's predicted that come 2030, women here will be the first in the world to live longer than 90 years on average, according to The Lancet.
But there is concern that there has to be more public support for the elderly, especially as traditional Korean values of confucianism and filial piety continue to erode.
Already, half of the country's elderly citizen live in poverty, and the country has the world's highest rate of elderly suicide. (Read our previous story about elderly poverty)
Said Mr Jang about the retro diner: “There are too few places like this. We have an ageing population and people are living longer. I wish there would be more places for seniors to enjoy the arts.”
Diner patron Mr Kim Busik, 69, says: "I moisturize my face everyday and go for facial massages. I don't look my age do I?”
One restaurant patron, Mr Kim Busik, 69, feels that seniors need to think themselves young, to stay young. “When you look around, everyone looks so old. It's so hard to find good-looking old men,” they said.
Mr Kim said they remain youthful by taking care of their skin - they go for facial massages and moisturises every day. They also go to the disco three times a week with their girlfriend - when she's off from their duties as a grandmother.
“We go out and socialise with other people and we eat at good places. This is how we should spend our time,” they said.
SENIORS NEED ROMANTIC LOVE TOO
Buddhist Nun Hui Yoo, who heads the largest senior citizens centre in Seoul, encourages this attitude towards ageing. They said:
We act like we are oblivious to it, but there are stories of romance and love triangles at our centre. And I notice that seniors who express this love tend to be healthier too.
And with 40 per cent of the population projected to be over the age of 60 by 2050, they think society has to shift towards a more holistic way of caring for this growing demographic.
They noted: “In many countries, their concept of welfare is very care-oriented. We believe welfare isn't only about physical welfare, but also cultural welfare.”

On that note, they see nothing wrong with seniors having fun, going to discos and even finding love there.
“When they immerse themselves in a mixed-sex environment, it activates their endorphins and generates happy hormones; it is their way of staying young,” they said.

The U.S. Navy has a ship-killing problem. The service has, over the past 25 years, neglected the basic mission to sink and destroy enemy ships. Now, with the Russian and Chinese navies on the horizon, the Navy is looking at ways of making its ships more lethal—by repurposing missiles as ship-killers.
The problem started with the end of the Cold War. Defense budget cuts in the 1990s slashed the size of the navy, and pushed back a replacement for the venerable Harpoon missile. This was understandable—with the demise of the Soviet Navy, the U.S. Navy had no peer in projecting sea power.
9/11 further shifted priorities. After the attacks in New York and Washington D.C. the service shifted towards support of land operations, particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa. Not much need for an anti-ship missile there, either.
In the meantime, the rest of the world has not stood still. The Russian Navy is crawling back from starvation budgets of the last twenty years. Russia is an enthusiastic user of naval forces, sending them wherever Russian interests lie, in places like Iran, Syria, and Venezuela.
The biggest concern is China, which has made modernizing air and naval forces the number one defense priority. The People's Liberation Army Navy now totals more than 300 ships of all types, and China's shipyards are continously cranking out new aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and amphibious vessels.
The U.S. Navy is now, belatedly, studying ways to spread anti-ship firepower across the fleet. One answer is to give existing missiles the ability to attack surface vessels—the SM-6 air defense missile , now entering the fleet, is gaining the ability to engage ships.
The SM-6 is the latest iteration of the venerable Standard air defense missile that has armed Navy ships for decades. SM-6 is capable of engaging aircraft, ballistic missile, and even cruise missiles, and is even capable of being provided targeting information by E-2D Hawkeyes under the Navy's combat networking system.
Almost all U.S. Navy combat ships will carry the SM-6. SM-6 fits in vertical launch silos on all destroyers and cruisers, and most of these ships have a hundred or more silos. The older Harpoon system had to be carried externally in canister launchers, limiting the number of missiles that could carry.
The SM-6's biggest drawback as a ship-killer? It doesn't have a very large warhead, making it more of a ship-damager. In the 1980s, the U.S. Navy struck a small Iranian patrol boat with five SM-1 missiles , an earlier version of the SM-6, and still failed to sink it.
The SM-6 as an anti-ship missile is not a one-missile solution to Navy's anti-ship problem. A larger, purpose-built missile carried in large numbers is still under development. One alternative a new anti-ship version of the Tomahawk cruise missile; another, the Long-Range Ant-Ship Missile, is a derivative of the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).
For now, though, there's only one active U.S. Navy ship that actually sank another vessel:the 218-year-old U.S.S. Constitution.
– The Detroit Police Department is testing out stun guns and is working to determine how officers will use them.
Following years of debate on the issue, the Detroit Board of Police Commissioners in May gave the OK to a proposal by police Chief James Craig to use stun guns.
Craig has argued that they're a tool for officers that can help save lives, since they offer an alternative to an officer using a gun. He's familiar with them after working in Los Angeles and Portland, Maine which are among many cities where departments use stun guns.
MLive.com reports the trial period started in November, with camera-equipped stun guns being issued to 30 officers. Police say the stun guns begin recording video as soon as they are removed from their holsters.
Detroit police haven't said when they expect stun guns to be fully implemented.
Previous efforts, dating back to the early 2000s, to make stun guns available to Detroit officers didn't gain traction. In light of recent national concerns of police shootings of unarmed suspects, the use stun guns. as well as other alternative to lethal force — including rubber bullets or bean-bag propelling rifles — has been discussed in comm unites across the U.S.
Critics of stun gun use by cops, however, note that the weapons can still be deadly. The Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality is among those who have spoken out against the DPD plan.

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station must have been delighted to get a special delivery from a Scottish whisky company. But any dreams of “one small nip for man” soon evaporated when they opened the package from the Ardbeg Distillery.
Instead of a case of single malt, the Russian rocket brought them a tiny supply of malt molecules with fragments of charred oak from the barrels in which whisky matures. Test tubes of the microscopic particles were delivered by a Progress 45 cargo ship in early November for an experiment to help scientists discover how the compounds react in a weightless environment and produce new flavours.
The organic molecules were crafted by whisky experts at the distillery on the island of Islay which is owned by the Glenmorangie company. The vials were filled with a set of chemicals called “terpenes” which help produce a whisky's aroma. Scientists want to see how the chemicals matured with the oak in space over two years while similar tests are carried out back on Earth at Houston, Texas, and at a warehouse at the distillery itself.
By comparing the results they hope to discover how the molecules work together. The out-of-this-world experiment, led by US-based space research company NanoRacks LLC, was revealed at the International Science Festival in Edinburgh today.
Michael Johnson, Chief Technical Officer of NanoRacks LLC, said: “By doing this microgravity experiment on the interaction of terpenes and other molecules with the wood samples provided by Ardbeg we will learn much about flavours, even extending to applications like food and perfume. At the same time it should help Ardbeg find new chemical building blocks in their own flavour spectrum.”
Dr Bill Lumsden, Head of Distilling and Whisky Creation at Ardbeg, said: “This experiment will throw new light on the effect of gravity on the maturation process. We are all tremendously excited by this experiment. Who knows where it will lead?”

If you might have the impression that Barack Obama was the first US president that established close ties with various terrorist organizations across the world, you would be bitterly disappointed when you learn the truth. Even though Washington has always been pretty vocal about fighting terrorism, as a matter of fact, it nurtured various terrorist groups across the globe to undermine unwanted governments, seeking destabilization and consequent toppling of those governments that refused to bow to the so-called Western champions of democracy.
That's exactly how Washington created al-Qaeda back in 1988 to fight Soviet influence in Afghanistan. Similarly, a quarter of a century later, the Obama administration created and armed the so-called Syrian opposition, that was later transformed into a dangerous and pretty disgusting weapon – ISIS.
It should also be noted that out of a number of various groups that form the core of ISIS, Jabhat al-Nusra has always been the most combat-capable one. It would regularly face the Syrian army units on the field of battle in northwest regions of Syria. In turn, Jabhat al-Nusra is formed by 13 different subgroups, that do only share a common command structure among them. But should Washington at some point abandon its support of Jabhat al-Nusra, the fighting capacity of these subgroups would be severely diminished. That's why the United States refused to abandon its ugly brainchild for years, even when the circumstances would demand otherwise. Back in 2012 the White House was forced into recognizing this group as terrorist organization, but that was pretty much it as far as the War on Terror is concerned.
It's true that Pentagon has wasted thousands of tons of ordinance, while pretending that it's trying to destroy ISIS and its affiliates in Iraq and Syria, but there has been no real struggle as it was officially admitted by the US State Department spokesperson Mark Toner.
Moreover, according to the revelations made by a Jabhat al-Nusra militant in their interview for the German journal Focus, Washington has been directly supplying the group with TOW systems to increase its fighting capacity.
But when Trump surprised everyone by winning the recent presidential election, the Obama administration has started covering up its criminal activities in the remaining 70 days before the new president is inaugurated. Thus, the group that was engaged in a number of fishy schemes of the neocons over the years has found itself in the “to be cleaned up” list.
Pentagon knows the location of every hiding that shelters terrorist leaders, as it has been been repeatedly stated by US officials, however those hidings remained undamaged for years. Before Trump got elected a single successful operation was carried out that actually resulted in a Jabhat al-Nusra commander being killed, but it remains unclear whether this operation was carried out by the Russians or the Americans, which leads us to the conclusion that Washington is more interested in propaganda wars than in actual struggle against terrorists.
But now the Washington Post would report that President Obama ordered the Pentagon to find and kill the leaders of Jabhat al-Nusra. US officials believe that this decision reflects Obama's concern that it is turning parts of Syria into a new base of operations for al-Qaeda on Europe's southern doorstep. Obama's new order gives the U.S. military's Joint Specia – Operations Command, or JSOC, wider authority and additional intelligence-collection resources to go after al-Nusra's broader leadership, not just al-Qaeda veterans or those directly involved in external plotting. Obama's new order gives the Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, wider authority and additional intelligence-collection resources to go after al-Nusra's broader leadership, not just al-Qaeda veterans or those directly involved in external plotting. The Washington Post notes that Pentagon would deploy additional armed drones and intelligence-collection assets in the airspace over northwestern Syria, an area that had been sparsely covered by the United States until now because of its proximity to advanced Russian air-defense systems and aircraft.
All this looks like an awkward attempt to justify Obama's prior reluctance to do anything about radical terrorists. Still, most Western media sources remain silent about the fact that Obama's newfound determination is provoked by the fact that Trump is taking office pretty soon. Should there be an inquiry into the activities of the Obama administration after it's gone, those terrorist leaders would be able to testify against Obama and their affiliates, that's why they are being murdered in a hurry now.

It is heartening to see Democratic leaders in Congress shifting to an oppositional posture with the incoming Donald Trump administration and its Republican enablers in the legislature.
Shortly after the election, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who will lead the Democratic minority in the Senate, had been making noises about finding common ground with Trump. But they told The Washington Post's Greg Sargent this week that Democrats will not have any part in formulating “half-baked” Obamacare replacements should Republicans go through with repealing the health reform law. “If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it,” Schumer said.

That's a good start, but more tests will come when Trump tries to appeal for Democratic support on issues the party has historically supported. Resisting Trump on their infrastructure proposal, for example, may prove politically difficult. But it's necessary, given that Trump's plan is garbage.
During the campaign, Trump made a big deal of their plan to rebuild American infrastructure. Their initial, vague proposal envisioned a debt-financed $550 billion minimum investment in infrastructure projects. In its vague, embryonic form Trump's plan wasn't the worst idea they had ever come up with, even if the mathematics of it conflicted horribly with the rest of their economic agenda. But they have since fleshed out the proposal a bit, and the details reveal it to be a plan to redirect public funds to the pockets of developers and investors.
The Economic Policy Institute put out a big paper on Thursday laying out the economic promise of a sensible public-investment strategy and explaining how Trump's plan (at least as it has been laid out now) is basically a joke. As the institute notesd, there is a tested, proven, straightforward infrastructure policy for boosting employment and economic growth: Have the government fund infrastructure projects. “Governments — federal, state, and local — have been financing infrastructure for decades, and it works.”
The benefits of this straightforward approach are manifest. Governments will fund construction projects that, while necessary, may not provide sufficient profit incentive for private companies to take on. The short- and long-term economic return on these investments are generally quite high, both in terms of job creation and economic growth.
The alternative to direct public financing is public-private partnerships. These arrangements already exist and, as the institute noted, are of dubious value: “A larger private role in financing infrastructure provides no efficiency gains, but opens up many avenues for crony capitalism, corruption, and rampant inequality of public investments across communities.”
What Trump is proposing, however, is essentially just a subsidy for investors that will, by some unexplained magic, result in new and improved infrastructure springing up all across the land. “The Trump infrastructure plan is not just a simple [public-private partnership],” the Economic Policy Institute explained. “Instead, the details released so far indicate only that it is a plan to give tax credits to private financiers and developers, period. Specifically, Trump's plan is to provide a tax credit equal to 82 percent of the equity amount that investors commit to financing infrastructure.”

There's no guarantee that these tax credits will be used to fund new infrastructure or projects that might not otherwise be worth a developer's attention. Investors could just direct those funds to infrastructure projects that have already been in the works or proven moneymakers. Throwing money at developers is a great way to make those developers rich, but it does nothing to create new infrastructure or stimulate job creation. “Trump's plan frames the infrastructure problem as a lack of innovative financing options. This is nonsense,” the institute concluded. “The problem is that politicians don't want to ask taxpayers to pay for valued infrastructure.”
Nonetheless, Democrats can expect Trump to raise a huge stink over infrastructure and cast them as hypocrites if they refuse to sign on to their proposal. As with the health care fight, however, the greater risk comes with agreeing to a terrible plan like this out of fear of short-term political blowback.
Police officers in Tennessee, Missouri and Georgia were shot Friday only hours after five officers were ambushed and killed in Dallas.
In at least one of the incidents, law enforcement officials say the gunman was motivated by recent police shootings of black men.
“Authorities in Tennessee say a man who opened fire on a highway in Tennessee targeted police officers and others because they were troubled by incidents involving black people and law enforcement officers,” the Associated Press reports.
A press release from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation says that the suspect, 37-year-old Lakeem Keon Scott, a black male, targeted only white individuals in the attack. A local newspaper carrier lost their lives while three others, including the police officer, were injured by the gunfire.
Details behind the other shootings in Missouri and Georgia are unclear at the moment.
According to local reports, the Missouri officer was ambushed and shot in the neck while sitting in their police car by a black male. The suspect was later located and arrested hiding in an area home.
Motive for the ambush attack has not yet been released.
The Georgia officer, who was shot multiple times and hit in the abdomen while investigating a damaged vehicle, is also expected to survive.
Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress similarly claimed that no motive was known at the time.
“You start to wonder. But any motive of why this happened this morning would be speculation,” they said.

Time to End Big-Labor's Corrosive Influence on the Federal Government
By Gov. Scott Walker
In 2012, American taxpayers shelled out some $156 million to do the bidding of big-government union bosses. Federal workers spent more than 3.3 million hours that year doing union work, instead of serving the government.
It's a scheme that could only have been hatched in Washington. It's called “official time,” and it allows government employees to work full-time for federal union bosses on the taxpayers' dime. It's just one of the reasons why action is required to end the corrosive influence big labor has on our federal government.
As president, I would stop that influence cold by eliminating federal government unions and returning power back to where it belongs: in the hands of hardworking taxpayers.
This idea is not new. Even President Franklin D. Roosevelt, one of America's most revered liberals, realized just how counter-intuitive it is to allow union bosses to advocate against the best interests of the government. Union bargaining, Roosevelt said, “cannot be transplanted into the public service.”
In fact, until 1962, federal law explicitly prohibited federal workers from collectively bargaining. President Kennedy, however, shrewdly realized that by allowing public sector employees to unionize at the federal level, Democrats would stand to gain votes and hefty political contributions. They were right.
Federal union political donations go overwhelmingly to liberal political candidates and causes. In the 2014 election cycle alone, the largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees, contributed more than $943,000 to political candidates – 93 percent of which went to Democrats. Not to be outdone, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents employees across more than 30 federal agencies and departments, gave more than 95 percent of its $550,050 in candidate contributions to Democrats. These lopsided donations in support of Democrats have been happening for decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the political donations of unions and other groups.
What's more, federal unions are a force for making our government less efficient and accountable. Case in point is union opposition to a commonsense congressional proposal that would simply give the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs the ability to “remove or demote a VA employee based on performance or misconduct.” In case the union bosses hadn't noticed, VA has a lot of problems nowadays, and difficulty firing bad employees is one of them.
Federal unions are also at the forefront of keeping federal employees involved in egregious misconduct on the federal payroll. When an employee at a VA hospital in Kansas City, Mo., allowed a patient to wander out of a secure psychiatry unit in 2014, VA officials sought to fire the employee. But the union representing the worker wouldn't allow that. Instead, it fought to reduce the penalty to a suspension, and later helped the employee get back pay for the time they were under suspension. Union protection also prevented the government from firing a USDA food inspector who failed to discover a massive rat infestation in a pasta-production plant. The union won back-pay for the employee despite their actions jeopardizing the health of consumers. These are just a few examples.
And let's not forget the fact that federal unions interfere with the ability of the government to serve the people. Consider the millions of hours each year federal employees spend working for big-labor bosses, rather than the American people. In 2012, taxpayers subsidized more than 3.3 million hours of “official time,” in which government employees are paid to work exclusively for union bosses, at a cost of $156 million to American taxpayers.
At the IRS, which has been busy attacking conservative groups instead of actually helping Americans deal with their taxes, more than 200 employees work full-time for big-government union bosses at taxpayer expense. The situation is even worse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where in fiscal year 2013, more than 250 employees – including medical professionals – collected taxpayer-funded salaries to work for union bosses instead of veterans. The fact that this is occurring at a time when the IRS and VA lurch from one scandal to another and struggle to provide basic services to those they are charged with serving underscores the need for reform.
Under current law, employees at some federal agencies like the FBI, CIA, Secret Service and the Government Accountability Office are already prevented from unionizing. The sensitive work done at these agencies requires employee accountability and efficiency, which federal unions often work against. We should give all federal agencies the ability to operate without the limitations and inefficiencies federal unions cause.
As president, I will work with Congress to prohibit federal employee unions because it's the right thing for workers, taxpayers and the future of the American government. I have no illusions that this effort will be easy. Opponents will say that we're robbing federal workers of their rights and workplace protections. Nothing could be further from the truth. Total compensation for federal employees is already 30 to 40 percent higher than their civilian counterparts and they already enjoy strong workplace protections and high job security rates.
The vast majority of federal workers do an outstanding job and deserve our appreciation and protection, which they will receive under a Walker administration. But taxpayers deserve the same thing. One of the ways I will achieve that is by removing the corrosive influence of federal unions from our government.

In an article written last week for Time Magazine, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins started their piece by saying something they have become known for repeating,
We wouldn't claim our young kids are liberals or Libertarian, so why are we saddling them with our religious labels?
This sentiment has become well known and used by atheist, secularists and humanists all over, and I even used a similar argument in my book Parenting Without God, which talks a lot about giving the tools so that children can label themselves and come to their own conclusions and beliefs.
The article itself is centered around a report that a,
local government council of the London borough of Islington was reported in the Islington Gazette as having banned pork products from primary school dinners.
And while the actual reasoning is unclear, Dawkins reports that,
The underlying point was clarified by another spokesperson from the council, as quoted in the Gazette and requoted in The Independent,one of Britain's most respected national newspapers: “Young children, some as young as four-years-old, of different religious and ethnic backgrounds may not know which foods contain pork, or may not realise the importance of avoiding it due to their culture or beliefs.”
And there is the problem Dawkins sees glaring right at him; “their beliefs”.
“Would you ever speak of a four-year-old's political beliefs? Hannah is a socialist four-year-old, Mark a conservative,” Dawkins asks.
Of course not, because we all understand that children are too naive and young to understand the complicated world of politics. Dawkins argues you better have a good argument for believing that labeling a child by their parents religion is justified, but both they and myself cannot think of one.
But Dawkins does however give a little room for tradition,
But there really is an important difference between including your children in harmless traditions, and forcing on them un-evidenced opinions about the nature of life or the cosmos. Tradition is fine where it amounts to songs or literature, styles of dress or architecture. But tradition is a terrible basis for ethics, or beliefs about the origin of the universe or the evolution of life.
Indoctrinating your opinions into the vulnerable minds of your children is bad enough. Perhaps worse is the defeatist assumption, almost universally made by society at large, including secular society, that children as a matter of fact do automatically inherit the beliefs of their parents and our language should reflect this. Non-religious as well as religious people buy into the notion that children should be labeled with one religious name or another.
They continue,
And here Dawkins makes a pretty good assumption that I feel is often overlooked in polls about religious grown and decline, stating that many of these projections only work on the assumption that children growing up in these countries continue their parents religious tradition.
Finally Dawkins uses feminism as a great example of how as a society our consciousness has been raised about how we word such statements,
Feminists have successfully raised our consciousness about sex-biased language. Nobody nowadays talks about “one man one vote,” or “the rights of man.” The use of “man” in such a context raises immediate hackles. Even those who use sexist language know they are doing it, may even do it deliberately to annoy. The point is that our consciousness has been raised. Our language has changed because we have become aware of hidden assumptions that we previously overlooked.
 They are more than correct here as generations grow and take over we see certain traditions and social norms change with time and heightened awareness. It is time as Dawkins says in closing that we ought to,
[…] raise our consciousness, and the consciousness of society, about the religious labeling of children. Let's all mind our religious language just as we have learned to over sexist language. “Catholic child,” “Muslim child,” “Hindu child,” “Mormon child” — all such phrases should make us cringe. Whenever you hear somebody speak of a “Catholic child,” stop them in their tracks: There's no such thing as a Catholic child.
Let's let children be children and stop burdening them with our labels and forcing them to conform to a belief system they have no say in joining. I believe this is both a religious and non-religious issue and it is time we change this social norm once and for all.
Mitch Boyer's Dachshund Vivian is like many Dachshunds.  They are a big dog trapped inside a small dog's body. To help her, the writer and photo illustrator decided to use their skills to turn Vivian into the dog they think they are. The results are these brilliant comical photos.
Mitch says, “Initially, I was inspired after finding Romain Laurent's quirky photographic style. In one of their music videos, a giant head is laying on the boardwalk in Coney Island, while singing. That image stuck in my mind and was the seed that led to the rest of this project.
“Like many Dachshunds, my dog Vivian thinks she's much larger than they actually are. I thought it would be fun to make a photo series where their physical size was just as large as their personality.”
The photo series has become so popular, Mitch has now turned them into a children's book. Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn is about a big dog moving to the big city. Mitch hopes the book will help children going through big changes, such as moving, by watching and learning as Vivian learns to love their new home. The pair have launched a Kickstarter campaign to get their project off the ground.
Vivian's not the first dog to get the supersizing treatment. See Juji, the giant Goldendoodle.

7/22/2016 – In a world that seems to have gone mad, it was yet another act of terror that has almost left us numb after so many in succession. Gunmen had entered the Olympia mall in Munich, killing eight. The laws of probability said that even chess might someday become a casualty and today seemed like that day might have come as a massive chess event took place right there expecting over ten thousand children.
It was to be a beautiful chess bonanza all for children lasting the entire week. Spearheaded by GM Sebastien Siebrecht, with the support of Mayor Deiter Reiter, Councilwoman Kathrin Abele, and the Center Manger Christoph von Oelhafen, a slew of non-stop chess activities were to be held all day in the mall's generous spaces aimed directly at children and adolescents. More than 15 school groups from all over Munich would come to enjoy the colorful chess experience.
GM Sebastian Siebrecht teaching chess to children
Classes of schoolchildren were scheduled to come from all over the city. Thousands in all.
A popular place for all, parents looked forward to the opportunity to enjoy chess with their young ones
There would be detailed chess lessons for classes and groups, simuls by GM Siebrecht himself, national junior player My Lin Tran, and WFM Anna Endress, 5-time German Youth champion. There would also be blitz events, Beat the Grandmaster challenges (with a generous handicap for the challengers), playing with the ChessBase children's program Fritz and Chesster, and more.
The event and detailed program were announced on the pages of the
German Chess Federation
Chess would be present in all its shapes and forms to promote the game
The final activity of each day would be a fun blitz tournament
It was a dream event, until all hell broke loose. The immediacy of the Internet and cable TV broke the news as it took place: gunmen entering a mall in Munich killing six (later expanded to eight), with three on the loose. For most of us, we just watched in a mix of horror and detachment: horror for what it was, and detachment because of the almost constant flow of such announcements in the last weeks.
This was the front page of CNN.com
The round of Bilbao had finished already when a Skype message came from Nakamura telling me they had heard via Italian TV a chess event had been running in the mall where the tragedies were taking place.
At first I thought that was ridiculous. What event? I am up-to-date on the chess events, and then remembered the obvious: there is a lot more happening in the chess world than elite tournaments, something we can all too easily forget as we follow the big names on Playchess.
I contacted Holger (Lieske) the sysop of Playchess and friend, about it. They quickly dug up the truth, and I was stunned. It was far worse that I had ever imagined. More than 10 thousand children were expected to partake, and Friday would easily be one of the biggest draws with the greatest crowds.
CNN had the news with its usual flow of updates recounting the efforts to find and capture those responsible. There was no news of chess, which in itself was not surprising, but nor did they say who the dead were. We immediately contacted GM Sebastian Siebrecht, who responded almost as quickly with a short but reassuring email:
Hallo Holger,
Hallo Albert,
wir sind wohlauf und in Sicherheit.
Zu dem Zeitpunkt gab ich gerade ein Simultan und wir hatten volles Haus.
Alle sind wohlbehalten und unversehrt.
Beste Grüße,
Sebastian
Translation:
Hi Holger,
Hi Albert,
We are well and safe.
At the time I was giving a simul and we had a full house.
All are safe and unharmed.
Best regards,
Sebastian

One of the marquee features in Android 6.0 is Google Now on Tap, a new system-wide contextual assistant that's wildly impressive -- some of the time.
The problem is that in its present form, Now on Tap is really only useful in a small and rather limited series of scenarios -- and by and large, it doesn't work consistently well enough to be something you can depend upon. It'll almost certainly get better over time, but for now, it's more of a neat trick you try once in a while than something you use all the time.
As a result, a lot of folks aren't thrilled about the fact that Now on Tap takes over Android's system-wide Home button shortcut -- you know, the one that'd let you jump from anywhere on your device straight to the full Google Now interface in previous versions of Android. Not surprisingly, the Marshmallow-related question I'm asked more than any other is: "How do I get the damn Google Now shortcut back?!"
Well, I've got good news: If you aren't using Now on Tap much and would rather have the Google Now shortcut back in its place, all it takes is a few quick taps to make it happen.
Here's all you've gotta do:
On your Marshmallow phone or tablet, open the system settings. Select Google (under the section labeled "Personal"), then Search & Now, and then Now Cards. See the option called "Now on Tap"? Uncheck the toggle next to it. (It'll appear gray instead of blue once it's unchecked.)
And that's it: Once you've finished those two steps, tap and hold your Home button from anywhere in the system -- be it on your home screen or within any app or process -- and you'll be taken right to Google Now, just like you were in the Lollipop era. And yes, this'll work regardless of whether you're using the Google Now Launcher or a third-party alternative.
The only difference from the past is that with Marshmallow, you always tap and hold the Home button instead of swiping up on it -- and that little animation with the Google logo (pictured at the top of this story) doesn't appear like it used to -- but the end result is identical. And that's ultimately what matters.
If you ever decide you want to give Now on Tap another go, all you have to do is follow the same steps described above, only check the toggle next to Now on Tap instead of unchecking it. Easy enough, right?

The Best Tent-Only Campgrounds on the California Coast
I just love the golden state and with summer coming quick, I'm itching to get out there and do some coastal camping in California. The sun, the salty air. Something about it just makes you feel so good.
The only thing that's tough about the California coast is it can be hard to get off the beaten path without going far into the backcountry. And well…that's not always convenient. Sometimes you just want to hop in your car, drive and hour, and pitch a tent, and not have to worry about preparation. But that doesn't mean that you want to be camping in a paved parking lot full of RVs either.
If you are looking to soak in some of that California soul, here's the best places to go camping in California where there are no cars allowed.
Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park
Getting to the Channel Islands requires some effort, but with the chance to encounter dolphin pods, mola molas, and whales in the Santa Barbara Channel, the one hour Island Packers boat ride to Santa Cruz Island is all part of the fun. While camping is allowed year round on all 5 of the islands in Channel Islands National Park, the Scorpion Ranch campground at Santa Cruz is the most accessible for a weekend jaunt and also has the most developed facilities. Once the ferry lands on the island, it is a half mile walk from the pier to the large campground, which sits in a grove of trees surrounded by grasslands and coastal sage scrub. Once you get settled, there are 6 different trails that leave from the campground ranging from a quick 1/2 mile stroll to a more strenuous 8-mile hike that leads to expansive coastal vistas. What makes camping on Santa Cruz Island really unique, however, are the opportunities to get out on the water. Sea kayaking here is world-class with sea caves, rocky coastline, and kelp forests, and for an extra fee, Island Packers rents and transports kayaks out to the island. And don't forget your snorkel and thick wetsuit. Sightings of sea lions whizzing around the kelp forest are almost guaranteed. Reservations are required and sites get booked up months in advance, so plan ahead.
Planning a trip? Check out our post about the Top Things to Do on Santa Cruz Island!
Angel Island State Park Campground
With ferries departing from all over the San Francisco Bay area, Angel Island State Park in the middle of the Bay offers a quick and quiet escape from the commotion of the city. Coastal campsites are spread out all over the island, with views of the SF Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the famous cityscape, and the rolling Marin Headlands. All sites have potable water and a pit toilet. To explore the island, hit the trail to the top of Mt. Livermore, the island's tallest point, or rent a bike from the Angel Island Company and cruise around the island's permitter. When that stomach starts to growl, head to the Angel Island Cantina for lunch and wash down some super fresh Hog Island Oysters with a locally brewed Lagunitas IPA. Reserve your campsite here.
Wildcat Camp
Secluded in a grassy seaside meadow along Point Reyes National Seashore, a camping weekend at Wildcat Camp is a perfect place for beginner backpackers to get their feet wet. From the parking lot, the campground is a 5.5 moderate mile hike from the Palomarine trailhead in Bolinas. Along the way, the trail is packed with unobstructed views of the Pacific, as long as fog hasn't rolled in. Besides the views and beach access from Wildcat, the main attraction is Alamere Falls, a waterfall that crashes down from the bluff onto the beach and is the only major waterfall in Point Reyes. Reservations are highly recommended, especially for the warmer months, as sites do book up in advance. Sites 6 and 7, while small, are considered the best due their isolated location and views from high up on the bluff. All sites are equipped with a grill and picnic table, meaning campers don't have to skimp on meals during overnight trips.
Andrew Molera State Park, Big Sur
While most of the places to go camping in California's Big Sur get snatched up months in advance, the 1/2-mile walk to the 24 first-come, first-served campsites at Andrew Molera State Park is enough deterred some campers. This means if you arrive early enough in the day, you might just get lucky and snag a site right along the Big Sur River which runs right through the middle of the Park. The campground is an open meadow, so sites don't afford a ton of privacy, but location more than makes up for that. Twenty miles south of Carmel, Andrew Molera has some of the best hiking trails in Big Sur, including an 8.8 mile loop along a coastal bluff with spectacular views that also provides access to a remote beach cove. If the loop is too ambitious, the campground itself is just a short walk down the river to Molera Beach, a two-mile long strip of quintessential central coast sand.
**Update: Part of the Big Sur road was washed out this summer. Make sure to check current park status before you head out to Andrew Molera.
Castle Rock State Park
Nestled high up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, Castle Rock State Park has two campgrounds located deep in the redwoods. The first is the Castle Rock Trail Camp which is a 2.6-mile hike from the main entrance parking lot. The 20 first-come, first served sites are each equipped with a fire ring and a table. The campground also has vault toilets, safe drinking water, and firewood available for purchase. Those looking for a bit more seclusion can venture further to the primitive Water Gap Trail Camp, where there are only 6 sites but no water. From either of these sites, campers have easy access to the Skyline to Sea Trail where they can spend the day hiking through old growth forests, with some wide open views of the Saratoga Gap. And while not directly on the coast, you'll still get that ocean breeze, and with the beach less than thirty miles away, you can easily make a side trip on your way home.
If these don't float your boat, make sure to check out my post about Hipcamp, a new reservation system where you can reserve campsites throughout California.

The St. John's-based production company Opera on the Avalon is apologizing for an outdoor billboard that struck some people as homophobic.
The company's billboard for its upcoming production of A Midsummer Night's Dream said the show is "Filled with more fairies than St. John's on Pride Day."
The billboard, on Bonaventure Avenue in central St. John's, sparked a flurry of comments on Tuesday on Facebook and Twitter.
Cheryl Hickman, artistic director of Opera on the Avalon, said the company immediately agreed to pull down the sign after it received complaints.
"We apologize," they said. "That wasn't our intent. We don't want to offend anyone."
By Wednesday afternoon, a new sign promoting the company's production of La Boheme — featuring the tag line of "Love, despair, poverty, intermission, illness, death" — was installed in its place.
Hickman said the sign was meant to be humorous.
"We are an inclusive company and we want everyone to come see our shows and to enjoy these, and if anyone is offended, we want to address that right away," they said.
They pointed out that Opera on the Avalon's crew is a gay-positive one.
"I don't think there are very many careers full of gay and lesbian people than there are in opera," they said.
"These are our friends, these are our colleagues, these are people we work with every day, and we would never want to offend anyone."
Not a term of endearment
Noah Davis-Power, former president of St. John's Pride Inc., said the flippant use of the term "fairy" targeted at gay men will leave a negative impression on younger members of the opera group.
According to Davis-Power, the term may strike some members of the LGBT community as funny, but that doesn't reflect the feelings of every member.
"I think humour is a great tool to make difficult issues more palatable and can be used toward educating people who do have issues with it, but I think that using words like that … when you're putting that on corporate-sized billboards, that takes the humour too far," they said.
Davis-Power said the use of the term is still too close to bullying, an issue that is a big problem for LGBT and other groups.
"It was just completely inappropriate to call people a name, and we're a marginalized community. If any community was targeted like that it would be an issue," they said.
"It's just not OK. Marketing is supposed to be a positive thing for everybody who sees it, and this certainly was not a positive thing for all of our community."
'Innocent' joke gone wrong
St. John's resident Gordon Little said there are still a lot of negative memories associated with a word like that for many people.
"I don't think they thought it through very well. I mean, it's really offensive to a lot of people. A word like that, some people might be OK with it and some might think it's a laugh, but anyone who grew up and was ever called a fairy — that's got to bring back a lot of bad memories for a lot of people," said Little.
While Little said they aren't gay, they can appreciate the bad feelings that may have been stirred up by the term.
"I grew up as a big guy and was called fat and it's like, if someone said it was a bunch of fatties, more fatties than were at a Weight Watchers group, I mean, that might be funny to some, but not funny to others," they said.
Reaction to the billboard has been divided on social media.
"We've made so much progress to eliminate discrimination in our city & province. Opera on the Avalon have taken a huge step backwards," Adam Quirk said on Twitter.
"As a gay man, I don't really mind," Matthew Smith wrote in a comment on CBC Newfoundland and Labrador's Facebook page. "It's a joke! Lighten up."
Far from a villain! Benedict Cumberbatch plays the charming English gent for Jimmy Fallon appearance as they promote Star Trek
Their career has skyrocketed since they landed the plum role of the iconic detective on the BBC's Sherlock.
And Benedict Cumberbatch discussed their transition to blockbuster films as they stopped by Late Night With Jimmy Fallon to promote Star Trek Into Darkness.
The 36-year-old British actor told the television host of the upcoming sci-fi flick: 'I'm really excited. I think it's going to be great.'

Pleased to be here: Benedict Cumberbatch stopped by Late Night With Jimmy Fallon on Friday to discuss Star Trek Into Darkness
Benedict looked stylish for the appearance in a blazer layered over a blue button-up shirt, grey trousers and black leather shoes.
The London-born star touched on a variety of subjects including the experience of producing Sherlock, of which they gushed to Jimmy: 'We're over the moon about the reaction to it.'
Benedict also expressed their dissatisfaction with their admirers' self-given nickname, Cumberb*****es, and mentioned that they and co-star Martin Freeman occupy themselves on set by challenging each other to do impersonations.
Gracious: The Sherlock star said of the BBC series, 'We're over the moon about the reaction to it'
In Star Trek Into Darkness, Benedict appears as a villain alongside heavy hitters including Chris Pine, Alice Eve, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana.
They told MTV.com of filming the project: 'It was exhausting but so exhilarating. These guys had been training a little bit longer than I had, because I was late to the process of being part of the film.
'But one of the best parts was the fight rehearsals with Zach and our amazing, amazing stunt doubles. I was dragged up to a standard -- to their standard -- by the most extraordinary experts.'
Your turn: The actor revealed that they and co-star Martin Freeman do impersonations to stay occupied on set before challenging Jimmy to a competition of their own
Benedict will finish 2013 with a slew of star-studded projects.
In November, they will appear in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts before starring in Twelve Years A Slave alongside Brad Pitt and Michael Fassbender.
The actor also secured the coveted role of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and will debut a stunning transformation in 2014's The Fifth Estate.
Meanwhile, Benedict recently completed production on two instalments of The Hobbit franchise, The Destruction Of Smaug and There And Back Again.
Full steam ahead: The 36-year-old will follow Star Trek with an impressive five films over the next year
× Mike Pence campaigns in Holland days before election
HOLLAND, Mich. — For the second time this week, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence campaigned in West Michigan on Saturday.
The Indiana governor spoke around 9:30 at the Park Theatre in Holland Saturday morning to rally supporters ahead of Tuesday's election.
Polling shows a tightening race in Michigan between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, causing both campaigns to spend last minute time and money in the state to ramp up support and voter turnout.
On Friday, they spoke to more than 1,000 supporters at the air zoo in Portage. They also stumped for votes in Lansing.
Senator Ted Cruz was also in attendance, encouraging people to get out and vote on Tuesday.
In the past week, Clinton and Trump have both campaigned in Michigan, while several of their surrogates have also stumped for their respective candidates, including Trump's children and Bernie Sanders.
It is as iconic an image from the criminal underworld as the Tommy gun or the getaway car, a grim last act for the unfortunate soul whose life is about to end in a new pair of footwear.
Cement shoes.
One would be hard-pressed to think of a worse way to die than being fitted, as the saying goes, for cement shoes — fate hardening with every passing minute until the time comes to be dumped, feet first, into a watery grave, never to be seen again.
Never again — that is the whole point, and it is exactly why cement shoes are the unicorn of true crime. Everyone can describe them, but who has seen them?
Before Monday, precious few. Which makes the discovery that morning in Brooklyn of a cement-shoed corpse all the more remarkable.
CONNACHT HAVE CONFIRMED that former All Black Mils Muliaina will leave the province at the end of the current season.
The veteran fullback has signed a one-year contract with Guinness Pro12 side Zebre.
Muliaina is heading for Italy next season. Source: Craig Thomas/INPHO
Muliaina joined Connacht just last summer from the Chiefs in Super Rugby and has made ten appearances under head coach Pat Lam. The 100-times capped New Zealand international has been repeatedly praised for their mentoring influence on the squad's young players since arriving in Galway.
However, Lam's squad will be shorn of Muliaina's experience this summer when they head for Italian shores to join Zebre. The Parma-based club are currently rock bottom of the Pro12.
“Even in one quick year, Mils has made a lasting contribution to Connacht rugby,” said head coach Lam of Muliaina's impending departure.
Their influence on and off the field with our young squad has been invaluable and I know the players, particularly the backs, have benefited from their vast experience. A big part of our growth as a team this season has been around challenging each other to reach higher standards and Mils was massive in driving this.
“He has really embraced the Connacht culture and he's made a big effort to get out amongst the community and I know the supporters have enjoyed meeting and getting to know him.

“For me personally it was fantastic to have the opportunity to work with them again and on behalf of everyone, I'd like to thank Mils and wish them all the best in Italy and with Zebre.”
Meanwhile, Muliaina spoke about their excitement at the next chapter in their career:
“I am really looking forward to my move to Italy to join Zebre Rugby,” said Muliaina. “I have always been a big believer of passing my knowledge and experience of the game on to other up and coming rugby players.
With the experience I have had playing in Milan and Rome with the All Blacks, I know the Italians are very passionate about rugby in their country. Joining Zebre allows me to maintain the appetite I have to succeed as a rugby player.
“After chatting to Brendon [Leonard, former Chiefs team-mate who has been in Parma since 2013] about their time in Zebre I am looking forward to an exciting season ahead.”

The Pirate Bay has officially shut down.
The website was only available for users who downloaded a Torrent service as it was not readily available for those on the clear net. It was used to stream music and movies illegally for years, hence its name.
However, Internet backbone Cogent came down on The Pirate Bay by blocking its IP address that were assigned by Cloudflare. Cogent did the same thing last month due to a court order that required the backbone to issue the ban.
Cloudflare helped out and assigned a special IP address for the website at the time in order to keep it running, but it appears as if it will no longer be in use now unless something changes in a drastic manner.
Opening The Pirate Bay now will open up an error that reads “Error 522 Hosting Error Message.”
The move comes at a time when the government is cracking down on websites that are not exactly legal and exist in the Deep Web, which is only accessible to Torrent users. Many are already seeking another site to watch movies online that are similar to The Pirate Bay.
Perhaps the most notorious Deep Web site that got people talking was Silk Road, which was used to sell illegal narcotics, weapons and other illicit products and services.
Letterman put their elderly mother from Indiana to work, and their bits were always funny and heartwarming.
Dorothy Mengering, a masterful pie-maker from a small town in Indiana who “covered” three Winter Olympics for their mischievous son, David Letterman, has died. They were 95.
Mengering, who for years made regular appearances on Letterman's Late Show before Thanksgiving and Mother's Day, died Tuesday at their modest home in Carmel, Ind., according to a rep for the former late-night host.
Seen via satellite from the kitchen of their modest home, Mengering was at their comic best for the feature “Guess Mom's Pies,” in which Letterman had to pick which one of their many favorites they had lovingly prepared for the holidays.
Them first on-camera appearance on the CBS show came during the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, when they offered to bring ice skater Nancy Kerrigan hot chocolate and asked Hillary Clinton if the first lady could get the speed limit adjusted in Connecticut.
“After Lillehammer, I couldn't believe how it all took off,” they told The New York Times in 1996. “I think it's about the idea of mom and of a family. People are eager for families to be like they used to be. Even though there are lots of working moms and single-parent families now, you can still be a family in spite of the size and form it takes.”
Mengering reprised their role as a Late Show “correspondent” for the next two Winter Games in Nagano, Japan and Salt Lake City, and they taped segments from London for Dave as well.
Stephen Colbert, who took over for Letterman on The Late Show in 2015, tweeted out their condolences on Tuesday: "I'm so sorry to hear of Dorothy Mengering's death, and so grateful that Dave shared them with us."
Mengering published a 1996 cookbook, Home Cookin' With Dave's Mom. In it were recipes for “Dave's Fried Baloney Sandwich,” “Jan's Sauerkraut Balls” and “Gretchen's Salad Dressing” — tributes to their son and two daughters — and instructions for how to make pies like blueberry, sour cherry, pecan molasses and chocolate chiffon.
The eldest of three children, Dorothy Hofert was born on July 18, 1921, in Linton, Ind. They studied at Indiana University, and in 1942, they married Harry Joseph Letterman, who had a florist shop. They died of a heart attack in 1973. (Dave's son, Harry, is named after him.)
Ten years later, they wed Hans P. Mengering, a retired structural engineer for an Indianapolis architectural firm. The World War II veteran died in March 2013.
In the interview with The Times, they told a story about how their young son, while working at a local supermarket, once stacked a bunch of cans all the way to the ceiling. Taking one would send them all crashing to the floor.
“I had one of the schoolteachers tell me after Dave got famous that the kids get by with a lot more now,” Mengering said, “because they can see it's not out of meanness, just mischievousness.”
As Canada gets one step closer to legalizing marijuana, the companies producing the drug are seeing a boost in the stock market.
Tuesday morning, the Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation released recommendations on how pot should be regulated in Canada, including taxation recommendations, a minimum purchasing age of 18 years old, and where it should be sold.
At the end of the day, most publically traded marijuana companies' stocks were up across the board.

Emerald Health Therapeutics grew 12 per cent to close at $1.40. Canopy Growth Corp. went up nearly eight per cent and closed at $10.79. Aurora Cannabis Inc. closed a $2.44 – a growth of six per cent. Aphria Inc. grew five per cent to close at $5.34.
WATCH: News conference on Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation's recommendations
Brendan Kennedy, president of Tilray, said the spike is continuing a trend that started after November's U.S. election, where multiple states voted in either medical marijuana laws or recreational marijuana laws.
They said the result may have driven U.S. investors to Canadian public companies because it's the “easiest way for American investors to invest in the cannabis industry.”
Kennedy said some of the specific recommendations that may have helped drive up the stock prices include the way you get marijuana.

The report recommends that it not be sold in stores where alcohol and tobacco are sold, which is a benefit to marijuana sellers.
They also say that the recommendation of keeping the recreational side separate from the existing medical framework is a good idea – a model that is in place in Colorado.
“Otherwise it could have been detrimental to the existing Canadian LPs,” they explained.
Though Tilray isn't a publically traded company, the Washington State-based company sells medical marijuana in the U.S. as well as Canada.

SpaceX's Dragon spaceship, carrying more than 4,100 pounds of cargo and research specimens, descended to a predawn splashdown Monday in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Los Angeles, completing the first re-flight of one of SpaceX's unpiloted supply ships to the International Space Station.
Completing a four-week stay at the space station, the Dragon cargo capsule departed the research outpost Monday at 2:41 a.m. EDT (0641 GMT), when astronaut Jack Fischer commanded the station's robotic arm to release the spacecraft.
Launched June 3 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center aboard a Falcon 9 rocket, the automated logistics carrier delivered nearly 6,000 pounds of equipment and research hardware to the space station.
The capsule made its second trip to the orbiting complex. SpaceX refurbished the craft following its first mission in September and October 2014.
“Dragon's been an incredible spacecraft,” Fischer radioed mission control a few minutes after Dragon left the space station. “I could even say it was slathered in awesome sauce. This baby had almost no problems, which is an incredible feat considering its the first reuse of a Dragon vehicle.”
Items stowed for Dragon's return included live mice from an experiment to investigate the effectiveness of a therapeutic drug to promote bone growth, combating atrophy in astronauts in space and osteoporosis patients on Earth. The mice will be euthanized and examined after landing.
“Most of the 6,000 pounds of cargo carried was science, and almost all the return cargo are precious samples for discoveries we can't wait to see,” Fischer said. “In addition, Dragon brought up a host of external experiments. We've added an external platform for science, a neutron star analyzer and a new solar array that rolled out like a party horn on New Year's Eve.”
Dragon's homecoming was pushed back a day because of rough seas in the splashdown zone around 260 miles (420 kilometers) southwest of Long Beach, California.
Under the control of SpaceX engineers in Hawthorne, California, the Dragon capsule fired its thrusters in three pulses to fly a safe distance away from the space station. A few hours later, the supply freighter braked out of orbit with another rocket firing, jettisoned its disposable unpressurized trunk and service module, then plunged into Earth's atmosphere for a searing re-entry.
Soaring southwest to northeast, the capsule deployed two drogue parachutes and three main chutes before splashing down, SpaceX tweeted at 8:14 a.m. EDT (1214 GMT; 5:14 a.m. PDT).
The return marked the first time a Dragon capsule has splashed down at night. Fischer captured a view of the plasma trail behind the Dragon spacecraft during re-entry as the space station sailed overhead.
A SpaceX recovery team hoisted the craft onto a boat for a two-day trip to the Port of Los Angeles, where time-sensitive cargo and scientific samples will be handed over to NASA and research teams.
SpaceX replaced the heat shield and other parts of the capsule after its 2014 flight, but officials said the primary structure, propulsion system and sections were original articles.
Monday's splashdown concluded SpaceX's 11th resupply mission to the space station. Including flights already accomplished, SpaceX has contracts with NASA for at least 26 cargo flights to the orbital research lab through 2024.
The company's 12th cargo mission is set for launch Aug. 10 from the Kennedy Space Center.

Pirate Bay founder Gottfrid Svartholm will be extradited to Denmark where they face several new hacking charges. In Denmark, Gottfrid is accused of downloading a large number of files, including police records, from the mainframe of IT company CSC. The timing of the extradition is still unknown since among other things the Pirate Bay founder has to await the verdict in their Swedish hacking trial which is due later this week.
Following a hacking-related trial in Sweden last month, Pirate Bay co-founder Gottfrid Svartholm is now expected to go through the same process in Denmark.
The Nacka District Court has decided that Gottfrid can be extradited to the neighboring country where they are accused of hacking into the mainframes of CSC, a Danish IT company working with the Government.
Speaking with TorrentFreak, Gottfrid's mother Kristina Svartholm confirmed that their son will indeed be extradited. When this will take place is yet to be announced as the 28-year-old must first await the verdict in their Swedish trial which is expected to be handed down later this week.
The accusations of the Danish authorities are very similar to those leveled in Sweden. Both cases involve security breaches of IT companies that work for the government.
In Denmark the alleged hacks of CSC took place between April and August 2012. Among other things, Gottfrid and a 20-year old Danish co-defendant are accused of downloading a large number of files from CSC's mainframe systems.
According to the authorities the accessed files include information on wanted persons in the Schengen registers. The motivation for the hacks remains unknown, but the police say it can't be ruled out that changes were made to the records. There are, however, no indications that any of the downloaded files have been exploited.
Commenting on the case, Danish National Police Commissioner Jens Henrik Hojbjerg said the security breach was unacceptable and that an investigation is still ongoing.
“The police take this matter very seriously. It is of course totally unacceptable that it has been possible to gain access to police records, despite the very high safety standards that we demand and expect from our IT supplier,” Hojbjerg said.
If Gottfrid is found guilty in Sweden the extradition to Denmark is expected to be postponed, depending on the length of their sentence. There is also an option for them to appeal the extradition decision but it hasn't been announced whether this will be used.
For the time being the Pirate Bay founder remains in custody.  They are considered a flight risk and is being kept in solitary confinement upon request of the Danish authorities.

Germany didn't begin the World Cup as the favorite. That honor belonged to (ahem) Brazil. But that's a slightly deceptive measure. This was a top-heavy World Cup; not only Brazil but also Germany, Argentina and Spain would have been the front-runners in many past editions of the tournament.
By the end of the World Cup, Germany left little doubt it is the best team in the world. In fact, it may be the best national soccer team ever assembled.
One simple way to compare World Cup winners is by their goal differential throughout the tournament. Germany, with 18 goals scored and four allowed, comes out at a plus-14. This is tied for the best goal differential ever for a World Cup champion; Brazil also scored 18 goals and allowed four in winning the 2002 tournament.
No, the Germans weren't flawless. They tied Ghana in the group stage and had a little more trouble than they should have with Algeria in the Round of 16. But few World Cup champions are perfect in every match. All but three eventual winners took a draw or loss, or required a penalty shootout, along the way (soccer statisticians usually count games that go to penalties as draws).
And some of these teams were fortunate in other respects. Uruguay only needed to play four matches to win the inaugural World Cup in 1930. Uruguay also had the benefit of playing on home soil. Brazil, in 2002, had a favorable draw — China, Costa Rica and Turkey were in its group.
The Germans, by contrast, did this against some tough competition. They took down Argentina and Brazil in the knockout stage, along with a French team that had been playing as well as anyone.
The World Football Elo Ratings provide one way to account for all these factors: a team's strength going into the tournament, its dominance during the tournament itself, the quality of its competition, and whether it was aided by playing at home.
Germany's Elo rating was high to begin with at 2046, which is stronger than a number of World Cup winners. But it gained 150 more points throughout the World Cup (about half of them by beating Brazil 7-1), finishing with a rating of 2196.
This is the highest Elo rating ever for a World Cup champion. The 1962 Brazil team previously held the top spot.
In fact, it's the highest a national soccer team has ever been rated in the Elo system. Before Germany, the highest-rated team of all time had been Hungary in 1954. Hungary's rating peaked at 2166 after winning the World Cup semifinal, but then it lost to West Germany in the tournament's final match.
I'll be curious to see how this year's German team is regarded in barroom arguments around the world, both now and with the benefit of hindsight. It doesn't have a transcendent superstar, although it has a number of players who might rank in the top 20 or 25 in the world. It's often said that the Germans didn't have a distinctive style — although their relentless attacking play represents the new paradigm in world football, and it led to the highest-scoring and perhaps most exciting World Cup in many years.
Other teams — notably Spain from 2008 to 2012, and Brazil under Pele — had longer sustained stretches at the apex of world football. But Germany is young and deep. Mario Götze, who scored the winning goal in the final Sunday, is 22. Thomas Müller and Toni Kroos are 24, and Mesut Özil is 25. The Germans have a good chance to go in as the favorites in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Still, the competition is going to be tough. At the start of the next tournament, Brazil's Neymar and Colombia's James Rodríguez will be just 26, and Lionel Messi — despite playing in their fourth World Cup — only 30. France is perhaps a player away from competing with the world's best teams, and after having won FIFA's Under-20 World Cup last year, it could make that transition soon. This is a great era for the international game, and that makes what Germany accomplished all the more impressive.
Apparently in Russia, it is perfectly legal to transport a bear in the backseat of your sedan—as long as it has a seat belt on. Motorists in the Sverdlovsk Oblast region were shocked when they spotted a car with a bear poking its head out of the backseat, and a video recording of the incident was soon sent to local police. After talking with the driver however, authorities decided not to press charges since it seems that they did nothing wrong.
Be that as it may, the bear looked quite cramped.
As a surprise to almost nobody, professional bear trainers advised against this method of transport.
“If it was more than a year old it wouldn't have fit in such a car and certainly wouldn't have gone inside happily,” Julia Filatova, head of the famous Filatov circus, told the Daily Mail.
Having a large, hairy predator in your backseat could also prove to be a dangerous distraction. In the below video, you can see the driver attempting to placate it by feeding it treats while they're on the road. Unfortunately for him, the bear also decided to munch on their hand a bit too.

Facebook, which today has three times as many employees as when it moved to Menlo Park in 2011, is poised to buy 59 acres next to the office building the company is constructing kitty-corner from its main headquarters.
The social media giant recently reached an agreement with TE Connectivity to purchase the 10-building site at 300 Constitution Ave., Facebook spokesperson Genevieve Grdina confirmed Monday. They would not disclose the purchase price or the company's specific plans for the property.
“The adjacent property we've agreed to purchase is an investment in our future. We have no immediate plans to develop the property,” states a company statement that Grdina provided.
When Facebook first announced in February 2011 that it planned to relocate to the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park, the company had about 2,000 employees worldwide. Now it has 6,800, Facebook's website says. About 4,000 of them work in Menlo Park, according to the city's transportation office. The 57-acre former Sun campus, located at the eastern end of the Willow Road/Bayfront Expressway intersection, can accommodate up to 6,600 employees.
The “West Campus” that Facebook is building on 22 acres across from Bayfront Expressway will be able to handle up to 2,800 employees. Designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, the 435,000-square-foot office building will be crowned with a rooftop park and is expected to be completed by spring 2015.
Facebook's expansion into Menlo Park's eastern side also involves residential development. The company collaborated with developer St. Anton Partners to help design a 394-unit apartment complex that's about a mile away at 3665 Haven Ave. Another developer, Greystar, has applied to build a 146-unit apartment complex next door at 3645 Haven Ave. Those residential projects, plus a seven-building apartment complex with 195 units at 721-881 Hamilton Ave. in the adjacent Belle Haven neighborhood, are expected to be attractive living options for Facebook's young and growing workforce.

Mr. Game 7 may soon be plying their trade elsewhere.
Set to become an unrestricted free agent at season's end, Justin Williams - the 2014 Conn Smythe Trophy winner - said Friday there's been little progress in terms of reaching a new contract with the Los Angeles Kings.
While he's most amenable to staying in California, Williams said their priority remains lifting the Stanley Cup.
Williams told Sportsnet's Hockey Central:
At this point, I love L.A. If I re-sign here, great. I'll be part of a great team moving forward. But if not, I'm going to try to restart my career somewhere else, turn the page and try to win as many hockey games as I can. I'm at a point in my career where it's not all about money, it's about winning for me.
The 33-year-old played a major role in the Kings' recent championships, but recorded only 18 goals and 23 assists in 81 games this past season, which ended with Los Angeles outside the playoff picture.
Still, they may prove to be too costly to retain, giving them an opportunity to boost their reputation as a clutch player somewhere else around the league.
Santa Elena, September 2nd, 2015. (venezuelanalysis.com)- The governor of Venezuela's Tachira state reported that over 50 Venezuelan National Guards (GNB) have been arrested for their alleged rolls in smuggling operations on the Colombian border, while 110 regional police officers have been fired for related activity.
Governor Jose Vielma Mora insisted on Monday that the situation is “binational,” and reiterated their call for the Colombian government to address the situation appropriately by recognizing the level of crime that had become the norm on the shared border until a recent government crackdown.
On August 19 Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro called a state of exception in the border region of Tachira state, in an attempt to combat the smuggling of Venezuelan food and gasoline to Colombia and in acknowledgement of a growing paramilitary presence in the region.
Since that time, 13 alleged paramilitaries have been captured and over a thousand undocumented Colombian citizens have been deported from the area.
Vielma Mora also confirmed that no further Colombians have been deported since the first weekend of the border offensive, when 2000 Venezuelan soldiers raided the makeshift border town La Invasion, a notorious hub of criminal activity.
The move provoked an exaggerated media response as international press portrayed the crackdown as uniquely migration-related, rather than a push against smuggling gangs.
Over 40% of Venezuelan food items and goods were being smuggled across the border, as well as 45,000 barrels of oil daily, according to official data.
The highly profitable contraband business represented a deep source of economic strife and scarcity in the South American nation.
The latest GNB arrests highlight the government's multi-faceted attempt to dismantle the corrupt structures that facilitated the trade.
The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) Secretary-General and former Colombian president Ernesto Samper announced Tuesday a proposal to form a commission to verify and guarantee human rights at the border between Colombia and Venezuela, in response to an analogous request from Maduro.
The EU wants to step up its boat-sinking operation against smugglers in the Mediterranean sea.
Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, said on Thursday (3 September) that the EU's naval operation - EUnavfor Med - is now ready to move from a surveillance-only phase to one that seizes and destroys boats in international waters.
"The intelligence that was gathered throughout phase one highlighted that, on at least 16 occasions in these last five weeks, we could have gone after smugglers and traffickers already", they said.
Mogherini laid out the latest plans at a meeting of EU defence ministers, but noted they still need to be formally adopted.
Foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Friday and Saturday will also discuss the phase two plans.
Military assets from contributing member states will stay out of Libya's territorial waters, Mogherini added.
But they said the transition to phase two would require "more vessels, more assets".
Launched in June, the anti-smuggling flotilla already includes the Italian flagship "Cavour", the British warship "Enterprise", two German warships, in addition to air assets from France, Luxembourg, Italy, and the UK, including two submarines, deployed for their advanced surveillance and detection capabilities.
The third phase will see the EU operation destroy boats "preferably before use" and apprehend traffickers and smugglers.
Moving the operation from the high seas to inside territorial waters is a contentious issue for Libyan and Russian authorities.
The EU needs formal approval from Benghazi or the backing of a UN Security Council resolution. It has received neither.
Libya's internationally-recognised government in Tobruk does not control the coastal area of the country where many of the smugglers disembark.
With Tobruk's mandate set to end in October, Mogherini is hoping the UN can finalise a deal to broker a national unity government with its rival government, a loose alliance of militias, based in Libya's capital Tripoli.
Russia has now indicated it would back a UN resolution that excludes territorial waters.
Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, said the resolution could be adopted within the month.
"We will work within the framework of international law and this is what we are doing and this is what we will continue to do," said Mogherini.
The Republican chairperson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a rare challenge to the Trump administration Thursday: Prove to us that you are making progress with Russia over the war in Syria soon, or we will push forward with sanctions.
Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) has resisted efforts to debate and pass a bipartisan bill codifying existing executive sanctions against Russia for its aggressive actions in Syria and Ukraine and imposing additional sanctions over allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Corker had argued that it was premature to consider such a measure before congressional investigators completed their probe into Russia's activities.
[Senate panel puts Russia sanctions bill on hold]
On Thursday, Corker noted that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had also asked them for “a short window of opportunity . . . to change the trajectory of our relationship with Russia” pertaining to Syria.
But Corker's patience with Tillerson appears to be nearing its end.
“Unless Secretary Tillerson can come in early in this next work session” to tell senators that “these things are occurring that are changing the trajectory” of U.S.-Russian relations, Corker said they would recommend that the committee “quickly” move a bill to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.
Corker did not specify how broad a spectrum of sanctions the committee should pursue, but they said that “likely one of the [bill's] central themes would be Russian interference in our elections.” The Senate will be in recess for the week of Memorial Day and return to Washington in early June.
Corker expressed serious doubts that Tillerson could convincingly argue that anything in the relationship with Russia as it concerns Syria has improved as the Trump administration has promised. Corker noted that they recently reviewed classified documents on the state of affairs between Washington and Moscow, particularly concerning Syria.
“I can just tell you: I see no difference whatsoever,” Corker said. “They continue to work against our interests.”
Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), the committee's ranking Democrat, emphatically endorsed Corker's plan, adding that they hoped the committee would advance the bill “early enough so that it could be considered on the [Senate] floor” during the next work period as well.
“I have no illusions that [Russian officials], in the next couple of weeks, are going to change their behavior,” Cardin said, noting that “I do look forward” to hearing from Tillerson.
The committee approved a bill to improve efforts to counter Russian propaganda and influence-peddling at home and abroad. The legislation was originally a subsection of a broader Russia sanctions bill that Cardin, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and a bipartisan group of senators introduced last month, but Cardin and Corker agreed to strip the sanctions provisions out, over the leaders' dispute about whether Congress should attempt to advance Russia sanctions at all.
Corker's move also prompted Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who was expected to try to force the issue of Russia sanctions back onto the Senate's agenda by introducing amendments that would have revived the punitive measures in the Cardin-McCain bill, to hold back.
Shaheen's amendments would have inserted such language back into the Russian propaganda bill and into a comprehensive bill stiffening sanctions against Iran for its recent ballistic missile tests and the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration is considering labeling as a terrorist organization.
The committee voted on both bills Thursday morning, approving the measure to improve Russian counter-propaganda efforts by a vote of 20 to 1, and the Iran sanctions bill by a vote of 18 to 3.
Though Shaheen withheld their amendments, they warned that “if we continue to fail to act,” it will only bolster Russia and other adversaries to “try to do the same thing to undermine our democracy.”
Corker responded sharply to Shaheen's warning, reminding them that “I keep my word” and that they believed Tillerson would not be able to “demonstrably show that there had been a change.” They added that they had not been in touch with anyone in the White House about the matter, only Tillerson.
Corker also stressed that “a committee that prides itself on diplomacy” ought “to give the new secretary of state a few weeks to see if they can change the trajectory with Syria.”
“That's what I agreed to do,” Corker said, adding: “I don't think they will be able to.”
Committee leaders have yet to hammer out the details of what that Russia sanctions legislation will look like. Corker did not commit on Thursday to take up the exact language in the Cardin-McCain bill, despite bipartisan support for that measure.

PETA has filed a lawsuit against Hot's Kitchen, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging the restaurant on Hermosa Avenue is violating both the foie gras sales ban and the state's unfair competition law, which prohibits businesses from engaging in unlawful business practices.
On July 1, 2012, despite strong opposition from some restaurant owners, California's foie gras ban became operative, prohibiting the sale of foie gras in the entire state.

However, Hot's Kitchen found a way to work around the ban and continue serving foie gras. According to the restaurant's menu, if you buy “THE” Burger, you receive a free side of foie gras.
“The allegation that you can have foie gras for free is as childish as it is illegal,” Matthew Strugar of PETA told NBC Los Angeles. “The only way you can get foie gras is to purchase an eight-dollar burger.”
Hot's Kitchen chef Sean Chaney said in a statement that foie gras can be made humanely, and the restaurant continues to provide customers with wholesome and humane animal products.

Package arrive on time and in good condition, it is not a great quality item but you are buying something on the cheap. For what I paid this was a great deal. WARNING, the nuts on the pistol cross bow are all finger tight. They should all be tightened before use so they do not fall off. I did not notice how loose they were and we lost one. I am sure it will be easily replaced at the hardware but the rest are black to match the pistol crossbow and a replacement will not be. at a distance of 30 feet or so the bolts were sinking almost all the way into a standard foam block archery target, so it has some power. Took two of us to string it, one to bend the staves back and one to loop the string on the end. the screws that hold the sights were loose but did not tighten because they were only sunk into plastic and just stripped out. Over all, I would but another, and it would encourage me to look at more expensive units as well.
I was lucky enough to be invited to the recent Festival of the Fuck Bands, led in a ceremonious fashion by Fucked Up's very own Father Damian. The festival is a chance for bands worldwide to get together, discuss music and politics, and chat about how awesome they are for having the word "fuck" in their band names. The festival took place this past November in — appropriately enough — Fucking, Austria.

Father Damian and their band have been attending the festival, which began in 2000, for the past three years. They explained to me that it is a great way to meet musicians with a similar passion for the word "fuck." Their band led the North American contingency — along with Toronto's Holy Fuck, Portland's Starfucker, and Oakland's Fuck. The three-day festival featured sets from some of the bands, a silent auction to benefit freedom of speech, and seminars on the value of the word "fuck." Mostly, though, the festival served as a perfect environment for the bands to cut loose, be themselves, and, as Father Damian explained to me, "do whatever the fuck they want."

1941 American Home magazine
[The following was written by Mandus E. Bridston, Port Blakely, WA in 1941 and published in American Home magazine. We calculate that it had about 600 sq. ft. on the main floor with another 300-400 upstairs. Does anyone know if it is still standing? Ed.]
At first sight, the summer home of Mr. and Mrs. H. J. Quilliam near Seattle, Wash., is surprisingly like a picture in a child's storybook. Some of the house-for-Goldilocks illusion is due to the fact that the roof of hand-split shakes slopes picturesquely low and there's a unique log wall construction.
It was the owner's own idea to use five and a half cords of cedar logs cut in fifteen-inch lengths and lay up walls with them, installing them endwise. The round, sawed-off ends of the logs provide an irregular, patterned wall surface on both the inside and outside of the house. The blocks are set in mortar and are being allows darkening naturally at each end. They're in varied sizes, some irregularly three or four inches in diameter, others seeming almost as large and perfectly round as a full moon.
The fifteen-inch-thick outside walls provide attractively deep window recesses in the living room as well as usefully deep sills for keeping books, bowls of flowers, sewing baskets, and collections of miniature bottles.
There's an ingenious red brick fireplace here which also serves as a stair to upstairs sleeping rooms, stepping up about the low hearth and provided with a two-inch rubbed cedar rail. The fireplace side of the room is done in knotty cedar boarding, including the door at the head of the stair. Corner supports of the house walls are in brick also for contract and rigidity, along with the uncovered outdoor terrace which extends the full length of the rear of the house and commands a view of sky, sea, and forest. The outdoor fireplace is near by.

Update 2: T-Mobile officially announced the new AppleCare perk.
Update: A T-Mobile spokesperson confirmed to 9to5Mac that AppleCare+ is indeed now included in some Jump and Premium Device Protection plans as detailed in our original story below.
T-Mobile appears to now be including complimentary AppleCare services similar to what's offered with AppleCare+ as part of its Jump upgrade program and Premium Device Protection (PDP) plans. The new support hasn't been announced yet, but an update to the company's webpage was spotted showing that the two premium Jump plans are now listed as including AppleCare services for those who have a new eligible device (via njtechreviews).
The AppleCare services are now offered to customers at no additional cost on the two $12/month plans including T-mobile's own Premium Device Protection service and its premium Jump offering that includes PDP:
The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac
AppleCare Services are now included in our Premium Device Protection offerings at NO additional charge to customers. If you add JUMP! or PDP and have a new eligible iPhone or iPad, you will be able to access AppleCare Services.
While the webpage for Jump only lists “Apple Care Services” opposed to specifically mentioning Apple's premium AppleCare+ service, it does seem to offer the same benefits as the premium offering with service fees from $29 for screen damage and $0 for battery service:
T-Mobile customers who purchase a new iPhone or iPad will enjoy the following benefits of AppleCare Services:
24/7 priority access to AppleCare's award-winning technical support via chat or phone
Low service fees such as $29 for iPhone screen damage
$0 for battery service
Apple-certified repair or replacement at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers
Hardware service with genuine Apple parts
Software support for iOS, iCloud, and Apple-branded iOS apps
Hardware repairs and service backed by Apple
Included AppleCare+ services were notably seen as a big differentiator for Apple's own iPhone Upgrade Program versus Jump and similar programs from other carriers, so the move could make T-Mobile's program much more attractive for customers trying to decide between them.
Apple normally sells AppleCare+ as an add-on to the complimentary one year of hardware repair coverage and 90 days of AppleCare support it provides with every Apple device. It costs $129.00 to add for a current generation iPhone 7 and 7 Plus or previous generation iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
For immediate Release:
BOSTON, MASS. – Tyson Foods, one of the world's largest meat and poultry producers, dumps more toxic pollution into the nation's waters than any other agribusiness, and produces the most animal manure of five major companies assessed nationwide, a new report said today.
The Environment America Research & Policy Center study documented pollution from Tyson and four other major agriculture conglomerates, responsible for an estimated 44 percent of the pork, chicken, and beef produced in the U.S.
“When most people think of water pollution, they think of industrial pipes spewing toxic chemicals,” said John Rumpler, senior attorney with Environment America and author of the report. “But this report shows how, increasingly, corporations like Tyson are turning farms into factories and ruining our rivers and bays in the process.”
By concentrating thousands of animals on factory farms, corporate agribusinesses create industrial scale pollution with disastrous consequences for waterways across the country.
Agriculture is the probable cause for making more than 145,000 miles of rivers and streams across the country too polluted for swimming, fishing, drinking, or maintaining healthy wildlife, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Based on available livestock production data, today's report calculates that Tyson's supply chain alone generates more than 55 million tons of manure per year -- manure that too often ends up untreated, ultimately fouling rivers, streams, and drinking water.
One example cited in the report: When chicken manure contaminated two sources of drinking water for Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tyson and other poultry processors agreed to pay the city $7.5 million.
Gabby Cammarata, a Salisbury, Maryland resident who joined Environment America on a call with reporters to discuss the study, is worried a proposed Tyson facility near their home could cause similar problems for their community's drinking water supply.
The 3.1 million chicken factory farm “would be placed right on top of the underground aquifer which supplies all of the drinking water to the city of Salisbury and the town of Delmar,” Cammarata said. “There's a real risk that manure could enter into our water table and ultimately our aquifer. Like most rural communities, our drinking water treatment system isn't up to the task of dealing with all that pollution.”
From slaughtering plants run by the company or its subsidiaries, Tyson discharged over 20 million pounds of toxic pollutants to the nation's waters in 2014 --- more by volume than even Exxon Mobil or Dupont -- according to data the company reported to the federal Toxics Release Inventory. Most of the company's toxic discharges are nitrates, which are linked to blue baby syndrome and some forms of cancer.
In Iowa, nitrate pollution from agribusiness operations have so badly polluted the Raccoon River that Des Moines is now suing three counties for failing to stop contamination of its main drinking water source.
In addition to those of Tyson Foods, Environment America examined pollution records for:
the Brazilian meat giant JBS, with over 45.8 million tons of manure and over 37 million pounds of toxic pollutants over a five-year period;
Minnesota-based private company Cargill, a major cattle producer, with 39 million tons of manure annually and over 50 million pounds of toxic pollutants over a five-year period;
Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods, based in Virginia, which claims to be the world's largest hog producer, with over 18.9 million tons of manure and 27 million pounds of toxic pollutants over five years; and
the chicken-producer Perdue Farms, based in Maryland with over 3.7 million tons of manure and 27 million pounds of toxic pollutants over five years.
The Socially Responsible Agricultural Project (SRAP), who joined Environment America to release the report, said the solutions to curb agribusiness pollution -- such as buffer zones, reduced concentration of livestock, and hauling waste out of endangered watersheds -- are feasible and well-known to the industry.
“I raise my cows on rotational pasture to help keep our waterways clean,” said Terry Spence, a Missouri farmer who consults with SRAP. “Companies like Tyson should do the same.”
“These corporate agribusinesses have the knowhow and the resources to implement better, more sustainable ways of producing America's food,” concluded Rumpler. “It's time to hold them accountable for their pollution of our environment – just as Americans a generation ago did with industrial polluters.”
When I was 17, I told a group of middle schoolers that my favorite movie was Casablanca. One girl wrinkled their nose and said, “Isn't that movie from, like, the 1940s?”
“Hey,” I said, lightheartedly, “old movies are awesome.”
“Yeah,” a boy added. “Old movies are awesome! Like The Nightmare Before Christmas!”
Not a lot of people show their kids old movies. There's a misconception that old movies are too boring or too hard to understand, and therefore kids won't enjoy them. Well, I grew up watching old movies, and, sure, there were plenty I didn't understand until I was an adult, but there were also several that became instantly my favorite movies.
My seven younger siblings all grew up watching old movies too, so I called them up and asked them what their favorite old movie was growing up. These were the answers I got back. I'm giving myself three choices so this can be a top 10 list instead of just a top 8 – although as a child I would have just told my siblings I get three choices because I'm the oldest.
I'm starting from the youngest to the oldest, so this was chosen by Brother #4, who is now 13. This was the first Alfred Hitchcock movie a lot of us watched, usually around age eight or so, and there's a reason it's especially good for kids. Hitchcock is known as the master of suspense, but To Catch a Thief is more of a light-hearted adventurous mystery. There aren't a lot of scary scenes, and there's plenty of silly dialogue, so even though children may not catch all the wit, they can pick up on the fun characters.
Marx Brothers movies were a staple in our house, but this and Animal Crackers were the two everyone liked the most. Brother #3, who chose this movie, even wanted to have a Marx Brothers-themed birthday party one year. While I don't believe that ever happened, they did frequently invite friends over just to watch these movies. The long wordplay sections tend to get lost on younger viewers, but there is plenty of goofy slapstick to enjoy. Harpo in particular was extremely popular with my siblings, since you can understand everything he's doing without needing to follow their dialogue at all!
Brother #2 picked this zany comedy as their favorite. This one is probably more suited for older kids. It does get very dark and sometimes very complicated, so I wouldn't show this to a five-year-old. But if your child enjoys The Nightmare Before Christmas or other slightly morbid kids' movies, this is a great follow-up, featuring some tremendously funny acting by Cary Grant and Josephine Hull in particular.
I'll admit, I never got into this movie very much as a child. But my mother did, and my sisters did, especially Sister #3, who chose it, and so it was a pretty frequent watch in our house. It's a comedy about a young girl (played by a teenage Shirley Temple) who develops a hopeless crush on their teacher, and their guardian sister's attempt to deal with that crush while they also may be falling for the man herself.
Oh, and that bit from Labyrinth: “You remind of a babe.” “What babe?” “The babe with the power.” “What power?” That's from this movie first, except it's “man” instead of “babe.” I remember my sisters getting all excited when people would quote it, thinking they had seen this movie, only to get very confused when they continued by singing “Magic Dance.”
Sister #2 snagged up this family favorite which is still in my top 50 to this day. It's Danny Kaye's best film that's not White Christmas (and I actually like this one better). This fantasy story about a timid freedom fighter going undercover as the tyrant king's jester is one of the silliest but most entertaining old movies around, and I've always thought more people should be aware of it. It's got everything a child could ask for: romance, sword fights, songs, and lots and lots of goofy comedy. Just beware that if you do show this to your child, they may quote it for all eternity: “The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle, the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true.”
This movie's in my Flickchart top 10 because not only is it a great kids' movie for Sister #1 to have picked, it's also really delightful as an adult. It actually got a write-up just recently here on the Flickchart blog, as I assigned it to Nathan for their movie challenge. It's a funny, unique story with a ton of great songs. I remember my siblings reenacting the “Make ‘Em Laugh” number for hours—although they never did quite manage to run up the walls and flip back off them.
This was actually the movie that spawned the idea for this post. My family has endless home movies of Brother #1 at age four playing characters from this movie. “I'm Robin Hood, and I'm going to fight Guy Gisbourne!” he'd announce, followed by jumping back and forth, shaking a stick at an invisible opponent. It's one of the great early swashbuckling adventures, with a dashing hero and fantastic fight scenes. More action-minded kids may get antsy to skip the romantic scenes with Maid Marian, but they won't need to wait very long before more adventure happens!
This one was my own choice, as a movie, I vividly remember adoring as a child. Katharine Hepburn is funny, Cary Grant is charming, and the scene of the two of them singing to the leopard on the roof is forever engrained in my childhood memory. Zany comedies are definitely an easy sell to kids, as even when they can't pick up on nuances of the characters or witty zingers, they can still giggle at Hepburn constantly tearing Grant's suit jacket or the two of them chasing a wild animal around the countryside.
While older animated Disney films get a lot of replays, some of the best live action Disney films fall by the wayside. Today, this movie is best remembered for being the movie Flubber was a remake of, but this original is far better, in my opinion. It's a sweet, charming movie about a man who is so busy with their newest invention that they keep forgetting to get married. The characters are likable, and as a kid, I was enthralled with the images of the flying car and the basketball players jumping wildly across the court with flubber on the bottom of their shoes. It's a wonderfully imaginative movie and an easy one for kids to love.
One of the most iconic movies of all time, this is one I watched and liked a lot as a kid, decided I didn't like as a teenager, and developed a newfound appreciation for as an adult. The characters and songs are enough to get kids' attention, not to mention those gorgeous visuals, but there are also some very lovely and moving moments in it that I began connecting to deeply in my 20s. Just keep in mind, if you do show this to young kids, the flying monkeys are pretty terrifying, and while I didn't get nightmares from them, I've known a few people who did.
There are tons of other great older films that can appeal to kids, and these ten only scratch the surface. Use the comments section to chime in with suggestions for classic movies you liked as a kid, classic movies your kids like now, or classic movies you just suspect kids would probably like!
Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes opted for some rotation. Claudio Pizarro was given the nod ahead of Mario Mandzukic at center forward, Thomas Müller also took a seat on the bench, and Arjen Robben and Javier Martinez played from the beginning on. The Spaniard cost 40 million euros ($50 million), so pressure to deploy them more may have played a role in Heynckes' thinking.
Third-place Frankfurt defended much further up the pitch than most teams dare to versus Bayern, and, in the first 40 minutes, the visitors limited their hosts to only one scoring chance. In fact, as the first half wound down, Frankfurt had twice as many shots on goal.
They pushed their luck too far, though. In minute 44, Bavaria went on the break with Martinez finding Franck Ribery with a pinpoint pass. The Frenchman scored an easy one to give the hosts a halftime advantage.
Frankfurt didn't give up, with Anderson unlucky to hit the crossbar with a close-range header after the break.
Indeed, up until minute 75, it was anybody's match. Then Vadim Demidov was judged to have brought down Bastian Schweinsteiger in the box. The 20-year-old defender David Alaba calmly converted from the spot. It was hard luck for Frankfurt - in the replay, Schweinsteiger appeared to slip on their own.
Bayern didn't care and were happy to book a somewhat fortunate 2-0 win.
"It's very difficult to get into a rhythm when you are playing every three or four days," Ribery acknowledged after the match. "So it was good to get a victory anyway."
The win was Bayern's 10th in 11 games, giving them 30 points in the table - a Bundesliga records at this point in a season.
Schalke struggles past Bremen
In Gelsenkirchen, second-place Schalke were taking on hot-and-cold Werder Bremen. And initially Schalke looked like the squad who lost to flailing Hoffenheim last round and not the team that held Arsenal to a draw in the Champions League.
Schalke versus Bremen was a real tussle
Aaron Hunt put Bremen in front of Schalke after a quarter of an hour with a hard, low shot with their left foot. Jermaine Jones failed to close Hunt down as they gratefully ran their season goal total to six.
It took 50 minutes for Schalke to create a decent chance, but it yielded a goal. Christian Fuchs put in a free kick for Roman Neustädter, just nominated for the German national team, to head home.
In minute 69, Schalke took the lead. Jones made up for their earlier mistaken by finding 19-year-old Julian Draxler on the break.
Led by the rampant Draxler, Schalke pressed for a decider but couldn't find it and were in danger of conceding a late equalizer. Holtby cleared a last-second header off the line that Bremen thought was in. The referee didn't agree, and Schalke escaped with a narrow 2-1 victory.
Dortmund dismiss Augsburg
Lewandowski bagged a brace for Dortmund
On paper, Dortmund had a far easier challenge, facing the league's worst team in Augsburg. And it only took seven minutes for Marco Reus to put their side ahead with a curling free kick.
It was a marvelous display of skill, but the defending champs were strangely listless. Their only other clear scoring chance came in the dying seconds, when Mario Götze hit the post.
After the restart, Dortmund doubled their advantage in curious fashion. A long pass from keeper Roman Weidenfeller befuddled the Augsburg defense. Robert Lewandowski, who's rumored to want to leave at the end of the season, bundled the ball over the line.
It was nowhere near vintage Dortmund, but Augsburg looked hapless, and Lewandowski put the game beyond reach with a tap-in 20 minutes from time. Sascha Mölders got a consolation goal for Augsburg. The final score: 3-1.
Elsewhere Harry Kruse put Düsseldorf in the lead versus Hoffenheim in minute five. It was the first time that Fortuna led at home this season. And they held it for more than half an hour before Joselu headed in a cross to level the score for Hoffenheim.
The second half also started badly for Hoffenheim when Marvin Compper was sent off. But the visitors were able to batten down the hatches and hold on for the 1-1 draw.
There was a sending off in Freiburg as well, as Hamburg's Paul Scharner saw red for multiple fouls in minute 35. Yet despite being a man up for more than an hour, Freiburg mustered little offensive pressure, and the match ended goalless.
On Friday, Mainz got back on track with a 2-1 win over Nuremberg.
Sunday features three matches: Wolfsburg versus Leverkusen, Stuttgart versus Hanover and Greuther Fürth versus Mönchengladbach.
DJ Campbell scored on their Millwall debut to gain a draw against Sheffield Wednesday, in a feisty match which ended with both sides having 10 men.
The deadlock was broken between the Championship strugglers when Giles Coke dribbled through the Lions defence.
Campbell levelled with 10 minutes left as the Blackburn loanee followed in after Warren Feeney hit the post.
Coke and Shane Lowry were both sent off for fighting soon after, with neither side then able to force a winner.
Hardy travellers Sheffield Wednesday are now unbeaten in their past seven away games in all competitions
Wednesday came into the match boosted by the decision to name Stuart Gray as permanent head coach after a run of four wins and three draws had moved them two points clear of the relegation zone.
Millwall, in contrast, had celebrated their first win in eight matches when they were last in action on 18 January against Ipswich.
Despite the visitors' superior form, Millwall should have gone ahead in only the third minute but Lee Martin could not get their shot away after being slipped in by Andy Keogh. A weak Danny Shittu header and sharp save from Steve Morison followed as the hosts excelled in the first half without forcing the breakthrough.
Ian Holloway's side continued to dominate after the break, but went behind against the run of play shortly before the hour mark when substitute Coke made an excellent run which finished with them rounding goalkeeper Stephen Bywater to score into an open goal.
Wednesday went close to an unlikely second soon after as Miguel Llera headed against the crossbar.
Millwall's overall superiority was rewarded as Campbell equalised late on, in a move which saw referee Lee Probert allow play to continue with Morison down clutching their head in the six-yard box.
Probert came to the fore again minutes later when Coke and Lowry were dismissed for a scrap by the corner flag, in a heated incident which saw both sets of players rush in to separate the pair.
Eight minutes of injury followed, but after Kirkland blocked another Campbell effort with their chest well out of their area neither side could secure all three points.
Millwall manager Ian Holloway:
"I saw a little bit of nervousness which is understandable because of what has happened this season.
"I saw a lack of understanding which comes from the team structure and team mentality and because they played with a different shape to what they have in the last four or five games.
"Unfortunately the way things are going we went one down but I was delighted because the spirit we have been talking about came, the togetherness came and we got excited about what we were doing."
Sheffield Wednesday boss Stuart Gray:

"You go 1-0 up at a difficult place, Ian's second home game and they are working their socks off and the crowd are responding and the players are responding to him, but we weather the storm.
"It wasn't a smash and grab, we had some decent chances and after Coke goes round their keeper and slots it in I am sat here talking about two points lost really.
"I am disappointed with the goal. Millwall were still in possession so there was no need for them to kick it out but I just felt the lad was interfering with Kirkland."
Louisiana Sandbar Plan Worries Some Scientists
Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images
Louisiana officials are pleading for federal approval to build colossal sandbars outside barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico to protect the state's vast wetlands from the oil spurting from the Deepwater Horizon rig.
Heavy oil started showing up in state wetlands earlier this week, heightening the officials' urgency.
"This is an extremely important component of our own plan to protect our coast from this oil, and this will also help to protect Louisiana from future hurricane surges as well," Gov. Bobby Jindal said.
An 80-Mile Network Of Sandbars
State and local officials want to turn the three chains of barrier islands off their coast into incredibly long sandbars, which together might stretch more than 80 miles. The idea is that the oil would collect behind these walls of sand so cleanup crews could suck it up before it reaches the marshes.
Federal officials are racing to try to answer the many questions raised by this emergency request, which could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. BP would be responsible to pay at least part of the cost, so company officials are hoping a cheaper solution is found before this one gets the OK.
Meanwhile, engineers and scientists are furiously working to make plans and find equipment to dredge sand from coastal areas of the Gulf and send it through systems of 30-inch pipes.

"We need to get this acted on as quickly as possible, because we're going to mobilize the dredges and we're going to have to get the pipeline set up to get the sand out to the islands," says Garret Graves, chairperson of Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority.
Protecting A Critical Estuary
So far, weather and currents have kept most of the oil out of the coastal marshes, but that could change, especially with tropical storm season just around the corner.
Storm surges could send the oil from the Gulf into coastal marshes through an array of tidal passes, such as the Rigolets, which connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain.
That could be disastrous for one of the country's most productive nurseries for seafood, state officials say.
"Over 90 percent of the life in the Gulf of Mexico is dependent upon this estuary at some point of its life for existence, for survival. And so the oil getting into this area, getting into our wetlands, we would be experiencing repercussions for years and years to come, if not decades," Graves says.
Small-Scale Efforts To Plug Holes In Beaches
The state is forging ahead with smaller-scale projects that don't require federal approval, such as one under way at Port Fourchon, a skinny strip of beach 60 miles south of New Orleans, which is the hub of the offshore oil industry.
Sticky globs of oil that look like melted caramels have been showing up by the thousands on the beach there, and National Guard troops have been racing to fill gaps in the beach, which were created by recent hurricanes and let Gulf water through to the fragile marshes beyond.

The Guard troops are using helicopters to drop massive sandbags, backhoes to move giant boulders and supersized dump trucks to unload piles of soil.
"We need to close off these breaches because sand is much easier to clean than marsh," says Chett Chiasson, director of Port Fourchon.
Experts Wary Of Unintended Consequences
Wetlands experts say there would be no fix if oil inundates the fragile marshes. A big rush of oil could kill the plants and turn the marsh into open water.
"You can't pressure-wash oil off of these marshes and these plants. You even go up there and try to do manual cleanup, in many of these systems you're going to cause more damage than just letting it be," says Denise Reed, an environmental science professor at the University of New Orleans.
But a lot depends on how much oil would get to the plants. If only a small amount of oil gets into the marshes, plants can protect themselves, they say. Damaged plants can put up new shoots later in the season or next year, after the oil has been degraded by bacteria in the water.
Reed cautions that government officials should consider possible unintended consequences before they launch such a major effort, because it likely would dramatically change natural systems such as tides, and even experts cannot predict the consequences.
For instance, wide swaths of open water would become narrow passes, which would hasten the speed of water flowing through. That could have all kinds of repercussions.
"There's maybe even a potential to kind of carry the oil in even more forcefully than it might otherwise happen," Reed says.
In the estuary, lots of marine animals regularly move from the wetlands to the open water and back, and it is not clear whether they would be able to tolerate those speedy new currents.
We are gathered here, way far in the future, for the funeral of Jack Handey, the world's oldest man. They died suddenly in bed, according to their wife, Miss France.
No one is really sure how old Jack was, but some think they may have been born as long ago as the twentieth century. They passed away after a long, courageous battle with honky-tonkin' and alley-cattin'.
Even though Jack was incredibly old, they were amazingly healthy right up to the end. They attributed this to performing their funny cowboy dance for friends, relatives, and people waiting for buses. All agreed it was the most hilarious thing they had ever seen, and not at all stupid or annoying.
Jack's death has thrown the whole world into mourning, and not in a fakey, sarcastic way. They were admired by people of all ages and stripes, and by all animals, including zebras. Even monsters liked him. They had their playful side and their serious side, but ninety-nine per cent of the time they had their “normal” side.
They started out life as a baby but worked their way up to an adult. But even when they were a full-grown adult they never forgot that they were a baby. Their philosophy of life was a simple one. “I'm-a no look-a for trouble, because-a trouble, she's-a no good,” they would often say, in their beloved fake Italian accent. They were quick with a laugh, but just as quick to point at what they were laughing at. Children loved him, but not in the way their teen-age niece claimed. They were always thinking of ways of helping people, and was wondering how they might do some of those things when they died.
Jack was an expert in so many fields, it's hard to say what they were best at: the arts, the sciences, or the businesses. If you talked to them at a party, you couldn't tell; they seemed to know it all. They have been compared to Captain James Cook, and not just because they were severely beaten by some Hawaiians, and to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and not just because they liked to be driven around in a jeep.
As hard as it is to believe, they never sold a single painting during their lifetime, or even painted one. Some of the greatest advances in architecture, medicine, and theatre were not opposed by him, and they did little to sabotage them.
Although they lived in Paris, in a mansion famous for its many trapdoors, they were always proud to be an American. However, they were ashamed to be an earthling.
They were fabulously wealthy, but they would pretend to be broke, and often tried to borrow cigarettes and money from people. Little did they know that those who gave them stuff would later be rewarded in their will, with jewels and antigravity helmets. Women who refused to have sex with them are probably wishing that they could turn back the clock and say yes.
Generous even with their organs, they have asked that their eyes be donated to a blind person. Also their glasses. Their skeleton, equipped with a spring that will suddenly propel it to a full standing position, will be used to educate kindergartners.
They have asked that no shrines be built to him. But they pointed out that this did not mean they didn't like Shriners. According to our scientists, with their electronic soul trackers, Jack is in Heaven now. And not just regular Heaven, which any jerk can get into, but special secret Heaven, which even some angels don't know about.
So let us celebrate their death, and not mourn. However, those who appear to be a little too happy will be asked to leave.
Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that a lot of the things Jack said and did seem wrong at the time, but now we realize it wasn't him; it was we who were wrong. Let us hope we don't make the same mistake with their clones.
In closing, it is unfortunate that Jack's friend Don could not be here. However, Don died many years ago, from a horrible fungus.
And now robot Elton John will sing “Candle in the Wind.”♦
After Tuesday's awesomely successful launch of Fedora 21, these Five Things in Fedora This Week covers a few questions that I've been asked a lot, by the press and by users who haven't been following Fedora development closely. I hope this will clear up some of the concerns, and as always I'm happy to discuss further in comments, email, IRC, social media, or in person.
Fedora Server: Is this for crazy people?
This question comes in several forms, but the gist is: Fedora's so fast moving and has such a short lifecycle — are you really encouraging people to put a bleeding-edge distro in the data center? Are you intending to compete with CentOS or RHEL? Do you have to be crazy to run Fedora on a server?
So, first: we do try to be “leading”, not actually getting blood everywhere — but it's a fine line. Take a look at the details of our “First” foundation, which says, (emphasis added): “we provide the latest in stable and robust, useful, and powerful free software”.
Generally, there are three good reasons to run Fedora in a server environment.
First, you want the latest in virtualization, networking, or other-low-level technologies as soon as they're available, and you have the skills to keep them running in production. There are big, serious Fedora deployments in the real world. Those probably won't use the first iteration of Fedora Server out of the box, but the user community forming around it will help give their concerns a meaningful outlet.

There are big, serious Fedora deployments in the real world. Those probably won't use the first iteration of Fedora Server out of the box, but the user community forming around it will help give their concerns a meaningful outlet. Second, Fedora Server is a good place to engage with the distribution development community around new technologies — both that developed specifically as centerpieces, like RoleKit and Cockpit, as well as simply the latest versions of all your infrastructure software. The most successful ideas in Fedora server may end up in RHEL and therefore in future versions of CentOS. If you want to have an impact on what's coming next in our downstreams, get involved in Fedora with feedback or contributions.
— both that developed specifically as centerpieces, like RoleKit and Cockpit, as well as simply the latest versions of all your infrastructure software. The most successful ideas in Fedora server may end up in RHEL and therefore in future versions of CentOS. If you want to have an impact on what's coming next in our downstreams, get involved in Fedora with feedback or contributions. And finally, even if you're not intending to get hands-on in that way, running Fedora in some capacity within your overall enterprise-Linux environment will provide a window into those future technologies. If your sysadmins keep up with Fedora, retraining won't be a huge ordeal. Likewise, if you test on Fedora, you'll be ahead of the game in keeping your software working with changes coming down the open source pipelines.
So are we competing with CentOS and RHEL? No — we're part of a great ecosystem including our downstream siblings. If you need the peace of mind and assurances of commercial support, RHEL is probably for you. If you're self-supporting and building something where you to never worry about what you're building it on, CentOS rocks.
A side question to this is often: does this mean there will be a Fedora LTE? Not now, at least. A longer lifecycle for some components is on the table, but it's a difficult and very expensive proposition. I'd rather spend the effort on making upgrades painless and seamless, so you can keep running with minimal manual intervention, downtime, or risk.
Does Fedora Workstation mean Fedora is abandoning regular users?
The quotes and highlighted features on https://getfedora.org/workstation/ are clearly aimed at software developers, and even the name has a different implication than general Linux desktop. Doesn't Fedora care about everyone else?
This is a three-part answer as well:
First of all, please remember that developers are people too . The target audience needs to browse the web, listen to music, edit documents, create and manipulate images, too. Take a look at the target audience in the Workstation requirements document; in addition to the specific developer examples, there's this statement:
While the developer workstation is the main target of this system and what we try to design this for, we do of course also welcome other users to the Fedora Workstation. In fact, many of the changes and improvements we expect to implement for developers will be equally beneficial to other user segments. For instance our plans around multi-screen handling and improved terminal functionality should also be highly beneficial to a system administrator. Or the work we are doing to provide a high performance graphics workstation would be useful to people who want a Linux gaming PC. Or a student who just wants a system with a productivity suite to write papers will of course get benefit from the fact that we do ship a good productivity suite. We will welcome feedback and requests from all our users and try to accommodate it, as long as it doesn't negatively impact our developer target group and we have people available who have the time and ability to work on the requests. Reading the rest of the document may also help understand what we're going for here, and I also encourage you to read Workstation Working Group member Christian Schaller's blog post from last April, Preparing the ground for the Fedora Workstation.
. The target audience needs to browse the web, listen to music, edit documents, create and manipulate images, too. Take a look at the target audience in the Workstation requirements document; in addition to the specific developer examples, there's this statement: Second, everyone's conception of the perfect solution for the “normal”, “typical”, or “traditional” Fedora desktop user is different. In fact, everyone's idea of normal, typical, and traditional is different . The previous target user definition attempted to include basically all of the possibilities, and in actual practice ended up being too vague to meaningfully guide decisions. There's nothing wrong with that (in fact, see next point…) but this approach isn't growing Fedora. I wrote quite a lot about this last month in 5tFTW: Fedora Workstation and the Target Audience. In short, by working at doing one thing really well, we'll be better able to do all the things — as we grow.
. The previous target user definition attempted to include basically all of the possibilities, and in actual practice ended up being too vague to meaningfully guide decisions.

In short, by working at doing one thing really well, we'll be better able to do all the things — as we grow. And third: does that mean that current Fedora users are left with no place in the project in the meantime? No! There's more to Fedora! Even if the marketing materials don't feel like they're hitting you like a bullseye, you can use Fedora Workstation as a starting point. For many people, even non-developers, it'll be perfect out of the box. For others, some configuration may make it more comfortable — possibly even swapping out packages to leave the “Workstation” flavor behind even if sticking with GNOME. For most people used to Fedora's earlier “default offering”, the difference between starting from a generic default and making it a personal desktop is not going to change much from starting from Workstation. (If you feel that Fedora should be about choice, that choice is still there for you to make! But it doesn't stop there! If GNOME isn't your cup of tea, we have some other awesome desktop environment spins put together by our KDE, XFCE, MATE/Compiz, LXDE, and Sugar SIGS. You can download a bootable CD image (also easily put on a USB stick) from a mirror near you: https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/21/Live/x86_64/. And if those don't suit you either, it's easy to get involved and create your own spin. I know this is a little scary, but: if you're a Fedora contributor who sometimes (or often?) feels like decisions made for the default desktop don't fit your own needs, this is a good thing. The Fedora.next concept at work here means that the Workstation WG can make decisions for that target audience without making them the defaults for everyone, and other groups can make sure they have the Fedora that's right for their needs (and the needs of their users).
What about KDE, XFCE, and ARM?
These things don't seem to be mentioned on the http://getfedora.org page at all. Is Fedora getting rid of them?
In two words: no! For desktop environments, this continues where the previous question left off. The Fedora Workstation/Cloud/Server aspect of Fedora.next addresses something different from the question of desktop environments, and the new Get Fedora site reflects that. Fedora Workstation is based around GNOME, but the effort is intended to be much more than a showcase of upstream software.
We did drop the multi-desktop DVD — there just weren't enough hands interested in making it work. And that's really the key: as long as people are interested, willing, and available to work on everything that needs to be done, the added complication is worth it, and the project collectively will support it. And this isn't just talk: improving the http://spins.fedoraproject.org/ website is at the top of our web team's priority list. We also want to find a way to more prominently show stand-out spins like KDE, where a very active community works on building and testing.
The story is similar with ARM: this is an important new architecture, and the ARM team in Fedora is doing awesome things. Fedora is, in fact, the best distribution to run on the hardware we support. Unfortunately, without mainstream cloud providers offering ARM, with open source graphics support in early stages for the desktop, and server hardware just starting to ship, it doesn't yet fit into our Cloud/Workstation/Server story. But I'm sure it will — look for more in upcoming Fedora releases, and on the Fedora ARM wiki right now.
How do I get a desktop on Fedora Server?
Fedora Server is intended to run headless in the server room, with the web based Cockpit server manager serving as a remote UI (perhaps from the comfort of your Fedora Workstation desktop).
However, sometimes you need a GUI. In that case,
sudo yum groupinstall @xfce @base-x
should do it — substitute your desktop environment of choice. You can also, of course, run VNC to provide a remote desktop; sometimes unavoidable when dealing with proprietary storage management interfaces and the like.
Where's the non-server network install?
If you're installing a lab of desktop machines, where do you turn? There seems to only be a Server netinstall image.
We had the intention of making a Workstation netinstall, but because of… boring technical complications and tomfoolery, we weren't able to get it done without delaying the release. However, despite its branding and skinning, the Server netinstall is actually completely generic (other than defaulting to installing Server). So, get that from the mirrors, and point it at the tree (you could mirror that onto your own NFS or HTTP server), and install anything you want.
For Fedora 22, we do plan to produce a separate generic netinstall, as well as a Workstation-specific one; sorry for the confusion this time around.
Bonus Thanks
Thanks again to the Fedora contributor community — you've worked very hard on this release and it shows. And thanks to the wider Fedora userbase for being awesome all around.

Terry McAuliffe (D) to an FBI official's wife "deeply disturbing," an aide said in a statement Monday.

“Last night's revelation that close Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe authorized $675,000 to the wife of a top official at the FBI, who conveniently was promoted to deputy director, and helped oversee the investigation into Clinton's secret server is deeply disturbing and calls into question the entire investigation," senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement.
"The fact that this was allowed to occur shows either outright negligent behavior by the FBI or a level of corruption that is beyond belief. The FBI needs to fully address these issues as soon as possible.”
The report , published Sunday in The Wall Street Journal, said the Virginia governor's political action committee gave nearly $500,000 to the 2015 Senate campaign of Jill McCabe.
Jill McCabe is married to Andrew McCabe, who now serves as the deputy director of the FBI.
Andrew McCabe later helped to oversee the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while serving as secretary of State, according to the publication.
The report also says the Virginia Democratic Party raised $207,788 for Jill McCabe's campaign through mailers.
McCabe lost the election to Republican Dick Black.
"Any insinuation that their support was tied to anything other than their desire to elect candidates who would help pass their agenda is ridiculous.” "[McAuliffe] supported Jill McCabe because they believed they would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors," a spokesperson for the governor told The Wall Street Journal.
The Republican nominee tweeted about the report late Sunday night.
A new poll of Utah voters shows an independent voter few people outside of the state have heard of is in a statistical tie with the pair.
The company called Y2 Analytics conducted a statewide poll of 500 likely Utah voters on Oct. 10-11.
It found support for Democrat Hillary Clinton at 26%, Republican Donald Trump at 26% and Independent Evan McMullin at 22% of likely voters. Libertarian Gary Johnson garnered 14% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein had 1%.
An additional 3% of voters named another candidate, while 7% still claim to be undecided. The margin of error in the poll was listed at 4.4 percent, leading to the statistical three-way tie.
The dramatic shift in presidential preference in a traditionally Republican state occurs on the heels the release of the video with Donald Trump bragging about groping and kissing women. Following the release of the video a host of Utah Republican officials abandoned Trump, some calling on them to drop out of the presidential campaign.
McMullin only entered the race two months ago saying that people had lost faith in the candidates of both major parties.
 They are a practicing Mormon and graduated from Brigham Young University and also has a Masters of Business Administration from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. They have also served in the CIA. They went on to be the chief policy director for the House Republican Conference in Congress.
McMullin's ballot strength is striking considering that only 52% of voters in the poll were aware enough of their candidacy to offer an opinion. However, among those that recognize their name, 4 out of 5 see them favorably.
McMullin is especially popular among Mormon voters who disproportionately identify as Republicans and make up about 60% of Utah's voting population. Among Mormons they are in first place in the ballot with 33% of the vote, leading Trump at 28%.
If McMullin ends up winning Utah, it would be the first time a non-major party candidate would win electoral votes in the United States since 1968.
We have poured over the known free agents-to-be but there are a crop of free agents that could very well become available even before free agency hits. Those are the players who are cut. In most cases those cuts are made prior to the start of free agency so as to clear up cap room.
Here are the players on offense who could become available that the Raiders should be watching for:
Matt Schaub QB Texans ($4 mil savings) - The Texans have moved on from Schaub and are ready to start anew. Their release is forthcoming. A change of scenery might do them good.
Chris Johnson RB Titans ($6 mil saving) -  They are still a pretty good NFL back although they no longer is worth their huge contract. Could be ideal change of pace back alongside Rashad Jennings.
Harvey Dahl G Rams ($4 mil savings) - Rams restructured their deal last year and now must consider cutting them before they are due a $2 million roster bonus.
Gabe Carimi G Bears - Carimi was already released, actually. The former first round pick is considered a bust as a tackle but played pretty well at guard. Definitely worth a look.
David Stewart RT Titans ($6.4 mil savings) - The Titans could use the $6.4 million in cap savings by cutting him. Stewart would be a hot commodity as a starting right tackle.
Eddie Royal WR Chargers ($4.5 mil savings) - In the last year of a 3-year deal which sees their salary jump to $4.5 million, which is too much for their services. They would be upgrade from Jacoby Ford.
Marcedes Lewis TE Jaguars ($5.45 mil savings) - A good tight end with the contract of an elite tight end. The California native could be cut and return to the Best Coast.
Zach Miller TE Seahawks ($5 mil savings) - The Raiders former leading receiver has their Super Bowl ring. They haven't had the production expected though, and is set to get a $1 mil roster bonus on top of their already high price tag of $4.8 million.

Video games aren't intrinsically a masculine hobby. There's a prevalence of masculinity in the gaming community because of how games have been made/pushed and how gaming ads have been targeted for the last thirty-something years , but there's nothing inherently masculine about the concept of video games.
Women making games fights that prevalence. More women making games means a greater share of gaming-zeitgeist exists with women in mind, with what women want to do and see and create. For women and girls who like to play video games but don't like to be inundated with all the masculinity in the community (much of which is toxic), it's absolutely valuable for more women to be involved in making them. More than valuable, it's necessary.
Games are quickly becoming a big part of our broader culture. They can do everything from being art or stories people enjoy, create social commentary, inspire people, bring people together or even give differently abled people or those with mental illness an escape or a way to connect with others they might not have the opportunity to do otherwise. Going in to game development is far from selfish or for self enjoyment: it's a way to create enjoyment, and even unthought of applications, for others.
Big or small there is more than one way for one to make a difference and change the world. In fact, I believe the more “average” aspirations we have from women in tech, the closer we are to true equality in the industry. If all you hear about are the women who purify water with a straw or save the planet, people can still see these women as “special” and “not the norm” so of course it's okay for them to go into tech. But people might not see the average women as suitable for tech. That is not to say you, nor game designers/developers are “just average” or not amazing! Gaming is awesome and important.
Sombra from Overwatch
Artistic media like games has so much effect on the world. When games are done well they can inspire and uplift people, get them to think, bring people together, or even just have some fun. And fun is just as valuable as trying to save the world. I'm passionate about this because not only is it a fantastic way of combing art and tech, I believe I'm helping people by adding a new perspective to an already male dominated field, so that little girls and women don't have to put up with hyper sexualized female avatars, and have games revolving around a female protagonists like Horizon Zero Dawn. No matter what tech should be enjoyable, and knowing how many women play video games I'm confident that there are plenty of people women could help as game developers.
Pursue your interests. Pursue what fulfills you, whether that is game development, or something else. You choose what makes you happy and gives you purpose. While you're at it be as feminine and flamboyant as you would like to be while doing it. You are helping to change people's ideas of what a programmer/gamer/game developer looks like. You are redefining what role models look like and making the world a more awesome place by being yourself.
I don't live in Philadelphia, or the Philadelphia area, so I don't get CSNPhilly. And that means I wasn't able to watch the opening day video montage CSNPhilly put together to celebrate the Phillies starting their season.
Well, "celebrate" may be too strong of a word. Because their montage is about the past. You know what kind of past. The kind that makes us yearn for the future.
I'm not crying, YOURE crying. Great open from CSN pic.twitter.com/XQ1Pg5dErs — John Barchard (@JohnBarchard) April 3, 2017
WHAT THE HELL, CSNPHILLY?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?
I mean, good Lord. That is one emotionally manipulative video. Let's start from the beginning here. (But first, let's thank excellent gentleman and scholar John Barchard for capturing and posting that clip for all of us to enjoy. Thanks, John!) It opens with the legendary clip, the one that we all have stored in our brains in case we need a pick-me-up, the last out of the 2008 World Series. There's Brad and Shane and Ryan and Chase and Chooch and Jimmy and Harry and the whole gang. If you needed a reminder that it actually happened, there it is.
And then Tom McCarthy starts talking. They say:
"Some memories will never be forgotten. But the pieces that contributed, delivered, and punctuated the celebrations are removed from the puzzle at one point or another."
That should be your first warning that this is going to tear you apart.
They show Pat Burrell at the World Series parade, and then they remove them from the image. Like they were never there!
"All parades come to an end" is what Tom McCarthy says, and you know what, Tom? Maybe now's not the time, since you're removing the celebrated stars of the recent past from these indelible images.
Next up is Brad Lidge, who's in the position we remember best: kneeling on the field after that final strikeout, arms raised to the heavens. They were all of us in that moment.
Only he's suddenly not, because CSNPhilly ghosted them out of the picture! Stop that!
It's only gonna get worse. Cole Hamels is holding their World Series MVP trophy, beaming in their WS Champion t-shirt and hat. AND THEN They Get BLURRY, FADES, AND IS GONE FOREVER.
Carlos Ruiz is running out to greet Lidge after the final Game 5 strikeout, they freeze the video, and POOF. They were never there, their ecstatic, smiling face but a memory in our rapidly angering minds.
They show a brief clip of Chase Utley's legendary fake-throw from Game 5 before they transition to them crossing home plate and showing some conquering emotion. And then he's gone again, and is this really happening or is it an acid flashback? Because it's starting to feel like an acid flashback.
Now it's Jimmy Rollins' turn to disappear. They show the hit that made them the franchise leader, and show Mike Schmidt raising Jimmy's fist in the air while Jimmy smiles beatifically.
Until suddenly he's not, and Schmidt is holding nothing up in the air. Nothing but our shattered dreams.
And finally Ryan Howard. They hit a home run, and they slow down their run up the first baseline. Ryan points at the dugout as they run, they freeze the frame, and he's gone.
CSNPhilly decided to have Tom McCarthy narrate a snuff film about the stars of the 2008 World Series. That's what this is.
"The names you cherish have moved on. But the memories and future are still with us."
Like that makes it all better. I want to dig on that sentence, because there's no reason to cram the future in there next to the memories of the Phillies stars of the recent past. But there could be more to that opening montage on CSNPhilly that John didn't capture, and therefore I didn't see it.
Release the whole video, CSNPhilly. I'm going to pray that you showed clips of the stars of the future next, because that would somewhat exonerate you. But until you release the whole clip, you're on notice. I have a pile tear-soaked tissues that you caused, and the next time I'm in Philly I'll be dropping all of them on your doorstep. LOOK UPON WHAT YOUR EVIL HAS WROUGHT!
Freshman Michaela Gordon is no stranger to Taube Family Tennis Center. They played in the qualifying draw of the Bank of the West Classic over the summer and has played and practiced on the courts while growing up in Los Altos Hills and Saratoga.
Gordon defeated sophomore Emily Arbuthnott, 7-5, 6-2, in an all-Stanford singles final on Monday afternoon at the ITA Northwest Regional Championships at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
Michaela Gordon
Gordon was dominant in their collegiate debut, winning all six of their matches in straight sets while surrendering more than three games in any set only twice.
Gordon, who narrowly missed qualifying for the main draw at this summer's Bank of the West Classic, became the first first-year student to win the event since Stanford's Krista Hardebeck in 2012.
It was also the first all-Stanford singles final at the event since 2014, when Carol Zhao defeated Taylor Davidson 7-6 (4), 6-1 in a battle of sophomore teammates.
Stanford has produced the tournament singles champion in seven of the last eight years, with Gordon following previous champions Davidson (2015), Zhao (2014), Kristie Ahn (2013, 2010), Hardebeck (2012) and Nicole Gibbs (2011).
Arbuthnott, coming off a 28-4 rookie season, in which they clinched a team-best 10 matches, also enjoyed an impressive tournament run. Three of Arbuthnott's wins came against nationally-ranked opponents, including a 7-6 (6), 6-4 victory over junior teammate Melissa Lord in the semifinals.
Monday's first set represented the only time Gordon was actually tested over the five-day tournament. Gordon trailed 3-1 and 4-3 before securing the final two games of the frame.
Both Gordon and Arbuthnott earned bids to the inaugural Oracle ITA National Fall Championships, slated for Nov. 1-5 in Indian Wells, California. Gordon received automatic qualification as a result of their victory, while Arbuthnott secured a spot as an at-large.
Stanford's Melissa Lord also qualified to advance though they choose not to participate, citing a tough school schedule.
Stanford's superior depth was on display throughout the weekend, highlighted by four Cardinal players reaching the semifinals.
"I like our team," Cardinal coach Lele Forood said. "We have a lot of talented players. Michaela is very receptive in working on their game. They were talented coming in obviously. Competition is always good."
Gordon said their serve was a big focus leading up to the tournament.
Mardi Gras 1956: "Through my father's lens" (Boing Boing Video)
(Watch video: on YouTube, on Dotsub, or download an MP4)
Today's episode of Boing Boing Video features rare and historic film from Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1956. Artist Mar Dore stumbled on a box of slides in their family's home in Texas a few years back, and inside, discovered photographs that their father, John Mizenko, took of the parades back in the era of "Mad Men." That box of slides was like a time capsule, Mar says, and opened a door into history—the history of New Orleans, and of their own family.
I've blogged one of their photographs here on Boing Boing before (you can buy prints now), but in today's Boing Boing Video, we explore the personal story behind them, and we travel back in time through "found" video footage of that same parade.
Below and after the jump, Mar (who, it should be noted, is a member of my family) shares the story behind this video:
My father was born in the small town of Covington, Louisiana in 1921. They were a chemical engineer, inventor and builder, and an amateur radio operator. They worked for major oil companies and we had to move around a lot. They shot the photos you see in this video in 1956 on February 12th and on Mardi Gras Day, February 14th, on the Mid-City route and on Canal Street in front of Miller-Wohls Department Store, which is no longer there. A lot of the New Orleans you see in this video is no longer there.
The film was shot close to where my father was taking photos. I keep looking for their face in the crowds. They discovered that they had lymphoma cancer in 1990. Their work as an engineer at oil companies had exposed them to toxic chemicals for decades, chemicals that caused cancer. It claimed their life in 1991. These photographs celebrate their memory, and even though I've not yet found their face in those crowds, the photographs themselves illustrate the joy they took in capturing the spirit of Mardi Gras and its wonderful celebration of life.
Mar runs an art gallery called Galleria Mar Dore, and they are selling large-format, archival quality prints of these photos.
View a gallery of these photos here. And more about the photographer here. Scans of the original hand-drawn sketches for the costumes you see on the floats are here.

By: Peter Forth Looks like we are having another downdraft in the precious metals sector. In light of the carnage that happened last year it seems that over every little correction looms the spectre of a repeat washout. For those of you who are curious what this downturn has done to Goldbug sentiment, I have prepared a survey where people can vote as to where they think gold will be two months from now. I've also compiled a list of "pros" and "cons"... things that would support gold and things that point to a lower gold price: Reasons for Gold to fall The stockmarket has been climbing without any improving fundamentals long enough to be due for a significant correction and the gold price has followed the DOW down 51% of the time in the last half of 2009 (gold stocks followed the DOW down 71% of the time). China has indicated that they plan to begin monetary tightening. There is hot money right now in gold that will likely flee now that it has stopped going up. The dollar carry trade could unwind, removing many gold hedge fund positions. If the government is unable to print more money than is being lost in the economy due to loan payoffs, defaults and decreased money velocity then our economy will tilt again towards deflation. Even if you believe that the government will eventually be successful in creating enough inflation, it is not impossible that they fall behind the curve for a while if things start to happen quickly, resulting in a temporary loss in gold prices. JP Morgan and the other big banks seem to be able to create nearly infinite amount of short positions to keep the price down and the political will to stop that seems to be largely absent. The amount of paper gold substitutes such as GLD is arguably much greater that the actual amount of real gold available, causing dilution of the investment demand in the same way as when a company issues a large new set of shares. Gold is under a downward sloping trendline and well under its 50 day moving average. Gold stocks (GDX) are under a downward sloping trendline, well under its 100 day moving average and is now lower than its December 2009 lows. Dehedging from gold companies may be almost over now. As we saw in the Fall of 2008, Gold (and certainly not Gold Stocks) do not necessarily benefit and can in fact be substantially harmed by safe haven flows in a panic. Reasons for Gold to rise Central banks around the world continue to print money without end in their attempt to keep the financial system solvent. For example in December alone, Freddy and Fanny were given an infinite checkbook by the government. None of the excess that caused the financial crisis appear to have been solved: Banks are still massively overleveraged.
Banks know that if they take on risk they will be bailed out, so they are still taking on huge risks.
Unemployment is still skyhigh with no indication as to where any new jobs might come from to bring it down again.
The is a huge overhang of homes that are technically in default but that are being held out of the market by the banks.
Alt-A loans and Options ARMS are resetting this year and they are bigger than subprime. The government will be unable to substantially raise interest rates for the forseable future, leaving us in a net negative interest rate environment. Companies that hold huge short positions risk a default if counterparties demand physical delivery of their metal. There are some indications that this could occur in 2010 (in fact there are some rumours of this occurring already right now, with huge premiums being offered in return for cash settlement). Central bank selling has turned into net central bank buying. Many large gold companies have cleared large portions of their hedge book, indicating that they expect higher gold prices. Contrarian investing disagrees with most of the articles in the mainstream media say gold is overvalued and going to fall. Gold may be in the process of forming a double bottom at 1075. What do you think? Are goldbugs on the launchpad for the moonshot or are we doomed to another thrashing ala 2008?

First Lady Michelle Obama had delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on their feet tonight with their powerful speech, which got similarly strong reaction on Twitter. President Barack Obama was joined by a string of Hollywood stars in heaping praise on the eloquent address that made the case for Hillary Clinton becoming the next President of the United States while taking subtle jabs at their Republican opponent, Donald Trump, without mentioning them by name.
Incredible speech by an incredible woman. Couldn't be more proud & our country has been blessed to have them as FLOTUS. I love you, Michelle. — President Obama (@POTUS) July 26, 2016
Many opted to quote some of the inspirational lines in Michelle Obama's speech, which became instant soundbites.
“Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great…because this right now is the greatest country on earth” – @MichelleObama — Dulé Hill (@DuleHill) July 26, 2016
“When Hillary didn't win the nomination 8 years ago, they didn't get angry or disillusioned.” You gon' speak the truth on tonight @Flotus! — yvette nicole brown (@YNB) July 26, 2016
“Because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters…can take it for granted that a woman can be president.” —@FLOTUS pic.twitter.com/bCezjrX9W5
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 26, 2016
Many responded to the emotion and personal elements in the speech, in which Michelle Obama spoke about raising their children in the White House, noting that the upcoming Presidential election is not about left or right, Republican or Democrat, but instead, it's about “who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives.”

Garmin Edge 1030 released as an upgrade to the Edge 1000
The Garmin Edge 1030 has been released after much speculation and leaks over the last few years and the big question on everyone's lips is the device really worth the money to upgrade. At £499 / $599 it's a big ask if you already have an Edge 1000 or an 810 that works well. Garmin has released 2 variants of the Edge 1030, one being a standard edition that includes the Edge 1030, charging cable and various mounts and the second being the performance bundle which includes all of the above, but including a Heart rate monitor and Cadence sensor. The big surprise to me is that with the performance bundle you don't get the battery pack which is an optional extra with both additions.
Hot Deal Garmin Edge 1030, 3.5" GPS Cycling/Bike Computer with Navigation and... 3.5" bike computer with comprehensive navigation, performance and cycling Awareness Features. 3rd-party app access: via Connect IQ, including preloaded Strava and Training Peaks
Trend line popularity routing uses billions of miles of Garmin Connect ride data to show the best on- and off-road routes
Check out the review: Garmin Vivosmart 3 review
Garmin Edge 1030 top 7 features
As with any new device, it will come with some new features to tempt consumers to upgrade and the big question is, are these features enough to push you to upgrade to the Garmin Edge 1030. I will discuss the top 5 features in my view and I will also give an opinion if this feature will be rolled out to other Edge devices.
Garmin Edge 1030 battery life
Garmin promises a 20-hour battery life and this is a great upgrade from the Edge 1000 and will interest those that are into long distance cycling. You can also expand the battery performance by using an external battery (sold separately). I want to point out I have never had an issue with my Garmin Edge 1000 with battery performance, but the longest distances I have done is about 100km so for some it maybe a problem
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
Simply put… no, it won't. But I have an inexpensive solution in the form of an Anker charging bank and a USB cable. I have used this many times with the Garmin Virb and managed to keep it running for over 3 hours when out riding.
Garmin Edge 1030 connectivity
The Garmin Edge comes with the normal ANT+ connectivity which allows you to connect to a whole host of ANT+ enabled devices and if you have already invested heavily in the Garmin sensor range so this will be welcome news, but no surprise of course. The biggest change here is the addition of Smart Bluetooth connectivity and this will allow you to connect other Smart Bluetooth sensors
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
No it won't I don't think for Smart Bluetooth, but I don't think you are missing much unless you have a sensor that is smart Bluetooth, but given most decent sensors are ANT+ it's not a massive improvement.
Garmin Edge 1030 TRENDLINE popularity routing
Garmin has launched a new feature with the Edge 1030 and they are calling this TRENDLINE popularity routing. The claim made by Garmin is that the data to power this new feature is based on billions of user riders and will give you a route based on optimal data and real world user information. Whilst you will not see much difference between the Edge 1000 and the Edge 1030 as it's a data driven feature you might not appreciate the routing capabilities.
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
I think not, this will be a USP for the Edge 1030 and if it did it would not be for some time and only the Edge 820
Essential reading: Garmin Vivosmart 3 review
Garmin Edge 1030 comes with Preloaded apps from Strava, TrainingPeaks
While the Edge 520 and 820 can use Strava Segments for real-time tracking of your performance versus your PR, your friend's PR or the KOM/QOM, the Edge 1030 adds the latest Strava Routes Connect IQ app that lets you download routes you have on Strava and navigate them. This is a really useful feature and the turn by turn navigation works with them also, so this will mean no more downloading Strava routes and importing them into Garmin. The other thing I really like is the ability for the device to pull Strava live segments whilst you are out riding and this is done via your smartphone if you have taken it with you. Just one point to note that these features require a Strava premium subscription.
The TrainingPeaks CIQ app automatically loads each day's workout onto the computer if you are a TrainingPeaks subscriber following a training plan. This is handy if you are religiously following the plan, but you can't jump ahead or back to other workouts; only that day's workout shows up. This is a useful app, however, I am more excited about the Strava app updates
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
Both the Strava and TrainingPeaks apps are available for Edge 820, 520 and 1000 right now to download.
Garmin Edge 1030 rider to rider messaging
The Garmin Edge 1030 will also feature rider to rider messaging and this will work by pairing a smartphone. It will not allow you to write messages, but it will allow you to send pre written messages to other riders who have a Edge 1030. I would have thought that Garmin would have allowed you to edit the pre written messages or even send messages with your location and estimated ETA. I am sure this will come with an upgrade in the future, but it's a very good start
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
Whilst I have doubts it will, I do think Garmin will need to roll this out (if they can) to other devices in order for this feature to have a chance of taking off.
Garmin Edge 1030 advance performance features
Just like the Garmin Fenix 5 series, the Garmin Edge 1030 will also include advanced performance data in the form of training load and training status. This will cover key areas like VO2 max, training load, recovery time and when pair with other Garmin products such as the vector 2 or the new vector 3 pedals this device will really be a great device for training and gaining meaningful training insights. However one of my biggest bug bears is that Garmin doesn't link the data across devices that support this such as the Fenix 5 and the Edge 1030.
Essential reading: Garmin Vector 3 pedals released
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
Garmin launched this feature with the Fenix 5 series this year and have been promising a roll out to Fenix 3 HR devices and it has not happened yet. I doubt it will be rolled out to other Edge devices and if it does then I suspect the Edge 520 and 820 will only benefit.
Garmin Edge 1030 cycling safety features
Garmin has been steadily moving in the direction of cycling safety for a while now with the Varia series that includes the Varia radar light which I personally use all the time. Garmin has now included incident detection which is included in a number of other Edge devices. The incident detection will detect if you have come off the bike and will alert a preset contact of this incident which will include the recorded location, this feature does need an active Smartphone data connection to work.
Will this feature arrive on other Edge devices?
Well, you already get integration for Varia with the Edge 520, 820 and 1000 and incident detection on the Edge 520 and 820 and the 1000 explorer. So whilst I am saying this is one of my top 6 features as I am all for cycling safety, you already get this on a number of devices.
Essential reading: Garmin Fenix 5x review
Is the Garmin Edge worth the money
Looking at the Garmin Edge 1030 features that have been launched with it, I am not sure it is a worthy upgrade over the Edge 1000 or if you already own a 820. I am very interested how testing this new device pans out and I am going to really give the battery life and other features more testing, but if you are looking at a Garmin Edge device then, other options like the Edge 820 or the Edge 1000 which has been reduced in price is a good alternative.

One out of every nine people in the world does not have enough food to eat.
An annual report from the United Nations released Tuesday estimates that 805 million people suffer from "chronic undernourishment."
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization warned that "food-insecurity" remains "unacceptably high" in certain developing economies.
For example, more than one in four people in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have enough to eat. In Malawi, half of all children under five years of age are significantly underweight.
The situation is particularly acute in Yemen, where political and economic instability, as well as violent conflict, have made the Arab nation one of the most food insecure countries in the world.
The report says 526 million people in Asia, the world's most populous region, don't have enough to eat.

Still overall, there has been improvement from last year, when the report showed that about 842 million people went hungry. Since 1990, the number of undernourished people in the world has decreased by more than 200 million.
Access to food has improved in certain parts of East Asia and South Asia, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean.
Indonesia has reduced the share of its population living in hunger by more than half since 1990, the report states. The report singles out Brazil, Bolivia and Haiti as "case studies" for improving food security.
Developing nations are close to achieving their goal of halving the number of hungry people by 2015, the report suggests, but only if world leaders stick to their commitments.
"This is proof that we can win the war against hunger and should inspire countries to move forward, with the assistance of the international community as needed," the report states.
The report comes ahead of a key summit on food security next month in Rome.
This weekend Japan's iconic rail network launched the newest addition to its system of shinkansen "bullet trains," connecting Tokyo for the first time by high-speed rail with the northern island of Hokkaido. The new Hokkaido Shinkansen travels the 825 km (513 miles) from Tokyo to near Hakodate, Hokkaido's southern port city, in just over four hours. It's another approximately 20 minutes by a connector train into Hakodate proper.
This shaves almost an hour off the previous train travel time; trains ride at speeds up to about 260km per hour (160 miles per hour). Travel times would be shorter were it not for speed restrictions in the tunnel under the strait between Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan's main island.
The futuristic, needle-nosed 10-car trains can seat up to 731 passengers in three classes of service. Interior design is inspired by Hokkaido's natural beauty - snowflakes, bays, etc. - and the art of its native Ainu people.
The one-way fare between Tokyo and Hakodate is between JPY22,810 for a regular reserved seat and JPY38,600 for first class, called Gran Class (about $201-340). For comparison, plane flight between Tokyo and Hakodate cost about JPY27,400 to JPY42,700 ($242-377), plus transfers, and get you there about 40 minutes faster, after allowing time for check-in, security and travel time to and from the city centers.
The Japan Times reports that tickets for the inaugural runs of the Hokkaido Shinkansen sold out in 30 seconds. The total construction cost was put at JPY550 billion (about $4.85 billion).
Eventual plans are for the shinkansen to reach Sapporo, Hokkaido's capital and Japan's fifth largest city, by 2030. The long lead time is largely attributed to work boring tunnels through the island's mountains.
As Japan, China and European nations expand their high-speed rail networks exponentially, the U.S. can't seem to get its act together with high-speed rail. A new survey by the transportation search engine GoEuro ranks the U.S. a dismal 19th out of 20 nations in terms of its high speed rail service, behind such countries as Poland and Turkey.
So far the greatest progress in high speed rail in the U.S. has been in California. A Public Policy Institute of California survey found that two-thirds of Californians support high speed rail in the state, but the reality is a long way off. Although construction has begun through central California, under current projections the system won't link San Francisco with Los Angeles and Anaheim until 2029.
Veteran midfielder Michael Brown could be forgiven for looking back on their time at Leeds United and wondering what might have been.
Signed by Simon Grayson in the summer of 2011, the former Premier League player made 75 appearances during a three-year spell that saw three permanent managers, and three different owners of the club.
Having finished seventh in the Championship the season before their arrival, United have flirted with the Play-Off places in every campaign since, but ended with three mid-table finishes.
“There's been ups and downs and a few manager change arounds,” explained Michael, reflecting on their time with the club.
“There's been a few takeovers and everything has always been changing, but I've still enjoyed my time here.
“I would have liked to have played more football, and that lets you play better. When you're in and out you don't get the solidity you would like.
“You look at the crowd of 30,000 last weekend for an end of season game. That could easily turn into 40,000. It just needs the team winning.
“It's a matter of the new chairperson finding what they want for the future and what the club needs for the future and I'm sure it can go in the right direction.”
A 15th placed finish wasn't what United had hoped for when, going into the Christmas period, the Play-Offs looked a realistic possibility. Since Christmas, the team has struggled for form, and off the field issues against came to the fore.
“It's been a very strange season,” said Michael. “I thought I'd seen a lot before, but this has been a first for me. We were right in there at Christmas and then things didn't go as well as we'd have liked.
"The Christmas period hurt us, we didn't cope, and we fell away in January as everyone could see.
“At a club like this you need to be brave and ballsy, but things just weren't meant to be.
“There was a time when you thought we could get dragged in, but the manager picked a few of the senior boys and we won three from five so it was a good finish.
“There are lots and lots of work to be done. I'm sure the chairperson will look for stability and will want that as soon as possible.”
The Hartlepool-born Brown is now one of a number of United players out of contract and has yet to learn whether or not there will be an offer to continue with the club.
“The manager said they aren't sure what will be or whether they want to offer me anything,” they added.
“I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here and I want to keep on playing football. I think I still have a bit to offer.
Ubisoft has shared some details about Far Cry 4 and how it handles on the new consoles, the PS4 and Xbox One, even going so far as to confirm that the game will look like the PC version on Ultra High quality settings.
Far Cry 4 was revealed to the world last month and, at E3 2014 last week, Ubisoft finally presented some gameplay footage with the gorgeous first-person shooter, showing off the stunning visuals, the new environment of Kyrat in the Himalaya mountains, not to mention the various enemies and animals.
As opposed to Far Cry 3, which came out in 2012, Far Cry 4 will debut on the PS4 and Xbox One, besides the PC, PS3, and Xbox 360.
While talking in the latest Major Nelson podcast, Ubisoft's Alex Hutchinson has gone in-depth about the differences between the game's current-gen and last-gen editions.
First up, the creative director said their team wanted Far Cry 4 to play the same on all platforms, but at the same time, it also wants to show off the game's beauty on PC, PS4, or Xbox One.
"We want the gameplay experience to be the same on all platforms so we're leaning on technical differences. Everything you see, whether it's the fur on the animals, the grass on the ground or the leaves on the trees. All these things are bumped up a huge amount in the next gen version," they said.
Hutchinson has also mentioned that Far Cry 4 is developed primarily on PC, unlike other Ubisoft games, i.e. Assassin's Creed. However, on the PS4 and Xbox One, the studio was able to get it running at ultra high quality immediately.
"We develop on PC primarily, which is actually unusual. With Assassin's Creed, we develop on console, so we start at that and we push the boundary of the console as hard as we can. But because we develop on PC, you've never really seen on console the ultra-high PC version before.
"So even out of the box, even day one, we just stuck the code on the new consoles and we were able to dial it all the way up. So as a console player you're already getting by far the best version we can ship."
Far Cry 4 is set to debut this November on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One platforms and you can bet that Ubisoft will show off the game in action until then through videos and screenshots.
[van id=”entertainment/2016/01/15/glenn-frey-eagles-one-song-memorialized-sot-piers.cnn”]
NEW YORK — Glenn Frey, a founding member of the rock band the Eagles, has died at 67, a publicist for the band has confirmed.
“Glenn fought a courageous battle for the past several weeks but, sadly, succumbed to complications from rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis and pneumonia,” reads a post on the band's official website.
Frey had been suffering from intestinal issues, which caused the postponement of the band's inclusion in the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors.
Frey and the other original members of the Eagles — Don Henley, Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon — came together to form singer Linda Ronstadt's backup band in the early 1970s.
They were all experienced musicians who forged a laid-back, country-tinged sound that the Eagles would eventually make famous.
“We are all in a state of shock, disbelief and profound sorrow,” Henley said in a statement Monday. “I'm not sure I believe in fate, but I know that crossing paths with Glenn Lewis Frey in 1970 changed my life forever, and it eventually had an impact on the lives of millions of other people all over the planet.
“It will be very strange going forward in a world without them in it,” Henley added. “But, I will be grateful, every day, that they were in my life. Rest in peace, my brother. You did what you set out to do, and then some.”
Musicians of all stripes, from Carole King to Huey Lewis to Travis Tritt, posted tributes to Frey on Twitter.
Throughout the early- to mid-1970s, Frey and the band released hit after hit, leading a renaissance of mellow California singer-songwriters with such artists as Ronstadt and Jackson Browne.
Frey and Henley co-wrote many of the band's biggest songs, including “Best of My Love,” “Lyin' Eyes,” “One of These Nights” and “Hotel California.” Frey also famously helped Browne finish writing the Eagles' first hit, “Take It Easy,” contributing the catchy verse, “it's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford / slowing down to take a look at me.”
Frey played guitar and keyboard and took lead vocal duties for the band on tunes like “Take it Easy” and “Tequila Sunrise.”
With “Hotel California” in 1976, the band reached the pinnacle of its success, selling 16 million copies. They released four number one albums consecutively between 1975 and 1979: “One of These Nights,” “Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975,” “Hotel California” and “The Long Run.”
“Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975,” was the first album certified platinum and has sold 29 million copies in the United States, second only to Michael Jackson's “Thriller,” according to Rolling Stone.
The Eagles have sold more than 100 million records worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. But while public reception was warm, the band had a prickly relationship with many critics.
“Another thing that interests me about the Eagles is that I hate them,” wrote rock critic Robert Christgau in 1972, when they first hit it big.
The band succumbed to internal squabbles and broke up in 1980. Frey, Henley and other band members were famously contentious.
With their pop sensibilities and gift for melody, Frey was an ideal songwriting counterbalance to Henley's seriousness and penchant for weighty social statements.
“He was like a brother to me,” Henley went on to say Monday. “We were family, and like most families, there was some dysfunction. But, the bond we forged 45 years ago was never broken, even during the 14 years that the Eagles were dissolved.”
Frey saw solo success with the 1982 release “No Fun Aloud.” They hit the top 40 with “The Heat Is On,” “You Belong to the City,” “True Love,” and “Soul Searchin.'”
They also tried their hand at acting with a guest spot on “Miami Vice” and a small role in the 1996 film “Jerry Maguire,” among other credits.
The Eagles reunited for 1994's Hell Freezes Over tour, which spawned an MTV special and a live album. They would continue to tour together over the years.
“Words can neither describe our sorrow, nor our love and respect for all that they have given to us, their family, the music community & millions of fans worldwide,” the band said on its website Monday.

INDIANAPOLIS – The Indiana Pacers announced Friday they have re-signed free agents Roy Hibbert (Photo Gallery ») and George Hill (Photo Gallery »). Per club policy terms of the contracts were not released.
Watch Press Conference Announcing Hill, Hibbert Signings »
"Re-signing Roy and George shows a commitment from Herb Simon to our franchise, our team and our fans that we fully intend to keep this team moving forward in the NBA," said Donnie Walsh, Pacers President of Basketball Operations. "Both of these players were very important to our success last season and to have them locked up for the coming seasons is a great foundation to build off of."
Hibbert, a 2012 NBA All-Star, is coming off their best season with the Pacers, averaging 12.8 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per game. They finished the season ranked fifth in the NBA in blocks per game. Originally drafted by the Toronto Raptors in the 2008 NBA Draft (17th overall pick), they were traded to the Pacers on July 9, 2008 and has spent all four of their seasons in the NBA with the Pacers. They have career averages of 11.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game.
"I'm happy to be back and I have unfinished business here," said Hibbert. "I can't wait for the season to begin."
"As Donnie and I went through this process, it really wasn't a matter of 'if' we would keep Roy and George. We had to keep them," said Pacers General Manager Kevin Pritchard. "When you look at how this team, with the emphasis on team, is constructed, so many parts fit very well. These are two parts who are still young, who are going to get better and who are going to make our team better. Roy and George are also excellent representatives of the franchise and excellent representatives of the community. They are quality players and quality people."
Hill, a native of Indianapolis, played both high school and college basketball locally at Broad Ripple High School and IUPUI. They were drafted by San Antonio as the 24th overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft and spent the first three seasons with the Spurs before returning home to play for the Pacers as part of a draft night trade on June 24, 2011. The 6-2, 180-pound guard has career averages of 9.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.
"I'm happy to be staying home with family, friends and my AAU program," said Hill. "The main thing was to keep this team together and keep moving forward. It was always a dream to be with the Pacers and now that it's reality for a longer period of time, it's great."
KUALA LUMPUR (BERNAMA) - The three-month public inspection for the Kuala Lumpur Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project, which began on Wednesday (Nov 1), has garnered more than 400 positive responses on its first day, said Malaysia's MyHSR Corp.
MyHSR Corp, the Malaysian delivery partner for the bilateral project, said in a statement that public inspection commenced with 14 permanent booths at Malaysia's Land Public Transport Commission offices and local councils in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and Johor.
Additionally, a total of 29 roadshow booths would be placed at shopping malls and public places from Nov 15, 2017 to Jan 31, 2018.
Throughout the period, visitors will be able to view materials containing information about the project, including satellite images of the planned 350km alignment and locations of the seven stations within Malaysia.
Other information such as typical station features and layout, land acquisition plans, railway technical data and socio-economic development programme for the HSR hubs would also be available at the booths for visitors viewing and reference, it added.
MyHSR Corp Chief Executive Officer Datuk Mohd Nur Ismal Mohammed Kamal said the three-monh period was crucial in ensuring comprehensive dissemination of project information and effective collection of feedback from the public.
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore signed an agreement last December to build and complete the HSR by 2026.
The railway line's seven stations in Malaysia are Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Seremban, Ayer Keroh, Muar, Batu Pahat and Iskandar Puteri.
The only station in Singapore will be at Jurong East.
Uber is trying to become the largest ride-sharing company in its second-largest market.
After failing to succeed in China, and subsequently selling its business there to Chinese competitor Didi, the company has turned its attention to India and is now attempting to surpass local ride-sharing company Ola Cabs as the market leader.
To spread the word, Uber has unleashed its new “Move Forward” marketing campaign that focuses on both riders and drivers alike. In one ad, “Shankar” is driving around unmoving traffic to get their daughter to school in time to take a test. They then turns on the Uber app and goes to pick up a customer, ending with, “Shankar moves forward. Uber moves Shankar.”
In addition to the new commercials, Uber India is also offering customers the chance to win free uberPOOL rides. The three people who take the most uberPOOL rides between Oct. 10 and Oct. 14 will win a year, a month, or a week worth of free rides.
“The merger with Didi has freed up resources for additional focus on customer experience and technology,” Amit Jain, who runs Uber's operations in India, told Bloomberg. Uber is supposedly spending tens of millions of dollars each month in India, where the ridesharing market is expected to soon reach $10 billion.
While the situation in India is similar to the one it faced in China, in that Uber is going up against a local competitor, Ola has much less funding than Didi did. However, as Ola co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal said in an interview over the summer, “Money is not the thing that wins the market. It is experience.”
Uber was founded in 2009 and entered India in 2013. Ola was founded in 2010, but has more experience in the country and, with Indian-born founders, a deeper understanding of the locals. Considering many potential customers in India don't have smartphones or credit cards, Ola has implemented app-less booking and cash transactions, moves that Uber has followed.
Uber India's growth appears to be fairly rapid. The company is now in 28 Indian cities, and the country accounts for 12% of all Uber rides globally. In August it completed around 5.5 million rides each week, which is triple what it was at the beginning of the year. Uber plans to recruit a million drivers by 2018.
Uber could not immediately be reached for comment.
My Real-World “Yes Man” Experiment
Who says real life isn't like movies…
Have you seen the movie “Yes Man”?
In the movie, Jim Carrey plays a sad lonely bank worker, who sticks within their comfort zones and rejects any novelty. They basically say “no” to everything, and even misses their best friend's engagement party.
Then a friend from their past suddenly turns up, and drags them to a motivational seminar. The seminar's speaker grabs Jim Carrey, shakes them up, forces them to take a good long look at their life, and convinces them to say “Yes!” to every request and opportunity. It leads to… well I won't spoil it for you, in case you haven't seen the movie 😉
So I decided to do my own “Yes Man” experiment. For a week, I would say “Yes!” to every request.
I did it because I thought it would be fun. And I was absolutely right. But it turned out to be a lot more than just fun…
My week of saying “Yes!”
On Monday afternoon, I was working on a presentation with a few fellow math geeks that was due for Tuesday.
Since it was a bank holiday, the maths department was closed. But as we were walking past the entrance, we saw some guys get in with a key. After a moment's hesitation, I decided to say “Yes!” to the opportunity, called after him, and asked them to let us in. After a moment's negotiation, they agreed. (Victory for saying Yes 😀 )
As we stayed there, long into the night, a friend mentioned he'd like to do a Eurotrip in the summer. I think that's a brilliant idea, so we got talking about it, and we might do it together this summer. Yet we probably never would have talked about it if we didn't sneak into the math department and stay there all day.
Of course, Monday was just the beginning. The really crazy stuff started on Tuesday…
…
On Tuesday, I went to a dance show, because some of my breakdancer friends asked me to, and I decided to say “Yes!” to the request. I didn't know what the show was going to be like. It turned out to be a huge 3-hour show of all the dance-related societies at the university, and it was absolutely awesome!
That alone would have been worth saying “Yes!”.
But that's not the end of it. Because I went to the dance show, I met a friend of a friend (whom I've met once before) in the queue. We got chatting and had a fun time at the dance show.
Then, out of the blue, they call me on Thursday morning (I didn't even give them my phone number), asking me if I can come along to a photoshoot. Appranently, a friend of theirs was doing some arts project.
I was feeling tired and lazy that morning, so I automatically said “no”. I put down the phone, and then realized what I had just done. I spent about 10 minutes struggling with myself, torn between facing that I said “no”, and calling them back, looking stupid, and telling them I actually DO have time to do the photoshoot.
In the end, saying “Yes!” won, so I called them back. The photoshoot turned out to be a quick half-hour, and great fun! And I talked to one of the photographers, and they agreed to meet up sometime and do a free photoshoot of me for my blog's new header image. (University life is awesome. There are so many hobbyists willing to do great-quality work for free!)
So coming to a dance show resulted in getting in touch with a photographer for my blog's header image. It's like the scene from Yes Man where Jim Carrey finally makes use of their guitar lessons. Completely, utterly unrelated and unexpected. 2 Cuils.
(Maybe Cuil was ahead of its time, and actually models reality more accurately than any other search engine :p )
…
Another thing happened that was completely insignificant, but quite fun!
I was walking on campus, and a girl tried to hand me some flyer. Per reflex, I just said no and kept walking. After 100 metres, I realized what just happened. I stopped dead in the middle of a frequented walk, and just stood there for about 2 minutes, torn between going back, asking for the flyer, and looking stupid… or breaking my covenant and saying “no”.
So I walked back, said “On second thought, give me one”, grabbed a flyer out of their hand, turned around and walked away. The flyer turned out to be useless to me (advertising some communist seminar in the summer. Unfortunately, I'll be on holiday in a different country at the time), but walking back and asking for it was was tons of fun 😀
…
There was one other completely unexpected way my “Yes Man” experiment affected my life.
I'm on next year's committee for the Enterprise Society, and I was invited to a posh dinner on Thursday with some university officials. At first I was hesitating about going, because Thursday evening was pretty much the only chance I had all week to get some exercise (volleyball training).
But I decided to say “Yes!” to the dinner, and instead get my exercise by jogging every morning.
I've only missed one morning since. Jogging turns out to be surprisingly pleasant! Yet I never would have tried it if I didn't fill up my schedule by saying “Yes!” to the dinner.
Saying “Yes!” is DEFINITELY worth it!
So, in a single week of saying “Yes!”, I managed to:
find friends to potentially do a Eurotrip with
get in touch with a skilled photographer
develop the habit of jogging every morning
have TONS of fun 😀
And that was just a single week! Imagine how much can happen if you say “Yes!” to the hundreds of little opportunities you encounter every day.
Saying “Yes!” can utterly transform your life, often in completely mysterious ways. I had no idea going to a dance show would lead to meeting a photographer. Jim Carrey's character had no idea what learning to play the guitar would lead to.
It seems like blind luck. But it happens far too often to be a co-incidence. There's just something about saying “Yes!” that can completely turn your life around.
Don't take my word for it. Try it yourself!
(Update: Several readers pointed out “Yes Man” was actually based on a real story. So it seems like I did a real-world experiment based on a movie based on a real-world experiment. Oh well 🙂 )
Mississippi-based wireless operator C Spire will be the first to deploy a new virtual pay-TV platform developed by MobiTV that delivers multichannel video to OTT and mobile platforms.
The MobiTV Connect Platform delivers IP video to Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and select smart TVs, as well as Android and iOS. The service features live-streaming of local broadcast stations and cloud DVR recording. MobiTV claims the platform has a "full linear TV lineup," but has not disclosed which cable channels are licensed for the bundle.
C Spire said it will begin beta testing the new service in November.
Multiscreen vendor MobiTV is billing the platform as an easy way for smaller cable operators to deliver IP video to customers.
"This is only the beginning for us," said Charlie Nooney, CEO of MobiTV, in a statement. "We continue to break barriers and utilize our long history in the video delivery space to help more companies future-proof their offerings through our ever-evolving, agile solutions within the video delivery ecosystem."
The service employs a unicast IP delivery platform team that focuses on micro-releases across a fully integrated CMS, DRM, Media Player, nDVR, content policy, identity management, billing and authentication.
"Since the service relies on in-home streaming and mobile devices, it eliminates the need for traditional set-top boxes," said Suzy Hays, senior VP of consumer markets for C Spire, also in a statement. "This next-generation service leverages our long-standing history of providing customer-inspired wireless experiences and will look and feel more like an app than your standard cable TV service with features such as in-depth search, personal recommendations and catch up TV."

Ben Affleck's Live By Night co-star Sienna Miller has expressed interest in a Batman role before. They previously said that she'd like to play Catwoman, but was told by Affleck that she's not in the script. But lucky for her, Affleck has a role in mind that they think she'd be perfect for.

During an interview with HeyUGuys, Affleck was told that Miller would be a perfect Vicki Vale. Affleck disagreed, saying “She's perfect for anything. Vicki Vale is kind of bitchy, I think she's better for like…”
Affleck then stopped himself, either because they didn't want to give away any secrets about The Batman, or because they knew even just suggesting a role would spread like wildfire online. Check out the quick clip below.
Let's assume Affleck does hire Miller for that perfect Batman role they have in their head. Who do you think they could play? Let me know in the comments below.

In impoverished countries, poverty is correlated with malnutrition and dangerously low body weight. In advanced economies like the United States, where food is plentiful, many researchers have put forward the theory that the opposite it true, that poor people are more likely to be obese.
In developed economies the quantity of food available to people is less of a differentiator than the quality of food that's available. While low-income people have access to food, they have less access to quality, healthy foods than high-income people do.
However, obesity might not be as closely related to poverty as it is to other factors, like race and gender.
In fact, a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that for black and Mexican-American men, obesity rates actually increased with income.
For women, the correlation between obesity and poverty seemed to bear out the theory. However, there is still a higher correlation between race and obesity than income and obesity.
For example, as income increased, obesity rates for both black and white women decreased. However, at the higher income level, obesity rates for white women fell much more than for black women.
Also, black and Hispanic women are much more likely to be obese to begin with. Obesity rates among black and Hispanic women are between 7 and 20 percentage points higher than those of white women in all income groups.
Note: The first chart uses data from 2011-2012. The second chart uses data from 2005-2008. The average obesity rate in the U.S. didn't change much in that time period, which makes the two datasets comparable. However, the gap in obesity rates among men and women closed -- which is why in the first chart the national average is used as the point of comparison, but national gender averages are used in the second chart.
Here's a map of obesity rates around the world, from a story that was published in July 2013.
Everyone knows that ranch is the preferred dipping sauce when it comes to McDonald's french fries. Okay, fine it might not be for everyone. But no matter what condiment you choose, getting less than you think you deserve doesn't mean it's okay to shoot the drive-thru window with a BB gun.
KRCR-TV reports that just such an incident occurred at a California McDonald's after a couple didn't receive ketchup with their order.
At around 12:15 a.m. on Tuesday, employees say a red car occupied by a man and a woman left the fast food restaurant upset over ketchup not being included in their order.
Shortly after the couple drove off, employees realized the drive-thru window had been shot out.
Upon police arrival it was determined that the window had two small holes in the glass and a small BB gun projectile was found on the ground near the window. Police also reported that two vehicles in the parking lot were damaged by BB gun projectiles.
About an hour later police officers located the red car in a nearby Walmart parking lot with the man and woman inside.
A search of the vehicle found three BB gun handguns, BB gun projectiles, McDonald's food packaging and drinks and a McDonald's receipt for a recent purchase close to the time of the reported shooting.
Both individuals were arrested on unrelated charges, but local officers say they would seek additional charges regarding their suspected involvement in the shooting.
