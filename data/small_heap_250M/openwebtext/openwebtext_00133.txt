Four vehicles were involved in a crash with a tanker truck spilled a large quantity of racing fuel, nearly closing southbound I-95 near Stanton at the height of Wednesday morning's rush hour.
Two drivers were injured and uncounted thousands of commuters delayed as the crash just after 8 a.m. created massive jams on the interstate, with all but one southbound lane closed for about two hours.
The crash also created delays on the other side of the interstate and nearby roads as motorists tried to evade delays one driver said kept her at a standstill for about 45 minutes, before she began to creep along in spurts – at about 5 mph.
No environmental damage or risk was reported from the spill of the racing fuel, although authorities could not say how much leaked from the damaged tanker. In radio broadcasts shortly after the crash, however, emergency personnel said were dealing with a spill of “hundreds of gallons.”
State police say the massive incident began with a driver's unsafe lane change, for which he later was ticketed.
Gerald Nichols, 24, of Wilmington, was driving a Ford Transit in the right lane when he started to move left, but failed to see the next lane was occupied by a Chrysler Town & Country van driven by Shawn R. Johns, 51, of Wilmington, said Master Cpl. Jeffrey R. Hale.
Nichols' vehicle hit the side of the van, forcing it into the center lane, where it hit the valves on the underside of the fuel tanker truck, driven by Turon McManus, 30, of Wilmington, Hale said.
The van then went back to the right-center lane, where it hit a Toyota Sequoia, driven by Loretta Consiglio-Ward, 50, of Wilmington, he said.
The tanker truck stopped on the right shoulder about a quarter-mile after the crash, Hale said.

Officials of the BRT company of Parkesburg, Pennsylvania, which had its logos on the tanker truck, told The News Journal they had no information about the crash and were not authorized to discuss the tanker's cargo and destination.
The fuel remaining in the truck was transferred to another tanker, Hale said.
Crews from the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control assisted in the fuel clean-up at the crash site, where crews from several fire companies responded.
Johns and Nichols – the drivers in the initial lane-change collision – were taken by emergency medical services to Christiana Hospital for treatment of injuries that were not life-threatening, Hale said. Both were using seat belts at the time of the crash, he said. The other drivers were not hurt.
Further complicating morning rush hour traffic were multiple minor crashes reported on the interstate about the same time as the one involving the tanker. Those crashes were on both sides of the highway, between Del. 141 and Del. 7, dispatch personnel said.

Republican Sasse Could Lend Legitimacy to Libertarians
by Josh Guckert
Yesterday, Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) announced that he plans to vote for president in November and that he and his wife will decide in October for whom to vote. Sasse definitively ruled out voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, stating that while he “hasn't looked closely” at Gary Johnson yet, that “the Libertarian Party is something [he] would certainly consider in the long term.”
Sasse clarified his comments on Twitter, asserting that he was not endorsing any presidential candidates, but that he and his wife will evaluate all candidates other than Trump and Clinton in October. To date, the only other candidate who will appear on Sasse's Nebraska ballot will be Gary Johnson — who was also the only third-party candidate to appear on the Nebraska ballot in 2012.
Also notable is that prospective third-party conservative candidate David A. French announced Sunday that he will not seek the presidency. Many states' filing deadlines are looming, and any effort to recruit an independent candidate will be no easy feat.
Sasse gained fame earlier this year when he became the first sitting Republican Senator to become part of the “Never Trump” movement. While some prodded Sasse to himself enter the presidential contest, he has dismissed such calls.
The junior Senator from Nebraska was elected in 2014, replacing the retiring Mike Johanns. In the brief time Sasse has been in the Senate, he has earned a 94% rating from FreedomWorks, good enough for fifth-best behind only Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Jeff Flake.
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are each just one day away from earning enough delegates to win their respective party's nomination, and Americans will soon be turning toward the November general election. With the conservative movement in general disarray and unlikely to find a feasible candidate, and the Green Party apparently not organized well enough to launch a national campaign, the battle-lines in all fifty states will soon be drawn between Trump, Clinton, and Johnson.
The Libertarian ticket of Johnson and William Weld has already received unprecedented amounts of attention since its nomination last Sunday. Johnson, when included in polls, has consistently tallied in double-digits, even with a majority of Americans still not knowing who he is.
The magical number for the LP in terms of polling is 15% — that being the percentage at which Johnson and Weld can become the first third-party candidates to participate in the nationally-televised debates since Ross Perot and James Stockdale in 1992. The ultimate goal of 5% of popular votes cast on Election Day is more important in the long term, as this would guarantee matching public funds and ballot access for the Libertarian Party in future elections. That feat was last accomplished by a third party by Perot in his second run at the presidency in 1996 as a member of the Reform Party.
With five months remaining in what has already been an unpredictable presidential election season, the Libertarian Party could see itself receiving what were previously thought of as unattainable endorsements and votes of confidence. If Senator Sasse does indeed decide to endorse Johnson and Weld, he could open the door for other Republicans and Democrats to follow suit.
Nonetheless, this year's election has the potential to be a great success for libertarians, as Americans seem to now be experiencing what lovers of liberty have warned against for a generation: the duopoly of a political party system wherein each side shares more in common with its so-called adversary more than it is willing to concede.
If Governors Johnson and Weld are able to successfully take their message to the American people in this time of anger and dissatisfaction, it could set the stage for not just a “libertarian moment,” but rather, a libertarian generation.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, speaks at a news conference to discuss the “Rebuild America Act” January 27, 2015 in Washington, D.C. (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images)
Bernie Sanders is in his natural state – of agitation.
It's just 9 a.m., but the socialist senator, contemplating a presidential run as a Democrat or as a populist independent, is red in the face and his white hair askew. In a conference room at The Washington Post, he's raising his voice, thumping his index finger on the table and gesturing so wildly that his hand comes within inches of political reporter Karen Tumulty's face.
“We are living in the United States right now at a time when the top one-tenth of 1 percent own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent,” the Vermont lawmaker says in his native Brooklyn accent.
“One family, the Walton family of Wal-Mart, owns by itself more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.”
And then there are the Kochs, “the second-wealthiest family in America, worth $85 billion . . . who are now prepared to buy the United States government.”
“You're looking at the undermining of American democracy, okay?”
Okay, okay, okay. I remark on his prodigious indignation.
“It's early in the morning,” Sanders boasts. “Catch me later in the afternoon.”
The real outrage, though, is that so few people share his fury.
There's widespread agreement about the problem – that inequality is as bad as it has been in America since the crash of '29. Even Republican leaders are talking about it (their solution, alas, is a tax system with even more breaks for the wealthy.) But there's no sign yet of the mass anger that could turn into a political movement.
This is the week we would have seen it. As my colleague Matea Gold reported, the Koch brothers and their fundraising network plan to spend $889 million on the 2016 race. That sort of brazen bid to buy an election should come with naming rights – perhaps the Charles G. and David H. Koch White House, to match the Charles G. and David H. Koch United States Senate they financed in 2014. A half-dozen of those whose new Senate seats were acquired with Koch money attended a Koch confab in Palm Springs over the weekend to thank their patrons.
But the news elicited no more outrage than did previous acquisitions of the House of Representatives (a.k.a. Citi Field). “The anger is there,” Sanders says, but “it's an anger that turns into saying, ‘Go to hell, I'm not going to participate in your charade. I'm not voting.' So it's a weird kind of anger. It's not people getting out in the streets . . . We're at the stage of demoralization.”
That leaves Sanders's populist candidacy in an awkward place. He can mount a symbolic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton that goes nowhere. “Can you mobilize people? Can you tap the anger that's out there?” Sanders asks rhetorically. “The answer is — you know what? — I don't exactly know that we can.”
Or he can run as an independent and perhaps take enough votes in a general election to be a spoiler. But he doesn't seem inclined to be a Ralph Nader, who doomed Al Gore in 2000 and saw no difference between the two parties. “There is a difference,” says Sanders, who caucuses with Senate Democrats.
Sanders faults President Obama for the current demoralization. “I think he had a moment in history to do what President Roosevelt did in 1932,” he says. “He had the opportunity to say to the American people, ‘Look, millions of people have lost jobs . . . [and] it's because of what JP Morgan did, it's because of what Morgan Stanley did, what Goldman Sachs did.”
“Is that moment today?” Sanders continues. “No. . . . I think he lost that extraordinary opportunity.” Democrats remain “too tepid” in taking on big money, and Clinton won't be “as bold as she needs to be.”
Clinton comes from the corporate wing of the party. Though there are nascent signs of a tea party of the left emerging, no candidate represents it. Sanders, 73, is charismatically challenged, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has more flair, doesn't appear to be contemplating a run. Even if she did, the primaries are so dominated by big money that it's not clear Warren could pose a viable challenge to Clinton.
No wonder Sanders is so agitated. “You have to take on the Koch brothers and you have to take on Wall Street and you have to take on the billionaires,” he says, gesticulating madly and fuming about the “oligarchy” running government. “Not to get you too nervous,” he says, but “I think you need a political revolution.”
As Sanders is learning, you can't have a populist revolution without people.

Editor's Note: The following is a lightly edited transcript of a story Iron Galaxy CEO Dave Lang told at a recent recording of The Nerdologue's Your Stories show. The episode was partially curated by yours truly. In Your Stories, folks are asked to share anecdotes from their personal lives based on a theme.
This time, the theme was "fingers crossed." The show was split into two parts, which you can listen to on The Nerdologue's website. At the very end of part two, you can hear me explain what the terrible movie Evil Bong III: The Wrath of Bong has to do with proposing to my wife. Anyone in Chicago can attend future Your Stories shows, and I hope to be curating another one in the near future! And with that, let's head to the Lang Zone...
In my extensive preparations for tonight's talk, which began this morning at 10:00 a.m., I was thinking a lot about hoping for the best, and it rarely, rarely coming through. I thought about much that hurt me throughout my life, and what I've done to combat that.
When it was Dave's turn, he announced he was going to stand up for his story. Of course.
Very recently, there's a good example of this. I tend to give a lot of talks as part of my job. I've developed something that helps me instantly determine how the talk is going to go. I usually start every talk like this. And, by the way, they're not all fun venues like this. They're normally "oh, I'm demo'ing for press" or I'm at some snooty conference giving an academic lecture or whatever. But I always start off every talk just like this:
"Hi, my name is Dave Lang. I'm the CEO of Iron Galaxy, and my favorite pony is Porkchop Applesauce."
[crowd laughter]
And I do that for a very good reason. It's not because I'm really into MLP or even know what MLP means. I do it because if people graciously giggle or laugh like you guys did, then I know the talk's going to go pretty well. Tonally, all my talks are the same. I don't take myself super seriously. I rarely take the material I'm presenting super seriously. I just want to get up here and have fun and vibe with the audience and just do my thing. If the audience doesn't laugh--and that happens shockingly frequently--if they're like "ooooh, I don't wanna listen to a brony," then I know I need to exit stage left and give them the abridged version.
That's me not wanting to worry about "oh, god, I hope this talk goes well." Because I don't care if you've done this one time or a thousand times, you're always a little nervous. You're always hoping it goes great. That's me trying to short circuit that process. I'm just finding out instantly if this is going to be great or shitty, and get on with it.
As I mentioned, I work at a video game developer. I've been making games my whole life, been making games for about 30 years--professionally, since '96. I'm going to share two stories about two games that will merge together like a true artist.
One was the first game that I ever released commercially--well, me and a team ever released commercially--and, more recently, a game we made at Iron Galaxy. The first one was '96, the second one was 2012.
So the first one was Space Jam for the Sega Saturn.
[crowd cheers]
Where were you fuckers 16 years ago? I swear to god. You make me so fucking mad.
But anywho. I've been making games my whole life, but there are things I wouldn't show people. I keep them to myself. Not because I was modest or scared or whatever. It just never occurred to me to show my friends. This was the first game I ever worked on. And my contribution to this, just to be clear, was tiny, tiny, tiny. I did the menus and some mini-games and some stuff like that. It was my first professional gig. I wanted it to be amazing, I wanted it to be something it could never be. This is a movie licensed game. It was never going to be up for game of the year awards, right? It was always destined to be this three-out-of-five, here's-what-it-is game. But I worked my ass off for that. I poured everything I had into it. And it's not because I had some boss breathing down my neck, it's because I wanted the game to be more than it could be.
Going through that, it didn't. It was released, and Next-Generation magazine, who was the most avant garde critical voice in the games journalism space at the time, they gave it a one star out of five.
[crowd boos]
Thank you, yeah!
They called it a "shitty NBA Jam clone." That's summating all the prose I read. It hit me really hard. It didn't just affect me. It, in turn, affected everyone around me. I was a dick to, at the time, my girlfriend, now wife. I was a total asshole to my co-workers. In short, I was pretty unpleasant to be around for a long time. I became aware of this over the course of the next couple of years.
Fast forward to 2012, and we're working on a game called Wreckateer for the Xbox 360.
[one crowd members cheers]
Yes, thank you. One person. That's about accurate.
Iron Galaxy is largely a tech house, which means it works on other people's games, instead of building its own.
The studio I work at, we're primarily a tech house. What that means is that we don't do a lot of original game development. What we do is take Scribblenauts, and we take it from the DS and put it on iPad or whatever. We do stuff like that. Getting the chance to make an original game is a really big deal for a tech house. It's a chance for you to break out, and become an actual developer. This was a really, really big deal for the studio. I was leading the project myself. Obviously, since it's my company, if the game does well, I was going to do really well, too. Everyone in the studio was going to do really well. So compared to Scribblenauts, I had much more to do with it. With Wreckateer, it was really my show. I had more riding on its success.
I still remember the day it came out. We had a launch party in the studio, and we had brought in a lot of beer and pizza and food. Along the wall was previous builds of the game. We had the first prototype, we had the first build we sent to Microsoft, every milestone we ever did. In the back, there was the released version of the game, so people could see it and play it. It was just this neat little thing. I don't know why I thought of this, but I said "hey, we could go back there and look at the leaderboards and see how it's doing!"
That was a mistake.
When we got done with the party at 2:00 a.m., about 2,500 people were on the leaderboards, which is the theoretical worst a game like this could do. It was really pushed by Microsoft, they really believed in it. And it was a good game! I stand by it. I still think it's fun. But there are a lot of reasons it failed, which we don't need to get into now, and certainly has nothing to do with me being a subpar developer or project lead!
I go to bed that last night, and was really bumming. Woke up the next day, and was mostly fine. How did that happen? When you look at Space Jam, I did so little, and I was devastated for years.
Somewhere along the line, and I'm not exactly sure where this happened, but a defense mechanism kicked in. It's not what about the game ends up being. It's about the journey and the people you made it is. We've made games that people liked, like Divekick. Or Blitz: The League. We've made some good games. I don't remember those reviews at all. I know that people have come up and thanked me for working on stuff like that. They might have told me about a time when a game I helped create give them joy and they needed it. But that's not really what I remember.
What I remember is the first time we got online in Third Strike working. It was 8 at night, and you could play it for the first time. It didn't matter that one screen had Ken and Ryu and the other had Chun-Li and Urien in it. It didn't matter. You were hitting buttons, and things were happening. I remember that. I remember staying up three days straight with my friends on Blitz: The League, trying to get a build ready for E3. Just trying to chase down one little bug that no one would have noticed. But we all gave a shit, which is why we did it. Those are the things I remember.
It's not about what the game ends up being or what people think of it. For me, it's about the journey. The thing I've figured out through all this, if you can say "fuck the destination, I'm about the journey," then nothing else matters. Thank you.
A narcotics detective in Springfield, Massachusetts has been suspended, but not fired, after he threatened to kill and plant drug evidence on two teenagers who had stolen an unmarked police car. His actions have jeopardized a number of drug cases.
The officer, Detective Gregg Bigda, was suspended by Springfield Police Commissioner John Barbieri for 60 days following an internal affairs investigation of an incident in February where Bigda interrogated two teenagers, who along with a third youth, were suspected of stealing an undercover police car that had been left idling outside a pizza shop.
A video of the interrogation, during which Bigda reportedly threatened to crush the skull of one of the teens and plant a kilo of cocaine in his pocket, was provided to defense attorneys who are now using it to impeach Bigda's credibility in pending drug cases.
Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno said he supports the commissioner's decision to suspend Bigda because of the likelihood firing him would not survive a civil service appeal and the city would be ordered to rehire the cop with back pay.
" I am not happy about it. This is what was recommended," Sarno said. " It is a most severe suspension of 60 working days without pay and retraining."
Barbieri told The Republican newspaper that Bigda will be reassigned to uniform duty on a day shift when his suspension ends.
Springfield City Councilor Justin Hurst, joined by four of his colleagues at a news conference, complained the punishment given Bigda is too lenient.
" I think we have to ask when it comes to this case, at what point, at what standard is there when the commissioner feels a cop shold be terminated," asked Hurst?
The incident involving the teens and the stolen police car remains under investigation by the Hampden District Attorney and the video of the interrogation, which occurred at the Palmer Police Department, has not been made public because a judge ordered it sealed to protect the identities of the juveniles.
Sarno has requested a review by attorneys for the city and the prosecutor's office to determine if any part of the video and other information in the Bigda case can be made public in the interest of transparency and accountability.
" We have to protect the integrity, professionalism, and brave efforts of our police department and in turn make sure our residents have complete confidence in our police department," said Sarno.
The stolen police car was recovered and the juveniles arrested outside the city. A report filed by a Wilbraham police officer said a Springfield Police Officer kicked one of the teens in the face while he was on the ground and in handcuffs. The report did not name the officer.
Springfield Police Det. Steven Vigneault, who reported the cruiser stolen, recently resigned from the force, according to The Republican.
Already, charges in two cases in which Bigda was a potential prosecution witness have been dismissed. Also, an alleged heroin dealer, who was facing a 10-30 year prison sentence if convicted, was allowed by prosecutors to plead as a first-time offender, and was released after spending three years in jail awaiting trial.
City Councilor Adam Gomez said Bigda's actions have harmed efforts to get drugs off the city's streets.
" It is a public safety issue with the opioid crisis and now some of these big dealers are going to be coming back to our communities," said Gomez. " We spend a lot of money trying to lock these people up and now look at what we are going to do."
City Council Vice-president Orlando Ramos renewed his call for Springfield police officers to wear body cameras.
" If there was a not a camera there this incident would never have been caught. So, the question is what other incidents are there that are not being caught on camera," he said.
City officials have said the issue of police wearing body cameras is a topic for collective bargaining with the patrolmen's union.
Just in: Jason Russell, one of the co-founders of Invisible Children, makers of last week's viral Kony 2012 video, was detained in the Pacific Beach area of San Diego, Calif., on Thursday for being drunk in public and masturbating, according to the San Diego Police Department.

NBCSanDiego.com is reporting that Russell, 33, was found masturbating in public, vandalizing cars and possibly under the influence of something, according to Lt. Andra Brown, who said Russell was acting very strange.
Police said they received several calls at 11:30 a.m. of a man in various stages of undress, running through traffic and screaming. Police described him as "in his underwear."
NBC News reports that Russell was taken into custody, then taken to a local medical facility.
Russell is one of the the founders responsible for the Kony 2012 video that went viral last week. He is described on the organization's website as a co-founder and "our grand storyteller and dreamer."
Invisible Children's CEO Ben Keesey released a statement to USA TODAY, saying: "Jason Russell was unfortunately hospitalized yesterday suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and malnutrition. He is now receiving medical care and is focused on getting better. The past two weeks have taken a severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday. Jason's passion and his work have done so much to help so many, and we are devastated to see him dealing with this personal health issue. We will always love and support Jason, and we ask that you give his entire family privacy during this difficult time."
Iowa Speedway hosts both NASCAR and IndyCar races, so when it looked for a way to spice up its track – rather than paying tribute to the one or both of the racing series – it chose something perfectly Iowa-themed instead.
New this season and on display for the .875-mile track's first 2017 races this weekend – the NASCAR Truck Series' M&M'S 200 on Friday and the XFINITY Series' American Ethanol E15 250 on Saturday – is a gigantic ear of corn painted across the start/finish line. It looks fantastic and is much more flashy than a traditional checkered flag design.
According to the track, the art installation will become a tradition moving forward as a nod to its relationship with the Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Corn Promotion Board.
And it will especially fit in for IndyCar's Iowa Corn 300 in July.
The deputy head of Russia's supreme security body says US international dominance is being replaced by multiple centers of power. He urged a global agreement on the results of the Cold War, warning that the world could otherwise become engulfed in chaos.
“The United States has an impression that the breakup of the Soviet Union was the only result of the Cold War. This is arguable, and this is possible. But no one has attempted to analyze the results or make any conclusions from the situation. The unipolar world headed by Americans simply appeared,” Evgeny Lukyanov told the RIA Novosti.
“However, this status quo was not built to last. New power centers have appeared on the international arena, including the BRICS nations, and Russia itself has managed to regain its stance. Nations openly declare their interests and demand respect to their basic rights. This is how the US hegemony on the international arena has ended and of course Washington officials cannot agree with this,” the Russian official stated.
Lukyanov emphasized in the interview that the USSR was no more.
“Russia is a different state, a participant of international processes and we want to have a say, we have national interests which we intend to defend,” he said.
“This caused the West to overreact, on the verge of hysteria. But you cannot ignore the ‘Russia factor' in the world,” the official added.
Lukyanov told reporters that all nations should gather and reach an agreement finalizing the Cold War. He suggested that it is done at a global congress of all major players and said that the only existing organization for such task is the UN and its Security Council.
“Otherwise, we will have no rules of the game, no agreements. Violations will happen without concrete obligations, and the world will become less manageable and more chaotic,” he said.
Lukyanov also touched upon the current situation in Ukraine and mentioned that US advisors were actively helping the Kiev regime.
“I am talking about intelligence specialists and people from US power structures. Of course, these people do not limit themselves to advice, they are developing a strategic line that the authorities are following strictly in making their decisions,” he noted.
The official also recalled that Russia also used US advisors during the reforms of the early '90s and said that the results of this cooperation could be a warning to everyone who decides to repeat it.
He also said that it was unlikely that Kiev officials could establish order while using mercenaries from private military companies, such as Greystone Limited. German press has reported earlier that about 400 contractors from US private security firms were taking part in the Ukrainian military operation against anti-government protesters in southeastern regions of the country.
Photo radar is coming to Circle Drive.
Police say they'll be introducing the traffic enforcement tool at several spots this fall. This is to help combat speeding on the roadway.
It's too busy for police to safely pull over vehicles.
The move also mirrors police concerns with speeding in the city.
"We have had too many encounters in recent years with people who are intent upon evading police, and they are doing so with complete disregard to public safety," said Alyson Edwards with the city police.
On Saturday, a 21-year-old motorcyclist was clocked going 180 kilometres an hour on Circle Drive, twice the speed limit. And just a few weeks ago, a car was stopped going 200 kilometres an hour.
New penalties for excessive speeding came into effect in June. They include seven day vehicle seizures.
Developing a healthy attitude to food and exercise. Photo: Getty Images
When you have children, most people are generally not looking ahead to the teenage years, but it is important that the foundations for developing a healthy body image start early. While eating disorders can occur in people at any age, evidence shows that adolescents are increasingly at risk. Instilling your child early with the necessary skills to cope with the pressures they can be faced with from the media and their peers will act as protection against developing negative attitudes and behaviours towards food and exercise.
For many people, eating disorders represent the extreme case scenario. Many still assume eating disorders only affect spoilt teenage girls who spend too much time trying to emulate the latest Hollywood reality star. Most people also assume an eating disorder will never happen to them or one of their kids. But eating disorders specialists see people from all walks of life, from different socio-economic backgrounds and males as well as females.
Most young people with an eating disorder that use Eating Disorders Victoria's services come from loving families, have good educations and their parents and families don't know why their loved one is affected by this devastating illness.
Whilst there is no magic bullet in preventing your child from developing an eating disorder, there are a number of things you can do as a parent to help develop protective factors and boost your child's self-esteem and body image. A person's family, friends, acquaintances, teachers and the media all have an impact on how that person sees and feels about themselves and their appearance.
Children are very impressionable so it is important to be a positive role model. Here are some tips that you can implement into your everyday routine to assist you in having a positive influence upon your child's attitudes to their body, food and exercise.
Avoid making disparaging comments about your own appearance in front of your children. Being self critical in front of your kids normalises this type of behaviour and can see kids adopt the same attitudes. Even if you feel like an outfit clings in all of the wrong places and you decide to change, use comments like “the colour clashed” or “I think I would be more comfortable in something else”, instead of saying “I looked really fat” or “it made my butt look huge”. Belonging to a family that does not overemphasize weight and physical attractiveness is known to be a protective factor against developing an eating disorder.
Refrain from using extreme weight loss practices. Once again it is about teaching a healthy and relaxed attitude to food from a young age. Disordered eating, of which dieting is the most common form, is the greatest risk factor in the development of an eating disorder. Even if your child never develops an eating disorder, one of the best things you can do for your child is to not normalise yo-yo or fad weight loss dieting. Weight loss and ‘fad' diets do not take individual requirements into consideration and can result in a person feeling hungry, experiencing low moods, lacking in energy levels and developing poor health.
Remind your children that people come in different shapes and sizes and the way that young people develop is hugely influenced by genetics, regardless of lifestyle factors. Teach your children to accept body shape diversity amongst their peers and themselves, and to not try and compare their own bodies with others. It is important to help your child to understand that everyone's body is different and will develop at different rates.
Eat regular meals as a family. Studies have indicated that family meal time is a protective factor against the development of an eating disorder as it encourages open communication and provides kids with a structured meal time. In order to create a pleasant space where children feel comfortable, avoid discussing family issues or eating habits at the table; don't insist everything on the plate must be eaten but to at least taste it all; and teach your child to eat all foods slowly and appreciatively in a relaxed and guilt-free manner.
Avoid categorizing foods as ‘good' or ‘bad' and rather as ‘sometimes' and ‘everyday' foods. By adopting an overall healthy and relaxed attitude to eating, it can help avoid the guilt associated with having the odd ‘sometimes food'. It can also help reduce the likelihood of engaging in excessive weight loss dieting or binge eating.
Adopt a healthy and relaxed attitude to exercise and treat it as an enjoyable activity as opposed to compensate for calories eaten or to purge fat from your body. Exercise with your kids and adopt it as a fun family pastime. Children who come from families that enjoy healthy doses of exercise will be more likely to exercise in a positive way themselves.
The role of the media
Children are often unable to distinguish advertising tricks such as digital manipulation from reality. This can result in the development of unrealistic body image ideals and the use of dieting and other means to obtain the look for themselves. Media literacy is an invaluable skill for both children and adults as it provides people with the ability to analyse and evaluate the messages they receive from the media. Media messages about dieting, exercise, fat and weight loss shows send many unhelpful and unhealthy messages that many argue are inappropriate for younger children (or in general). Rather than instilling our children with a fear of fat, aim to send healthier messages about balance and moderation.
Adopting a healthy, relaxed approach to eating and exercise is a positive start to ensuring your child develops the skills to cope with societal pressures as well as having a positive relationship with food and physical activity.
If you are concerned that your child is at risk of developing an eating disorder, contact the Eating Disorders Helpline 1300 550236 or visit www.eatingdisorders.org.au.
On August 17, three Hong Kong students, leaders of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, were sentenced for daring to call for the protection of democratic process. Joshua Wong, Alex Chow, and Nathan Law received prison terms of eight, ten, and eight months, respectively, from the Hong Kong Court of Appeals. Their nominal crimes were unlawful assembly (Wong and Chow) and inciting others to participate in unlawful assembly (Law). But make no mistake: by targeting these three young activists, both the Hong Kong government and Beijing aimed to punish them as individuals as well as send a warning to other would-be democracy activists.
Speaking before the verdict was rendered, Wong said, “There's no longer rule of law in Hong Kong, its rule by law.” What he so poignantly identified here is a pattern in the central Chinese government's dealings with Hong Kong. Rather than silence opposition directly, as Beijing is apt to do within the borders of the PRC, or use extrajudicial violence to silence dissidents as it did by kidnapping dissident Hong Kong booksellers last year, China is increasingly relying upon a selective application of the law to force Hong Kong citizens to follow the party line. In other words, in order to effectively silence opposition voices, it relies upon judicial decisions that may be legally correct but stand opposed to justice and democracy.
Only two days prior, another activist protesting authoritarianism in Asia received his own prison sentence. On Tuesday, August 15, three judges in the Khon Kaen provincial court in northeastern Thailand sentenced Jatupat Boonpattararaksa, widely known by his nickname, Pai, a law student and democracy activist, to two and a half years in prison. Pai's nominal crime was to share a BBC Thai article about the new king, Rama X, or Maha Vajiralongkorn, on Facebook.
As with the Hong Kong students' case, the imprisonment of Pai may be legally correct, but the actions for which he is being punished exceed those named in the court decision. Also similar
Trade ministers from around the world are concluding a contentious week of negotiations in Nairobi, Kenya under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha Development Round. Thus far, there is no indication that Pope Francis, when he was in Nairobi three weeks earlier, blessed the Kenyatta International Convention Center where the summit will take place.
Given the intransigent tone of the U.S. and other developed country representatives, a papal blessing may be the only thing that can produce an outcome worthy of the WTO's current mandate to promote development. The United States is demanding nothing less than the ending of the Doha Round.
A welcome shot in the arm came earlier this week from Dr. Hilal Elver, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, who issued a statement urging negotiators to deepen their commitment to achieving the development objectives of the Doha Round. She called it “profoundly troubling” that a “handful of countries” are calling for an end to Doha.
Trade rules and the right to food
The Special Rapporteur's sharply worded statement highlights the importance of fair trade in achieving the U.N. mandate for governments to promote “the progressive realization of the right to food.” Trade rules can – and do – undermine food security in developing countries in a number of ways, and many of those issues are at the center of the WTO's agriculture negotiations.
Trade rules allow excessive levels of “domestic support” for their farmers by rich countries, which results in the “dumping” of cheap, subsidized commodities on developing country markets.
WTO rules, strictly applied, can threaten legitimate food security programs, such as the public procurement of staple food crops at administered prices (to benefit poor farmers) for distribution to the poor at subsidized prices. Many countries, including the WTO host government of Kenya, maintain such programs.
India's vastly expanded food security program came under fire from the United States and a few other countries, which used arcane WTO calculations to inflate the estimated subsidy implied by such programs. The conflict almost prevented agreement in Bali, Indonesia two years ago.
Such conflicts between trade rules and the right to food prompted a public dust-up in 2011 between then-WTO head Pascal Lamy and then-Special Rapporteur Olivier De Schutter. De Schutter had issued a briefing note identifying the many ways in which WTO rules undermined the right to food. As a human right, De Schutter argued, the right to food should take precedence and trade rules should promote rather than impede its realization.
The subsequent attack on India's National Food Security Act (NFSA) only highlighted De Schutter's point. India's National Food Security Act (NFSA), approved in 2013, seeks to reach hundreds of millions of poor farmers with better prices while providing basic foods to fully two-thirds of the nation's people. It represents a huge step toward achieving the right to food, which had been formally upheld by the Indian Supreme Court.
United States farm policies under fire
The United States led the calls in Bali to question India's food security measures, calling them – apparently with a straight face – an unfair subsidy to India's farmers. The hypocrisy of that charge was only made more stark by the passage the following year of the new U.S. farm bill.
Though claiming to reduce “trade-distorting” subsidies, the bill may well end up increasing them. Early projections suggest that commodity payments to farmers will be around US$12 billion, higher than in recent years. There is little doubt that U.S. cotton subsidies will have such a “price-suppressing” effect.
A recent study estimated that removing the new subsidies to cotton, which were supposed to be WTO-compliant, would reduce U.S. exports by 29 percent while raising prices 7 percent. The costs of lowered prices and lost markets to other cotton producers were estimated at US$3.3 billion per year, US$16 billion over the five-year life of the farm bill.
India, the country the United States accuses of unfairly subsidizing its farmers, would be one of the hardest hit, with lost cotton revenues of US$800 million per year. The so-called Cotton 4 West African countries – Mali, Chad, Benin, and Burkina Faso – which had been promised “expeditious” action on U.S. cotton subsidies fully ten years ago, now face losses collectively of US$80 million per year.
Will the WTO abandon development?
U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, in a bold stroke of hypocrisy, opened his speech to the WTO plenary calling on trade representatives “to move beyond the cynical repetition of positions designed to produce deadlock.” Deadlock, of course, is exactly what Froman wants so he can start shaping the WTO in the image of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement far more to the liking of the U.S. negotiators.
This is no time to abandon the development mandate embodied in the WTO's Doha Round. More than one hundred WTO member countries issued a statement challenging the call to end the negotiations, citing Doha's many unmet promises. The African group issued a statement with India and other developing country allies demanding the reaffirmation of the Doha mandate.
Special Rapporteur Hilal Elver agrees. She particularly urged the removal of rich country policies that “hamper efforts by developing country governments to increase domestic food production, particularly by smallholder farmers whose families are among the world's hungry.”
If rich countries are permitted to jettison the Doha Round and put their own priority issues on the table instead, we'll be looking at what the late great U.S. baseball legend Yogi Berra called “déjà vu all over again” – a few developed countries setting the agenda and writing the rules in their own interests. That history is what prompted the present effort to seek greater equity in the WTO. It should not be abandoned.

Can we expect resistance to metric adoption from the food/supermarket lobbies?
Based on what I've come across so far, the answer would be “Yes.” Early on I had someone “in the know” tell me that grocery stores had been against metric adoption during our last push in the 1970s because they would get caught between metric units and consumers, as in “I can't buy a kilogram of hamburger. What the heck is a kilogram?” But I think it goes deeper than that.
Uniform measures make it more difficult to deceive customers
Food manufacturers and supermarkets will continue to play games with us as along as it benefits them. In the 1967 copyrighted, The Thumb on the Scale or the Supermarket Shell Game by A. Q. Mowbray, (In chapter 3, “The Package as Salesman”), he points out that after World War II, the dynamic between the food retailer and consumers shifted as the public stopped going to local “markets” and started shopping in “supermarkets.” Without the human interface and a large array of products within a category (cereal again comes to mind), and with the generally high quality of most of the offerings…
Packaging is no longer merely a method of holding or containing the product for storing and shipping. It is now a major element in the advertising and promotional campaign. It is a full-fledged salesman. p.13
The author then includes a quote from a sales promotion manager:
Some food processors are actually in the packaging business rather than the food business. p.13
Fast forward almost 50 years and things really haven't changed that much.
I started poking around in food retailing publications and came across this quote:
Thus, food manufacturers are still under fire for misleading claims, promises and labeling. The article, “The Natural Debate: Your Consumer Is Your Regulator” was dated March 4, 2014 and was linked to from Supermarketnews.com.
Obviously, we're still the target of manipulators as manufacturers try to get us to buy their products and stores try to sell us items with the highest profit margins.
Making easy cost comparisons when buying food—how prevalent?
I remember a time when I had trouble figuring out which food was the least expensive since the “unit price” amount didn't always use the same base (as in “cost per ounce” for coffee versus “cost per pound”). A recent trip to my grocery store (Smith's) revealed no such problem with the labels on the shelf. All were clearly marked and easy to compare. However, a little more digging revealed that application of unit pricing regulations is not uniform within our country. While my state does not necessarily adhere to unit pricing, apparently my supermarket chain does.
However, I was able to find examples of mixed unit pricing to show you on Amazon.com.
Note the two weights on flour sold in its site. In one the “cost per” is pound and other one lists ounce. Frankly, I can't do that math in my head to figure out which is the best deal without a calculator.
How the metric system could help in the supermarket
If we were using the metric system for these things comparisons would become easier since larger and smaller amounts relate to each other by multiples of 10, 100, or 0.1, 0.001, so you'd just move a decimal point in one direction or the other and not have to deal with the crazy 16 ounces in a pound we use now.
I'm not saying we couldn't get deceived when we're buying food or other items once we've converted to the metric system but it should make our lives (and those of our children…) a little easier. Isn't that worth a little hassle in the short term?
Thanks,
Linda

A list of 24 survivors who lost their entire families shown at the Halabja Monument in 2015.
HALABJA, Kurdistan Region — Two survivors of the 1988 Halabja chemical attack have died awaiting long-delayed treatments because of budget cuts by the Iraqi government, raising to 89 the number of initial survivors who have died since 2003.
The Iraqi government under the Saddam Hussein regime bombarded Halabja with banned chemical weapons on March 16, 1988, which immediately resulted in an estimated 5,000 dead Halabjans and left another 10,000—many who cannot afford costly treatments outside Iraq—injured.
Haji Mahmud, who was blinded by the attack, died last week. Another survivor, Akram Rashid, died in January from health complications.
According to the Halabja Chemical Victims Society, there are now 400 attack survivors who need treatment for cancer, respiratory and dermatological problems; 254 of whom need urgent special treatment abroad.
The Kurdistan region has been struggling with a financial crisis since January 2014 when the Iraqi government cut its budget in opposition to Kurdistan's independent oil exports. As a result, salaries were delayed, projects put on hold and social and health programs slashed, including the treatment program for Halabja victims funded by the Kurdistan Regional Government.
Under a Baghdad-Erbil deal struck in December 2014, the Iraqi government is supposed to send the KRG's budget payments in return for the Kurds exporting 550,000 barrels per day (BPD). The monthly payments are often delayed and have not been enough to cover the KRG's expenses.
“The lives of human beings should not be linked to a financial crisis,” the Halabja Chemical Victims Society said in a statement last week. It also called on the KRG and Iraqi government to fulfil their responsibilities to victims.
The treatment program began in 2005 when the regional government of Carinthia in Austria agreed to cover the treatment costs of eight injured survivors for two weeks. Then the Kurdistani presidency funded the program for 65 injured in 2007 and finally the KRG's ministry of Martyrs and Anfal Affairs took over responsibility.
The Iraqi High Criminal Court recognized the Halabja massacre as an act of genocide in March 2010. On April 14, the remembrance day of the Anfal genocide campaign in Kurdistan, the KRG said in a statement that Baghdad should be held accountable for the Kurdish genocide and has “morale and legal obligations” to compensate the survivors.
Greeting his "fellow enemies of the people," veteran political reporter and author John Heilemann told a crowd of journalists Monday (March 14) that it feels like First Amendment values are more important than ever and potentially more at risk, while fellow reporter Mark Halperin had a slightly different take, encouraging journalists to avoid gloom-and-doom scenarios.
Broadcast executive Stanley Hubbard said he thought the First Amendment was safe and that Donald Trump has the right to be a jerk just like everyone else.
Heilemann and Halperin, creators, executive producers, and co-hosts of Showtime's The Circus, were receiving the Radio-Television Digital News Foundation First Amendment award, while Hubbard was honored -- along with his late father, Stanley E. Hubbard -- with the First Amendment Leadership Award, at a dinner in Washington.
Saying he was the first, but probably not the last, to point it out -- he wasn't -- Heilemann said that the current administration "seems to think that we in the journalism profession are part of the opposition." The White House's attitude, both implicitly and explicitly, is more hostile and disdainful of what journalists do than any in his lifetime, he said.
He focused on what he said was the administration's "wanton disregard for the truth" and "constant lying" about things both large and small, profound and trivial.
He said journalism as a business faces an "enormous challenge," both individually and as an institution. "
Heilemann said he was asked recently at an event what had happened to objective and dispassionate journalists. He said his answer was that dispassionate journalism was the last thing that was needed. Journalism needs to be "passionate and fearless about what matters most: About what is true and passionate about holding the powerful interests in this country, and particularly about those in this administration, to account on behalf of the public."
A little more than 50 days into the new administration, Heilemann said he was heartened by how media outlets in print, radio, TV and digital were relentlessly and competitively rising to the challenge.
Halperin, who shared the award with Heilemann, tried to put the best face on a tough situation. He had three things to add about covering the current Administration.
First, he said, journalists should not "make it personal." He said it was a mistake to make it a "personal fight," and to that extent, said journalists do need to be "dispassionate about our role..." Second, while journalism's business models are changing, what can't change is the responsibility to be "zealous guardians" of the public trust that is the First Amendment, regardless of the technology or distribution platform. Third, he said journalists should do their jobs joyfully, just as politicians at their best are happy warriors (the usually-smiling progressive Hubert Humphrey's famous moniker).
Halperin advised against becoming "apocalyptically negative" about what is currently going on as though the country is going to end, adding, "I don't think we serve our profession well. I think we can be happy warriors while we fight for the First Amendment and hold all powerful interests accountable."
Hubbard, CEO of Hubbard Broadcasting, said he was not as negative about the current political situation as some.
"I think the president has the right to be a jerk just like anybody else," he said, adding that it was his right of free speech to say things that might sound stupid. He said not a Donald Trump or anyone else is going to take away the First Amendment.
"Just keep doing what you're doing and do it well and you'll never have to worry about that First Amendment," Hubbard said. "Everything is going to be fine."
On 14 July 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made the first-ever flyby of distant Pluto. Amid the excitement of this tremendous event, an oft-repeated and celebrated quote was “we have completed the initial reconnaissance of the Solar System.” When it comes to science, completed is a big word, and the Solar System an even bigger place. What does it mean to complete an initial reconnaissance, and are we really done?
The Solar System is full of mileposts. For most of the 85 years since Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto, it has been the most distant of those mileposts. Delivering a spacecraft to anywhere in space isn't easy, much less after a 7.5-billion-km ultramarathon. Making it to Pluto and learning more about it is an historic scientific and technological accomplishment.
But there's more to it than that. The Solar System is not just 8 (formerly 9) planets. Indeed, the Kuiper Belt (and the Oort Cloud beyond) is the most populous collection of bodies and contains other large objects, from Eris, comparable in size to Pluto, to the football-shaped Haumea. Pluto is the first to be reached, and after traveling another billion miles, New Horizons aims to fly by another object in the Kuiper Belt in early 2019. One thing that we have learned in exploring the Solar System is that planetary bodies are usually far more complex than we expect, and the data from New Horizons have reinforced that fact since the very first image came down. There is so much left to explore—and not just beyond Pluto.
The Voyager spacecraft provided first-look flybys of the gas giant planets in the outer Solar System, similar to how New Horizons explored Pluto. However, our knowledge of these worlds and particularly their orbiting moons is not complete, especially for Uranus and Neptune. Indeed, small new moons continue to be discovered. Yet, the Galileo mission to Jupiter in the 1990s and the Cassini spacecraft currently around Saturn have demonstrated that from the tectonics and oceans of Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, to the atmosphere and seas of Titan, the icy worlds of the outer solar system have a lot to teach us about how the Solar Systems works. Fortunately, new missions by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) to study Jupiter's icy moons up close are on the (distant) horizon. However, with two other giant planets, there is much undiscovered country to explore.
While we have seen much more of the more Earth-like planets and moons of the inner Solar System, our exploration here is also not complete. Furthermore, the inner Solar System has other inhabitants. NASA's Dawn spacecraft and its visits to Vesta and Ceres and ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have shown how reconnaissance of the much smaller and more numerous planetary residents and visitors of the inner regions of the Solar System must continue.
The breathtaking data from Pluto serve as a reminder that the Solar System has much to teach us; we just have to keep exploring.

The inescapable "Bye, Felicia" meme was born from Ice Cube's "Friday" back in 1995, creating the perfect dismissal hashtag years before Twitter had a chance to help further popularize it. The phrase, which the Internet has since integrated into social media vernacular, received a nod in the Cube-produced biopic "Straight Outta Compton" and sparked quite a response -- for both its humorous tone and its problematic portrayal of women.
The reference, which was an unscripted improvisation by Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr., appears in the film after Eazy-E had been getting intimate with a groupie in a hotel room, only to find out she had a (large, angry) boyfriend looking for her. She was subsequently shoved out of N.W.A's crowded hotel room.
"Ice Cube's character takes Felicia and says, 'Bye, Felicia' and kind of shuts the door on her in the hotel, while she's just standing there topless," music journalist Sowmya Krishnamurthy explained on HuffPost Live.
Krishnamurthy said the theater roared with laughter during the scene when she viewed it, but she felt troubled.
"When I was in the theater, it got a huge laugh from men and women. It's a very kind of lighthearted scene, but as a woman, you're conflicted," she told host Zerlina Maxwell. "You're kind of left wondering. She was good enough to have sex with, but afterwards you shame her and literally shut her out of the hotel, almost punishing her for the behavior that two seemingly consenting adults were having."

Fraudulent Misinvoicing of Trade Transactions Accounts for 92.7% of Brazil's Illicit Outflows; Underground Economy Averaged 38.9% of Brazil's Official GDP
Customs Enforcement, Transparency Measures, Political Will Seen as Key to Curbing Crime, Corruption, and Tax Evasion
Press Event to Be Held at JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro at 11am Local Time on Monday, September 8th, Day-Long Conference on Illicit Flows to Follow-on Tuesday, September 9th
Está disponível em português.
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil / WASHINGTON, DC – More than US$400 billion flowed illegally out of Brazil between 1960 and 2012— draining domestic resources, driving the underground economy, exacerbating inequality, and facilitating crime and corruption—according to a new report to be published Monday, September 8th at a press event in Rio de Janeiro by Global Financial Integrity (GFI), a Washington DC-based research and advocacy organization.
Titled “Brazil: Capital Flight, Illicit Flows, and Macroeconomic Crises, 1960-2012,” the study finds that trade misinvoicing—the fraudulent over- and under-invoicing of trade transactions—accounted for the vast majority (92.7 percent) of the country's illicit financial outflows over the 53-year period analyzed.
“Brazil has a very serious problem with illicit financial flows, and curtailing them should be a priority for whichever administration wins the forthcoming elections,” noted GFI President Raymond Baker, a longtime authority on financial crime. “Illicit outflows are draining billions of dollars each year from the official Brazilian economy; money that could otherwise be used to help the nation's economy grow. Beyond the direct loss to the economy, these outflows are driving the underground economy, fueling crime and corruption, and costing the government significant revenue.”
Findings
Authored by GFI Chief Economist Dev Kar, the study estimates that illicit financial flows from Brazil totaled US$401.6 billion from 1960 through 2012, with annual average illicit outflows increasing from US$310 million in the 1960s to US$14.7 billion in the first decade of the twenty first century before jumping to US$33.7 billion over the last three years of the study, 2010-2012. On average, Brazil's illicit outflows are equivalent to 1.5 percent of the country's GDP.
“Illicit outflows drain capital from the Brazilian economy, facilitate tax evasion, exacerbate inequality, and deplete domestic savings,” said Dr. Kar, who served as a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund before joining GFI. “Even more troubling, our study finds that illicit outflows have grown over time—averaging just over US$300 million per annum in the 1960s, they're averaging over US$30 billion per year today. Unless corrective actions are taken, the economic toll of these illicit flows only will continue to grow.”
The report reveals that the vast majority of Brazil's illicit outflows—92.7 percent, or US$372.3 billion of the US$401.6 billion in total outflows—were channeled through the misinvoicing of trade transactions. The remaining US$29.4 billion in the illicit outflows detected by GFI occurred via hot money outflows, such as unrecorded wire transfers.
“Trade misinvoicing is the dominant channel for illicitly moving money out of Brazil,” noted Dr. Kar. “While our global analyses find that trade misinvoicing constitutes roughly 80 percent of illicit flows worldwide, the problem is particularly severe in Brazil, where it accounts for 92.7 percent of the country's illicit outflows.
Broad Capital Flight
In addition to estimating illicit outflows of capital from Brazil, the study also estimates that broad capital flight—a combination consisting of both licit and illicit outflows—amounted to US$590.2 billion between 1960 and 2012. Illicit outflows constituted 68 percent of total capital flight, and they were shown to drive broad capital flight from Brazil.
Underground Economy
The report also found that the underground economy averaged 38.9 percent of official GDP over the 53-year period, increasing from an average of 45.8 percent in the 1960s to 55.1 percent in the 1970s before slowly falling to an average of 21.8 percent from 2010 through 2012, as a result of faster economic growth.
Just as with broad capital flight, the study finds that illicit financial outflows drive the underground economy, implying that efforts to curtail illicit financial outflows would also curtail broad capital flight and significantly reduce the size of the underground economy.
Policy Recommendations
“For many years we have observed reticence in Brazil to address problems of capital flight and illicit outflows,” stated Mr. Baker, who will launch the report at a press event Monday morning in Rio de Janeiro. “It is, however, a real and growing problem, as our research shows, and it merits serious attention by policymakers.”
GFI recommends a number of steps the Brazilian government can take to ameliorate the problem of illicit financial flows from the country revolving around two principles:
Greater transparency in domestic and international financial transactions, and Greater cooperation between governments to shut down the channels through which illicit money flows.
These steps include taking stronger legal measures against trade misinvoicing, instituting transparency of company ownership, and building the technical and human capacity needed to effectively utilize the data that will be shared under emerging tax information exchange arrangements.
“Overall, Brazil has an established financial infrastructure, a strong commitment to democratic governance, and many of the laws and procedures needed to curb illicit financial flows and rein in the underground economy already in place,” noted GFI Policy Counsel Joshua Simmons, who contributed to the policy section of the report. “However, these advantages must be coupled with the capacity and political will to fully implement and enforce such measures. Curtailing illicit financial flows must become a priority throughout the Brazilian government.”
Methodology
The study is one of the most methodologically rigorous analyses of illicit financial flows produced by GFI to date. Dr. Kar—assisted by GFI Associate Economist Brian LeBlanc—developed robust economic models consisting of ten different equations that highlight the drivers and dynamics of illicit flows.
Nevertheless, Dr. Kar cautioned that the methodology is very conservative and that there are likely to be more illicit flows from Brazil that are not captured by the models.
“The estimates provided by our methodology are likely to be extremely conservative as they do not include trade misinvoicing in services, same-invoice trade misinvoicing, hawala transactions, and dealings conducted in bulk cash,” explained Dr. Kar. “This means that a large amount of the proceeds of abusive transfer pricing between arms of the same multinational corporation as well as much of the earnings from drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other criminal activities—which are often settled in cash—are not included in these estimates.”
Press Event: Monday
Global Financial Integrity will launch the report at press conference at the JW Marriott Hotel Rio de Janeiro on Monday, September 8, 2014 at 11am local time. The event will feature a brief presentation of the report and its findings by GFI President Raymond Baker, followed by a question and answer period for journalists. Simultaneous English/Portuguese translation will be provided.
Full Day Conference: Tuesday
Following the launch of the report, GFI is partnering with the Rio de Janeiro-based Multidisciplinary Institute for Development and Strategies (MINDS) to host a one-day conference, titled “Illicit Financial Flows in Brazil: A Hidden Resource for Improving Prosperity and Economic Stability,” on Tuesday, September 9, 2014 featuring remarks from Brazilian and international experts on the scale, causes, and consequences of illicit financial flows in Brazil and potential policy responses.
GFI trusts that the report and the conference will begin a constructive dialogue with the Brazilian government about measures that can be taken to curtail illicit flows.
“We hope that this study will spur the Government of Brazil to consider effective legislative and regulatory measures to curb the flow of illicit money from the country, thereby maximizing domestic resources for economic growth,” added Mr. Baker. “GFI's goal is to work constructively in conjunction with government officials to curtail these harmful illicit flows.”
Funding
Funding for the new report, “Brazil: Capital Flight, Illicit Flows, and Macroeconomic Crises, 1960-2012,” was generously provided by the Ford Foundation.

Description: Family of six downsizes from 2500 square foot house to tiny home.

So there's a new version of House Hunters called Tiny House Hunters. It's about regular-sized people buying tiny houses, not little people buying regular-sized houses. The day after Christmas/Boxing Day, my sister and I were watching this episode and I paused it after about five minutes and then shouted to my mom, "Oh my God, you have to come watch this. These are the worst parents in the world."
Dan and Cindy, parents of the year.
These are the worst parents in the world, Dan and Cindy. And I don't just think Dan is a terrible parent because he has a goatee and is wearing a wacky button-down. Dan is an animator (also not the main reason I think he is a terrible parent) and Cindy is a speech therapist. They live in Santa Clarita, CA with their four kids: Emilia, 13, Isabel, 9, and twins William and Adeline, 2.
This mansion is just too big for them.
Dan and Cindy are the worst parents in the world because they have decided to move their entire family - all six of them - from their 2500 square foot house to a 600 square foot house in Corning, NY. And why are they doing this? Well, last summer they went on a weeks-long, 30 state road trips with all four kids. Then, when they got back home, all four kids went to their separate bedrooms. Now, this may seem normal to you because you're a sane person who would need to be alone after spending weeks in a minivan with your family, but for Dan and Cindy, this was cause for concern. "I got back from the trip and the kids went off to their rooms and the space spread us all out and I said to Dan, 'I think we could live in a tiny house'," Cindy says. Dan also explains further, "Em is going to be 14 and we just started to realize she's not going to be in our house very much longer and so we need to strip down to the core of what this family is." Because what you want to do right as your daughter enters her teen years is take away all her privacy. A+ plan. She's gonna murder-suicide the whole family.
The older girls look thrilled.
Now, I have lived in some small houses with my family, but we lived in those places because we had to, not because we wanted to. And we got through it, it was fine, whatever, but it's also a huge pain in the ass to be in confined spaces with one bathroom and no privacy and constantly on top of one another. I understand wanting to get out of the LA rat race and live closer to Cindy's family, but you can do so without moving your four kids into a 600 square foot house. There's a happy medium between 2500 square feet and 600.
Your overly attached tiny house hunter.
BUT ANYWAY, Cindy wants their 600 foot house to be a craftsman bungalow, but Dan wants a log cabin. Cindy want their 600 foot house to be in a Claring neighborhood, but Dan wants to be in a rural area with lots of acreage. They both want a fixer-upper. Their budget is $80,000 and they're going to pay for the house in cash. Cindy says, "This is one of those leaps that other people say, 'You can't do this.'" So you're doing this out of spite, got it.
Their realtor is Ruthie. She is a gem and the best part of this episode.
Good for the Unabomber, maybe not a family of six.
House #1 is a $100,000 420 square foot log cabin that comes with 25 acres of land. It has one bedroom and one "sort of" bathroom, the realtor's words, not mine.
The living room is, as expected, tiny.
Dan loves the stove, but Cindy is rightly concerned about the stove when they have two-year-olds. This is the house's only source of heat, which I'm sure is super great in the winter.
The twins can sleep in the dual sink.
The kitchen is, as expected, tiny. The sink uses rainwater that is collected in a big bucket outside and this house has no public utilities; the electricity is from a generator.
I really wanted Dan to get Clark Griswald-ed here.
The only bedroom is a sleeping loft. Dan thinks the kids will love the stairs to the bedroom. I think he doesn't know his kids.
I think this is the room Charlie's family from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory slept in.
Dan, Cindy, and the four kids would all have to sleep in this one room. Apparently Dan and Cindy plan on not having sex again.
The "sort of" bathroom is, in fact, an outhouse. Well, the Tennessee Valley Authority didn't extend to New York state. Dan says, "The adventure aspect is kind of appealing to me," but I think that you don't drag your family to a home with an outhouse because you want to go all Walden.
Walden by Thoreau Cartman
I also just realized that they never explained how one showers in this home.
House #2 is a 1 bed, 1 bath 620 square foot house for $44,900. This house is close to Cindy's family.
The house is very dated and kind of tragic-looking.
You can do laundry as you eat dinner.
The dining room is between the living room and the kitchen and has the house's laundry hook-up.
The bathroom is, as expected, tiny. Cindy doesn't like that you have to walk sideways past the toilet, but I don't know why you'd expect a particularly big bathroom in a house this size.
A very Brady bedroom
The only bedroom in the house is, as expected, tiny.
The tiny bedroom's closet is, as expected, tiny, but Cindy says, "That's a tiny closet," as if that's not what she expected. "Life would be all about getting rid of some clothes, that's for sure." Did they not plan anything out past, "Let's move into a tiny house with our kids because they're growing up and we don't like that they're becoming more independent and are comfortable spending time by themselves"? Why the hell would you think you could keep all or most of your stuff when you move into a house that's a quarter of the size of your current home?
This would make a great bedroom.
The entrance to the attic is through the bedroom's closet and they think this would make a great bedroom for the older girls. I'm starting to think they hate their kids.
The kitchen has carpet, which is somehow even grosser than a bathroom with carpet. They don't think the kitchen makes good use of the space, which is true.
House #3 is a 1 bed, 1 bath 657 square foot house for $72,900. Cindy loves that is looks like a cottage. I agree that it's a cute house, but it would make a pretty sad-ass cottage.
This is the nicest and the largest house they've seen so far. It even has a nice front door.
The dining room is off the living room, but they don't think it would be big enough for a table of six. I can't believe a 1-bedroom house doesn't have a dining room with a table big enough for six.
This house also has the best kitchen of all three.
But Dan, a person who seriously considered a home with an outhouse, gets oddly picky about the kitchen cabinets and says that he doesn't like that they've been painted a few times and that he thinks they would have to replace them.
The same color scheme as the 1980's game show based on the board game Scrabble.
The only bedroom is very brightly colored and it makes me want to know more about who lived here before.
They check out the bathroom and, again, it's the nicest of the bunch. Cindy says, "It'll be a lot to get used to six people in one bathroom." Again, was this not something they had already considered?
There's a second floor with an open space that they say could be divided into two spaces for all the kids. Again, it's the nicest of the bunch.
Cindy and Dan discuss the three houses they've seen while eating pizza at Cindy's mom's house. That pizza looks terrible.
House #1 is the log cabin Dan wants, but it's over budget and IT DOES NOT HAVE A BATHROOM, JUST AN OUTHOUSE! How is this possibly up for consideration?
House #2 is way under budget but is terrible.
House #3 is close to their max budget and they're going to have to get new kitchen cabinets, but even so, it's the nicest of all three...so of course they don't pick this one
They pick house #2.
It's move-in day, but they're not having the whole family move in until after the school year ends, so they facetime them.
The secret to higher earnings for women? Marry a POOR man: How your pick of partner affects your paycheck
Women whose husbands earn less than $100,000 tend to make more money than those married to wealthier men
But the greatest impact on a woman's ambitions is caused by time off to have children
Women who marry 'poorer' spouses make more money over time, while those who have higher-earning husbands take home less, new research has found.
Economists who tracked University of Chicago MBA graduates for more than a decade discovered that choice of partner is an important factor in a woman's earning power.
But Quartz reports that the life choice that has the greatest impact on high-achieving women's ambitions is the career interruption caused by maternity leave.
Working woman: Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg claims that the most important decision a woman will make is choosing a partner who will support her success
Marianne Bertrand, Claudia Goldin, and Lawrence Katz concluded that 'the presence of children is the main contributor to the lesser job experience, greater career discontinuity, and shorter work hours for female MBAs'.
The researchers write that 'any career interruption - a period of six months or more out of work - is costly in terms of future earnings'. The fraction of men who had time out is 4per cent per year after graduation, and 10per cent 10 years out.
But 41per cent of women has had at least one such interruption 10 years after graduation, mainly due to maternity leave.
'The presence of children is the main contributor to the lesser job experience, greater career discontinuity, and shorter work hours for female MBAs'
The study also found that the impact having children has on a woman's career is directly tied to spousal income.
Women who had both a high-earning husband and children experienced the largest dip in income after giving birth, while the effect on those with spouses earning $100,000 or less was much less pronounced.
In addition, many MBA-qualified mothers seem to actively choose careers that are more family-oriented, while at the same time avoiding jobs with longer hours and greater career advancement possibilities.
Gender gap: Researchers explored the reasons behind the difference in high-achieving men and women's earnings over a decade
Among ambitious couples struggling for work-life balance, the message is clear: Someone's career often has to take a hit, and it's usually the lower earner.
Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in Lean In, her book about women in the workforce, that 'the single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she will have a life partner and who that partner is'.
Washington (CNN) Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina -- who is the only African-American Republican in U.S. Senate -- delivered an emotional floor speech Wednesday about the unfair police scrutiny he has faced over his life because he is a black man.
"In the course of one year, I've been stopped seven times by law enforcement," Scott said. "Not four, not five, not six, but seven times in one year as an elected official."
The speech was the second of three the conservative first-term senator is delivering this week related to the fatal shootings of two African-American men by white police officers and the sniper attack that killed five Dallas police officers by a black man angry over police mistreatment of African-Americans.
Scott described this speech as "the most difficult because it is the most personal."
"In many cities and towns across America, there is a deep divide between the black community and law enforcement. A trust gap, a tension that has been growing for decades. And as a family, one American family, we cannot ignore these issues," Scott said.
"I can certainly remember the very first time that I was pulled over by a police officer as just a youngster. I was driving a car that had an improper headlight," Scott said. "The cop came over to my car, hand on his gun and said, 'Boy, don't you know your headlight is not working properly?' I felt embarrassed, ashamed, and scared, very scared."
Holding up two fingers, Scott said there were times when he was pulled over that he was speeding.
"But the vast majority of the time I was pulled over for nothing more than driving a new car in the wrong neighborhood or some other reason just as trivial," he said.
Scott described drawing the attention of a police officer once as he drove out of a shopping mall. The cop pulled right behind Scott and followed him as he drove home, taking three left turns along the way.
"Finally, I took a fourth left coming into my apartment complex and then the blue lights went on. The officer approached the car and said that I did not -- I did not use my turn signal on the fourth turn," Scott said. "Do you really think that somehow I forgot to use my turn signal on the fourth turn?"
Another time Scott says he was pulled over by an officer who accused him of stealing the car he was driving. The senator recounted how his brother, who was a high-ranking enlisted man in the Army, was accused of the same thing when he was driving home one day in a Volvo.
Scott also described the plight of a former staffer who sold his "nice car" because he was so "tired of being targeted" by suspicious police.
"Imagine the frustration, the irritation, the sense of loss of dignity that accompanies each of those stops, even here on Capitol Hill," Scott said.
Scott said he has even faced problems with U.S. Capitol Police as he has arrived at work. The officers are trained to recognize all lawmakers but Scott said he has faced "attitude" and forced to show his identification to get in. On three separate occasions, he has received calls of apology from a supervisor or the chief of the Capitol Police over the way he was treated, Scott said.
In his speech, Scott also praised police and the dangerous work they do.
"There is never, ever an acceptable reason to harm a member of our law enforcement community," he said.
At the end of his speech, Scott pleaded with Americans who don't face racism not to ignore the plight of those who do.
"Recognize that just because you do not feel the pain, the anguish of another, does not mean it does not exist. To ignore their struggles, our struggles, does not make them disappear. It simply leaves you blind and the American family very vulnerable," he said.
"Some search so hard to explain away injustice that they are slowly wiping away who we are as a nation. But we must come together to fulfill what we all know is possible here in America: Peace, love, and understanding. Fairness," Scott said.
A son struggling to deal with his father's death in a fatal fire has been forced to assume another burden: that some people in the community believe his dad's cigarette may have sparked the inferno.
Authorities have said 10 people are confirmed dead while 22 others are unaccounted for and are believed to have died in the fast-moving blaze that consumed the Residence du Havre in the Quebec community of L'Isle-Verte. Premier Pauline Marois cut short a trip to Europe to be in the small village of 1,500 on Sunday.
Jean-Andre Michaud's father, Paul-Etienne, 96, was among those who vanished in Thursday's fire and are believed to be entombed in mounds of rubble and thick slabs of ice.
But as Jean-Andre, 68, tries to mourn the loss of his dad, people in the community have begun to believe one of his father's cigarettes may have triggered the disaster.
He has faced questions about this possibility from police investigators and journalists. A media report has also led the town, including members of his extended family, to believe it all began with the cherry of his father's cigarette.
TVA quoted the building's night watchman on Friday as saying he believes the blaze was caused by a lit cigarette in the section of the building where Paul-Etienne Michaud lived.
An emotional Jean-Andre Michaud said in an interview Saturday at his farmhouse that he's not buying the argument his father might have started the fire, even though he acknowledged his dad was, at times, a determined smoker.
“My father smoked a bit, but would he get up in the middle of the night to go for a smoke?” he said as a tear rolled down his cheek inside the house where his father was born, just outside town.
“No, it's impossible… It would be a bitter pill to swallow to start saying, ‘Look, your father started the fire'…
“It's not my father, leave me in peace, damn it.”
Jean-Andre Michaud discussed his father's lifelong smoking habit, which he said only amounted to about a pack of cigarettes per week.
But he also described how his father, well-known in the family for his stubborn streak, would sometimes go to great lengths to get his fix.
He said his dad had been caught lighting up inside the seniors' residence a couple of times shortly after the building became smoke-free a few years back.
Jean-Andre Michaud also said his dad had his own makeshift smoking shack in the residence's parking lot: an old, rusted jalopy.
It would be a bitter pill to swallow to start saying, ‘Look, your father started the fire'
In colder weather, he said, his father would climb into his beat-up, undrivable minivan to smoke. The vehicle became a more-permanent fixture last summer after his son removed two of its wheels, so that his licence-less, elderly father could no longer take it for rides around town.
“You can see that the windows are pretty much tinted [from the tobacco stains],” Jean-Andre Michaud said of the minivan.
An employee at the residence told The Canadian Press she often saw Paul-Etienne Michaud, who lived at the home since its 1997 opening, head out to the lot to smoke in his vehicle.
The staffer said the elder Michaud was one of only two smokers she was aware of who lived in the building.
The employee also shed some light on details that emerged during the TVA interview with the building's night watchman, Bruno Belanger.
Belanger said the fire started in Room 206.
The employee, however, said the room had been empty since December, when the last tenant moved to another part of the residence.
Jean-Andre Michaud said his father lived in Room 208 and that he had been there for several years.
“My father was in 208, damn it, not in 206 — and people are saying the fire started in 206,” he said.
Jean-Andre added that the confusion over the room numbers had led people to believe his father's cigarette was to blame. He was not specifically asked about the possibility of whether the vacant Room 206 could have been used as a discreet smoking area.
Meanwhile, other family members have discussed the possibility among themselves that one of their own might be connected to the fire, said Paul-Etienne Michaud's niece.
Lucie Michaud, who lives in the neighbouring village of St-Eloi, said immediately after she heard about the tragedy she thought something as banal as a cigarette could be the cause.
It wasn't long after that when she thought of her uncle.
“My uncle was probably, as I was saying, smoking secretly in the room,” she said at her house along the hamlet's main street.
“He wanted to smoke one last one before going to bed, but it was his last one.”
But she came to the defence of her family and her uncle, whom she said had become quite forgetful in recent years and didn't even recognize her when she saw him for the last time in the summer.
She said if her uncle's cigarette truly caused the blaze it would have been just a terrible mistake.
“At this age, he was not even aware that what he was doing could cause harm,” she said.
“You can't dishonour a family based on someone who was not even aware of what he was doing.”
Lucie Michaud said provincial police investigators phoned her house in hope of tracking down her uncle's relatives, including Jean-Andre Michaud.
Jean-Andre Michaud said the officers came to the family dairy farm to ask about his father's smoking habit.
“The police asked me if he smoked and things like that,” said Jean-Andre Michaud, one of three surviving siblings out of his father's seven children.
Police, however, refused to say Saturday if they thought a resident's cigarette might have ignited the fire, as they fielded reporters' questions on the subject.
“For us right now there are a few hypotheses that we're looking at — what was mentioned in the media [Friday] is one of them,” Lt. Guy Lapointe said in an interview.
“But it's not the only one, and for us right now, it's really too early to state that the cause of the fire was a cigarette.”
Jean-Andre Michaud said it would be another burden for the grieving family if, in fact, authorities determine that his father's cigarette started the fire.
“It's the way he went and they haven't even found him yet,” he said, adding he hopes his dad's death is confirmed soon.
“I would have at least like to be told that he's gone.”
Opposition to a deal hit 69 per cent of Party member respondents last July, reached a new peak of 74 per cent in December…and climbs to 78 per cent this month. 18 per cent of these respondents want a pact – that's a record low to match the record high of those that don't.
The results for a pre-election deal with the Liberal Democrats barely flicker. Five per cent are for it, 91 per cent are against.
This loyalist rally to the Party's election standard is to be expected. Indeed, it is so predictable that I'm tempted to scrap the question altogether. However, if the polls don't move it may be best to keep an open mind about running it for one last time next month.
The question of pacts or deals with either party – and others, such as the Democratic Unionists – will become live after the election if the result replicates the average of present polls (which of course it may not).
Almost 750 Party members replied to the survey, which is tested against a control panel that was originally supplied by YouGov. It may be worth noting that these respondents find the question worth answering: only seven skipped it.
A US court has passed two landmark rulings in which animals were given the same basic rights as humans.
Lawmakers in the state of Oregon hope the moves will make it easier for police officers to help animals in danger, and could see people who abuse or neglect animals face harsher punishments.
It could also make it harder for defendants to expunge convictions from their criminal records years later, The Oregonian reported.

“These are hugely helpful to the prosecution of animal-cruelty cases,” Jacob Kamins, a prosecutor assigned to pursuing animal cases across Oregon, told the newspaper.
In both cases, defendants had argued that state laws define animals as the property of their owners.
In one case dating back to 2009, the supreme court ruled that a man from Umatilla County who starved 20 horses and goats on his property should be sentenced in a way which regarded each animal as a “victim”.
Prior to the ruling, defendant Arnold Nix argued that the law defines animals as the “non-human” property of their owners, so the word “victim” would not apply.
In the second case, the state's high court ruled a sheriff's deputy was legally justified in stepping on to private land and taking an extremely malnourished horse to a vet because acquiring a warrant could have taken a number of hours, by which point the horse may have died.
While the high court agreed that animals are still defined by law as “property”, it ruled that police needed to act quickly to prevent harm to people or to property.
“To acknowledge that animals are victims of crime, that's really common sense to us,” Lora Dunn, staff attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund in Portland, told the newspaper.
She added that while the charity recommends that police obtain a warrant to avoid “constitutional issues down the line”, the ruling was important in saving the lives of animals.

2,200 people mark 45th anniversary of reversion by holding rally to call for an Okinawa without military bases
May 15, 2017 Ryukyu Shimpo
On May 15, Okinawa reached the milestone of 45 years of reversion to Japan from U.S. occupation.
Okinawans have aspired to make their islands free of military bases, but have still not realized their dream.
The Japanese government is forcibly constructing a new base in Henoko, Nago, as a part of the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan.
On May 14, the day before marking the 45th anniversary of reversion, on the beach of Sedake, Nago, from where protesters can see the construction site, the 5.1 Peace March Execution Committee and the Okinawa Peace Movement Center held a rally.
According to the organizers, about 2,200 people took part, holding up their fists in protest against the construction of the new base.
Hiroji Yamashiro, chairperson of the Okinawa Peace Movement Center said, “We will not lose, we will not allow any bases to be built anywhere in the prefecture and will block the path to war. We will scram with the people of Miyako and Yaeyama Islands.”
Nago Mayor Susumu Inamine said, “We must start the struggle to take back democracy and local autonomy of Okinawa and Japan, just now on Sedake Beach. I will hold on to my belief in not allowing the government to build the new base in the sea of Henoko.”
The rally participants adopted a declaration expressing strong opposition to the strengthening and expansion of the U.S. military and Japanese Self-Defence Forces (SDF)' bases promoted by the governments of Japan and the United States. It referred to the SDF's unit deployment to Miyako and Yaeyama.
Participants marched about two kilometers to the Wansaka Oura Park and repeated “Gambaro!” three times at the end.

Jill Stein - the Green Party candidate in the recent US election campaign - has launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund recounts in a number of states.
The Stein campaign is calling for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - all key battleground states in which President-elect Donald Trump is estimated to have won by less than 1% (the final official tallies have yet to be declared in a majority of states).
It's official: Jill Stein announces plans to file for a recount in PA, MI & WI. From her release: pic.twitter.com/Yh0gcVBPOR — Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) November 23, 2016
On the Stein crowdfunding page, the description suggests they are "three states where the data suggests a significant need to verify machine-counted vote totals".
The campaign is looking to raise $2.5m by this coming Friday to meet deadlines for applying for recounts.
In a statement, Dr Stein said: "After a divisive and painful presidential race, in which foreign agents hacked into party databases, private email servers, and voter databases in certain states, many Americans are wondering if our election results are reliable.
"That's why the unexpected results of the election and reported anomalies need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified. We deserve elections we can trust."
As of writing, the campaign had raised more than $400,000.
Stein herself is estimated to have won just over 1% of the popular vote in the election.
The crowdfunding effort follows media reports over the last 24 hours suggesting that Hillary Clinton's campaign is being lobbied to call for a recount.
New York Magazine last night reported that a team of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers "believes they've found persuasive evidence that results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked".
J Alex Halderman - Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan - suggested that some of the information in the New York article "incorrectly describes the reasons manually checking ballots is an essential security safeguard (and includes some incorrect numbers, to boot)".
He wrote in a blog post: "Examining the physical evidence in these states”Š - ”Ševen if it finds nothing amiss”Š - ”Šwill help allay doubt and give voters justified confidence that the results are accurate.
"It will also set a precedent for routinely examining paper ballots, which will provide an important deterrent against cyberattacks on future elections. Recounting the ballots now can only lead to strengthened electoral integrity, but the window for candidates to act is closing fast," he adds.
An analysis on polling site FiveThirtyEight, however, suggests that "demographics, not hacking, explain the election results".
As part of our 2016 season of events, we invited four of our favourite professional talkers - John Campbell, Carol Hirschfeld, Wallace Chapman and Noelle McCarthy - to share the moments that have left them speechless, for better and for worse.
Their stories were wild, strange, uncensored and beautiful. There were youthful fuck-ups and clumsy cover-ups. There were stubborn silences that stretched years until they became warped beyond recognition, and there were devastating, difficult encounters where words felt feeble and insufficient.
Thanks to everyone who came along to Dead Air - all profit from this event went towards paying our amazing writers - and thanks to our partner RNZ who'll be broadcasting these stories over the summer, albeit with a little censoring.

Though their family has experienced rocky times over the past year, the Duggar children say their faith in marriage remains unchanged.
“Even though all this happened, we still want the same things moving forward,” Jana Duggar, 26, tells PEOPLE in this week's issue, which features the Duggars opening up about life following a cheating scandal involving their brother Josh. “You're not going to marry a ‘perfect' person; we aren't perfect ourselves!”
From left to right: Joy-Anna, Jinger and Jana Duggar Larsen & Talbert
And the ladies have an idea of what attributes they would like in an ideal husband.
“I think we would want someone like our dad [Jim Bob] – someone who is a strong leader and who loves God and loves others more than himself,” says Joy, 18.

Though the Duggar daughters have seen sisters Jessa (Duggar) Seewald and Jill (Duggar) Dillard get married, they aren't in a hurry to follow suit.
“We aren't anxious about get ting married. But when you meet a boy, you examine their character,” says Jinger, 22.
The Duggar family is soon returning to TV with the first full season of TLC's Jill and Jessa: Counting On. The series premieres March 15 at 9 p.m. ET on TLC.
PROBLEM: Even when both ceiling lights are on in the kitchen, the sink has always been too dark at night. Anyone standing at the sink creates a shadow from the ceiling light, making it tough to properly wash dishes or vegetables.
SOLUTION: Install a light above the sink.
BONUS ROUND: Build the light from parts I already had, and make it automatically turn itself on and off.
I decided to build it using stuff from around the house. Of course, this isn't just any house...this is a geek house! So the components below were naturally considered household items. I decided to use an ATtiny84 as the heart of the project. It's way under-utilized here, but I didn't have any ATtiny25s in stock. I could have used a 555 instead of a microcontroller, but then I wouldn't have gotten a cool fade-in and fade-out PWM effect. Plus the 555 at one minute or higher time scales is a little ungainly, with the high value capacitor required. And I REALLY wanted a smooth fade-in. I would have also needed to invert the trigger signal from the PIR sensor.
Parts list:
PIR Motion Sensor
ATtiny84
16 100mA white 10mm LEDs
LM340T-5.0 regulator
IRF612 MOSFET (not ideal, but works)
Old RadioShack proto board (do they even still sell those?)
10uF capacitor
0.1uF capacitor
4 39ohm resistors
~15V DC power supply
Wire and solder
Poster board
Zip ties
The schematic: Here's a quick schematic of the build. Very simple. The IRF612 is not really a logic level FET, but for the current we're using it's not a big problem. Threshold for Vgs is 2-4 volts, so 5V is okay. I'd have used a better FET if I had one around, but this doesn't even warm up as-is. Didn't bother with a series or pulldown resistor here.
Coding: This project was partly spurred by downloading Atmel's new AVR Studio 5. It's based on Visual Studio 2010, it's a bloated 500+ MB download, it's proprietary, it's Windows-only...but it is a really nice way to write code. Obviously the more complex programs will benefit from all the code exploration features in AVR Studio 5, but Intellisense is always welcome on even the smallest projects. AVR Studio 4 felt a lot closer to the hardware, but I'm sure that was infuriating for the developers using the larger processors.
The code simply watches the input from the PIR sensor, maintains a few counters and fades the PWM up and down accordingly. It is set to keep the light on as long as there is activity, or 60 seconds since the last activity. Accuracy is not really needed, so the internal 8MHz oscillator was selected using the AVR fuse configuration tool in AVR Studio.

The build: Construction is embarrassingly simple, should be considered temporary until it falls apart. The main structural component is white foamcore poster board, with some packing tape and hot glue and a couple zip ties to keep things together. Holes were punched for the LEDs and the PIR sensor dome, then everything was hot glued in place.
The installation: The resulting light bar was installed over the kitchen sink using some 3M Command hooks and a couple zip ties. Everything works as advertised! Approach the sink and the light will fade on. As long as motion events are captured in the PIR sensor range (washing dishes, etc) the light will stay on. If there is no activity for 60 seconds, it will fade off.
Four distinct Marvel superhero series culminated on Aug. 18 at midnight when “The Defenders” dropped on Netflix, and signs point to its smash success.
But with only eight episodes ― five fewer than usual ― it's tempting to think about what the series that encompasses “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones,” “Luke Cage” and “Iron Fist” could've done with a little more time. (We could've stuck around to watch Danny Rand try to talk to Jessica Jones about “chi” for a while, but that's us.)
The “Defenders” showrunner Marco Ramirez could have produced a few more episodes. The problem, he told HuffPost, was a classic filming conundrum: All the actors were only available to shoot for a limited time.
“The eight-episode structure was, creatively, what I thought would work. But there was also the logistical question, which was: We needed to be able to free up Krysten and Mike to go shoot the second seasons of their shows,” Ramirez said. “So by the end of production, we all felt like we could shoot another couple of these. But we had to release them back to their own shows.”
Netflix hasn't announced whether “Defenders” will get a second installment, although “Daredevil” is getting a Season 3, “Jessica,” “Luke” and “Iron Fist” are each getting a Season 2, and the streaming service is gearing up for a separate “Punisher” series. The odds seem good. And luckily, Ramirez seems to have leftover ideas in spades.
“Not only are there pairings that I would like to see a little bit more of, but there are relationships that we already have that I wish I was able to work on more, or to make more scenes happen,” he said.
“I wish there were more one-on-one Danny-Luke scenes. I wish there was more opportunity to do more one-on-one Matt-Jessica scenes, or even flip-flopping those interactions, Jessica-Danny or Luke-Matt. But we had to build a story, we had to make up as many combinations as possible, and I think in those eight episodes ― in the laundry list of checking off all the dream pairings and dream teams ― we managed to fit a lot of them into our show, and I'm really proud of that.”
The characters have cropped up in each other's seasons before, and the showrunner suggested that “cross-pollination” of the different Marvel characters would continue throughout the Netflix shows.
With “Punisher” rumored to debut in late fall, at least there won't be too long to wait.
A shocking new expose' video has caught Planned Parenthood's top doctor describing how the abortion business sells the body parts of aborted babies.
New undercover footage shows Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Senior Director of Medical Services, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, describing how Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted unborn children and admitting she uses partial-birth abortions to supply intact body parts.
In the video, Nucatola is at a business lunch with actors posing as buyers from a human biologics company. As head of PPFA's Medical Services department, Nucatola has overseen medical practice at all Planned Parenthood locations since 2009. She also trains new Planned Parenthood abortion doctors and performs abortions herself at Planned Parenthood Los Angeles up to 24 weeks.
(Watch the FULL two-hour video at the end of this article).
Nucatola admits that Planned Parenthood charges per-specimen for baby body parts, uses illegal partial-birth abortion procedures in order to get salable parts, and is aware of their own liability for doing so and takes steps to cover it up.
The footage shockingly depicts the top medical official at the Planned Parenthood corporation munching on her salad while she discusses the sale of body parts of unborn children victimized by abortions. She brazenly describes how the heads of unborn babies killed in abortions command top dollar.
SIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must Investigate Planned Parenthood for Selling Aborted Baby Parts
The buyers ask Nucatola, “How much of a difference can that actually make, if you know kind of what's expected, or what we need?”
“It makes a huge difference,” Nucatola replies. “I'd say a lot of people want liver. And for that reason, most providers will do this case under ultrasound guidance, so they'll know where they're putting their forceps. The kind of rate-limiting step of the procedure is calvarium. Calvarium—the head—is basically the biggest part.”
Nucatola explains, “We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm gonna basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna see if I can get it all intact.”
“And with the calvarium, in general, some people will actually try to change the presentation so that it's not vertex,” she continues. “So if you do it starting from the breech presentation, there's dilation that happens as the case goes on, and often, the last step, you can evacuate an intact calvarium at the end.”

Federal law prohibits the sale of body parts of aborted babies. In fact, the sale or purchase of human fetal tissue a federal felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 (42 U.S.C. 289g-2).
Nucatola also reveals that Planned Parenthood's national office is concerned about their liability for the sale of fetal parts.
“At the national office, we have a Litigation and Law Department which just really doesn't want us to be the middle people for this issue right now,” she says. “But I will tell you that behind closed doors these conversations are happening with the affiliates.”
A separate clip shows Planned Parenthood President and CEO Cecile Richards praising Nucatola's work to facilitate connections for fetal tissue collection. “Oh good,” Richards says when told about Nucatola's support for fetal tissue collection at Planned Parenthood, “Great. She's amazing.”
The video is the first by The Center for Medical Progress in its “Human Capital” series, a nearly 3-year-long investigative journalism study of Planned Parenthood's illegal trafficking of aborted fetal parts.
The head of the project, David Daleiden, reacted to the shocking footage his team captured: “Planned Parenthood's criminal conspiracy to make money off of aborted baby parts reaches to the very highest levels of their organization. Elected officials must listen to the public outcry for Planned Parenthood to be held accountable to the law and for our tax dollars to stop underwriting this barbaric abortion business.”
Operation Rescue President Troy Newman serves on the Board of Daleiden's Center for Medical Progress. During this investigation, Newman advised Daleiden, providing consultation services and material support.
“Abortionists use ultrasound like a butcher uses scales to sell meat by the pound for profit,” said Newman in an email to LifeNews. “Evidence further shows that Planned Parenthood has gone to great lengths to keep the public from ever knowing about their illicit human body-parts trade, understanding that if news were to leak, it could spell doom for the abortion giant.”

The Packers announced their biggest move earlier on Saturday when they released guard Josh Sitton and they got around to announcing the rest on Saturday evening.
The most notable thing about the other cuts is that the Packers don't currently have a long snapper on their roster. They released Rick Lovato, which means that one of the 53 guys that remain on the roster will likely be departing in the coming days so that they can fill that hole.
There are also only five defensive linemen, so there are multiple areas where the Packers might be looking to shuffle the deck.
They do have three quarterbacks on hand as preseason workhorse Joe Callahan made it through cuts to join Aaron Rodgers and Brett Hundley. Center Corey Linsley was placed on the reserve/physically unable to perform list due to a hamstring injury.
Quarterback Marquise Williams was among the cuts, as were veteran linebackers Sam Barrington and Carl Bradford. They were joined by wide receivers Geronimo Allison and Herb Waters; linebackers Beniquez Brown and Reggie Gilbert; cornerbacks Robertson Daniel and Warren Gatewood; running backs Brandon Ross and Alstevis Squirewell; defensive tackle Brian Price; guard Lucas Patrick; tight end Casey Pierce; and safety Jermaine Whitehead.
Defensive tackle Tyler Kuder and center Kyle Steuck are headed to injured reserve and cornerback Demetri Goodson and defensive tackle Mike Pennell will serve supensions to start the year.
Fanconi anemia is a rare, inherited disorder that affects about one in 350,000 births. It affects the blood and bone marrow and many other organs, can cause physical abnormalities and vulnerability to cancer. Recently, the case of a child with serious Fanconi-like symptoms has helped researchers at The Rockefeller University in New York and UC Davis better understand the causes of the disease, and discover a new role for a protein already known to be involved in DNA repair and protection from cancer. The work was published recently in the journal Molecular Cell.
Rockefeller University maintains an international registry of people with Fanconi anemia or similar conditions, with the goal of helping researchers understand what causes the disease. Some 18 genes have been linked to Fanconi anemia, all involved in repair of “interstrand crosslinks” where two strands of DNA get stuck together. These crosslinks can be caused by chemicals generated during normal cell metabolism, by anticancer drugs and alcohol metabolism, and they can cause serious damage to DNA if not quickly removed.
Agata Smogorzewska and colleagues at the Rockefeller looked at the case of a child born with Fanconi anemia-like symptoms, identified through the registry. Sequencing of the child's genome showed that she did not have any of the known genetic mutations linked to the condition. She did have just one unusual mutation in one of two copies of the gene for
RAD51, a protein involved in a different DNA repair process. This was something of a puzzle, because generally one “good” copy of a gene is sufficient for normal cellular functions. Neither of the girl's parents had the mutation or symptoms.
Working in cell lines, Smogorzewska's group was able to show that introducing this mutation made cells vulnerable to DNA damage from interstrand crosslinks, and cutting it out of the patient's cell lines “cured” the problem in those cells.
They then turned to Professor Stephen Kowalczykowski at UC Davis, whose laboratory has extensively studied RAD51 and other related proteins involved in DNA repair. Kowalczykowski's lab has shown, for example, how RAD51 plays a crucial role in homologous recombination, in which missing DNA is repaired by using the matching DNA strand as a template. RAD51 forms a filament with single-stranded DNA to line up with its sister DNA molecule and begin the copying process.
Taeho Kim, a postdoctoral researcher in Kowalczykowski's lab, purified the protein made by the mutated gene and carried out biochemical studies to see how it functioned both in repairing interstrand crosslinks and in homologous recombination.
“It was evident right away that it was altered, and altered in a very unique way,” he said.
Not only does the mutant RAD51 protein not work properly, but it poisons the ability of the healthy protein made by the normal copy of the gene to deal with crosslinks, Kowalczykowski said.
The patient is only alive at all, although with severe disabilities, because she has one good copy of the gene, Kowalczykowski said, and her cells contain higher levels of the normal than the mutant protein.
“In this patient, DNA repair is normal, but protection from crosslinks is not, and we don't completely understand why,” he said.
The discovery could open up new studies of interstrand crosslink repair, Kowalczykowski said. This is an important type of DNA damage whose repair is still not well understood.
The new mutant gene, designated FANCR, is the first example of a “co-dominant” DNA repair gene in homologous recombination in humans. While, for simplicity, genetic counselors often think of genes as being completely “dominant” or “recessive,” real mutations are more subtle, Kowalczykowski noted. In this case, the FANCR mutation partially poisons RAD51's function, but not completely. Kowalczykowski's lab has previously discovered co-dominant mutations in bacterial genes – notably in the protein RecA, which is the equivalent of RAD51 in E. coli bacteria.
Kowalczykowski predicted that many more such co-dominant mutations would be found in human DNA repair, potentially making it harder to unravel the causes of disease and making genetic counseling more difficult.
In addition to UC Davis and the Rockefeller, the authors include researchers at the University of Minnesota, the Broad Institute and the New York Genome Center.

News article from The Rockefeller University
Wouldn't it be lovely if everybody had a pony? The gentle clip clop of its hooves on the roadway would be heaven. The swishing of the tail and the gentle up and down motion would be a delightful way to destress after a long hard week of work, and besides, decreasing stress makes one healthier, no? In fact, I think the Ontario Ministry of Health should at once buy every person in Ontario a pony to combat heart disease, and the effect on high blood pressure and the decrease in heart attacks would be worth it!
Last week, I was pointed toward a policy statement by Green Party of Canada leader Elizabeth May where a commenter had suggested that the government should fund complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and that this would somehow save costs for the health care system. I had responded to the commenter with a statement about the lack of evidence for naturopathy, which was a system of medicine overwhelmingly supported by the other commenters, and that there was no evidence at all to support the notion that public funding of CAM would save money. This is not a new suggestion, however, and if this presentation at the IN-CAM Research Symposium in Toronto in November is any indication, this is just the beginning of the discussion of whether Canadian public health insurance plans should cover CAM treatments.
I had a notion that my response on the Green Party website was correct, but I had not reviewed the literature. Risking madness, I decided to take a quick look at the trends in economic research and CAM and see if my notion was correct. Let me first suggest that there are a few ways that CAM could save money and convince me that the government should fund it. The first way was if it was able to prevent the onset disease better than conventional medicine and do so for less money. The second would be if it was able to stop progression of disease with fewer risks, and do so for less money than conventional medicine. The third way would be to save money and resources by diverting the “worried well”, those with a self-limiting condition that would most likely get better on their own, from conventional physicians and save the resource for patients with acute need.
The first question is a more complex one than it looks on the surface. There are several ideas promoted by CAM providers as that are actually also under the purview of conventional medicine and public health. Good nutrition, regular exercise, healthy and adequate sleep patterns and stress reduction are all advice your doctor can give you and is a component of medical training and research. It is however an important question as to whether CAM providers are better at communicating wellness plans and disease prevention than physicians and other mainstream medical workers. Unfortunately, I could find no direct comparisons so there is no way we can answer this question definitively. What is clear, is that CAM providers often spend more time with the patient in regular office visits, and this gives them a much greater opportunity to communicate disease prevention information than physicians. If we could adopt a similar model, or have physician's assistants or nurses/nurse practitioners detailed to this work, it could be accomplished as a part of regular visits. This report from the Society for Medical Anthropology discussed in detail this question and they do not have satisfying answers. We just don't have enough data to determine if CAM for prevention is better and saves money, and more research is needed to determine this, if we are going to start paying for it as a society.
The second question is a bit easier to answer, as we have comprehensive reviews of the research in major CAM areas such as acupuncture, chiropractic (see also here, here, here, and here), homeopathy and naturopathy that review their ability to care for acute and chronic health issues. They have not fared well when using the randomized controlled trial (RCT) which has led CAM researchers to call for a different approach that will get them the results that they desire: the patient-reported-outcomes (PRO) model. The PRO uses qualitative and subjective reports by the patient of their well-being instead of controlling for variables. This paper lays out this point of view and requires its own blog post to deconstruct, but suffice it to say it disregards RCT's as effective for analyzing CAM. The author, Ireh Iyioha from the Faculty of Law at the University of British Columbia puts it this way:
“…the concept of evidence-based medicine looms largely at the centre of discrediting CAM, and it is, therefore, fundamental in the barriers to the recognition of this form of medicine.”
CAM has largely lost the evidence battle when it comes to its ability to treat disease and has retreated instead to the anecdotal evidence of its adherents and those with a vested interest in believing that CAM works, namely those who pay for it. We cannot take this as evidence (although this homeopathy researcher even goes so far as to call the skepticism scientists have of homeopathy based on basic principles of science “plausibility bias” . More in depth discussion at Science Based Medicine).
So there is very little if any evidence that CAM can cure disease, either chronic or acute, but what about the last question? Can we use CAM practitioners to ease the burden of the “worried well” on an over-worked medical system? Most visits to CAM practitioners, as described in this study were for chronic conditions, with the greatest number being for fatigue, headache and back pain: non-specific conditions that mainstream medicine does not have easy answers to. In fact the National Health Service of the U.K.'s NICE guidelines for low back pain lasting more than 6 weeks suggest that manual therapies, including the spinal manipulation offered by chiropractors and osteopaths, be suggested by physicians as part of the treatment plan (despite evidence that the effects are only temporary). I will agree that if the guidelines suggest a procedure as part of a normal treatment plan, it should be covered by the government. The problem is that chiropractors are not only offering manual therapies for low back pain, they are offering unsupportable treatments for such things as infantile colic and ear infections in children and heart disease in adults; none of which have any support when the evidence is looked at on the whole (colic, ear infection, heart disease) and which should therefore not get any support from the public purse.
When we look at the bigger picture, several studies have tried to review CAM as a whole to see if it makes economic sense to fund. They may be the best way to answer the final question of whether CAM helps with low-risk chronic conditions that none-the-less are a burden on a person's quality of life. Acupuncture and manual therapies seem to be the most reviewed, perhaps because that is where the most data lies. A systematic review from the University of Ottawa showed no improvement in the medium or long term in low back pain and neck pain with either accupunture or various manual therapies. It is a comprehensive study that compared these therapies to both normal treatment, sham CAM treatment and doing nothing, and came up emtpy.
I found five reviews that discussed the cost efficiency of all CAM therapies and all but one found that there is not enough evidence to warrent drawing a conclusion that CAM is cost-effective. The studies done thus far, and 3 of the reviews were from 2012, are not sufficient, have different units of measure, are not applicable outside of the context of the country it was done in, and are not clear enough to recommend paying for CAM as a whole. With the exception of low back pain, the evidence is poor (1,2,3,4,5) This study found decreased insurance expenditures in patients using CAM for fibromyalgia, back pain and menopause syndromes, which is not surprising, given the subjective nature of the symptoms, the frustration with mainstream medical solutions to these problems, and the better therapeutic relationship, given more time available, with the CAM practitioner. The study did note that they just assessed health expenditures, not health outcomes so we cannot draw direct conclusions about the efficacy of the CAM therapies.
I should make a note here and discuss the one study that did find better outcomes with CAM. It used a costs-savings model in an in-patient oncology setting and was very well designed. Cost Savings in Inpatient Oncology Through an Integrative Medicine Approach is a study, given its clear outcomes, that I can get behind. The integrative approach here was not using herbal medicine or dis-proven acupuncture, it ”incorporated yoga therapy, holistic nursing techniques, and a “healing environment” into routine inpatient oncology care.” Not energy healing or reiki, but techniques that, while hard to quantify, were non-the-less successful at decreasing length of stay and saving money while providing excellent care. If this is where integrative medicine is going then I think it is a model that shows promise (this cost effectiveness study shows that it can save money, though I would take issue with the more dubious assertions of integrative medicine that focus on stress and life-style as the cause of all disease and the fallacy that drugs only cure symptoms). We just need to police the wackier CAM solutions, like “energy healing”, and ensure that evidence based medicine is married to patient-centerd care, and we can see gains to individual health (I still won't get my pony, though).
Finally, a Canadian study out of the Fraser Institute called Unnatural Regulation is worth a look, to give us a hint of where the major arguements from the CAM community are going to come. This study compiles a lot of the most recent data about the use of CAM in Canada and the attitudes of Canadians towards it. Unfortunately, there is a distinct willful ignorance in the work that ignores whether or not these therapies work and instead favours the argument that if it is popular then we should fund it. The paper is far too long to deconstruct at the end of this already long post, but I will present by itself in the near future as part of a plan to deconstruct the rift that exists between CAM and conventional medical theory. (EDIT: Scott Gavura already covered one aspect of this document in his post here so I will not duplicate his work)
In spite of the cautious success of integrative medicine movement, which is, I believe, distinct from most of the traditional complementary and alternative medical establishment, I keep coming back to the same conclusion: if it has been shown not to work or at best be a placebo, limited public funds should not pay for CAM delivery. The “health liberty” movement that frames the debate in the terms of the freedom to make choices is a false argument. I could just as easily fight for the right for “transportation freedom” and to not wear a seatbelt while in a motor vehicle – or indeed ride around town in a clunker with poor brakes and no exhaust system: its my right! However, we limit choice in society when we see a danger to society at large or the vunerable within it. We need regulation to keep people from taking advantage of others and we should not waste public resources on medicine that does not work just because people want it.
I would love for the government to buy me a pony, but it aint't gonna happen.
[SPOILER ALERT: Read on only if you have already watched Saturday's episode of Orphan Black.]
Season 2 of Orphan Black claimed a major victim tonight when Dr. Aldous Leekie met his untimely demise by the unlikeliest hand of all. After losing a Dyad power struggle with proclone Rachel, Leekie fled the institute, only to be stopped by a distraught Donnie. Donnie was so upset about his wife's…ahem…”probing” that he quit emphatically. Only one problem: When he quit, he also accidentally discharged the handgun he was holding, which splattered the doctor's brains all over the car windows. In our weekly post-episode Q&A, co-creator John Fawcett explains the decision to kill Leekie (played by Matt Frewer), as well as Rachel showing some actual emotion, going for big laughs in rehab, and the twisty-turny relationship that is Cosima and Delphine (or Cophine, for short).
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Let's start with some words for the dearly departed Aldous Leekie.
JOHN FAWCETT: We knew Dr. Leekie was going to die in season 2. And we knew that was something that we wanted to work towards and was going to be a big part of the Rachel/Dr. Leekie story and be a big part of why we've been telling a lot of this backstory. Ultimately, I think we didn't really know how we were going to do it. We knew we were going to do it, we just didn't know how we were going to do it. And [co-creator] Graeme [Manson] early on had this idea that Donnie should kill Dr. Leekie. It's funny because my initial reaction was “that's ridiculous.” Then we sort of kind of went at it a bunch of different ways: Who would kill him? How would he die? And ultimately we came back to Donnie. We wanted to do it in a surprising sort of strangely comic fashion, and that was the result.
EW: And to have Donnie be an accidental triggerman is kind of perfect.
FAWCETT: Yeah, we wanted it to be surprising. And you know that Leekie's life is in danger at the end of the episode. Rachel in a way kind of lets him escape, but there is a very real threat to his life, and Donnie just happens to step in the wrong place at the wrong time. The gun goes off.
EW: Obviously when you kill off a main character, that's a big deal and you have to walk through the pros and cons of doing that. So why Leekie and why now?
FAWCETT: Well, I think that obviously Dr. Leekie and Matt Frewer are a big part of our show and it is a very big decision to decide to eliminate a character. We don't want to just make those decisions lightly, and it really has to have a bearing on not just story structure of the season, but really the big picture also. It has to work towards our end goals. So we designed the first part of the season all the way to episode 7 knowing this was going to come to a head and that Leekie was going to die. We used that as building blocks for that character, and by the time the end came for him, he wanted to build a character that we actually had grown to like and maybe couldn't entirely trust, but were having some sympathies for. And he wasn't just a kind of bad guy. He was kind of in a weird way helping. It's interesting then to kind of kill off someone that actually the audience and the fans are sort of starting to like and care about. I think it was an important element to building that character and using his death to actually mean something at the end of episode 7, and going forward in the next bunch of episodes. Because Dr. Leekie's death…the fact that he's gone or missing or presumed dead or whatever — that informs a bunch of stories in the coming episodes.
EW: Now you guys aren't going to pull a Helena on me and tell me in season 3 that you've been lying to me this whole time and he is actually still alive, are you?
FAWCETT: I don't know, dude. That was clearly a bullet in the dead. That was, like, brains on the window. That one's hard to fake.
EW: Let's talk about the Cosima and Delphine relationship. You have this very tender scene where they kiss before Cosima begins her treatment, but then later Cosima confronts her on using Kira's stem cells, yells at her, and kicks her out of the lab. Why can't these crazy kids just ever stay happy?
FAWCETT: And that's one of my favorite scenes of Tat's in the episode — that scene where she tells Delphine, “This is my biology, my body,” and kicks her out of the lab. It's one of my favorite dramatic scenes for Tatiana in the episode. And this is the nature of this relationship — it's wanting to trust but can't trust, and Delphine kind of getting used by Dyad and being torn between her love for Cosima and the people that are pulling her strings in other directions. Listen, this is very much a love story. Right at the center of it, it's a love story between Cosima and Delphine. The two of them are just caught in unfortunate circumstances. I don't think Delphine wants to hurt Cosima. I think Delphine wants to protect Cosima and help Cosima, but there's all these other factors. And it also makes for good drama.
EW: You have elements of almost a classic screwball comedy at the rehab center with Vic passing out, and Sarah pretending to be Alison, and then Alison and Felix carrying Vic around and hitting his head on the wall. And then you throw Donnie in the mix, who's always funny.
FAWCETT: It's kind of our Weekend at Bernie's episode. One of those things that is so fun about this show is that we can play big, heavy emotional drama scenes on one hand, and kind of slip into hijinky-comedic fun on the other. We knew we wanted to make a predominantly comedic episode, and then it's kind of like okay, where is the line? How far can you go until you've gone a little too far? And it's interesting, because there's a line from episode 6 that I've seen quoted endlessly on Twitter now: It's Duncan the scientist saying “Once you've gone a little bit, it's hard not to go all the way.” And that sums up me and Graeme and the way we feel about this show in the first place. And that's part of the fun of the shenanigans at the treatment center.
EW: It's been awhile since we've had a good clone-impersonating-another-clone scene.
FAWCETT: It is definitely a fun aspect to our show. We don't want to do it all the time or it starts to kind of get a little…”Oh, we're impersonating a clone again.” You want to have fun with it, but use it judiciously. And that's something we hadn't seen before and it was just a fun aspect of trying to deal with Alison's dilemma and having a roofied Vic on the ground at the treatment center. That piece where Vic actually goes down, which is a very, very funny moment — our stuntman actually broke his nose. And we talked about it in meeting with our director of the episode, Ken: Should we have a breakaway table? When he hits it, does it shatter? Does it break? And Ken was very on this thing of, “I want it to be solid. I want it to hit it really hard and hit it as a solid, not a breakaway table.” And man, it is so painful to watch but hilarious. But it is one of those shining moments — just glitter and Alison's craft stuff flying in the air like a pinbowy, crafty Alison spray.
EW: What about the scene where Rachel is reunited with her father? This is the first time we've seen any emotion escape that icy exterior.
FAWCETT: This is the beginning of something new for Rachel. This is the beginning of a little journey of seeing Rachel as a much more emotional character. This is a discovery for her. Her father, not biological father, but her father is not dead. And the discovery that Aldous Leekie killed her mother, and has kept this entire thing from her this entire time — it's such a massive moment for this person. And as much as you want to paint her as a villain, and see her as sort of icy cold empowered woman, she's still here, and this news has a massive impact on her.
EW: And people are going to want to know about Michelle Forbes. How much more will we see of her as Marian?
FAWCETT: Well, Marian is definitely someone that is important to the story and to upcoming episodes and beyond.

The countdown is coming to an end. The engines ignite; the rocket is engulfed by a cloud of fire and smoke, lift off, and in an instant it's gone… billowing towards the heavens. Launch activity is an essential component of the spaceflight industry. It is impossible to benefit from space science and technology without putting satellites in orbit. But what are those billowing clouds actually made of? And what effect does a rocket launch have on the surrounding environment?
Launching from Guiana Space Centre
Perhaps the launch site most prone to such questions is the Guiana Space Centre (CSG), a French and European spaceport located in Kourou, in close proximity to the rain forest of French Guiana, host to some of the most diverse flora and fauna on Earth. Operational since 1968, CSG operates three different launch vehicles – the European Ariane V and Vega, and the Russian Soyuz, launched under the terms of a Russo-European joint venture.
Ariane V is a heavy launcher capable of putting six ton satellites into geostationary orbit and 21 ton payloads in low Earth orbit. Vega is a small launcher used to launch 1.5 ton satellites into a 700km low Earth orbit. Both use a solid propellant that releases aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) into the air, a molecule that can, in high concentrations, damage plant life.
The kerosene-powered Soyuz is able to put satellites between 2.7 and 4.9 tons in low Earth and geostationary orbits. This kind of propulsion generates emissions mostly composed of water (H 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), as well as other combustion residues. These residues contribute to acidification of plants and soils. However, there are only three Soyuz launches per year at CSG and these residues are also generated by other sources such as cars, planes, and boats. As a result, it is very difficult to monitor pollution specifically due to Soyuz launches.

Environmental Impact of Launchers
French space agency CNES created an environmental measurement plan after the infamous first Ariane V launch of 1996. The launch ended in disaster when the launcher exploded 36.7 seconds after lift-off. Nobody was injured, but the explosion highlighted the possible impact of launches on the local environment.
Since then, CNES has been monitoring environmental aspects after each launch, and some particular aspects periodically throughout the year. The environmental measurement plan at CSG measures the quality and the evolution of:
Air
Water in rivers and subsoil
Soil and subsoil
Vibration and acoustic
Plants
Wildlife, mainly fish and birds
CNES is not the only space agency to worry about its rockets polluting the environment. NASA, for instance, assesses the environmental impact of each program before it is authorized and has tested rocket wakes to determine their effect on the atmosphere. However, notes Sandrine Richard, an environmentalist working at CSG since 2005, it is difficult to reach a general understanding of launch impacts that translates across sites. “We could compare quantities of exhaust products using the number of launches, for example,” she says. “But the launchers are not comparable.” When comparing sites like Kourou and NASA's Cape Canaveral, the host environments are also dramatically different – but not as different as a site like Baikonour. It turns out environmental impact must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
The Kourou Environment
Within 35 years (1979-2014), CSG has seen more than 230 flights. Currently, it represents 7 to 10 flights per year that are impacting the local area each time. However, Richard and the team at CNES have observed that environmental changes are very small and located within about a one-kilometer radius around CSG. “The biodiversity is exactly the same around the CSG and on the Guianese littoral coast,” Richard states. “Plus, due to a controlled and limited human activity population of plants and animals are denser than near big cities.”
The bird Scarlet Ibis is one species that is regularly monitored at the site. This species lives on the littoral coast – the area from shoreline to high-water mark – occupied by CSG. The Ibis's eggshell thickness is very sensitive to the bird's food supply. If the Ibis ingests pollutants, it will produce more fragile eggs, jeopardizing the new generation of birds. Without interfering with the animals, scientists can measure the long term effects of launches on the birds.
So far, no dramatic impacts have been identified from CSG's existing launch schedule. But what happens as the number of launches increases? “For the case of Ariane 5, which produces alumina, it would need 1000 launches in order to double the quantity of alumina naturally present in Guianese soils,” says Richard. And that is a conservative estimate, assuming the rocket's entire fuel tank combusted on the launch pad. In reality, “only a few seconds of combustion impacts the launch area.”
Below, exploring the environment around CSG
The Human Effect
All of which is not to say there nothing to worry about when it comes to protecting the environment around spaceports. It turns out that the ongoing human presence required to support periodic launches is more damaging than the launches themselves. At CSG, “70% of power supply at CSG is used for air conditioning,” says Richard. As a result, part of her efforts are focused on sustainable development and renovating buildings to implement energy saving measures such as enhanced use of solar light and creating airtight windows.
Wherever impacts from launch activities can be reduced, they are. For instance, CSG is working on an improved gas production treatment technique at the payload S5 assembly. “The use of a washing column will considerably improve the treatment,” Richard notes, reducing the release of impurities. Such progress is immediately shared with others in the scientific community to spread successful methods across the globe.
Rockets and Wildlife: Living in Harmony
Rocket technologies are much more similar than the environments from which they launch. Rockets do not change when we move them from site to site. As Richard puts it, “we launch Soyuz in Baikonur as we launch it in Guiana.” But the infrastructure around those launches can differ dramatically to adapt to temperature, humidity, overall climate, and local flora and fauna. “There are impacts on buildings for preparing, storing and assembling for some operations which must be realized in a controlled environment,” explains Richard. This is where environment and spacecraft most come into conflict.
In addition to minimizing impact on the environment, CSG is finding ways to promote biodiversity in the region. Partnering with the National Forest Office (ONF), CSG organizes tourist visits of the surrounding area. Once a month, conducted by a guide from ONF, the public is able to learn about rare plants and animals living on the CSG grounds. It is a strange juxtaposition, some of Earth's most pristine ecosystems side-by-size with humanity's greatest technological construct. If Sandrine Richard's mission is successful, it is a juxtaposition that will thrive for many years to come.

Just days after the Associated Press provided an in-depth look at the massive economic impact of North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2 — the so-called “bathroom bill” Republicans passed a year ago — lawmakers in the state struck a deal to repeal and replace the bill.
The original legislation, commonly known as HB2, limited LGBTQ rights in the state and restricted which public restrooms transgender people can use. Following the bill's passage in March of last year, the Tar Heel state faced a major political and financial backlash. On Monday, an AP analysis found the bill would end up costing North Carolinians $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years.
So, now that HB2 has been repealed and replaced, will it be business as usual in North Carolina? Not quite.
'Fake Repeal'
LGBTQ advocates have slammed the agreement as a “fake repeal." Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, took to Twitter to say “any ally of the LGBTQ community cannot support this new version of #HB2.”
“This ‘deal' does NOT repeal #HB2. It's simply another version of HB2 dressed up in a way desperate lawmakers hope will save state's economy,” Griffin added, referencing the bill's replacement, which leaves state legislators in charge of policy over multi-stall bathrooms and puts a halt on local governments passing nondiscrimination ordinances.
Economic Impact
If it turns out North Carolina can't “save” its economy, and — as the AP estimates — it loses billions of dollars over a dozen years, how big of a loss is that for the state, and who stands to gain?
“It sounds big, $3.76 billion,” John Connaughton, an economics professor at University of North Carolina Charlotte, said, “but stretched over 12 years, it's a very small number.”
Both Connaughton and Michael Walden, an economics professor at North Carolina State University, told NBC Out to keep that number in perspective.
“The estimated $3.7 billion loss over 12 years is in context to an estimated aggregate state GDP (gross domestic product) over that time period of $6.8 trillion,” Professor Walden explained. “In percentage terms, that's a 0.06 percent loss.”
“That's about half a billion a year or less,” Connaughton said, adding that when compared to the state's GDP, “it's nothing.”

But, the Associated Press admits its numbers might be off, and unfortunately for the people of North Carolina, it would likely not be in their favor.
Researchers said they only accounted for projects that were abandoned or moved because of HB2, and AP concedes there's really no way to know the full impact of future projects that could have been awarded to North Carolina had there never been such a controversial law put in place.
“This is where most of the activity is,” Connaughton speculated. “The companies that never consider us from last year on because of HB2.”
Winners and Losers
What we can calculate, however, is a money trail pieced together from what we do know. So, who are the winners?
New Orleans, for one, after landing last month's NBA All-Star Game. City event planners, restaurateurs and hoteliers made out like bandits by combining already-set Fat Tuesday festivities with the high-profile basketball game. Charlotte watched an estimated $100 million in revenue vanish to the Big Easy when the league pulled its basketball tournament from the city.

Los Angeles will reap as much or more next year when the NBA holds its 2018 All-Star Game at the Staples Center downtown.
But far more important to the people of North Carolina is college hoops, on the same level as religion for many. And it looks as though the winners of the next five college basketball championships will not just be the teams that sink the most baskets, but the cities soon to be chosen by the NCAA. Next month, the group will announce the sites for title games through 2022, and the NCAA reportedly went so far as to issue an ultimatum to the state to repeal the controversial bill. It remains to be seen what the NCAA's reaction is to HB2's replacement.
This year's March Madness left Greensboro, N.C. a ghost town while the games that were scheduled to be played there were moved to Greenville, S.C. And that town wasn't the only winner as seventh-seeded South Carolina shocked second-seeded Duke with a victory before its hometown crowd last Sunday.
And as the Raleigh-based News Observer noted, no state is benefiting from North Carolina's loss in terms of sporting events more than its neighbor to the south.
“Even if they rescind HB2,” Connaughton noted prior to Thursday's repeal, “it takes a while before that ‘scarlet letter' disappears. And if you want to know about that, just ask South Carolina.”
South Carolina only recently emerged from NCAA limbo after finally taking down the Confederate flag from its Capitol, a controversy that barred its participation in hosting the college tournaments for 14 years.
Conway, S.C. scored the ACC women's basketball tourney this month, which was relocated from Greensboro, N.C., and football fans in central Florida are also winners, thanks to the ACC's decision to move its college football championship game to Orlando.
Of course, sports isn't the only form of entertainment that's been impacted. Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, Pearl Jam, Boston, Cirque du Soleil and other performers canceled shows in North Carolina because of HB2.

“When Ringo Starr doesn't come here because of HB2,” Connaughton said, “the $100 you paid for the ticket, $80 of it gets back on the bus and goes home with Ringo. Only the rental fee for the venue and concessions” actually make a dent in the local economy.
“From an economic impact standpoint, they're simply not that big,” Connaughton added, noting concerts are different compared to a big event like the NBA All-Star Game or even a Charlotte Hornets game. “The tickets may be the same price,” he said, but all the money changing hands stays in the community.
In addition to the sports and entertainment industries, there are also winners and losers in the broader business world.

“The largest loss was Paypal, which decided not to come to Charlotte,” Professor Walden said. The tech giant scrapped plans to erect a $3.6 million global operations center in Charlotte because of HB2.
“At the time,” Walden added, “reports indicated Florida and Arizona were runners-up.” However, a PayPal spokesperson told NBC Out “no public decisions have been made related to the operations center.”
A slew of other companies — including Deutsche Bank, Lionsgate Entertainment, Coca-Cola and Bank of America — canceled expansion plans or joined boycotts and signed letters of protest. But other than public perception of being on the side of equality, there was no real “win” for these corporations, Connaughton said. He did, however, note that the public perception is potentially a bigger and more long-term concern for these companies than economics.
In addition to South Carolina, only Virginia has noticed a sizable transfer of business from North Carolina.
For example, at last week's groundbreaking for a new Aldi distribution center in Dinwiddie, Va., Governor Terry McAuliffe referenced North Carolina, which also competed for the project.
“Let's be honest, North Carolina has been badly hit by HB2,” the Democratic governor crowed, having vetoed his own state's version of a similar “bathroom bill.”
The Aldi supermarket chain's new complex, worth an estimated $57 million, will employ 145 people, according to reports.
A bigger prize was last year's decision by CoStar, a real estate analytics company, to build a new research center not in Charlotte but in Richmond, Va. The deal will reportedly generate 732 jobs and an $8 million investment that is estimated to be worth a quarter of a billion dollars in local impact. Reports said Charlotte was the favorite until HB2 was passed.
While there are a number of HB2 winners and losers to point to, there could be many more uncounted ones. Charlotte real estate developer Johnny Harris was quoted in ThinkProgress with this speculation: “For every one company that decides to relocate to North Carolina … another 10 probably are not, deterred by HB2.”

Remember last month when TruthRevolt reported that the Chicago Dyke March kicked out a group of gay Jews, because it "triggered" the pro-Palestine supporters among them? Well, the reporter who broke that story, Gretchen Rachel Hammond, has been officially relieved of her journalistic duties. Though last week, she was on the Windy City Times's masthead as "senior writer," she is now listed as “senior account executive.”
The Algemeiner reports:
Hammond — whose June 24 story caused a national storm after she detailed how three women flying Jewish Pride flags embossed with the Star of David were instructed to leave the gathering by organizers from the Dyke March Collective — confirmed to The Algemeiner on Monday that while she was still employed by the paper, she was not presently engaged in its reporting and writing operations. “At this time, I have not been fired from Windy City Times, but I have been transferred to working full time for the sales department,” Hammond explained in an emailed statement. “The reasoning is an internal matter and I have been instructed not to comment about it even to close friends. Given my present situation, I must comply with this instruction.”
But here's the best part of The Algemeiner story, proving that you really can't be liberal enough for liberals. Once you accidentally tell the truth, you're out:
Hammond joined the Windy City Times as a reporter in 2013 and won the 2016 National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association Award for Excellence in News Writing. This year, Hammond was a finalist for the second time for the Lisagor Award, which honors journalists in Chicago. Hammond came to national attention in 2016 when she saved the life of one of her readers by donating a kidney. “This current and particularly ugly electoral cycle has been fueled by the politics of conceit,” Hammond later reflected in a column for the paper. “So it is easy to forget that, even if you don't have the resources of a wealthy philanthropist, it is more important than ever to help someone in need and, in so doing, change their world and, as a consequence of that action, the world as a whole for the better.”
So you have an award-winning journalist -- who's even been awarded for her LGBTQ work -- who is no longer good enough to even continue reporting. And this isn't because she made an error, but because she told the truth.

FRANKFURT/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Italy's Hacking Team, which makes surveillance software used by governments to tap into phones and computers, found itself the victim of hacking on a grand scale on Monday.
The controversial Milan-based company, which describes itself as a maker of lawful interception software used by police and intelligence services worldwide, has been accused by anti-surveillance campaigners of selling snooping tools to governments with poor human rights records.
Hacking Team's Twitter account was hijacked on Monday and used by hackers to release what is alleged to be more than 400 gigabytes of the company's internal documents, email correspondence, employee passwords and the underlying source code of its products.
“Since we have nothing to hide, we're publishing all our emails, files and source code,” posts published on the company's hijacked Twitter account said. The tweets were subsequently deleted.
Company spokesman Eric Rabe confirmed the breach, adding that “law enforcement will investigate the illegal taking of proprietary company property.”
Rabe acknowledged that the company was recommending that clients suspend use of the snooping programs until Hacking Team determines whether specific law enforcement operations have been exposed.
“We would expect this to be a relatively short suspension of service,” Rabe told Reuters.
Hacking Team customers include the U.S. FBI, according to internal documents published Monday. That agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
One U.S. privacy rights activist hailed the publication of the stolen Hacking Team documents as the “best transparency report ever”, while another digital activist compared the disclosures to a Christmas gift in July for anti-surveillance campaigners.
Among the documents published was a spreadsheet that purports to show the company's active and inactive clients at the end of 2014.
Those listed included police agencies in several European countries, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and police and state security organizations in countries with records of human rights abuses such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.
Sudan's National Intelligence Security Service was one of two customers in the client list given the special designation of “not officially supported”.
However, a second document, an invoice for 480,000 euros to the same security service, calls into question repeated denials by the Hacking Team that it has ever done business with Sudan, which is subject to heavy trade restrictions.
Hacking Team did not dispute the veracity of any of the documents, though it said some reports that claimed to be based on them contained misstatements.
It said it would not identify any customers because of still-binding confidentiality agreements.
The 12-year-old Hacking Team was named one of five private-sector “Corporate Enemies of the Internet” in a 2012 report by Reporters Without Borders.
Citizen Lab, a digital rights research group affiliated with the University of Toronto, has published numerous reports linking Hacking Team software to repression of minority and dissident groups, as well as journalists in a number of countries in Africa and the Middle East.

We are officially now entering the golden age of self-love with the makers of the male version of The Rabbit, The Fleshlight, today unveiling The Fleshlight LaunchPAD, an iPad-stand-cum-cum-receptacle which essentially allows its users to watch porn and love technology as much as Kip Dynamite does.
As the Fleshlight makers explain: “Interactive Life Forms, makers of Fleshlight brand products, the world's leading male sex toy, is pleased to announce the release of its newest innovative accessory, the Fleshlight LaunchPAD. The Fleshlight LaunchPAD securely holds the popular Apple iPad as well as a Fleshlight or Flight product enabling the user to enjoy the full Fleshlight experience while enjoying content or communicating live with a friend via applications like Facetime or Skype. The unique placement of the Fleshlight product in relationship to the iPad allows the user to fully immerse himself in POV – “Point of View” – pornographic content.”
The future is now and it's :/
One thing I've come to realize from being in IT so long is that you should be constantly learning new things. If you aren't, it's not because you're smart or because you know everything; it's because you're stagnating.
So, I was not surprised when I heard it was possible to apply NFSv4.x ACLs to files and folders and then mount them via NFSv3 and have the ACLs still work! I already knew that you could do audit ACEs from NFSv4.x for NFSv3 (covered in TR-4067), but had no idea this could extend into the permissions realm. If so, this solves a pretty big problem with NFSv3 in general, where your normal permissions are limited only to owner, group and then everyone else. That makes it hard to do any sort of granular access control for NFSv3 mounts, presents problems for some environments.
It also allows you to keep using NFSv3 for your workloads, whether for legacy application or general performance concerns. NFSv4.x has a lot of advantages over NFSv3, but if you don't need stateful operations or the NFSv4.x features, or integrated locking, then you are safe to stay with NFSv3.
So, is it possible to use NFSv4.x ACLs with NFSv3 objects?
You betcha!
The method for doing this is pretty straightforward.
Configure and enable NFSv4.x in ONTAP and on your client Enable NFSv4.x ACL support in ONTAP Mount the export via NFSv4.x Apply the NFSv4.x ACLs Unmount and then remount the export using NFSv3 and test it out!
Configuring NFSv4.x
When you're setting up NFSv4.x in an environment, there are a few things to keep in mind:
Client and NFS server support for NFSv4.x
NFS utilities installed on clients (for NFSv4.x functionality)
NFSv4.x configured on the client in idmapd.conf
NFSv4.x configured on the server in ONTAP (ACLS allowed)
Export policies and rules configured in ONTAP
Ideally, a name service server (like LDAP) to negotiate the server/client conversation of user identities
One of the reasons NFS4.x is more secure than NFSv3 is the use of user ID strings (such as user@domain.com) to help limit cases of user spoofing in NFS conversations. This ID string is required to be case-sensitive. If the string doesn't match on both client and server, then the NFSv4.x mounts will get squashed to the defined “nobody” user in the NFSv4.x client. One of the more common issues seen with NFSv4.x mounts is the “nobody:nobody” user and group on files and folders. One of the most common causes of this is when a domain string is mismatched on the client and server.
In a client that domain string is defined in the idmapd.conf file. Sometimes, it will default to the DNS domain. In ONTAP, the v4-id-domain string should be configured to the same value on the client to provide proper NFSv4.x authentication.
Other measures, such as Kerberos encryption, can help lock the NFS conversations down further. NFSv4.x ACLs are a way to ensure that files and folders are only seen by those entities that have been granted access and is considered to be authorization, or, what you are allowed to do once you authenticate. For more complete steps on setting up NFSv4.x, see TR-4067 and TR-4073.
However, we're only setting up NFSv4.x to allow us to configure the ACLs…
What are NFSv4.x ACLs?
NFSv4.x ACLs are a way to apply granular permissions to files and folders in NFS outside of the normal “read/write/execute” of NFSv3, and across more objects than simple “owner/group/everyone.” NFSv4.x ACLs allow administrators to set permissions for multiple users and groups on the same file or folder and treat NFS ACLs more like Windows ACLs. For more information on NFSv4.x ACLs, see:
http://wiki.linux-nfs.org/wiki/index.php/ACLs
https://linux.die.net/man/5/nfs4_acl
http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4067.pdf
NFSv3 doesn't have this capability by default. The only way to get more granular ACLs in NFSv3 natively is to use POSIX ACLs, which ONTAP doesn't support.
Once you've enabled ACLs in ONTAP (v4.0-acl and/or v4.1-acl options), you can mount an NFS export via NFSv4.x and start applying NFSv4.x ACLs.
In my environment, I mounted a homedir volume and then set up an ACL on a file owned by root for a user called “prof1” using nfs4_setfacl -e (which allows you to edit a file rather than have to type in a long command).
[root@centos7 /]# mount demo:/home /mnt [root@centos7 /]# mount | grep mnt demo:/home on /mnt type nfs4 (rw,relatime,vers=4.0,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,port=0,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,clientaddr=10.193.67.225,local_lock=none,addr=10.193.67.237)
The file lives in the root user's homedir. The root homedir is set to 755, which means anyone can read them, but no one but the owner (root) can write to them.
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 13 10:42 root
That is, unless, I set NFSv4.x ACLs to allow a user full control:
[root@centos7 mnt]# nfs4_getfacl /mnt/root/file A::prof1@ntap.local:rwaxtTnNcCy A::OWNER@:rwaxtTnNcCy A:g:GROUP@:rxtncy A::EVERYONE@:rxtncy
I can also see those permissions from the ONTAP CLI:
ontap9-tme-8040::*> vserver security file-directory show -vserver DEMO -path /home/root/file Vserver: DEMO File Path: /home/root/file File Inode Number: 8644 Security Style: unix Effective Style: unix DOS Attributes: 20 DOS Attributes in Text: ---A---- Expanded Dos Attributes: - UNIX User Id: 0 UNIX Group Id: 1 UNIX Mode Bits: 755 UNIX Mode Bits in Text: rwxr-xr-x ACLs: NFSV4 Security Descriptor Control:0x8014 DACL - ACEs ALLOW-user-prof1-0x1601bf ALLOW-OWNER@-0x1601bf ALLOW-GROUP@-0x1200a9-IG ALLOW-EVERYONE@-0x1200a9
I can also expand the mask to translate the hex:
In the above, I gave prof1 full control over the file. Then, I mounted via NFSv3:
[root@centos7 /]# mount -o nfsvers=3 demo:/home /mnt [root@centos7 /]# mount | grep mnt demo:/home on /mnt type nfs (rw,relatime,vers=3,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,namlen=255,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,mountaddr=10.193.67.219,mountvers=3,mountport=635,mountproto=udp,local_lock=none,addr=10.193.67.219)
When I become a user that isn't on the NFSv4.x ACL, I can't write to the file:
[root@centos7 /]# su student1 sh-4.2$ cd /mnt/root sh-4.2$ ls -la total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 13 10:42 . drwxrwxrwx 11 root root 4096 Jul 10 10:04 .. -rwxr-xr-x 1 root bin 0 Jul 13 10:23 file -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar 29 11:37 test.txt sh-4.2$ touch file touch: cannot touch ‘file': Permission denied sh-4.2$ rm file rm: remove write-protected regular empty file ‘file'? y rm: cannot remove ‘file': Permission denied
When I change to the prof1 user, I have access to do whatever I want, even though the mode bit permissions in v3 say I can't:
[root@centos7 /]# su prof1 sh-4.2$ cd /mnt/root sh-4.2$ ls -la total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 13 10:42 . drwxrwxrwx 11 root root 4096 Jul 10 10:04 .. -rwxr-xr-x 1 root bin 0 Jul 13 10:23 file -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar 29 11:37 test.txt sh-4.2$ vi file sh-4.2$ cat file NFSv4ACLS!
When I do a chmod, however, nothing seems to change from the NFSv4 ACL for the user. I set 700 on the file, which shows up in NFSv3 mode bits:
sh-4.2$ chmod 700 file sh-4.2$ ls -la total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 13 10:42 . drwxrwxrwx 11 root root 4096 Jul 10 10:04 .. -rwx------ 1 root bin 11 Aug 11 09:58 file -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar 29 11:37 test.txt
But notice how the prof1 user still has full control:
ontap9-tme-8040::*> vserver security file-directory show -vserver DEMO -path /home/root/file Vserver: DEMO File Path: /home/root/file File Inode Number: 8644 Security Style: unix Effective Style: unix DOS Attributes: 20 DOS Attributes in Text: ---A---- Expanded Dos Attributes: - UNIX User Id: 0 UNIX Group Id: 1 UNIX Mode Bits: 700 UNIX Mode Bits in Text: rwx------ ACLs: NFSV4 Security Descriptor Control:0x8014 DACL - ACEs ALLOW-user-prof1-0x1601bf ALLOW-OWNER@-0x1601bf ALLOW-GROUP@-0x120088-IG ALLOW-EVERYONE@-0x120088
This is because of an ONTAP option known as “ACL Preservation.”
ontap9-tme-8040::*> nfs show -vserver DEMO -fields v4-acl-preserve vserver v4-acl-preserve ------- --------------- DEMO enabled
When I set the option to enabled, the NFSv4.x ACLs will survive mode bit changes. If I disable the option, the ACLs get blown away when a chmod is done:
ontap9-tme-8040::*> nfs modify -vserver DEMO -v4-acl-preserve disabled ontap9-tme-8040::*> nfs show -vserver DEMO -fields v4-acl-preserve vserver v4-acl-preserve ------- --------------- DEMO disabled [root@centos7 root]# chmod 755 files
And the ACLs are wiped out:
ontap9-tme-8040::*> vserver security file-directory show -vserver DEMO -path /home/root/file Vserver: DEMO File Path: /home/root/file File Inode Number: 8644 Security Style: unix Effective Style: unix DOS Attributes: 20 DOS Attributes in Text: ---A---- Expanded Dos Attributes: - UNIX User Id: 0 UNIX Group Id: 1 UNIX Mode Bits: 755 UNIX Mode Bits in Text: rwxr-xr-x ACLs: -
I'd personally recommend setting that option to “enabled” if you want to do v3 mounts with v4.x ACLs.
So, there you have it… a new way to secure your NFSv3 mounts!

Robert Mercer – the “Renaissance Technologies” co-chief executive who bankrolled Donald Trump's presidential campaign – once said black Americans are “the only racist people remaining in the U.S.,” according to a lawsuit brought by former employee David Magerman.
Mercer who, alongside daughter Rebekah Mercer, fought to install chief White House strategist Steve Bannon and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway in the Trump administration, allegedly made “a series of racist comments” in conversation with Magerman.
According to a complaint filed by the former “Renaissance” employee, Mercer allegedly told Magerman the US “began to go in the wrong direction after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in the 1960.” Mercer also told Magerman that black people “were doing just fine” before its passage and insisted they are the “only racist people remaining in the U.S.”
“Magerman was stunned by these comments and pushed back” against Mercer, the complaint reads.
Magerman is suing Mercer for wrongful termination after he was fired for criticizing Mercer's support of the president.

An asteroid-bound spacecraft operated by the University of Arizona will get a nudge from Earth Friday to align it with its target.
For the past year, the University of Arizona-led OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has been following Earth's orbit around the sun.
Mission engineers are using Earth's gravity to move the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft instead of burning precious fuel. The gravity boost will propel the spacecraft to its rendezvous next year with the space rock, named Bennu.
“We're going to be utilizing the momentum from the Earth to essentially slingshot us to our trajectory towards Bennu, the asteroid that we'll be approaching in 2018,” said science operations engineer Sara Knutson.
The spacecraft will be about 11,000 miles away from Earth's surface for the gravity assist and will be traveling at about 19,000 miles when it approaches Earth.
“We'll be coming down over Australia and then cutting underneath and will fly right over Antarctica, and then it will slingshot us out and we will move away from the Earth at that time,” Knutson said.
Instruments on board the spacecraft will power up a few hours later so scientists can get a feel for operating them in space. The cameras will take images of Earth and the moon, and spectrometers will gather thermal and infrared spectral data.
The OSIRIS-REx mission's goal is to orbit the asteroid for several years, find a place to grab a sample and then return the dust to Earth in 2023.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Contractors hired by the U.S. Defense and State departments to help support operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have wasted or stolen billions of tax payer dollars since 2002, according to a Congressional report released this week. Of the $206 billion the Pentagon has spent, at least $31 billion, and possibly as much as $60 billion, have been lost, according to the House Commission on Wartime Contracting. Meanwhile, the DoD auditing agency tasked with auditing all contractors is falling behind with a backlog of $600 billion in unaudited work, which could exceed $1 trillion by 2016. The report comes as the State Department plans to increase its manpower in Iraq by 8,000 to 17,000, , as the U.S. military gradually pulls out, primarily by hiring contractors.

Image caption Fighting between the Turkish army and the PKK has intensified in recent months
Ten members of Turkey's security forces have been killed in an attack by Kurdish rebels close to the border with Iraq and Syria, officials say.
Around 20 militants also died in the south-eastern province of Sirnak, governor Vahdettin Ozkan said.
The fighting broke out late on Sunday evening and was continuing, he said.
Clashes between the army and the rebel PKK - which seeks autonomy for the Kurds - have intensified in the region in the past year.
The PKK attacked police and military targets in the town of Beytussebap late on Sunday night with guns and rocket-launchers, Turkish media reported.
Nine members of the security forces were killed and a tenth died later in hospital, local officials said. A further seven soldiers were wounded.
According to the governor, the rebels appeared to have carried out a series of simultaneous attacks on checkpoints, Anatolia news agency said.
The military had responded with an extensive military offensive, Mr Ozkan was reported as saying.
Both the US and EU classify the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) as a terrorist organisation. It began a guerrilla campaign for an ethnic homeland in the Kurdish heartland of south-eastern Turkey in 1984.
Some 40,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed in its war with the Turkish state.
Fighting has increased in recent months, blamed partly on the turmoil in neighbouring Syria.
Ankara accuses Syria of allowing the PKK to operate on its territory although government forces have ceded control of some Kurdish areas of northern Syria to the opposition.
A month ago, rebels fired rocket launchers on a Turkish army border post in the middle of a large-scale military offensive in Hakkari province.
More recently, the PKK was blamed for a bombing in the south-eastern city of Gaziantep which left nine people dead, including four children. The PKK denied any involvement.

As cannabis is taken more seriously as a medicine and a treatment, more people are taking a chance and using it as a treatment for terminal illnesses. This treatment has had overwhelmingly positive results for countless people who had no other hope of recovery. Every day more stories and scientific studies are appearing from all over the world where people of all ages, even young children, are cured of life-threatening illnesses with cannabis oil.
More often than not, these patients face legal penalties and even jail time for trying to better their lives. In the case of parents with children who have terminal illnesses, they are forced to break laws to get their kids the treatment that they need.
The father of a 2-year-old with late-stage cancer is facing jail time for using cannabis oil in an attempt to ease his daughter's suffering.
Adam Koessler of Queensland, Austrailia is one of these parents who are facing potential prison time for attempting to save their children's lives with cannabis oil. Koessler's 2-year-old daughter was diagnosed with stage-4 neuroblastoma, and when chemo was not working, he began giving her doses of cannabis oil after reading about how well it did for other people. Instantly he noticed remarkable results and an extreme improvement in her condition.
“The results were amazing, what we saw when Rumer was given the medical cannabis oil what nothing short of miraculous. Her cancer ridden little body was alive again — Rumer had almost instant quality of life…Her skin color came back, her eyes were sparkling again…We were certain after seeing these results that her recovery was entirely possible,” Koessler said.
Sadly, the hospital contacted the police and told them about what was happening, and they quickly arrested Koessler at the hospital for
possessing ‘dangerous drugs' and for supplying them to a minor. After he was released on bail the terms of his release prevented him from seeing his daughter and they have removed him from any involvement in his daughter's treatment.
He has attempted to send his daughter organic meals so she is more healthy to fight the cancer, but the meals have been rejected from the hospital and they prevent her from receiving them.
A petition demanding that the government drop the charges against Koessler and allow him to see his daughter has received over 201,928 supporters, and his case has caught the attention of people all over the world.
Koessler attempted to see his daughter again last week and was denied by the staff at the hospital.
Although the government and law enforcement are at the root of this problem by continuing to wage the war on drugs, the hospital and their staff have played a major role in this incident. In their arrogance, they rejected the possibility of a natural cure and have used the enforcement arm of the government to prevent these potential cures from being explored.
Those who would keep a potentially life-saving medicine from a suffering 2-year-old child are nothing short of vile criminals. Nothing illustrates the insanity, immorality, and sheer evil of the drug war quite like punishing a parent for trying to save their child's life and forcing a toddler to suffer.

Learn Sex Tips for Pursuing a Threesome and how to do it the right way and go about it! Experimenting with sexual activities adds spice to a couple's love life, which is why some people find themselves interested in a threesome: sex between three people. Certainly, maintaining a healthy penis is a consideration before embarking on such an affair, as well as ensuring other penis care factors. But what other sex tips should a couple be aware of before diving into a threesome?
Be on the same page.
Probably the most important factor is being sure that both participants are on the same page, meaning they are in agreement about what is involved.
As an example, and one that is the most basic: What is the composition of this threesome? A man might take it for granted, for example, that a threesome means that he would be bedding two beautiful women. A woman might at the same time just assume that another man would be added into their existing mix. It's best to be clear about this from the outset before going too far down the road.
Know how flexible to be.
Suppose the man has one idea of the composition, and the woman has another, as above. The couple then needs to think about their flexibility. Can one side bend and agree to the other's desire for the sex of the third party? Can they compromise and have one threesome with a male added and another with a female added?
Talk about why a threesome is desirable.
Discussing a threesome opens up some other conversations which can be valuable. Is the couple interested because their love life has become a little stale or predictable? Being honest about this can be productive, as it may lead to the couple exploring other options as well (such as role-playing, sex toys, etc.).
Think about what will occur.
Will all three participants do everything to each other? Or will there be roles? For example, if it's two females and one male, will the male penetrate both females? If two males and a female, will the men only engage with the female or with each other as well? Discussing what is in a couple's comfort zone can help avoid some awkward moments later.
Man issues
Men will need to take some extra time to make sure they are in the right frame of mind for a threesome. If a second man is going to be added into the mix, how is the first male going to feel about the “competition?” Is he going to be comparing his equipment to that of the other man? Is he prepared if the other man has a member that is larger or that has a more “perfect” appearance than his own?
If he will be servicing a second woman, is he secure in his ability and appearance? Does he worry that his current mate may value his penis but fear that a newcomer might find it lacking? Has his penis health routine ensured that he presents a member that is healthy and attractive to a new partner?

A veteran U.S. State Department foreign service officer says his job is on the line after he posted a link on his blog to a WikiLeaks document.
Peter Van Buren, who has worked for the department for 23 years and just published a book that is critical of U.S. reconstruction projects in Iraq, said this week that the State Department had launched an investigation against him earlier this month for disclosing classified information.
His crime, he said, was a link he posted on August 25 in a blog post discussing the hypocrisy of recent U.S. actions against Libyan leader Muammar Qadaffi. The link went to a 2009 cable about the sale of U.S. military spare parts to Qadaffi through a Portuguese middleman.
We recently recapped the weird history of US-Libyan relations, focusing on how, after years of hating on and bombing Qaddafi, soon after the Iraq war commenced we suddenly decided we liked him. The US opened diplomatic relations in 2009 and had all sorts of warm feelings for the once-pariah state. Then somehow in 2011 he started hating on and bombing Qaddafi again. New cables, on Wikileaks, now give us a hint at how cozy the US-Libyan relationship (briefly) was. To start, Libya needed lots of spare parts for its military after years of embargoes. The US was happy to assist. An unclassified cable from 2009 outlined that the US sold “Miscellaneous parts, components, accessories, and attachments for the L100 aircraft and T56 engines belonging to the Libyan Air Force,” conveniently through a Portuguese middleman. Wonder if any of those refitted aircraft played any part in the recent unpleasantness in Libya? The cable asked Embassy Lisbon and Embassy Tripoli to check up on these exports, as they had (duh) military usage and cordially concludes “Department is grateful for Post's assistance in this matter.”
Van Buren wrote in a post published on Tuesday, the same day his new book, We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People is being released, that he was interrogated by State Department officials twice this month.
Van Buren said he was under investigation for allegedly disclosing classified information – even though he had merely linked to documents that were already widely available on the internet. The cable was just one in a cache of more than 250,000 State Department cables that WikiLeaks allegedly obtained from former Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning last year and has been posting piecemeal online with media partners in the U.S. and Europe since last November.
"In other words, a link to a document posted by who-knows-who on a public website available at this moment to anyone in the world was the legal equivalent of me stealing a Top Secret report, hiding it under my coat, and passing it to a Chinese spy in a dark alley," Van Buren wrote this week.
The State Department investigators, he said, demanded to know who had helped him with his blog and told him that every blog post, Facebook post, and tweet by State Department employees had to be pre-cleared by the Department prior to publication. They also drilled him about the details of his publishing contract – including how much he had been paid – and told him that his refusal to answer questions would lead to his firing. And they warned him against writing about their interrogation, saying he could be charged with interfering with a government investigation if he did so.
Van Buren said the Principal Deputy Secretary of State subsequently wrote his publisher demanding small national security redactions from his book, which had already shipped to bookstores. Among the cuts requested was a vignette that he said was based on a scene from the movie Black Hawk Down.
Van Buren linked to the cable after WikiLeaks abruptly opened the spigot on its cache of cables in August, spewing out more than 130,000 over a few days after a news story in a German news weekly revealed that the entire database of cables had already been inadvertently leaked online by WikiLeaks supporters, along with the password to unlock the file.
"The State Department and its Bureau of Diplomatic Security never took responsibility for their part in the loss of all those cables, never acknowledged their own mistakes or porous security measures," Van Buren wrote this week. "No one will ever be fired at State because of WikiLeaks—except, at some point, possibly me."
Van Buren said his real crime appeared to be speaking critically about U.S. policies in the Middle East.
"The advantage of all this? It gets rid of a 'troublemaker,' and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security people can claim that they are 'doing something' about the WikiLeaks drip that continues even while they fiddle," he wrote. "Of course, it also chills free speech, sending a message to other employees about the price of speaking plainly."
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.

When German investigators raided the Munich home of a German foreign intelligence (BND) employee, they didn't find a secret radio transmitter or directions to a dead-letter drop in invisible ink.
Instead they found a computer with a manipulated weather app. Check the weather in New York, according to reports, and an encryption application popped open.
This is one of the routes the 31-year-old agent from the BND's foreign department is believed to have used to transmit classified documents to US intelligence, with unconfirmed reports putting their number at more than 200.
The BND official, said to be partially sighted and at the agency for nine years, reportedly began his career as a double agent two years ago when he sent a mail to the US embassy offering to sell them documents.
Since then, he is believed to have handed the documents via encrypted emails and on USB sticks during meetings in Vienna. Unconfirmed reports said the agent had access to information on all of the BND's foreign operations and agent identities – as well as documents on a Berlin parliamentary inquiry into National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance.
‘That's enough'
On Friday the US ambassador to Germany, John Emerson, was summoned in to the foreign ministry and told that Berlin expected answers.
With the US still declining to comment on the affair, German interior minister Thomas de Maizière said yesterday he expected the US government to provide “quick, clear answers”. “This affair has to be sorted out quickly,” he told German television.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, who learned of the claims last Thursday, is on a trade mission to China. Journalists travelling with her described her as being surprised and disappointed by the revelations.
The whole spying scandal only came to light by accident after the BND official sent a mail to the Russian embassy on May 28th, offering to sell BND documents to Russian intelligence. The mail was intercepted by Germany's domestic intelligence (BfV). They sent a fake reply, pretending to be a Russian agent, but got no response.
The BfV then contacted US intelligence, requesting information on the German mole's Gmail account. They got no response from their US counterparts and eventually tracked him down within the BND.
When they arrested him on Wednesday, it was under suspicion of selling secrets to Moscow. But in an interrogation session he insisted his partner was the CIA and he had earned a reported €25,000 in three separate file handovers.
Over the weekend, German domestic and foreign intelligence officers worked to establish a full picture of the double agent's access – and the scale of the damage.
“All the evidence suggests that he was working for the Americans,” said a senior security official to the Frankfurter Allgemeine's Sunday edition.
After a year of revelations of NSA spying from whistleblower Edward Snowden, including a US tap on Dr Merkel's mobile phone, this is just the latest bombshell to leave political Berlin shocked.
German officials said yesterday the affair threatened to derail bilateral relations already strained by previous surveillance efforts.

Discover the Place Where Problems Go to Die…
You have problems. A lot of them. And if you don't right now, you will soon.
That's life. One damn problem after another.
They're built into the mechanism.
Life's default setting is chaos, disorder, and problems.
And it's all by design.
But there's beauty in the problems. There are gifts in there if you just look.
Your problems help you learn.
They help you grow.
They can help you evolve through your fears.
They give you a chance turn to something greater. And to turn into something greater.
And they can help you to discover the one place where problems don't exist.
Right here. Right now.
The ONLY thing that is. The only thing that's real. Where freedom lives and problems go to die.
The greater your current pain, challenges, and so-called problems you face, the greater the opportunity to be free.
Your life will always be full of discord. Always full of issues. Always full of problems.
But none of it can truly exist when you come back to now.
They can only live then, there, and in your head.
Not here, now, and in your heart.
When you come back to just this—this single moment—you are free of everything you thought was a problem.
In the clear view of the moment, you can see that your problems are actually no more than thoughts themselves.
Perception, misinterpretation, and stories in your head you've created based on fear.
But when you step into the moment completely, you're able to step out of the storyline and into peace.
Just this. So simple and magical.
Just this.
Make friends with this, and all those giant problems will shrink into oblivion.
At least for a moment.
This moment.
The only moment there is.
And yeah, your story is still full of problems, but you aren't. And once you've figured out a way to arrange the story of your life so that you no longer have the problems you think you have now, some more problems will come in and replace 'em.
And if you're lucky, they'll be big enough, and hurt enough, to bring you back to this.
Just this.
Right here. Right now.
Where problems go to die, and life begins.
Talk soon,
Big Chris

Have you ever wished you could just buy a little piece of a lot of different stocks so that you could be diversified without having to pay a separate commission fee for every single stock? Well, you can! Its called an “Exchange Traded Fund” or ETF for short and it may be the perfect way to diversify your portfolio or gain exposure to a certain sector of the market. Today we are going to cover the basics of an ETF so you can decide if it fits well with your investing strategy.
What Exactly Is An ETF?
An ETF is an investment strategy where money is pooled together from several investors and invested by a fund manager into a variety of stocks, bonds, and other equities. This allows the investor to potentially be diversified in several different equities by buying a single share of an ETF. Depending on how the ETF is managed by the fund manager will determine the fees associated with investing in an ETF. ETFs are also traded throughout the course of the day so it acts similar to a normal stock. The types of securities that are held in an ETF all depends on the particular ETF you buy. The performance of the ETF you buy will depend on the performance of the underlying securities inside that ETF.
Picking the perfect ETF
Deciding what ETF to invest in depends on what type of securities you want exposure to and your individual risk tolerance. Let's break down the two most common ETFs on the market.
Index Fund
An Index fund seeks to match the performance of a larger index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones 30. An Index fund will be comprised of all or most of the securities found in one of these larger indexes so your gain or loss should closely match that of the particular index which your ETF follows. Typically an index fund will provide the investor with the greatest amount of diversification. Index funds typically have lower fees associated with them because they require very little management.
Sector ETF
A sector ETF is geared to match the performance of a particular sector of the market such as technology or financial securities. Let's say that you are bullish on the technology sector but you don't want to put all your eggs in a single basket. By purchasing an ETF that is focused on the technology sector you can gain exposure to multiple equities in this sector without the risk of losing large sums of money do to a single stock underperforming. Keep in mind that these types actively managed ETFs tend to have higher fees than index funds.
What To Pay Attention To
The Prospectus
The prospectus for an ETF is a document created by the manager of the fund that lays out all the details about that ETF. These documents can be long and sometimes be confusing to read but nonetheless are important. The prospectus will tell you about the person managing the fund, the fees associated, the goal of the fund, and of course all the different underlying securities that make up the fund.
Fees Associated with the fund
Whether the fund offers a fee of 0.5% or a fee of 1.5% may not seem like it makes a big difference but fees add up over time and can really begin to chip away at the potential gains. When comparing different ETFs make sure that you take the management fees into consideration.
Stay away from leveraged and inverse ETFs
Leveraged ETFs are intended to amplify the returns of the underlying securities the ETF is composed of. The fees associated with these ETFs tend to be high and your potential downside is much more than your potential upside. Do not buy.
Inverse ETFs are intended to perform the opposite of the underlying securities that make up the ETF. Once again, fees are high and these types of ETFs often do not match in terms of gain, the amount the underlying securities go down. These ETFs are very speculative and highly risky. Do not buy.
Remember today we just covered the basics, be sure to do more research before investing in an ETF. They may just be the perfect addition to your portfolio! Let me know what you think by leaving a comment below or click on the “contact” tab at the top of the page to email me any questions and as always thanks for reading and have a great day!
Netflix: Broadband Caps Not a 'Successful Business Model' Back in 2010 Netflix claimed they weren't worried about the impact of bandwidth caps on their business. That changed dramatically a year or two later, especially as the company expanded their streaming offerings into Canada, where low caps and high per byte overages are the norm. Post Canadian launch, and Netflix began talking about caps as an anti-competitive weapon and a form of price gouging completely untied to economic or network realities. This month, Netflix CFO David Wells argued that while the company allows users to scale the quality of their connections to manage bandwidth caps, they still quote: "I don't think that through an ISP, usage caps are necessarily a successful business model, outside of particularly low income and very value oriented consumers," he added, while highlighting that charging for premium broadband service could be a more effective strategy for ISPs. "I think the successful business model is much more, 'let me sell you a faster broadband and I'll charge you more for it,'" Wells said. Granted the entire purpose of bandwidth caps is to protect TV revenues from Netflix streaming while cashing in on an explosion of Netflix streaming at the same time. That's technically a "successful business model," it may just not be a consumer friendly one -- and it's one only made possible by limited competition.

@myvzw.com 2 recommendations Grecco Anon Seems a little self serving No offense, but monotizing things that have real costs is part of doing business. Netflix expecting free peering AND no usage charges is pretty self serving. Next they will expect to get network titles to serve for free
A business model built entirely on others infrastructure $$ and assets will never fly. This is why they resort to PR sound bites vs business logic. Good luck
Media playback is not supported on this device 'Lucky' Petrov reflects on long year
Aston Villa captain Stiliyan Petrov says he is lucky to be alive as he continues his fight against leukaemia.
The Bulgarian was diagnosed in March 2012 but is now in remission after finishing his first year of treatment.
Petrov on Villa's season "They've kept fighting and the last several weeks they've played with great confidence and have picked up a lot of important points. "They have a manager [Petrov's former Celtic team-mate Paul Lambert] who I know very closely. He's a good friend as well and I know how important it is for his team to improve and to win as well. These are positive things. "There are still a lot of games to come, a lot of points to be picked up, so there's nothing to worry about."
"I've had my hard moments but I've had good moments as well. I'm lucky because some people with this disease will die very quickly," said the 33-year-old.
"I'm glad that this hard year is behind me now and I can concentrate on getting back to my life."
Petrov, who joined Villa in 2006 having spent seven years with Celtic, was back at Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground this week.
Recalling his emotions when he first learned of his condition, he told Aston Villa's website: "At the start I thought it was just a cold, nothing serious.
"When I was told the diagnosis, I was a little shocked but accepted it and just wanted to start the treatment straight away."
Following an intensive chemotherapy programme Petrov, who has made over 200 appearances for Villa in addition to more than 300 for Celtic, is now in remission.
"I have finished all of the high intensity treatment and from now on I'll be on the softer treatment, which is two years on tablets," he said. "It was a very, very long year but now, after all this treatment, I can go back to a normal life.
"The support from all the fans, the club, the players, has been amazing."
What is leukaemia? Leukaemia affects certain blood cells, particularly the white cells, or leukocytes, which are part of the body's defence against infection and disease. Read more
That support extends to the Villa fans applauding Petrov in the 19th minute of every match, in recognition of the midfielder's squad number at the club.
"The 19th minute has been just incredible," he said. "It's them showing their appreciation and their support.
"I don't know how I can thank the fans because it's been incredible. Sometimes I joke with friends when they text me saying, 'You've still got that applause in the 19th minute, when are they going to stop?!'"
Asked about his plans for the future he added: "First of all I'm going to spend some time with the family, show them that things are back to normal and feel a bit more comfortable. The kids especially have really missed me a lot and they're happy that I'm home.
"I'm hoping to open my foundation soon and I'm going to start raising money and awareness for leukaemia and different charities."

Walking the halls of the Congress, you never know who you might run into – and today it was a blast from the past.
I sat down in the subway that runs beneath the Capitol, and across from me was none other than former Senator Larry Craig.
The Idaho Republican greeted me with a smile and told me that he was now back "making the rounds" to see his former Senate colleagues for his clients.
Craig is now a lobbyist – and Senate rules prohibit former senators from lobbying any lawmaker or aide for two years.
It's hard to believe – but it has now been more than two years since Craig retired from the Senate following his infamous 2007 alleged foot tapping scandal in a men's bathroom at the Minneapolis airport. He was arrested in a sex sting – accused of using a signal "used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct." Craig pleaded guilty, but later said he regretted doing that.
As we took the short subway ride from the Capitol to the Russell Senate office building, a cheerful Craig told me he still spends most of his time in his home state of Idaho with his children and grandchildren. He then said goodbye, and was off to his next appointment.

Our vision at Etsy is that business can be used for good, and that thinking about our impact on people and values can go hand in hand with thinking about profits. As we grow, our commitment to that vision remains at the core of our identity and is woven into the decisions we make in running our business, from the sourcing of our office supplies to the benefits we provide to our employees to what kind of content we allow to be sold through our website.
Today we seek to balance two principles that are critically important to us: freedom of speech and protection from discrimination. Freedom of speech and expression is important to us because we are a community of artists, artisans, and curators of all backgrounds, aesthetics, and viewpoints. If you search our site, you will see a wide variety of items testifying to our diversity and our seemingly limitless creativity.
This freedom, however, is not without limits. In the past, we have taken actions to protect our community and to preserve our integrity as both a creative and an ethical space. We want Etsy to be safe, welcoming, and respectful for everyone, including artists, women, and minorities. For this reason, it has long been against our policies to allow content on our site that demeans people based upon race, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity, disability, or sexual orientation.
You may have been following the struggle of one ethnic group that has made a lot of headlines lately: Native Americans and their fight against the Washington, D.C. professional football team name and mascot, which they have long considered offensive, disparaging, and racist. This very poignant ad was followed by a decision by the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the team's trademarks. Following this decision, an increasing number of public figures, politicians, schools, news publications, and private companies have spoken out in protest of the name and mascot.
Like the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, we at Etsy find the opinion of the minority group itself to carry most weight in determining whether the mascot is disparaging. In no uncertain terms, Native American groups have consistently advocated and litigated that the term “redskin(s)” is disparaging and damaging to Native Americans. Therefore, it will no longer be permitted in our marketplace.
THE new anti-austerity alliance dubbed the 'Scottish Syriza' has announced plans for its inaugural conference as it steps up preparations for the 2016 Holyrood election.
Based around the Scottish Socialist party and the grassroots Scottish Left Project, the group is expecting hundreds of activists to gather at the Glasgow Marriott on August 29.
The event will see the unveiling of the new name under which candidates will stand next May, and the agreement of a policy platform.
Possible names include United Left, Left Alternative and Scottish Left.
Buoyed by the surge in interest in radical politics during the referendum, the coalition will target the Holyrood list system, where MSPs can be elected with just 5.2 per cent of the vote.
Although some Scottish Socialist party (SSP) members oppose the idea, the SSP will not field candidates in its own name, but only as part of the new coalition, in order to maximise the chances of socialist MSPs being elected.
The umbrella model is based on Syriza in Greece, which was formed in 2004 as a coalition of 13 radical groups, including Maoists, Trotskyists, feminists and environmentalists.
Representatives from Syriza, Spain's Podemos movement and the radical Quebec Solidaire coalition in Canada are already working with the Scottish group.
The August conference aims to agree a "common programme of the left" and discuss how to emulate the electoral success of similar left movements elsewhere.
There will also be a series of meetings and assemblies across Scotland in coming months.
A Scottish Left Project spokesman said: "We want to ensure that in 2016 the radical political awakening that emerged during the referendum can be clearly and unequivocally expressed at the ballot box. This conference will herald the start of what we hope will be the largest campaign of the radical left in over a decade."
A webcam app for light painting in real-time. Now for Mac & Windows.
Update: Google recently closed the Chrome app store, so Mercury Pro is FREE until further notice.
Only captures the brightest light. Allows painting for a very long time without over-exposing the picture.
Frequently asked questions
Can I use a DSLR with LPL?
Yes, but it requires 3rd party software. Generally the video feed from DSLR to webcam is low resolution and low framerate.
extrawebcam
Can I record light painting videos?
Yes, by using any screen-casting program. We use screencast-o-matic and Quicktime (mac).
How can I get rid of noise?
Most webcams default to using auto-exposure. This is not ideal for light painting. In complete darkness, it will use the maximum exposure, which makes the video very noisy (like high ISO). Use your webcam's driver software to control settings on the webcam, or use a universal webcam controller like Webcam Settings (Mac).
Of course, the quality of the camera also affects this. We recommend Logitech webcams, like the C930e
How can I fade out my light painting?
Short fades are possible by switching modes; like 'light' to 'fade'.
The formula below can be used to determine the duration of the fades. Each frame will subtract 1 from the current color, of which there are 256 possible values.
256 (color values) / 60 (frames per second) = 4.3 seconds

Red and blue lights and a welcoming message that reads in French 'Welcome, Neymar!' adorn the Eiffel Tower in Paris to celebrate the arrival of the Brazilian football star, on August 5, 2017 (AFP Photo/OLIVIER MORIN)
Paris (AFP) - French police arrested an intruder brandishing a knife at the Eiffel Tower on Saturday night which led the monument to be evacuated, sources said.
The man, who is aged around 19 and has a history of psychological problems, forced his way past security guards and then shouted "Allahu Akbar" ("God is Greatest"), a legal source told AFP.
Armed soldiers who are permanently stationed at the Eiffel Tower ordered him to drop his weapon, which he did without attacking anyone, the source said, asking not to be named.
The man, who was apparently alone, was "very quickly overpowered and arrested" and nobody was hurt, a statement from the company that runs the monument said.
After the arrest, police at the site checked the venue and called for it to be evacuated at around 00:30, 15 minutes before the Eiffel Tower normally closes, the statement added.
The intruder was wearing a Paris Saint-Germain football shirt. At the time of the incident the tower was lit up with the colours of the team to welcome the club's new world-record signing, Brazilian star Neymar.
France has been under a state of emergency since the November 2015 attacks on Paris restaurants, a concert venue and a sports stadium that left 130 people dead.
Since the first wave of terror attacks in January 2015, 239 people have been killed.
The legal source said the man with the knife, a Frenchman born in the West African state of Mauritania, had been discharged from a psychiatric hospital in July.
The tower reopened on Sunday morning as usual at 09:00 am (0700 GMT).
Choosing the right number of PGs (“placement groups”) for your cluster is a bit of black art–and a usability nightmare. Getting a reasonable value can have a big impact on a cluster's performance and reliability, both in a good way and a bad way. Unfortunately, over the past few years we've seen our share of the bad ways. In Luminous we've taken major steps to finally eliminate one of the most common ways to drive your cluster into a ditch, and looking forward we aim to eventually hide PGs entirely so that they are not something most users will ever have to know or think about.
Background
Objects in RADOS are stored in logical pools. Each pool is sharded into pg_num placement groups (PGs), so that each PG contains some fragment of the overall pool's objects. If it is a replicated PG, you'll get identical copies of those objects on each OSD that CRUSH decides the PGs should be mapped to. If it's an erasure coded pool, each PG instance contains a different shard of each object in the PG, such that object's content can be reconstructed from k out of the k+m PG instances. Thus, if you have a 3x replicated pool with 128 PGs, you will have 384 PG instances spread across however many OSDs you have. If it were a 8+3 erasure pool it would be 1408 PG instances.
PGs serve two main purposes:
Data distribution. In particular, if a single OSD fails, the other copies of the PGs it stores are spread across lots of other OSDs, such that when the cluster repairs itself the work is parallelized across lots of sources and targets across the cluster, reducing the recovery time and impact. Parallelism within the OSD. Inside each OSD, we use the PGs to shard work to allow parallelism across cores and reduce lock contention.
The rule of thumb is that you want somewhere around 100 PG instances per OSD. If you have way less than that the load distribution won't be as balanced (some OSDs will store more than others), and if you have too many more than that then each OSD will be coordinating with too many other OSDs, increasing overhead and reducing overall reliability.
Changing pg_num
The reason why picking a decent PG count is important is that the pg_num value for a pool can be increased–splitting and migrating existing PGs into smaller pieces–but cannot be decreased. Splitting is comparatively easy to implement (and has been possible since Bobtail), so if you undershoot the PG count or your cluster grows over time you can fix it. If you have too many PGs, though, you can't yet merge them back together. (We are looking at adding this capability, but it is a release or two away.) Also, even though you can split PGs, doing so is a relatively expensive operation. For example, doubling the PG count will move half of the data in your cluster.
For this reason many operators have chosen to overshoot the recommended PG count with the expectation that the cluster is going to grow. Until that growth materializes, the cluster will perform suboptimally. More commonly, operators simply don't have a good idea what value to choose and end up with something that is less than ideal (or make use of an automated deployment tool that makes a bad choice for them).
Problems with past intervals
Simply having lots of PGs isn't usually problematic on its own. However, if the cluster becomes unhealthy, and especially if it remains unhealthy for an extended period of time, a combination of effects can cause problems.
In order to facilitate correct recovery after OSD failures and/or PG migrations to other OSDs, each PG keeps track of what are called past intervals since the PG was last “clean” or completely healthy. An interval in this case is a period of time during which the system decided the PG should be stored on a particular set of OSDs. When a system is “thrashing”–for example, when OSDs are stopping and restarting and stopping again due to a flaky network or unreliable hardware or some misconfiguration–lots of past intervals can be generated in a short period of time, and we have to remember all of them. If these changes happen quickly, before data actually migrates to the new location(s), the list of past intervals can grow quite large. If a cluster is unhealthy for an extended period of time (e.g., days or even weeks), the past interval set can become large enough to require a significant amount of memory. And, if the system is configured with lots of PGs (perhaps more than it should have), the problem gets even worse because past interval sets are maintained for each PG.
In extreme cases the OSD daemons can end up consuming so much memory that they are killed by the kernel. Then they are restarted automatically by the init system (or an administrator) and the cluster state change generates yet another interval to add to the past intervals set, making the problem just a little bit worse. The longer this goes on, the deeper the hole that the system has to climb back out of.
Problems with the “min in” limit
Unlike convention RAID systems, Ceph subscribes to the philosophy that a “standby” device is a wasted device: why not make use of the drive now, and later, when there is a failure, spread the remaining work across the surviving devices? This generally works beautifully when a small number of devices fail. Each time an OSD fails, the data is squeezed a bit more onto the remaining OSDs.
Eventually, however, we have to decide that this can't go on indefinitely. The mon_osd_min_in_ratio configuration parameter controls the minimum fraction of all OSDs in the system that have to be “in” (i.e., online and actually storing data) in order for another down OSD to be marked “out” and for its data to be re-replicated onto the remaining OSDs. Until recently this value defaulted to .3, or 30%, which meant that if you started out with a cluster with 100 PGs per OSD, and steadily failed each one, your data would keep collapsing down onto a smaller and smaller set until eventually the surviving 30% of the OSDs would have more than 300 PGs each.
The combination of the above two issues has led several clusters into apparent death spirals where the OSDs were unable to start or recover without various heroic measures by administrators and developers to reduce their memory requirements and nurse them back to health.
Fixing all of it in Luminous
After seeing this a few times and pulling out the same bag of tricks to get clusters back online it was clear there were several things we could do to prevent this going forward. First, the easy things:
We increased the mon_osd_min_in_ratio to a more reasonable default of .75, which means that once 25% of your devices have failed the cluster will stop trying to heal on its own and require some operator intervention. Of course, you can adjust this to whatever makes sense in your environment.
of .75, which means that once 25% of your devices have failed the cluster will stop trying to heal on its own and require some operator intervention. Of course, you can adjust this to whatever makes sense in your environment. We put some better limits around the PG counts you could use in a cluster. There is now a mon_max_pg_per_osd limit (default: 200) that prevents you from creating new pools or adjusting pg_num or replica count for existing pools if it pushes you over the configured limit (as determined by dividing the total number of PG instances by the total number of “in” OSDs). Again, if you really need to, you can increase the limit, but 2x the recommendation seems like a reasonable point to prevent users from making trouble for themselves.
The real problems, though, were the high memory usage for past intervals and the fact that it was possible for the cluster–through whatever sequence of failures or misconfigurations–to try to cram too many PGs onto a single OSD.
Past intervals memory
One of the main behind-the-scenes refactors leading up to the Luminous release was a rewrite of the past interval tracking. Previously, we would keep a list all intervals since the PG was last clean, mark which ones could have potentially included writes, and keep that list around (sharing it gratuitously) until the PG was eventually fully “clean” again. It turns out that knowing the full history of PG locations is a lot more information than we really need, however. What the PG peering algorithm actually needs to know is which OSDs it needs to contact during peering in order to be certain it has discovered any past updates, and that can be derived from the (roughly speaking) “set of minimal sets” of OSDs that may have processed updates. When the past intervals tracking structure was rebuilt around exactly the information required, it became extremely compact and relatively insensitive to extended periods of cluster unhealthiness, eliminating the source of memory growth that caused so many problems. Hooray!
Hard limit on PGs on each OSD
The other core problem was that any individual OSDs were ever allowed to instantiate more PGs than they could handle. Because PG mappings are the result of a mathematical calculation in CRUSH, any number of CRUSH or cluster state changes could potentially lead to a situation where CRUSH put too many PGs in one place. Even if we fixed the “min in” problem above, some other scenario or misconfiguration could potentially lead to too many PGs on one OSD.
In Luminous, we've added a hard limit on the number of PGs that can be instantiated on a single OSD, expressed as osd_max_pg_per_osd_hard_ratio, a multiple of the mon_max_pg_per_osd limit (the limit we mentioned above that prevents you from configuring too many PGs). If any individual OSD is ever asked to create more PGs than it should it will simply refuse and ignore the request. The cluster will be partially unavailable if that happens (those PGs won't be able to peer and service IO until the data distribution is corrected), but we will avoid putting the system into a situation where it may have a hard time recovering. Hopefully an administrator has been alerted and become involved long before this, but in cases of extreme neglect, the system won't dig itself into a hole.
Conclusion
Hearing about things that used to go wrong but can't anymore isn't as much fun as reading about shiny new features, but we hope it will let users that have experienced some of these issues (or skirted less extreme instances) rest easier. We certainly sleep much better these days!
Earth Day This Year Will Be Honoured With A March For The Sake Of Science
Earth Day has been celebrated on April 22nd every year since 1970. This day was chosen in order to bring the issues of the world into the public eye, at least one day a year. Earth Day stands to show just how fragile nature and the entire living eco-system is in regards to even the slightest changes of the planet.
But while scientists and environmentalists held this day in high regard, this year, however, Earth Day is even more important. Not only is the environment, and by extension, our very way of life as we know it, in danger, but now science itself -the thing that brought pretty much everything man-made we see around us today – is in the same peril.
This is why people will organise and take part in the March for Science this year during Earth Day. The current administration is no longer interested in the opinion and advice of the experts – people who've dedicated their entire lives to learn and understand the workings of different branches of science – and instead focus on their immediate needs according to their own level of understanding. This is why the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is now in danger, the organisation that aims to take science out of the labs and into the real world.
The organisers of the March for Science invite everyone to join who is a believer in scientific research and fact and evidence-based policies. The main event will take place in Washington, D.C on the 22nd of April, during Earth Day, but there will also be another 100 satellite protests all across the globe. If you want to take part in the event or to kept up to date on various events, then check out the March for Science homepage.

They say Americans think enforcement is too costly
Writers: Polls shows more in U.S. favor legalizing pot for adults
Writers: Pot legalization is not a matter of "if," it's a matter of "when"
Despite decades of propaganda from marijuana prohibitionists, a majority of the American public has indeed said "enough" to the policies of cannabis criminalization. And no amount of fear-mongering is going to change this fact.
Writing in a just-published report by the Brookings Institute, "The New Politics of Legalization," authors E.J. Dionne and William Galston conclude, "In less than a decade, public opinion has shifted dramatically toward support for the legalization of marijuana. ... Demographic change and widespread public experience using marijuana imply that opposition to legalization will never again return to the levels seen in the 1980s. The strong consensus that formed the foundation for many of today's stringent marijuana laws has crumbled."
Indeed it has. Never in modern history has there existed greater public support for ending the nation's nearly century-long experiment with pot prohibition and replacing it with a system of legalization and regulation. The proof is in the polls.
For example, according to a May 2013 Reason Magazine-Rupe nationwide survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, more than nine out of 10 U.S. adults say that people who possess or consume small quantities of cannabis should not face jail time.
Allen St. Pierre
Paul Armentano
Also last month, a May 2013 nationwide Fox News telephone poll, conducted by under the direction of Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Co. Research, reported that 85% of voters support allowing adults to use cannabis for therapeutic purposes. The total is an increase in support of 4 percentage points since Fox last polled the question in 2010 and is the highest level of public support for the issue ever reported in a scientific poll.
Then there is this: An April 2013 national survey commissioned by the Pew Research Center reports that 72% of Americans now believe that "government efforts to enforce marijuana laws cost more than they are worth," and 60% say the government should no longer enforce federal anti-marijuana laws in states that have approved its use.
And this: According to a December 2012 Angus Reid national sampling of U.S .voters, 66% say that they expect cannabis to be legal within the next 10 years.
Pew, And finally there's this: recently published polls by Gallup, Quinnipiac University and Public Policy Polling all find that far more Americans now favor legalizing marijuana for adults than believe in its continued prohibition. Why? The answer has become obvious. The ongoing enforcement of cannabis prohibition burdens taxpayers, encroaches upon civil liberties, engenders disrespect for the law, impedes legitimate scientific research into the plant's medicinal properties, and disproportionately impacts communities of color. Furthermore, the criminalization of cannabis simply doesn't work.
Despite more than 70 years of federal prohibition, Americans' consumption of and demand for cannabis is here to stay. Voters' recent passage of legalization measures in Colorado and Washington acknowledges this reality. Such laws seek to take control of the marijuana market from untaxed criminal enterprises and, to impose common-sense regulations governing cannabis' personal use by adults and licensing its production.

Unlike the federal government, which continues to define cannabis as an illegal commodity that is as dangerous as heroin, voters recognize that a pragmatic regulatory framework that allows for limited, licensed production and sale of cannabis to adults but restricts use among young people best reduces the risks associated with its use or abuse.
Marijuana regulations can allow governments to establish legal parameters for where, when, and how markets operate. They can provide oversight of who may legally operate in those markets and provides guidelines for best practices. Society would clearly benefit from this. Only criminals and cartels benefit from the unregulated environment.
Maybe an even more persuasive if not entirely counter-intuitive argument in favor of legalization as a means to actually deter youth use is found in recently released Gallup polling indicating a dramatic reduction in youth cannabis use rate as there is a surge in favor of cannabis legalization from virtually all segments of American society.
It is time to end our failed policies on marijuana criminalization and replace them with ones that regulate the cannabis market and allow for its private consumption by adults.
Marijuana legalization is no longer a matter of if; it's a matter of when.

TLDR
ppsl qualifiers
- yoonyj was promised a flight and spot as replacement for targa.
- did not materialise. reason was awaiting funds. (ALSO in the contract there was nothing that said that IGN would be paying for the flight)
- ipl states that payments were on schedule.
- moonglade was asked to represent azk and join azk for 3 months in return for spot and flight but he declined.
- azksickness joins azk recently and gets a free spot and flight without having to go through the qualifiers.
- players from filipino team 'Cube' was denied flights.
- both azk players was given walkovers in group e over rixilius and salt who coincidentally are from 'Cube'
ppsl
- audience did not get the vip privileges (interaction with players, autographs, etc) they paid for on day 1 (usd10). ticketing has no clue.
- stream testing only start 1 hour before event. no sound proofing. not enough ram.
- players have no idea what is going on and the brackets.
- hon players that registered for hon tournament arrive and realise there is no hon tournament. s2 funds unaccounted for.
azk
- some azk members are known for their notoriety online. zanooku/ziek banned from bnet forums and sc2sea after numerous counts of trolling and racism.
- negative comments removed from facebook page
Torch + Gunrun on Fuck Slasher

Summary of !@#$ Slasher (Torch and Thegunrun's story):
- Torch was only there with an informal role to provide assistance and support to Korean players (if needed). TheGunrun was there to provide streaming assistance and to ensure event went alright since Twitch.tv was a sponsor.
- venue was set up relatively late (11pm the night before)
- internet was slow
- Gus was not around and uncontactabele till about 2-3pm the first day and it was chaos as no one knew what was happening the first day or who to talk to to get things done.
- they eventually got internet faster (thanks to the ISP), they realize there were problems with hardware as well.
- Gus was around for most of the time after that, but wasn't really doing much to assist with production, just preparing his "apology" speech, which eventually became a "thank you for watching, we made it" speech.
- Torch said that Gus said he was intending to hold another HoN tournament to pay off the $2k, but suspects it could be a way of waving off the heat.
- Gus has been AWOL since the end of the tournament
- AZK crew and production staff were very responsive to helping Torch and Thegunrun
- Despite the "fake" VIP passes, in general crowd feedback was good.
- TheGunrun: Mineski production/organization/stream (WCG Phillipines qualifiers/Pinoy Gaming Festival) was so much better than this event. This is an isolated event. Please don't hate the Filipinos
- LiviB and CheekyDuck had always been scheduled to cast as far as Torch and TheGunrun knew. And frankly they needed more than 1 set of casters for an event that long.
- Naniwa vs Sen was delayed because it was lagging and there were sound issues (insufficient noise cancellation).
- Torch and TheGunrun are looking to set up a Reddit AMA sometime in the future to clarify some of the accusations and try to shed more light on the fiasco (what is real, what is not)
And that is all I guess. Looks like this Gus guy can't really get out of this mess anymore.

There are too many scumbags from too many corners of the world who will do this kind of shit over and over and over. The prize-money involved, a majority of the time, is these players livelihood as pro-gamers. I understand that it's IPL's money that this guy has run off with, but there needs to be a governing body for StarCraft players to ensure this doesn't happen.
Surely with a community as large as ours we have some lawyers or legal-minded people who can shed some light on the implications of stupid shit such as this.

Depending on how long you've been following Zelda news on the Internet, you may or may not remember a supposed game known as “Project Deluge,” or “Valley of the Flood.” Back in 2008, a secret interview between Eiji Aonuma and a mysterious person known only as “Kyle” was leaked on the IGN forums. In it, Aonuma revealed what he described as the next Zelda title, and, at the time, there was virtually no information present on what was then known as “Zelda Wii.” As such, this was massive news. He described a darker, more technologically advanced world in which a well-intentioned but delusional boy took on the persona of the Hero of Time in order to defeat Ganondorf and prevent the world from being flooded by the goddesses. Sound familiar?
“Valley of the Flood” was described as a prequel to The Wind Waker, revealing the details of what happened when, as stated in The Wind Waker's introductory sequence, “the hero did not appear.” Taking place in an apocalyptic Hyrule, the game would have the player act as this would-be Link, only to know that, in the end, the deluge would claim Hyrule, and The Great Sea would drown out the world below.
Of course, this was later confirmed to be a completely false rumor—Eiji Aonuma never gave this interview, and Nintendo was never working on a secret project called “Valley of the Flood.” Besides, we now have Skyward Sword as our promised Zelda title for the Wii. However, looking back at the details of the proposed storyline and how fans reacted to it may let us know what direction that the Zelda series should take in the future.
“Someday… When this seal is broken… That is when I will exterminate your descendants!!” – Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time
The Great Flood
At the end of Ocarina of Time, Ganondorf is sealed in The Sacred Realm by the sages, and Link is sent back in time. However, Zelda still carries on in that time stream, now known as “The Adult Timeline.” According to Hyrule Historia, the following age of history is known as “The Era without a Hero.” Sometime during this era, Ganondorf is revived, and the Hero of Time—or even a new Link, for that matter—does not appear to stop his torrential rise to power. The goddesses flood Hyrule, and the world of The Wind Waker is created. It is during that dark time in which “Valley of the Flood” would supposedly take place.
“The people believed that the Hero of Time would again come to save them. …But the hero did not appear.” – in-game prologue of The Wind Waker
The Interview
In the interview (which, keep in mind, was 100% fake), Aonuma describes the player as feeling a “greater sense of psychological peril,” perhaps even greater than the doomsday scenario seen in Majora's Mask. Revealing that his desire to have a more detailed storyline feature in a Zelda game had finally triumphed over Miyamoto's rule of “simplicity and straightforwardness,” Aonuma asserts that the hero would no longer be mute. “Because he isn't Link, right?” Kyle asks. Aonuma then goes on to describe the story of the game's playable character.
“…Because the hero is not Link this time, there is much more flexibility in terms of storytelling. I want to stress the craziness of the hero. Because this hero is not Link, but he thinks he is Link.” When the Hero of Time did not appear to slay the revived Ganondorf, this young boy, more physically mature than Link had ever been, convinces himself that he is, in fact, the new Link. With “black hair and more defined musculature,” the boy becomes obsessed, eventually getting his own green tunic, forging a Master Sword replica, and taking on other Link-like traits.
However, despite his not actually being Link, the boy begins to fight the minions of Ganondorf, and, of course, would have succeeded to some level—after all, what's the point of playing a Zelda game if you can't defeat bosses and complete dungeons? Additionally, his own faltering insanity was said to mirror that of Ganondorf's. The banished Gerudo king's long tenure of imprisonment in The Sacred Realm had apparently made him more erratic and dangerous: “He's basically gone mad and the game's cinematics will sometimes jump to him and show this madness overpowers him over the course of the game.”
Another supposed change to the Zelda series would be to update the time period and general tone. As stated by the fake Aonuma, “many fans tell me that they're interested in a steampunk-influenced Zelda, even though the series has always maintained a very medieval foundation.” However, in keeping with the series' fantasy roots, a gun, for example, would not be a weapon in the real-world sense, but rather a sort of “deku musket that fires gunpowder-filled deku nuts.”
The large size of the world would also change the tone of the game, bringing about the need for new modes of transportation. In addition to the pseudo-Link's horse—“a black one…with these ethereal white spots that illuminate in the dark”—the game would feature an expansive railway system, something that, according to the false Aonuma statement, the Zelda team had wanted to implement into a game since Majora's Mask (perhaps by coincidence, Spirit Tracks achieved this only one year after this “interview,” in 2009). The massive overworld would feature dozens of side-quests, mini-dungeons, and would graphically showcase a sense of “realism and consistency… such as believable rivers and brooks and water effects.”
Finally, the main focus of the game, aside from defeating Ganondorf, that is, was to rescue the various peoples of Hyrule and influence them to migrate to the mountains in order to survive the impending flood. If this were true, it would finally explain the full backstory of how and why some Hyruleans were chosen to be saved and left to form the small island villages seen in The Wind Waker.
Aonuma and Kyle's discussion concluded with the promise that the interview would not be released until after E3 2008, one month later. This was a lie, of course, but one of little consequence, since the entire interview itself was a lie.
“This is but one of the legends of which the people speak…” – in-game prologue of The Wind Waker
Four Years Later
It's been nearly half a decade since that fake interview was released back in the summer of 2008, and, looking back, some people may ask how anyone could have possibly believed that such an outlandish scenario could have ever been in a Zelda game. As the saying goes, though, hindsight is 20/20, and many fans did actually believe that this was a true representation of what was to come for Zelda Wii—or, at least, they hoped that it might be in a real Zelda game. Others claimed that this was a clear sham, asserting that Aonuma would never reveal such detailed information about a future game before its E3 reveal, in addition to the fact that the proposed storyline was far too dark for a Zelda title.
Still, despite “Valley of the Flood's” radical premise, its inclusion of steampunk elements was praised by optimistic fans, and the idea of an expansive world with units of transportation previously unseen in the Zelda franchise was lauded by many gamers. Except in minute ways, neither of these elements has since been fully integrated into any new Zelda game.
What Do You Think?
Were you around when “Valley of the Flood” was first proposed as Zelda Wii? If so, what was your opinion of it then, and has it changed at all over the past four years?
If this is the first time you've heard of “Project Deluge,” which of its elements would you be interested in seeing implemented into a future Zelda game, if any at all?

When Jasmyne was 12, her mom gave her a sex talk that the teen told BuzzFeed News "scarred her" for life.
It involved a cucumber and a lemon, she said.
Recently, mom and daughter were hanging out with Jasmyne's 15-year-old cousin, Zee, who is staying with them for the summer. Jasmyne began to reminisce about her mom's sex talk, and Charlene decided to re-create it.
"I already knew where it was going so I decided to record," Jasmyne said.
She added that the new version wasn't as bad as hers, because her mom used a knife instead of a cucumber.
"Fortunately we didn't have any cucumbers so she had to improvise — hence the knife — so it was not as graphic but still slightly disturbing," she said.
Samson Kambalu is a Malawian multimedia artist, author, filmmaker and professor at Oxford University. He is one of four cutting-edge international creatives to have recently joined the roster of the Goodman Gallery in Cape Town.
A collection of his short films, forming part of the Ghost Dance solo exhibition were on show at Goodman Gallery in Cape Town. They are motion pictures that showcase his unique approach to making films. The style Nyau Cinema is a fragmented kind of filmmaking that he came into contact with as a child growing up in Malawi.
The artist describes the way public screenings of lively Hollywood action films on the streets of Malawi would entertain onlookers, that reels of footage would be cut up and joined with other action sequences in the name of pure entertainment. These choppy amalgamations of iconic Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris films left such a mark on young Kambalu that it is now a central hallmark of his work.
“A lot of the projectors that were used in Malawi were old. They would break down all the time, so much so that the breaking down of film became part of the aesthetic. That has inspired the way I make film,” says Kambalu. “Some of the composition would be taken out as opposed to what you'd see in typical Western cinema for a passive audience – there's no such thing as a passive audience in Africa.”
This disjointed way of constructing stories is something Kambalu now celebrates as a feature in itself as the fragmented and repetitive shots keep the audience visually engaged in a more active way than long, sweeping scenes. He believes a non-Western way of crafting a narrative leads to more interesting questions, which is an approach he solidified earlier in his career while writing a book, The Jive Talker, based on the raconteur character of his father and his own life experiences as an African man living in Europe.
The Liberal government has scrapped the elaborate system Conservatives were using to organize central message control within the government, replacing it with… nothing, according to the Privy Council Office.
It's not just the scientists who've been unmuzzled. Anyone in the government who wants to organize a public event, or speak at one — and anyone who wants to talk to journalists — is affected by this change in policy.
The PCO, which acts as a support to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet, confirmed the shift this week.
Under this government, it is no longer using documents called “Message Event Proposals,” which came into practice under Stephen Harper's Conservatives, to vet events and media requests across the federal government. The documents “have not been replaced with something new,” said spokesperson Raymond Rivet.
“The PCO's new communications process looks like another positive step,” said Debi Daviau, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada.
The union represents about 57,000 government scientists and other professionals, mainly at the federal level of government. It has been one of the most vocal advocates for the government “unmuzzling” its scientists.
Though she said there's clear support for science from the Liberal government, Daviau warned that policies and directives are always at the whim of the government of the day, noting a “chill” under Harper.
“A lot of work needs to happen so that science is never silenced again by a federal government. What we need now is to safeguard it from future attacks and ensure we are consistent across government departments,” Daviau said.
Despite the shift at PCO, Rivet noted some departments might still use Message Event Proposals or similar products internally.
“Departments and ministers are responsible for their own communications, though co-ordination remains important,” said Olivier Duchesneau, a spokesperson for Trudeau. Some inquiries are still flagged to the PCO when more than one agency or department is involved, Rivet added.
Duchesneau said the government is basing its communications on the concept of “government by cabinet,” though he didn't comment specifically on the scrapped Harper-era system.

Dear Strictly Business Fans,We're officially announcing that we will not be attending UMG Nashville, sorry to inform you of this terrible news and especially to those who are attending the event that were looking forward to seeing us there. This article will explain why we have made the decision to not attend UMG Nashville.
Over the last couple of events there have been several different winners, this is not just from teams simply improving but from the skill gap being so small, so it all pretty much depends on teamwork and the individual performance of each player on the day. We're not looking into investing money for the event simply because we're not confident in the game anymore, but don't get us wrong, we're still a professional Call of Duty eSports organization and we will be waiting for the next Call of Duty title (Advanced Warfare).
This year has been huge for us as an organization, from winning Call of Duty Regionals to getting a top 4 placing at Call of Duty Champs and many other top placing's we've achieved after as well. So we hope that you, the #sBGNation can support this decision that we have made and will still continue to support us for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.
NEWARK -- Sixty-seven firefighters were sworn-in to their positions with the Newark fire division at a graduation ceremony Tuesday.
Federal homeland security grant money will fund the salaries for 40 of the newly-minted firefighters over the next two years, according to city officials. The latest group of rookie firefighters marked the city's largest-ever class of fire academy graduates, officials said.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose welcomed the firefighters with a public ceremony at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church.
"The Newark Fire Division has a long history of honor, courage and commitment, displaying valor by charging into the scene of disaster when others must flee, to save lives and property," the mayor said in a statement. "I call upon each new firefighter to serve the City of Newark with the dedication and distinction that has made our Fire Division an inspiration to our city's residents, youth and to the entire nation."
Firefighter recruits undergo a 13-week training academy, which includes physical tests and academic coursework. Recruits battle controlled fires, learn how to use a range of equipment and must pass certification tests.
Officials said the class represented a diverse group that included 22 Hispanic, 18 black, and 27 white graduates, including one woman, who joined seven other females in the fire division.
"The City of Newark's Fire Division is one of the greatest in the nation and it's important that we continue to grow and to build upon that success," Ambrose said. "The addition of these new firefighters will enhance our ability to deliver the invaluable services required to keep our city safe."
Newark merged its approximately 600-member fire department into divisions along with police and emergency management as part of the city Department of Public Safety last year.
Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect a corrected total of graduates provided by the Newark Department of Public Safety.

Google took the wraps off of Google Maps 5.7 for Android devices on Wednesday, and the software update adds quite a few new features. The most noteworthy addition is Google's Transit Navigation beta feature, which provides navigation instructions for public transportation in more than 400 cities around the globe. You don't have to leave it open, either. Once you've started your trip, Transit Navigation will automatically remind you with an alert when your stop is coming up. Google also made it easier to find driving or walking directions in one click, improved search suggestions with category icons, and added a photo viewer to the Places feature of Google Maps. The update is available free from the Android Market for devices running Android 2.1 or newer. Hit the jump for a video of Transit Navigation beta in action.

It's minus 13 C on an Ontario Sunday morning, and the Tim Hortons up at Highway 9, handily located between Orangeville and Shelburne, is doing brisk business. A steady stream of folks in SUVs and F-150s make their way to the drive-through window to collect their breakfast sandwiches and double-doubles. Their heavy parkas come from Mark's Work Wearhouse, not Patagonia.
This would be an excellent place for Justin Trudeau to start his listening tour.
Mr. Trudeau's listening tour, hastily announced last week, is damage control for the revelation that he and his family enjoyed a secret winter getaway at the Aga Khan's private island in the Bahamas. I don't know why anybody in the PMO thought they could keep it secret. Their attempts to do so (they cited privacy concerns) simply aroused the slumbering jackals of the media, who sniffed out the story within hours.
Story continues below advertisement
Margaret Wente: Trudeau's real problem: Pretending he's above money grubbing
Lawrence Martin: For Trudeau, a sour ending to a year of progress
A winter getaway in the sun is every Canadian's birthright, and no one begrudges the Trudeau family one of their own. But two things strike me as wrong-footed about his decision to accept the hospitality of the Aga Khan and his attempt to keep it off the record. First, his job involves a certain sacrifice of privacy, alas. People want to know where he's going, and they're not wrong to do so. Second, the optics. A villa in St. Kitts is one thing (see Christmas, 2015), but being hosted by a zillionaire with a private island, yachts and helicopters is a bit much – especially when your government has made a habit of donating millions of dollars to one of your host's philanthropic efforts. It looks a bit too chummy, to say nothing of a bit too 0.001 per cent. Barack Obama would never have made that mistake.
Mr. Trudeau may be the most popular prime minister we've had in quite a while, but he doesn't have the populist touch. Why would he? As a trust-fund baby, he was insulated from the ordinary anxieties of middle-class life – how to pay for university, make a living wage, save a down payment for a house, worry about the mortgage, find decent child care, gain name recognition. Instead of an F-150, he drove a classic Mercedes inherited from his dad. He inherited Dad's friends and connections too (which explains his surprisingly emotional encomiums to the late Fidel Castro). Both the Aga Khan and Fidel were honorary pallbearers at his father's funeral. Talk about an odd couple.
For better and for worse, the populist touch is critical to political survival these days. Tectonic plates are shifting because people think their ruling class is out of touch. Chrystia Freeland, one of Mr. Trudeau's more gifted ministers, even wrote a book, Plutocrats, about the problem of global elites who live 30,000 feet in the air as they jet from Davos to Shanghai, increasingly oblivious to the lives of the folks stuck on the ground below. Mr. Trudeau (unlike his predecessor) is utterly at home with those elites. But people stuck on the ground resent being ruled by pointy-heads from Harvard and Yale with their postnational obsessions. They're far more comfortable with a crude entrepreneur like Donald Trump, who, for all his flaws, at least builds stuff.
The concerns that animate Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau are not the concerns that animate the folks at Tim's. Mr. Trudeau is animated by carbon policies, social licence, aboriginal reconciliation, gender equality and peacekeeping missions in African hellholes to restore Canada's cred at the United Nations. Tim's folks are animated by job security, their kids' employment prospects, whether those kids will ever be able to afford a house in Southern Ontario, finding long-term care for Granny, and hydro bills that are exploding because of the provincial government's loony green schemes. They feel they're being nickel-and-dimed to death, with no end in sight. And they're right.
So here's some free advice for Mr. Trudeau on his listening tour. Dress warmly, preferably in something from Mark's. Paste a list of what matters to Canadians on the back of your smartphone. (Hint: Carbon pricing is pretty far down the list.) Next year, stay home and mingle with the 99 per cent as if you mean it. Who knows? You might even learn something.
A new bitcoin anonymization technology TRR (Transaction Remote Release) inspired by Tor has been revealed by Chinese researchers from the ATR Defense Science & Technology Lab at Shenzhen University.
The technology is said to be able to repulse a number of typical attack strategies, including the Sybil attack, Bitcoin protocol sniffers, as well as fake Bitcoin and TRR nodes attacks.
Anonymization is one of the Bitcoin digital currency's fields of development which has It's opposite in so-called "privacy-as-bug" phenomenon that reflects the current attitude of banks and governments towards cryptotechnology.
Whilst giving its due to the blockchain's ability to work cheaper and faster than traditional means of money transfer, its orientation towards anonymity and privacy is something that, they believe, should be eliminated. And thus there are emerging blockchain analysis tools such as Bitcoin Big Bang released in June by Elliptic which, aiming at enhanced transparency and preventing money laundering, in fact make bitcoin users vulnerable from the point of view of their privacy.
The new anonymization technology TRR is based on the same method as the one used by Tor, applying layer by layer an encryption-decryption process which makes it impossible to detect sender's IP.
“In the Bitcoin protocol, the only way that the attackers can connect the Bitcoin address with an IP address is in the process of releasing and spreading a new transaction. If we encrypt the new transaction and obfuscate the source IP of the sender then the attackers may not succeed,” reads the original research paper.
The main drawback of the technology is that it requires the original bitcoin protocol to be changed, which is hardly possible when the transparency trend is now becoming more and more widespread.
Still, experts say, it may be used in the sidechain, the technology which is currently developed by Blockstream and explored by the largest bank of Switzerland, UBS.

It is only available to 50 customers at selected stores in the Philippines over a two-day period, ending today.
However some took to social media to express their disappointment as the hot dog failed to satisfy their taste buds.
On the day of its launch, yesterday, KFC announced that its 'outrageously meaty KFC Double Down Dog have been sold out in all participating stores'.
While the new addition as been described as the 'meatiest original recipe chicken fillet with a tender juicy chick'n cheese hot dog topped with honey mustard and relish dressing', it wasn't so appetising when customers made their purchase.
'It's very disappointing that there's no more truth in advertising. Look at this double down dog that I got. NOT WORTH IT,' one unimpressed customer wrote after posting a photo of his hot dog on KFC's Facebook page.
Others embraced the new addition and were excited to try it out.
'We must try this,' a customer wrote as she tagged a friend.
'Damn I want,' another wrote.
KFC's new hot dog has ditched the piece of bread and is instead served wrapped in a fried chicken breast in exchange for the piece of bread
It appears Filipino customers were eager to take a bite out of the meaty treat
On the day of its launch, yesterday, KFC announced that its 'outrageously meaty KFC Double Down Dog have been sold out in all participating stores'
Sadly for American KFC enthusiasts, the fast-food giant says there are no plans to add the fatty fried treat to menus in US stores.
The hot dog entombed in fried chicken calls to mind KFC's infamous Double Down sandwich, which was introduced in select locations in the US back in 2010.

Medicinal cannabis will soon be legal in Queensland, after state parliament unanimously passed the Public Health (Medicinal Cannabis) Bill 2016 on Wednesday night. The new law will come into effect from March 2017.
Medicinal cannabis is already legal in both Victoria and New South Wales, but Queensland's new legislation has a very different framework—establishing two different pathways for medicinal cannabis treatment. The first gives specialist doctors, such as oncologists, the ability to prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients with certain conditions without state approval. The second concerns non-specialist doctors, like local GPs, who are able to apply for permission from a government body to prescribe cannabis for patients suffering from certain conditions.
In contrast, the Victorian Access to Medicinal Cannabis Act 2016 gives patients access to medicinal cannabis products, but use is restricted to children suffering from severe epilepsy. In New South Wales, the state's Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations require every patient to be considered by an expert panel before getting access to medicinal cannabis treatment.
Introducing the bill, Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick said that he was proud to be progressing a "groundbreaking reform."
"This bill will change the paradigm for seriously ill patients who feel compelled to seek out illicit cannabis treatment options by enshrining in an act a legal and safe pathway through which to access medicinal cannabis treatment," he told Parliament.
Minister Dick labelled the new two-tiered medicinal cannabis laws "the most flexible in the country," although the process for qualifying for treatment from a local GP will still be heavily regulated. A patient's application for medicinal cannabis will be assessed not only by the symptoms of their condition, but also by their history of drug dependence.
So where will the cannabis come from? Cultivating medicinal marijuana was made legal across Australia earlier this year, so long as you have a license. So far, only New South Wales and Victoria have taken advantage of the new law—it remains to be seen whether Queensland will follow them.
Tuesday was a big day for medicinal cannabis debate in Australia, with Tasmanian Parliament voting down a bill introduced by the Greens to quarantine patients from prosecution while they wait for the state's new medicinal cannabis laws to come into effect in April 2017.

A basic understanding of Swift and Node.js is needed to follow this tutorial.
In this article we are going to demonstrate how to create a public anonymous chat application on iOS. This will hopefully show you how easy it can actually be to create your very own chat application and also how you can use Pusher to integrate some real-time functionality into it.
This article assumes you already have working knowledge on Swift and XCode. You will also need to have a Pusher application set up. You can get a free Pusher account by clicking here.
When you are creating a pusher application, don't forget to select a cluster and make sure it is the same cluster used when defining the keys in your application
What we will be building
Our application will be a highly ephemeral application that does not save state. We will be using Pusher to send the messages and listen for new ones on the application. We will also build a web app using Node to be the server side app that handles the Pusher event triggers.
Setting up your project
The first thing you will need to do is create a new XCode project. When you have created a new project we will use Cocoapods to manage the dependencies the application might currently have. If you have not done so already, install Cocoapods on your machinne.
$ gem install cocoapods
Now to use Cocoapods in our application, cd to the code directory and run pod init
This will create a Podfile and this is where we will define our dependencies for the application.
Open the Podfile in your text editor of choice and replace with the content below:
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project platform :ios, '9.0' target 'anonchat' do # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks use_frameworks! # Pods for anonchat pod 'Alamofire' pod 'PusherSwift' pod 'JSQMessagesViewController' end
After you are done, run the command pod install and this will download the dependencies specified in the Podfile . When this is complete, close XCode (if open) and then open the .xcworkspace file that is in the root of your project folder.
Creating the necessary views
For login, we have decided to keep it simple. Since this is an anonymous chat application, we will generate the username for the user internally.
Create the login view using the storyboard interface builder. Below you can see what I have created using the builder. The "Login anonymously" button would be the trigger to push the next controller in.
The next controller is a navigation controller. This will be the one loaded after the login button is clicked. This in turn has a root controller which is out ChatViewController and this extends the JSQMessagesViewController which will give us the chat-like interface automatically. Neat right?
Here is the storyboard after all the pieces have been assembled:
Coding the logic into the views
Now that we have created the views and interface necessary to work with the application, we need to write some code. Create a ChatViewController and associate it to the chat view that we created above.
Now we need to extend the ChatViewController so we will enjoy the goodness our JSQMessagesViewController provides. We will also need to import all the dependencies we need at the top:
import UIKit import Alamofire import PusherSwift import JSQMessagesViewController class ChatViewController: JSQMessagesViewController { }
Now let us start adding functionality to the controller.
First, we want to add a messages array that will contain all the messages in this current session. Then we will create a Pusher instance that will listen for new messages and then append the message to the messages array.
import UIKit import Alamofire import PusherSwift import JSQMessagesViewController class ChatViewController: JSQMessagesViewController { var messages = [JSQMessage]() var pusher : Pusher! override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() listenForNewMessages() } private func listenForNewMessages() { let options = PusherClientOptions( host: .cluster("PUSHER_CLUSTER") ) pusher = Pusher(key: "ENTER_PUSHER_KEY_HERE", options: options) let channel = pusher.subscribe("chatroom") let _ = channel.bind(eventName: "new_message", callback: { (data: Any?) -> Void in if let data = data as? [String: AnyObject] { let author = data["sender"] as! String if author != self.senderId { let text = data["text"] as! String self.addMessage(senderId: author, name: author, text: text) self.finishReceivingMessage(animated: true) } } }) pusher.connect() } private func addMessage(senderId: String, name: String, text: String) { if let message = JSQMessage(senderId: senderId, displayName: name, text: text) { messages.append(message) } } }
So above in the viewDidLoad method, we called listenForNewMessages which does as it is titled and listens for new Pusher events/messages. Then it calls the addMessage method which appends to the messages array.
The next thing we want to do is customise our chat interface using the JSQMessagesViewController class we are currently extending.
First we will define some properties in the ChatViewController class:
var incomingBubble: JSQMessagesBubbleImage! var outgoingBubble: JSQMessagesBubbleImage!
Next, we will customise the interface in the viewDidLoad :
override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() inputToolbar.contentView.leftBarButtonItem = nil incomingBubble = JSQMessagesBubbleImageFactory().incomingMessagesBubbleImage(with: UIColor.jsq_messageBubbleBlue()) outgoingBubble = JSQMessagesBubbleImageFactory().outgoingMessagesBubbleImage(with: UIColor.jsq_messageBubbleGreen()) collectionView!.collectionViewLayout.incomingAvatarViewSize = CGSize.zero collectionView!.collectionViewLayout.outgoingAvatarViewSize = CGSize.zero automaticallyScrollsToMostRecentMessage = true collectionView?.reloadData() collectionView?.layoutIfNeeded() listenForNewMessages() }
We will also continue customising the interface by overriding some of the methods provided by the JSQMessagesViewController . Let's add these methods to our ChatViewController
override func collectionView(_ collectionView: JSQMessagesCollectionView!, messageDataForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath!) -> JSQMessageData! { return messages[indexPath.item] } override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int { return messages.count } override func collectionView(_ collectionView: JSQMessagesCollectionView!, messageBubbleImageDataForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath!) -> JSQMessageBubbleImageDataSource! { let message = messages[indexPath.item] if message.senderId == senderId { return outgoingBubble } else { return incomingBubble } } override func collectionView(_ collectionView: JSQMessagesCollectionView!, avatarImageDataForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath!) -> JSQMessageAvatarImageDataSource! { return nil } override func didPressSend(_ button: UIButton, withMessageText text: String, senderId: String, senderDisplayName: String, date: Date) { postMessage(name: senderId, message: text) addMessage(senderId: senderId, name: senderId, text: text) self.finishSendingMessage(animated: true) } private func setupOutgoingBubble() -> JSQMessagesBubbleImage { let bubbleImageFactory = JSQMessagesBubbleImageFactory() return bubbleImageFactory!.outgoingMessagesBubbleImage(with: UIColor.jsq_messageBubbleBlue()) } private func setupIncomingBubble() -> JSQMessagesBubbleImage { let bubbleImageFactory = JSQMessagesBubbleImageFactory() return bubbleImageFactory!.incomingMessagesBubbleImage(with: UIColor.jsq_messageBubbleGreen()) }
Next we have to automatically generate the username for the user so in the viewDidLoad method let's add the following:
let n = Int(arc4random_uniform(1000)) senderId = "anonymous" + String(n) senderDisplayName = senderId
This will create a username 'anonymous' plus a random number between 0 and 999. That should suffice for now.
The final piece of the puzzle now is adding the postMessage method which will post the message to our Node application backend. That application will send the message down to Pusher and it will be ready for pickup by any listener on that Pusher channel.
private func postMessage(name: String, message: String) { let params: Parameters = ["sender": name, "text": message] Alamofire.request(ChatViewController.API_ENDPOINT + "/messages", method: .post, parameters: params).validate().responseJSON { response in switch response.result { case .success: // Succeeded, do something print("Succeeded") case .failure(let error): // Failed, do something print(error) } } }
We will also have to define this property ChatViewController.API_ENDPOINT
static let API_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:4000";
We will be using local host but if you already have it online that is great too.
Building the backend Node application
Now that we are done with the iOS and XCode parts, we can create the NodeJS back end for the application. We are going to be using Express, so that we can quickly whip something up.
Create a directory for the web application and then create two new files:
// index.js var path = require('path'); var Pusher = require('pusher'); var express = require('express'); var bodyParser = require('body-parser'); var app = express(); var pusher = new Pusher({ appId: 'PUSHER_APP_ID', key: 'PUSHER_APP_KEY', secret: 'PUSHER_APP_SECRET', cluster: 'PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER', encrypted: true }); app.use(bodyParser.json()); app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false })); app.post('/messages', function(req, res){ var message = { text: req.body.text, sender: req.body.sender } pusher.trigger('chatroom', 'new_message', message); res.json({success: 200}); }); app.use(function(req, res, next) { var err = new Error('Not Found'); err.status = 404; next(err); }); module.exports = app; app.listen(4000, function(){ console.log('App listening on port 4000!') })
and packages.json
{ "main": "index.js", "dependencies": { "body-parser": "^1.16.0", "express": "^4.14.1", "path": "^0.12.7", "pusher": "^1.5.1" } }
Now run npm install on the directory and then node index.js once the npm installation is complete. You should see App listening on port 4000! message.
Testing the application
Once you have your local node webserver running, you will need to make some changes so your application can talk to the local webserver.
In the info.plist file, make the following changes:
With this change, your application can now talk directly with your local web application.
Conclusion
We have created an application that works as a public chat application on iOS using Swift and Pusher. If you want to, you could expand this application to have a typing indicator feature and a delivery status.
Forget the Hindenburg: What I learned on board a zeppelin
Eden Prairie, Minnesota, is as good a place as any to learn a hard truth.
This suburb of Minneapolis is largely indistinguishable from the other suburbs that border it ... except that Eden Prairie has an airport. Last weekend, that airport played host to an air show, which featured your typical air show goodies—World War II bombers, modern military jets, stunt pilots, etc. But the Eden Prairie Air Expo also had something very special ... the Eureka, one of only three passenger zeppelins operating in the entire world.
Which brings me to the hard truth. The Hindenburg disaster often gets saddled with the blame for ending the era of airships. Plenty of sci-fi stories have started with the premise, "What if the Hindenburg disaster never happened?" and ended up assuming that we'd all be flying around in totally awesome zeppelins instead of boring old airplanes.
Unfortunately, the real circumstances that led to the demise of the airship appear to be a bit more complicated. If there's one thing I learned from getting up close and personal with a zeppelin, it's this: There are some very good reasons why the airplane won the fight for humanity's hearts and ticket fees. Reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the Hindenburg.
This is not to say that the Eureka isn't pretty neat.
Perched in a field near the end of the airport's main runway, it was easily the most noticeable thing at the air show. The Eureka is big. Bigger than a 747. It fills your field of vision in that sort of way that inspires you to turn your steering wheel towards it, even if there are ditches, and buildings, and several airplanes between here and there. That's pretty cool.
It also has some practical functions. Ground crewman David Fritz told me that the Eureka has been used for field research, helping scientists track pods of killer whales off the coast of Seattle. That's a job helicopters can perform as well, but the Eureka does it a little better—it's able to hover over the pods for longer periods of time while using a smaller amount of fuel, and it also has a bigger payload.
Zeppelins like the Eureka also have some big advantages over the common blimp. You're probably aware of the basic difference: Zeppelins have a rigid frame that the "balloon" is stretched around, and blimps don't. But that difference matters. Zeppelins can carry more weight, so their gondolas can be larger. More importantly, they're also quieter to ride in. Because the gondola is the only solid surface on a blimp, the ship's engines and propellers must be mounted directly to that. On the Eureka, the propellers are mounted above the gondola, fixed to the rigid frame. If a blimp is like riding in a motorboat, a zeppelin is like being on a cruise ship. Advantage: Zeppelin.
But what if you compare the zeppelin to an airplane? This is where things go downhill. We don't live in an airship-less world because the Hindenburg turned everybody into fun-haters. We travel via airplane because airplanes have some distinct advantages in cost, speed, and conditions of use.
I'll start with that last one. When I planned this story, I was hoping to be able to tell you about "My Ride in a Zeppelin." Unfortunately, that didn't work out. I was only able to climb into the gondola while the Eureka was parked. Why? The weather.
July 15 was pretty stormy in Minneapolis. It rained on and off throughout the day. There were a couple of brief periods of thunderstorms, and the wind was gusty. It's the wind that turned out to be the most important factor in grounding my zeppelin adventure. "An airship is like a big sail," said Corky Belanger, one of the Eureka's pilots. "We've got a square acre of fabric."
That "sail" means landings, loadings, and takeoffs are tricky on windy days. On a landing, Belanger said, the wind could catch the zeppelin and push it sideways, like a beach ball skittering across the ground. The wind also moves the ship while it's tethered down. The Eureka is 246 feet long. Not coincidentally, that's also the radius of the mooring circle that the ship forms as wind slowly pushes it around on it's little back wheel. All of that meant that the Eureka had to sit on the ground while planes were safely taking off and landing on the runway behind her.
Wind can also make a difference when a zeppelin is in flight. The Eureka has a top speed of 78 mph. But it usually flies a lot slower, crewman Fritz said, closer to 45 mph. Meet a 50 mph headwind, and suddenly your zeppelin is going nowhere fast.
Speed is, I think, a key to understanding why airplanes overtook zeppelins as the favored mode of air travel. "When we go from one airport to another, [the support vehicles] can keep up with the zeppelin on the road," Fritz said.
That's why the Eureka is popular as a tourist attraction, selling sightseeing flights for a few hundred dollars an hour, but unlikely to make inroads in the field of real transportation. Zeppelins are cool and all, but if you really need to get from Point A to Point B, you'll either do it faster in a plane, or do it cheaper in a car.
Finally, there's the issue of expense. I'm not talking about fuel, here. Zeppelins actually use less of that than planes do. Instead, it's the support staff that starts to get unwieldy. When the Eureka travels, Fritz told me, it travels with 13 ground crew members, 4 mechanics, and 4 pilots, plus guest service personnel. Remember, that's for a ship that seats 12. (The crewmen, mechanics and backup pilots travel by car.) A 12-seater airplane, in contrast, really only needs to take a couple of people with it, and have a mechanic or two standing by at the nearest airport.
Some of this could be fixed by infrastructure—if the world were full of zeppelin ports, then the Eureka wouldn't have to travel with it's support staff. But even once you take that into account, the zeppelin needs babied in a way an airplane doesn't.
You've probably seen old photos of zeppelin ground crews holding ropes to help the ships land. Today's ground crews don't have to do that anymore, Fritz told me, because the ships now maneuver with the help of rotating propellers that can change orientation and allow the ship to land like a helicopter. Instead, one of the primary jobs of the modern zeppelin crewman is to hang out on the ship, monitoring the weather and the zeppelin's ballast levels.
There must be somebody on board the Eureka, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even on a rainy, windy day, when nobody was going to take the ship anywhere, David Fritz was sitting in the gondola alone, watching the monitors. The balloon of the ship is filled with helium, but also contains two ballast bags—bladders at the fore and aft that can be filled with air from the outside. While he's on duty, Fritz controls these ballast bags. If the ship needs to be heavier in back, he sets that ballast to take in more air. The ballast bags compress or decompress the helium, making the ship lighter or heavier than air.
"That's actually why there's somebody on watch," he said. "We're managing the pressure. If the rain were to stop and the sun would come out again, it would start to heat up the helium [expanding it] and then the ship gets lighter."
Without the constant eye of Fritz and colleagues, the zeppelin could start to rise up off the ground while still tied down. Airplanes certainly need maintenance, just like everything else. But being able to turn the lights off and walk away is a distinct advantage.
Ultimately, I came away from my visit to a zeppelin with two thoughts. First, it's a nice reminder that the world is pretty complicated, and it got to be the way it is for many reasons. Sure, the Hindenburg contributed to busting the zeppelins' bubble. But improved airplane engineering probably played a bigger role.
Second, impractical or not, zeppelins are still totally awesome.

I'm not sure what to make of this — and I am sure that some readers will put this into the “too good to be true” category, but here's an new angle on the E-Cat from an exchange on the Journal of Nuclear Physics:
Giovanni
April 4, 2016 at 3:07 AM
Dear Andrea,
has your ecat-q ever produced (apart from heat, electricity and light) some kind of THRUST?
Best regards
Giovanni Andrea Rossi
April 4, 2016 at 5:57 AM
Giovanni:
Yes.
Warm Regards,
A.R.
Andrea Rossi is inviting a whole new batch of questions with this statement. When the questioner talks about thrust, I assume he means a reaction-less thrust or propulsion similar to what people are referring to with the Em-Drive, which has been tested by people at NASA and other places. Those who have claimed to measure the effect with the EmDrive have said it is very small, and the thrust mentioned here could be similarly small, and not practical.
Even so, this would of course be an astonishing additional feature of the E-Cat that Rossi has thrown out there now, but we have no data or details to go on right now; I hope we can learn more.
UPDATE:
Andrea Rossi was asked about the the “thrust” issue, and this was his response:

Mark Saker:
we are trying ( TRYING ) to make a propellantless thrust. Maybe we will not succeed.

More than 20,000 .wales and .cymru domain names have been registered since their full launch two years ago.
The 20,670 total represents a modest increase since March 2016, when more than 19,000 domains had been logged.
More than 10,000 were registered within the first month of them being made available to the wider public on St David's Day 2015.
Web body Nominet said the domains had enjoyed a "fantastic" welcome since their release.
Nominet, which administrates the domains, said the combined total for .cymru and .wales is in the top ten European geographical domains, in terms of searches online.
Top 10 in Europe
It said research suggested one in 30 of the domain names included a Welsh surname, with Jones being by far the most popular used in a web address, followed by Evans and Williams, with many registrants choosing a .cymru or .wales for their personal email addresses.
The domains rank alongside other geographic locations such as London, Berlin and Paris, coming in at ninth in the top 10 table.
High-profile business and organisations which have taken up Welsh domains include the Football Association of Wales, the Welsh Government and the Federation of Small Businesses.

The old saw that “bad facts make bad law” is supposed to be operative only when a court is in a position of making law — i.e., deciding a vexing legal question in the absence of firm guidance from a statute or precedent. That is not the situation, however, in the matter of President Trump's temporary ban on entry into the U.S. by refugees and aliens from seven Muslim-majority countries. Federal district judge James Robart of Seattle was not on tabula rasa when he issued a temporary restraining order suspending the ban. He was acting in defiance of the law.
Trump's executive order is patently lawful. In our system, border security is a plenary power of the political branches; the judiciary has almost no authority over it. Moreover, not only is a president at the height of his constitutional power in acting against foreign threats to national security; Congress, which has indisputable authority to prescribe qualifications for aliens seeking to enter the country, has further vested the president with sweeping discretion to impose temporary bans. The controlling provision of federal immigration law, Section 1182(f), could scarcely be clearer:
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.

Trump's executive order explicitly relies on this statute and tracks its language. The statute does not invite judicial second-guessing of his judgment. The claim that the executive order imposes an unconstitutional “Muslim ban” is specious. No matter how foolish such a policy would be, it is anything but clear that the Constitution would prohibit a categorical ban on Muslim aliens — or, indeed, on all aliens. And even so, Trump has not come close to doing such a thing.
The ban applies to refugees and aliens from seven Muslim-majority countries, affecting less than 15 percent of the world's Muslim population. The seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan — were not chosen because they are Islamic. The exclusion is expressly rooted in an Obama-era law, now codified in Section 1187(a) of the immigration law, that permits the federal government to refuse visas to aliens who cannot be realistically vetted for security risks because their native countries are either sponsors of anti-American terrorism (as is the case with Iran) or have been left with dysfunctional or nonfunctional governments because of war.
Even as to the seven cited countries, the ban is only temporary (90 days). Similarly, the refugee ban is anticipated to be temporary (120 days) — although for Syrian refugees there is no definitive limit because U.S. security agencies have conceded that vetting them is extraordinarily difficult. The point is not to keep Muslims out; it is to set up a reliable screening system that will deny visas to persons who threaten national security. Significantly, the order empowers the secretaries of state and homeland security to make exceptions on a case-by-case basis (e.g., for aliens who have helped our armed forces overseas). In addition, it caps refugee admissions at 50,000 for this year, which is comfortably within historical levels — including during several of the Obama years.

Nevertheless, acting at the behest of two states led by Democratic governors, Washington and Minnesota, Judge Robart (an appointee of President George W. Bush's) suspended Trump's order. His ruling is judicial policymaking masquerading as law: The judge believes that the executive order provides more anxiety for aliens and hardship for the administration of state universities than security for the United States. That Robart tacitly realizes that this call is not his to make is evident from his ruling's failure to mention, much less address, the legal authority cited by the president. Nor does Robart explain how he figures the states should prevail on the merits, notwithstanding that this is a prerequisite to the issuance of a temporary restraining order.
This decision should be an easy one to overturn, even for the notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit. Yet, the Trump administration's self-inflicted wounds have helped its opposition muddy the waters. The order, signed on a Friday night, was immediately put into effect, with no time for agencies to prepare or for travelers holding formerly valid visas to change their plans. The result was a weekend of confusion and chaos. The relevant Cabinet officials, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, reportedly had minimal involvement in the policymaking process, even though they are principally responsible for enforcing the president's order and explaining it to the public; apparently, they were embroiled in a dispute with the White House political team over the ban's application to lawful permanent residents (LPRs), who are already subject to extensive vetting and considered the legal equivalent of citizens for most purposes. Kelly was eventually authorized to waive restrictions against LPRs and others with lawful visas, but not before the media characterized the administration's performance as amateur hour driven by anti-Muslim bias.
Judge Robart'​s ruling is judicial policymaking masquerading as law.
When Robart made his ruling, Trump did less than nothing to call attention to its baselessness. He launched a Twitter attack on the “so-called judge” who issued it and on “the court system” — a fit of unpresidential pique that will not go unnoticed by the appellate court. Even though the administration, notwithstanding its objections, immediately complied with Robart's ruling, Trump ensured that the weekend's big story was the president's seeming undermining of judicial legitimacy.
The appellate court should overrule Robart, but it has an out: Generally, temporary restraining orders cannot be appealed; review must await the entry of a permanent injunction. That principle should not control in this case: Robart did not put an end date on his “temporary” injunction, so treating it like one would elevate form over substance. He also took the unusual step of making the suspension nationwide, even though his jurisdiction is generally limited to the greater Seattle area and the case involves just two of the 50 states. Given that the restraining order suspends government policy in an area where there is almost no legitimate judicial role, it cries out for immediate appellate review. But the Ninth Circuit could use the nominally temporary nature of the injunction to sidestep a decision, returning the case to Robart for further, drawn-out proceedings.

Thus far, the Ninth Circuit has refused to grant the administration an immediate stay. It has, however, directed rapid briefing from the parties and could issue a decision in the next few days. The stakes are high. With only eight justices currently on the Supreme Court, and all four liberals hardwired to endorse “progressive” results, the administration must anticipate a 4–4 deadlock there at best. If that were to happen, the Ninth Circuit's decision would stand.
The president's executive order is entirely lawful, and a dutiful judiciary would make that clear. Donald Trump can help the Ninth Circuit come to the right decision by letting his lawyers, rather than his Twitter account, do the arguing.
So here we are once more, right back where British Columbians were in the spring of 2013: with a provincial election in its final days, the New Democrats leading and the incumbent Liberals staring defeat in the face.
Four years ago, poll after poll had the NDP cruising to victory. Those polls turned out to be dead wrong. Instead of an NDP government, Christy Clark's Liberals were returned to office.
This election has so far played like a sequel, with a few fresh plot twists. The NDP led the polls going into the campaign, but in contrast to 2013, that lead appears to be narrowing and may have disappeared.
Story continues below advertisement
Further plot twist: The Green Party, a distant also-ran in past elections, is a factor; if polls are to be believed, it's backed by as many as one in four British Columbians. If it can persuade voters to follow through on those intentions – a big "if" – the third party could end up deciding the election. Possible scenarios include a minority government, with the Greens holding the balance of power.
On Tuesday night, can the Liberals win their fifth general election in a row? A comparison of the parties, their records and their platforms suggests that's what should happen. Ms. Clark's Liberals, though far from perfect, are better than the alternatives. On balance, they deserve to win.
However, before praising the Liberals, allow us to enumerate some of their deficiencies.
The greatest of these is political donations. On Ms. Clark's watch, B.C.'s fundraising Wild West became wilder than ever.
Even as other provinces brought in tough rules curtailing the influence of money in politics – banning dollars from unions and corporations, bringing in hard donation limits, and generally curtailing the ability of favour-seekers to buy the government's attention – B.C. remained an outlier. Cash-for-access was business-as-usual.
Yes, the NDP also took advantage of the province's virtually non-existent rules, fuelling up on union money. But the free-for-all primarily benefited the party in government, the Liberals. Last year, they raised $12.4-million, mostly from corporations, including the sale of high-priced tickets to small, private gatherings with the premier.
That Ms. Clark and her party for so long refused to alter this cozy state of affairs was not just a moral failing. NDP Leader John Horgan has been able to paint his party as representing real people, while characterizing the Liberals as the party of plutocrats. Unlimited donations are the gift that keeps on giving – to the Liberals' opponents.

A few months ago, the Liberals finally conceded. Ms. Clark promises that, if she wins the election, she will create an independent panel to rewrite B.C.'s fundraising rules, in concert with the other parties. Reform is coming late to B.C., but it appears to be finally coming.
On the campaign trail, the Liberals would rather not talk about any of that. They are running on their fiscal and economic record, where they have successes to point to.
The provincial unemployment rate? Canada's lowest. Economic growth? Tops in the country, two years running. The Liberals didn't cause this, but at least they didn't get in the way. A low hurdle, sure, but one many governments can't clear.
The budget? Balanced. Debt? Low and stable. It's at half the level or less of provinces east of Saskatchewan.
The B.C. Liberals can also claim to have brought in the country's most credible and economically efficient climate-change policy: the carbon tax on fuel. The Justin Trudeau government is basically trying to cajole the rest of the country into catching up to B.C. The B.C. carbon tax is also close to revenue-neutral: the money raised is largely returned through other tax cuts. Other jurisdictions (hello, Ontario) treat carbon cash as a government windfall.
One of the drivers of the B.C. economy in recent years has been housing, and despite the obvious signs of speculative overheating in Greater Vancouver and Victoria, the Liberal government long declined to intervene. When it finally did, it made one politically popular mistake. But it also made two sensible moves, while avoiding one big, tempting misstep.

Mistake made: Introducing taxpayer subsidies for first-time home buyers. These may appeal to some voters, but they only pump up the housing market.
Sensible step taken: bringing in a 15-per-cent foreign buyers' tax, and allowing Vancouver to tax empty homes. The first measure has already been watered down, but it's still a move in the right direction.
Misstep avoided: The B.C. Liberals, unlike the government of Ontario, haven't used high housing prices as an excuse for expanding politically appealing, but economically destructive, rent control.
On resource development, the Liberals have tried to walk a sensible middle path. Their dreams of windfalls from the development of a B.C. natural gas export industry have yet to come to fruition – blame global energy prices – but on oil and pipelines, they've tried to strike a balance, favouring new projects but demanding environmental assurances and financial returns.
The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion has become a measure of the contrast between the province's two leading parties. In 2013, the NDP flip-flopped and then promised to kill the project; that may have cost them the election. The Liberals backed the pipeline, with conditions. Four years later, a deal has been negotiated, Ottawa has given its approval and promised significant new money for spill prevention and remediation – and the NDP is still opposed.
No, the B.C. Liberals aren't perfect. But on Tuesday in British Columbia, perfect's not on the ballot.
An Albany home has sold for $2.45 million, setting what agents believe is a new record for the city.
The 2,355-square-foot, two-story California Craftsman at 1613 Sonoma Ave. has four bedrooms, two-and-a-half-bathrooms, bay views, a stone fireplace and a convenient location just two blocks from Solano Avenue with its restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores.
The sale closed March 29 and the listing agents were Barbara Hendrickson and Rudy Gonzales of Red Oak Realty in Berkeley.
“While prices have been soaring, this sale of $2,450,000 shattered all prices in Albany,” said Hendrickson.
“That's absolutely the highest price I've ever heard of in Albany by quite a bit,” said Todd Hodson, co-owner of Marvin Gardens Real Estate, a brokerage that focuses on properties in Berkeley, Albany, Kensington and El Cerrito. Hodson has been in the business for decades.
The next-highest recorded price for a single-family home in Albany over the last year was $1,950,000 for 940 Evelyn Ave., which sold in September 2016, according to East Bay Regional Data, the multiple listing service for the East Bay.
“We get shocked every week as to what homes go for,” Hodson said. Referring to the East Bay in general, he added: “We have seen prices ratchet up.”
The sale illustrates how competitive home sales have become locally. For at least three years, there has been a dearth of homes on the market, both in the East Bay and the Bay Area in general. Buyers find themselves competing fiercely over the few homes available, which drives price up.
“There's so little inventory,” said Hodson.
For example, there were only seven homes for sale in Albany this week.
Part of this, of course, is because the city is so small, with about 19,700 people living in a 5.5-square-mile area, according to the U.S. Census. Nonetheless, it's an example of the scarcity of properties for sale all over, agents said.
“Good houses will stay on the market 14 days or less,” said Tracy Sichterman, a real-estate agent and owner of Berkeley Hills Realty. “It is a common pattern to have two weeks of open houses and then accept multiple offers.”
With regard to 1613 Sonoma, Hendrickson said there were seven offers on the house, two at the sale price. All but two of the offers were over $2 million, Hendrickson said. The home went on the market on March 1, listed at $1,685,000, meaning it sold for 45% over its asking price.
One factor that sets the property apart is its size, said Wayne Cory, a real-estate agent with the Berkeley office of Coldwell Banker.
“This house is a four-bedroom. It's unusual to have a house this large in Albany,” he said. “If you are looking for that size of house, people are willing to pay more for that.”
Hodson concurred: “Anything over 1,500 square feet is rare in Albany. People are willing to pay a premium (for larger homes) because the cost of doing additions has skyrocketed as contractors get more busy.”
Sichterman,who has 20 years' experience in the East Bay market, described Sonoma Avenue as “the most desirable street” in Albany.
“If there is going to be a commanding high price,” it would be on that street, she said.
The house's proximity to Solano Avenue and, in the other direction, Monterey Market is another factor adding to its desirability, Hodson said.
Along those lines, “I call it the million-dollar walk to coffee,” Hendrickson said. People are willing to pay much more to be close to amenities such as coffee shops, she said.
Albany schools are highly sought after, and that is reflected in the prices of the city's homes. Albany High School, for instance, is ranked 119th in the state in the 2016 U.S. News & World Report annual survey, with a 91% graduation rate.
“The schools are the primary driver for Albany,” the home's co-listing agent Gonzales said. “Out of the seven offers on the house, five were interested in the schools.”
However, “the buyers who prevailed loved the house for itself,” as well as the neighborhood, Hendrickson said. The schools were not a factor for them, she said. “They sincerely loved the house, the coastal oak and the location.”
“I attribute this to an extraordinary house that was meticulously maintained by the sellers,” she said. Hendrickson has close ties to the house; she was involved in its sale in 1989 when it was a small, single-story house, and has remained close to the sellers ever since. “The owners added a second story and then remodeled the kitchen in 2006, both times using the expertise of noted architect Glen Jarvis who understood the house and knew what he was doing,” she said.
According to East Bay Regional Data, the price of 1613 Sonoma is the highest sale price for a home in Albany since 1998. Two homes were listed at a higher price, but did not sell for that price. The Alameda County Assessor's Office does not track the highest prices paid for homes.
Donald Trump lost control of his destiny Wednesday with the appointment of a Justice Department special counsel. But the setback for Trump may only be temporary—and if it is temporary, that could be disastrous.
The order creating the new special counsel's office run by Robert Mueller, a serious and determined former FBI director, is much too narrow. It authorizes Mueller only to pursue “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.”
The order was signed by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who Trump got to issue a letter justifying the removal of James Comey as FBI director that Trump himself has admitted was cover for what he planned all along. Rosenstein appears to be a dedicated public servant, but only the latest of many prosecutors Trump has outwitted or compromised.
With apologies to Saturday Night Live, in this political farce Rosenstein has shown himself to be a Not Ready for Prime Time Player.
A much broader investigation is required, one that reaches to all his business activities involving foreign money, especially his involvement with Russians and Russian dirty money back to 1990.
Jim Henry, the investigative economist who has exposed money laundering for four decades and now writes about Trump's Russian money connections for my nonprofit DCReport news service, thinks the order is so narrow it may be intended to sink the inquiry.
“Of all the smoke pouring out of Trump's basement, the dirtiest, darkest smoke comes from his involvement in money laundering and financial fraud, including keeping from his investors when he knew about the organized crime involvements of his close associates,” Henry says.
Henry points to financial deals from Panama to Manhattan to Iceland to Toronto and beyond that all involve criminals and in some cases come perilously close to Vladimir Putin, the kleptocrat in Moscow whom Trump frequently praises as a great leader.
Henry notes that from a Wall Street Journal report, “we learned just this week that Trump's leading partner in the bankrupt Trump Tower in Toronto was able to channel at least $15 million to Trump from a loan that came from a Russian bank whose executive chairman is Vladimir Putin.”
Keep that in mind the next time Trump says “I have nothing to do with Russia.”
Rosenstein has the power to expand Mueller's investigative portfolio and may well do so if asked. The question of the moment is why start out with a constricted inquiry instead of a broad one?
Congressional Republicans especially need to understand the reasons that a much broader inquiry into Trump's conduct is required, because if they decide it is in their interests to go after Trump and he emerges on the other side merely wounded, they will pay dearly.
Trump is a Republican of convenience. Many of his policy proposals, such as they are, defy modern GOP orthodoxy. And he has denounced Republican leaders such as Speaker Paul Ryan when he thought it was in his interest to do so, affirming that with Trump loyalty is a one-way street.
To be blunt: Unless Rosenstein's order is broadened it may come back to haunt the nation and even put the continuation of our democracy in jeopardy.
Those are strong words, but walk with me through Trump's conduct, history and strong and growing dictatorial tendencies to see why we should all be concerned, but especially Congressional Republicans, some of whom have begun to go public with what has been their private panic over the Trump presidency.
Trump has already signaled his supporters to not regard the constitutional process now underway as legitimate. “This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!” Trump tweeted Thursday morning.
The tweet followed the message he sent Wednesday to the Trump faithful, who already believe he is being undermined by our other constitutional officers and the mainstream press, groups Trump has encouraged his followers to distrust or even hate.
Read Trump's words at the Coast Guard academy graduation ceremony in a speech full of self-praise and lacking focus on the future of these officers that is the norm for graduation addresses. “Look at the way I have been treated lately, especially by the media. No politician in history,” he said, “has been treated worse or more unfairly.”
This comes after well more than a year of Trump signaling that he has little to no intention of submitting to any democratic decision he dislikes and denouncing as “bad judges” the jurists who found his executive orders fatally flawed.
During the primaries, Trump alone would not raise his right hand in a pledge to support whomever GOP voters picked as the party's standard bearer . Later he said that he might not accept the November election results if Hillary Clinton won.
And then there is his ludicrous insistence that he drew the biggest inaugural crowd in history, the kind of fake official announcements that make us laugh or shudder when made by tin horn dictators or the likes of murderous power mongers such as Putin.
These dictatorial tendencies were demonstrated again and reinforced this week when he invited the near-dictator of Turkey to the White House. Earlier Trump was the only leader of a major democracy to call President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan with praise after he narrowly won an election that moves Ankara away from more than a century of democratic secular government and toward dictatorship.
Then there is what happened after a Wednesday White House visit gave Erdoğan a Trump stamp of approval.
According to District of Columbia police, Erdoğan's security people launched an unprovoked attack on American protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence, even pushing away cops who tried to stop the violence. The attack by a foreign power's agents on American soil against Americans drew a standard rebuke from the State Department but not one word from Trump, even though he constantly says he is busy protecting Americans from foreign violence.
Should the limited inquiry Mueller was authorized to pursue end with Trump remaining in office I expect it will bring his dictatorial tendencies more forcibly to the fore. If the inquiry ends with his removal from office, there is no prospect that Trump will behave like Richard Nixon, who showed his respect for our Constitution when he resigned in August 1974 after it became clear he had lost all support on Capitol Hill.
Nixon spent the rest of his life trying to rehabilitate his image, understandably defending his actions in Watergate, but not challenging the system of checks and balances through which he was removed and never challenging the legitimacy of our federal government.
Don't expect that from Trump. If ousted, we can expect this petulant, immature narcissist to go on the relentless attack, a policy he advocates often including in his books The Art of the Deal and Think Big.
Remember, as a candidate Trump urged violence against some protesters at his campaign rallies. Why would he behave with less promotion of violence if forced from office or apply less violence if he remains in office?
Since the late 1960s I have reported on people and organizations, left and right, who describe the United States of America as a criminal organization, an oppressive and illegitimate power. They are a small minority for sure, but they are a minority that could be whipped into a frenzy the way Trump whipped supporters at his rallies into frenzied calls to lock up Hillary Clinton.
We need a no-holds-barred investigation. And that is not what Rod Rosenstein authorized.

Long ago, the Tea Party was somewhat mysterious to the American public. In a quaint statistic, a full 26 percent of Americans in January 2010 responded to a CNN poll saying that they had "never heard of" the movement. Times have changed.
CNN's opinion research outfit has just released a new poll indicating that not only has everyone heard about the Tea Party (all but 7 percent responded that they had), but the movement has garnered its highest ever unfavorable ratings by the American public. In a March 11-13 sampling, 47 percent of respondents expressed that they didn't care much for what they've heard about Tea Partiers, compared with unfavorable ratings ranging from 26 percent to 43 percent the previous year.
Interestingly, as The New York Times' Nate Silver explains, the Americans who are now fed up with the Tea Party aren't disillusioned former supporters. It's those who have always had "ambivalent views" about the movement who have now soured on the Tea Party. In other words, the political middle has been slowly but steadily turning away from the movement even while core supporters (Silver positions them in the "low 30" percent range) haven't abandoned ship.
So while the poll can be read as the movement is "running out of steam," as Politico concluded, it appears that the Tea Party isn't losing political support as much as gaining more opponents who never were on board in the first place. That would be the optimistic reading, at least.

Get the Recipe Deep Fried Pizza
There hasn't really been a lack of coverage on fried pizza here on Slice. The first I heard of it was probably about the same time that most of you heard about it as well: when Adam first wrote about the Montanara at Forcella in July of last year. And that's with good reason. At that point, Forcella was the first and only place in New York (perhaps in the country?) serving fried pizzas of this particular style, and according to owner Giulio Adriani, modeled after only a handful of restaurants in Naples that served them.
For the record, what we're talking about here is an entirely different beast than the battered and deep fried regular pizza slices that have been popping up at state fairs and fry-everything bars in Scotland—ever since that fateful night when a fry cook and a stoner got drunk together. (Or perhaps the two were one and the same).
The fried pizza we're talking about is made much in a Neapolitan style—that is, dough topped with a simple sauce of pureed tomatoes, salt, a bit of fresh mozzarella (smoked mozzarella in the case of the Montanara), olive oil, and basil, all cooked in a hot, wood-burning stone oven. The key difference? Before any of this happens, the stretched-out disk of dough is deep fried until crisp.
Since being introduced to this style, we've taken you on a behind the scenes tour of how the Montanara (as the fried pizza is called) is made, we've seen the opening of La Montanara—an all-fried pizzeria on Ludlow street—named after the signature pie, and we've even been taken on a tour through its history, courtesy of Scott. Fried pizzas have indeed come a long way.
But there was one part of Scott's post that really intrigued me: while many people find deep frying to be a technique relegated to the professionals with restaurant kitchens, in Naples, the traditional fried pizza is quite a different beast—a creature of the home kitchen created in order to quickly cook a pizza without the benefit of a blazing hot wood-burning oven.
Home pizza technique, eh? Sounds intriguing!
While Scott briefly explained the method back then, I figured it was worth a deeper look. I'm glad I did, because I can tell you that these were some of the finest pies to ever come out of my home kitchen, and believe it or not, it's remarkably simple to do.
No Smoking
I'll get to the frying method in a moment, but first I'd like to discuss an issue that has deeply troubled me for most of my life: Most smoked mozzarella stinks. It's either made with the dry, aged stuff so that comes out more similar to a smoked gouda than a mozzarella, or it loses so much of its fresh, soft, milky texture that it comes off as something more suitable to playing a round of handball with (Alleva dairy, I'm looking at you!).
It wasn't until I tried the imported smoked mozzarella in the Montanara, that I realized that you could have a cheese that combined a sweet, balanced, subtle smokiness, along with the creamy, moist melting qualities of a great mozzarella. The problem is that I have no clue where to get good imported smoked mozzarella in New York, which leaves one solution: do it myself.
My first attempt was to actually smoke the mozzarella using my standard wok-smoking technique—you line a wok with foil, put wood chips (or whatever) on the bottom with the food on a rack above it. Heat it up on a stovetop, then when it starts smoking, seal the foil trapping the smoke inside. The cheese definitely got smoky, but it also got far too hot, losing its soft, tender texture, and squeezing out all of its whey.
I've also had good luck cold-smoking cheeses in the past using a smoking gun—a hand-held cold food smoker. Unfortunately, they cost around $100.
The final solution I ended up with is one that's liable to get me banned from barbecue websites and competitions around the country, but it's one that I stand behind 100%: just use liquid smoke.
I know, I know. It's unnatural, acrid, and all that stuff. And some brands are. But not all of them. A few brands, like Wright's, are 100% natural, made by smoking real wood chips in a moist environment, running the moist smoke through a condenser, then collecting the concentrated liquid that drips out the other side. It's precisely the same stuff that ends up penetrating your meat when you smoke it in a real wood smoker. Indeed, when I worked at Cook's Illustrated a few years ago, I made some for myself just to prove it.
Point is: used sparingly and applied in the right way, liquid smoke works.
Having just explored ways in which to improve poor mozzarella a couple weeks back, I knew that you could soak mozzarella in a warm, salty bath of milk to help it get softer and creamier. So I figured, why not just add a few drops of liquid smoke to the mix as well?
The method worked. Before adding the mozzarella to the smokey milk bath, I ripped it into rough chunks to increase its surface area to absorb more smoke flavor. What I ended up with was a nice, subtly smokey cheese with all the moist, creamy, melting qualities of a 100% fresh mozzarella.*
*In fact, at Don Antonio, the cheese they use on their pizza is stretched in milk, not in water, to add creaminess. Cool!
Time to Fry
Having read through Scott's experiments and having seen the pizza men fry their pies at Don Antonio, I had a pretty good grasp of the basics. But there were still a few things to tweak.
To start with, I began with my basic no-knead pizza dough, the dough which I use for most of my pizza projects these days. It's a moist, supple, slightly difficult to work with dough, but produces excellent, bubbly, puffy crusts. There's a direct relation between the amount of water you put into a dough and how much the dough will puff when it bakes, but with too much water, you run the risk of making a dough that's impossible to handle.
This particular dough is hydrated at 75% (that is, the water in the dough weighs 75% as much as the flour), a very high water content that puts this dough at just about the limit of what I can handle in a normal cooking environment. I quickly discovered that what works in the oven becomes dangerous in a wok full* of oil. Imagine trying to gingerly lower a slippery conger eel slowly into a pool without getting any water on you, except instead of water, the pool is filled with 350°F oil.
You end up getting burned. (Or at least, I do).
*yes, the wok is the best vessel for deep frying at home)
I found that lowering my water content all the way down to 62.5% made for a much more manageable dough that could still stretch quite easily. I was afraid that with less water, it wouldn't puff up dramatically enough as it cooked—I like my pizza with big, airy pockets—but it worked out just fine. See, that puff—which bakers call "oven spring"—is caused by air and water vapor rapidly expanding inside a stretchy network of interconnected flour proteins. The faster you can transfer energy to the dough, the faster it'll inflate, and the better your oven spring.
That's why pizzas baked in a 900°F Neapolitan wood-burning oven end up so nice and poofy, while your home-baked crusts may only rise a little bit.
Well, turns out that oil is such a terrific transferrer of energy that even at 375° and a lower hydration, your crust ends up getting just as much oven spring (or should I say "fryer spring"?) as it would in a very hot oven with a wetter dough.
Poofiness was not an issue. What was an issue was this:
Oops. Looks like I didn't learn the first lesson of fried dough—you must make ventilation holes. Without them air and water vapor collect under the center of the crust, which bubbles up into a dome. Press down on that dome to try and release the gas, and it comes out—FAST. It basically bubbles up and out through the hot oil like a geyser, causing it to fly up and over the edge of the wok and reminding you exactly why restaurant kitchens have a "no open-toed shoes" policy in place.
Want to save your feet? Do a bit of this:
And once it goes in the oil, hold it in place with a large wire-mesh strainer (a couple of slotted spoons would work just fine.
The key to this stage is that you want to cook the pizza just long enough to puff and being to develop some crispness. You don't want to fry it 100% of the way or it'll end up drying out in its subsequent visit to the oven. About a minute and a half total is what I did. I tried both flipping the dough and simply holding it down with the strainer and didn't find that either one produced a noticeably better crust. Flipping was definitely easier though, so that's what I'll do from now on.
Once it comes out of the fryer, it goes into a metal pan (I used a pre-heated cast iron skillet), gets topped with tomato sauce, smoked mozz, and basil, then finished off in a hot oven to melt the toppings and char the crust slightly. You'd think that the hoels in the crust would lead to drip through, but I made over a dozen pies when testing this and not a single one had that problem.
I used my go-to broiler method for the final oven visit.
Note to those of you who've made pizza under the broiler before: a fried pizza crust burns MUCH faster than a regular pizza does.
Now that looks like a pizza that was fried by Dom DeMarco himself.
Cutting down the cooking time delivered this beaut:
[ASIDE:] And it was then that I had an insight about one of the big problems I have with homemade pizza—the cheese always browns or burns before the crust is properly browned. My theory is that with good neapolitan pizza, the outer rim of the crust bubbles up above the level of the cheese, and thus cooks faster. Homemade Neapolitan pies don't show quite as much oven spring, so the crust ends up not much higher than the cheese, and thus doesn't brown as fast.
It's just a theory, but one working into. [/ASIDE]
You want fryer spring? You want fryer spring? I'll get you your fryer spring.
How's that? And notice, if you will, the micro-bubbling on the crust. It's shockingly, beautifully crispy. Enough so that one of my tasters during round 1 of testing asked me if there was corn meal in the crust.
And I'm sure you're all wondering, "but isn't it greasy?" The answer is no. Not in the slightest. Sure, it doesn't taste exactly like a regular oven-fired pizza, in that it's crisper and puffier, but the grease itself has very little impact on the flavor, and you're certainly not left with oil running down your arms or anything like that. Besides, pizza ain't health food.
This is a plain homemade sausage and tomato pie I made for a friend with a dairy allergy. The sausage fat soaks into the crust quite nicely without a cheese barrier protecting it. I may have to try this again.
To tell you the truth, I'm pretty enamored with this technique. Indeed, it may well be the crispest, puffiest, best-textured pizza ever to come out of my home kitchen, and it all came with very little work.
As it so happens, I have been working on a number of recipes for the breakfast chapter of my book (homemade breakfast sausage, foolproof no-whisk no-double-boiler hollandaise, and perfect poached eggs), so I figured what the heck and made a breakfast pie with sausage, egg, parm, and a drizzle of hollandaise to finish it off.

Thanks to J.J. Abrams, Star Trek is back and now, possibly, bigger than ever. Regardless of whether you love or hate the new films, their success in generating new enthusiasm for the world of "where no one has gone before" is undeniable.
That's why now is the time to bring back Star Trek to TV, where, many fans would argue, the series belongs. Sure, some of its concepts make for a great movie, but Star Trek began on television and that's where it's mostly thrived.
However, if Star Trek returns to TV, it needs respect: modern TV audiences are different from those that watched shows like the original Star Trek or Star Trek: The Next Generation. And that was most evident when the most recent attempt to bring Trek back to TV, Star Trek: Enterprise, only managed four seasons and a mediocre interest with science fiction fans.
There is, now, a renewed interest in science fiction on TV, particularly with space-based adventure series: the success that Syfy recently had with several of its new shows, Killjoys and Dark Matter, attest to that. So now is the time to strike while the iron is hot: by bringing the show that started it all back to the airwaves.
So how can Star Trek become a TV series again? Here's how it could work:
Keep It As Its Own Separate Series
A new Star Trek series should not follow in the movies' footsteps and become a reboot. We need a new entity with new characters, stories and a new ship (although a version of the Enterprise). In fact, a new series should keep even casual mentions of other Trek-related characters and stories to a minimum and focus on its own setting and characters. It should become something that someone who's never seen a Star Trek show or movie could get into.
Aliens shouldn't always be humanoid
One of the things that modern fans of Star Trek have an issue with is that all the aliens seem as human as humans themselves. A new Star Trek series should feature aliens that look, well, more alien, including species of aliens never before seen in the Star Trek universe. Now that we have better CGI technology, as well as makeup special effects, creating alien-looking aliens shouldn't be an issue.
Base The Series In The Future
Perhaps one of the problems with Enterprise is that showed Star Trek's history, rather than its future. Thanks to previous Star Trek shows, we already know what happened in the past, and even with new stories, it's not as interesting as seeing things happening in a future we're unaware of. That's why The Next Generation did so well, so a new series needs to go even further than that: the next next generation, perhaps. Let's see what the future after Captain Picard looks like.
Use Real Science Fiction Writers
Sorry, J.J. Abrams, but you're not really a science fiction writer: your strength lies mostly with fantasy adventure. And that's why the films lack a lot of the "science" in the science fiction of Star Trek. A Star Trek series needs writers that not only understand the "science" part of science fiction, but have the imaginations that the original series had, which featured input from sci-fi heavy hitters like Robert Block and Harlan Ellison. Good science advisers on hand is also not a bad idea: use them.
Cast Unknowns
The joy of watching Star Trek: The Next Generation was discovering the great actors that we came to know and love: let's face it, none of us really knew who Patrick Stewart was until he donned that uniform. The problem with Enterprise was that a well-known sci-fi actor, Scott Bakula, was put at the helm of the ship: many couldn't get past the fact that they knew him as Sam from Quantum Leap. With an unknown cast, it's easier to understand new characters in the Trek universe.
More Androids
Remember how iconic Data became in Star Trek: The Next Generation? Well, it's likely that androids will become even more a part of society, as well as more integrated in the Federation, in the future. Let's see them becoming who they are and deal with some issues, such as the singularity and machines becoming conscious. There are some great ethical issues that the series can deal with here, and let's face it: those kinds of issues were always handled well with both the original series and The Next Generation.
Bring Back The Morality Plays
The beauty of Star Trek is that there were always questions of morality raised. Does one violate the prime directive and save an entire civilization? Or does one let that civilization die to preserve the prime directive? How does one deal with alien civilizations with belief systems that seem primitive, or even wrong, to our own? This is something Star Trek always handled well and something Enterprise (and the J.J. Abrams films) often forgot. But some of the best Star Trek stories comes from plots dealing with morality.
Focus On Space Exploration
Star Trek originally focused on going "where no one has gone before." The J.J. Abrams films have all but forgotten space exploration as part of Trek, and that's a shame: because "discovering new life on new planets" is part of why the Enterprise set off in the first place. Even Voyager did this to an extent, and although Deep Space Nine wasn't as focused on exploration, it was still a part of its setting as a space station. A new series must focus on exploration and giving viewers something new to look forward to, and to discover, every week.
Give Us Hope
It's become a trend for science fiction to become very dark and make the future seem like this horrible and desolate place: something we would never want to happen. But Star Trek is about hope and the future being a bright shining vision of something else, something more. A new TV series should focus on this aspect of the series and give viewers characters to cheer for and a positive future. That's not to say that there shouldn't be any kind of darkness to the series, but at the end of the darkness, there should always be light. That's what Gene Roddenberry would have wanted.

SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster has raised the possibility of a deferral on today's vote on the future of the Rangers newco.
The chairmen of the 12 SPL clubs meet at Hampden Park to discuss the new company's application to join the league following Charles Green's recent buy-out.
Motherwell became the eighth club to publicly declare their intention to vote against the proposal on Tuesday leaving Charles Green's newco facing demotion to the Scottish Football League.
But Doncaster told Sky Sports News it was no certainty the issue would be decided on Wednesday with the new season just three weeks away.
Important
"It's important that clubs don't close off any options while a First Division second-tier option remains in play," he said. "It may be thought that the best thing to do is to defer.
"That will be a judgement for the clubs today. They've got the best interests of their club to think about and the best interests of the game as a whole.
"The option a lot of people have talked about with Rangers at the bottom of the pyramid in division three would ultimately wreak huge financial damage on the whole of the game in Scotland.
"It's difficult to see why 41 innocent clubs should pay the price for the misdemeanours of one."
Steam, Valve's PC gaming haven, was unavailable to users Friday morning after the site fell victim to a reported distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. Two Twitter users claimed responsibility for Steam's service outages, saying they used a botnet to overwhelm Steam's servers with traffic.
The outage comes on the last day of Steam's holiday sale that began on December 19 and ends at 1 PM Eastern/ 10 AM Pacific Friday. For the final hours of the sale, Steam was offering the most popular deals from the 15 day holiday sale.
Steam was definitely struggling to stay online Friday morning. At this writing (11 AM Eastern) the Steam support and community sites were unavailable via a Web browser or the Steam desktop client. (Editor's note: As of noon E.T., Steam appears to be working fine.)
No Steam for you! (Click to enlarge.)
As usual when online outages happen, Steam fans took to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to vent their frustrations over the service outage. Some hoped Steam would extend the sale as a result of the outage, while others were growing frustrated that they couldn't access Steam services.
Not the first time
But whether Friday's outages were actually the work of hackers or Steam's own IT support has yet to be determined. Despite the hackers' claims, Friday wasn't the first time Steam struggled to stay up this holiday season.
Valve set off a flood of Steam traffic on Christmas Day when it offered Left 4 Dead 2, the popular zombie shooter from 2009, as a free download. Steam's servers struggled to handle the load from so many people grabbing the freebie at the same time and many users reported the site was inaccessible to them for brief periods that day.
But the service woes didn't begin and end with Steam: EA's Origin platform, Blizzard's Battle.net, and the servers for both League of Legends and Dota 2 also battled DDoS-related outages in recent days, though those attacks were claimed by another hacking group.
Firefighters protesting M&I (SMWIA 565)
It's becoming increasingly obvious that the Republican rescission of bargaining rights in Wisconsin was a pyhrric victory for the plutocrats, as it has energized not only labor activists, but folks from all across the political spectrum who are beginning to see the true colors of the Republican Party. As E.D. Kain wrote in Forbes yesterday (yeah, Forbes):
Governors like Scott Walker, Rick Scott, and Jan Brewer are riding on the coattails of the Tea Party, but they've become blind to the dangers of their radical policies. In Wisconsin, Democrats are already promising to step-up recall efforts. But the recalls are only a small part of what is likely going to be a huge anti-Republican backlash across the nation, as working Americans finally realize what that party actually stands for: an playing field heavily tilted toward the rich and powerful, toward corporate power, and against worker rights.
And the backlash won't just be electoral. In the Nation, Mike Elk reports on a grassroots movement to pull deposits from M&I Bank, one of Scott Walker's largest contributors:
The blowback from Wisconsin governor Scott Walker's union-busting crusade has only just begun—and it may soon hit the governor where it really hurts: in the deep pockets of his biggest donors. Workers have begun organizing a “Move Your Money Campaign” against M&I Bank, whose employees are among his chief financial backers . . . International Association of firefighters Local 311 President Joe Conway, Jr., told me two union members marched in and pulled a combined $192,000 dollars out of the bank. “Hopefully this sends a message to the bank,” says Conway. “We wanted to illustrate how serious our threat is by having just two of our members pull their money out.“ A senior union researcher estimates that unions have at least $1 billion invested in M&I Bank, mostly through pension funds. Discussions are going on at the highest levels of the labor movement about how exactly to leverage this financial clout in the political debate in Wisconsin. Since the Bank of Montreal is in process of purchasing M&I Bank, US unions have reached out to the Canadian Labour Congress to urge their involvement in a disinvestment campaign.
And now there's a site dedicated to the M&I Bank protest movement.
Walker, Kasich, Daniels and their ilk began to overreach and abuse their perceived "mandates" as soon as they could -- now, the consequences of overreaching are rebounding just as quickly, as it's clear that Americans are fed up with the attacks on the middle class.
Overview (5)
Mini Bio (1)
With a decades-long career as an actor and stuntman, Verne Troyer was best known for playing "Mini-Me," Dr. Evil's smaller and more concentrated pure evil protégé, in the hit comedies Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and for his role in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). Troyer, born in Sturgis, Michigan, had always dreamed of getting into showbiz. Shortly after his high school graduation in 1987, he moved with some friends to Arlington, Texas, where, in 1993, he got his first break as a stunt double for a 9-month-old baby on the film Baby's Day Out (1994). In his early years of film and television work, he often portrayed animals or small children.

Personal Quotes (31)
Between takes I asked Vern how tall he is and he said "I'm 32 inches tall but if you ask me how tall I am I'll tell you 'I'm two foot eight!' because it sounds bigger." (said with a wry grin in the mid-1990s)
We were doing the dance routine and I dislocated my knee. I've been doing stunts for a long time and it's kind of weird that I'd dislocate my knee just dancing.
I can play the leading man. I can play the action hero, maybe in just a different way. I look at it as, you know, if you set your mind to it, you can do it.
I love London. I would move here. I like British people; everybody is so down to earth.
I stay away from the elf roles; I stay away from playing a leprechaun. All the roles I try to do are something that an average actor would do.
I was working at a candy-wrapping factory before I became an actor. I admit I snuck some hard candy, which is great because you can suck on it while you're working.
In Men in Black, it was a very small character, no pun intended.
Doing stunt work is risky, but it's something I enjoy.
There's nobody else that can double me - except for a doll.
I'm a big sports fan. College football is my favorite.
The Amish like to live a very plain lifestyle, the way they think God intended. It sort of brings you back to, like, 'Little House on the Prairie' days or something.
In the film, I'm not very mobile, like in the space suit.
Me being able to beat up Austin Powers? I mean, how great can that be?
It's hard for me to even watch comedies I'm in.
Now I get to pick and choose exactly what I want to do.
L.A. is so fake - girls there are so superficial.
I grew up in Michigan, in a very small town, Centreville. In my graduating class, I had like 92 people.
I've done approximately 15 films, and most of the things I've done have either been stunt or costume work.
I still pinch myself that I ended up in Hollywood. And I am still surprised at the fans.
I felt probably more uncomfortable than Beyonce. But I can't answer for her.
I just take it one day at a time. Austin Powers has given me a lot of opportunities as far as my career.
I'll be one of the Who's of Whoville.
I think it was a good challenge for me to get my reactions across without being able to speak.
I was just the perfect person to play the Mini-Me character.
In high school and college all my friends and my brother wrestled.
I went to see the film with a regular audience for the first time on Sunday, and was basically swamped.
What I really enjoy the most is seeing what the crowd likes. I enjoy making people laugh.
There are times when you're having dinner with a good friend and you're in the middle of a conversation and somebody comes up and cuts you off. Can you sign this? Can I take a picture with you? I'm adjusting to all the attention.
If I did everything, I probably wouldn't be here talking to you. There aren't too many people who can actually double me, so I do most of my stunts though.
I think when average-size people start taking roles that were meant for dwarfs, that's a little frustrating because there aren't that many roles out there for height-challenged actors.
People have a good time with all the catch phrases.

Why Is NumPy Only Now Getting Funded?
Recently we announced that NumPy, a foundational package for scientific computing with Python, had received its first-ever grant funding since the start of the project in 2006. Community interest in this announcement was massive, raising our website traffic by over 2600%. The predominant reaction was one of surprise—how could it be that NumPy, of all projects, had never before secured funding?
Sometimes this surprise was expressed as skepticism, or a critique pointing out that funding of a kind had gone to NumPy prior to this grant. Wes McKinney, for example, pointed out on Twitter that Numeric and Numarray (pre-NumPy projects) were supported through NASA funding at Space Telescope Science Institute, development time was put into NumPy by paid developers at Enthought, and (mostly now former) academics like Travis Oliphant spent time developing NumPy in lieu of writing academic research papers.
Why should open source software development require “huge sacrifices?”
But why have “huge sacrifices” been necessary to produce and maintain these projects? And why are sustainable funding and resources so difficult to come by?
The answers to these questions touch upon a host of challenges related to open source software development in general: burnout, overwork generated by the tragedy of the commons, and the mistaken notion that critical open source work can be sustainably produced on an all-volunteer basis.
NumFOCUS has identified three primary challenges to sustainability for open source projects in scientific computing:
1) Lack of funding mechanisms to support the ongoing maintenance and improvement of existing software
2) institutional barriers to the development of software as a research endeavor, and
3) the hindrance to academic career advancement for those who develop and support research software.
NumFOCUS recently contributed a submission in response to the NSF Dear Colleague Letter: Request for Information on Future Needs for Advanced Cyberinfrastructure to Support Science and Engineering Research (NSF CI 2030) that outlines these three challenges in depth. Over the next few weeks, we'll be posting a blog series exploring these challenges in more detail.
The Looming Crisis in Scientific Computing
The problem of sustainability for open source scientific software projects is significant. Arguably, it affects the whole of contemporary scientific inquiry, insofar as that inquiry requires software tools that promote reproducible results (i.e. open source).
In August of 2011, Fernando Perez, founder of IPython/Jupyter, gave a keynote at Euro SciPy explaining that the entire scientific Python stack was essentially relying upon on the “free time” work of only about 30 people—and no one had funding! The key slides from Fernando's talk:
NumFOCUS was founded in 2012 as a response to this looming sustainability crisis.
NumFOCUS is designed to provide a home for open source scientific software projects that offers independence, stability, logistical support, and access to monetary resources.
Many of the sustainability challenges Fernando highlighted in 2011 have yet to be fully addressed, but we are hard at work tackling them. This year, NumFOCUS launched our Sustainability Program, headed up by Projects Director, Christie Koehler, and supported by our Sustainability Advisory Board. The initiatives Christie is developing are designed to help secure a sustainable future for key projects in the open source scientific computing community. Keep an eye on our blog for more posts exploring sustainability in open source scientific computing. And if you'd like to take action to contribute to project sustainability, consider becoming a NumFOCUS member today.
'Mum and dad' investors myth busted
24 May 2013
‘Mum and dad' investors myth busted
Green Party research, confirmed by Treasury, shows that half of the shares in Mighty River Power that National sold to retail investors went to just 13,000 people and that 10 percent of the retail shares went to just 400 wealthy people and organisations, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.
The sale of Mighty River Power saw 113,000 retail investors, referred to as ‘mum and dad' investors by the National Government, buy 26.9 percent of the company. Analysis by the Greens and Treasury shows that half of those shares were, in fact, purchased by fewer than 13,000 people who bought an average of nearly $35,000 worth of shares. That included a select group of fewer than 400 individuals, trusts, and organisations who bought 10 percent of the retail shares with an average investment of nearly quarter of a million dollars each. The remaining 101,000 retail investors bought only 13.4 percent of the company – less than the amount taken by overseas institutions.
“National's myth that it sold Mighty River Power to ordinary New Zealanders has been well and truly busted. John Key's ‘mums and dad investors' line was a con,” said Dr Norman.
“The truth is that 98 percent of New Zealanders bought no shares at all. Half the retail shares went to just 0.3 percent of the population, and a tiny group of just 400 wealthy individuals and organisations got 10 percent of the retail shares.
“National's asset sales have been a failure in its own terms. The hundreds of thousands of eager buyers that Mr Key promised didn't show up, so he sold the shares to a small number of wealthy people instead. The shares are not widely held; they are overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few.
“National is governing in the interests of the handful of wealthy people who bought large hunks of Mighty River Power, not the vast bulk of Kiwis who don't want to pay again for what they already own.
“Far more New Zealanders have signed the petition for a referendum on asset sales than bought into Mighty River Power. National should cancel the remaining the asset sales,” said Dr Norman.

Updated 3:38pm: A law expert believes the parents of the St Bede's rowing pair weren't prepared for the public backlash that followed their intervention in the school's attempt to discipline them.
The parents have dropped legal action against the college, after they won a High Court injunction to keep the boys at the Maadi Cup regatta.
A statement from the lawyer for the St Bede's College board of trustees said a substantive claim will not be pursued by the parents of Jack Bell and Jordan Kennedy.
The Board of Trustees has also agreed not to seek costs from the families.
University of Canterbury Law professor Ursula Cheer says the court action received a lot of scrutiny, which no one was prepared for.
Lawyer for the school's board Garth Gallaway of Chapman Tripp said it was not disputed by the students of the parents that the boys breached security by riding a baggage carousel into a secure area.
"The school has been very clear with me as legal counsel that a resolution to the legal proceedings was important as the reaction and intense public scrutiny was in all likelihood not anticipated by the families and the families remain part of the St Bede's community," Mr Gallaway said.
The board has also, at the request of legal counsel for the parents, agreed not to seek costs.
Board chairman Warren Johnstone says this was all given serious consideration before an agreement was reached late yesterday.
"In terms of costs, the board made this decision as this matter should not be about money but rather about what behaviour is expected and what the consequences need to be when situations such as these arise.
"What happened at Auckland Airport is extremely serious and is about the safety and security of everyone who passes through an airport.
"There are some other behaviour matters that have arisen either directly or indirectly as a result of this overall situation that are being taken very seriously and will also now to be considered and addressed.
"This may take some time to ensure everyone is heard and that the management practices of the school relating to behaviour are able to continue as parents expect."
Mr Johnstone said the public was not aware of many factors the board has had to weigh up and the situation had been extremely challenging and complex.
The school has put in place reintegration plans for the students, who returned to school on Monday, and support plans for any students or staff who may need it.
The statement said extra relief staff were also in place this week to ensure that St Bede's staff had time to provide support and guidance to students who may need this and to their colleagues.
The board and school rector were also working together to look at how they ensure there is not a repeat of this situation.
The row was sparked after the two boys were caught riding on the baggage conveyor at the Jetstar carousel in the arrivals hall at Auckland Airport's domestic terminal.
The pair were given formal warnings by police and the Aviation Security Service after the prank shortly after arriving on a domestic flight from Christchurch.
On November 11, Turkish authorities detained Olivier Bertrand, a journalist for the Paris-based Les Jours news portal, who was working in the Turkish southern city of Gaziantep near the Turkish-Syrian border. After three days in detention, he was able to return to Paris. In an interview with Sputnik France, the journalist commented on his arrest.
Bertrand noted that he took all necessary precautions while working in Turkey, but still was arrested by the local authorities under pretext of not having a special work permit.
"I think that this story with a permit is only a pretext. Although since April 2015, indeed, [journalists] theoretically need a work permit in some Turkish cities, including Gaziantep, all media do without it. Usually, journalists are free to come to Gaziantep. It is located far from the Syrian border, about 75 kilometers away from it, and almost all work in Gaziantep without permission, which I did myself six months earlier," the journalist told Sputnik France.

The arrest of the French journalist — who visited Gaziantep to make a report about a local school once again shows that freedom of the press in Turkey is in danger.
More than 140 Turkish journalists are currently in prison. Many of them, including the employees of Turkish opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper, were arrested because Turkish authorities suspected them of having links with supporters of the Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara believes to be behind the July coup attempt.
"I have never written articles to protect Gulen. I am doing my job as a journalist, a carefully-worded, unbiased and honest job. This summer, after the putsch and after the Turkish government had accused supporters of Gulen of organizing the coup, my job as a journalist was, first of all, to try to explain who Fethullah Gulen actually is, because nobody knows about him here [in France]," Bertrand said.
Turkey has repeatedly drawn criticism for the crackdown on opposition parties, media and academics. Its discriminative policy towards journalists has been criticized by Brussels and various rights groups.
According to the reporter, the Turkish government has difficulties to understand that "a journalist is supposed talk to all parties when he wants to do his job impartially."
"Today in Turkey, you are viewed as an accomplice when you discuss or cite someone who is an associate or close to the associates of Gülen, or someone close to a Kurdish organization," the journalist said.

In Bertrand's opinion, "there are practically no more viable opposition newspapers" in Turkey. All media are "under the governmental control," the journalist explained.
However, he still believes that journalists can do a lot to promote the media freedom in the country.
"There is still one important thing, the Internet. The regime often cuts off the Internet and access to social networks, but I think that today websites are the only possible and easiest way to create a flexible information product without significant investments," the journalist concluded.
On July 15, an attempted coup took place in Turkey and was suppressed the following day. Over 240 people were killed during the coup attempt and an estimated 2,000 were wounded. Ankara has accused Gulen and his movement, outlawed in Turkey, of playing a key role in the coup. Gulen has denied the accusations.
VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Good morning from Father Bauer Rink, home of the University of British Columbia. Both teams are practicing here today and tomorrow because Rogers Arena is hosting events the next two days: Supertramp tonight, Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae tomorrow. I have no idea who those latter two are.
Alex Burrows will not be suspended for biting Patrice Bergeron in Game 1. Vancouver's first-line agitator appeared to give Patrice Bergeron's right index finger a chomp at the end of last night's first period.
“After reviewing the incident, including speaking with the on-ice officials, I can find no conclusive evidence that Alex Burrows intentionally bit the finger of Patrice Bergeron,” Mike Murphy, senior VP of hockey operations, said in a statement.

Bergeron reiterated that Burrows bit him. But Bergeron said he respected the league's decision.
“I've over it,” Bergeron said. “I'm moving forward for next game. We've got to get back in the series. It's the league's decision. I'll let them make the call, make the decision. It's theirs.”
The tip of Bergeron's right index finger is red. Bergeron said it was bleeding last night.
“We're not the type of team that whines and cries about things like that,” Claude Julien said. “We just move on. That's what we're going to do.”

Man is gifted with a very high level of consciousness. It gives us the power of communication. It helps in keeping a specific purpose in mind. We can decide when to communicate. We can choose whom to communicate with. We also can choose the medium of communication. Also check how much to communicate.
We can test the effectiveness of a communication very easily. Check whether the desired outcome is met or not . The acid test is whether the communication is as per the need of the situation or not.
Communicate to Live
not Live to Communicate
Our subconscious mind at times makes us to speak. It also compels us to think without any purpose. In such a case, what we speak, write to the other person, think about others may lead to some unwanted situations. Communication by itself should not become a need. It is our distinct ability. We use it to carry out a task together, we use it to relate with someone.
Tips for effective Communication
Have clarity about what we need in various situations. Try to develop power to think creatively. Also try to control your negative thoughts and feelings. Have faith in other people that they will change themselves. This really helps to foster effective communication. Have clarity about your higher order goals. Link those with the present communication s.

Hans Christian Andersen, creator of "The Little Mermaid," was inspired by his love for a series of women but died a virgin, according to his latest biographer.
"I believe he never had a sexual relationship," said Bente Kjoel-bye, whose book "H.C. Andersen and His Lady Friends" was published Monday."If he had had, we would know about it from his fairy stories which all reflect his personality," she told Reuters.
Kjoelbye explores in detail the private life of the Danish writer, whose stories such as "The Ugly Duckling," "The Little Matchgirl" and "The Elves and the Shoemaker" are still read by millions of children.
Andersen always had a circle of adoring women who shielded him from public indifference and ridicule, the book says.
As well as his passion for actress Jenny Lind, the "Swedish songbird" who later became the mistress of an English crown prince, Andersen's four other unrequited loves are recorded.
Seven other women, from childhood friends to substitutes for the mother he lost at the age of 14, were his confidantes, including Dorothea Melchior, who was present when he died in 1875 at the age of 70.
"The women he loved were his inspiration as a poet. The others were his substitutes for a family," Kjoelbye said.
"He didn't want to lose his personality by sinning. He may have been frightened off the physical side of love when his mother remarried," she added.
When Russia won the rights to host the 2018 Football World Cup, a tweet on my timeline wondered which Great Russian Novel to read as preparation. India may not be able to embarrass Fifa into getting hosting rights for 2026, but the question should still be answered: which Great Indian Novels (GINs) should people read to prep for an encounter with our country, or to feel warm and fuzzy and well-read in India?
Uh-oh. Wrong question. After all, is there any number of GINs whose names we can reel off to the curious? Is there even one, actually, that we can all agree on? Yes, I hear murmurs about Salman Rushdie, but shouldn't the writer of a GIN at least be an Indian resident for us to claim that the I-for-Indian part is genuine? Let's admit it, we cannot unanimously—or even consensually—identify any one, leave alone ten, work that will qualify.
On the other hand, ask those who read Malayalam, or Bengali, or Tamil, or… (you get the picture) and there will be no lack of candidates, at least, for the G Malayalam N, or the G Bengali N, and so on. But I-for-Indian? How can we even get enough people from across the country to agree unless they can all read the novels in question? Obviously, they can do that only if the novels are first translated. Into English. Which, I admit, is at least the language of semi-colonisation; but it's too late to complain about that, folks.
Enter, accompanied by trumpet blasts, the translator. No, wait. If English has to be the medium of consumption, followed by acceptance or rejection, why not just look within the realm of English language fiction in India, which, after all, has been anointed by His Salmanness with this incantation: ‘The prose writing—both fiction and non-fiction—created in this period by Indian writers working in English, is proving to be a stronger and more important body of work than most of what has been produced in the 16 ‘official languages' of India, the so-called ‘vernacular languages', during the same time; and, indeed, this new, and still burgeoning, Indo-Anglian literature represents perhaps the most valuable contribution India has yet made to the world of books.'
Actually, Rushdie is right—inasmuch as those who have never heard Bhimsen Joshi proclaim Manna Dey the best classical Indian singer. Dey is very good, of course, at what he does, but, but, but… And if Rushdie has not read enough of the novels written in any of those 16 languages he alludes to, that's largely because he doesn't know the languages. Those who have read a Pather Panchali or a Mathilukal or a Kafan—in any language—know that English fiction alone cannot claim to speak for all of India.
The empirical evidence apart, any candidate for a GIN would also have to have been written by an author who has lived her life in the language of the novel. There may be exceptions, but it is hard to imagine India's War and Peace being written in a language that is not the one its characters and author actually use every moment of the day. English as a medium of existence—combining conscious thought, subconscious impulse and unconscious instinct, the very fabric of one's creativity—has probably not existed long enough in India to produce the GIN.
So, get out of the way, you actors and actresses, and let the translator make her entrance. For she—and she alone—can give you the GIN.
Or can she? Isn't there an inherent contradiction in claiming that while a novel written in English cannot (yet) lay claim to the mantle of the GIN, a translation into English can strut its stuff? After all, when a novel is read in English, the reader is also making a jump from his real existence—he, too, has probably not lived his life in the English language. How valuable, then, is his assessment of the novel, and how credible is a consensus that says that such-and-such novel, written in Gujarati (or Kannada or Oriya) is a worthy claimant to the GIN tray? As Arab writer Mohammad Rabie puts it, ‘(Translation)… can certainly misrepresent a culture, or it can give rise to a deformed cultural understanding and actually obstruct rather than enhance hybridity and intercultural awareness.'
The truth, however, is simpler than this analysis might suggest. The G-for Great in the IN will shine brightly through any fog—real or intellectually imagined—cast by the process of translation into English, the borrowed language that has now burrowed into our lives. But only a translation can take the beacon out of the regional cave in the first place into the plains of the country and the world.
Of course, there is that other contentious question. Can there at all be an Indian novel, given the divergences in regional cultures and sensibilities? Translated into English, would novels in Assamese, Marathi and Punjabi actually have anything in common that marks them as Indian, other than a currently shared administrative geography? Wouldn't making a claim of a common identity between such works be no different from suggesting that the literatures of Spain and of Slovenia are both mysteriously ‘European' because the countries have a common currency today?
Is the GIN only an imaginary assertion of an imaginary homeland? Should we just look for the GBN, the GTN, the GMN, the GHN and so on…? (In which case, no translation is required for that particular purpose.)
This argument may have been true 50 years ago, when regional labels were strong enough to identify what set a Tamil apart from a Punjabi. But it isn't valid today, for culture, work, entertainment and consumption behaviour across the geography of India are converging on an approximation of something that can be identified, if not sharply defined just yet, as Indian. Not Malayali, not Kannadiga, not Bihari, but just Indian, under a common economic, administrative and market-friendly environment. And under this umbrella, regional literature—no matter when it was written—is still Indian literature for today's reader. And only the translator can ensure that the reader discovers it.
Ironic aside: It is the translator—and not the Indian writer in English—who can ultimately make English an Indian language. For, if a wealth of writing in India's original languages is translated into English, the language will have gained the Indianness of those texts, in the process being woven into the reader's faculties as a means for transmitting India.
Envy, if you like, the translator her mission. The Indian writer can write only for a limited audience—it is the translator who brings him out of the room on the roof into the front lawns where readers come and go without requiring linguistic visas. It is only the translator who—wince if you must—can bring tonic to the GIN.
NATIONAL POLITICS & POLICY | Health Insurers Offer To End Practice of Charging Women Higher Premiums for Individual Policies
[May 6, 2009] Health insurers would be willing to end the practice of charging women higher premiums than men for individual insurance policies if the government agrees not to establish a public insurance plan, America's Health Insurance Plans President Karen Ignagni said Tuesday, the New York Times reports (Pear, New York Times, 5/6). Ignagni made the proposal at a Senate Finance Committee hearing that focused on ways to cover uninsured U.S. residents as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's health care system. President Obama and congressional Democrats support the creation of a government-run insurance program that would compete with private insurance plans.
This is concerning for several reasons. First I was not aware of the practice of charging women more - and this can be from 25% to 50% more.
But I find this a somewhat cynical attempt to peel off constituencies supporting the public option by offering to make concessions conditional on dropping the public option. Other offers so far include stopping the practice of refusing policies to the sick. (They haven't actually offered to pay for needed treatment.)

Two films this month are garnering a sudden rush of attention: Cake and Still Alice. Both are pretty naked instances of Oscarbait (though Cake missed the boat on that one, Still Alice managed an Oscar nod) via the ongoing problem of cripface and the tragedization of disability.
Julianne Moore and Jennifer Aniston have never publicly identified as disabled, let alone with early-onset Alzheimer's or chronic pain, yet they were cast in disabled roles, in tearjerker films that send a particularly disturbing message about disability to audiences.
While no one is required to oblige their disability status, the issue becomes more complicated when people who appear nondisabled—or at least do not appear to share disabilities with the people they portray—are cast as disabled characters.
Our handling of disability in media and pop culture is already bizarrely twisted and distressing, and cripface adds to that, creating a completely artificial notion of what disability is like in the eyes of nondisabled viewers, readers, and listeners. Both Cake and Still Alice fall out along familiar lines, repeating troubled narratives about disability and reinforcing the idea that disabled actors aren't available—or aren't talented enough—to anchor Oscar vehicles.
You don't win an Oscar for being a disabled actor playing a disabled character. You win an Academy Award for being a nondisabled actor digging deep to play a disabled character, like Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot, and you get attention for your suffering in roles like Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Hawking in Hawking, which ran on the BBC in 2004 (a role reprised by similarly nondisabled Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything).
Nondisabled actors taking on disabled roles get critical acclaim and attention while their talented disabled counterparts, for the most part, are ignored—actors like Marlee Matlin are the exception, not the rule, and as a member of the d/Deaf community, her relationship with disability is complicated. Not all d/Deaf people identify as disabled, for personal, political, and cultural reasons, viewing themselves as members of a shared culture.
Cake didn't get the critical acclaim its creators might have hoped for. Critics routinely slammed it for being rote and predictable, a classic sign that the film was hoping to carry itself with the disability factor. The film documents the life of a woman with chronic pain who's addicted to painkillers—something that might well put your hackles up if you live with chronic pain. And with good reason.
There are a lot of problems with how disability is handled in Cake. The character portrayed by Aniston is white (because in depictions of disability, only white people are disabled), and she comes from a privileged world. Her disability wrecked her life, but it was pretty solid before, and thanks to her relatively comfortable social position, she's not being confronted with the thought of losing her home or being unable to afford medical care.
We don't see an authentic representation of the day-to-day realities of living with chronic pain in a purely logistical sense, no matter how many awards the role may win.
You don't win an Oscar for being a disabled actor playing a disabled character.
But about the painkiller addiction thing.
Chronic pain is horribly treated in the U.S., and it's more likely to affect women than men. This is not a coincidence, and the two things are closely linked. As a medical issue, chronic pain is extremely complicated, and patients struggle to find pain control that works for them—all while being treated as drug seekers, ordered to ration their medications, and accused of lying about their pain.
The best way to control chronic pain is to provide patients with the medications they need so they can take those medications. To break down stigma so that patients take their medications before they experience bursts of pain—because once the onset of pain occurs, patients have to wait 20 minutes or more for medication to be effective. Poorly controlled pain isn't just unpleasant. It causes long-term health problems, makes it difficult to work, and induces serious quality of life issues. Many patients are ashamed of taking the medications they need and consequently they experience needless pain and stress.
The concept of being “addicted” to painkillers is often floated when talking about chronic pain, but they are necessary and important medications patients need to survive. Patients who need insulin for diabetes management aren't “addicted” to insulin, because they may be dependent on it for survival. Patients who take immunosuppressant drugs to prevent transplant rejection aren't “addicted,” because they need those meds to stay alive. In fact, many medications are critical for staying alive and functional, but we don't talk about them in terms of dependency and addiction.
Chronic pain patients are placed in a different class, with the expectation that they live with pain rather than treat their health conditions appropriately. Yes, they can form a dependence on their medications and would experience complications if they withdrew their medications abruptly. Yes, medications can become less effective over time as tolerance builds up. And yes, sometimes addiction and complicated relationships with meds can develop—which is why we need a stigma-free environment for patients to discuss concerns with doctors and explore additional treatment to address these issues if necessary.
But needing medication to survive isn't a sign of addiction, and Cake posits that, treating Claire like a pill popping drug seeker. In a role that leaves people verklempt and saying that they're deeply moved. While real people with real chronic pain are out there being treated as drug addicts and liars.
Still Alice, meanwhile, takes us into the life of yet another white privileged woman, this time as a professor experiencing early-onset Alzheimer's. Julianne Moore has been acclaimed in the role, though critics have also spoken to the somewhat formulaic and soap opera-laden approach to the subject. But that's not the point.
Playing disability is the point. Viewing and presenting disability through the nondisabled lens is the point. The goal isn't an authentic depiction of an incredibly rare disease, but to showcase an actor's skills. Finding an actor with early-onset Alzheimer's could have posed a challenge, for a number of obvious reasons, but if people wanted to make a film on the subject, they could have sought out actors with other memory and neurological impairments and focused on authenticity rather than Oscarbait.
Every time I see cripface—and there are always examples, as every year there are a handful of films and television shows with one-dimensional disabled characters trotted out for the sole purpose of showing everyone how talented an actor is and illustrating how deep the producers/writers are—I cringe. I cringe because I hate the way it represents disability, and I cringe because it makes disability into something people put on, like a coat. And I cringe to think of the disabled people working in film and television who almost never get cast in disabled roles, who aren't even included in casting calls.
The goal isn't an authentic depiction of an incredibly rare disease, but to showcase an actor's skills.
It's incredibly rare to see actors in nonnormative bodies playing those roles, with a handful of exceptions. We see Peter Dinklage in Game of Thrones, but, notably, little people don't necessarily identify as disabled and I wouldn't assign that identity to him unless he explicitly talked about himself that way. Likewise with Marlee Matlin and Shoshannah Stern, two d/Deaf actors who've appeared in a variety of works (who again have a more complex relationship to the disability community). R.J. Mitte on Breaking Bad had cerebral palsy, like Walter White Jr., standing out as a rare exception in the disability landscape. Oddly enough, reality shows are where you're most likely to see disabled people being disabled, doing their own thing—like the women of Push Girls on Sundance, or Christine Ha on Masterchef.
The arguments most commonly mustered in defense of cripface are: “We couldn't find anyone to play the role” and “It would be too difficult for a disabled actor on set.” The first is absolutely bogus—there are oodles of disabled actors in Hollywood running the spectrum from incredibly talented dramatic stars to funny-as-heck comedians, and if casting calls were inclusive, producers/casting directors might be surprised. Furthermore, routinely casting disabled people opens up the field even more, by encouraging more disabled actors to move to Hollywood and New York for film and television production.
But what about dealing with disability on set? This is positioned as the real barrier—it's big and scary and unknowable, and who knows if a wheelchair might explode or an actress with fibromyalgia might have a bad pain day and need to take a day off from filming. It's the same attitude that pushes disabled people out of other aspects of public life: It's too hard to accommodate, so let's just exclude.
Yes, working with disabled actors can present specific accommodation needs. For example, sets need to be ramped for an actress who uses a wheelchair. A d/Deaf or hard of hearing actor may need an interpreter. An actress with chronic fatigue or chronic pain may need shorter takes and time off in her trailer to rest. But, guess what: We accommodate other people who have specific needs on set—like, say, children, who are subject to extremely tight rules. We don't cast adults in child roles and say, “Oh well, it was too hard to find a kid.”
We even have children in leading roles, who are somehow magically accommodated even though their working hours are shortened and they're required to take time off from school. We accommodate actors who get pregnant during TV production and need some discreet wardrobe rearrangement/time off for labor and delivery. We accommodate actors who need sudden time off to attend to family crises, as well as actors who need to treat emergent medical conditions like cancers. We even manage to deal with actors who have to travel to promote other projects during filming.
We can accommodate disabled actors: We just choose not to. The problem here isn't the disability, but attitudes about disability.
The repeated use of cripface in film and television treats disability as something less than an identity and more something that can be easily taken on and off, reflective of the medical approach to disability in the United States. It reduces disability to something like a cut or a broken arm, something that can be put on with a bit of makeup. Paradoxically, disabled actors aren't considered for nondisabled roles—if disability is something that can be so casually put on and off and has nothing to do with identity, why shouldn't a wheelchair user play a nondisabled role? Why shouldn't James Bond be blind? Why must Lady Mary walk without crutches? Disability's no big deal, right?
The problem here isn't the disability, but attitudes about disability.
Oh, but it is, as long as nondisabled people are in cripface, apparently.
It exceptionalizes disability, using it as an acting vehicle and awards bait, while at the same time treating it with appalling casualness, like something that isn't a crucial part of individual identity and experience. At the same time, disabled people aren't considered for roles of any kind, effectively cutting disabled talent out of film and television—they can't play themselves in roles where disability is integral to the presentation of a character, and they can't play perfectly ordinary people who happen to be disabled. In Hollywood, they're invisible.
All disabled people are not alike. I've spoken with people who've gotten things out of Cake and Still Alice and other works using cripface, and their views and commentary on the films are important. There's no one right or wrong way to view these films and others in the genre. But the overarching trend is a problem that, while repeatedly criticized by the disability community, isn't going away. In fact, it's feeding itself, as actors and producers see such roles getting attention and decide to create their own versions.
It's time for a full stop on cripface roles, paired with a commitment to viewing disabled talent equally in open casting calls; ability-blind casting for non-specialized roles should be well established by now.

A search is on for a killer after a man was fatally shot during a carjacking attempt in Paramount.It all started when the suspect, who was driving a red Lexus, was involved in a road-rage incident near Artesia Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue in Long Beach on Sunday.During this incident, authorities said the suspect discharged several gunshots into the air. No injuries were reported in this incident.Then, the suspect drove to an apartment complex in the 8600 block of Somerset Boulevard, where he attempted to carjack a man. During this incident, the attempted carjacking victim was shot and killed.The suspect, still in the red Lexus, then fled the apartment complex and carjacked a red Mustang at gunpoint near Garfield Avenue and Alondra Boulevard. The victims in the Mustang were not injured.Detectives said the suspect fled again, this time to Compton. That's where he crashed into a Cadillac near Greenleaf Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard. The driver of the Cadillac suffered minor injuries in the collision.Upon investigation, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies learned that suspect was picked up by an unknown individual or individuals in a black Kia.That Kia was located parked in front of a home in the 1300 block of Sloan Avenue in Compton, where several individuals were initially detained.Sheriff's officials later said those detained individuals do not appear to be responsible for the Paramount homicide.However, deputies said the Los Angeles Police Department detained another person who they say may possibly be tied to the killing.If you have any relevant information about this case, you're urged to contact the LASD's Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. You can also submit anonymous tips by calling Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (8477).
“I am sure he was the Gadol Hador in Ahavat Yisrael”.
“He loved me like a father”.
“The entire Yahadut of my family is only thanks to him”.
These quotes are only a sampling of hundreds and hundreds of similar expressions of love and respect that the Flatbush Syrian community had for its late departed Rabbi and mentor of half a century, Rabbi Shimon Cohen zichrono livracha.
As we reach the end of the shivah period for our dear Rabbi, it behooves us to take the time and reflect on the enormous contribution that he made, and the critical role that he played in the spiritual rennaissance of the community, and in the lives of his students. In sheer numbers it has been estimated that he had taught over five thousand students at Magen David Yeshivah. Of those, and aside from those, many thousands had also attended his Shabbat minyan at Cong. Bet Torah. The incredible chas hivut hatorah that he imparted in his amazing sweet and encouraging way, influenced the overwhelming majority of these students to go on to live lives of Torah-true Jews. The peripheral effect that this had on the many families of these students is staggering, and boggles the mind as to the sheer numbers of lives the Rabbi impacted in his time with us. One woman at the Shivah exclaimed, “My husband learned by him. My son learned by him, and I was looking forward for my grandson to learn by him.” A statement which holds true for many families.
Rav Yisrael Salanter once explained that goal of a yeshivah is to build the self esteem of the students. Rabbi Cohen was the paragon of this virtue, as he went to endless lengths to connect to the essence of each child, bringing out their unique talents. Future teachers would come to observe his classes in order to discover the secret to his success. One fascinating story was shared at the Arayat by a former student-turne d-assistant-Rabbi in Rabbi Cohens minyan at Beit Torah.
He described the beginning of Rabbi Cohens career, which began by substituting for a particularly difficult class in Magen David. This boy was actually the “leader” of the troublemakers in that group, and resolved to make sure that the new sub would quickly move on. However after two weeks with Rabbi Cohen, the boys begrudgingly realized that they were enjoying his class and participating in the activities. In fact, the mother of this leader boy hired Rabbi Cohen to learn with him after class, after seeing the impact he had made on her sons class. At first this seemed like too much to handle. Rabbi Cohen as a Rebbi. Rabbi Cohen as a tutor. But after a somewhat bumpy start, Rabbi Cohen came up with the suggestion that for every ten minutes of tutoring, he would have to watch the boy play basketball for five minutes. And this is what they did. However this arrangement lasted for a grand total of three days . After that the boy mentioned that he feels that he can do twenty minute stretches as well. Then thirty, then forty, until eventually he did the entire hour in one go.
This same boy would periodically come pray in the youth minyan at Bet Torah, and he would spend sometime outside talking. One Shabbat he noticed Rabbi Cohen coming his way, and braced himself for the encounter. “Rabbi”, he said, “what do you want from me? I am comimg , “Oh no!” said Rabbi Cohen, “I want you to become my assistant. I need you to get the guys to come and pray”. Who ? me?
“And”, the student continued, “for the next thiry years I was Rabbi Cohens assistant and I loved him with all my heart.”
Rabbi Eli Mansour, a former student of Rabbi, described how Rabbi Cohen would have them read pesukim from the Torah, as he would stand behind them massaging their backs in encouragement to build their self confidence. If they felt unconfortable, he would whisper in their ear “continue you are doing great”. This memory stayed with the boys for their entire life. It is no wonder that every student felt that he was Rabbi Cohens the closest friend.
Many times he would tell the family to begin the Seudat Shabbat without him on Shabbat morning, since inevitably He would stop to greet every person along the way with his signature smile, and caring words. He would attend and stand under the Chuppah virtually at every wedding at the request of the couple, as each talmid was precious to him as his own child. His sense of self expanded to include all students no matter how different. In the words of his brother, Harav Gavriel Shlit”a, a dayan in Los Angeles, Rabbi Cohen viewed everyone as tcheilet, a beautiful color likened to the ocean blue. Although an ocean contains mud and stones underneath, nevertheless when viewed from afar, one only sees the beautiful blue waves, so too Rabbi Cohen only saw the good in people, a ta lent he honed to perfection.
The family itself was uniquely impacted by Rabbi and Mrs Batsheva Cohen's generosity, when -although newly married- they took on themselves to support all his siblings who had arrived on these shores. In what has become a family legend, they recall Rabbi Cohen's efforts to bring them over. Being a newcomer himself, he had no way to pay for passage for his siblings to come from Morrocco. Someone suggested he approach the Satmar Rebbe, Rabbeinu Yoel Teitelbaum z”l. A shy young man by nature, and knowing the Rebbe only spoke Yiddish, young Shimon Cohen tried communicating in Hebrew. The Gabbai immediately censured him for adressing the Satmar Rav in “Ivrit” [a zionistic language in the opinion of the Rebbe], upon which the Rebbe himself interjected that in fact this was “Lashon Kodesh”, as spoken by the Sefardim in their home country, as opposed to “Ivrit”, an adapted language.
After explaining his desire to bri ng his siblings over, and offer them a Torah education, the Rebbe opened his drawer and used both hands to remove a huge pile of money and place it on the table. The Rebbe inquired if it was enough, and young Shimon Cohen, who had never seen so much money in his life, concurred that it definitely seemed sufficient. This eventually helped bring the family over, and provide for their needs as they began a new life on this continent.
After such an amazing life, one can begin to comprehend the moving story shared at the levaya, a story of incredible sensitivity to the feelings of others, even a small child. One Sukkot Rabbi Cohen noticed a young boy holding an etrog and crying bitterly. Upon asking why he was crying, the boy explained that his pitom had broken off, something which can invalidate the etrog. Rabbi Cohen told him not to cry and promised him to bring him a kosher etrog the following day. The boy insisted and asked if it was possible to get it that night, to which Rabbi Cohen sensitively replied that he would try to bring him one that same night, something he set out to do. As Rabbi Cohen walked to the house of the boy he felt strong pains in his heart, and was forced to constantly sit down along the way, until he reached the boys home. Later that night Rabbi Cohen succesfully underwent triple bypass surgery on his heart. After learning of its success he shared his conviction that it was only in the merit of the kindness he did with the young boy. The Etrog symbolizes the heart, and therefore Hakadosh Baruch Hu granted him a succesful surgery on the heart.
As Rabbi Cohen lay in the nursing facility for the last two years of his life, hundreds of relatives, students and friends came to visit and to pray. Notebooks were kept at his bedside in which countless letters were penned. These emotion laden entries contain the yearning of the many students seeking their Rebbi again. Of the many children who seek their fathe r again.
May Hakadosh Baruch Hu grant us in His great mercy, that Rabbi Shimon Cohen, our great Rabbi, teacher, father and friend, be returned to us one day soon in Tehiyat Hametim, along with the many generations of tzadikim among whom he has been laid to rest, and whose great work he has been instrumental in perpetuating.
Yehi Zichro Baruch.
Written by his brother Rabbi G Cohen and his nephew Rabbi Eliezer Cohen

BEIRUT, December 27 (Sputnik) — Residents in Syria 's eastern regions have created a popular resistance group to battle Islamic State militants, the Lebanese-based Al Mayadeen TV channel reported Saturday.
According to Al Mayadeen, representatives of the newly established group have declared their readiness to fight alongside the Syrian army to curb the Islamic State in eastern parts of the country.
A military airfield in Syria's eastern Deir ez-Zor has in recent months served as the main eastern base of the Syrian Army after IS militants captured the military base in the neighboring Ar-Raqqah governorate.

In August, the Islamic State executed some 700 members of the Sunni Al-Shaitat tribe in Deir ez-Zor after the tribe refused to swear allegiance to the extremist group and recognize their self-proclaimed caliphate.
The Islamic State, known for its brutal tactics, has seized vast territories in Syria, as well as neighboring Iraq, and declared an Islamic caliphate on the territories under its control.
A US-led coalition has been launching airstrikes against the militants' positions in Iraq since August, expanding the attacks to include targets in Syria in September without coordinating their actions with Syrian authorities. Islamic State militants are also being confronted by Kurdish fighters on the ground.
"I know the difference between someone who behaved like a high schooler and someone who targeted high schoolers," the 'Real Time' host said on Friday's season finale, which welcomed Chelsea Handler as a guest.
Real Time host Bill Maher and guest Chelsea Handler on Friday dissected the allegations leveled against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore and Democratic Sen. Al Franken, both of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct, on the season finale of the HBO talk show.
On Thursday, TV host and sports broadcaster Leeann Tweeden came forward and claimed Franken kissed and groped her without her consent in 2006. News of the incident, which Franken has since acknowledged and apologized for, came just days after Moore was accused of sexual harassment and assault by multiple women who allege he pursued them when they were minors.
Defending Franken's "one incident" against the numerous claims made by Moore's nine accusers, Maher made a point to clearly differentiate the allegations facing the two politicians.
"He did a bad thing, and the condemnation has been universal, which he deserves," the host said of Franken, before adding, "What he doesn't deserve is to be lumped in with Roy Moore or Kevin Spacey or Harvey Weinstein or Donald Trump."
Maher called for another #MeToo movement focused on the ability to "tell two unlike things apart."
"I know the difference between a man who once acted like a dick and a man who is a dick. Me too," he said. Taking direct aim at Moore, Maher continued, "I know the difference between someone who behaved like a high schooler and someone who targeted high schoolers. Me too."
Handler echoed Maher's sentiments, emphasizing the need to make a distinction between men who take "accountability and responsibility for an act," and those who accuse their accusers and threaten to sue.
Thought she admitted Franken "did wrong," Handler noted, "He's not a predator, anyone who knows him knows that's not true."
Maher said of the widespread public criticism of Franken, "He's not the zodiac killer. It's not the same thing."
Handler credited the recent flood of women coming forward with allegations of harassment and assault to the aftermath of President Donald Trump's election victory.
Referencing the infamous Access Hollywood tape that didn't put a dent in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, she said that many women are belatedly reacting to their decision to vote for Trump, despite being aware of his inappropriate behavior toward women.
"I think women are sick and tired of being sick and tired," Handler said. "They're like, 'Oh, my God, look what we did.'"
Real Time With Bill Maher will return Jan. 19.
ROME (AFP) .- Lavishly frescoed rooms in the houses of the Roman Emperor Augustus and his wife Livia are opening for the first time to the public Thursday, after years of painstaking restoration.
The houses on Rome's Palatine hill where the emperor lived with his family are re-opening after a 2.5 million euro ($3.22 million) restoration to mark the 2,000 anniversary of Augustus's death -- with previously off-limit chambers on show for the first time.
From garlands of flowers on Pompeian red backgrounds to majestic temples and scenes of rural bliss, the rooms are adorned with vividly coloured frescoes, many in an exceptional condition.
Restorers said their task had been a complex one, with bad weather during excavation threating the prized relics of a golden era in the Eternal City.
"We had to tackle a host of problems which were all connected, from underground grottos to sewers -- and I'm talking about a sewer system stretching over 35 hectares (86 acres)," Mariarosaria Barbera, Rome's archaeological superintendent, told AFP.
To protect the site, tourists will have to book to join one of three daily groups of up to 20 people who will be taken around by a guide for a 15-minute visit.
Cinzia Conti, head restorer, said the plan was to allow people to enjoy "a more intimate, more attentive exploration of Augustus's spaces."
It will also mean "we restorers can keep an eye on and evaluate the consequences of the public walking through, for example the dust on their shoes and especially their breath," she said.
Augustus's decision to build his "domus" near a grotto where Romans worshipped Romulus -- one of the twins who legend has it founded Rome -- was no coincidence.
A man of power
The complex was intended to symbolise not only his power but that of his wife and advisor Livia, who is said to have wielded great influence over him and went on to play an important role in Roman politics after his death.
"Looking at the houses, the buildings he had built, we understand he was a man of power, of great strength, who knew what went into making a political man at the head of such a big empire," Conti said.
The frescoes in Livia's house in particular are one of the most important examples of the period's style, according to Barbera.
The founder of the Roman Empire was born Caius Octavius in 63 BC on the Palatine hill. The great-nephew of Julius Caesar, he was adopted as his son shortly before the latter was assassinated.
Caius Octavius went on to rule over Rome for 40 years, during which the Republic experienced an era of great wealth and relative peace.
Livia, the love of his life, was his third wife, whom he married when she was pregnant with her first husband's child. He adopted the baby, Tiberius, who would succeed him after his death.
Augustus died aged 75, after which the Senate raised him to the status of a god and appointed Livia his chief priestess.
As part of the 2,000 year celebrations, the Palatine Museum has dedicated a room to Augustus with objects connected to his life on show.

With one tweet last night, Nike sent the sneaker-shaped corner of the Internet into a tizzy.
The implication, of course, was that the self-lacing sneakers Nike had created for Back to the Future 2 would finally be a reality. And what better time to do it then on BTTF Day itself?
This isn't the first time for the Nike Air Mag. In 2011, the company released 1,510 pairs of a sneaker based on the futuristic BTTF 2 prototype—no power laces, but otherwise pretty similar. Quite a few extra pairs went to athletes and "influencers," but the core of the run was to raise money for the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which funds research into Parkinson's Disease.
In February 2014, Nike designer Tinker Hatfield—who designed the movie's original shoe, and is responsible for many of the Air Jordan's most enduring models—claimed that self-lacing Mags would be coming in 2015. In July 2014, the Patent Office granted Nike's 2010 patent request for the self-lacing mechanism, and Hatfield re-confirmed a 2015 release date at an event this past February, leaving only the question of when.
Then the Nike tweet from last night. And this morning, this from Marty McFly himself.
The letter reads:
Hey Michael, Almost thirty years ago we embarked on a journey to create a glimpse into "the future." Although the project started as science fiction, we're now proud to turn that fiction into fact. As the first, most celebrated wearer of the Nike Air Mag we wanted you to be the first to receive a living pair. "I meant Nike Mag" (I must have "Air" on the brain)! What is so special about the Nike Air Mag is it's [sic] impact continues to resonate. We may never know it's [sic] final legacy, but we continue to work on projects that carry and progress some of its principles. As you well know innovation never stops at Nike so we're excited about what lies ahead for this idea. We know if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything. In addition to your personal pair, we're creating more pairs for support in aid of the Michael J. Fox Foundation in 2016. We hope that the combined effort will raise even more than the $9.4 million collected in 2011 and contribute in some way to eliminating Parkinson's Disease in our lifetime! Your friend,
Tinker P.S [sic] If my calculations are correct...your pair should be with you shortly.
And just minutes ago, the Twitter account of the Michael J. Fox Foundation posted this.
So. Yeah. They're here. At least one pair, with more slated to come in the spring. We're still waiting on video confirmation of the lacing, but if you want some, you'd better start saving those (tens of thousands of) pennies now.
What is xAPI?
Over the past three years, xAPI has emerged as the hot new standard for delivering online training. xAPI is often described as the next evolution of SCORM. While the SCORM standard isn't going anywhere soon, xAPI has redefined some of the fundamental practices of tracking learning experiences. But what is xAPI? And why do so many experts believe it will soon become the default standard for eLearning content?
What is xAPI?
The SCORM specification was introduced by ADL in 1999. SCORM quickly became the standard around which a whole industry of authoring tools, learning management systems, and content development was built. But as eLearning continued to evolve, SCORM struggled to reinvent itself in order to keep up. While SCORM 1.2 is still the most popular authoring standard used in eLearning, its weaknesses triggered the development of xAPI.
Rustici Software believe that “learning happens everywhere”. That belief inspired Rustici's research on how the SCORM specification could be adapted to suit the next generation of eLearning. xAPI is the result of that work. Rustici chose the name project name “Tin Can” to describe the two-way conversations the technology would track as it made it easier for learning systems to communicate with each other.
The major difference between xAPI and SCORM content is the type of learning each can track. While SCORM is limited to recording online learning, xAPI can track almost any activity. As a result, xAPI delivers a far more detailed view of learner progress, within and beyond traditional learning environments, both online and offline. The kinds of learning it can track are almost infinite, including: reading a webpage, attending an event, borrowing a library book, playing a game, blended learning, and team-based learning.
How xAPI works
Information from xAPI compliant systems is passed in the form of statements. xAPI simplifies how learning is recorded by offering multiple ways to track these statements. Each statement is composed of three elements, a structure known as xAPI syntax:
Noun (Actor - or the ‘who' part of an action)
Verb (The action)
Object (The ‘what' part of an action)
For example:
“I - did - this”
“Mary - completed - health and safety training”
“John - read - LearnUpon's help guide”.
xAPI uses these statements to track data about learner actions and reports them back to a learning management system, Learning Record Store (LRS), or any application that understands the xAPI language.
The role of the Learning Record Store
An LRS specializes in managing data about learning experiences. Although it can be integrated with an LMS, the LRS itself is a separate product. An LRS isn't essential to using xAPI. Once an LMS is xAPI compliant, it can track, store and report on relevant statements.
LearnUpon is not an LRS, for example, but stores, tracks and reports on xAPI statements for hundreds of customers. LearnUpon can also integrate with an LRS if you need advanced analytics functionality.
Some of the main LRS vendors include:
The benefits of xAPI
Its flexibility makes xAPI really suited to the current environment in which learners access all kinds of materials in all kinds of locations. We can now learn anywhere: while travelling to work, doing our jobs, or socializing with friends. xAPI allows us to track all of these learning experiences in one simple, consistent format.
Because xAPI tracks all learning experiences, it allows you to capture each learner's activity and see the bigger picture. The term “quantified learner” has emerged to describe this ability to track individuated learning data using technology.
The data captured can be very valuable for an organization. It can be used to review previous learning experiences. Or it can be analyzed to plan for future projects by mapping what the learner knows against what they need to know. The analysis can be used to define goals that the learner can work towards.
The detailed nature of the data also makes it easy for managers to report on who has completed which training components. The result is a far clearer understanding of your learners' training experience.
The limits of the xAPI
Some organizations believe that adopting the xAPI standard will in itself deliver beautifully designed course content. That isn't true. Using xAPI won't alter the presentation or design of a course in any way. The xAPI spec won't help you to improve user experience or the user interface.
Your content will still look and behave in the same way. xAPI only controls how data is tracked and stored. The quality of eLearning content will still be determined by the quality of the authoring tool and Instructional Design used to create it. And while xAPI is better at tracking eLearning on mobile devices, using the format won't automatically deliver responsive course content.
Our approach to xAPI at LearnUpon
At LearnUpon, we took the same approach to xAPI as we did to SCORM support: we worked to remove all the pain associated with importing third-party content to the LMS. The result is that LearnUpon's xAPI feature allows customers to import their content in seconds.

MANILA, Philippines -- A Canadian man facing charges of illegal possession of firearms opened fire in a Philippine courtroom Tuesday, killing two people and wounding a prosecutor before police fatally shot him, officials said.
The suspect, John Pope, 63, appeared in court in central Cebu city, where he resided, to face the charges when he pulled out a gun and shot a lawyer and a physician who filed a case against him, police said. He then fired at a prosecutor in the hallway of the building before responding police fatally wounded him, said police Chief Mariano Natuel.
Regional police director Marcelo Garbo said Pope ignored orders to surrender and tried to fire at police.
The Philippine Star reported on its website Tuesday that Pope was carrying two firearms, a .357 revolver which he used to shoot the victims, and a .45 pistol police later recovered from a bag he carried.
Police said they were investigating Pope's background.
Local media mentioned Pope in 2011, when he was held by police on charges of illegal possession of firearms. The same physician who was killed in Tuesday's shooting accused Pope, his neighbour, of brandishing a weapon and threatening him and other residents in their condominium.
Pope was quoted as saying at the time that the pistol he was carrying was for self-defence. Apart from illegal weapons possession, he was also charged with malicious mischief and grave threats.
The shooting came after several recent killings in the country that prompted calls for a tighter gun control.

The small town of Virden, Man., prepared to house dozens of people stranded due to a winter storm that is bearing down on the southern Prairies.
Hotels in the town of about 3,000 people, located approximately 270 kilometres west of Winnipeg along the Trans-Canada Highway, are booked solid as roads closed due to poor visibility and snow cover Tuesday morning.
"Right now we've been contacted by our Virden detachment that there are quite a few stranded travellers in Virden, mainly coming from the west, from Saskatchewan, not knowing that the highway is closed here in Manitoba," said Rob Cyrenne, a spokesperson for RCMP.
Just after 6 p.m. local time, RCMP opened the Trans-Canada between Portage la Prairie and Headingley but stretches of the highway further west remain closed.

There are about five kilometres of trucks backed up, said Cyrenne. The Tundra Oil and Gas Centre is being opened in Virden to accommodate the stranded travellers.
"I haven't seen such thing in 15 years [of driving] in Canada," said Mojeeb Sahar, a truck driver stuck in a line of semis stretching about five kilometres west of Virden. "I haven't seen such ice. You can see a layer of ice on the pavement."
As of Tuesday afternoon, Sahar and his cousin were still parked in his transport truck about two kilometres west of Virden, where they'd been since this morning. The pair started their trip in Calgary and were heading to Winnipeg.
They made it to Virden Tuesday morning after hitting the ditch near Wolseley, Sask., overnight. It took them five hours to get out.
"It was [a] snowbank on the street," he said. "Once we hit the snow pile it just took us off the road into the ditch."
Southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan could see up to 30 centimetres of snow by the time the system passes on Wednesday.
The Trans-Canada Highway was closed Tuesday morning between Headingley, Man., and the Saskatchewan border.
Sahar said he wasn't able to leave the load he is carrying and didn't know where he would spend the night. He and his cousin were also running low on food by early afternoon.
"All we have is a few bottles of water left," he said, along with a few candies he'd brought along for the trip.
He said this is his first month driving a transport truck. He drove limos across Alberta and Western Canada for 15 years.
Truck driver Mojeeb Sahar was stuck in a line of trucks stranded about two kilometres outside of Virden, Man. on Tuesday afternoon. (Mojeeb Sahar ) Marcy Moorehead, the front desk manager at Comfort Inn in Virden, said the hotels have been inundated with travellers looking for rooms.
"I've had to turn away a lot of people," she said. "We're totally booked up and all of the hotels along the main drag here are full."
The Town of Virden has opened Tundra Oil and Gas Place, the town's arena and community centre, for travellers and is preparing for between 40 and 60 people to stay at the complex overnight, according to Mayor Jeff McConnell.
Jackson to play impromptu show
More than 20 people had registered to stay as of 4 p.m. according to Tracy Howard, a manager at the centre. Those staying will sleep on cots in the main hall.

Among those staying at the centre are singer and actor Tom Jackson and his band. They were scheduled to play in Brandon Tuesday evening. But after getting stranded in Virden, they instead planned to play an impromptu concert in the town Tuesday night.
"We decided well if we were here and we were going to play anyway and we love to play, so we thought maybe we would share some good cheer if we set up at the evacuation centre," Jackson said.
Jackson said he has been talking to people at the evacuation centre and "there is a lot of us making new friends here in Virden."
Sahar said people should avoid travel on the highways if at all possible Tuesday evening because of the conditions. He hadn't heard when the highway might re-open, but said he'd pass the time in his truck until it does.
"I was just playing some poker and I ran out of my chips, so now we're doing some videos and watching some videos," he said.
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (March 5, 2017) – The U.S. Under-20 Men's National Team won the 2017 CONCACAF U-20 Championship by defeating Honduras 5-3 on penalty kicks following a 0-0 draw in Sunday's Final. After going perfect through the first four rounds of the shootout, Danny Acosta slotted the game-winning penalty kick into the lower left corner to earn the U.S. its first CONCACAF title at the U-20 level.
Following the match, U.S. captain Erik Palmer-Brown was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player, while Jonathan Klinsmann won the Golden Glove as best goalkeeper.
Honduras ceded much of the first-half possession to the USA, but the U-20 MNT's best chances both came on dead-ball opportunities. In the ninth minute, Justen Glad's glancing header off Brooks Lennon's corner kick required a big stop out of Honduras goalkeeper Javier Delgado. In the 27th minute, Lennon's direct free kick from just outside the box forced Delgado into an acrobatic stop.
The U.S. came close again in the 50th minute when Emmanuel Sabbi's header off Lennon's free kick was kept out by Delgado at the right post. U-20 MNT captain Erik Palmer-Brown shut down Honduras' best chance of the match, sweeping Darixon Vuelto's breakaway in the 75th minute, while Honduras defender Dylan Andrade's clearance on Sabbi's 89th minute cross ensured the match would head to penalty kicks.
Both teams impressively converted each of their attempts through the first three rounds of the shootout. After Luca de la Torre placed his fourth round effort inside the top right corner, the U.S. received the break it needed as Rembrandt Flores fired his attempt high and wide of goal. That set up Acosta for the game-winning penalty, where the Real Salt Lake defender calmly placed his effort inside the lower left post.

Some time ago, I migrated my WordPress blog to Jekyll for different reasons including performance, security, and hosting costs - but mainly because I lost too much time maintaining the platform and the plugins up-to-date. So far, I'm very happy about the result.
But I had to change the way I'm writing posts I intend to publish later. In WordPress, the process is very simple: write a draft anytime you want; edit it to your heart's content and when ready, hit publish. Done.
Jekyll is quite different. The site is generated statically so that there's no magical button to click in order to publish. Posts are written in Markdown (or Asciidoc): in order to get the HTML, the site needs to be generated.
There are several ways to manage the management of publications with Jekyll. This post is dedicated to a few of them.
Posts are stored in a specific _posts folder. Each post is tagged with a publishing date. When generating the HTML site, only posts whose publish date are not after the date of the day are generated. Given the above behavior, the easiest way to publish is just to create posts with a date set in the future. That way, on D-day, re-generating the site will publish the new post. In order to preview the generated post before that date, the generation process can be launched with the --future option. This strategy requires knowing the date a post will be published in advance. If no publication date can be planned, the next strategy is useful.
Using drafts In order for a post to be generated, it needs to have its type meta-data set to…​ post . This is the case by default. But if the type is set to draft , they won't be generated unless Jekyll build is launched with the --drafts option. For better management, all such drafts can (should?) be stored in a _drafts folder. When one wants to publish a draft, change the type from draft to post - and optionally move it to the main posts folder.
Using a VCS When using a Version Control System - and I do hope it's the case, posts/drafts can also be written in a specific publication branch e.g. feature/new_posts . Changing branch will preview those new posts with no consequence to the master branch. Publishing requires just cherry-picking the commit of the wanted post. Of course, it's possible to combine cherry-picking with the above options to achieve full flexibility. As an added benefit to cherry-pick new publications from a dedicated branch, this branch can be cleaned up from time to time to keep the number of posts low, and the generation time as well.
College student, 19, 'poisoned her roommate's iced tea with BLEACH after an argument over dirty dishes'
Kayla Ashlyn Bonkowski, 19, charged with felony poisoning in Michigan
Told police her roommate Emily Joseph, 20, was acting 'mean'
A college student faces 15 years in jail after she allegedly sprayed bleach into her roommate's iced tea.
Kayla Ashlyn Bonkowski, 19, was charged with felony poisoning and appeared in court on Wednesday. She reportedly told police that she had put chemicals in the drink following an argument about cleaning the dishes with her 20-year-old roommate Emily Joseph.
The poisoning occurred on November 7 at the students' apartment in Union Township, located near the Mount Pleasant school of Central Michigan University, authorities said.
Roommate: Kayla Ashlyn Bonkowski, 19, has been charged with felony poisoning after she poured bleach into her roommates iced tea in Michicgan
Miss Joseph was taken to hospital for treatment but later released. After she filed a complaint, Bonkowski was arrested.
The 19-year-old 'verbally admitted' to police that she put bleach in the drink because 'Joseph is mean', according to ABC .
She was arraigned on Wednesday at 2pm before posting $2,000 bond. She entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of poisoning a food, drink, medicine or water supply. The college student faces up to 15 years in prison.
Reached by e-mail, Bonkowski said on Wednesday morning that she needed to consult with a lawyer before commenting. University officials declined to make a statement at this time.
Bonkowski is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on December 13.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Yadira Guillermo Garcia demanded that her husband be released "safe and sound"
Vigilantes in a Mexican village have seized the mother of a local gang leader and proposed swapping her for a kidnap victim taken on Monday.
After seizing alleged collaborators of the gang, including the mother of the leader "El Tequilero", the locals have recorded video messages for the gang.
"In return for my husband's life, I will deliver your mother," says the kidnap victim's wife in one video, which has been broadcast on local TV.
Police have been sent to the village.
"We have your mother here, mister known as El Tequilero," says Yadira Guillermo Garcia, whose husband, an engineer, was seized by the gang, addressing the gang leader.
"I request an exchange.... I want him safe and sound."
Image copyright YouTube Image caption Masked residents said they had taken up arms to defend themselves against the local gangs
In another video, residents of San Miguel Totolapan, carrying guns, explain that they have suffered for too long from the violence and intimidation meted out by El Tequilero and his gang, which is feared for carrying out mass kidnappings.
"They have humiliated us, they have killed our families and we won't let it happen again," one of them says.
Elusive gang boss
Police have been trying to track down El Tequilero, whose real name is Raybel Jacobo de Almonte, for weeks now.
At the end of November, police used helicopters to search the mountainous area in Guerrero state where he is believed to be hiding but failed to catch him.
The governor of Guerrero state, Hector Astudillo, said more than 200 police officers and soldiers had been sent to San Miguel Totolapan to defuse the stand-off.
He said the villagers had released five of the people they were holding but that El Tequilero's mother was not among them.
Guerrero state officials said that a team had been set up to negotiate between the vigilantes and the gang.
"The goal of the team is to ensure that no injury is done to the missing person, nor to the mother of the head of the Tequileros gang, who has apparently been taken by the self-defence forces," a statement read.
Guerrero state is a hotbed of gangs and violent crime, where local gangs fight for control of the opium trade, and disappearances and kidnapping for ransom are common.
In a number of towns and villages, residents have created vigilante groups in response, but human rights groups say these have only further contributed to the spiral of violence.
If you thought that TV channels had gone overboard in urging for mercy for 1993 Mumbai blasts convict Yakub Memon before his eventual hanging, you have found a friend in the NDA government.
A report in The Indian Express mentions that the Union Information and Broadcasting ministry has issued show-cause notices to three TV channels for showing content which showed disrespect to the President of India and the judiciary.
The channels which have been served are ABP News, NDTV 24×7 and Aaj Tak.
Aaj Tak and ABP News are in the firing line for running a phone-in with gangster Chhota Shakeel. In the interviews, Shakeel claims that Memon is innocent and that his four mercy petitions had been rejected in a single day and alleges that justice was not carried out in Memon's case.
Here is the link to the ABP news article.
The Aaj Tak phone-in transcript can be found in full here and the interview was also run by its English sister channel India Today.
English news channel NDTV has come under the scanner for running an interview with Memon's lawyer who cited the revocation of the death penalty in several western countries as a reason to spare his client.
Here is the NDTV debate.
The report mentions that the show-cause notices issued to the three channels cites the breach of three sections of the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994.
According to Section 1(d), no programme which contains any “obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggestive innuendos and half-truths” should find itself on air.
Section 1(e) mentions that cable channels should not air anything which is “likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order or which promote anti-national attitudes.”

Rise of fraud TV babas, sadhvis and quacks is an awful scourge. That's what I&B shd worry about, not try bullying news media & look idiotic — Shekhar Gupta (@ShekharGupta) August 8, 2015
Memon was hanged early on July 30 and his execution brought up the debate surrounding the death penalty again.
Mourinho says the new deal shows Hazard believes in the club's coaching staff
Belgium midfielder Eden Hazard has signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with Premier League leaders Chelsea.
The 24-year-old, signed for a reported £32m from Lille in 2012, has scored 13 times in 36 appearances this season.
"Since I came here in 2012, I have always felt good and the club has been very supportive to me," Hazard said.
"He is already a top player and his evolution has been fantastic," manager Jose Mourinho said. "He is still very young and he can become the best."
Hazard's Belgium side were beaten in the World Cup quarter-finals by Argentina
Hazard, who helped Belgium reach the World Cup quarter-finals last year, has made a total 147 appearances for the Blues, scoring 43 goals.
"The manager has helped me improve a lot, the fans have been fantastic and I have an amazing understanding with my team-mates," he added.
"I always try to give pleasure to the supporters with my style of play and it is nice to know they appreciate my work."
Despite the assessment of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) that Denmark faces an increased risk of a terror attack , Danes are less fearful of terrorism today than they were a decade ago.
An opinion poll carried out by Epinion for broadcaster DR showed that one in three Danes fear that Denmark will be targetted by a terrorist attack within the next year. That is down from nearly half of all Danes in August 2005.
In the new poll, 33 percent of respondents said they believed that Denmark would be hit by a terror attack, forty-two percent did not fear an attack and a quarter of respondents were unsure.
When the same question was posed in August 2005, 47 percent of Danes thought there would be a terror attack on Danish soil, 41 percent did not and 12 percent said they didn't know.
The poll results come shortly after PET's Center for Terror Analysis (CTA) released a new threat level assessment that carried a small but significant change in language. The CTA report stated that “the terror threat against Denmark is serious, but the risk of being the victim of a terror attack in Denmark is limited”.
In CTA's previous threat level assessment, the agency called the risk of a terror attack “very limited”.
The head of PET, Jens Madsen, said that the language change was an intentional reflection of “negative developments in the current terror situation”.
“This is particularly due to the fact that we are continuing to see a stream of people leaving Denmark for the conflict in Syria and Iraq,” Madsen told DR.
The decreasing concern that Denmark will be targeted by terrorists also comes despite a Danish-Turkish militant who has fought alongside Isis in Syria warning that "Denmark is high up on the list" of the terror group's potential targets
That Danes are less concerned about terrorism now than in 2005 came as now surprise to TrygFonden, a foundation that focuses on safety, health and well-being.
The foundation's director of research said that terrorism is always much further down the list of Danes' worries than more practical issues.
“The fear of terror is not something that keeps many Danes awake at night. Compared to the fear of an unexpected expense that you can't pay or the fear of being homeless, it's not something that affects their daily lives,” Anders Hede told DR.

A groundbreaking report released on April 1, 2014 by the ACCE Institute and Common Cause reveals that Big Oil spent $123.6 million to lobby elected officials in California over the past 15 years, an increase of over 400 percent since the 1999-2000 legislative session, when the industry spent $4.8 million.
The report, “Big Oil Floods the Capitol: How California's Oil Companies Funnel Funds Into the Legislature,” highlights the growing influence of the Oil and Gas Lobby in Sacramento, including the increasing power of the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA). The analysis examines the broad and expanding scope of the oil and gas industry's spending in Sacramento as the industry gears up to expand fracking (hydraulic fracturing) operations in California facilitated by the passage of Senator Fran Pavley's Senate Bill 4 last September.
The report also examines historical campaign contributions by the largest firms in the oil and gas industry. Over the last fifteen years, Big Oil has spent $143.3 million on political candidates and campaigns – nearly $10 million per year and more than any other corporate lobby.
The report also exposes how the oil and gas lobby has spent nearly $15 million to influence Sacramento lawmakers halfway through the 2014-15 legislative session. The record is $25.5 million, set in 2011-12.
As one of the few journalists willing to expose the power of the oil industry in California in recent years, I am very pleased that Common Cause and ACCE have put together this invaluable report that confirms what I've been saying all along – that the oil industry has overwhelmed and corrupted the political process, including hijacking what passes for “marine protection” and “environmental protection” in California.
The report was unveiled as the arrests of three State Senators on criminal charges in recent months have put the spotlight on corruption and influence peddling at the State Capitol.
On March 29, the State Senate voted to suspend Senators Leland Yee, Ron Calderon and Rod Wright, who are being prosecuted in separate criminal cases, after Yee refused to resign. Yee was arrested on federal charges of accepting bribes and coordinating an international gun-running operation,revealed in an affidavit that read like a bizarre crime novel.
One of the three Senators, Rod Wright, received more oil industry money, $83,100, than any other legislator during the 15-year period, according to the report.
“On the heels of 3 California Senators facing separate accusations of influence peddling and unethical behavior, it has never been more important to shine a light on the money that industries like Big Oil spend to advance their agenda,” said Vivian Richardson, community leader and Board Chair of ACCE, in a news release announcing the publication of the report. “We've had enough of this ‘pay to play' system in which money talks – it's time for our elected officials to listen to the people of this state, and make Big Oil pay their fair share.”
“This report highlights a growing problem in Sacramento – the millions of dollars of campaign contributions and lobby spending by special interests in Sacramento, and the possible influence that goes along with it,” summed up Sarah Swanbeck, coauthor of the report and policy advocate for California Common Cause. “It is time for lawmakers to consider how these types of legal spending by special interests drown out the voice of average Californians and what legislative action can be taken to correct this imbalance.”
Chevron tops campaign contributions with $71.2 million
The report explains how key members of Big Oil. including Chevron, Exxon, Aera Energy and Occidental Petroleum, are some of the largest corporations in California. “And these big corporations spend big time,” Richardson and Swanbeck note.
The top five oil and gas industry campaign contributors from 1999 to 2013 were Chevron, $71.2 million; Aera Energy, $33.8 million; Occidental, $14.5 million; ConocoPhillips, $6.4 million; and Tesoro $3.4 million. Big Oil spent a whopping $143.3 million on political candidates and campaigns, nearly $10 million per year, over the past 15 years.
“Companies like Chevron and Aera have gone to great lengths to influence candidates and initiative campaigns in California elections,” the report states.
Environmental justice and indigenous groups accuse the San Ramon based-Chevron of environmental racism, ranging from the adverse health impacts of the pollution caused by the operation of its refinery in Richmond, California to its dumping of toxic waste in indigenous communities in the the Amazon River Basin in Ecuador.
The report also documents how individual legislators have received tens of thousands from Big Oil over their careers. Over the last 15 years, the top five currently serving legislative recipients are: (1) Senator Rod Wright ($83,100), (2) Assemblymember Isadore Hall, III ($80,600), (3) Senator Jean Fuller ($76,850), (4) Assemblymember Henry Perea ($73,050), and (5) Senator Bob Huff ($69,400).
This report profiles the top recipients, as well as those legislators who are facing a vote on the Oil and Gas Extraction Tax (Senate Bill 1017) this April.
But direct contributions are not the only way Big Oil dominates politics in Sacramento – the industry also spends millions on lobbying those same politicians every year.
Price tag for lobbying totalled $123.6 million
“In addition to its political contributions,” the report continues, “Big Oil exerts considerable influence lobbying in Sacramento. Big Oil employs high profile, high powered lobbyists to ensure their interests are represented.”
In the past 15 years, the price tag for these lobbyists has totaled $123.6 million. In 2013-2014 alone, the top lobbyist employer, the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), headed by President Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the former chair of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative to create fake “marine protected areas” in Southern California, spent $4.7 million.
To make things worse, the oil lobby presence in Sacramento is growing, as evidenced by the industry's successful campaign last year to defeat all fracking bills except one, Senator Fran Pavley's Senate Bill 4, an oil industry-friendly bill that gives the green light to increased fracking in California. The legislation was opposed by the vast majority of conservation and environmental justice groups in California – but supported by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environmental Defense Fund and California League of Conservation Voters until the last minute, when they withdrew their support after amendments were added.
“So far during the 2013-2014 session, the Oil and Gas lobby has spent nearly $15 million in Sacramento,” the report revealed. “Only halfway through the session, and with expenditure rates typically increasing late in the legislative season when more bills are up for a final vote, California is on track to surpass the roughly $25.5 million spent on lobbying in the 2011-2012 legislative session.”
Similarly, the number of oil and gas industry lobbyists in Sacramento has gone from 22 lobbyist employer organizations registered with the FPPC in 1999-2000 to 32 registered sectors for the current legislative session (2013-2014), according to the report.
Yet for the oil industry this money is mere chump change, the cost of doing business. Big Oil's estimated profits in 2014 to date are $24,978,007,900, based on information from the Center for American Progress.
The 2013 profit totals for the big five oil companies combined – BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Shell – were $93 billion, or $177,000 per minute.
As Big Oil spending rises, fracking increases
The rise of the oil industry spending documented in the report corresponds directly with the increase in fracking in Monterey Shale deposits in Kern County, coastal areas and Southern California ocean waters – and the creation of so-called “marine protected areas” that fail to protect the ocean from fracking, oil drilling, pollution military testing and all human impacts other than fishing and gathering.
Oil companies have fracked offshore wells at least 203 times over the past 20 years in the ocean near California's coast, from Seal Beach to the Santa Barbara Channel, according to Freedom of Information Act Request and media investigation by the Associated Press and truthout.org last year. (http://bigstory.ap.org/article/calif-finds-more-instances-offshore-fracking) Much of the fracking took place while WSPA President Reheis-Boyd was chairing the MLPA Initiative Blue Ribbon Task Force and serving on the Central Coast, North Central Coast and North Coast Task Forces.
The Common Cause/ACCE Institute report's data and charts also make it perfectly clear that the oil industry spending on campaigns and lobbying correlates directly with the rise to power and influence by Reheis-Boyd and her service as a “marine guardian”on federal and state marine protected area panels, as revealed by the chart on page 12 of the document.
Mainstream media outlets have failed to cover one of the biggest environmental scandals in California history, Reheis-Boyd's chairing of the MLPA Initiative Blue Ribbon Task Force to create alleged “marine protected areas” in Southern California from 2009 to 2012, as well as her “service” on the Central Coast, North Central Coast and North Coast task forces from 2004 to 2012. MLPA Initiative advocates falsely portrayed the process as “open and transparent” and based on “science” when it was anything but.
The report also counteracts the attempts of state officials and corporate “environmental” NGOs to portray a false image of a “Green California” where no one single interest dominates. David Helvarg, in a recent article on the National Geographic website praising the so-called “marine protected areas” created under the privately-funded MLPA Initiative, claims:
“With its ports, the U.S. Navy, fishermen, surfers and the coastal tourism industry, marine science centers and more no single special interest can dominate ocean policy. And it is where you have single interests dictating policy in places like Louisiana with oil and gas or Florida with real-estate developers that you see coastal seas in decline,” said Helvarg.
This statement avoids addressing the fact that the oil industry is the largest corporate lobby in California, one that dominates environmental politics like no other industry does – and that California is much closer to Louisiana and Florida in its domination by corporate interests than some California politicians and corporate “environmentalists” would like to think.

Brown's tunnels will provide water for fracking
As the oil industry plans the expansion of fracking under Senate Bill 4, Governor Jerry Brown is fast tracking the widely-contested Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) to build the peripheral tunnels.The proposed tunnels would divert Sacramento River water for use by corporate agribusiness interests, Southern California water privateers and oil companies expanding fracking and steam injection operations. The construction of the twin tunnels would hasten the extinction of Central Valley salmon, Delta and longfin smelt, green sturgeon and other fish species, as well as imperil salmon and steelhead populations on the Trinity and Klamath rivers.
Restore the Delta and Food and Water Watch revealed on March 4 that much of the area that the oil industry could frack for oil and natural gas in California is located in and near toxic, drainage-impaired land farmed by corporate agribusiness interests on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.
The same Governor promoting the peripheral tunnels and the expansion of hydraulic fracturing recently declared a drought emergency in California. A broad coalition of environmentalists, fishermen and Tribal leaders is demanding immediate halt to water-intensive fracking.
According to Oil Change International, “This drought is already devastating farmers livelihoods, causing an increased risk of wildfires, and threatening our water supplies. So why is the Governor still allowing fracking to take place? Fracking wells can consume between 2 and 10 MILLION gallons of water in their lifetime.”
In spite of false claims by the mainstream media and state officials that California is a “green state” and an “environmental leader,” the Golden State has become an “oilogarchy.”

Albuquerque, NM– Albuquerque Police Department's five months without a shooting has come to an end as an Albuquerque police officer remains in critical condition after being shot by a fellow officer on Friday.
The unnamed officer was shot while undercover during a drug operation to bust two men for $60 worth of meth. Another officer sustained minor injuries, but information on how has not been released.
Police have not released the names of any of the officers who were involved, but criminal complaints filed in Metropolitan Court against the two targets of the investigation identify the undercover officers as detectives Holly Garcia and Jacob Grant, The Albuquerque Journal reported.
According to the criminal complaint, Garcia and Grant met a suspect to buy $60 worth of “shards,” another term for meth. The suspects got into Garcia's car and she drove them to an Econo Lodge Motel. One of the suspects went into a room and returned to Garcia's vehicle with the meth.
Garcia then went to a McDonald's parking lot and gave the signal to begin the bust, the shooting took place shortly after.
Witnesses report that they heard around five shots, and the officer was shot multiple times, but the exact number has not yet been released.
Police have not yet come forward with any explanation as to why an officer opened fire, but it appears as though both of the suspects were unarmed. The pair was taken into custody on drug trafficking charges following the shooting.
Media, police, and citizens are grieving and expressing condolences, but what they are not doing is discussing why this really happened.
We don't need all the details to be able to safely assume the undercover officer was not a threat to their peers, yet they were shot anyway. Media is discussing this event using words like “tragedy” and “accident” while ignoring the fact that this is a symptom of a much larger problem, and it seems that an officer once again shot someone who posed no threat to them.
This trigger happy officer, who opened fire and shot someone who posed no danger to them, multiple times, is “devastated” according to Police Chief Gorden Eden. The lieutenant is currently on administrative leave and “getting support” through the department's counseling services.
Police even went so far as to confiscate a witness's cell phone after he had recorded some of the incident.
While brutality is clearly a nationwide issue, the APD has claimed some major notoriety for their badge abuse. Since 2010, the department has had 41 officer involved shootings, 27 of which were fatal.
In April, the department was accused of using excessive force by the Justice Department after the frightening murder of the homeless James Boyd when he was approached for “illegally camping.” Boyd was shot by an officer who had discussed his plans to shoot him in the penis hours prior. Their own police chief openly admitted that he is stuck with officers who should not be on the force.
Had the person this officer mistakenly shot, under the exact same circumstances, been one of the suspects- we would likely already know their entire history, the history of all relatives, and have been spoon fed some wild tale about the officer “fearing for their life” and having no other choice. The shooting would be written off and ultimately swept away and forgotten by the media.
Police and police apologists have not victim blamed the unnamed officer.
So was this a “tragic accident” as they say, or evidence of the systemic lack of care taken by reckless officers as they reach for their weapons?
Perhaps we should call it what it is- one more victim of our militarized police and the disastrous drug war. Nobody is safe, not even those standing behind the thin blue line.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Collins is one of the most successful songwriters of all time
British singer Phil Collins has said he is coming out of retirement and is even planning to tour.
In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he said: "I'm no longer officially retired.
"The horse is out of the stable and I'm raring to go."
The 64-year-old artist - who also played with prog-rockers Genesis - said in 2011 he was leaving music to be "a full time father to my two young sons".
Following a scheduled reissue of his solo albums he told Rolling Stone "it would be silly to not make more music."
Collins has not released a full album of new material since 2002's Testify though he topped the chart in 2010 with a collection of Motown covers called Going Back.
In 2007, a Genesis reunion tour led to a dislocated vertebra and nerve damage in his hands, leaving him unable to play the drums.

He told Rolling Stone that he was moving a studio into his home in Miami, Florida and would start recording new music next month.
His new band features Jason Bonham, the son of Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham.
In terms of a tour to support the new songs, he said: "I don't think I want a very long tour.
"But I would like to play the stadiums in Australia and the Far East, and that's the only way to do that. But there's a part of me that just wants to do theatres, so we'll see."
One of the most successful songwriters and performers of all time, Collins is one of only three recording artists, alongside Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million albums worldwide both as solo artists and as members of a band.
His number one singles include A Groovy Kind of Love and Against All Odds.
Collins has won seven Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, an Oscar and two Golden Globes.

The Pistons are in need of a superstar. There's no winning in today's NBA without one.
Andre Drummond, though paid like a superstar, doesn't fit the bill. Nor does Avery Bradley. No one else on the team comes close.
Could Kyrie Irving fill the void?
Per Vince Ellis of the Detroit Free Press, the Pistons are interested in trading for Irving, who doesn't seem long for Cleveland.
The four-time All-Star is reportedly unhappy playing second fiddle to LeBron James and wants a leading role on a new team.
This isn't the first time the Pistons have been linked to Irving since reports surfaced of his desire to be traded. And they're hardly alone.
ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported last week that “approximately 20 teams” have inquired on Irving, “but far fewer have registered legitimate proposals. More loom in the shadows, and many simply don't have the assets to make a deal happen.”
Pistons president and head coach Stan Van Gundy told Keith Langlois of the team's website that “the Pistons have had some level of conversation with the Cavs” regarding Irving.
As of Wojnarowksi's report, though, Detroit was not one of the teams to have made a formal offer.
Would the Pistons even have enough to pique Cleveland's interest? Per Wojnarowksi, “The Cavaliers want a package that resembles the 2011 Nuggets-Knicks deal for Carmelo Anthony — young players, win-now veterans and draft picks.”
For the Pistons, Drummond would likely be the centerpiece of any deal, with Reggie Jackson, Stanley Johnson and even the recently-acquired Avery Bradley in the mix as well. That's without mentioning a first-round draft pick or two.
Stan Van Gundy said at the end of last month he doesn't expect the Pistons to make another move this summer, but wouldn't rule anything out.
“I'm not sitting by the phone like I was the first 10 days of July because there's no expectation of anything, but you never know. Stuff comes up, and you're always looking,” he said. “(GM) Jeff Bower's on the phone with guys every single day and you just never know what's gonna happen. He's always working.
“There could be lower-level stuff, but you never know when anything major could come up.”
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Indians have outrighted utility man Michael Martinez, creating a spot on the 40-man roster as they prepare for the winter meetings that begin on Dec. 4 in National Harbor, Md.
They also signed outfielder Daniel Robertson to a minor-league contract with an invitation to big-league spring training.
Martinez's departure leaves the 40-man roster at 39 players. Martinez, who made the last out in Game 7 of the World Series, has played parts of the last two seasons with the Indians.
Manager Terry Francona valued Martinez, 34, because of his ability to play several positions. Martinez opened the year at Class AAA Columbus where he hit .288 (30-for-104) with eight doubles and 12 RBI.
Martinez appeared in 58 games with the Indians, hitting .242 (23-for-95) with one homer and four RBI. He was on the Tribe's active roster throughout the postseason, and made the final out of Game 7 vs. the Cubs.
He also appeared in four games with Boston before being reclaimed by the Indians.
Don't be surprised if the Indians try to re-sign Martinez to a minor-league deal with an invitation to big-league camp. That's how much Francona values him.
Robertson, 31, is a versatile right-handed hitter who spent last season with Class AAA Tacoma, the top farm club for the Mariners. He hit .287 (117-for-408) with 19 doubles, six homers and 46 RBI. He stole 13 bases in 15 attempts and posted a .769 OPS.
He played nine games with the Mariners in July, hitting .263 (5-for-19). This year Robertson played 38 games at second base, 35 in left field, 29 in center and 16 in right field for Tacoma.
Robertson made his big-league debut with the Angels in 2015 and was originally drafted by San Diego in 2008.
At the Inside the Overwatch League panel, Nate Nanzer took to the stage to outline some specifics for the upcoming Overwatch League. After crowning (well, medalling) the 2017 World Cup Champions, South Korea, Nanzer explained Blizzard's vision for the League in its inaugural season, and the developmental hurdles the League had to go through to make a lasting brand dynamic.
This also gave Nanzer time to outline the changes made to the spectator experience (which had made their debut during the World Cup matches earlier in the convention,) including top-down viewing tools and instant replay options that make the World Cup (and the Overwatch League itself) more accessible to viewers new and old.
To that end, the team has developed a new website, overwatchleague.com. While Nanzer conceded that the community's effort to aggregate professional matches and stats had been admirable, an official home for those figures would be more appropriate. The website is live now and includes team rosters and schedules, videos from in and out of the game, player statistics, and a comparison tool to see how you stack against pro players. To pair with this new site, a mobile companion app is also launching soon, where you can watch League matches, see key stat lines, and set your favorite team to receive notifications on their performance.
Nanzer was quick to mention that the Overwatch League team is not resting on these laurels by any means. More growth is to come, including much-needed expansion into Europe and Asia, more arenas, and regular home and away matches in those arenas as the League gains traction and funding. He also outlined the structure for games played in the pre- and regular seasons, with a week one schedule and a breakdown of the League's new divisional structure.
Two divisions – Atlantic and Pacific- will face off in 20 divisional and 20 out-of-division matches, Wednesday through Saturday over the course of the season, with the 20 week season being split into four five-week stages. Each stage has its own record – separate from the total season record – with the top team in each stage taking home a hefty bonus, the specifics of which are listed below.
This, according to Nanzer, will allow teams to prepare for a specific 8-map pool (to be announced before the season starts) for each stage, and to manage international travel (once all the matches aren't all played in Burbank, anyway.) Once those stages are all completed, the playoffs will feature the top 6 teams– 2 division champions, and the four next-highest teams by total season ranking.
He also announced something we've all been waiting for– merch! Jerseys for each Overwatch League team will go on sale December 6th, with hats, socks and more being added as the season progresses. With much of the groundwork laid for the League's inaugural season, Nanzer announced sales for preseason tickets starting Monday, November 6th, with the regular season starting in January and playoffs starting in early July at a separate, larger venue (which has yet to be determined.)
We at overwatchscore.com are ridiculously excited to see the season play out, and hope you'll stay with us for all your up-to-date Overwatch League News!

The 13-metre Christmas goat in Gävle, eastern Sweden, was torched late on Wednesday night last week. On Thursday, an anonymous confession popped up on the controversial Swedish internet forum Flashback.
By Saturday, a picture of four legs also appeared on the site, each with a cartoon tattoo of the flaming goat together with the time and date that the straw creature was set alight.
“This kind of tattoo isn't done by just anyone,” said Mikael Hedström of the Gävle police to the Expressen newspaper.
“But even if we find out who it is, it's no proof.”
CLICK HERE FOR A CLOSER LOOK AT THE BURNING GOAT
The police are now working to identify the person responsible for posting the messages online.
“Then we have to tie them to the crime scene. The tattoo is not enough,” Hedström told the paper.
The Flashback forum postings are not the first clues police have had.
Reports came on Thursday of four men who changed clothes in a restaurant toilet after the goat was burned, with witnesses claiming the men smelled of smoke.
The perpetrators face a risk of prison or fines for aggravated damages or arson. According to Hedström, a fine of up to 200,000 kronor ($30,300) would be reasonable.
Gävle first erected the straw sculpture in 1966, meaning this year was the goat's 46th birthday. It has been burnt to the ground for the majority of the past 46 years.

Researchers from UCLA and the University of Aarhus in Denmark have released a study that associates acetaminophen use by pregnant women with higher rates of ADHD and associated behavior in their children later in life.
Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a highly common pain reliever found in over-the-counter products like Tylenol. It is generally recommended as safe for use during pregnancy, although doctors suggest it be used in low doses, as they do with most medications.
The researchers say they need further research to verify the findings, but the results of the study show that the children of women who take acetaminophen during pregnancy have a 13 percent to 37 percent higher risk of later receiving a hospital diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder, being treated with ADHD medications or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7.
The researchers studied 64,322 mothers and children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort from 1996 to 2002. The cohort is a nationwide study of the long-term health effects of “exposures in the period from conception to early childhood.”
The researchers interviewed women three times during pregnancy and followed up with them when their child turned 7 years old. Using data from the cohort and via interviews they determined the prevalence of ADHD, its more severe form hyperkinetic disorder and other ADHD-like behavior.
More than half of the women reported using acetaminophen during pregnancy. The researchers say the results show the longer into the pregnancy a mother took acetaminophen, the higher risk of later disorders.
UCLA says “the risks for hyperkinetic disorder/ADHD in children were elevated 50 percent or more when the mothers had used the common painkiller for more than 20 weeks in pregnancy.”
Dr. Beate Ritz of UCLA, an author of the paper, said Acetaminophen can cross the placental barrier, meaning it could affect the way the brain develops in a fetus. “It's known from animal data that acetaminophen is a hormone disruptor,” says Ritz, “and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may influence fetal brain development.”
The research was undertaken as a look into avoidable causes of ADHD and related behavior. Acetaminophen was chosen because of it is the most commonly used painkiller by pregnant women.
Dr. Jørn Olsen, who took part in the study, says “we need further research to verify these findings, but if these results reflect causal associations, then acetaminophen should no longer be considered a 'safe' drug for use in pregnancy."
Last week, I set out the ASI's position on tax policy in 2017. In making the case for scrapping all taxes on capital, I mentioned that existing tax rates and reasonable interest rates imply massive taxes on future consumption.
"Taxes on interest income, capital gains, inheritance and corporate profits all effectively tax future consumption higher than current consumption, incentivising short-termism. And this future consumption tax goes up every year you forgo instant gratification. A few months back, I did the maths. Assuming a 5% interest rate and the European Commission's estimate for the Marginal Effective Tax Rate on capital (47%), you're effectively paying 97% extra in tax for waiting 30 years and a whopping 147% if you leave it another 10 years."
I think it's worth expanding on this point, but the mechanism isn't exactly clear. Why does a 47% tax on capital imply a 147% tax rate 40 years down the line? It's worth going back to basics.
People prefer to have things now rather than later. Market interest rates reveal how strong that preference is. If the market rate of interest is 5% (high for today but not by historical standards) then it means £100 of consumption today is worth £162.29 of consumption in ten years time.
Should I spend now or save for tomorrow? Capital taxes distort that choice. Let's pretend we have a flat 20% income tax with no deductions or exemptions. If you get paid £125, you'll pay £25 in tax and then you can choose to save or spend the rest of the money. If you saved £50 and the market interest rate was 5% you would end up with £81.44. But you'd have to pay 20% of your interest income each year in tax. Leaving you with £74.01.
It's the equivalent of the interest rate falling from 5% to 4%. That might not make much of a difference over 10 years. That's just £7.43 extra in tax, effectively a 10% additional tax on consumption. Not huge, not small either, but not huge.
However, as Einstein probably never actually said "compound interest is the most powerful force in the world". The difference between a bank account paying out 4% and one paying 5% becomes much larger over 30 years (4% = £162.17, 5% = £216). That's a difference of £53.93, or to put it more generally you'd be almost a 1/3 richer with an account paying 5%. To put it another way, a flat income tax of 20% implies an extra 33% tax on consumption in 30 years time. The longer you wait to bigger the extra tax you must pay is.
But we don't have a flat tax of 20%. We have an income tax with a top rate of 45%, a corporation tax of 20%, capital gains tax of 20% (not to mention inheritance tax). We also have some tax exempt savings vehicles like ISAs but they have a maximum limit so those most able to increase savings are still taxed.
To figure out how high the extra taxes on future consumption are we need to know the marginal effective tax rate (METR) on capital. Unfortunately that's rather tricky to work out. The best estimate I could find is from 2000 and by the European Commission, they reckon the UK's METR is 47%. Things have changed since then - income tax and capital gains tax is higher, while corporation tax has fallen, so buyer beware. But, an METR of 47% means a consumption tax of 97% in 30 years time. And if you waited another 10 years that tax would rise to 147% (even Jeremy Corbyn's bonkers maximum salary cap only implies a 100% rate).
Tax rates of 97% and above are absurd. Yet, rates like these are the status quo for those who defer gratification and make productive investments. This isn't just bad for those rich enough to max out their ISA limit, it's bad for ordinary workers as their wages stagnate due to chronic under-investment.
The tax code should be neutral between the frugal and the spendthrift. In 2017 we'll be pushing for tax reforms that fix this imbalance.

After 340 days aboard the International Space Station—the longest stretch for any NASA astronaut—recent ISS Commander Scott Kelly is back on Earth and reflecting on his year in orbit. During a press conference on Friday, the astronaut shared his thoughts on a manned mission to Mars, the utility of virtual reality in space, and how staring down at the Earth for a year changes your view on environmentalism.
Though there are still a year's worth of physical tests ahead of him and his twin brother, Mark, and much analysis to be done before we start to understand the true impact of living in zero gravity for close to 12 months, Kelly was able to share some first impressions after arriving back home Wednesday.
"The only big surprise was how long a year is," Kelly said about the mission. "It seemed like I had lived there forever. It seemed longer than I thought it would be."
Kelly said that, compared to the shorter stints he had done aboard the ISS, he was feeling more intense physical shocks after coming back to Earth this time. He said he is experiencing more severe muscle soreness and fatigue and that his skin has become extremely sensitive, to the point where even clothing and shoes can cause a burning sensation. Kelly also said he thinks his coordination is a bit off as he adjusts back to life with gravity, noting some trouble he had shooting basketballs Thursday. But he also felt confident that a longer spaceflight would be completely reasonable for any properly trained astronaut.
"I personally think going to Mars, if it takes two years or two and a half years, yeah that's doable," Kelly said about a potential manned mission to the Red Planet. "Certainly the first people that go there, that's going to be a big motivator: being first to go to Mars."
One point Kelly made more than once was that his time in space gave him a new concern for the environment. He noted that, from the vantage point of the ISS, he could observe numerous environmental impacts—pollution in parts of Asia, wildfires in California—as well as the notably thin atmosphere.
"You just notice how thin the atmosphere is, how fragile it looks, and that combined with large swaths of pollution is somewhat alarming," Kelly said. "We've got to take care of the environment. People say 'save the planet,' but the planet will be just fine. It's us that's going to have a problem."
While on board, the crew conducted a number of experiments, including testing out a HoloLens device. Kelly said he believes augmented reality and virtual reality technology could be a major asset for space work, especially when connected to the support team on Earth. A maintenance procedure, for example, could be performed wearing augmented reality goggles with the instructions right in front of the astronaut's eyes, and the ability for remote experts to highlight specific tools or elements. Kelly said the goggles they tested were also equipped with an alien invasion video game, which for some reason didn't freak out any of the crew.
"It actually has a game on it where there are alien spaceships coming inside the space station and you gotta shoot 'em with your finger," Kelly said. "We were playing around with that and it didn't seem to make anyone sick. It was kind of fun."
After he landed back on Earth, his first meal was a ripe banana—a choice he later realized was particularly appropriate given his recent gorilla suit appearance on the ISS—and when he finally got back to his home in Texas after traveling from Kazakhstan where the Soyuz capsule landed, he hopped in his pool:
Great to be back on Scott KellyMarch 3, 2016
"You want to get that water around you," he said. "We make due with not having a shower on board and it's not like you feel dirty, but you definitely feel like you would like to jump in a pool. So I did."
Mumbai: Intel reports suggest that abandonment mafia don Dawood Ibrahim and his long-time supporter Chhota Shakeel have torn their association.
As per the sources of The Times of India, in India's intelligence agencies informed that Shakeel has also moved from Karachi's Clifton area to a mysterious spot.
The Key reason for their cracking is said to be Anees Ibrahim, the younger brother of 1993 Mumbai blasts instigator Dawood Ibrahim. Reports say Shakeel in recent times had hot talks with Dawood over Anees' alleged meddling in the activities of the gang.
Dawood Ibrahim has been downhearted and all credit goes to his son, who has decided to become a Maulana
Anees dwells with Dawood in Pakistan, while his second brother Iqbal lives in Mumbai, India.
TOI has cited a gangster; expatriated from Dubai, as informing that it was "next to impossible" that Shakeel would part ways with Dawood. "Even Dawood's brothers might ditch him, but not Shakeel. He has been loyal to Dawood all his life. And if there are some differences between them, it could only be because of Anees."
Fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim's properties auctioned. But who bought them?
Intelligence Bureau sources suggest that Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence is working on a patch-up between Dawood and Shakeel as it fears the fallout would hamper its activities against India.
In recent times The Maharashtra Police had filed its charge sheet in opposition to Dawood's brother Iqbal Ibrahim Kaskar in the extortion case of a Thane builder.

Who will lead Marquette in scoring?
It's a question that isn't important as much as it is interesting. Will Duane Wilson, the team's leading returnee in scoring, default as the new squad's go-to guy? Or will Henry Ellenson, the prized, freshman power-forward, storm through the Bradley Center gates as the team's most overwhelming force on the offensive end?
In asking these questions, one must also wonder how the entire ranks of scorers shall unfold as the season develops. Everyone's scoring output will likely increase; it's just a matter of how much — or how little — the player's bucket-getting will jump. Who will lead Marquette in scoring, and which players will follow?
1. Henry Ellenson — (Floor: 13.0 PPG, Ceiling: 17.0 PPG)
Henry Ellenson is going to be a very, very good basketball player. He led the team in scoring on the trip to Italy, and more importantly, he performed at an incredibly high level on many different types of plays. He was persistent under the hoop, he led the fast break, and he showed his ability to hit long-range jumpers. Hank isn't yet a vocal, on-the-court leader, but he looks as consistent, comfortable and impressive on the floor as anyone in college basketball.
2. Duane Wilson — (Floor: 12.0 PPG, Ceiling: 15.0 PPG)
Duane Wilson, who posted one of the best freshman seasons in Marquette basketball history last year, should benefit from a number of things for the upcoming campaign. A year of experience, a leadership role, and a talented roster place him in a position to improve his production and efficiency. Although Henry Ellenson might be the best option for scoring, it shall be Duane Wilson — the tough, vocal guard — who will command the offense from tipoff to the final buzzer.
3. Luke Fischer — (Floor: 12.0 PPG, Ceiling: 14.0 PPG)
Luke Fischer posted very solid numbers last year despite suffering and playing through a shoulder injury. At full strength on the team's trip to Italy, he looked even more confident, skilled and powerful on both ends of the floor, especially under the basket.
4. Sandy Cohen — (Floor: 5.0 PPG, Ceiling: 8.0 PPG)
Last season, Cohen played only 15 minutes per game, averaged only 3.8 PPG and ranked in the bottom half of the team in eFG%. However, the team lost six of the ten players on last year's season-opening roster and gained another six in the process. Cohen is both a returnee and one of the few players on Marquette with college basketball experience. His bigger role will demand more responsibility, and judging from his solid play, quality minutes and starting role in Italy, it is safe to say the coaches trust him to fulfill the requirements.
5. Traci Carter — (Floor: 5.0 PPG, Ceiling: 8.0 PPG)
“The Engine” is a tough point guard who always plays the game at full-speed. This trait allows him to execute some impressive plays, however, it also gets him into some trouble in terms of turnovers and shot-selection. As he outgrows his “rookie mistakes” in his first season, I expect Carter to play as confidently and as intensely as anyone on the floor.
6. Jajuan Johnson — (Floor: 5.0 PPG, Ceiling: 8.0 PPG)
The nationally-ranked prize of the 2013 recruiting class has not risen to expectations in his first two seasons as a Golden Eagle. He shows flashes of speed in transition and in driving to the basket, but his underwhelming defense, questionable basketball instincts and poor shooting hinder him from exploiting the opponent. He worked on his shooting mechanics during the offseason with assistant coach Brett Nelson, and while he seems to be a more efficient scorer, he in return seems uncomfortable with himself on the court. In the most competitive game in Italy, Johnson barely saw the floor and scored one point. Even if Johnson has improved to some degree, it doesn't seem like the coaches trust him as of now to utilize the new-found skills.
7. Haanif Cheatham — (Floor: 4.0 PPG, Ceiling: 7.0 PPG)
Cheatham, who many expected to play as a “combo guard” or “wing,” will be something like a point guard for the Golden Eagles in the upcoming season. He and Carter are practicing as the primary ball-handlers and Coach Wojo seems committed to this deployment. Although this role limits him in a sense of scoring, it shall garner him a good amount of playing time (and thus opportunity) in his rookie season as a Golden Eagle.
8. Sacar Anim — (Floor: 2.0 PPG, Ceiling: 4.0 PPG)
Anim, an excellent athlete and defender, will be something like a “utility player” for substitutions, energy, and defense. As a guard and forward, he possesses a good foundation of perimeter and inside-the-arc scoring, but his offensive abilities are not yet overwhelming enough to be a consistent threat. He will develop as his career unfolds, and, for now, he will be a good option off the bench.
9. Matt Heldt — (Floor: 2.0 PPG, Ceiling: 4.0 PPG)
Heldt will receive very little time in big-stage games and a lot of garbage minutes in blowout victories. He boasts size and skill, but the team already has Henry Ellenson and Luke Fischer under the hoop. I expect him to play hard and flash his all-around skills until he progresses into a bigger role as his career develops.
10. Wally Ellenson — (Floor: 1.0 PPG, Ceiling: 3.0 PPG)
Wally Ellenson doesn't do much other than look for putbacks, fast breaks and rebounds, and that's totally okay. His incredible athleticism and unusual instincts will help us in many game situations. Hopefully, he can use them to achieve a spot on SportCenter's Top Ten Plays.

Felix Rosenqvist has confirmed he's kept hold of his race seat for the next round at the Nurburgring after doing enough to impress the head of Mercedes' DTM operations.
The Swedish driver stepped in for the F1-bound Esteban Ocon in Moscow and secured a points finish in his maiden race in the German series.
The initial confirmation had been only for Rosenqvist to race in Moscow but the 2015 European Formula 3 champion has been handed a second outing at the Nurburgring with the Mercedes-Benz DTM Team ART squad.
"We sat down together after the race weekend, and Uli Fritz [head of Mercedes DTM] told me that I will be driving again at the N?rburgring," Rosenqvist said. "I'm really pleased about that. I can hardly wait and hope that I can repeat my performance from Moscow again in the Eiffel."
As well as his DTM exploits, Rosenqvist has recently been confirmed for the third season of Formula E after replacing Bruno Senna in the Mahindra Racing driver line-up alongside Nick Heidfeld. The Swedish driver is also completing in selected Indy Lights rounds in the USA this season.
Ocean Safety lifeguards rescued eleven people in two incidents on Oahu.
At around 4:00 p.m., lifeguards rescued five military service members and a sixth man at Spitting Caves.
A 19-year old male jumped off the cliff and got into trouble quickly. His four companions jumped in after him along with a sixth man.
Lifeguards on rescue watercraft rescued all six men, and brought them all safely to shore at the Maunalua Bay.
Ocean Safety says surf was averaging 10 foot faces at times on the east shore of Oahu.
Then at 4:30 p.m., lifeguards rescued five people off of Pokai Bay.
A boy was swept out by the tide pools off Glenmonger St. and four adults went out to rescue the boy. All five people were rescued by lifeguards on rescue watercrafts. EMS reported no serious injuries.
With summer fast approaching, safety personnel across the state have been preparing for a large influx of locals and visitors at the beach.
Lifeguards say beaches everywhere are busy year-round, but in the summer, there are some shorelines where lifeguards see more activity, especially on long weekends like Memorial Day.
Ocean Safety is strongly urging caution during the high surf times.
Officials gave a few pointers for the public to stay safe:
Armin Van Buuren interviewed by DJ Mag, calls Avicii-like records ‘a trick'
Armin Van Buuren recently spoke with DJ Mag about everything from summer in Ibiza to ASOT 550 to the current state of EDM. Th
e interview is extensive, but like Pete Tong's candid piece for Miami Music Week, it's quite revealing. Armin rightfully recognizes that EDM has become “the 2012 pop music,” and credits social media and YouTube — along with the rise of dubstep Stateside — for making it viral and giving it the radio play to hit critical mass. The interviewer asks if the “drive towards the big room synths, like Avicii” has anything to do with the shift, and Armin has an unsurprisingly honest stance. “I think it's a temporary thing to be honest,” he said, before going on to talk about the double-edged sword of the massive attention on EDM right now. For some of our favorite quotes, keep reading.
Armin has quite a bit to say about Avicii's music, saying that “it's a trick” and draws the connection to ticket sales.
“I'm not all of a sudden going to make Avicii-like records just because I can do it. It's a trick, I mean he's very good at it, I don't know if I could ‘beat' him so I'm not even going to try. I'm going to stick to my sound. I want to make what I want to make, and I want to make the sound that I believe in, and I want to bring that across.”
Avicii isn't the only artist he sounds off on.
“I mean, in all honesty if I listen to a few DJs of my colleagues right now I like their sets but it's so mainstream driven.”
Armin reveals what DJing is to him, which seems at a direct jab at some of the big players out there.
“This is the way that I see the art of DJing: the art of DJing is not playing all of those big records in a row. The art of DJing is playing a set which builds towards something. Yes, of course with a few big records, but it's more the story that's important, the journey, than the actual hits that you play.”
Interestingly, Armin also says that he wanted to stop at ASOT 500, but that the fans wanted it to keep going. He talks about all of the interaction he does with his fans, and the fact that he has a full team dedicated that watches the Internet to get reactions to certain tracks.
“Sometimes the people really surprise me and that's where I've learned to never underestimate my crowd… I get educated by my own crowd; I can be testing a track and get a reaction that I really didn't expect. It's really great to interact, and I learn from that every show.”
To read more about Armin's summer plans for Privilege Ibiza, some of the vocalists he'd like to work with, and the full interview, head over to DJ Mag.

As told to Nancy Dillon:
Donald Trump is the chaos President — and it's time that he resign.
He has failed this country in less than two weeks on the job, decimating sacred American ideals and sparking momentous protests in our streets and airports.
His executive order selectively banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries as well as vulnerable refugees goes against the Constitution.
Homeland Security boss didn't see last draft of Trump refugee ban
It clearly places a religious litmus test at the border, with minority religious groups receiving preferential treatment over their Muslim counterparts.
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates made a courageous and principled stand against the egregious order, and Trump's ego couldn't take it. He fired her.
He is ignorant of history and facts and has no interest in learning. He reacts based on his emotion and his "alternative facts."
When he previously called for a "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the U.S. in 2015, I invited him to see my Broadway musical "Allegiance," based on my personal experience as a child in two U.S. internment camps during World War II.
New York officially joins legal fight against Trump's travel ban
We reserved a seat for him every night. He never came.
I wasn't surprised. I was on his show "Celebrity Apprentice" and know how stubborn he is. Part of education is having students willing to learn. He isn't willing. You can present him with empirical data, and he chooses his own "alternative facts."
It's a fact that more than 120,000 innocent Japanese Americans were rounded up and placed in camps starting in 1942. "Allegiance" is a reminder that we as a country have the capacity to do something that horrific and un-American.
Less than two weeks on the job and Trump has already failed the nation, Takei says. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
I will never forget the terrorizing morning two soldiers marched up the driveway of my family's two-bedroom home in Los Angeles carrying rifles with shiny bayonets. They stomped up the front porch and pounded on the front door with their fists.
Brooklyn judge who granted stay presides over naturalization
Tears were streaming down my mother's face as we left.
Our first stop was the Santa Anita racetrack because the camps were not built yet. We were herded over to the stable area, where each family was assigned one horse stall. The stench of horse manure was still pungent.
For my parents, it was a degrading, humiliating, terrifying experience.
About two months later, we took a long train ride to a camp in Arkansas. I went to school behind barbed wire fencing. Outside my schoolhouse windows, I could see machine guns pointed down at us from the sentry towers as we recited the Pledge of Allegiance each day.
Protesters rally in NYC against Trump's travel ban

I was too young to understand the stinging irony of the words, "with liberty and justice for all."
I would still like Donald Trump to see "Allegiance." We filmed one of the performances and will screen it at more than 600 theaters on Feb. 19, the 75th anniversary of the executive order, signed by President Franklin Roosevelt, that began my family's forced relocation.
If President Trump would like a private viewing at the White House, we would be happy to accommodate his schedule. We would love for him to get a little education on this important chapter in history.
But it likely wouldn't change his mind.
Muslim brothers signed away their visas under Trump order: suit
During a press conference for "Celebrity Apprentice," I got him to agree on the record to meet me for lunch to discuss marriage equality. I fully expected him to demur, but he surprised me and accepted the invitation.

The day of our meeting, he rushed in and said very excitedly, "I went to a gay wedding, and it was beautiful. You gays have such great taste."
I asked why he didn't publicly support marriage equality, and he said that wasn't possible. He only believed in "traditional marriage," he said. Never mind his own track record and what he'd just said.
Trump can profess a principle and then go blatantly against it. He is ignorant, and because of his ignorance, he is fearful. Actually, the real terrorist is Donald Trump. He's the American terrorist.
2,000 Google employees protest Trump's travel ban
After a Trump surrogate recently cited the Japanese AMERICAN camps as a "precedent" for a possible Muslim registry, I heard a chilling echo from the 40s. On Jan. 10, I started a petition on Care2.com stating my support of Muslim people and opposing any policies that target them unfairly.
In just 21 days, it received more than 249,500 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon.
President Trump should take notice. He should resign before he is forced out or impeached. It's clear he cannot govern.
George Takei is an actor, author and activist. He famously portrayed Hikaru Sulu, the helmsman of the USS Enterprise, in the "Star Trek" TV series and six feature films.
The Handmade Toy Alliance, which has a section of its Web site titled “Countdown to Extinction,” sponsored a march on Washington last April and continues to buttonhole members of Congress. Still others have hired the Washington lobbying firm of Rudy Giuliani.
“The law is flawed,” said Rob Wilson, a director of the Handmade Toy Alliance, which wants Congress to reopen the 2008 legislation to new amendments. “It reflects decision-making that in a sane world makes no sense.”
“The law isn't making toys more safe, but is making everything more convoluted,” added Mr. Wilson, owner of Challenge and Fun, an Ashland, Mass., company that sells organic toys from Europe. “We're all losers, including the consumer.”
The law, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, was overwhelmingly passed by Congress in August 2008. For the first time, it set out mandatory safety standards for products used by children under the age of 12 and required toy manufacturers to test their products to prove that they were safe.

New regulations will not go into effect until February, but many of the big toy companies are not waiting — they are already testing toys in their labs, which have been certified by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or through third parties.
The government estimates that $22 billion worth of toys are imported each year, mainly from big toymakers with plants overseas.
Before this law was passed, testing of toys was not required, and compliance with safety standards was voluntary. But the furor over the sale and importation of toys containing lead and other toxic materials, which led to widespread toy recalls in 2007 and 2008, assured its passage.

Some major companies lobbied to shape it, including toy manufacturers, like Mattel, and Exxon Mobil, a maker of phthalates, substances used in many toys that are largely banned by the law.
The issue has put small toymakers at odds with consumer groups, which oppose any efforts to have Congress tinker with the new law out of fear that larger companies will try to gut its core provisions.
“This is landmark legislation,” said Nancy A. Cowles, executive director of Kids in Danger, a nonprofit that focused on safety in children's products that supported the measure.

“These groups are not above using the small crafters to reopen the legislation and get the changes they want.”
Ms. Cowles also said parents needed to be assured that their children's toys were safe, regardless of who made or sold them.
“From a product safety standpoint, it doesn't make a difference whether the toy comes from a local store or a national chain,” said Ms. Cowles. “A child doesn't know the difference and parents have the right to expect a safe product.”

The Consumer Product Safety Commission has said it wants to draft regulations that have enough flexibility to address the legitimate concerns of toy handicrafters while still upholding the new law.
“The commission is trying to find the right balance that would satisfy and address the needs to help businesses stay open and yet give parents more confidence that when they buy a product for their children, it's been tested and meets more stringent standards,” said Scott Wolfson, a commission spokesman.
Small toymakers and sellers are particularly irked by the fact that the new law allows large toy manufacturers, like Mattel, to conduct their product safety tests in their own labs, which must be certified by the federal government, while handicrafters would have to use third-party labs.

“They're the ones who got us into this mess, and they can do their testing on their own,” said Jill Chuckas, secretary of the Handmade Toy Alliance and owner of Crafty Baby in Stamford, Conn.
The commission is considering requiring testing of components used by toy handicrafters, rather than the final product itself. This testing would be done instead by component suppliers — for instance, button makers would have to certify that their products were lead-free.
That has won support from some small toymakers, who would be able to use only components that had passed these safety tests.
Thrift shops and used-toy stores have also joined the fight. Thrift stores say they have had to clear their stores of old toys and children's clothes out of concern that some items might not be safe. Children's books made before 1985, for example, contain lead in their ink.
“It's been devastating for us,” said Kitty Boyce, owner of the Kid's Closet in Rochester, Ill., who has emptied her shop of much of her children's merchandise and is selling adult items instead. “For us, there will be no bottom line this year.”
Adele R. Meyer, executive director of the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops, based in St. Clair Shores, Mich., said much of the new law made little sense. “People are taking away all items for children 12 and under,' she said.
“But how many 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds are going to be eating books?”
Call the Doctor! Nasa spots Dr Who's crack in the universe in the middle of the Milky Way
For followers of the current season of Dr Who, it is more than a little disconcerting.
For this thick black snake-like object in space bears an uncanny resemblance to the crack in the universe which has haunted Matt Smith and his companion, Karen Gillan.
Luckily for us, this striking image is the core of a thick, sooty cloud large enough to swallow dozens of solar systems. In fact, astronomers say its ‘belly' may be harbouring stars in the process of forming.
This infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows what astronomers are referring to as a 'snake'....
...but it bears an uncanny resemblance to the crack in space and time from this season of Dr Who
'The snake is an ideal place to hunt for massive forming stars as they have not had time to heat up and destroy the cloud they are born in,' said Dr. Sean Carey of NASA's Spitzer Science Center.
Spitzer was able to spot the sinuous cloud using its heat-seeking infrared vision. The object is hiding in the dusty plane of our Milky Way galaxy, invisible to optical telescopes.
Because its heat, or infrared light, can sneak through the dust, it first showed up in infrared images from past missions.
The cloud is so thick with dust that if you were to somehow transport yourself into the middle of it, you would see nothing but black, not even a star in the sky.
Spitzer's new view of the snake provides the best look at what lurks inside. The yellow and orange spots located on and around it are massive stars just beginning to take shape.
The bright red spot located on its belly is a monstrous stellar embryo, about 20 to 50 times the mass of our sun.
00:47 Why Wildfires Are Creating More Thunderstorms A freaky phenomenon is on the rise: wildfires are creating thunderstorms. Here's why that's a growing problem.
At a Glance With 35 confirmed deaths in Northern California, this has been the deadliest week of wildfires in state history.
Officials say roughly 5,700 homes and businesses have been destroyed and nearly 400 people are still missing.
At least 9,000 firefighters are working to control these blazes.
At least 35 people have died in what has been the deadliest week of wildfires in California history, and officials warned the toll could climb.
The scale of the disaster also became clearer Friday as authorities said the fires had chased an estimated 90,000 people from their homes and destroyed at least 5,700 homes and businesses, the Associated Press is reporting.
But a fifth day of desperate firefighting brought a glimmer of hope as crews battling the flames reported their first progress toward containing the massive blazes.

"The emergency is not over, and we continue to work at it, but we are seeing some great progress," said the state's emergency operations director, Mark Ghilarducci.
Over the past 24 hours, crews arrived from Nevada, Washington, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, North and South Carolina, Oregon and Arizona. Other teams came from as far away as Canada and Australia.
The Northern California infernos have killed more people than any single fire in state history, the AP reported. Officials originally cited the 1991 Oakland Hills fire as the deadliest single fire in California history, but it was actually the 1933 Griffith Park fire, which killed 29 people, that was the deadliest.
Officials searching were searching burned areas of Sonoma and Napa counties with cadaver dogs Thursday night when they recovered more bodies, said Sonoma County Sheriff Robert Giordano.
It's a forbidding process. In some cases, serial numbers on medical implants have been used to identify remains, the Associated Press reported.
"We have found bodies almost completely intact, and we have found bodies that were nothing more than ash and bones," Giordano said.
With hundreds of people still missing, Giordano said more victims are likely.
The Sonoma County Coroner's Office provided a list of the deceased whose next of kin have been notified:
Carol Collins-Swasey, 76, Santa Rosa
Lynne Anderson Powell, 72, Santa Rosa
Arthur Tasman Grant, 95, Santa Rosa
Suiko Grant, 75, Santa Rosa
Donna Mae Halbur, 80, Larkfield (Santa Rosa)

Carmen Caldentey Berriz, 75, Apple Valley
Michael John Dornbach, 57, Calistoga
Veronica Elizabeth McCombs, 67, Santa Rosa
Linda Tunis, 69, Santa Rosa
Christina Hanson, 27, Santa Rosa
In Santa Rosa, thousands of structures were destroyed, from mansions to middle-income homes to trailer parks.
"The fire did not discriminate ," Santa Rosa mayor Chris Coursey told the Los Angeles Times.
Several deadly wildfires were sparked at virtually the same time, most of which started in the region's wine country, on Sunday night. The counties of Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino, Yuba, Nevada, Butte and Orange have been affected.
The AP reported that some of the state's sites most popular with tourists, Sonoma and Calistoga in Napa Valley, were "ghost towns populated only by fire crews trying to stop the advancing infernos."

Nearly 400 people are still missing in Sonoma County as firefighters battle the 54-square-mile Tubbs fire. The blaze is just one of 17 wildfires burning through California, fueled by the return of strong winds. As of Friday morning, it was 25 percent contained , according to Cal Fire.
"Make no mistake, this is a serious, critical, catastrophic event," said Ken Pimlott, chief of the department.
The largest of the Northern California fires, the Atlas fire, is burning in Napa and Solano counties. It grew rapidly again overnight Thursday and has burned at least 75 square miles , Cal Fire said, but containment also grew from 3 percent Thursday to 27 percent Friday morning.
The series of fires is already among the worst in California history, and Pimlott says the situation is "going to continue to get worse before it gets better."
Firefighters can't expect much help from the weather, as conditions are expected to remain windy through the weekend, said weather.com meteorologist Linda Lam.
Crews have made little headway on the fires, which turned entire Northern California neighborhoods to ash and have left at least 180 people injured.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office has confirmed 18 fire-related deaths in the Tubbs fire. Officials in Mendocino County have confirmed eight deaths there in connection with the Redwood Complex of fires.
Three of the victims in Mendocino County have been identified , according to the San Francisco Chronicle: Kai Logan Shepherd, 14, Roy Howard Bowman, 87 and Irma Elsie Bowman, 88.

Four people have died in Yuba County in the Cascade fire, and two deaths were reported in Napa County, blamed on the Atlas fire. The two deaths in the Atlas fire were identified as Charles Rippey, 100, and his wife, Sara, 98 .
Early Friday morning, evacuations were advised, though not ordered, for areas west of Highway 29 between Oakville Grade and Rutherford Road in Napa County, the San Francisco Chronicle also reported.
The Sonoma Sheriff's Office expanded mandatory evacuation orders Thursday evening.
On Thursday morning, authorities strongly encouraged residents to evacuate from the north side of Sonoma and in most of Boyes Hot Springs.
Authorities also ordered all residents of Calistoga to evacuate Wednesday. Earlier, officials went through the town of 5,000 people, knocking on doors to warn about 2,000 of them to leave.

More than 9,000 firefighters and other personnel were battling the blazes and more resources were pouring in from Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Arizona.
"There was no wind, then there would be a rush of wind and it would stop," resident Ken Moholt-Siebert told the L.A. Times. "Then there would be another gust from a different direction. The flames wrapped around us. I was just being pelted with all this smoke and embers. It was just really fast."
The L.A. Times said entire blocks in the Fountaingrove area of Santa Rosa were leveled by the conflagration, and the city's new fire station, Fire Station 5, was destroyed. The fire also burned Santa Rosa's historic round barn, the city's K-mart, the Santa Rosa Hilton Sonoma Hotel and destroyed homes at the Journey's End Mobile Home Park.
"It's real bad," Cal Fire Battalion Chief Marshall Tuberville told the L.A. Times. "This is an example of nature in control, and we are doing what we can, but we're not being that effective at stopping the fire."
Authorities continue to investigate the cause of the fires but said it may be weeks before the origins are determined. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Janet Upton told the Associated Press downed power lines could to blame for starting some or all of these blazes, or they might have been sparked some other way.
Arrests follow Occupy Oakland demonstrations
By David Brown
4 November 2011
A one-day protest in Oakland, California on Wednesday that involved more than ten thousand people was followed by police action in the early morning hours of Thursday, including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets, followed by dozens of arrests.
The demonstrations on Wednesday involved the participation of many workers and youth outraged over earlier police actions that led to the near-fatal injury of one protester, Iraq war veteran Scott Olsen, who was struck in the head by a projectile. The protests were among the largest organized by the Occupy movement against inequality in the US.
The day became a semi-official event, however, endorsed by the Democratic Mayor Jean Quan, who had overseen the police violence in the first place. The protests were coordinated with the trade unions, and police presence was largely absent during the day.
Mayor Quan issued a statement on Wednesday saying: “We have spent the week collaborating with the Port, county, school district officials as well as clergy, business, community and activity groups to ensure that the day goes smoothly.”
Around 11 pm, however, protesters started occupying the abandoned former offices of Travelers Aid Society, a non-profit organization for the homeless that shut down due to budget cuts. The aim of the “occupation” was to turn the building into a community center.
In response the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, and encircled the plaza. By morning dozens of protesters were arrested and at least three were hospitalized.
Since the beginning of the port occupation there had been signs that the police were hoping for a provocation later. After dark a police helicopter had started circling the port shining its spotlight on protesters in the street. Since the street was already well lit with lampposts, this served no purpose other than keeping tensions high.
The actions of a few individuals who broke windows and engaged in vandalism were used as a pretext for police action. As is always the case with such actions, the operations of police provocateurs is likely. According to one eyewitness who spoke to the World Socialist Web Site, some people on the protester side of the barricades responded to the initial police advance in “bizarre and erratic ways.” Most notably one man “appeared sort of out of nowhere” and “broke the windows of some local businesses and tossed trash cans at the police.”
That was far more excuse than the police felt they needed to redouble their use of tear gas and rubber bullets. According to a city press release that afternoon, over 80 people were arrested.
There have now been more than three thousand arrests since the Occupy movement began in September. Elsewhere in the US on Wednesday, protesters in Rochester and Seattle were arrested by police under the Democratic mayors of those cities. Police in Rochester, New York arrested 16 protesters on Wednesday and over 50 since last Friday.
In Seattle under Democratic Mayor Michael McGinn, at least three people protesting the CEO of JPMorgan Chase at a Sheraton Hotel where he was a keynote speaker were arrested, and six people were arrested earlier that day outside a Chase Bank. In both cases, the police made heavy use of pepper spray on large groups of protesters.
Meanwhile, the occupation of the port in Oakland ended calmly Thursday morning when a local president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Richard Mead, invited the last protesters to breakfast and the morning shift started work.
The march on the port and its “shutdown” was agreed upon beforehand by the union bureaucracy and Democrats as a safe way for protesters to vent their anger without raising any of the deeper political questions surrounding the police violence.
Together with organizers who support the occupy movement's “no politics” approach, the unions sought to engender a carnival like atmosphere to the exclusion of any political discussion. Although many people brought amplifiers and speakers to the port, they were used for music. Notably absent from the rally was any central area to speak about the issues facing workers and discuss the political issues raised by the occupy movement.
None of the unions called an actual strike on Wednesday. However several, most notably the Service Employees International Union and the Oakland Education Association, encouraged their members to take personal days and join the rally with manager approval. Officials from these unions were involved in the organizational meetings to plan the event. Quan also invited city workers to take furlough days.
Absent from every unions' solidarity statement was any mention of the Democrats or the role they are playing in cutting social services and supporting the rich. Typical were the statements of George Gresham, president of SEIU 1199, the union's biggest local, and Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, who told the Washington Post that they expected the Occupy Movement to support Obama in the next elections.
New Jersey officials are considering taking a $2.25 billion "bridge loan" from JP Morgan to close the state's cash shortfall, the Wall Street Journal reports.
The unconventional move would make New Jersey the first state to tap a major commercial bank loan to cover its bills for the first few weeks of the new fiscal year (which begins July 1st). Typically, states start a new year with enough cash on hand to tide them over until they can arrange a late summer bond offering based on the new budget.
The credit line hasn't been finalized but is designed to give New Jersey enough cash on hand while it prepares for a bond offering, a process that can take up to two months.
The interest rate is "relatively low" but could go as high as 9% if the state doesn't pay the bank back in six months, a person familiar with the talks told the WSJ.
The state would repay the bridge loan with proceeds from the bonds. The bonds are expected to be paid off with tax revenues.
Tyler Durden at Zerohedge points out that New Jersey's loan would likely be used as a benchmark for other cash-strapped states, defining key loan terms like subordination, collateralization and interest rates. If the deal closes successfully, expect more states to get on board with this new short-term budget fix.
SGX sealing is vulnerable to rollback attacks as the enclave is not able to tell if the sealed data is the latest or a old copy. To mitigate this attack, monotonic counter (MC) has been introduced in Intel SGX SDK 1.8. This post looks into some implementation details inside Intel SGX SDK.
1. sgx_create_monotonic_counter[1]
Look at the description of this API, two things show up – first, the counter creation involves non-volatile memory (NVM) writing; second, limited number of MCs can be created per enclave due to the quota. Apparently, unlike the older version of Intel SGX SDK, where MC was only available in the simulation mode, the MC here is based on real NVM, which also seems to have limited capacity. Let's go deeper.
2. PSE (Platform Service/Security Enclave?)
The MC creation essentially calls sgx_create_monotonic_counter_ex[2] inside SDK. This function builds two pse_message_t messages for the request and reply, which are both passed to crypt_invoke. The crypt_invoke function establishes a PSE session (secure and authenticated channel) with aesmd, encrypts the request using the shared secret, and calls uae_invoke_service with both the request and reply passed, which eventually calls invoke_service_ocall[3] in the PSE provided by PSW other than the SDK.
3. OAL (OS Abstraction Layer?)
The PSE request and reply are then delivered to oal_invoke_service[4], which essentially transforms the PSE messages into AEInvokeServiceRequest and AEInvokeServiceResponse, and sends the AE messages to aesmd via UNIX socket ‘/var/run/aesmd/aesm.socket'. This MC creation request will then be handled by PSE_MC_SERVICE as a PSE_MC_CREATE command[1]
4. PSE_OP (PSE OPeration?)
The service handler table defined in pse_op.cpp[5] lists all the MC related command PSE_MC_SERVICE supports:
static const struct service_handler_t { uint16_t service_id; uint16_t service_cmd; uint16_t req_size; uint16_t resp_size; srv_pfn_t srv_pfn; } service_handler[] = { {PSE_MC_SERVICE, PSE_MC_CREATE, sizeof(pse_mc_create_req_t), sizeof(pse_mc_create_resp_t), pse_mc_create}, {PSE_MC_SERVICE, PSE_MC_READ, sizeof(pse_mc_read_req_t), sizeof(pse_mc_read_resp_t), pse_mc_read }, {PSE_MC_SERVICE, PSE_MC_INC, sizeof(pse_mc_inc_req_t), sizeof(pse_mc_inc_resp_t), pse_mc_inc }, {PSE_MC_SERVICE, PSE_MC_DEL, sizeof(pse_mc_del_req_t), sizeof(pse_mc_del_resp_t), pse_mc_del }, {PSE_TRUSTED_TIME_SERVICE, PSE_TIMER_READ, sizeof(pse_timer_read_req_t), sizeof(pse_timer_read_resp_t), pse_read_timer}, };
And pse_mc_create is our target handler.
5. VMC (Virtual Monotonic Counter?)
Now we are into create_vmc[6], described as “create a VMC in SQLite Database and return UUID of the VMC to the caller”. Huh, so the MC is essentially an entry in a SQLite DB. So how could a SQLite DB defend against rollback attacks given that it is just a normal file on the disk? Hang on. Let's continue. When this is the first MC creation request ever happend, we need to create the VMC DB first, via initialize_sqlite_database_file[7]. This very first thing it does is to call read_rpdata[8]. As its file name implies, the SQLite DB accesses hardware (NV) to get the hash of the DB at certain epoch, which is essentailly a HW MC. We are getting close to the real HW…
6. PSDA_Service[9]
This file contains all functions used by the VMC SQLite DB to create/delete/update HW MC in the so-far-unknown HW via invoke_psda_service. An ephemeral session is established in the function to provide secure and authenticated communication with the mystery HW, through psda_invoke_service_ocall[10], and eventually psda_invoke_service[11].
7. Intel ME
Just looking at the psda_invoke_service is really insightful:
JVM_COMM_BUFFER commBuf; commBuf.TxBuf->buffer = psda_req_msg; commBuf.TxBuf->length = psda_req_msg_size; commBuf.RxBuf->buffer = psda_resp_msg; commBuf.RxBuf->length = psda_resp_msg_size; int response_code; ae_error_t ret; PROFILE_START("JHI_SendAndRecv2"); ret = PSDAService::instance().send_and_recv( PSDA_COMMAND_SERVICE, &commBuf, &response_code, NO_RETRY_ON_SESSION_LOSS); PROFILE_END("JHI_SendAndRecv2");
JVM? JHI? Finally, we have reached the dark side of the MC. Somehow some Java shit involves in communicating with the secret HW[13] — Yes, it is Intel ME! JHI stands for Java Host Interface, which is used to install Java applets into Dynamic Application Loader (DAL) firmware (inside ME) and communicate with them[12]. Yes, the SGX MC is essentially implemented in ME as a Java applet called “PSDA”!
8. PSDA.dalp
PSDAService::install_psda[14] installs the psda applet into ME using JHI. Not surprisingly, the source code for psda is not available. Instead, the download_prebuilt.sh script is used to download the applet binary directly, since it needs to signed by Intel — Right! Intel does not want anyone to install any applet into ME, for security reasons!!! After running the download script, PSDA.dalp will appear under psw/ae/data/prebuilt. It is encoded as Base64:
Copying out the Base64 encoded applet and running decoding, we have a chance to peek into the implementation of the applet:

9. Intel ME Again
Although we only looked at the MC creation in SGX, this post has been long enough. Last thing about SGX MC is still about Intel ME. If you have seen dmesg like “Device doesn't have valid ME Interface”, and neither /dev/mei nor /dev/mei0 is created, it is very likely that you are running a server platform with a different ME firmware (SPS) comparing to desktops/laptops[15], and the corresponding DAL firmware is not available in SPS. This means SGX MC is NOT available for servers!!! Well, I guess this does not really matter as people are in a rush to disable ME anyway… On the other hand, implementing SGX MC using ME seems to be the most reasonable choice (at least, we are still inside the CPU package), although this makes “SGX defends against ME attacks” statement in vain.

Story highlights Democrats claim comments by the House Republican prove the Benghazi investigation committee is "a political campaign against Hillary Clinton"
Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democratic member of the committee, said McCarthy's comments "laid bare the abusive purpose of this taxpayer funded committee"
McCarthy told CNN's Jake Tapper that Clinton's poll numbers have dropped because of their work on the committee.
Washington (CNN) Democrats are citing comments House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made Tuesday as proof that the House committee investigating the Benghazi terrorist attack is nothing more than "a political campaign against Hillary Clinton."
Speaking with Fox News, the California Republican described the effects of the Benghazi Select Committee -- a group meant to look into the deaths of four Americans in 2012.
"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee. A select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known that any of that had happened had we not fought to make that happen," McCarthy said.
Democrats were quick to highlight and attack the comments by McCarthy, who is the front-runner to become the next speaker of the House. Democrats said his remarks confirm what they have long alleged about the committee: that it's aimed at making Clinton's 2016 presidential run more difficult.
"This stunning concession from Rep. McCarthy reveals the truth that Republicans never dared admit in public: the core Republican goal in establishing the Benghazi Committee was always to damage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and never to conduct an even-handed search for the facts," Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the committee's top Democrat, said Wednesday.

A would-be UK bomber and his wife have been found guilty by the Old Bailey court of plotting to carry out an explosion in London to mark the tenth anniversary of the 2005 suicide attacks that took place in the same city. Both have been sentenced to life imprisonment: a minimum of 27 years for Mohammed Rehman, and a minimum of 25 years for his ex-wife Sana Ahmed Khan.
A report by The Guardian explains the case: "Mohammed Rehman, 25, who secretly wed Sana Ahmed Khan, 24, intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 atrocities with blasts that would have inflicted mass casualties in either Westfield shopping centre, west London, or the London Underground."
Remarkably, Rehman took to Twitter to ask for advice on which of those two targets he should choose: "Westfield shopping centre or London underground?" Rehman asked. "Any advice would be appreciated greatly." The post carried a link to an al-Qaida press release about the 2005 London bombings. Sky News reports that Rehman's Twitter name was "Silent Bomber," with the handle @InService2Godd. As if that weren't enough, his Twitter bio read: "Learn how to make powerful explosives from the comfort of ones' bedroom." The Twitter account has since been suspended.
Sky News says Rehman was also openly searching for information about the London bombings and information on how to make bombs: "The same day [as his tweet asking for target suggestions], he trawled YouTube for London bombings and Shehzad Tanweer—one of the 7/7 bombers who he referred to as his 'beloved predecessor.' As well as buying bomb making equipment Rehman searched online for instructions to make explosives and researched violent and extreme Islamic ideology."
Curiously, Rehman seems to have expended no effort to hide his online searches for information about how to create explosives, or his plans to carry out an attack. It doesn't appear that Rehman or his wife used encryption to hide their preparations from prying eyes.
Information about this latest (failed) terrorist bombing undermines further the repeated claim that the world is "going dark" for the intelligence agencies, and that strong encryption poses a threat to society. Once again, all the information that the security services needed to stop the plot was publicly available; fortunately, in this case it was spotted and acted upon.
The Guardian's coverage reveals another interesting aspect: "The plot was one of seven that David Cameron has been briefed about by security officials as being inspired by Isis and foiled in the last year or so. The prime minister referenced the multiple attempts linked to Isis to cause mass casualty attacks as part of his justification for military action against targets in Syria."
So we now know that at least one of those seven "plots" was conducted not by a well-organised and ruthless band of terrorists, but by a lone, bumbling idiot. Perhaps some of the other six plots were similarly unimpressive, which raises the question: is the threat to UK society really so great that we must give up fundamental freedoms by allowing the UK government to bring in extreme legislation like the Snooper's Charter?

Ronald Reagan once said, “No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this Earth.”
Reagan said that in 1964. The underlying point still holds true some 53 years later.
But there's more. Not only do government programs and bureaucracies seemingly achieve eternal life, but they grow bigger with failure. Failure in the private sector means trying something different or going out of business. Failure in government usually leads to bigger budgets, more staff and an expanded reach. Just think about public schools and LBJ's “War on Poverty” programs.
That's why it's so critical to kill costly and misguided ideas for bigger, more intrusive and controlling government before they ever become reality. Consider the current challenges in trying to roll back two massive expansions of government imposed during President Barack Obama's presidency – ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank.
ObamaCare inflicted a host of mandates, regulations, and taxes. Predictably, health insurance and related costs have increased and continue to skyrocket for taxpayers, businesses, individuals who have lost their insurance, those facing fewer choices in the government-run exchanges, and those who do not receive government subsidies, as noted in a new Bloomberg report. Republicans railed and ran against the many ills of ObamaCare since it was signed into law in 2010. Yet, during the first year of Republicans controlling the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House, the effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare has stalled. That, in part, has been due to an ObamaCare constituency protecting its turf.
Indeed, another reason to oppose new government undertakings is that each creates groups that benefit from or become dependent on such endeavors, and therefore possess strong incentives to protect and expand those benefits no matter how costly or destructive they might be.
And then there's the Dodd-Frank financial regulation legislation, also signed into law in 2010. As a knee-jerk reaction to the credit mess of 2008-09, Dodd-Frank failed to deal with actual causes of the meltdown. For example, nothing was done to stop the federal government from pushing a dubious “affordable housing” agenda through, for example, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Community Reinvestment Act, passed by Congress in 1977 and revised in the 1990s. In summary, federal lawmakers for decades pushed a political agenda that de-coupled swathes of mortgage lending from economic reality. That very much continues today.
Dodd-Frank actually doubled down on misguided government intervention and regulation. As noted by Hester Pierce in a report titled Revisiting Dodd-Frank published early this year by the Mercatus Institute at George Mason University, “Rather than addressing the regulatory failures that led to the crisis, Dodd-Frank's core solution was to shift decision-making from the private sector to regulators—the same regulators whose lapses had contributed to the crisis. Dodd-Frank has been costly in the short term, as any major regulatory overhaul would be. The financial industry and regulators have poured countless hours and dollars into implementing the new law. Of greater concern than these short-term implementation costs are Dodd-Frank's potential long-run costs. Rather than averting crises, Dodd-Frank's rejiggering of the financial system has created the preconditions for a future crisis, while inhibiting economic growth and dynamism.”
On that last point, Pierce highlights the machinations of how this regulatory monstrosity has and will continue to undercut innovation and growth. She wrote, “The law calls on regulators to step in where the rest of us—individuals, firms, and nongovernmental institutions—are supposedly destined to fail, namely, to identify and address all systemic and a wide array of nonsystemic risks… Financial regulators thus become central planners charged with carefully balancing the interests and risk-taking of all market participants, ensuring that firms do not fail, keeping the financial system functioning smoothly, and managing firms' relationships with one another. This form of regulation turns regulators into allocators of credit: regulators decide who gets financed and who does not, which, in turn, affects how the economy develops, which consumer and business needs are met, and where innovation occurs.”
The contents of the first report on the U.S. financial system from the Mnuchin Treasury Department, published in June, echoed and expanded upon these points. It was noted, “The length of Dodd-Frank fails to respectfully its expansive scope as the legislation delegated unprecedented authority to financial regulators and mandated hundreds of new regulations. In total, implementing Dodd-Frank required approximately 390 regulations, implemented by more than a dozen different regulatory agencies. Dodd-Frank failed to address many drivers of the financial crisis, while adding new regulatory burdens.”
Among the results pointed out in the Treasury report were “a slow rate of bank asset and loan growth,” with small business lending being “one of the most anemic sectors, barely recovering to 2008 levels” while “origination rates for large business loans are at record levels.”
Another Mercatus analysis highlighted that Dodd-Frank is “associated with more than five times as many new restrictions as any other law passed since January 2009, for a total of nearly 28,000 new restrictions. In fact, it is associated with more new restrictions than all other laws passed during the Obama administration put together…” And that's saying something.
In addition, regulations targeted at so-called big businesses – in this case, “big banks” who always seem to be targets of both Progressives and populists – usually wind up hitting small enterprises hard. That has been the case with Dodd-Frank. As pointed out in the Mnuchin report, “[R]egulation has proven to be insufficiently tailored to depository institutions based on the size and complexity of their business models. Requirements in Dodd-Frank are overseen by multiple regulatory agencies with shared or joint rule-making responsibilities and overlapping mandates. This complicated oversight structure has raised the cost of compliance for the depository sector, particularly for mid-sized and community financial institutions.”
For good measure, more regulation raises obstacles to new entry into the regulated industry. It's no different in the bank business. A March 2015 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond noted that the number of community banks from 2007 to 2013 declined by 14 percent, and this falloff was not just about community bank failures, but “an unprecedented collapse in new bank entry.” It was noted: “This collapse in new bank entry has no precedent during the past 50 years, and it could have significant economic repercussions. In particular, the decline in new bank entry disproportionately decreases the number of community banks because most new banks start small. Since small banks have a comparative advantage in lending to small businesses, their declining number could affect the allocation of credit to different sectors in the economy.”
Central planning via hyper-regulation never works. Regulations limiting new bank entry, and hitting small and regional banks hard wind up restraining small business growth, new business creation and innovation.
As for actions by this Republican White House and Congress, the effort to roll back Dodd-Frank is under way. The U.S. House of Representatives has led the way. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (HR 10), which would repeal significant chunks of Dodd-Frank, passed the House by a vote of 233-186 in early June. Senate action on such a sweeping measure, however, is a question mark, providing another reminder of the difficulties of undoing big policy mistakes that expand big government.
One smaller measure worth taking note of is the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017, which has sponsors from both sides of the political aisle – Democrat Claire McCaskill in the Senate and Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer in the House, both from Missouri. It's an effort to lift some of Dodd-Frank's most onerous regulations from the backs of smaller regional banks.
As Daniel Press from the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written, the bill “directs the Federal Reserve to look at interconnectedness, cross-border activities, and complexity when assessing their regulatory requirements, not just size. Currently, the $50 billion limit is an arbitrary designation that subjects medium-sized regional banks, which range somewhere between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, to the same standards as large, multi-trillion dollar banks. This change makes sense, as regional banks that predominately take deposits and have little exposure to derivatives or trading are clearly not ‘systemically important' as defined by Dodd-Frank.”
Will this bite of bipartisan regulatory restraint and common sense prevail? It clearly should serve as an opening legislative accomplishment in a much-needed rollback of financial over-regulation. However, the defenders of central planning via regulation, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), stand opposed. Warren continues to peddle the idea that the 2008 crisis was about not enough government regulation, as opposed to government policies pushing resource allocation in the housing/mortgage market according to political preferences rather than sound economics.
The struggle of denying eternal life to government programs and bureaus continues more than a half-century after Ronald Reagan so prominently drew national attention to this daunting and destructive challenge.
West Virginia landed a major piece at a position of need Thursday when former Iowa cornerback Maurice Fleming committed to the Mountaineers.
Fleming saw action in 14 games for Iowa last season recording 17 tackles but elected to spend his final season elsewhere as a graduate transfer. West Virginia became a school that was seriously involved in his recruitment and he took a trip to Morgantown this week to see the campus and meet with the coaching staff.
"Thanks To All The Schools And Their Recruitment But I Will Be Playing @ West Virginia University For My Final Season! Let's Go ‪#Mountaineers‬"
He will have one year of eligibility remaining and as a graduate transfer will be eligible immediately this fall. Fleming will step into a cornerback battle that is wide open and will have opportunity to compete for a starting role this fall.
West Virginia was not the only school involved as several programs moved into the mix for Fleming including Louisiana Tech but he settled on the Mountaineers.
WVSports.com also has provided a detailed breakdown of what this news means to the football program and how Fleming will fit in with the Mountaineers.

SCP-2645
Item #: SCP-2645
Object Class: Euclid
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2645 is to be contained within a standard Euclid containment chamber. As of Incident-2645-2, the lighting in SCP-2645's chamber has been connected to a backup generator. Additional changes include the installation of a light tube system to provide a minimum level of natural light without compromising containment, and motion sensors to detect any unexpected activity.
Description: SCP-2645 is a full-size mirror with a frame decorated with painted wooden carvings of birds, flowers and lily-pads. Any object that would come into contact with SCP-2645's surface does not touch glass, but in fact encounters an exact duplicate of itself projected from an unknown location. For example, an individual attempting to touch the surface of SCP-2645 would instead feel an exact replica of their own hand. It has therefore proven impossible to make any conclusions as to the material of the surface of SCP-2645.
Substances in gaseous form are able to pass through the surface of SCP-2645. When this occurs, SCP-2645 produces and expels these substances in equal measure to that which passes through, in a manner that allows an accurate reflection to be maintained.
Researchers' current hypothesis is that SCP-2645 is some form of extra-dimensional window or opening that mimics the properties of a mirror. Since gases are able to pass through SCP-2645, it is evident that this mimicry is not completely accurate, at least at an atomic level. Further experiments to test SCP-2645's effect on phenomena without physical substance such as light, sound, and heat have been scheduled.
Addendum: Incident 2645-1 and related Experiment Log
Experiment 2645-4C:
A thermocouple was placed in front of SCP-2645. Test subject D-5461 was given a propane-operated flamethrower and, whilst standing one meter from SCP-2645, instructed to fire the weapon at the center of the glass. Security staff with fire extinguishers were positioned at the sides of the room, having been instructed to remain clear of the mirror throughout the experiment, whilst Dr Cox observed via camera.
The jet of flame produced was able to pass through SCP-2645 and another jet of flame was emitted from its surface. The flames emitted appeared identical to those seen in the reflection. However, the temperature of the flame emitted by SCP-2645 was far lower than anticipated. D-5461 quickly moved to security staff after her clothes ignited, and as a result suffered mainly superficial injuries.
Analysis of footage revealed that the measurement appearing on the reflected version of the thermocouple was at the expected temperature, not matching its counterpart in reality.
Incident Log 2645-1
On 25/10/████, SCP-2645 was scheduled to be moved to Chamber A12. However, whilst transporting SCP-2645, personnel found that charred human remains could be seen in SCP-2645's reflection close to the Eastern wall of the chamber. Due to the nature and position of the remains, a link was drawn to Experiment 2645-4C.
SCP-2645 was returned to its original position and Dr Cox informed about the discovery. Dr Cox was granted permission to resume testing with D-5461. It was noted that no reflection of D-5461 could be seen in SCP-2645.
D-5461 was instructed to touch SCP-2645, but did not come into contact with any obstruction, her hand instead passing through the mirror's surface. Ignoring orders, D-5461 stepped through SCP-2645. Security Personnel were ordered to terminate D-5461 in response, but bullets fired at SCP-2645 were impeded by their reflections.
Dr Cox began to seal SCP-2645's containment chamber, under the assumption that the same would occur within SCP-2645's reflection. However, D-5461 reached the reflection of Dr Cox before this task was completed, tackling him to the ground. This had no noticeable effect on the real Dr Cox.
The reflection of Security Officer Williams then ceased firing and turned to train her rifle on D-5461, who had almost left the chamber at this point. As a result Security Officer Williams' bullets were now able to pass through SCP-2645, impacting with the walls and door of the chamber. The reflection of Security Officer Jenks was struck in the right shoulder, causing him to stagger and drop his rifle, which allowed further projectiles to pass through SCP-2645. At this point, Security Personnel were ordered to hold their fire.
The reflection of Security Officer Williams returned to normal, snapping into position unnaturally quickly. The reflections of Dr Cox and Security Officer Jenks performed a similar action. However, whilst both now mimicked the actions of their counterparts very closely, the former appeared disheveled and the latter was nursing his arm. Dr Cox was positioned slightly incorrectly and neither's facial expressions quite matched those of their doubles.
Moments later, the surface of SCP-2645 took on the appearance and properties of iron. It remained in this state for approximately ten minutes, before returning to its original form. There was no visible evidence of the incident having occurred. However, Security Officer Jenks' reflection was no longer identical to him, instead showing an unknown person with similar build and facial features.
Four weeks later, SCP-2645 resumed normal behaviour with zero discrepancies.
Addendum: Incident 2645-2
Due to a containment breach of SCP-███, Site-███ experienced a power failure. This led to the failure of the lights in SCP-2645's chamber for a total of three hours. After power was restored, D-5461's burnt remains were found positioned by the Eastern wall of the chamber. The reflection of the corpse could still be seen in SCP-2645 and was accurate to the position and appearance of its version in reality. Personnel reported a strong smell of cooked meat.
Due to the conditions of the incident, video footage was unusable. Audio recorded a prolonged scream, followed by unintelligible whispering lasting approximately three minutes.
Following this incident, SCP-2645's containment procedures were updated to their current state.

J (Japanese: Ｊ J), frequently referred to as Pokémon Hunter J, is a recurring character who appeared in the Pokémon anime. She is a Pokémon hunter who, with the help of her henchmen, captures and steals Pokémon and sells them as requested by her clients for a profit on the black market. She first appeared in Mutiny in the Bounty!.
History
J in her debut
Prior to the events of the Diamond & Pearl series, J became a Pokémon hunter, and she stole a Ninetales, Kirlia, Magby, Swampert, Teddiursa, and Relicanth and sold them to her clients. She was rewarded a large amount of money. Since then, she was wanted by the Officer Jennys in Sinnoh.
J made her official debut in Mutiny in the Bounty! where she rode on her Salamence to Melodi's flower garden, where she planned to steal Melodi's Gardevoir. Despite Gardevoir attempting to escape with Teleport, J found it using her goggles and hit it with a special beam from a device on her arm that turned it into stone. J then made her exit with Melodi's Gardevoir, and Ash chased after her, demanding that she return Gardevoir to Melodi, but then J went after Ash's Pikachu since she thought Pikachu would be worth a sizable amount of money. J had her Drapion battle Ash's Pikachu in an attempt to see his moves. After Pikachu used Volt Tackle, J used her Ariados to bind Ash to a rock and then proceeded to steal Pikachu without any trouble.
After Team Rocket dealt with her henchmen, J encountered them next. As with her encounter with Ash, she bound the trio to a rock. She turned Meowth into stone for the same reason as Ash's Pikachu. J was then seen by a waterwheel, stealing an Absol. Before the other officers arrived as backup, Ash immediately confronted J, where the Pokémon Hunter took on Officer Jenny's Arcanine with Salamence and won. J immediately went to her airship with Ash, Jessie and James, who called a truce with each other to rescue their Pokémon. Following a brief confrontation with J, they managed to sneak into her airborne base and rescue their Pokémon and all the others she had stolen, before returning them to their rightful Trainers. Though several of her henchmen had been captured by Officer Jenny, J remained at large.
J's appearance in the anime
J reappeared in Ill-Will Hunting!, where she was on a mission to steal a group of Shieldon. She was seen contacting her henchmen and client about the Shieldon. J eventually found the Shieldon with Ash, his friends, and Gary. Ash and Gary had a Double Battle with her, while Dawn and Brock led the Shieldon to safety. However, one of the Shieldon fell, and J turned it to stone in order to steal it. J attempted to give the petrified Shieldon to her client, but Ash and Gary attacked the airbase which prevented her from doing so. Her client cut off the deal to obtain the Shieldon, since Officer Jenny was near. After telling Ash and his friends not to get in her way next time, she told her second-in-command to establish radio contact with their employer, in order to tell him that they would not be doing service with him again.
In Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! (Part 1), J was given the assignment to steal a special Riolu for her client. One of her henchmen informed J about their encounter with Kellyn, Ash, Dawn, and Brock. Later, J found the group by a lake. After Ash and Riolu separated from the group, J went to a forest. She then proceeded to burn the forest using her Salamence's Flamethrower.
J continued to do so in Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! (Part 2). She was able to capture the Riolu, but Ash followed her onto the airship. J soon became aware of Ash's arrival and ordered Drapion to grab him as soon as he confronted her. Although Ash escaped from Drapion's grasp, J quickly ejected him from her ship. J then met up with her client and gave him the special Riolu. She left after receiving payment from him, but the Riolu was later rescued from the client, who was then arrested.
Sometime before Pillars of Friendship!, J was given a request from one of her clients to catch a Regigigas and traveled to the Snowpoint Temple. After Brandon heard the news about the situation in the Snowpoint Temple, J had her henchmen work to prevent the Battle Pyramid from getting closer. Even though he and the group were able to narrowly defeat the henchmen's Pokémon, J already had her Salamence destroy the pillars guarding Regigigas. Despite Brandon and Maria warning J about not waking up Regigigas, she destroyed the last pillar, forcing Regigigas to awaken. When Regigigas began to rampage, J was able to leave the Snowpoint Temple. She watched as Brandon used his Pokémon to calm Regigigas and then bound the group with Ariados's String Shot. J went after the Legendary titans during their rampage. She attempted to turn Regigigas to stone but Brandon and his Pokémon jumped in the way to prevent it from happening. Regigigas destroyed J's bracelet and withdrew from the area when her client decided to cancel the deal.
J's glasses shown outside the sinking ship
J appeared again in Unlocking the Red Chain of Events!, where she was hired by Team Galactic to catch Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. In The Needs of the Three!, she proceeded to carry out the task of capturing them. Gary attempted to stop her from doing so with his Umbreon and Electivire, but Saturn's Toxicroak overpowered the two. J then dropped a Galactic Bomb into Lake Valor to force Azelf into the open. With the help of Team Galactic's Golbat, J was able to catch Azelf. This caused Uxie and Mesprit to appear. although Uxie and Mesprit putting up a good fight and dodging attacks from Mars's Purugly and Jupiter's Skuntank, J captured the two of them as well.
Although she did succeed in capturing the Lake guardians, her ship was hit by two Future Sight attacks used by Uxie and Mesprit directly before she captured them, which, in her overconfidence, she had forgotten. As a result, her ship crashed into Lake Valor and was sucked into a whirlpool while she and her crew members were still on board. Once the ship was underwater, the protective glass broke and the ship was flooded, causing it to explode. It is currently unknown if J, her Pokémon, or any of her crew survived.
She appeared briefly in Memories are Made of Bliss! in Team Rocket's fantasy riding her Salamence.
Character
J and Ash
J is ruthless, relentless, and cruel, willing to do anything to capture Pokémon for her clients, up to and including injuring innocent people or Pokémon. In her debut episode, she chose to drop some of her henchmen to their potential deaths without hesitation or remorse, emphasizing her intensely independent, sociopathic, greedy and callous nature. She has no honor, decency or regard for any form of life - the only thing that matters to her is money. She is one of the very few characters (including the Iron-Masked Marauder, Dr. Yung, Grings Kodai, and Alva) in the anime who is purely evil.
J is also highly pragmatic. She is reluctant to harm Pokémon that she is trying to capture - as they would be less valuable to her clients - and she will forgo direct combat in favor of sneak attacks and mass destruction if the opportunity presents itself. This contributes to her high threat level in the series. However, she also tends to underestimate her opponents when on the verge of victory, which often leads to her defeat and ultimately ensures her (seemingly) final downfall.
Out of all of the characters that encountered her, she has a dislike for Ash the most as evidenced when he kept on interfering with her job and the fact that most of the encounters had Ash nearly killed or severely injured had it not been for the unlikely intervention of his friends and Pokémon, and other characters supporting the protagonists.

Gadgets
J has what looks like some sort of cannon attached to her arm that is able to turn Pokémon and humans into stone. The effects are permanent unless Pokémon are placed in a special case or revived with Hidden Power. In Pillars of Friendship , it was destroyed when Regigigas reflected her Salamence's Dragon Pulse back at her. The device had been repaired or replaced by the time the events of The Needs of the Three! took place.
, it was destroyed when Regigigas reflected her Salamence's Dragon Pulse back at her. The device had been repaired or replaced by the time the events of took place. She also has cases for those Pokémon turned to stone which can adjust how much the body is covered with stone.
Her goggles also have many abilities, like detecting heat and camouflaged or transformed Pokémon.
Transportation
She has six-wheeled vans driven by her henchmen that can shoot out nets and have retractable arms.
She travels throughout the Pokémon world in an airship. This ship is equipped with a stealth cloaking device that can render the ship invisible which helps in deterring pursuers, mounting surprise attacks, and making her business dealings more private and less vulnerable to outside interference. It is also capable of firing lasers from its front and has a bottom-mounted cannon that shoots a gum-like substance for restraining and capturing Pokémon.

For many women who chose to watch President Trump's joint press conference with Angela Merkel on Friday, the experience hit far too close to home. Not only did Trump's body language mirror his movements on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton (when will that memory go away?) it reminded them of their own personal interactions with powerful men who seemed to resent their presence.
If you haven't watched the full conference, please don't. Watch this very brief clip instead, where Chancellor Merkel asks Trump for a handshake, only to have it be rejected. It's not just that Trump refuses to shake her hand. He doesn't even look her in the eye.
Photographers: Can we get a handshake?
Merkel (to Trump): Do you want to have a handshake?
Trump: *no response*
Merkel: *makes awkward face* pic.twitter.com/ehgpCnWPg7 — David Mack (@davidmackau) March 17, 2017
Prominent feminists, comedians and women on Twitter struggled to watch this insulting viral moment. It wasn't easy watching one of the most powerful women in the world — and a prominent American ally — get ignored, regardless of you think of his actual handshakes.
I think a lot of women will find Trump refusing to even look at Merkel during that presser pretty familiar — Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) March 17, 2017
There have been so many times I've been introduced to men who won't look me in the eye, or talk as if I'm not there. — Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) March 17, 2017
Trump probably didn't count on the presidency forcing him to spend time with so many women over the age of 35. — 💀Maggie Serota 💀 (@maggieserota) March 17, 2017
Trump's body language n scowl while #Merkel speaks. Rarely even looks her in eyes. His disrespect for women is clear.
Unless shes a 10.
Ass — Claudia (@theClaudiaInez) March 17, 2017
Of course Trump wouldn't shake hands with Merkel. He's afraid if he makes contact with an intelligent woman he might catch human decency. — beth loves cake,so (@bourgeoisalien) March 17, 2017
The body language differences are just so striking. https://t.co/GDnCMmdS6H — ...she persisted. 🗽 (@leahmcelrath) March 17, 2017
Trump's refusal to look Angela Merkel in the eye or to shake her hand belies his abject disrespect for all women. Today we are all Angela. pic.twitter.com/0vlXIBuSFP — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) March 17, 2017
It's clear that women have been in this position before: sitting or standing there awkwardly, while powerful men refuse to acknowledge their presence.
Remember this sad viral moment?
Election 2016 has *officially* ended, but its awkward body language lives on.
Boat captain watches as sharks kill diver
Updated
The skipper of an abalone fishing boat watched in horror as one of his divers was taken by two great white sharks off South Australia's Eyre Peninsula late yesterday.
The search is resuming for the body of the man, who was taken out to sea by the sharks after being attacked as he returned to the boat.
The attack happened near Coffin Bay at the foot of the Eyre Peninsula, south of Perforated Island.
Police say the boat's skipper is suffering from "significant shock" and had been unable to give many details about the attack.
This morning Inspector Brenton Saunders told ABC News Breakfast that the search for the man's body had to be curtailed in fading light last night but will resume this morning.
Police, SES and fisheries officials will be on the water to scour the site of the attack.
The abalone boat was removed from the beach last night and is being inspected by police.
Inspector Glen Sickerdick from South Australian Police Communications says detectives will be conducting an investigation into the incident.
"At this stage we haven't recovered the body. The body didn't return to the surface once it was taken by the sharks," he said.
The president of the Abalone Industry Association of South Australia, Jonas Woolford, says local abalone divers have been rocked by the event.
"They're all extremely upset about it, most of them were all out diving as well. It is devastating what's happened. Our own diver's been taken by a shark," he said.
The Point Avoid region is notoriously rough and known for sharks, and there has been a big increase in shark sightings in recent weeks on the Lower Eyre Peninsula.
Two weeks ago the ABC was told of one diver who ducked to avoid a five-metre white pointer.
He was brushed by the shark as it swam away.

Marie Kondo's "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up," the top-ranked book on The New York Times list of self-help books, promises that, once your house is orderly, you can "pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life." —the Times.
When tidying up in a house that contains a baby, the first thing to consider is the question of ownership. To whom do the onesies, blankets, and toys belong—you or the baby? A good rule of thumb is: if it's something like a hairbrush or nail clipper that you use on the baby, it belongs to you; if it's something that the baby uses, like the blankie or the iPad, it belongs to the baby.
Obviously, babies cannot speak. This may prove problematic when you are trying to determine whether or not the baby's belongings are sparking joy in the baby. If you are particularly attuned to your child, you might be able to tell when that rush of joy floods his or her little body. If, however, you are unable to do so, you must shoulder the responsibility of determining the joy-inducing capacity of any given object until your child is sufficiently verbal.
The KonMari method dictates the separation of adult belongings into categories. With baby items, the lines become fuzzier: is a binky with a woobie attached a toy, or bedding? Is a Moby wrap clothing, or a noose? Best, then, to simplify into only two groups: onesies, and anything that is not a onesie.
When considering a onesie, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a onesie that sparks joy. This may confuse you, if you are still able to dimly recall a time when onesies were capable of sparking joy. You may remember cooing over their smallness, chuckling at the clever phrases printed on them, and thinking, “It is important that the world perceive my baby to be a Ramones fan.” But this was all before you gave birth. Now you know the truth—that babies grow out of onesies on a weekly basis, and that no matter how darling the graphic, everything stops being cute when it is covered in fecal matter. So never forget: onesies are disposable.
For the non-onesie category, the process is as follows. Gather all items into a pile. Begin to sort through them one by one. Does that black-and-white book about animals spark joy? Or does it inspire irritation, because really, how on earth could somebody be the "author" of something that is just a list of eleven nouns? Is the plastic needlepoint alphabet set in the plastic needlepoint box that your mother picked up at her church bazaar sparking joy, or a cold rage that has nothing to do with the item itself and everything to do with your mother? This bottle of Thunderbird sparks joy, but does it belong among your child's things?
The important thing to remember is that the joy these items spark is ephemeral at best, contained in the moment when they were first received. Thank the items for it, and then set them on fire.
New things, of course, will wend their way into your home, brought by well-meaning friends and relatives. And it will be difficult for them to understand why their gifts are being received with gut-wrenching sobs. When they ask what's wrong, your choices are these: You can pause, take a few deep breaths, and explain to your mother-in-law that while you truly appreciate the time she took to crochet the abomination she's calling a baby blanket, it is very important that your home be as neat as possible, and a tangle of scratchy, pink acrylic yarn does not have a place in it. Alternately, you can keep your feelings hidden until they leave, and then pick that god-awful blanket apart stitch by stitch. It's remarkably meditative.
Finally, we come to the baby. When determining the level of joy sparked by your baby, remove your baby from its crib and run your hands over it. Does the baby spark joy? Are you, indeed, capable of joy anymore? If the baby sparks nothing but a black, yawning chasm of fear and doubt, thank the baby for its service, fold it, and store it in a cool, dry place. (A tip for storing your baby: Fold along the center line, then fold the edge in to create a rectangle, roll up—face-out—and place in closet.)
A bus strike in West Vancouver could cut public transit service to BC Ferries' Horseshoe Bay Terminal by Friday, officials are warning.
Already this week an overtime ban has led to the cancellation of dozens of trips on the West Vancouver service since Monday.
Now, the union representing drivers and maintenance workers is warning there could be a full strike later this week that would shut down the entire service.
"That will mean that the buses will be off the road for some period of time by the end of the week," said Amalgamated Transit Union spokesman Bill Tieleman on Wednesday.
"That would remove the option of taking Blue Buses to the ferries," he said.
24 hours notice promised
It remains unclear when and if a strike will take place, but a statement on the District of West Vancouver website said a full strike could start as early as Friday morning.
"The District of West Vancouver understands the transit union is planning a full strike on Friday morning (October 21). We encourage Blue Bus users to make alternate travel arrangements for that day."
Along with about a dozen suburban routes, West Vancouver operates the main express bus service, the 257 route, which connects Metro Vancouver's public transit system to the BC Ferries terminal at Horseshoe Bay.
Greyhound and Tofino Bus also run buses about four times a day from the Vancouver bus station that connect with the ferries.
Tieleman said the union is still hopeful a full strike can be averted, but it is preparing to escalate job action shortly if there is no progress towards a deal.
"We'll give 24 hours notice to our riders to make sure they have alternatives for getting around, but we'll have more about it by the end of the day," he said.
The union's contract with the District of West Vancouver expired on March 31, 2016 and negotiations began in May.
Talks between the district and the Amalgamated Transit Union broke down Friday and the union was in a legal strike position Sunday.
Rupert Murdoch is reported to be building a newspaper pay cartel that will see free newspaper sites disappear along with News Corp sites in the next 12 months.
According to the LA Times, News Corp's Jonathan Miller mas met with major news publishers including New York Times Co., Washington Post Co., Hearst Corp. and Tribune Co. The report did not note the success or otherwise of the talks
The move by News Corp makes sense form their perspective: they can't put up the pay wall and succeed if the competition continues to offer their content for nothing. In theory, most major newspapers doing pay at the same time would maximize sales opportunities for the pay sites; well, that's the play book News Corp is running by.
The move though raises serious anti-trust issues; the four companies named account for around 80-90% of the US newspaper market, and collusion would lessen competition.
On a bright note, the market in 12 months time for new media startups is going to be even better now all the newspapers are signing up to commit ritual suicide.
Hey, a game finished and we didn't lose any players for the season or for an extended period of time! PROGRESS!
Andy Reid said at his press conference this afternoon the team is coming out of the Miami game healthy and without any significant injuries. This is good news as the Chiefs came out of their first two regular season games with injuries to significant players on both sides of the ball. Getting out of a game in one piece seems like a miracle at this point.
Further, we have updates on Jamaal Charles, Eric Berry, and De'Anthony Thomas. First, the Chiefs will not practice today, Tuesday, or Wednesday given that their next game is on a Monday night. Typically the Chiefs practice Wednesday thru Friday on regular weeks but with the extra day the Chiefs will bump everything an extra day to Thursday thru Saturday. This schedule change should give everyone an extra day to rest and heal.
The extra day should be beneficial to Charles, Berry, and Thomas, too. All three are said to be making progress and expected to be at practice on Thursday. To what degree they will participate in practice and what that means for their status next Monday is unknown.
Of those three players Charles would seem like the best bet to return against the New England Patriots. Charles tested out the ankle before Sunday's game in Miami and was listed as questionable last week in the injury report. One would think that would be a good indicator that he is not too far away from returning.
DAT practiced once last week before the Chiefs shut him down again. Thomas seemed pretty positive on his Twitter account today about the potential of him returning to action.
Berry's progress is a little less known but it is a good sign he will be joining Charles and DAT in returning to practice on Thursday.

Malware for Linux becomes more and more diverse. Among them are spyware programs, ransomware, and Trojans designed to carry out DDoS attacks. Doctor Web security researchers examined yet another cybercriminals' creation dubbed Linux.Ekoms.1. This Trojan can periodically take screenshots and download different files to a compromised machine.
Once launched, Linux.Ekoms.1 checks whether one of subfolders in the home directory contains files with specified names. If it fails to find any, it randomly chooses a subfolder to save its own copy there. Then, the Trojan is launched from new location. If successful, the malicious program establishes connection to the server whose addresses are hard-coded in its body. All information transmitted between the server and Linux.Ekoms.1 is encrypted.
Every 30 seconds the Trojan takes a screenshot and saves it to a temporal folder in the JPEG format. If the file is not saved, the Trojan tries to save it in the BMP format. The temporary folder is downloaded to the server in specified intervals.
One of system threads created by the Trojan generates a filtering list for the "aa*.aat", "dd*ddt", "kk*kkt", "ss*sst” files that are searched in the temporary location and uploads the files that match these criteria to the server. If the answer is the uninstallation line, Linux.Ekoms.1 downloads the executable file from the server, saves it to the temporary folder and runs it. Moreover, the Trojan can download and save a number of other files.
Along with the ability of screenshot taking, the Trojan's code contains a special feature to record sound and save it as the .aat file in the WAV format. However, in fact, this feature is not used anywhere. The entry for Linux.Ekoms.1 was added to the Dr.Web virus databases. Therefore, this malicious program poses no threat to our users.

Near Washington, D.C.'s Deanwood neighborhood, there are plans to construct a brand new mixed-use project, developed by The Warrenton Group.
The property is located at 5119-5123 and 5127 Nannie Helen Borroughs Avenue NE and 612 Division Avenue NE, just southeast of two D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) properties, the Lincoln Heights and Richardson Dwellings. A portion of the property houses a carry-out restaurant and vacant buildings.
In an application filed with the Zoning Commission, the developer is asking for the site to be rezoned from MU-3 to MU-5-A. The proposal is to redevelop the property with a mixed-use building containing 1,389 square feet of ground-floor retail and 1,233 square feet of community space topped by a six-story apartment building.
This 78,546-square-foot apartment building will feature 86 residential units, 28 of which will be replacement units for the Lincoln Heights and Richardson Dwellings properties controlled by the DCHA.
There will also be a ground-level parking garage with 17 vehicle spaces and 38 bicycle spaces.
With all of this planned, the developer also plans on renovating the historic Strand Theater, which is adjacent to the proposed mixed-use project. The developer also hopes to seek a commercial tenant to occupy the space. When the Strand Theater first opened in 1928, it was the first motion picture theater constructed east of the Anacostia River for African-American patrons.
Many in Southern California found ways to beat the record-setting heat that swept through the region over the weekend, and that wasn't just limited to humans.ABC7 viewer Marilyn Di Filippo shared video of a bear taking a swim in her swimming pool in Bradbury on Sunday.Shannon Lievense said she was visiting her parents' home for Father's day when she noticed some footprints near the pool.That's when she spotted the bear run from around the corner and jump into the pool."He continued to play around for about 20 minutes. We watched him play with the different rafts and my baby's pool toys," Lievense said.Lievense said bears frequent the San Gabriel Valley neighborhood, and residents know to give them space.As scorching temperatures set in on Father's Day, red-flag and excessive heat warnings were in place for mountain areas in Ventura, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties.Temperatures in the Palm Springs area reached nearly 120 degrees. The heat was expected to linger in the region through Tuesday.For a list of available cooling center, click here

Late last night, rapper B.o.B. let us all in on the little-known secret that the Earth is, in fact, flat. It was then that prominent astrophysicist and killjoy Neil DeGrasse Tyson decided to rain on his parade with “science” and “facts.” Undeterred, B.o.B. has now responded by dropping a diss track that features none other than Tyson himself.
The cities in the background are approx. 16miles apart... where is the curve ? please explain this pic.twitter.com/YCJVBdOWX7 — B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016
After B.o.B. finished his flat-earther rant, which started with the tweet above and went on well into the morning, Neil hit back with the following:
@bobatl Earth's curve indeed blocks 150 (not 170) ft of Manhattan. But most buildings in midtown are waaay taller than that. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016
@bobatl Polaris is gone by 1.5 deg S. Latitude. You've never been south of Earth's Equator, or if so, you've never looked up. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016
@bobatl Duude — to be clear: Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn't mean we all can't still like your music — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016
Then, about an hour ago, B.o.B. let loose a song called Flatline (get it? because it's flat... like the Earth) that features both an out-of-context chunk of Tyson discussing the formation of the Earth and some casual Holocaust denial. Since nothing I could say could possibly do the song justice—please, listen for yourselves.
And just to make sure you didn't miss a thing, here are the lyrics in full, according to Genius.com. (As an added bonus, see how many different conspiracies you can count hiding in the lyrics. I found six.):
Verse 1 Yo, you ain't seen my best
Checkmate, ain't a game of chess
Globalists see me as a threat
Free thinking, got the world at my neck
Hah, am I paranoid? Picture Malcolm X
In a room full of pigs, trying not to bust a sweat
Aye, Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest
They'll probably write that man one hell of a check
Aye, I'm over here on this side of town
Come on over, over, over, over here try to clown
Aye, I never pipe down
If they weren't coming for me then
They're definitively coming for me now
I can't even keep my phone charged up
All this shit I'm talking, I should get my
Rappers get off of my dick, get your own bars up
Now the mirror lizard's breath got the clones scared cuz
Woo, use your, use your common sense
Why is NASA department of defense?
They divided up the seas into thirty-three degrees
Feeding kids masonry, bruh, be careful what you read Hook 1 Flat line, flat line
There's no superior bloodline
Flat line, flat line
You got me once but that died, aye Verse 2 Voice, voice, do I have a voice?
Do I give a fuck? Do I have a choice?
Joint, joint, I roll up a joint
Keep my shooters in the game like I hate to disappoint
I see only good things on the horizon
That's probably why the horizon is always rising
Indoctrinated in a cult called science
And graduated to a club full of liars
Heliocentrism, you were the sixth victim
Fuck you and your team, you could sit on the bench with ‘em
But before you try to curve it, do your research on David Irving
Stalin was way worse than Hitler
That's why the POTUS gotta wear a Kipper
I'm a man first ‘fore an artist
Get a lawyer, look up Doctor Richard [?] Hook 2
Flat line, flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior bloodline Interlude: Neil Tyson
So you want to find the farthest point from that center. And it turns out sea level from the equator is farther away from the center of the Earth than sea level at the poles. It has nothing to do with global warming and melting of the ice caps (Why is that?)
Because we...Earth we know it spins, once uh...a day. Yes thank you. Three people know, uh, how long a day lasts here
(Good for row number two, they're off to a great start)
So you, you know when you spin pizza dough it kind of flattens out. It gets wider in the middle...so Earth throughout it's life, Earth, even when it formed, it was spinning. And it got a little wider at the equator that it does at the poles. So it's not actually a sphere, it's oblate, it's officially an oblate spheroid
But not only that, it's slightly wider below the equator than above the equator
(A little chubbier?)
Little chubbier, chubby's a good word, it's like pear-shaped. It turns out the pear-shapedness is a bigger than the height of mount Everest above sea level
Hook 2
Flat line, flat line
You fooled us for the last time
Flat line, flat line
There's no superior bloodline
Dead
The lessons here, of course, are to never tweet, never release diss tracks at midnight, and—last but not least—to thank god that the year of the celebrity truther has finally arrived.
[rabbitmq-discuss] The Latest revision of NYTimes site is supported by RabbitMQ - launched 8 January 2014
Just a quick note and thank you to the RabbitMQ team for a great product. Our premier online offering www.nytimes.com has a new look and new underpinnings, now including a messaging architecture implemented using RabbitMQ. This architecture - nyt⨍aбrik - has dozens of RabbitMQ instances spread across 6 AWS zones in Oregon and Dublin. The instances are organized into "wholesale" and "retail" layers. Connection to clients is via websockets/sockjs. Upon launch today, the system autoscaled to ~500,000 users. Connection times remained flat at ~200ms. nyt⨍aбrik provides subscription services for breaking news, video feeds, etc. and will add more event based services. It also supports individual messaging related to subscription status for registered users. This system would not have been possible without RabbitMQ. It was the one component, used everywhere, that never faltered or failed. We look forward to contributing our own code to the open source community but it will be difficult to match the quality of this outstanding product and its supporting team.

Hacks / Cheats
The following method no longer works. Its being kept for archive purposes. Do not attempt.
This section will not go into great depth for legality issues. The game is hackable. Here is what you need to do.
You MUST have a 64-bit Operating System in order for this method to work. 32 bit will be detected by Gameguard(Trademark of nProtect).
1) Download the latest version of Cheat Engine
http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php
2) Run Cheat Engine as an administrator.
3) Go to Edit> Settings
4) Select Debugging Options
5) Check the box titled “Try to prevent detection”

8a) Launch the game and click the open process button and select PSO2.
8b)This will bypass Gameguard Revision 1855 which is what PSO2 runs on. I would suggest also running DBVM with Cheat Engine but in most cases this is optional.
You can now search for addresses and edit memory. There are some limitations but if you know what you're doing you can do things like walk through walls, stay jumped, unlimited pp, stat modifier, infinite mag feed etc etc. Use at your own risk. We assume no responsibility for your actions. Cheating is against the ToS and can get you banned.
SINGAPORE - Bookworms and foodies who frequented the old National Library at Stamford Road will remember fondly the familiar face behind Nam Seng's wonton noodles.
Madam Leong Yuet Meng, 88, has operated Nam Seng Noodles & Fried Rice for 58 years running, with more than 40 of those years clocked in at the old hawker centre in front of the library. Nam Seng is now located on the first floor of Far East Square.
At an age where most of her peers have long retired, Madam Leong continues to personally see to the daily running of the stall.
"I wake up every day at about 4am to go to the wet market near my home in Toa Payoh to buy my ingredients, such as fish, prawns and pork, and then prepare the wonton mee at my stall," she told Shin Min Daily News on Monday (March 27).
"The most important thing about food that is good to eat is that the ingredients must be fresh, and the cooking earnest."
Madam Leong has even outlasted the five disciples she taught over the past decades, all of whom have retired and are in their sixties or seventies.
She still keeps in contact with them, and they in turn occasionally pay her a visit to play some mahjong.
"The stall is my lifeblood," said Madam Leong. "I get the greatest satisfaction from customers returning to look for me and eat my food."
GETTY Kim Jong-un has tightened his stranglehold on his citizens
The maximum penalty of a decade is a huge jump from the previous punishment of two-years in jail in what is just the latest attempt to stamp-out Western influence within North Korea's borders. The new penalty also applies to listening to music that is not North Korean.
GETTY Kim Jong-un has become increasingly hostile to the West
Pyongyang has escalated its rhetoric towards foreign powers by conducting a series of military exercises, including missiles launches, despite widespread international condemnation. The hermit nation has promised to strike the US in a number of propaganda videos in recent months too. Satellite images appear to show that the communist country's rocket launcher site is ready for new tests at any time with limited warning.
Experts say the Sohae Satellite Launching Station could be the location of four recent ballistic missile launch exercises overseen by Kim Jong-un in person. Satellite images obtained by North Korea think tank 38 North says recent movement at the site could indicate preparations for a new rocket engine test. Experts say four semi-prepared launch positions can be seen at the site with Kim Jong-un's location during the exercise also pinpointed.

Redbacks win a thriller: the final two balls
South Australia batsman Jake Lehmann has helped the hosts limp over the line in a nerve-jangling two-wicket Sheffield Shield triumph against NSW.
Set just 121 to win, the Redbacks reached their target eight wickets down, largely thanks to Lehmann's decisive 47 not out.
Extended highlights: SA prevail in Shield thriller
On an incredible final day that saw 17 wickets tumble, the left-hander struck Test spinner Nathan Lyon (2-43) for six to bring the scores level before hitting the winning runs through the off-side to spark rapturous celebrations.
SA's chase of the small total began aggressively but Kelvin Smith (12), Jake Weatherald (17) and Callum Ferguson (12) all fell cheaply to NSW's debutant paceman Charlie Stobo (4-46).
Fielding brilliance, Stobo keep NSW's hopes alive
Sam Raphael (4) was run out by a superb Ed Cowan direct hit, which had the Blues believing they were on track for an unlikely victory.

When she first heard there was going to be additional funding for a provincial program to provide autism services to preschool children, Sloan Rees was pleased.
But when the Woodstock resident heard there would only be one service provider for the whole province, instead of the six that were offering services, she was shocked.
"Why fix something that isn't broken?" said Rees, who runs the Autism Family Friendship Group and had a son who accessed the services offered until he went to school.
"Our program, the early intervention, has really been renowned for being effective. I mean I know four families, myself included, that have uprooted their whole family, that come from Ontario and different places to just receive the early intervention that we have here."
Surprising changes
Rees was surprised to hear these changes were being made by the province, considering those who used the services were very happy.
"The majority of the families are surprised," she said.
An announcement regarding these changes, was made on Dec. 20 and Autism Intervention Services of Fredericton was awarded the contract to provide the preschool service province-wide.
Funding per child increased from $27,500 to $33,000. Parents will receive training to increase involvement.
Other changes include working with the school districts to improve transition to school.
Rees said while at first glance the changes looked good, she is concerned the children and parents will lose the individuality they had with the companies in their area and some of the services they offered.
"Autism is a very complex disorder. You have kids that are high functioning and kids that are low functioning, they have different abilities and to lose that individuality, even though it may not sound very important, for some families it's a really big deal."
Rees said only offering in-home therapy might be what is considered best, but it is not always practical for families that go to work.
"It's good in theory but again, I'm a little apprehensive...not to mention the fact that you're going to have the transition."
Rees said she is also worried children will be losing out during that time.
"It's a big change."
Smooth transition
But Autism Intervention Services CEO Danielle Pelletier, said she is confident the transition will go well and there won't be any gaps in the service.
"Our goal is that services will just continue without interruptions," she said.
Pelletier expects to have all staffing in place by mid-February. She said a lot of people working for the companies offering the service, have applied for positions with her company.
The CEO said she will do what she can to ensure children and parents have the same person they worked with prior to the change.
In response to concerns of losing individuality because the company is larger, Pelletier said with one company there will now be consistency in the New Brunswick program.
"A team is responsible for 25 clients - every team will be managed exactly the same way around the province. The main strength of our program is that it is individualized for each child."
Pelletier said the service will be offered both in home, child care facilities and autism centres. The first offer of service will be made in the home, the child's natural environment.
"If we cannot find a way to work in the child's natural environment, which is the home or a daycare, then there will be an option of the centre. But the centre is going to be the last resort, not the first."
While Pelletier agreed the change was happening fast, she said it was the government's decision and she is ready to meet the deadline.
With its focus on immigration, the hearing seemed incongruous with another Senate committee meeting, held just a month before, in which local police chiefs had a much different answer for the apparent return of MS-13.
In many ways, the gang is Trump's perfect villain. It's exclusively Latino and recruits in heavily migrant neighborhoods, its members known for their face tattoos and savagery. The Time reference was one of his earliest, but Trump often mentions MS-13 to reinforce his immigration policy. In April, he tweeted, “Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.” Just last week, at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Trump told the crowd, “You have a gang called MS-13. They don't like to shoot people. They like to cut people. They do things that nobody can believe. These are true animals.”
MS-13's activities appear to have become more aggressive in some states recently, but Trump's understanding of the gang also seems limited to headlines. “The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. Allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across the U.S. … ,” he's tweeted. But what he omits is that MS-13 in the U.S operates like most other domestic gangs, and that law enforcement in cities where MS-13 has recently doubled homicide rates don't see the gang as a problem that deportations can solve. It's a gang, distinct in some ways, but ultimately like many others.
It was the deportation policies of the Clinton administration, in fact, that created MS-13. The gang began in Los Angeles, among Salvadoran immigrants living near Pico Union. In the 1980s, the U.S. had backed El Salvador's military dictatorship against Marxist guerillas. Some 75,000 people died in the civil war, and many more fled. When Salvadoran migrants settled in Los Angeles, they landed in neighborhoods controlled by black or Mexican gangs at a time when violence in the U.S. was on the rise. By the late 1980s, the Los Angeles Police Department began what it called Operation Hammer, a crackdown on gangs that filled California prisons. Under the Clinton administration, federal agents tried to empty the prison by deporting undocumented gang members back to El Salvador, where civil war had left the country with little rule of law.
In one four-year period, the U.S. deported more than 20,000 criminals to El Salvador, and with them they brought tactics learned from U.S gangs. In Los Angeles, MS-13 learned to control territory and how to earn money through extortion. Now in El Salvador, the gang took over neighborhoods and feuded with its rival, Barrio 18, another U.S.-born gang. El Salvador had never dealt with such a problem, so just as MS-13 learned from its counterparts in Los Angeles, the Salvadoran government copied L.A.'s approach. El Salvador's strategy was called “Mano Dura,” and from 2003 to 2005 the country jailed 31,000 young people, though nearly all would later be released without charges. The approach backfired, and it's blamed for increasing MS-13's ranks. Young men who may have only had loose affiliation with the gang became its leaders. Violence in El Salvador escalated to near-civil war rates, and within a generation the children of those who'd fled war, and who were then were deported, had destabilized the country so thoroughly that it fueled another mass migration.
As the Virginia Cavaliers closed out a big 30-13 victory over Miami, the mood at Scott Stadium was revelrous. But "Goose Guy" put everyone else to shame. Yes, ESPN cameras caught a student on the hill, singing Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" into a GOOSE - the full scene is shown in this video:
Because the internet is the internet, this obviously blew up across social media, as Caroline touched on in her "Monday Motivation."
Goose Guy is actually a fourth-year student named Brandon DeCoursey, DeCoursey, who will graduate this spring with a degree in electrical engineering, is a Sagittarius who likes The Notebook and red roses. (He volunteered this information). When he's not watching chick flicks, he also runs triathlons. And ladies, he's single! (Based on some of the female reaction I've seen on social media, this is apparently important information).
And we have more good news, Internet Goose Guy fans! We spoke to this new celebrity to learn more about this strange, strange performance:
Streaking the Lawn: Why in the world did you have a goose with you at a UVA football game? Did you consider other props?
Goose Guy: First off, the goose's name is Alfred. I bought him from my neighbor when she moved from her house last year. I thought maybe he'd be good luck, so I took him to the Oregon game last year. It paid off for the first half. I kept taking him to games because I figured, "Alright. At some point, he has to be lucky." Then we beat VMI, so obviously he's lucky.
I did consider other inanimate, plastic animals, but I have a mortal fear of geese. No lie, I was attacked by a Canada goose on a run one time in high school, long story. I felt that if I faced my fear with geese, the football team could feed off of my strength, all 130 pounds, 5'7" of it.
STL: Is this some sort of common routine you do? Or did ESPN's cameras happen to find you at the best possible moment?
GG: I do this at every home football game I go to. It annoys the crap out of my roommates. I won the iPad from Grand Marc a few weeks ago.
ESPN's cameras did get me at about the perfect time. "Don't Stop Believing" is my go to 80's song; that and the Scorpions' classic "Rock You Like a Hurricane".
STL: Did you know the cameras were on you while you were singing? When did you realize?
GG: I had no idea. I didn't know I had gotten onto any cameras until I left the game and a friend told me I got on camera. I thought he meant the Jumbotron and I missed it. It was when I got back to my apartment and my phone and computer starting buzzing constantly that I found out about ESPN. I figured it would get a little air time and blow over in a few hours.
It quickly became apparent that that would not be the case. I got facebook notifications from my grandmother, which told me that this might be pretty big. I had no idea the YikYak storm that would ensue, either. That caught me by complete surprise.
[Ed Note - YikYak is an app, popular on college campuses, that allows for anonymous discussion. Sure enough, some of the most upvoted current "Yaks" are goose-related]:
STL: Any plans for an encore, or just planning to go out on top?
GG: I think I will probably not be able to top this. It was my last home football game at UVa. This is a great note to leave on. It's fitting that this will likely be my legacy at The University, to be goose guy. Seriously, it surprised none of my friends.
STL: What have the last few days been like? Reveling in your newfound internet glory?
GG: I have been busy with my capstone and a presentation I have to give tomorrow. I had to try to sleep last night, because I had to wake up at 5:30 this morning, currently operating on 3 hours of sleep. I LOVE reading YikYak right now. I feel like the mood of the entire University changed. It's awesome to feel like I helped make people happy in what was not a great week.
I am trying to keep a level head about the whole thing. I do have a bit of an ego, so I am not going out of my way to advertise who I am. I understand that it's going to blow over in a few days and I will go back to being normal, old Brandon. I am trying to pretend like nothing has changed. I'm bad at it.
STL: Anything else you'd like to share with your new legions of Internet fans?
GG: Yeah. I was sober when I did that. I wish I could blame it on the Goose and how it had me feelin' loose. Truth is, I am just a really goofy dude. Also, I accept Venmo and am currently in debt for 4 years of tuition, so... yeah...
Thanks again to Brandon to take the time to talk to me - he's obviously a funny dude, and friends say he's a good one as well. All spirit is good spirit!
The uphill battle to save rhinos in Mozambique
American photojournalist Martin Totland travelled to the borderlands between Mozambique and Kruger National Park to investigate the latest in the anti-poaching war
It was widely reported in 2013 that poachers had killed Mozambique's last rhino. The good news: it wasn't true. The bad news: it will very likely soon become true.
It is an open secret among conservationists that Mozambique still has some rhinos left. They wander the 30,000ha property of Sabie Game Park, a privately owned game reserve in the south-western part of the country.
The park straddles the border with South Africa and its world-famous Kruger National Park, where nearly 80% of the world's remaining rhinos live. This area is the front line of the rhino war and if you ask those involved, the future's not looking too bright.
Like many others, I saw the news stories and I kept noticing people in the comment sections cheering whenever stories emerged of rangers killing poachers. People applauded rangers for killing people in a fight over a useless commodity. Poachers were called evil monsters, and rangers were called heroes. This two-dimensional image didn't seem right.
In March, police seized 23 rhino horns and other illegal wildlife artefacts at Maputo International Airport but made no arrests. During April and May, Mozambican law enforcement agencies carried out nationwide seizures of more than 900 pieces of rhino horn, and arrested one suspect. Officials said they hoped the suspect would lead them to a criminal syndicate behind the poaching.
On May 2, a Vietnamese citizen was arrested at the Maputo airport with two suitcases crammed with 11 whole rhino horns and several horn segments. And on May 14, photos emerged online of yet another rhino slain in Mozambique, its missing horn very likely being prepared for transport out of the country.
I went to Mozambique to find out more about why so many Mozambicans enter a trade that costs so many of their lives, what's driving a charismatic species closer to extinction, and what the future looks like. I decided to go to the frontlines to gain a better understanding.
In Mozambique I met a group of guys with more than a decade of combined experience in the conservation and anti-poaching world. They aren't rangers, park managers, or government officials.
Because of the dangers inherent to pursuing ruthless criminal syndicates and taking their money away, I have to protect the real identities of the men I interviewed and spent time with in Mozambique. If they were to be identified, that information could be used against them, and lives could be lost.
Since 2013 they have gathered information about Mozambique's poaching economy and its major players. They use this information and cooperate with law enforcement agencies to pursue mid-level players in the international rhino horn trade.
Think of it like this: the people who poach rhinos are at the bottom rung of a vast shadow economy. Even if you arrest 100 of them a week, more will replace them, drawn by the promise of big money, a daring adventure and, perhaps most importantly, the chance to feed their family.
The leader of the team refers to the bottom-level poachers as “cannon fodder.” While that might sound cruel, it's not wrong: South African park rangers killed more than 500 poachers between 2010 and 2015, according to news reports.
Trying to eliminate the “cannon fodder” is a waste of time, so the team sets their sights on the next two rungs in the poaching hierarchy: the local crime bosses who finance the poaching, supply the firearms, and sell the horn; and the people who arrange for transport of horns to Asia. By intervening at these levels, the team hopes to remove the economic incentives motivating the bottom-rung poachers, forcing them to find better ways to make money.
Poaching capital
I got to see how this works on a trip to Massingir with a team member. Massingir, a growing town in Gaza province situated about 10km east of Kruger National Park, is considered the poaching capital of Mozambique. Nearly 80% of people in the town are involved, either directly or indirectly. If you spend enough time here you will inevitably meet some of them.
One of team's older sources introduced us to a new one, and we spent the day together. If you want people in a town like Massingir to be your friend and talk to you, there is only one reliable course of action, which is drinking. So that is what we did.
The new source was clearly nervous, avoided eye contact, and said almost nothing. We bought him food and beer, made jokes, drove him around town, and were very friendly and helpful. When we drove him home at night he was still nervous, but thanked us for the ride as he left.
We couldn't expect him to tell us everything he knew, but the first brick of groundwork had been laid: we got to know him, and started earning his trust. Recruiting sources is a long game that cannot be rushed. A few weeks after my visit, the team member returned to Massingir with a colleague and continued the work.
If a source provides reliable information on a suspect, it is analysed and handed over to a prosecutor, who decides if it's above board and passes it on to the police. This cooperation between law enforcement agencies in Mozambique is slowly making an impact.
On the ground
As a contrast, I moved on to spend time with a traditional anti-poaching outfit based at Sabie Game Park, which borders the Kruger park in the south. I wanted to get a better understanding of the underlying factors that motivate poachers from this outfit, the International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF).
At Sabie, managing the park is divided between the park's staff and the IAPF, an independent organisation that operates there. The staff tracks animals and cares for wildlife and visitors, while the IAPF protects the remaining rhinos from poachers.
Every day rangers patrol the park, but because of its vast size and their limited personnel, they have to be strategic about where they focus their efforts. For instance, they routinely check the areas close to the border fence with the Kruger since they're more likely to find poachers there.
I joined the IAPF rangers on a daily hike through the bush and found several signs of intruders through the day. First, in a dense stretch of bush we found a small cave used to stash weapons. The opening had been partially closed off, with stacked rocks carefully placed to hide things inside. Normally it would be used for weapons, but this time there was nothing inside.
Later, we found several backpacks, clothes and food tins left behind, only a few minutes from the border. They were left in the shade of a big tree on a hill, a strategic hiding spot for poachers needing a place to rest before entering Kruger. Interestingly, we also found a jug of muti, a potion made by local witch doctors. Poachers believe that drinking it makes them invisible to park rangers.
The IAPF rangers collect all such items and take them to their headquarters for analysis, in case they turn up any useful clues.
In addition to these hikes, they do car patrols along the roads of the park and aerial patrols. Every day at first and last light, a volunteer pilot flies over the park, looking for tracks, people, breached fences, animal carcasses and anything else that suggests poachers have been there. The pilot is joined by a spotter, who has binoculars and stays in radio contact with rangers on the ground. If they see something from the plane, they tell the rangers to check it out.
I joined one of these morning flights. I was impressed when the pilot spotted a dead tree full of vultures and correctly guessed that an animal carcass was nearby. From the air we saw what looked like a dead rhino lying in the grass. On a second pass we saw that it was a dead buffalo.
The spotter told the rangers, who otherwise might have seen the vultures from a distance and walked over to check it out. This way, they saved their time and energy for more important things, like tracking the few remaining rhinos still in the park.
Whenever we saw a rhino from the plane, the IAPF spotter plotted its location on a map and shared the location with the rangers. In addition to searching for poachers, the rangers also spend their days simply following rhinos around the park – from a safe distance – keeping tabs on their movements. This gives the IAPF a quick response time in case gunshots ring out unexpectedly.
The tight ship IAPF runs at Sabie seems to pay off, buy why does the rhino's future still look so grim?
Simply put, these outfits are exceptions in a world where many conservation organisations don't cooperate enough (there are more than 440 separately registered rhino conservation organisations in South Africa alone, all of them with separated resources, money and information), where vast levels of corruption halts progress, where distrust harms relationships between parks and locals, and overwhelming levels of poverty force people to poach.
On the black market rhino horn can fetch prices higher than cocaine, gold and platinum. It's no wonder that many people want a slice of that pie. They live in a poor country where being lucky enough to have a stable job is still no guarantee that you'll make enough money to provide for your family. Even if you're a police officer or a security force member, minimum wage is still just over 3,000 meticais per month, or US$60.
A 2014 report from the US State Department, titled Poaching rhino horn in South Africa and Mozambique: Community and expert views from the trenches, took a comprehensive look at the key factors behind poaching in rural Mozambique and South Africa. Economic incentives are listed as one of the most important ones.
Locally available jobs, “like farming, animal husbandry, selling charcoal, or irregular work in neighbouring cities, simply cannot compare with ‘the gold in the horn',” according to the report. It goes on to quote several locals from poaching communities on both sides of the border, including Massingir.
An unemployed man from Kabok, a town close to Massingir, was quoted on the connection between poverty, unemployment and poaching. It is emblematic of views held by many people in these communities: “If we had jobs, we wouldn't even be thinking of poaching, because when you are working, you get home tired, take a bath, eat and go to sleep. Come payday and you are able to put food on the table.” Many others echo this view, which supports the fact that poverty is a huge contributing factor.
Add to that a level of cynicism, and you can see how hard it is to unite a community around rhino conservation. The people I spoke to said many locals in Mozambique simply don't care if rhinos go extinct: they don't see rhinos as a benefit to them, only to the parks and wealthy people whose business depends on these animals. To many poor locals it simply doesn't matter if rhinos go extinct: if they can make big money from the rhinos by taking their horns, all the better for them.
One young man quoted in the report crystallised this view when he said: “We don't care about xibanjane [local slang for “going for the horn”], whether it continues or not, unless if the park changes its attitude because what kind of neighbours are they that we can't even get water to drink from the park. Xibanjane can continue, we don't care, it doesn't change our lives.” His quote touches on the deep level of distrust that exists between locals and the parks.
Moral issue
It became clear to me that this is one of the biggest impediments to successful rhino conservation: park stewards and rangers don't trust locals because they have experienced local employees giving information to poachers in exchange for money.
In turn, locals don't trust the parks because of a deep-seated sense that rhinos are more important to them than people. In many instances, locals who make their living from cattle herding and animal husbandry receive no compensation when wildlife kill their animals or trample their crops. Moreover, resettlement projects to move those who live inside the parks have created a lot of anger and frustration, where locals have either refused to move, or moved back into the park later on.
These conflicts will continue to complicate rhino conservation for quite some time. I asked everyone I met in Mozambique if they were hopeful about saving the rhino from extinction. The overwhelming answer was, sadly, “No.”
One of the anti-poaching team members in Sabie expressed dismay over how little progress was being made. “I don't think we can stop it. All we can do is slow it down,” he said. “But it's a moral issue. We continue anyway, because it's the right thing to do.”

(CNSNews.com) – European lawmakers this month will vote on a measure that promotes abortion as a fundamental human right, while taking aim at the conscientious objection rights of pro-life doctors and health workers.
Critics see the move as an attempt to dictate abortion policy to individual European Union governments, despite an acknowledgement by leading E.U. institutions that there is no consensus on the matter across the 28 member-states.
The controversial draft report, which is being promoted by socialist members of the European Parliament (MEPs), was passed last month by the legislature's committee on women's rights and gender equality.
According to supporting documents, 20 E.U. member-states legally permit abortion on demand, while six others have limitations which are either interpreted broadly (Britain, Finland, Cyprus) or restrictively (Ireland, Poland, Luxembourg). Malta prohibits all abortions. (The 28th and newest member, Croatia, had not joined the E.U. when the legislation was being drafted.)
Even in countries where abortion is legal, the report states, it is often made unavailable “through the abuse of conscientious objection or overly restrictive interpretations of existing limits.” Other obstacles include “medically unnecessary waiting periods or biased counseling.”
(Some E.U. countries have compulsory waiting period of up to seven days and pre-abortion counseling, either for all women or in some cases for adolescents only.)
The measure would therefore require member states to “regulate and monitor the use of conscientious objection so as to ensure that reproductive health care is guaranteed as an individual's right, while access to lawful services is ensured and appropriate and affordable referrals systems are in place.”
An explanatory note complains that objectors deny women information about and access to “lawful interruption of pregnancy.”
“There are cases reported from Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Ireland and Italy where nearly 70 percent of all gynecologists and 40 percent of all anesthesiologists conscientiously object to providing abortion services,” it says. “These barriers clearly contradict human rights standards and international medical standards.”
Aside from the anti-conscientious objection language, arguably the most explosive part of the draft report is a clause that says “as a human rights concern, abortion should be made legal, safe and accessible to all.”

In a minority opinion committee member Anna Zaborska, a pro-life Slovak MEP, said the report could not be used to establish a “right to abortion.”
“No international legally binding treaty nor the ECHR [European Convention on Human Rights] nor customary international law can accurately be cited as establishing or recognizing such right,” she said.
“All E.U. institutions, bodies and agencies must remain neutral on the issue of abortion.”
Zaborska, who represents the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and is a former chairwoman of the committee, also objected strongly to the language about conscientious objection.
“No person, hospital or institution shall be coerced, held liable or discriminated against in any manner because of a refusal to perform, accommodate, assist or submit to practices which could cause the death of a human embryo,” she said.
European Dignity Watch, a pro-life non-governmental organization based in Brussels, slammed the attempt to establish “a so-called ‘right to abortion.'”
“The majority who voted in favor of the report in committee bluntly ignores that such a right exists nowhere in international law and is ready to sacrifice internationally-recognized rights, such as the right to conscientious objection,” it said in a statement.
“Their ideological zeal to trample on other rights and impose the ‘right to abortion' on the rest of Europe embodies precisely the arrogant and patronizing attitude that threatens the freedom of conscience — and that we should all vociferously reject.”
Another part of the report says member-states should ensure compulsory sex education for all children, both in and out of school, which “must include the fight against stereotypes and prejudices, shed light on gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and structural barriers to substantive equality.”
“One can only speculate on the exact method of implementation of these noble-sounding but eminently dangerous aims,” said European Dignity Watch, “but there is a clear political will that some of these radical ideas would be transmitted to pupils through the educational system.”
The report also calls on on the E.U. to finance abortion in developing countries as part of the E.U. development aid program, which it says should have “a strong and explicit focus, and concrete targets on SRHR [sexual and reproductive health and rights].”
It argues that “investments in reproductive health and family planning are among the most cost-effective, in terms of development, and the most effective ways to promote the sustainable development of a country.”
Push back
The report heads for a vote by the full European Parliament later this month at a time when citizens are pushing back against abortion funding.
Under the Lisbon Treaty, an effort to reform and strengthen the E.U., a new tool called the European citizens' initiative (ECI) was introduced with the aim of improving participatory democracy.
November 1 this year is the deadline for the first registered ECIs to pass a target of one million signatures, including a proscribed minimum number of signatures required from at least seven member-states. Currently only two are on track, and one of them is a pro-life initiative that seeks to end E.U. funding for abortion and all research practices involving the destruction of human embryos.
With three weeks to go to the deadline, the initiative known as “One of us” has attracted more than 1.2 million signatures. It has received the backing of the Pope, and the largest numbers of signatures so far have come from Italy, Poland, Germany, Romania and France.
Under the ECI rules, the E.U.'s executive commission will have three months to respond to an initiative that meets the requirements.
A European Dignity Watch study last year found that two of the world's largest abortion providers, Marie Stopes and International and International Planned Parenthood Federation, are recipients of E.U. development funding.
Banning E.U. funding for abortion would be a similar move to the Mexico City Policy, a Reagan-era measure that prohibits U.S. aid to organizations that promote or perform abortions around the world.
The politically-sensitive policy, which opponents call the “global gag rule,” was rescinded by President Clinton in 1993, revived by President Bush in 2001, and reversed again by President Obama in 2009.
Amazon Unless you stick to a daily uniform like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg, everyone has that frustrating moment once in a while where you just can't decide what to wear.
Amazon wants to help with that. The online retail giant rolled out a feature in March called Outfit Compare, which lets you upload two different outfits and get an opinion on which one looks better.
The feature is free and available in Amazon's mobile app, but only Prime members can use it. And while Amazon famously doesn't reveal how many Prime subscribers it has, estimates peg that number around 80 million in the US — which means a lot of people have access to this feature and may not even realize it.
If Outfit Compare sounds familiar, it's because Amazon launched a similar service called Style Check in conjunction with the launch of its Echo Look device, an Alexa-enabled camera that can take full-length photos or videos of you, help you build a "personal lookbook," and give a second opinion on your outfit.
But Outfit Compare has one key difference: While Style Check uses both machine learning and a fashion specialist to provide a verdict, Outfit Compare relies solely on real humans to judge your look.
I tested out Outfit Compare over the course of a few weeks. I didn't often use it to decide between two different tops or to pick the right pair of shoes, mainly because I didn't have the luxury of time in the morning or a full-length mirror at home. But snapping a quick mirror photo of my outfit each day did help me gain a lot of insight into how others might view my style.

Paramount has enough confidence in Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible 5 that it moved its release date way up, from Christmas to July 31. But the production recently shut down for a week or so in London because the film's ending was deemed unsatisfactory.
Director Christopher McQuarrie was given the extra time to work out a new and improved finale with a writer friend whose identity remains a mystery and who will neither be paid nor credited.
It's unusual and costly for a big-budget film to halt in the middle of production, especially one with a release date about five months away. While one source claims McQuarrie was "scrambling" to come up with an ending that would work, a Paramount insider puts a more positive spin on the break.
"Chris, Tom and a third person wanted to take a minute to get from what they thought was a good place to a more perfect place," says this person, noting that if the studio had been really concerned, it would not have moved up the release date.
Paramount suffered through more serious third-act problems with its 2013 zombie apocalypse movie World War Z. That film, starring Brad Pitt and directed by Marc Forster, was shut down and its final third reconceived, with its release date pushed back several times. It ultimately became a hit when it finally reached theaters.
One high-level executive jokes that M:I5 is not in any way seriously behind schedule, saying, "Are you kidding? We made World War Z."
The last film in the Cruise-fronted series, Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (released in Dec. 2011), earned nearly $650 million globally, a franchise best.
There's been a shift in the balance of power on the Hawke's Bay Regional Council, with the majority now not in complete favour of the Ruataniwha water storage project.

Five of the nine elected councillors have said they oppose the dam or have major questions about it.
The regional council has yet to decide whether to go ahead with the project, and the $900 million scheme also faces legal hurdles.
The council wants to dam 22ha of formerly-protected land, flood it and give the department 170ha of nearby farmland in return.
The Court of Appeal has ruled the process of acquiring the protected conservation land was unlawful and ordered the Director-General of Conservation to reconsider his decision on the land swap.
The Department of Conservation and the council have jointly sought leave to challenge that ruling in the Supreme Court.
Now, dam critics Rick Barker, Tom Belford, Rex Graham and Peter Beaven have all been re-elected.
They will be joined by new councillor Paul Bailey, who is an anti-dam campaigner.
Mr Bailey said voters had given councillors the mandate to stop the dam going any further.
"To my mind it's an absolute game changer," he said.
Mr Bailey said he wanted to find out how much it would cost to cancel current dam-related contracts.
He also expected the current council chairman, Fenton Wilson, to be replaced.
Another newly elected councillor, former New Zealand First and independent MP Neil Kirton, said there should be a moratorium on the dam until the council has its ducks in a row.
Lawmakers who were early champions of a U.S. strike on Assad regime targets in Syria have stayed mum as video clips emerge appearing to show opposition soldiers both killing unarmed men and indicating they have possession of chemical weapons.
The latest, a video on InfoWars.com, purported to show a rebel militant in Syria claiming to have chemical weapons, and saying he's willing to target women and children. The video, which FoxNews.com has not been able to independently authenticate, only adds to the confusion over which side has the moral high ground and the reasons for U.S. military action in Syria.
President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry made the case for American involvement based on evidence they claim shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime using chemical weapons against hundreds of children, and others. Videos were released to the media and seemed to show children disoriented, crying and writhing around in pain on makeshift cots.
Few outside the Assad regime and its closest allies have challenged American claims that the Syrian government was most likely behind the attack. But the powerful images which shaped the early case for a military mission are being countered with videos showing deadly and questionable acts on the other side.
Multiple requests seeking comment on the videos to 21 lawmakers who were initially vocal about supporting a strike were not returned. The list includes: Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
On Thursday, Fox News reported on another video posted on a pro-Syrian regime website showing rebel commanders talking about their own “red line” after the government launched a chemical attack against civilians in August.
Obama had used the phrase “red line” last year to describe any use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The video was analyzed by Fox News Middle East specialist Walid Phares, as well as a separate Pentagon expert. According to both sources, one of the men in the video is identified as a deputy to General Salim Idris, leader of the Free Syrian Army, the same group some members of Congress hailed as a moderate in their push for U.S. action.
Yigal Carmon, the president of the Middle East Media Research Institute, who also reviewed the tape, said, "The message is if the West doesn't act, we (the rebels) too will have no red lines, and will use chemical weapons."
If authentic, the videos could cause problems for the administration as it argues the Assad regime -- and the Assad regime alone -- must be punished for violating "international norms" with the use of chemical weapons.
On Thursday, The New York Times published a front-page story as well as an online video smuggled out of Syria showing rebel fighters executing seven unarmed government soldiers.
The footage shows Syrian rebels holding firearms and standing over seven shirtless, kneeling male prisoners with their hands tied behind their backs and their heads pressed to the ground. The video goes to black as the men are executed one by one.
Idris, speaking to Fox News via Skype from an undisclosed location on Friday, said the footage was a year old and didn't reflect the majority of rebels.
Still, Obama seemed resolved in his decision to push forward with a strike.
"There are times where we have to make hard choices if we're going to stand up for the things we care about," Obama said at a press conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, during the G-20 global economic summit Friday. "I was under no illusions when I embarked on this path, but I think it's the right thing to do."
As Israel carries out yet another attack on Gaza jewellers worldwide continue to conceal the fact that blood diamonds are supporting one of the most abhorrent and prolonged injustices against a defenceless indigenous people. Israel's “prominent and central position” in the global diamond industry has ensured that diamonds which fund war crimes in Palestine evade regulation. Consumers have been kept in the dark and lied to about the extent of the blood diamond problem
Bob Bates, senior editor with JCK magazine, is a diamond industry insider who never tires of throwing dust in the eyes of his readers as he tries to convince them that the diamond market is no longer heavily contaminated with blood diamonds. His latest broadside is aimed at Jason Miklian, a researcher who caused considerable embarrassment for the industry when an article he wrote exposed some of the serious flaws in the Kimberley Process and spawned headlines declaring that 25% of all diamonds are blood diamonds.
Figure 1 – Diamond exports that generate revenue used to fund the Israeli military account for between one quarter and one third of Israel's exports
In the patronising attack piece Bates claims Miklian discredited his original thesis when, in a later article, he used the term “up to 25%” rather than “about 25%” and that the diamonds he referred to were illicit diamonds and not blood diamonds. Bates' arguments fall flat and are unconvincing but his effort exposes some contradictory positions of his own when it comes to blood diamonds.
According to Bates blood diamonds are “diamonds that are associated with violence, whoever the actor.” That simple definition is one I think most people would agree with. “Conflict diamonds”, the restrictive, sanitized term introduced by the diamond industry, are defined by the Kimberley Process (KP) as “rough diamonds used by rebel movements or their allies to fund violence aimed at undermining legitimate governments” (emphasis added). When compared to “conflict diamonds” Bates' blood diamond definition gives one some idea of the enormity of gaping hole in the Kimberley Process regulations which allows blood diamonds to freely enter the market.
Although rough diamonds associated with human rights violations by government forces are not “conflict diamonds” and, therefore, are not banned by the KP, they are blood diamonds. Similarly, cut and polished diamonds that fund human rights violations are not “conflict diamonds” but they are blood diamonds.
By restricting the remit of the KP to “conflict diamonds” and keeping public attention focused on rebel violence associated with the mining sector, the multibillion dollar trade in cut and polished blood diamonds is allowed continue unseen and unchallenged.
In a previous article titled The Other Blood Diamonds, referring to human rights violations by government forces in Angola Bates wrote:
“There isn't the same international consensus among governments about diamonds associated with human rights abuses as there is with conflict diamonds. But really it's hard to see the difference, at least from a consumer point of view. If they knew what was happening in Angola, most consumers would consider those gems blood diamonds.”
Now, however, Bates has rounded on Maklian for regarding “diamonds whose proceeds are used to support governments that commit human rights abuses against their own populations” as blood diamonds.
Bates says it's “quite a broad definition, of the type that NGOs involved in the issue have deliberately avoided, because of the political morass it would raise.” NGOs avoided using this definition not because such diamonds aren't blood diamonds but because doing so would create political problems in the KP. The NGOs that remain within the KP have clearly prioritised avoiding political turmoil over exposing the extent to which the diamond market remains contaminated with blood diamonds that fund rogue regimes. NGOs, whose first priority should be protecting the victims of diamond funded violence, should be highlighting the fact that revenue from the diamond industry continues to fund human rights violations on a massive scale and that consumers are being conned – buying diamonds that are certified as conflict-free even though a high percentage of them are funding gross human rights violations by government forces.
Global Witness, the London-based NGO that was to the fore in exposing the blood diamond wars, had no qualms about exposing the KP charade and withdrew from the scheme in 2011 after it allowed suspected blood diamonds from Zimbabwe to be certified KP compliant and sold on the international market.
The few NGOs remaining within the KP tent continue to prop up the discredited system of self-regulation and are used by the diamond industry to provide a veneer of credibility and respectability to their phony scheme.
Citing spurious examples of diamonds from Russia, some African countries and the USA Bates tries to justify the exclusion of diamonds that fund government violence being labelled blood diamonds. One, very telling, example he failed to mention was diamonds from Israel – a serial human rights offender and major force in the global diamond industry which stands accused of war crimes by the UNHRC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.
The fact that the Israeli diamond industry is estimated to generate about $1 billion/yr. in funding for the Israeli military should have meant diamonds from Israel were regarded as blood diamonds and banned years ago. The vested interests that set up and control the KP, including Israel, the EU and the US, ensure these blood diamonds avail of the KP's protective shield and are stamped conflict-free in accordance with a bogus “System of Warranties” introduced by the World Diamond Council to create the illusion that the KP regulations extend to cut and polished diamonds.
Bates' argument that diamonds from any country accused of human rights violations could be classed as blood diamonds is a fallacious one. Unless revenue from diamonds is a significant source of funding for, or the cause of, human rights violations, as is the case in Israel and parts of Zimbabwe, then it would be difficult to make a credible case for classifying diamonds as blood diamonds.
Figure 2. The tiny Gaza strip is home to 1.6 million people two thirds of them are refugees and their descendants forcibly expelled from their homes, farms and villages inside present-day Israel in order to allow Jewish immigrants seize their property and create an ethnically cleansed electorate for the establishment of a Jewish state.
The case for banning the trade in diamonds from Israel is unquestionable. Israel's record of unregulated nuclear weapons proliferation, war crimes and crimes against humanity, the harrowing situation of the 1.6 million Palestinians crammed into and imprisoned in the besieged Gaza strip plus the millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants languishing in overcrowded refugee camps since 1948 and the suffering of Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem subjugated and tormented by an apartheid regime which is funded to a very significant degree by revenue from the diamond industry are compelling reasons to label diamonds from Israel blood diamonds.
Bates' statement about the situation in Angola is even more applicable to Israel's human rights violations:
“But of course most consumers don't know about this issue. There hasn't been much publicity or a consumer campaign about it. Yet that doesn't mean there won't be. And it could be extremely damaging if there was. The industry has every motivation in the world, for both ethical and business reasons, to get ahead of this issue now, and pressure Angolan miners and the government to clean up their act, before it comes back to bite us.”
The diamond industry in Israel is the cornerstone of the economy that generates the revenue needed to sustain a belligerent apartheid regime which commits serious human rights violations on a daily basis and ignores all attempts by the international community to broker a just and lasting peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians.
The US market consumes 50% of the global diamond production and half of the diamonds sold there come from Israel. Given this reality it is little wonder that when the Texas Jewellers Association recently announced plans for the first ever Israel – Texas diamond fair human rights activists who favour a single democratic state in Palestine/Israel started a petition calling on the TJA to end their collaboration with the Israeli diamond industry. As Rob Bates's said about diamonds from Angola: if they knew what was happening in Palestine, most consumers would regard those gems blood diamonds.
Sean Clinton is a human rights activist from Ireland with a particular interest in Israel/Palestine and the role diamonds play in funding the Zionist project in Palestine. He has authored several articles about the double-standard in the diamond industry which facilitates the trade in cut and polished blood diamonds
Mother convicted for smoking in car
Updated
A woman from Coffs Harbour has been convicted under new laws which make it an offence to smoke with a child in a car, but has escaped a fine.
The 31-year-old was caught by police in August smoking in a car in which her three-year-old child was also a passenger.
She is one of the first people to be charged under the state's tough new anti-smoking laws, which are aimed at protecting children from second-hand smoke.
The penalty for anyone caught smoking in a car with children is an-on-the spot fine of $250.
Yesterday magistrate Judith Fleming convicted the woman of the offence but did not fine her.
The new anti-smoking laws came into force in New South Wales on July 1.

In a small clean room tucked into the back of San Diego–based startup Organovo, Chirag Khatiwala is building a thin layer of human skeletal muscle. He inserts a cartridge of specially prepared muscle cells into a 3-D printer, which then deposits them in uniform, closely spaced lines in a petri dish. This arrangement allows the cells to grow and interact until they form working muscle tissue that is nearly indistinguishable from something removed from a human subject.
The technology could fill a critical need. Many potential drugs that seem promising when tested in cell cultures or animals fail in clinical trials because cultures and animals are very different from human tissue. Because Organovo's product is so similar to human tissue, it could help researchers identify drugs that will fail long before they reach clinical trials, potentially saving drug companies billions of dollars. So far, Organovo has built tissue of several types, including cardiac muscle, lung, and blood vessels.
Unlike some experimental approaches that have used ink-jet printers to deposit cells, Organovo's technology enables cells to interact with each other much the way they do in the body. They are packed tightly together and incubated, prompting them to adhere to each other and trade chemical signals. When they're printed, the cells are kept bunched together in a paste that helps them grow, migrate, and align themselves properly. ­Muscle cells, for example, orient themselves in the same direction to create tissue that can contract.
So far, Organovo has made only small pieces of tissue, but its ultimate goal is to use its 3-D printer to make complete organs for transplants. Because the organs would be printed from a patient's own cells, there would be less danger of rejection.
Organovo plans to fund its organ-­printing research with revenue from printing tissues to aid in drug development. The company is undertaking experiments to prove that its technology can help researchers detect drug toxicity earlier than is possible with other tests, and it is setting up partnerships with major companies, starting with the drug giant Pfizer.
To create the ink that Organovo uses to print tissue, senior scientist Chirag Khatiwala first grows cells in culture.
Once the researchers have enough cells, they apply an enzyme that frees them from the growing surface and then use a centrifuge to pack them into a small, dense pellet like the one seen at the bottom of the vial on the left, which holds skeletal muscle cells. The pellet is sucked up into small glass capillary tubes, which are then incubated in growth medium. During this incubation period, the cells begin to adhere to each other.
Once the cells can hold together as a unit, researchers push them out of the capillary tubes and into a petri dish, where they are submerged in a nutrient broth. The cells feed and continue to interact with each other, sending and receiving chemical signals and forming the beginning stages of solid tissue.
After this period of incubation, the cells are sucked back up into glass capillary tubes that serve as ink cartridges. These are loaded into the printer at right, which has been programmed with the script shown on the computer screen to define the shape that will be deposited.
The printer deposits ink one line at a time on top of a layer of inert gel.
The cells form a rectangle 8 millimeters long by 1.5 millimeters wide. The rectangle can be seen in the center of the back-and-forth pattern shown here. That pattern is made of inert gel that holds the tissue in place so that it won't float away when nutrient medium is added to the dish.
The printed tissue is shown magnified with a microscope and displayed on a computer monitor. Over the next few days, the distinct rows visible here will disappear as the cells divide, communicate, organize, and merge into a single piece of muscle tissue. The muscle tissue is printed in one pass, since a single layer of it is optimal for drug testing, but the printer is just as adept at building multilayered tissue such as functional blood vessels.
This semester, the College of Engineering and Computer Science has seen the largest growth of any college at Cal State Fullerton.
While the growth is a significant achievement for a college that, fewer than 30 years ago was facing a complete shut down, it nonetheless ushers in growing pains that create further issues for the college leadership to address.
In the ‘90s the college faced many problems, a situation which nearly led to the closure of the college.
Those issues resulted from a lack of leadership and expertise, along with a decline in enrollment, said Raman
Unnikrishnan, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science.
“We were considered a prime candidate for closing down,” Unnikrishnan said.
In 1996 Schaffer Associates, a consulting agency, was hired by then University President Milton Gordon to audit the engineering and computer science program.
The agency concluded that faculty at the time was not working together to solve problems, there was a lack of meaningful dialogue regarding the college's budget, and the college could not sustain an environment of change due to a lack of leadership.
Despite these issues the agency recognized the college's success in graduating students, and there were many individuals within the college who did want to work toward change.
The agency recommended the college hire a dean who would focus on correcting the issues plaguing it. Andy Bazar, dean for the college at the time, resigned shortly after the consultation meetings began.
Part of the enrollment decline was also due to the decline of the aerospace industry in California, said Susamma Barua, Ph.D., associate dean for the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences.
Barua, who has worked at CSUF since 1988, said the lack of employment in the industry brought a correlating dearth of funding to the program, and a corresponding decrease in enrollment.
“When enrollment goes down so does the resources that are attached to it,” Barua said. “And because of that we weren't able to hire any new faculty members and didn't have money to upgrade new labs.”
Richard Rocke, Ph.D., came into the university as an acting dean for the college in 1997, where he remained for four years, helping to stabilize the program and its budget.
Rocke connected the college with outside industries that helped bring money into the college, and began the process of examining how money was being spent.
“He did a very good job of stopping the hemorrhage,” Unnikrishnan said.
Unnikrishnan took over as dean in 2001 and has been working to improve the college and increase student success. He started by incorporating a program with foci including recruitment, retention, research, resources and reputation.
“As a dean, I'm responsible for the college's well being,” Unnikrishnan said. “This college was going straight down because it did not have the resources, not the only reason, but I think people were not paying attention to us.”
One of the first things Unnikrishnan noticed when he came into the college was the large amount of part-time faculty, he said.
“Lots of part timers to teach classes with two students, three students, four students–that's a waste,” Unnikrishnan said.
In 1990 the college had an undergraduate enrollment of 1,813 students and a graduate enrollment of 472 students. By 1996 those numbers dropped to 1,035 for undergraduates and 302 for graduate enrollment.
In the years from 2000-2001, ECS had a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,270 students and a graduate enrollment of 381.5 students.
In Fall 2014 the college has a total 2,993 graduate students and 1,229 graduate students.
Majors like computer engineering, software engineering and environmental engineering master's programs added in 2004 and have seen some slower growth because they are newer programs.
Increased outreach by the college following the implementation of these programs aided a spike in graduate enrollment, Barua said.
The number of degrees awarded to graduate and undergraduate from the college showed a gap just before 2010, a jump in graduate degrees earned spiking years before the undergraduate followed suit, Barua said.
That issue is attributable to the fact that graduate students finish their degrees in two years, rather than the four and a half to six years it takes undergraduate students to receive their degrees on average, she added.
It has been difficult for the college to accommodate this new growth in enrollment, Unnikrishnan said, and the most pressing issue is space––the college does not have enough classroom space, laboratory or room for faculty research.
“Do we have the funding? Of course not,” Unnikrishnan said.
With more enrollment, however, comes more money and enrollment initially leads the way for more resources, he said.
The ECS college has proposed a project to increase space by closing in the bottom where the pillars and veranda are located. Bringing the walls down to obtain that space around the building would allow another 4,000-5,000 square feet of space.
The majority of funding for the college currently comes from grants provided by local industries, including General Electric and Southern California Edison, and alumni donations.
The Engineering and Computer Science Inter-Club Council is responsible for allocating funds received from Associated Students, Inc. Associated Students grants money to each of the university's inter-club councils for each college, and the councils then distribute the money to projects within the colleges.
Much of the funding the council receives goes to projects within the college, as well as travel for conferences and competitions that students attend, said Ivan Bernal, a mechanical engineering major and chair of the Engineering and Computer Science inter-club council.
Those conferences and competitions are one way the engineering and computer science students are able to get their names out there, across the CSU system and even across the nation, Bernal said.
“We are sending our top students to these competitions through funding from ASI and they're serious about these competitions, and they're winning first place, and second place,” Bernal said. “But the problem is our enrollment rate is going up and having more students, so its harder to get as many people involved and it's harder to send our best and our brightest out there.”
Seniors Michael Salas and Christian Simpson, both mechanical engineering majors, have seen significant growth in the program, with students, faculty and in senior projects.
“It's our last year and we see a lot more young engineers compared to when we were starting out,” Simpson said.
The college was recently ranked no. 16 in the nation for online master's programs in engineering–one spot ahead of Ivy League school Cornell.
Despite the challenges that come with growth of ECS, Unnikrishnan said they are dealing with the growth and it is a problem they are happy to have to address.
“These are the best of times––we have the problem for prosperity,” Unnikrishnan said.

The Hierarch is the fourth album by the French black metal band Hegemon and their first full-length in seven years. My comrade Leperkahn wrote about the first advance track from the album (here) in September, and today we bring you the premiere of a second one: “Credo Quia Absurdum“.
There is much about the song that summons images of a wolf pack tearing into its prey, with teeth flashing, blood spraying, and massed snarls splitting the air in a hair-raising frenzy. It's pure black metal savagery, replete with thundering drums and slashing riffs. But as good as Hegemon are at delivering sonic barbarism, that's only part of the exotic and esoteric adventure in this song.
The first sign that the song isn't simply a lethal dose of mayhem is the beautiful acoustic guitar introduction (which is reprised later in the track), and further signs come in the striking melody that emerges soon after the initial burst of thrashing ferocity, the dark majesty of the booming grooves that follow, and the array of differing vocals that accompany the dominant bestial ones.
A dynamic song and a very powerful and interesting one, “Credo Quia Absurdum” is the mature work of a band adept at harnessing different elements of a rich black tradition, the kind of music that's both energizing the first time you hear it and worth hearing again in order to consider more carefully each of its layers.
The Hierarch will be released by Season of Mist in North America on November 13 across multiple CD and LP formats, and it's available for pre-order here. And by the way, if you missed the first song to premiere from the album — “Interpreting Signs For War: Aruspicine” — you can listen to it via the Bandcamp stream below. Here's the complete track list:
1. Hatred From The Core: Tempus Incognito
2. Interpreting Signs For War: Aruspicine

While the media is currently focused on federal electoral reform, especially in light of Trudeau's recent backtracking on the issue, there is a lesser-known change taking place right here in Ontario. In an unprecedented move, the province recently revised the Municipal Elections Act to allow all local councils to use ranked ballots for their elections.
Canada currently holds the unenviable position as the only country in the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) that uses the first-past-the-post system — in which the candidate with the greatest number of votes wins, even if they only have, say 20 per cent support — for all of its elections, at all levels of government. This leads to distorted election results, can create governments that are not aligned with overall public opinion, and often forces citizens to vote strategically. It's a system that also encourages negative campaigns: Since candidates do not need a broad consensus in order to be elected, they often simply appeal to a smaller political base.
All these conditions only serve to feed a growing sense of cynicism about, frustration with and apathy towards our electoral system.
Ontario's 444 municipalities, however, now have the option of avoiding these issues and help Canada catch up to its peers, by switching to ranked ballots.
The truth is that there are many reasons for mayors and councillors to be reluctant to implement any kind of reform. Brampton's city council, for example, recently voted against ranked ballots — unanimously — with councillors citing concerns about the system being “too difficult” for voters to understand. This, despite the fact that Brampton's bylaws require its own city council to use a runoff system (which relies on the same premise as ranked ballots) when it has to appoint an interim councillor.
In other words: it's good enough for them, but not for us. It's simple enough for them to use, but not for us.
The uncomfortable truth politicians won't admit is that they don't like to change the systems that got them elected in the first place. Even if they once promoted reform, after being elected they become quite fond of the status quo. Let's call this what it is: self-serving opportunism.
Ranked ballots are, in fact, quite simple to explain and to use. In an election voters rank their choices in order of preference. A minimum threshold is set which candidates have to exceed in order to win. (For a single-winner race, like mayor, the threshold is 50 per cent). On the first round of voting, votes are counted using only the first-choice candidate on each ballot. If one candidate has passed the threshold, they win. If no candidate does, then the candidate with the fewest votes is dropped from the race and their votes are transferred to the second choice on each ballot. This process is repeated until someone passes the threshold.
Sound familiar? This is how the Liberal Party chooses its leader, and all of its local candidates. So does the Conservative Party, the NDP and the Greens.
Ranked ballots offer many benefits. First, they ensure that elected officials actually have the support of a majority of voters.
Ranked ballots also make it easier for anyone to run for office, without being accused of being a spoiler or a vote-splitter, and voters can correspondingly vote with their hearts rather than worrying about wasting their ballots — they can select a first-time or lesser-known candidate as their first choice, but then a frontrunner as their back-up second choice.
Candidates are more likely to run positive campaigns in ranked ballot systems, as they need to try to convince a broader pool of supporters, beyond their committed bases, to at least rank them second.
In a multi-member ward, or an at-large council, ranked ballots also provide proportionality, which would likely increase diversity on local councils that are currently dominated by white men. There is no doubt that our voting system is at least partially responsible for the under-representation of women and visible minorities across Ontario.
Of course, politicians can't admit they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, so they have come up with a whole menu of fabricated concerns about ranked ballots, none of which are accurate. Indeed, some of these worries border on the absurd.
We hear that ranked ballots are unfair, even though it is one of the most common voting systems in the world and is recommended by Robert's Rules of Order. Or we hear, as was the case in Brampton, that ranked ballots are just too complicated. Let's be clear: the insinuation is that some voters might have trouble counting to three. Not only is this incredibly patronizing, but it reveals a deep sense of superiority, since many councils use runoff elections themselves.
Three years ago, I hopped into a car with a few colleagues and we drove for 13 hours all the way to Minneapolis, to witness a ranked ballot election first-hand. We spent a week there, watching the final days of the election: interviewing voters, candidates, politicians and journalists. It was the city's second time using ranked ballots, and the reviews were universally positive. We were told, repeatedly, that the election campaigns were more positive, that the ballots were easy to use, that candidates reached out to communities that used to feel left out of the electoral process and that the candidates were focusing on substance rather than attacking each other's character.
We even produced a short video so voters in Ontario could see the benefits of ranked ballots by hearing directly from those who use them. On that Minneapolis election night, we witnessed the election of a female mayor, in addition to the city's first-ever Somali, Latina and Hmong councillors.
The door is open for Ontario's 444 municipalities, but who will walk through it first? Our councils are required to make a decision about whether to implement ranked ballots for the next election cycle before May 1, 2017. The next six months will reveal which councils are looking out for voters, and which are simply looking out for themselves.

Tropical Storm Colin may have flooded parts of Manatee County, but its wrath moved on Monday night.
“The storm will be well northeast of us by tomorrow, but lots of moisture is going to remain over the area,” John McMichael, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Monday evening. “That, along with daytime heating and a trough of low pressure, is going to combine to give us periods of rain during the day on and off. It's going to be a lot of tropical downpours and isolated thunderstorms throughout the remainder of the week.”
As of Monday evening, Colin had moved to the area just south of Apalachicola. McMichael said the tropical storm would head across north Florida and southeast Georgia overnight. Heavy rains from Colin were spreading across much of Florida, southern Georgia and South Carolina, according to a public advisory by the National Hurricane Center.
According to McMichael, Manatee and Sarasota counties were expected to see heavy rain on and off on Tuesday, with temperatures in the mid to upper 80s.

The storm delivered at least 2 inches of rain and 40 mph tropical storm force winds Monday, officials said.
Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for 34 counties in Florida due to Colin.
The Sunshine Skyway Bridge was closed at 11:15 a.m. due to winds of 52 mph at the top of the bridge. It remained closed as of 8 p.m. Monday.
Anna Maria Island, Longboat Key and other coastal areas in Manatee and Sarasota had significant rain overnight Sunday and throughout Monday.
On Monday evening, several roads on the island were flooded, including long stretches of Gulf Drive in Holmes Beach and Bradenton Beach. As motorists approached Bradenton Beach, a yellow sign along the sidewalk read: “STREET FLOODING DRIVE SLOW.”
A few brave souls leaned against the gusty winds just before 5 p.m. and walked onto Manatee Public Beach in Holmes Beach. Among them were Kelsey Robb, 23, and her uncle Rick Gutierrez, 47, of Peoria, Ill. They said they came to see the waves and feel the winds.
“It's awesome!” Robb said, her eyes squinting as large droplets fell. “It's intense... it's definitely impressive.”
Nearby, Sarasota resident Trish Cavanaugh stood at the beach holding her phone, her arm outstretched. She had just dropped off a friend on the island.
“I couldn't drive by without taking a look at the beach,” the smiling Cavanaugh added as her raincoat hood whipped furiously around her face. “It's pretty amazing.”
In Cortez, boats crashed against the Cortez Bridge as onlookers stood and watched. The U.S. Coast Guard in Cortez responded to several storm-related calls Monday, according to U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Eric Woodall. The calls included helping two adults and a 5-year-old out of a disabled vessel near Bradenton Beach, and assisting an elderly man whose vessel was pushed onto shallow water after getting hit by two other vessels in the area of Jewfish Key.
There was flooding in the Rubonia neighborhood north of Palmetto, and Anna Maria Island experienced on-and-off bouts of rain on Monday, but the gulf was in constant motion. Around 8:30 a.m., cars started to pile into the Anna Maria Island public works sandbag station, where residents can come to fill as many bags as they need to protect their homes from flooding. Some parts of Gulf Drive were submerged as cars created wakes, splashing dark water onto sidewalks and lawns.
The weather didn't deter beachgoers. While a red flag fluttered at the Manatee Public Beach lifeguard stand, residents and visitors alike took selfies, searched for shells and enjoyed the sound of the waves.
Former resident Sara Dasher said it beat sitting inside and staring at each other, as she watched her husband Blake push their 18-month-old daughter Shelby on the swings at the beach.
Seagulls and sandpipers danced on the sand, evading the constant flux of foamy waves. Some of those waves washed over sea turtle nests, but only time will tell what happens to the eggs.
Suzi Fox, executive director of AMI Turtle Watch, said that it's illegal to handle turtle eggs and dangerous to be on the beach during a storm. Turtle Watch volunteers aren't even allowed to be on the beach to monitor nests during storms like Colin.
“It's heartwrenching,” Fox said. A beachgoer might think they're doing good by saving a turtle egg, but Fox said doing so would skew data about nesting.
“It's best to leave nature alone,” she said.
It appeared that Colin was a one-day event for Manatee, with conditions improving overnight.
Although there has been no river flooding yet, that is a concern for Tuesday and Wednesday, said Don Hermey, Manatee County's Emergency Management Chief.
“We will be checking river gauges,” Hermey said. “Winds of this speed are capable of causing old branches and to come down and, if there is a super saturation of the ground, a tree could be uprooted. A big concern is going to be rip tides and beach erosion.”

Think about “the end of Europe.” Do you suppose it is more likely that such a thing will be brought on by military aggression à la Russia's de facto annexation of Ukraine, or by the TV appearance of a bearded singer performing in drag?
I ask because
Victory for Austria's bearded transvestite Conchita Wurst at the Eurovision Song Contest prompted an outpouring of anti-gay anger from Russian politicians and stars on Sunday. … “There's no limit to our outrage. It's the end of Europe. It has turned wild. They don't have men and women any more. They have ‘it',” nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky told Rossiya-1 state television.
In case you're not familiar with the Eurovision Song Contest, it's an annual sing-off in which countries compete for the cheesiest best song and overall presentation. Each country's jury awards points to all contestants but its own. It has been a famously ridiculous entertainment extravaganza for decades, a large percentage of viewers tuning in with a kind of tongue-in-cheek appreciation for the inherent campiness and gaudiness of the event.
One measure of how nutso the Eurovision Song Contest is: Israel, which has of course never been a part of Europe, is a frequent participant , while Turkey, which at least is partially located on European soil, is not.
Anyway, Russians in high places are appalled by Conchita Wurst‘s win.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin wrote on Twitter that the Eurovision result “showed supporters of European integration their European future: a bearded girl.” … “Fifty years ago the Soviet army occupied Austria. We made a mistake in freeing Austria. We should have stayed,” added the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, known for his outrageous statements.
Good to know that in terms of hateful invective, American politicians and pundits have nothing on their Russian counterparts.
By the way, it probably didn't help that Russia's entry, the Tolmachevy Sisters, only came in at number seven.
As the festive period is here once again, a lot of social gatherings and family time are part of the itinerary for most. So this year instead of telling the regular old Christmas cracker jokes why not entertain your friends and family with these pretty amazing space facts instead?
There are thousands of other planets out there.
We have eight planets in our Solar System. However, outside of our Solar System there are thousands of other planets. The extra-solar planets or exo-planets are in orbit around another star. So far we have almost 1800 confirmed new worlds, with another 3000 awaiting confirmation. Astronomers are looking to a star's goldilocks zone for planets that may be habitable, just like the Earth. The majority of planets discovered so far are hot gas giant planets.
2. In space the skin on your feet peels off!
This is a pretty gross fact but in the micro-gravity environment, astronauts are not using their feet to walk. Therefore the skin on their feet starts to soften and flakes off. As laundry facilities do not exist in space, astronauts will wear the same underwear and socks for a few days. Those socks then need to be taken off very gently. If not those dead skin cells will float around in the weightless environment.
3. On Venus a day is longer than a year.
This is tricky one to get your head around but a year on Venus (that is the length of time it takes to complete one whole orbit around the Sun) is 224.7 Earth days. However it takes 243 Earth days to rotate on its axis just once.
4.The astronauts were placed in quarantine after returning from the moon.
There is a famous image of President Nixon talking to the Apollo 11 crew consisting of Michael Collins, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. This continued until after the Apollo 14 crew returned safely. After this it was decided that the Moon did not contain any deadly diseases. The Apollo 13 crew, who had a malfunction and had to return to Earth, did not have to be quarantined after their re-entry as they didn't actually walk on the moon.
5. One million Earths can fit inside the Sun.
Ancient astronomers once believed the Earth was at the centre of the Universe but now we know that the Sun is at the centre of our Solar System and our planets orbit the Sun. The Sun makes up 99.8% of the entire mass of the whole Solar System. One million Earths would be needed to be the same size as the Sun.
6.You become taller in Space.
Another change to the human body in micro-gravity is that spine straightens out, as gravity is not pushing you down. In fact you can be up to as much as 5cm taller in the Space Station.
7. Extreme weather warning!
Some times on the Earth, especially here in Northern Ireland the weather can be a bit rubbish! However our weather is awesome compared to some of the other planets. Jupiter has fast winds and the Great Red spot, a massive hurricane style storm, has raged there for the last 300 years. Mercury and Mars have extreme temperature changes in the same day. Venus is a scorching five times hotter than boiling water. Saturn and Uranus also have extremely fast winds. However Neptune has the fastest ever wind speeds reaching a staggering 1600mph!
8. Space is not that far away.
Space officially begins at the universal marker of the Karman Line. This invisible boundary is 100km above the Earth. In theory if you could drive your car upwards, you could be in space in less than hour.
9. The hottest planet is not the closest planet to the Sun.
Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not actually the hottest. Mercury does not have any atmosphere meaning that this planet is only hot in the daytime when it is directly facing the Sun. At this stage temperatures can rise to 425°C but at night the planet's temperature can drop down to a freezing -180°C. Venus is the hottest planet. Its thick clouds trap the Sun's heat causing Venus to be a sizzling 500°C all of the time!
10. The moon looks bigger on the horizon
There is an optical illusion which makes the moon appear to be larger the lower it is in the sky. The apparent magnification is not caused by our atmosphere. It is more of a mind trick. When the moon is closer to the horizon, it is closer to objects like buildings and trees which therefore in comparison makes the moon look bigger. However there are times when the moon really is bigger. During its elliptical orbit the moon has times when it is actually slightly closer to the Earth (Perigee) or further from the Earth (apogee). This happens about once a month, due the moon's orbit around the Earth. Usually is not noticeable to the eye. However when a full moon occurs at the same time of the moon's perigee it can be called a supermoon and appears 12-14% bigger than normal!
11. There's a moose loose
Eccentric Astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) believed that the Moon and Sun orbited the Earth but the other planets orbited the Sun. He catalogued many stars and objects, and has a crater on the moon, and supernova remnant named after him. However his wild antics are perhaps just as interesting. He wore a fake silver nose after losing his real one in a sword fight and he also had a pet moose which died falling down the stairs after one to many drinks. When his body was exhumed and examined in 2010, it is thought that a burst bladder was the cause of his death not mercury poisoning by a jealous colleague which was considered a cause of death.Astronauts are literally star sailors
12. The word astronaut comes from the Greek word “Astron” which means star and “nautes” which means sailor. The Russian cosmonaut has a similar meaning from ‘kosmos' meaning universe and again “nautes” sailor.
13. You can cry in space but your tears don't fall
On-board the International Space Station, water floats like bubbles or spheres. However the water will cling to a surface until it is dislodged. This means that tears start to form bubbles around your eyes as the weightless environment is not causing your tears to fall. This sounds really cool but it can be dangerous. ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano suffered a space suit leak whilst on a spacewalk. The water leaked into his helmet covered his eyes and ears, but thankfully he made it back into the Space Station unharmed, but if not he could have drowned in space.
14. Dirty underwear and toilet paper has helped grown plants on the ISS
American astronaut Don Pettit discovered that by folding a pair of underpants into a sphere shape and stitching in some Russian toilet paper (which is thick, wool like gauze), this created a warmer environment for some tomato and basil seeds to start to sprout. Like their socks, underwear is only changed every 3-4 days so he figured the pants might provide some extra nutrients for the plants!
15. There is a dwarf planet named after an Easter island legend
Dwarf planet Makemake was discovered at Easter 2005. The Easter Island Moai figures were the inspiration for its name. Makemake in Rapa Nui mythology was the creator of humanity and the god of fertility. He is also a feature in many rock and cave drawings on the island.
16. Nebulae come in all shapes and sizes
Nebula means cloud in Latin. These are areas in which stars are being created or where a star has died. The cosmic clouds come in all shapes and sizes and are made out of interstellar dust and gases. There is a Christmas tree nebula, a horsehead, a unicorn, a hand, fried egg and lots more. These beautiful clouds which are not visible to the naked eye really highlight the fact there is a lot more happening in the night sky than you can see.
17. The North Star will change…eventually
The North Star used for navigation, a steady point in the night sky will change, however not in our lifetime. The Earth is rotating like a spinning top and therefore the pole of our planet wobbles. Currently it points to Polaris but in the year 13727 our Pole Star will be the star Vega, in the constellation of Lyra. Vega was the also North Star in 12000BCE.
18. The Apollo crews did not have any life insurance.
On the chance that the 3-man crew of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins did not return safely from the moon, they were not covered by any life insurance policy. So before their trip all 3 men signed photographs that could be sold in the event of their death. These Insurance covers were also stamped and posted on the start date of the mission, July 16th 1969 by a friend.
19. In space metal sticks together
In a vacuum like space, when two pieces of metal touch each other they bond together. This is a process called cold welding. On the Earth because of the oxygen in our environment this does not happen naturally but it is used during some manufacturing processes. It is something to take into account but it is not usually a problem as the astronaut's tools maintain an oxide layer even when leaving Earth.
20. The furthest manmade object is Voyager 1. It has messages for aliens on-board.
In 1977, Voyager 1 and 2 were launched. Their primary mission was to visit Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 continued onto Uranus and Neptune; Voyager 1 has now made its way into interstellar space. Voyager 1 is further away from Earth than the distance between the Sun and Pluto. Both craft carry a golden record on board, which will act like a time-capsule of Earth. It has greetings from Earth as well as different kinds of music. It also has noises of rocket engines, the sea, people talking, animal's sounds and lots of images. All of which sum up the Earth. United States President Jimmy Carter said at the time “This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe.” These messages have been recorded as electronic impulses which can be translated into written words. If any aliens find it then can enjoy some Louis Armstrong as well some Peruvian panpipes!
Wanted to hear what's on the golden record , have a listen to this .
I hope you have enjoyed these weird and wonderful facts about space or why not also add these to your Christmas repertoire of jokes.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Martina Redpath, Senior Education Support Officer
We know prisons are racist, classist and abusive. Are they also obsolete?
pris•on ab•o•li•tion
noun
1. The dismantling of the prison system; the end of coerced confinement as punishment
2. The construction of alternatives to prison and of a world that disincentivizes violence
“While there is a lower class I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.” —Socialist Eugene V. Debs, in a statement to the court after being convicted of sedition in 1918.
Don't Prisons Keep People Safe?
Whatever politicians might say, abolitionists argue that the current prison-industrial complex isn't designed to solve crime—after all, three-quarters of people released from prison are rearrested within five years—but rather to warehouse the poor, drug addicted and mentally ill. And there's a racial element as well: Black Americans are around five times more likely than whites to find themselves behind bars, often for minor offenses, while many who pose a bigger threat to society get Oscars, golden parachutes and seats in Congress. Why Not Just Make Prisons Better? It's true that not all prisons are as sadistic as Uncle Sam's: In Norway, for example, the incarcerated wear street clothes, pick berries, cook meals and have relative freedom to move about the grounds. But many prison abolitionists believe that depriving humans of liberty is fundamentally cruel. Social scientists such as Gresham M. Sykes—not to mention many incarcerated people themselves—have long documented how the loss of one's place in society, physical safety and autonomy can cause severe long-term psychological problems. Still, Isn't Prison Abolition Utopic? Utopic need not be a slur, but the idea is less out there than it may seem. As Angela Davis explains in Are Prisons Obsolete?, imprisonment only became a catch-all punishment in what's now the United States around the American Revolution. Other means of conflict resolution aren't just possible, but the historical norm. Okay, So … What Do We Do With All The Criminals? The abolitionist first might challenge the word “criminal,” observing that it's often racialized, and call to decriminalize “crimes” like drug use, for example. They might also advocate full employment, well-funded public education, drug treatment programs and adequate mental healthcare, all of which help address causes of illegal activity; digging out the social and economic roots of gendered violence would be crucial as well. Prison abolitionist organizations such as Critical Resistance support initiatives like community gardens to build social cohesion. And while instances of rape and murder won't vanish entirely, societies worldwide are experimenting with restorative justice: non-carceral efforts at repairing harm done to individuals and communities. This is part of “The Big Idea,” a monthly series offering brief introductions to progressive theories, policies, tools and strategies that can help us envision a world beyond capitalism. For recent In These Times coverage of prison abolition, see, “Trial by Peace Circle: How a Chicago Community Is Pursuing Jail-Free Justice,” “To End Mass Incarceration, We Must Rethink How We Respond to Violence” and “Meet the LGBTQ Prison Abolitionists Leading the Way to a Better World.”
A man is behind bars after he allegedly abused an elderly couple who allowed him inside their home.
Investigators say an 83-year-old woman and her 85-year-old husband allowed 55-year-old William Miller to move into their home on the 3900 block of North Percy Street in Philadelphia during the winter of 2009.
According to police, Miller was homeless at the time and the couple allowed him to move in with them under the condition that he would help them around the house.
Investigators say that in 2011, Miller began to physically assault the couple, beginning a cycle of abuse that would last for three years. Miller allegedly beat the 83-year-old woman on a monthly basis and her husband on a daily basis. Police say Miller repeatedly asked the couple for money and would beat them whenever they refused.
According to officials, the 85-year-old man suffered from medical conditions but Miller would attack him anyway.
Police say the last incident occurred a few weeks ago when Miller punched the elderly woman in the face several times, causing swelling. Miller allegedly threatened to kill the couple if they ever tried to tell police about the abuse.
Police say the elderly man was taken to Temple University Hospital back on Easter Sunday after a recent assault by Miller. Police were notified which sparked their investigation.
Miller was arrested on Thursday and charged with Attempted Murder, Aggravated Assault, Robbery and other related offenses. Investigators say Miller had three prior arrests for burglary and narcotics.
Police continue to investigate.
So, Richard Trumka, how worried are you about the inroads Donald Trump made into your membership, and a future in which an anti-free trade Republican Party makes significant inroads into the union vote?
I sat with the AFL-CIO president recently in his office just up the street from the White House to talk about the impact its current occupant is having on the union's steadily shrinking but still formidable membership of 12 million workers. Trump got 36 percent of his members' votes against Hillary Clinton. That's only three points more than Mitt Romney, but three points isn't anything in a close election. And as Trumka emphasized to me, it wasn't only or even chiefly that Trump did better than Romney. Clinton, he wanted me to know, did worse than Obama—10 points worse, snaring just 55 percent of his rank-and-file's vote. The rest went third party or sat it out.
So is he worried that Trump can bust up the traditional Democratic-labor marriage? “Actually less each day,” he tells me. “The Wall Street wing of his administration is hijacking his agenda.” We spoke before the White House's announcement Wednesday that it was going to rethink NAFTA, so that has probably placated Trumka somewhat. But he pointed to Trump's about-face on China and currency manipulation and the fact that the president hasn't talked up infrastructure in a very long time as discouraging signs.
His posture toward Trump is not one of total opposition. He's skeptical and suspicious, certainly. In addition to thinking Trump has gone Wall Street as president, Trumka fears that Trump will gut labor safety regulations and thinks he probably can't bring jobs back to the coal fields in huge numbers. That said, he's mindful of the fact that Trump spoke compellingly to a portion of his rank and file, so he's keeping a semi-open mind. “We're just telling [members] every day what he's doing to help them or hurt them,” he says. “If he does something to help 'em I say it. If he does something to hurt 'em I say it. They can decide for themselves who's friend and who's foe.”
We spent more of our 50 minutes together talking about the Democrats than we did about Trump. He didn't want to lay into Hillary Clinton personally, but he did point out to me that fact about her doing less well among his members than Obama had, and he had some sharp words for the Democratic message in last year's campaign—and for Bill Clinton.
“The Democratic Party quite frankly had no coherent economic message,” he said. “Workers have been facing stagnant wages, dropping benefits, and economic security being taken away from them over a 40-year period. Trump said a lot of stuff—hasn't followed through on it, but said it, and they were willing to take a chance.”
The problems, he said, started under Bill Clinton. “I think that was the beginning of the schizophrenic days, when they needed workers' votes but wanted Wall Street money, so they tried to serve two masters but were successful at neither,” says Trumka.
But didn't Bill Clinton do a number of good things? I mean, 22 million jobs?
“People still weren't getting wage increases,” he says. “The economy was still moving away from us.”
And what of Barack Obama?
Slight pause, then: “A well-intentioned guy. I think he had a good heart. You have to put him in context. He had a Congress determined not to let him do anything. They spooked him early on… It's not like he had a fair chance on the playing field. He could have done more workers, but all in all, he tried.”
Not exactly high praise (he also mentioned his disappointment that Obama didn't speak more consistently about—or do more to fight—wage stagnation and inequality). So surely, President Trumka, you're happy with the direction the Democratic Party has taken since November?
“Look, you can't beat something with nothing,” he says. “If you don't have an economic message that resonates with working people you're not gonna win. That's why people like Sherrod Brown and a number of other people running in the same difficult environment that presidential candidates run in succeed. They have a consistent economic message that people know they can believe.”
He mentioned Brown again—both times were unprompted—just a few minutes later. Was he dropping a hint about 2020? No, said Trumka, he's just a friend, someone with solid economic credentials, who represents a lot of his members, and has proven that a Democrat can win in a pretty conservative state by being clear and forthright about kitchen-table economics. That is true, though it should be noted that Brown has won only one statewide election, in the high-Democratic turnout year of 2012. He's up again this year, just two years after Trump pummeled Clinton in Ohio. (The three other names Trumka dropped, unbidden: senators Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Jeff Merkley).
[UPDATE: I was wrong here. Brown has won two statewide elections, having first been elected to the Senate in 2006.]
Speaking more generally about the future and what the Democrats need to do, Trumka is straightforward. “Actually if they would just run on the [2016] platform,” he says. “And mean it. We had a wonderful progressive platform that spoke to the issues of working people. Run on the platform and make it happen. Stick to it.”
But aren't social and cultural issues a big boulder for the Democratic Party in places like southeastern Ohio, which Brown represents in the Senate, or southwestern Pennsylvania, where he grew up, or Morgantown, West Virginia, where I grew up, about 25 miles downriver from his hometown of Nemacolin? (He and my father knew each other, incidentally, as both were involved with the anti-corruption reform movement in the United Mine Workers.) He said he doesn't really think so. Of course Democrats from different parts of the country have to run differently on social issues, he says, but he remains convinced that for all the headlines cultural conflicts generate, when the the vast majority of people get in the voting booth, they're thinking about their economic prospects.
“The economic message should hold everybody together,” he says, “so that when you say ‘this person's a Democrat,' three or four things come to mind. And it shouldn't be this or that social issue, it should be economics.”
The idea he's pushing these days is collective bargaining for everyone, even people who aren't in a union. This sounds crazy maybe at first blush. But here are the facts. First of all, it's not illegal or anything. There's nothing in U.S. labor law that prevents workers at any American workplace, provided they can demonstrate that they represent a majority of the workforce, from going to the boss and demanding wage and other concessions. It's about a jillion light years removed from American tradition. But there's nothing to prevent it happening (and, of course, nothing requiring a boss to honor such demands). It's the only thing, Trumka argues, that can put upward pressure on wages.
Trumka is 67 and has headed the AFL-CIO for nearly eight years now. He won't do this forever. He surely expected, as everyone else did, that he'd be working with Democratic presidents for the rest of his career. Now he has to worry about whether the Department of Labor is going to strip away OSHA and MSHA (mining) safety regulations, whether some of his Hispanic members (there are around 2 million of them) might get deported, and who knows what else. Maybe if a Sherrod Brown-like Democrat is the nominee next time, Trumka will throw heart and soul into making sure the country changes course again—and making sure his members are a crucial part of it and will be due some reward for its efforts.
UltraMFCD for DCS. Click, drag, resize and enhance DCS avionics.
Zero configuration/modding required.
NEWSFLASH - Support for Su-25T, Su-27, Su-33, Mig29A/G/S & F-15C now included
See UltraMFCD in action There's quite a lot of information on this site. Just watch UltraMFCD in action.
Fully interactive displays The ability to export MFCDs has been available in Digital Combat Simulator for some time. UltraMFCD takes these to a new level by enabling the pilot to drag and resize the MFCD exports (MFCD, CDU , RWR) in real-time - allowing a layout of one's tactical systems which suits the circumstances - in addition to making the screens themselves clickable so as to reduce overall screen clutter. Never before has the interaction with your aricraft's computer systems been as immersive, intuitive and interactive.
Full Multiplayer support UltraMFCD works in both single-player and multi-player, including servers where integrity check in enabled. (Note: Certain server admins may disallow the "Colour LITENING CCD" option.)
Zero Configuration UltraMFCD requires absolutely no configuration or editing of DCS's configuration files. Simply run UltraMFCD and sit back while DCS is configured for display exports totally automatically. UltraMFCD will remember the configuration each MFD between flights, allowing the pilot to concentrate on flying as opposed to system configuration.
Multi-monitor support UltraMFCD's displays can be dragged freely to any display connected to your computer - even those on which DCS is not running. The rule is simple: If Windows is aware of the monitor, you can freely drag one or more UltraMFCD displays there.
Touchscreen MFCDs To save valuable screen space, OSBs are integrated in to the display screen itself, granting the pilot as uninterrupted view as possible of the rest of the simulator's world.
4K rendering UltraMFCD exports can be rendered up to 4K quality independently of screen size/resolution in DCS.
Optional colour LITENING sensor Rafael Advanced Defence Systems - the manufacturer of the A-10C's LITENING pod - announced that they would offer a colour CCD sensor as a retrofit option for all LITENING pods by the end on 2014. With UltraMFCD you too can enjoy this upgrade.
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Hundreds of youths have set fire to cars and attacked police and rescue services in poor immigrant suburbs in three nights of rioting in Stockholm, Sweden's worst disorder in years.
On Tuesday night, a police station in the Jakobsberg area in the northwest of the city was attacked, two schools were damaged and an arts and crafts center was set ablaze, despite a call for calm from Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.
The riots in one of Europe's richest capitals have shocked a country that prides itself on a reputation for social justice, and fuelled a debate about how Sweden is coping with both youth unemployment and an influx of immigrants.
“We've had around 30 cars set on fire last night, fires that we connect to youth gangs and criminals,” Kjell Lindgren, spokesman for Stockholm police, said on Wednesday.
He said eight people had been arrested on Tuesday night, but there were no reports of injuries.
The riots appear to have been sparked by the police killing of a 69-year-old man wielding a machete in the suburb of Husby this month, which prompted accusations of police brutality.
“Everyone must pitch in to restore calm - parents, adults,” Reinfeldt told reporters on Tuesday.
After decades of practicing the “Swedish model” of generous welfare benefits, Sweden has been reducing the role of the state since the 1990s, spurring the fastest growth in inequality of any advanced OECD economy.
While average living standards are still among the highest in Europe, governments have failed to substantially reduce long-term youth unemployment and poverty, which have affected immigrant communities worst.
The left-leaning tabloid Aftonbladet said the riots represented a “gigantic failure” of government policies, which had underpinned the rise of ghettos in the suburbs.
“We have failed to give many of the people in the suburbs a hope for the future,” Anna-Margrethe Livh of the opposition Left Party wrote in the daily Svenska Dagbladet.

An anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats, has risen to third in polls ahead of a general election due next year, reflecting unease about immigrants among many voters.
Some 15 percent of the population is foreign-born, the highest proportion in the Nordic region. Unemployment among those born outside Sweden stands at 16 percent, compared with 6 percent for native Swedes, according to OECD data.
Among 44 industrialized countries, Sweden ranked fourth in the absolute number of asylum seekers, and second relative to its population, according to U.N. figures.
Most valuable language
First, we need to know how many posts identified languages used. I ran this against the last two years of data, and found that there were 7845 posts flagged [OC], and the algorithm above identified the language(s) used in 4189 of them.Next, we can do a simple comparison of languages usages vs posts that specified languages, and that's where you get the post at the beginning (% = 100*(posts specifying this language/posts specifying any language)):Note that the numbers above add up to >100% because some posts specified multiple languages (511 of the 4189 posts with identifiable languages).And that's the original goal. It's clear that Excel wins by a landslide. I guess it makes sense because almost everyone can use Excel and it's really quick to get plots out. Python dominating MATLAB surprised me at first but makes sense in retrospect since MATLAB is not free and has fewer users (it's just really great for working with data).To make it interesting, I wanted to see if any languages predicted more success on reddit. I tried doing that a few different ways. A simple one is to get the average score per post per language:That looks odd. We can't assume post scores have a normal distribution though, so another test is using medians:That's a huge disparity between median and average. How weird is the distribution? A histogram with logarithmic bins yields:That is much clearer to me. One interesting thing is that it spikes up in the 3 to 10 thousand score range, so I'm guessing that's when a post makes it to the front page maybe? An idea then is to look at the score distributions by language:It's pretty clear from this that excel is more bottom heavy than some of the others.

After a football free Saturday due to 25 de Mayo celebrations, Sunday was crammed with 5 games and the top 3 all in action and it was Lanus who were the biggest losers. Despite still being unbeaten before yesterday the cracks had started to show in Lanus' performances and yesterday afternoon the wheels finally fell off as they were swept aside in San Juan, by San Martin. The 3-1 defeat was the first of the campaign and now they find themselves 4 points off the pace with 4 games to play. With Lanus losing, River Plate momentarily went top after they comfortably beat Atletico Rafaela in the Estadio Monumental, 3 first half goals blasted away their inferior opposition as River put in one of their best performances of the season easing to a 3-0 win(with 4 to play it could be a great time to be hitting form!). Their time at the summit lasted only a couple of hours as Newell's thrashed Boca Juniors. Understandably both sides fielded weakened sides due to this being sandwiched in between their Copa Libertadores Quarter Final but it was Newell's who showed their title credentials in demolishing a woeful Boca side and keeping their championship hopes alive despite cup commitments. In the earlier games, Independiente travelled to Cordoba and earned draw with Belgrano, which could be a valuable point in their bid to avoid relegation, provided Argentinos Juniors lose tonight and Racing drew 1-1 with Godoy Cruz in Avellaneda. ALL THE REPORTS AND GOALS HERE….
BELGRANO 0 – 0 INDEPENDIENTE
Ordinarily a point in Cordoba would be a pretty decent result given Belgrano's home form, as would go 5 games without defeat but this is no ordinary time for Independiente. They will now be watching Argentinos Juniors trip to La Plate tonight, where they play Estudiantes, very closely. There was not a great deal to report from the game itself as chances were few and far between and any slight sniffs were usually wasted. Independiente still holding some hope and have now only 4 games to save their status in the top flight.
RACING CLUB 1 – 1 GODOY CRUZ
Both sides battling for qualification to the Copa Sudamericana and it was Racing who will be the happier side after Godoy Cruz only left Avellaneda with a point. Goalkeeper, Sebastian Saja gave Racing the lead form the penalty spot just before half time but Godoy Cruz came back strongly and forced an equaliser just after the hour mark, a fine left footed finish from inside the box by Jose Luis Fernandez.
SAN MARTIN 3 – 1 LANUS
For the first time under manager Guillermo Schelotto, Lanus conceded 3 goals and for the first time were beaten which could signal the end of their title aspirations. Their early season form seems a distant memory now and the misfiring performances of recent weeks, where they have been drawing games finally caught up with them. For San Martin, still deep in the midst of a relegation dogfight this is another valuable victory. They took the lead early when Gaston Caprari was quickest to react to a freekick that was blocked by the wall and he smashed his effort into the roof of the net. Lanus equalised when Fernando Barrientos fired in from range but the day belonged to San Martin. After 70 minutes San Martin were gifted the lead when Agustin Marchesin fumbled a straight-forward take from a high ball, allowing Damian Ledesma to tap in. However, Ledesma was then shown a second yellow card for his celebration and in the space of a minute went from goal scoring hero to red card villian. However, it mattered not as Claudio Riaño put the result beyond doubt with 2 minutes to go.
RIVER PLATE 3 – 0 ATLETICO RAFAELA
River came out of the traps quickly last night and blew away Atletico Rafaela in 30 minutes. Lionel Vangioni's fine left footed strike as he cut in from the left and found the top corner from 25 yards gave them the lead after just 7 minutes and it was soon two when Rafaela centre half, Eduardo Dominguez haplessly deflected a driven cross into his own net. After 30 minutes, Carlos Luna headed in Juan Iturbe's cross from the right and it was game over. River seems to have found some form at a key stage in the season and midfield anchor, Cristian Ledesma has been central to that. His dominance in the midfield last night is key to River's possession and the source of their moves and his reemergence in the side is something that Ramon Diaz should get credit for.
NEWELL'S OLD BOYS 4 – 0 BOCA JUNIORS
On Thursday night these two sides played out a tense 0-0 draw in La Bombonera during the first leg of their Copa Libertadores quarter final and on Wednesday they will do it again in Rosario. Last night's game in Rosario did not quite have that edge as Newell's second string battered Boca Juniors reserves. Newell's led early after Paulo Cruzado was brought down by stand-in Boca keeper, Sebastian D'Angelo and he got up to convert the spot kick after just 7 minutes. On the stroke of half time it went from bad to worse when young centre back, Lisandro Migallan was sent off. In the second half, free scoring Newell's ran riot: First, Horacio Orzan's long range effort squirmed past D'Angelo, then 2 minutes later Martin Tonso made it 3 before Maxi Urriti completed the 5 minute blitz with the fourth. Despite not being a regular starter for Newell's Urriti leads the clubs assist charts proving his value to the side. Newell's have now scored 14 goals in their past 4 home games which makes good reading going into their Libertadores match with Boca and they now sit 3 points clear of second placed River at the top of the table.

A 38 North exclusive with analysis by Joseph S. Bermudez Jr., Jack Liu and Frank Pabian.
After almost eight weeks of elevated activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, commercial satellite imagery from April 16 indicates little activity around the North Portal, the tunnel that North Korea appears to have been preparing for another nuclear test. Imagery does show what may be three volleyball games underway at different locations throughout the facility, and possibly another volleyball net set up at the command center area.[1]
At the North Portal, the pumping of water out of the tunnel to maintain an optimal environment for instrumentation and stemming seems to have ceased. This could mean that the tunnel has been completely sealed or that the North may have installed drainage pipes instead of using open ditches. The vehicles or trailers that were previously observed near the portal or on nearby roads are gone. Three mining carts are present on the spoil pile and there appears to have been some minor dumping of material there in the past few days.
Based on available imagery, the status of the test site remains unclear. While activities over the past few weeks are similar to those seen prior to previous tests, possible explanations for the most recent developments are:
The site and associated preparations for a sixth nuclear test have transitioned to a “stand-by” status, with personnel being allowed some down-time for recreation. Since the North Koreans are aware of when commercial satellites will fly overhead, the presence of personnel at play (with what looks like the normal six players on each side) may be a way of signaling that a decision has been made to place the test on hold.[2]
Pyongyang has initiated a tactical pause in activity at the test site as part of an overall deception plan, delaying the sixth nuclear test until a time when a detonation would achieve the greatest political advantage. The North has engaged in such practices in the past. The most notable instance was the satellite launch from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in December 2012, when North Korean press reported technical problems with the Unha space launch vehicle after it was loaded onto the launch pad, but then proceeded to launch it the next day.
Regardless, satellite imagery continues to indicate that the Punggye-ri nuclear test site appears able to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time once the order is received from Pyongyang.

[1] Volleyball is a popular sport in North Korea and satellite imagery often identifies games in progress throughout the nation. Personnel playing volleyball at the Punggye-ri nuclear test facility have also been identified on a number of occasions as far back as 2006 after the first nuclear test and more recently in February. To date, however, there have been no instances of three concurrent volleyball games.

If our side were well funded and well organized, as warmists charge, it would have the following 22 characteristics–which it doesn't.
Guest post by Roger Knights
Along with falsely claiming to be a Nobel Prize Recipient, climate “hockey stick' promoter Dr. Michael Mann is often fond of saying:
“There has been, for years now, a very well-organized and frankly well-funded effort to confuse the public about climate change.”
Brian Martin, in his wonderful online booklet Strip the Experts, wrote that if your opponents:
“have a financial interest in what they are promoting, exposing it can be very damaging.”
This line of attack on skeptics has been very successful for the warmists in the past, which is why they constantly recur to it. But the recent skeptical attack has been mostly an indignant, blogger-led populist revolt against increased and unnecessary taxation and regulation (fewer barbecues, etc.) and against elitist presumption.
If our side were well funded and well organized, it would have the following characteristics:
1. There'd be a slick umbrella site like HuffPo under which all dissident bloggers could shelter, cutting their costs, increasing ad revenue, and simplifying and standardizing the process of surfing the deviationist blogosphere, especially for visiting journalists. The effect would be to considerably “amplify” the dissenters' voices.
2. Failing that, there'd be enough $ for individual sites to ensure that, for instance, Climate Audit would have been able to handle to traffic-surge in the wake of Climategate, instead of being overwhelmed. (How does that unpreparedness agree with “well organized”?)
3. Commenters would be compensated for accessing paywalled articles. Instead, virtually every thread on WUWT that critiques a warmist paper laments its paywalled status and critiques only what is outside the paywall.
4. There'd be a copy editing & peer review service to vet our side's books prior to publication, since any flubs will be seized on by warmists to discredit the entire work, as happened to Plimer's book. Instead, dissenting books continue to be produced in an amateurish fashion. For instance, in Steve Goreham's just-out (and excellent) Climatism!, I found two obvious spelling errors in just an hour's skimming. (“Forego” for “forgo” and “principle” used where “principal” was needed.)
5. There'd be a PR agency to “package” stories emerging from the blogosphere and articles in scientific journals or contrarian columnists and feed them to media sources in easy-to-read, pre-edited form. (Or at least an unincorporated online network of funded individuals performing a PR function.) This is a topic that is so complex and filled with jargon that it desperately needs such pre-chewing to get the MSM to swallow it. But what do we have? Only Climate Depot, which provides leads, but no packaging.
As Mike Haseler wrote, “it's blatantly obvious to me that the press need to be fed stories almost ready for publication, you can't expect them to take highly technical writing and try and make sense of it!”
BTW, another contra-factual is Climategate. There was no pre-planned media-coordination involved in the matter. There was no campaign to alert them to its importance, nor any professional packaging of the story for them. No one gave Fox a heads-up. As a result, MSM coverage of the event was nil.
(As for the idea that the leak was “timed” to disrupt Copenhagen, that's equally absurd. The story gained no MSM coverage at all for the first two weeks, because that's how long it took to ascertain that the e-mails were legit and to untangle the rat's nest of e-mails and shed some light on them and the Read_Me file. It took about four weeks for the scandal to really heat up, with outraged commentary finally appearing in some middle-of-the-road venues. Any professional media consultant would have advised leaking the documents six to eight weeks earlier than Nov. 20. By that time, attendees' reservations and trip-plans were cast in concrete.)
6. There'd be a centralized, regularly updated, annotated, topically divided, web-wide index of useful “ammo” skeptical or skeptic-supporting articles. If I, or anyone, were cat-herder in chief, this would be one of the top items on the agenda.
7. There'd be a REPOSITORY for “quotes of the day” from blog commenters. (These get lost in the noise after a week or so otherwise.) Here's an example, from Willis:
“First, my thanks to all the prospective henchdudes and henchbabes out there, a map to my hollow volcano lair will be emailed to you as soon as I get one. Well-funded mercilessness roolz! I demand a volcano lair!”
8. There'd be extensive book tours for every skeptical book published, to gain exposure in multiple markets via interviews in the local press, etc. Such tours could be extended for many months, well beyond any rational “payback” in book sales, if the real aim were to get media exposure – for instance by challenging local warmists to debates on the premises of the newspaper or broadcaster, etc. The funding for such a tour could easily be concealed.
9. There'd be an astro-turfed tag-team of high-stamina commenters assigned to Win the War for Wikipedia by out-shouting and out-censoring Connolley and Co. They'd also go en masse to Amazon and give warmist books a thumbs-down and engage in comment-combats there and on other high-profile sites as well. But the dissenters in such venues have been an outnumbered, disorganized rabble.
10. Not only would there be more stylistic similarity, but the content would be less idiosyncratic as well. There'd be evidence of a “script” or list of talking points that skeptic commenters were following, instead of the typical home-brew assemblage of arguments.
11. There'd be an extensive online collection of opposition research, such as warmist predictions waiting to be shot down by contrary events. Such opposition research is so valuable a tactic (as is now being shown) that no political or PR consultant would have failed to insist on it.
E.g., a score of warmist predictions of less snowfall would have been at hand to counter Gore's claim that the models predicted more snowfall. Similarly, the IPCC's Assessment Reports would have been scoured for flaws and nits long ago. Instead, it wasn't until Glaciergate that we got on its case in any semi-organized fashion.
12. There'd be an online point-by-point rebuttal of all the “How to Talk to A Skeptic” talking points, not just scattered counterpoints to a few of them. And there'd be a Wikipedia discussing those points and more in fuller detail. Lucy Skywalker is trying to assemble these, but it's obviously an unfunded effort.
13. The Oregon Petition Project would have been handled professionally. I.e., there'd have been no short-sighted tactics such as use of NAS-lookalike typography, no claim that the signers constituted “a meaningful representation” (let alone that the consensus was on the skeptics' side), no claim that all the signers were scientists (when some were technologists and dentists, etc.), and no implication that the signers had all been vetted. A skilled propagandist, such as one hired by King Coal, would have avoided such a transparent over-reaching, which threw away the petition's effectiveness by handing the opposition a chance to counterpunch effectively.
14. There'd be a place for the reposting of the “highlights” of WUWT and other skeptic sites, and also such sites would have editors who would retroactively (after a month or so) work on a “sister site” consisting of “Highlights of WUWT,” in which outstanding paragraphs would be flagged and/or highlighted. This would make it easier for newcomers and journalists to effectively skim it and notice our better arguments and facts.
Such editorial work could be done by people who have good judgment and lots of knowledge of the issues, like Pamela Gray, Lucy Skywalker, etc.
15. There'd be a reposting of “negative highlights” from warmists' sites in which the unsavory qualities of their leading lights and hatchetmen were on display. Call it, maybe, “Quoted Without Comment” or “Get a Load of This.” It would make an impact on fence-sitters.
16. We'd be conducting polls of various groups of scientists designed to offset the effect of such polls by the other side.
17. There'd be mass distribution of my broken hockey stick button. (Here's a link to a comment where I describe the button: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/08/20/dueling-statements-in-the-american-chemical-socity-science-by-press-release/#comment-1062323 )
18. There'd be a spiffy ad campaign consisting of short spots (20 to 40 seconds) that would focus on making one quick jab at the warmists. There should be a standard format for these ads, such as a common tag-line, music, lead-in, graphics style, etc. It could be built on Anthony's TV-show items headed, “Did You Know?” The touch should be light, with the aim of making the spots entertaining, such as by including little bits of silly rhymes, etc. The ads should also be “different,” to get around viewers' defenses, and to make the message “sticky.” Care should be taken to avoid overstatement, and to make qualifications where necessary, to forestall counterpunches.
One easy target, because of its good “visuals” and absence of technical obscurity, would be to show non-performing wind turbines and weed-overgrown solar-panel farms. The failure of these ventures (relative to the promises that were made about them), and the fraud associated with them abroad, would be a benchmark against which other swarmist claims could be judged.
Here's an example (one that would not have had the negative consequences of the Unabomber billboard): A close up of of short bursts extracted from Chavez at Copenhagen ranting at length ala Castro (a superimposed stopwatch behind him would indicate the passage of time). At the end, the camera would pull back and show the standing ovation he received.
Then a text message would appear on-screen saying: “Chavez was allowed to exceed his ten-minute speaking time.
Where?
Three guesses. …
Why?
Three guesses. …
Is your congressman applauding too?”
(PS: I suspect, from the leftist venues Mann's spoken at, and from his victim-of-a-conspiracy mindset, that he's on their side.)
19. Certain fringe or off-topic comments would be “moderated” out, because they step on people's toes and don't play well in Peoria. E.g., New World Order theorizing, bolshy bashing, boot-the-UN and tar-and-feather-‘em remarks, and most attribution-of-motives comments. Populist “venting” of all sorts would be toned down; instead the stress would be on sweet reasonableness and out-reaching to the average citizen and opinion-leader. Any media pro would advise that course, especially one with a big funder behind him (who wouldn't want to be tarred by association with tin-foil-hat opinions (if news of a link ever came out)). Such a “mainstream” tone and mindset would be the fingerprint of any top-down campaign on a scientific topic.
20. There'd be much more stress on arguments that would move the masses and that don't take a degree to understand. I.e., arguments about the costliness, technical impracticality, and political unenforceability of mitigation strategies, and about the ineffectiveness of massive CO2 emission-reduction in the atmosphere even if all those obstacles were of no account.
If skeptics were truly Machiavellian, or guided by political “pros” behind the scenes, they'd be hitting these popular hot buttons. Those are where the warmists' case is shakiest — and it's always a good strategy to focus on the opponents' weakest points and pound on them endlessly. Instead, these topics make up only 10% or so of the skeptical thrust. Most dissenters devote most of their energy to talking about weather events, dissing believers, and arguing about technical and scientific matters.
21. We'd be pushing geoengineering as the preferred “adaptive” alternative to mitigation. It's something that the average man can understand as a general concept. E.g., if it rains, open your umbrella. Instead, contrarian bloggers we'd virtually never mention geoengineering except to sneer at it.
22. We'd make a point of proposing reasonable-sounding, politically popular “no regrets” mitigation measures, such as diesel cars (like Europe's), inducements for homes to convert from oil to gas for heating, incentives for insulation (including large awnings), incentives for battery assisted bicycles (like China's), increased use of hydro-power, and research into safe, low-waste nuclear power. Any PR “pro” would recommend this strategy of sweet reasonableness.
But many outspoken contrarian bloggers & commenters have a strong aversion to governmentally mandated incentives and penalties—a distinct minority position that it would be politically wise to conceal. In addition, contrarians aren't interested in playing up to an audience—they are focused almost entirely on mocking and scoring points against the enemy.
Big Oil? Baby Oil is more like it. Ologeneous overlords? My companions and I on Skull Island laughs until we vomit.

Another major overhaul is expected at Liverpool this summer with several players out of contract and a host of players expected to move on.
The summer always seems a time of great change under Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool — whether he likes it or not, his squad seems to shift dramatically from season to season, and ahead of 2015/16, this is unlikely to change.
In a recent interview with AnfieldHQ, The Telegraph's Merseyside correspondent Chris Bascombe suggested that as many as nine first-team squad players could leave Liverpool this summer.
However, with several contracts expiring and loan deals ending, it is likely that even more than that will depart Merseyside at the end of the season.
In fact, we make it that these 16 players could all leave Liverpool in the summer.
Brad Jones
Brought into the side at the end of 2014 in place of a flailing Simon Mignolet, Brad Jones proved just why he has been a backup goalkeeper for the majority of his career, conceding seven goals in four games.
With his contract set to expire at the end of this season, Jones will surely be turfed out of Anfield in favour of a more accomplished No. 2. Alternatively, he could remain as the club's third-choice.
Likelihood (of leaving): 4/5
Glen Johnson
Glen Johnson is another, like Jones, whose impending contract expiry comes at a timely opportunity for Rodgers — the right-back's ability has diminished severely in the last few seasons.
With the switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation this season, Johnson's options have become even more limited, as he is incapable of consistently delivering in a wing-back role or defensively strong enough to fill a centre-back slot.
Rodgers has, bizarrely, said he wants to keep him around but the latest reports suggest he's set to leave the club with his reported £120,000 a week wages a major issue.
Likelihood: 4.5/5
Jose Enrique
Another wayward full-back figure, Jose Enrique has made just four league appearances for the Reds so far this season, largely due to his continued struggles to achieve match fitness.
On the field, Enrique is far from the quality required at Liverpool and, while he is an accomplished attacking full-back when on form, is hugely inconsistent.
Rodgers just needs to find a willing buyer.
Likelihood: 4/5
Kolo Toure
Unlike Jones and Johnson, Kolo Toure's soon-to-be free agent status is a rather disappointing situation, given the comfortable performances the centre-back has provided when called upon this season, his invaluable experience and contentment in a backup role.
Talks have reportedly taken place over extending his stay, but Toure says: “It is a big decision and that is why I need to think very hard and take a decision and stick with it.”
Likelihood: 4/5
Jon Flanagan
Similar to Toure, Jon Flanagan's muted contract negotiations should alarm Liverpool fans, after the local lad's encouraging performances in a variety of roles last season — why is an arguably simple extension taking so long to arrange?
Having missed the whole of the season so far through injury, the returning Flanagan faces a fight to convince Rodgers of his long-term future, although Bascombe suggests he will stay.
Likelihood: 2/5
Javier Manquillo
The return of Flanagan could prompt another shift in the defensive pecking order in Rodgers' squad, with on-loan right-back Javier Manquillo suffering from his contemporary's introduction.
Despite impressing in his 10 league appearances so far this season, Manquillo has dropped out of favour with the introduction of the 3-4-2-1 formation, his primarily defensive qualities not suiting a wing-back role.
Liverpool can make the deal permanent for around £5 million in the summer, if Manquillo is deemed to have settled, but similarly parent club Atletico Madrid can cut short his spell for a fee.
Likelihood: 2.5/5
Sebastian Coates
Despite some encouraging performances for the Reds in pre-season, Uruguayan centre-back Sebastian Coates was sent on loan to Premier League outfit Sunderland.
The 24-year-old has made just four league appearances for the Black Cats, and he is unlikely to fare any better on his return to Merseyside.
Likelihood: 4.5/5
Andre Wisdom
Andre Wisdom was initially an important figure for loan side West Bromwich Albion this season, but has found himself out of favour under new boss Tony Pulis in recent weeks.
Wisdom could return in a centre-back or wing-back role in the summer, but is more likely to find a regular role elsewhere.
Likelihood: 3.5/5
Steven Gerrard
This one is set in stone: Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool this summer to join MLS franchise LA Galaxy.
Whether the midfielder returns in a short-term winter loan deal in 2016 remains to be seen.
Likelihood: 5/5
Lucas Leiva
Bascombe made some interesting comments on the future of midfielder Lucas Leiva: “He's had interest in him for a while and I think he had his heart set on moving on.”
While Lucas has returned an important figure in the second half of this season, perennial links to the likes of Inter Milan and Napoli in Serie A could well come to fruition this summer.
Likelihood: 3.5/5
Joao Carlos Teixeira
Playing well on loan with Brighton & Hove Albion, but now 22 years old, Joao Carlos Teixeira may have missed the boat in terms of a long-term future at Liverpool.
Speaking last month, Teixeira didn't seem too optimistic about his chances of a return to Merseyside: “I really want [to return] and I'm going to work for it but you never know what's going to happen in the future. Of course I would see Brighton as an option.”
Likelihood: 4/5
Luis Alberto
Like Teixeira, 22-year-old attacking midfielder Luis Alberto may struggle for chances in what is already a heavily loaded front line next season at Liverpool.
A bit-part player at loan club Malaga this season, Alberto's quality is evident, but his suitability to Rodgers' high-intensity system is another matter entirely.
Likelihood: 4.5/5
Rickie Lambert
Having rejected a deadline-day move to Aston Villa in January, Rickie Lambert signalled his intentions to stake a claim for a regular role under Rodgers at Liverpool, despite the manager being willing to sanction his move away “if I wanted to play football,” as Lambert revealed.
That deal came too late in the day for Lambert to make such a big career decision, but a summer move is likely.
Likelihood: 4/5
Iago Aspas
A round disappointment in his first season at Liverpool, Iago Aspas was loaned out at the first opportunity last summer, joining La Liga side Sevilla.
Sevilla can make the transfer permanent for £5 million this summer, and Rodgers won't stand in their way.
Likelihood: 4.5/5
Fabio Borini
Fabio Borini made a very “important decision,” when he turned down summer moves to Queens Park Rangers and Sunderland in 2014, admirably preferring to fight for his place at Liverpool.
Unsurprisingly, however, Borini has found his chances limited, and the emergence of Raheem Sterling as Rodgers' second-choice centre-forward can only help to draw the line through his Merseyside career.
Likelihood: 4/5
Mario Balotelli
A £16 million gamble last summer, Mario Balotelli was arguably doomed from the start at Liverpool—Rodgers has never seemed happy with the striker.
Despite some influential displays for the Reds last month, Balotelli still finds his role on the periphery, and as Bascombe confirms, will leave if Liverpool can recuperate anywhere near the money they paid for him.
Likely departures:
Brad Jones – Released
Glen Johnson – Released
Jose Enrique – £3 million
Kolo Toure – Released
Sebastian Coates – £2 million
Andre Wisdom – £5 million
Steven Gerrard – Free Transfer to LA Galaxy
Lucas Leiva – £10 million
Joao Carlos Teixeira – £1 million
Luis Alberto – £5 million
Rickie Lambert – £4 million
Iago Aspas – £5 million
Fabio Borini – £8 million
Mario Balotelli – £12 million
Projected income from sales – £55m

Who should Liverpool be looking to sell and who should they be looking to hold onto this summer? Let us know in the comments below.
© Chris Graythen/Getty Images Buffalo Bills offensive line punched a juvenile this weekend - he claims he was threatened and that it was too dark to tell the kids age.
By Steve DelVecchio
Buffalo Bills offensive line coach Aaron Kromer was arrested over the weekend after he allegedly punched a juvenile boy in the face and threatened to kill his family. From the sound of it, Kromer is planning to argue that he acted in self-defense.
Alex Marvez of FOX Sports cites a “source” who claims Kromer was threatened by some “belligerent” kids and he could not identify their age because it was dark out. The boys had supposedly taken beach chairs that belonged to Kromer without permission.
“It was dark out. He couldn't see the people,” Marvez was told. “The kids were belligerent and threatened him. Bottom line, they stole his property and he couldn't identify them because it was dark out and they threatened him.”
How dark does it have to be for a person to tell the difference between a serious situation and some kids messing around? I highly doubt that excuse is going to hold up in court if Kromer is charged with misdemeanor battery or assaulting a minor.
As we mentioned before, some of you may be familiar with Kromer after he created a buzz by anonymously bashing Jay Cutler last season. Despite that, Rex Ryan still decided to hire the 48-year-old veteran. The working relationship may not last long.
In 2018, we are witnessing the creation of hundreds of new blockchain projects. As with any growing industry, the majority of new projects that crop up around it are barely noticeable, while the community focuses on a promising few.
Since January 2009, when Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, no year has passed without the community witnessing new and interesting blockchain projects. It is becoming difficult to keep track of all the new ones being designed, developed, and brought to market.
The following five blockchain projects are worth watching in 2018.
1. EOS
EOS blockchain is designed to do everything that the Ethereum blockchain does. But it tries to tackle challenges that Ethereum faces, such as high fees, a complex user interface and poor scalability.
To make its use more convenient, EOS removes the need for gas when running an application. Instead, according to the amount of computing power they need, developers put an amount of the native coin in a stake account. Thus they become co-owners of the platform.
Daniel Larimer, the founder and chief technology officer of Block.one, is also the founder of the decentralised asset exchange platform BitShares and the decentralised blogging platform Steemit.
In an interview on the Epicenter podcast, Larimer disclosed that he plans to stay with EOS and has no plans to leave for another project, as he has done with both BitShares and Steemit. The reason, he says, is because the EOS design will allow him to build any other projects he may have in mind.
2. Aeternity
Ethereum introduced smart contract applications to the world. But its design has a lot of weaknesses that startups aim up to fix. In addition to EOS's attempt to solve some of these weaknesses, we then have Aeternity.
Two main issues that the Aeternity blockchain focusses on are scalability and the enrichment of smart contracts with necessary real-world data.
The team behind Aeternity designed it with built-in state channel functionality, the same feature Bitcoin is adopting through the Lightning Network. The state channel capacity ensures that the blockchain can handle an infinite number of transactions by allowing users to create peer-to-peer channels that confirm only the first and last transactions.
The most revolutionary feature of Aeternity, however, is its ability to support the feeding of smart contracts with real-world data in real time. This is done through the use of oracles that are part of the peer-to-peer network on which the blockchain runs.
On the platform, smart contracts can be executed based on factors like prevailing weather conditions or stock market prices.
Aeternity was launched in late 2017 and it is registered as a business in Liechtenstein. The project raised about US$30 million in funding through an ICO that ran between April and June 2017 to support its development.
3. IOTA
IOTA offers a significantly different implementation of blockchain or distributed ledger. It uses Tangle technology, which powers micro transactions with no requirement for users to pay fees. In place of fees, users help confirm one another's transactions.
Due to support of free micropayment transactions, IOTA's founders and developers have positioned the project as best suited for the internet of things (IOT).
In December 2015, IOTA raised close to US$600,000 from its token sale. The project has grown in value over time and today sits in the top ten in terms of market capitalisation, at over US$5 billion. The team has formed alliances with various entities in its goal toward building a new structure for the global economy. By removing the need for fees, it allows both natural and artificial counterparties to send and receive transactions.
4. Golem
Decentralised platform Golem allows people in the network to sublet computer power for free to others who need it to perform various kinds of computational tasks.
Golem has implemented a concept similar to decentralised storage platforms Filecoin, Sia and Storj. Instead of storage, the Israeli-based startup facilitates the renting and letting of computer power in a peer-to-peer fashion.
In April, Golem launched on the Ethereum mainnet, a year and a half after it raised over 820,000 ETH (about US$500 million at 2018 exchange rates) from the sale of the platform's native token.
5. DTube
A competitor with YouTube in the video content market, DTube is an application built on top of the Steemit peer-to-peer network. On Steemit's blogging website, content creators are paid according to the number of reactions they get from content consumers in terms of likes and comments. DTube users who upload videos will be paid using a similar model: according to the number of views, likes and comments they accumulate.
Payments are made in Steem, the native coin of the Steemit network. The emission designed into the platform's protocol is the source of the coins. Users can convert earnings into other cryptocurrencies, as well as into fiat money.
This week the world looked on in horror as a huge London tower block burned with residents still inside. Just a day later, a headline in UK tabloid The Sun declared "Kodi Boxes" a fire hazard and a risk to public safety. Was that awful timing? Cautionary advice? Or flat-out anti-piracy opportunism?
Anyone who saw the pictures this week couldn't have failed to be moved by the plight of Londoners caught up in the Grenfell Tower inferno. The apocalyptic images are likely to stay with people for years to come and the scars for those involved may never heal.
As the building continued to smolder and the death toll increased, UK tabloids provided wall-to-wall coverage of the disaster. On Thursday, however, The Sun took a short break to put out yet another sensationalized story about Kodi. Given the week's events, it was bound to raise eyebrows.
“HOT GOODS: Kodi boxes are a fire hazard because thousands of IPTV devices nabbed by customs ‘failed UK electrical standards',” the headline reads.
Another sensational ‘Kodi' headline
“It's estimated that thousands of Brits have bought so-called Kodi boxes which can be connected to telly sets to stream pay-per-view sport and films for free,” the piece continued.
“But they could be a fire hazard, according to the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), which has been nabbing huge deliveries of the devices as they arrive in the UK.”
As the image below shows, “Kodi box” fire hazard claims appeared next to images from other news articles about the huge London fire. While all separate stories, the pairing is not a great look.
A ‘Kodi Box', as depicted in The Sun
FACT chief executive Kieron Sharp told The Sun that his group had uncovered two parcels of 2,000 ‘Kodi' boxes and found that they “failed electrical safety standards”, making them potentially dangerous. While that may well be the case, the big question is all about timing.
It's FACT's job to reduce copyright infringement on behalf of clients such as The Premier League so it's no surprise that they're making a sustained effort to deter the public from buying these devices. That being said, it can't have escaped FACT or The Sun that fire and death are extremely sensitive topics this week.
That leaves us with a few options including unfortunate opportunism or perhaps terrible timing, but let's give the benefit of the doubt for a moment.
There's a good argument that FACT and The Sun brought a valid issue to the public's attention at a time when fire safety is on everyone's lips. So, to give credit where it's due, providing people with a heads-up about potentially dangerous devices is something that most people would welcome.
However, it's difficult to offer congratulations on the PSA when the story as it appears in The Sun does nothing – absolutely nothing – to help people stay safe.
If some boxes are a risk (and that's certainly likely given the level of Far East imports coming into the UK) which ones are dangerous? Where were they manufactured? Who sold them? What are the serial numbers? Which devices do people need to get out of their houses?
Sadly, none of these questions were answered or even addressed in the article, making it little more than scaremongering. Only making matters worse, the piece notes that it isn't even clear how many of the seized devices are indeed a fire risk and that more tests need to be done. Is this how we should tackle such an important issue during an extremely sensitive week?
Timing and lack of useful information aside, one then has to question the terminology employed in the article.
As a piece of computer software, Kodi cannot catch fire. So, what we're actually talking about here is small computers coming into the country without passing safety checks. The presence of Kodi on the devices – if indeed Kodi was even installed pre-import – is absolutely irrelevant.
Anti-piracy groups warning people of the dangers associated with their piracy habits is nothing new. For years, Internet users have been told that their computers will become malware infested if they share files or stream infringing content. While in some cases that may be true, there's rarely any effort by those delivering the warnings to inform people on how to stay safe.
A classic example can be found in the numerous reports put out by the Digital Citizens Alliance in the United States. The DCA has produced several and no doubt expensive reports which claim to highlight the risks Internet users are exposed to on ‘pirate' sites.
The DCA claims to do this in the interests of consumers but the group offers no practical advice on staying safe nor does it provide consumers with risk reduction strategies. Like many high-level ‘drug prevention' documents shuffled around government, it could be argued that on a ‘street' level their reports are next to useless.
Demonizing piracy is a well-worn and well-understood strategy but if warnings are to be interpreted as representing genuine concern for the welfare of people, they have to be a lot more substantial than mere scaremongering.

Update: After the publication of this article The Sun began editing its article so that it reads somewhat differently. Here's a list of the key edits.
Key edit 1: “Thousands” of boxes has now become “a number” of boxes.
Original piece: “Thousands of ‘Internet Protocol Television' (IPTV) boxes failed to meet the UK's electrical safety standards when intercepted at customs, the UK's top copyright organisation has warned.”
Edited piece: “A number of “Internet Protocol Television” (IPTV) boxes failed to meet the UK's electrical safety, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) has warned.”

Key edit 2: “All failed electrical safety standards” has been changed to “several devices” failed safety standards.
Original piece: “FACT's chief executive Kieron Sharp told The Sun Online that the boxes “all failed electrical safety standards”, making them potentially dangerous.”
Edited piece: “FACT's chief executive Kieron Sharp told The Sun Online that when tested several devices “failed electrical safety standards”, making them potentially dangerous.”

Key edit 3: Reference to 2,000 boxes ALL failing safety standards has been completely removed.
Original piece: “[Sharp] said: ‘Our assignment uncovered two different parcels of 2,000 boxes and found that they all failed these standards'. We asked if this meant they were a fire hazard and he replied: ‘Yes.'”
Edited piece: All references to the 2,000 boxes that reportedly all failed standards has been completely removed.

Thirteen-month-old Imad Aleeyan, who has six teeth, was found chewing on the head of the 12 inch snake by his mother, who alerted the neighbourhood with her screams.
"I was making his milk and I looked over and saw he had a snake in his mouth," said his mother, Ghadir Aleeyan who lives in the Arab Israeli town of Shefa'Amr, 9 miles east of the port city of Haifa.
"I started to scream. I couldn't believe my eyes," she told AFP. "I nearly died of fright."
Her screams brought the rest of the family – and the neighbourhood – running.
"We rushed in and found the baby with a snake in his mouth, chewing it. It was really scary, just horrible," the boy's aunt, Yasmin Shahin, said.
A neighbour who had rushed to see what was going on yanked the half-dead reptile out of the boys mouth and killed it, she said.
"When he pulled it out, Imad started crying," she said, describing the snake's head as "very badly chewed" when it emerged from the boys mouth.
They immediately checked the child for any bite marks but found none, with doctors at Rambam hospital in Haifa confirming he was unharmed.
"Doctors at the hospital told us the snake was really poisonous but that we were very lucky because they release less venom in the winter," she said.
Dr Boaz Shacham, an expert on amphibians and reptiles, told AFP that from looking at images of the smashed-up serpent online, it appeared to be a coin-marked snake (hemorrhois nummifer), a non-venomous species which resembles a viper.
Such snakes grow up to three feet in length, he said suggesting it was a "very young" specimen.
"It probably didn't bite the child because of the cold," said Dr Shacham who is the head of the herpetology collection at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
"They are not really active in winter."

His name has gone down in literary history as the meanie who said ‘bah humbug' to Christmas, but the inspiration for Ebenezer Scrooge was actually a successful, generous and jovial Edinburgh merchant.
Actor Richard Wilson depicts Dickens' popular Christmas character, Ebenezer Scrooge
Charles Dickens created Scrooge after seeing the gravestone of Ebenezer Scroggie while filling in time on a lecture visit to Scotland in 1842.
The novelist misread the surname as Scrooge and thought ‘mealman' – a reference to Scroggie's career as a corn trader – was ‘Meanman'.
Inspired by the name and shocked by the apparently hard-hearted inscription, Dickens wrote about it in his notebook.
The following year he published A Christmas Carol and a legend was born.
But now campaigners want to raise awareness of Scroggie's grave which lies unmarked a few metres away from Edinburgh's Royal Mile, and publicise the fact he was actually known for his generosity, jovial nature and wild parties.

The tombstone was removed when Canongate Kirkyard was redeveloped in the 1930s but now a memorial may be put up telling Scroggie's story.
‘Characters like this should not be hidden away or forgotten about,' said Marion Williams, of the Cockburn Association, which protects historic Edinburgh.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A California judge on June 22 struck down a proposed ballot measure that would have made same-sex sexual activity punishable by death.
Superior Court Judge Raymond M. Cadei in a one-page ruling said the so-called Sodomite Suppression Act that Matthew McLaughlin, an Orange County attorney proposed in February, is “patently unconstitutional on its face.” Cadei also ruled that Attorney General Kamala Harris does not have to circulate petitions in order to place it on the ballot.
“Any preparation and official issuance of a circulating title and summary for the fact by the attorney general would be inappropriate, waste public resources, generate unnecessary divisions among the public and tend to mislead the electorate,” wrote Cadei. “The attorney general is relieved of any obligation to issue a title and summary for the act.”
Harris in March requested a court order that would allow her to refuse to act on the proposed ballot measure.
“This proposal not only threatens the public safety, it is patently unconstitutional, utterly reprehensible and has no place in civil society,” Harris said.
A pack of at least 50 wolves has been repelled safely by members of fire department in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, after reports of a growing menace posed by the wild animals.
The wolves had gathered in a fruit garden close to the newly-built town of Kooye Farzaneh in suburbs of the city of Takab, making it their night lair, where they created public panic particularly through nightly growling and howling, said the head of fire department of Takab, Rasoul Shadabi, on Saturday.
Firefighters were dispatched to the area, where they set up booby traps, made fire, and hurled fireworks to scare the wild animals away.
The firefighters, with the assistance of a number of local residents, were engaged in the operation from 5 pm on Thursday to 2 am on Friday and finally managed to chase away the pack and destroy its den. The pack went back to the nearby mountains, where they came from. According to Shadabi, not a single wolf was hurt in the operation.
A view of Takab in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province
Iranian wolves, a subspecies of gray wolf, tend to be slightly smaller than their northern European and American counterparts, standing approximately 45 centimeters (18 inches) to 76 centimeters (30 inches) tall at the shoulder and weighing roughly between 25 kilograms (55 pounds) and 30 kilograms (70 pounds).
Their light-gray fur is short with either little or no undercoat, due to drier and harsher climate they live in.
Iron Ring, stainless steel version, issued circa 2013
Iron Ring, iron version, circa 2005
Iron Ring, stainless steel version, circa 2004
The Iron Ring is a ring worn by many Canadian-trained engineers, as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession. From a concept originated in 1922,[1] the ring is presented to graduates in a closed ceremony known as The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer,[2][3] developed with the assistance of English poet Rudyard Kipling.[2]
The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer's obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. It is not a symbol of qualification as an engineer – this is determined by the provincial and territorial licensing bodies.[4]
Material and design [ edit ]
The Iron Ring is made from either iron or stainless steel.[5] The first ceremony awarding the ring was held in 1925, under the supervision of Herbert E. T. Haultain, professor of mining engineering at the University of Toronto.[3]
The rings are given in ceremonies held at individual universities, each assigned one of 26 camps of the Corporation of the Seven Wardens. Because iron deteriorates turning the finger black and making the ring fit more loosely, all camps except Toronto have stopped conferring rings made of iron and have switched to stainless steel rings. At the Toronto camp, the individual ceremonies held at the University of Toronto, University of Ottawa, Ryerson University, York University and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, continue to provide recipients with a choice of rings made of iron or stainless steel.
Many incorrectly believe that the rings are made from the steel of a beam from the first Quebec Bridge, which collapsed during construction in 1907. Seventy-five construction workers died in the collapse which was attributed to poor planning and design by the overseeing engineers.[6] Rudyard Kipling, who wrote the ritual obligation,[2] indicated that the Ring as an allegory in itself be rough, not smoothed, and hammered, and as a ring have no beginning nor end. There is no evidence that there is any particular history in the source of "Cold Iron" (from the Calling of the Engineer ceremony) for the Ring, nor any intention that there should have been. Remnants of the Quebec Bridge legend still exist in Canada.[3][5]
The Iron Ring is worn on the little finger ("pinky") of the working (dominant) hand.[5] There, the facets act as a sharp reminder of one's obligation while the engineer works, because it could drag on the writing surface while the engineer is drawing or writing. This is particularly true of recently obligated engineers, whose rings bear sharp, unworn, facets. Protocol dictates that the rings should be returned by retired engineers or by the families of deceased engineers. Some camps offer previously obligated or "experienced" rings, but they are now rare due to medical and practical complications.
The Ring itself is small and understated, designed as a constant reminder, rather than a piece of jewelry. The Rings were originally hammered manually with a rough outer surface. The modern machined ring design is unique, a reminder of the manual process. Twelve half-circle facets are carved into the top and bottom of the outer surface, with the two sets of facets offset rotationally by fifteen degrees.
Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer [ edit ]
The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer is the ceremony where Iron Rings are given to graduating engineers who choose to obligate themselves to the highest professionalism and humility of their profession. It is a symbol that reflects the moral, ethical and professional commitment made by the engineer who wears the ring. The ceremonies are private affairs with no publicity. Invitations to attend are extended to local engineering alumni and professional engineers by those who are scheduled to participate. For some schools, the invitation to witness the ceremony is open to anyone in the engineering profession, and non-obligated engineers may not participate in the ritual. Some graduating engineers choose to receive a ring passed on from a relative or mentor, giving the ceremony a personal touch.
Adoption in the United States [ edit ]
An example of a plain stainless steel band issued by the Order of the Engineer in the United States
Based upon the success of the Iron Ring in Canada, a similar program was created in the United States, where the Order of the Engineer[7] was founded in 1970. The organization conducts similar ring ceremonies at a number of U.S. colleges, in which the recipient signs an "Obligation of the Engineer"[8] and receives a stainless steel Engineer's Ring (which, unlike the Canadian Iron Ring, can be smooth and not faceted). The first such ceremony occurred on June 4, 1970, at the Cleveland State University under the supervision of Lloyd Chancy.[9]

The League of Legends Championship Series slot formerly owned by Gravity Gaming has been purchased by former Boston Celtics and LA Lakers legend Rick Fox.
The three time NBA champion becomes the most decorated athlete to move into eSports ownership. The team will no longer be known as Gravity Gaming and instead will be rebranded as “Echo Fox” for the upcoming season and beyond.
Fox, who now plies his trade as an actor, is no stranger to gaming, having previously partnered with the official gaming world record authority Twin Galaxies. He even donated his three NBA Championship Rings to the campaign #Right2Game which supports the elevation of video game players throughout the world. Fox has been following the competitive gaming scene for some time and now feels it is right to take the plunge into ownership.
In a formal press release, Fox said: “As a professional athlete, businessman and proud member of the gaming community, I see the way that the eSports world is growing and I know we are on the verge of something massive. The opportunity to parlay my experience in sports, entertainment and gaming into a leadership role with Echo Fox is exciting and humbling. This decision is equal parts business and personal for me.”
“The desire, focus, dedication and work ethic that I have seen from athletes in the eSports space reminds me of the competition I felt as I pursued a career in basketball,” Fox added. “My passion was supported and embraced by society and, as owner of Echo Fox, I plan to be an advocate for our athletes in the same way.”
This purchase represents the latest in a string of high profile acquisitions in eSports, particularly in the LCS. Team Dignitas recently announced selling their spot for in excess of $1 million to Follow Esports, now rebranded as Splyce. The Immortals Franchise is owned by a group of investors that includes Peter Levin, the president of Lionsgate Interactive Venture and Games, Steve Kaplan, a co-owner of the basketball franchise Memphis Grizzlies, and the business arm of the band Linkin Park. An investment group including co-owners from the Sacramento Kings franchise also recently purchased an LCS team, now called NRG Esports.
This is an update of etherial's Great Wall of Weyland deck, updated for the new Constellation Ice.
The original deck is discussed here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1053047/deck-great-wall-weyland
I also blogged about it here: http://thesatelliteuplink.blogspot.com/2013/10/decklists-not-just-same-old-thing.html
The basic plan is "Advance Ice, Commercialise, Trick of Light, Profit". The main changes are in the Ice base, with the old deck forced to play Shadow and Hadrian's Wall in order to have enough advanceable Ice. I can upgrade those to Fire Wall and a mix of the big Wormhole/Orion 'constellation' Ice. Most of the changes to the rest of the deck flow from this Ice restructure.
1) No Shadow = no tags = no Scorched Earth. Power Shutdown replaces
2) Constellation Ice = Advances spread across more Ice not piled on one = Commercialisation gets worse, Shipment From Kaguya becomes better
The rest is minor reshuffles, and I've been surprised so far by how effective this is proving. The constellation Ice really helps push the Weyland BWBI ability up a notch - now each advance you put down is worth 3 credits, not 1. The economy benefit of the constellation Ice is so much that where Trick of Light was previously only ever saved for fast advance Agendas it's sometimes a reasonable play to use it to just cut 6 off the cost of Orion. You can install Orion, Trick, Advance with your recurring credit, and then rez it for a total cost of 7 (6 + ToL).
Quetzal and D4v1d both hurt this deck somewhat, probably Quetzal most of all. If you think she's big in your meta then I'd look to replace Fire Wall with the old school Hadrian's Wall, and maybe use the Power Shutdown slots to beef up your economy to pay for them. Although D4v1d is efficient against this deck the sheer number of big Ice should mean their sling runs out rocks pretty quickly.
The deck is quite linear, playing almost a glacier style due to the big Ice, but without building Ice towers so deep or really needing that much money - this is a Weyland deck that rarely has tons of cash and can function from a single digits bank balance quite happily.
Thomas Haas is rarely spectacular but he's your dangling bait to tempt runners into wading through your big glacier for no reward - he's there to drain the runner and also to catch Blackmails/Inside Jobs etc
This is still a development deck, but what I thought was a lousy theme deck I built just to use some Order & Chaos cards has so far not dropped a game. Not against premium opposition, but it's been very comfortable so far...
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Monday that Asian nations were pulling the global economy out of its downturn but warned that both Asia and the United States needed to do more to reduce global trade imbalances.
Speaking at a conference on Asia hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Mr. Bernanke said Asian countries had bounced back from the global recession faster than the rest of the world and had reported “impressive” growth.
“Asia appears to be leading the global economic recovery,” the Fed chairman said, noting that the region as a whole expanded at an annual rate of 9 percent during the second quarter and that some countries, including China, grew at rates of more than 10 percent.
But Mr. Bernanke also warned that huge trade imbalances between the United States and the rest of the world had played a central role in the global economic crisis and that they could do so again.

“We were smug,” Mr. Bernanke said of the United States in a question-and-answer session, referring to the attitude of American policymakers toward the large inflows of cheap money from countries like China that were running huge trade surpluses. The flood of foreign money might not have been a major problem, he said, but the American financial regulatory system was “inadequate” in preventing a surge of reckless lending that aggravated the bubble in housing prices.
We're all aware of the growing accumulation of space debris orbiting our planet, but some of these debris objects are coming back to haunt Earth in a rather unusual way. The European Space Agency (ESA) recently discovered that what was previously classified as near Earth object (NEO) 2013 QW1 is actually manmade.
“It was a bit of a challenge, because the object was moving fast with respect to a typical suspected NEO,” said Dr Davide Perna of the Observatoire de Paris, Meudon. “But despite the difficulties, observations were made with an instrument called DOLORES, for ‘Device Optimized for the LOw RESolution', which allowed us to obtain the object's spectrum.”
The result was a spectrum that does not resemble any asteroid. Instead, it bore strong similarities with the spectra of previously observed space junk such as discarded rocket stages, abandoned boosters or defunct satellites.
This is not the first time an artificial object took on a peculiar orbit. The third stage of Apollo 12 took an interesting journey when it failed to crash into the lunar surface as intended. In 2002 it was identified as asteroid J002E3. Later study discovered that the object's spectral signature matched the white paint used on Apollo rockets. J002E3's orbit was quite unusual, spending some time in the Sun-Earth first Lagrange point before swooping close enough to Earth to endanger operational satellites. J002E3 is off roaming the solar system now, but may return to Earth orbit in the 2040's.
Nor is J002E3 the only such object. 6Q0B44E was first thought to be a meteor when it was spotted in 2006; it's now considered artificial but its originating spacecraft is not known. In the opposite situation, 2006 RH 120, discovered shortly after 6Q0B44E, was first thought to be manmade because it exhibited reflectance similar to the aforementioned Apollo booster paint. It turned out to be a small asteroid now out orbiting the Sun, although some think it stills owes its existence to human activity as ejected lunar rock from one of the Apollo impacts.
Clearly, it can be challenging to identify just what it whizzing around up there. Fortunately, we don't frequently have the problem that cropped up in 2007 when a Catalina Sky Survey astronomer mistakenly labelled the Rosetta spacecraft as asteroid 2007 VN 84 making a scarily-close approach at 5,700 km. Rosetta survived its Earth flyby without interference and is now en route to its 2014 rendezvous with comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.
At the end of the day, these small episodes of confusion are just one more reason to keep our eyes (or telescopes) trained on the skies. With all the asteroids, boosters, and satellites rocketing around up there, you never know what might happen.

A diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and Russia is now threatened after President Vladimir Putin ordered 755 U.S. diplomats to leave Russia. A total of 755 American diplomats will have to leave Russia as a result of Washington's own policies, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, said on ABC's This Week that his country's retaliation over U.S. actions against Russia was “overdue.”
“I think this retaliation is long, long overdue.”
On Sunday, Putin sat with Russian television host, Vladimir Solovyov, in an exclusive interview with Rossiya 1 TV.
“The American side has made a move which, it is important to note, hasn't been provoked by anything, to worsen Russian-US relations. [It includes] unlawful restrictions, attempts to influence other states of the world, including our allies, who are interested in developing and keeping relations with Russia.”
The Russian leader said they remained hopeful that something would change for the better.
“We've been waiting for quite a long time that maybe something would change for the better, we had hopes that the situation would change. But it looks like, it's not going to change in the near future… I decided that it is time for us to show that we will not leave anything unanswered.”
The Russian foreign ministry announced that Moscow told Washington to reduce the number of its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people. The events follow U.S. Congress' approval of new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
By September of 2017, the number of the United States diplomatic service staff in Russia was officially ordered to be reduced in order to equal the number of Russian diplomats in the United States.
null
The American diplomatic mission carries over 1,200 personnel and “greatly exceeds” the number of Russia's embassy staff in the United States.
“From the perspective of a working diplomatic mission, [the measure] is fairly sensitive.”
Once the bill becomes law, Trump will be unable to ease sanctions against Russia, according to the Washington Examiner, unless he gets congressional approval to do so.
null
The legislation cleared through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, coming in with a 98-2 vote in the Senate and 419-3 in the House.
The legislation is said to be a larger response to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
“We have a very rich toolbox at our disposal. It would be ridiculous on my part to start speculating on what may or may not happen.”
In December, thirty-five Russian diplomats were expelled from the United States under sanctions President Barack Obama imposed over Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, according to CNN. The sanctions also included the closure of two Russian compounds, in Maryland and New York, used for intelligence purposes.

Moscow has asked Washington to provide clarifications on reports that the U.S. military has hacked into Russia's critical infrastructure and its intention to leverage this access to retaliate in case of serious disruptions to the upcoming elections.
NBC News reported on Friday that it learned from a senior U.S. intelligence official and top-secret documents that United States military hackers have broken into Russia's telecommunications networks, electric grid and Kremlin's command systems. This will allegedly allow the U.S. to attack these critical systems if necessary.
In response to the report, Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked U.S. officials to provide clarifications.
“The lack of an official response from the American Administration would indicate the existence of state-sponsored cyber-terrorism in the United States, and in the case of enforcement threats, broadcast through American media, Moscow will have a full right to bring appropriate charges against Washington,” reads a translation of the statement published by Moscow over the weekend.
Following a series of cyberattacks attributed to Russia, including against the systems of the U.S. Democratic Party and voter registration databases, the United States officially accused Russia of being behind the attacks with the intent of interfering with the presidential election. Moreover, the U.S. has vowed to respond at a “time and place of our choosing.”
Russia has denied the accusations, calling them flattering, but false. However, the Kremlin slammed Washington for making threats.
"The threats directed against Moscow and our state's leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the US vice president," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Guccifer 2.0, the hacker who has taken credit for the Democratic Party cyberattacks, said he will be observing the elections in the United States and urged other hackers to “monitor the elections from inside the system.” Some security experts believe Guccifer 2.0 is a persona used by Russia to throw investigators off track.

The U.S. Navy on Saturday with the help of President Donald Trump commissioned its most powerful warship yet: the USS Gerald Ford.
The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is rigged with state-of-the-art technology with a capacity for more aircraft and weaponry than ever before.
It features an electromagnetic launch system and advanced arresting gear for faster and more efficient take-offs and landings. The vessel is outfitted with touchscreen navigation display in place of a traditional throttle and is equipped with a reactor plant that can power the ship for up to 20 years without refueling.
The USS Ford is also massive, with its length of 1,106-feet comparing to the size of about three football fields. The extra room allows for an expanded flight deck that's easier for jets and drones to maneuver around. Additionally, it features a better-positioned “island” structure, giving the captain of the ship improved visibility.
More than double the electrical capacity and automated equipment means the ship can sail more efficiently with at least 600 fewer crew members. Once officially deployed in 2020, it will house 2,600 sailors, which the Navy says will save more than $4 billion over the ship's 50-year lifespan, according to the Associated Press.
Trump, the commander in chief of the U.S. military, was on hand at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia to preside over the commissioning ceremony.

The President initially criticized the USS Gerald Ford, one of three of the futuristic ships the Navy has ordered, telling Time in May that the digital aircraft carrier “costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it's no good.”
The final price tag for the ship came out to about $13 billion and was delayed over the course of its construction.
Green Bay's Luther Robinson tips a pass that Julius Peppers then intercepted and returned for a touchdown. Credit: Rick Wood
By of the
Green Bay — When Ted Thompson entered the Bermuda Triangle that is football in March for the Green Bay Packers, this is the play he had in mind. A play this defense has lacked.
Luther Robinson deflects Christian Ponder's pass. Julius Peppers is there for the interception.
And then Peppers flashed back to his days as a high school running back, off to the races for a 49-yard touchdown return.
"Pep's a sensational athlete," outside linebacker Clay Matthews said. "He surprises us every day he's out here with every facet of his game."
And yet, Peppers wasn't alone. He got to the quarterback. Matthews got to the quarterback. Even Nick Perry — remember him? — got to the quarterback. The Packers' maligned defense caved the pocket all game long. The result was a mash-up of game-changing plays and a 42-10 win.
The lesson? Pressure can cure all.
Defensive coordinator Dom Capers' unit finished with six sacks and 16 quarterback hits. Part of the equation was, of course, the putrid quarterback play of Ponder. This nationally televised game could have used a disclaimer once Teddy Bridgewater was declared inactive. But Thursday night also unveiled everything the Packers want out of their defense, be it 4-3, 3-4, nickel, whatever.
Get to the quarterback and good things happen.
On Ponder, it snowballed. Matthews can't recall the last time it went quite like this.
"It's been a while," Matthews said. "But any time you can force a team to be one-dimensional, then you can turn your guys loose. We weren't able to do that last week. And looking further back, we weren't able to do that in weeks prior. Running backs were able to rush on us.
"Once we're able to shut that down, we've got some special athletes as far as rushing the passer. It's just a matter of time before we get home. I felt like we did that tonight."
And then some.
The Packers raced ahead, 14-0, and teed off. Five different players were responsible for the six sacks. Everyone joined the party.
There was Perry, that 2012 first-rounder, getting two sacks. There was Letroy Guion, cast off by Minnesota, recording 11/2 sacks and performing a strange shimmy he doesn't have a name for yet. There was Mike Daniels, the one who said he wanted to "spit" on his game at Seattle and said he "sucked" at Chicago, leading the Packers with four hits.
Capers sent linebackers, sent defensive backs, and Ponder resembled a deer-in-headlights undrafted rookie. Not a fourth-year pro making his 35th career start.
The roof effectively caved on the Vikings in the second quarter. On first and 5 from the their own 39-yard line, Ponder's pass was tipped by Robinson and Peppers was there for the interception. He got a step on Jerick McKinnon, thee of 4.41 speed at the NFL scouting combine, and raced to the end zone.
Morgan Burnett pointed to the crowd, motioning Peppers to spring into the stands, and the rout was on, 21-0.
Two, three days ago, Robinson admits he never imagined making such a Howard Green-like play. He was getting reps with the defense, but wasn't positive it'd lead to a chance. And right after lunch Thursday, the Packers told him he'd be elevated to the roster.
"I saw an opening, so I just ran through the opening," said Robinson, undrafted out of Miami (Fla.). "Put my hand up. Knocked the ball down."
The next drive, Jamari Lattimore picked off Ponder and the Packers scored again three plays later. Peppers could sense the pressure was getting to Ponder.
"We got a lot of hits on him early," Peppers said, "got a lot of pressure on him and I think it affected him a little bit."
Glaze over the schedule. It's packed with quarterbacks who'll shred a defense when given time: Matthew Stafford, Cam Newton, Drew Brees, Nick Foles, Tom Brady, Matt Ryan and Jay Cutler.
For a defense that's been searching for something, anything opposite Matthews, Thursday's wreckage is about as good as it gets.
Midway through August, Perry could've been considered a player on the proverbial "bubble." Lifeless early in the preseason, he made a charge late. This night, he bench-pressed the 6-foot-8, 343-pound Phil Loadholt backward into Ponder.
If Matthews brings relentless, Peppers' athleticism, the Packers hope Perry brings raw strength.
The player who rarely frequents the locker room during the week was all smiles.
"It's just a start," Perry said. "I want to be out there and contribute like all my teammates. That's what I'm here for.
"I ain't going nowhere."
The Packers hope this pass rush isn't, either. Matthews has lived the ups and downs before, has seen these one-week bursts before. He expressed tempered enthusiasm afterward.
“Hopefully,” Matthews said, “this speaks volumes for where we're headed.”
Moments later, Peppers was more direct. It's here. It's always been here, he said. And the 34-year-old believes there are more avalanches on the radar.
“We've got guys who can rush,” Peppers said. “We've got guys who can come in off the bench and get sacks. That's not an issue for this team.”

Among the most daring and distinctive aspects of this book is Beckert's argument that literary theory can be used to analyze phenomena that economics has been unable to explain or predict. In essence, Beckert asserts that if readers are willing to accept that fiction plays a large role in capitalism, then they need to follow that insight to its logical conclusion by applying to markets the analytical tools developed for studying works of literature. While this may come as a shock to readers more accustomed to the dominance of economic theory in analyzing markets, it is an opportune moment to reconsider those orthodoxies, for two reasons. First, memory of the abject failure of economic models in the 2008 global financial crisis is still fresh. Second, post-mortems in the form of popular films like The Big Short and Inside Job keep cropping up as vivid reminders of just how much fiction was pumped into the markets and the media before the crash. Beckert's book, while far more scholarly and conceptual in approach, complements those popular works by offering a big picture view of the social processes that make such catastrophes happen.
In this sense, Beckert does for modern denizens of capitalism what Toto did for Dorothy and her companions in The Wizard of Oz: He pulls back the curtain on the great spectacle that has long enchanted, bewildered, and frightened so many. Watching as Beckert exposes the pulleys, levers, and other mechanisms generating market fantasies may elicit mixed feelings for readers. On the one hand, there is the emotional thrill of transgression (flouting the command to "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!") and the intellectual excitement of demystifying a complex process that has become increasing important in contemporary life. On the other hand, there is the dismal recognition that future-oriented economic fantasies—even at their moments of peak excitement, such as the bull markets when dreams of getting rich and enjoying unlimited potential seem tantalizingly close to realization—often turn out to be the creations of shabby little men manipulating the hopes and dreams of others.
To be sure, there are true innovators and creative geniuses, such as Thomas Edison or Steve Jobs, who have played their own, largely constructive roles in imagining the future. Beckert acknowledges these quasi-heroic figures and the ways in which they have harnessed the capacity for fantasy to make positive contributions to the world; they succeeded not just because they could imagine new and better worlds, but because they could convince others to share and support those visions until they became reality. But for every Edison or Jobs, there seem to be many more individuals who simply exploit the human propensity to project their fantasies into the future, without delivering anything of value.
"Are you at a computer?" asked Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School. I had called him because we had been scheduled to talk about the constitutionality of the filibuster. But just a few hours before our call, a madman had killed 26 people, mostly children, at a Connecticut elementary school. Neither of us was very interested in talking about the filibuster. So I asked Amar, one of the nation's leading authorities on the Constitution, about the Second Amendment. That's when he sent me to Google.
"Okay. Good. Go type in 'John Trumbull' -- that's T-R-U-M-B-U-L-L -- and 'death of General Warren' in Google image search," Amar continued. "Do you see the picture?"
John Trumbull's 'Death of General Warren at Bunker Hill'.
"That's the initial vision of the Second Amendment," Amar continued. "The good guys are on the left. They're the local militia. The bad guys are on the right in the red coats. They're the Union Jack. That's arms-bearing, Founders-style. Originally, the Second Amendment is very much about local militias keeping check on a federal military establishment. It's about Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill. It's a product of the American Revolution. The motto at the founding is when guns are outlawed only the king's men will have guns."
"Now go type in 'Freedmen's Bureau.' Do you see it?"
"The militia men have become klansmen. The uniforms have come off. In the original, very far corner of the screen, right hand of the page, is one black person. Now there are lots of black people. Now there's a uniformed officer keeping law and order. But as soon as the army goes, these blacks will be vulnerable. They'll at least need these bayonets in their homes or they'll be terrorized."
"In a nutshell, almost everything ordinary Americans think they know about the Bill of Rights, including the phrase 'Bill of Rights,' comes from the Reconstruction period. Not once did the Founders refer to these early amendments as a bill of rights. We read everything through the prism of the 14th amendment -- including the right to bear and keep arms."
"The reconstruction Republicans don't love local militias. They believe in Grant's army. So they recast it. It becomes an individual right. The NRA is founded after the Civil War by a group of ex-Union Army officers. Now the motto goes, when guns are outlawed, only klansmen will have guns. Individual black men had to have guns in their homes because they couldn't count on the local constabulary. It's in the text of the Freedman's Bureau Act of 1866 that we actually see the reinterpretation of the original Second Amendment. It becomes about original rights."
"The reconstructionists had had four bloody years trying to suppress bloody coups. So they tried to tame the Second Amendment. We moved from an insurrectionary reading of the amendment to an individual one."
I asked Amar what all that meant for the Second Amendment today. "Instead of obsessing over the wording of the amendment, which doesn't fit anymore, we need to talk about unenumerated rights in America," he replied. "Having guns in homes for self protection is a very deep part of American culture. You couldn't even get rid of those guns if you tried. It would make prohibition look like a day in the park. Today, almost everywhere in America you can have a gun in your home and that should be respected. But that doesn't mean you need guns that can mow 26 people down. We can talk about reasonable regulation."
More from Amar on the subject here.
New Ottawa Fury FC defender Colin Falvey has covered a lot of ground in the last year.
An important piece of two USL Pro championship-winning teams with the Charleston Battery in 2010 and 2012, Falvey added to his career highlights last season after the South Carolina-based club loaned him to the Kerala Blasters of the new Indian Super League (ISL).
The Blasters made it to ISL championship final where they eventually lost a close game, but Falvey's winning background had him on Fury FC coach Marc Dos Santos' radar and the native of Cork, Ireland was signed by Fury as a free agent earlier this month.
As Fury wrapped up its first day of on-pitch training camp at Gatineau's Complexe Branchaud-Briere, Falvey said he was grateful for one thing in particular as temperatures outside the indoor sports facility hovered in the -30C range.
“Thank God that we train indoors,” chuckled Falvey.
“I've never lived in a climate like this, never really seen snow like this.”
And credit to the 29-year-old, “cold” wasn't the first adjective that came to mind when asked what he thought of life in Ottawa so far.
“It's very pretty,” he said.
“Obviously it's cold, everyone knows that, but I'm new to it so I'm trying to embrace it.”
Falvey may also have to embrace being a bit less recognizable playing for the North American Soccer League (NASL) club as Fury works to grow interest in soccer in a relatively new market.
In India, Falvey said the excitement surrounding the new league was massive.
“It was absolutely unbelievable,” he said. “We couldn't leave our hotel without security, we'd get absolutely mobbed.
“Some of the lads who I have played with have played in the top leagues around Europe and even they were blown away by it. It was a really nice feeling to have that (because with) the level we're at sometimes we have to slug it out and a lot of people probably don't even know you're a footballer.”
With the Blasters, Falvey played to sellout crowds of 65,000 fans “with another 10,000 outside trying to get in.”
“It was the fifth most watched league in the world last year,” he said.
Though Fury's attendance ambitions for this season at the 24,000-seat TD Place are a tad more modest than that, Falvey was excited to come here and play with former Charleston teammates Nicki Paterson, Tommy Heinemann and Ryan Richter.
On Monday, the players were all excited to be out of the TD Place gym and on a soccer pitch, even though this first session was more fitness-oriented.
“It's good to get out here and get a nice (workout), get a nice sweat and just get on the grass a little bit,” Falvey said.
OLIVER ONE TO WATCH
Fury expects big things from Brazilian forward Oliver this season, but likely not as much as the 22-year-old expects from himself.
After a solid first season in North America with the expansion club last year, a few injuries prevented Oliver from really exploding, though he still managed to turn heads as he led the squad with seven goals.
But with a season under his belt spent getting used to the North American game and training on artificial turf, Oliver is more driven than ever coming into camp this year after some time off back home in Brazil.
Like his teammates, he was itching to get back on the pitch.
“We don't have much time, so we have to work,” Oliver said Monday with Fury's opening game a little over a month away.
“My first objective (for the season) is not suffering any injuries and I worked hard at that during the time off. I'm sure that the whole team will be stronger and we're looking forward to a much better year than last year.”​
FROM THE PITCH
Fury will continue to train at Branchaud-Briere until the TD Place field is free of snow, which at this rate feels like it should be sometime in July … Falvey said there are no shortages of “characters” in the locker room. Seems like he could be one of them. Asked about countryman Richie Ryan's thicker accent, Falvey didn't miss a beat: “He's a little bit fresher off the boat than me,” he said. He then stuck up for Richter, who is often left out of conversations involving Heinemann, Paterson and Falvey's championships in Charleston.
“Every time I get asked about former (teammates) it's always Nicki and Tommy (and) Richter loses his head,” he laughed … A familiar former Fury face was back training Monday with goalkeeper Chad Bush working out with the club. Bush turned down an invitation to sign for 2015, deciding to head to university instead.

Brian Cranston's recitation of “Ozymandias” in last year's memorable video clip for the final season of Breaking Bad may have elided some of the finer points of Shelley's poem. But it did the job it was meant to do -- evoking the swagger of a grandiose ego, as well as time's shattering disregard for even the most awe-inspiring claim to fame, whether by an ancient emperor or meth kingpin of the American Southwest.
But time has, in a way, been generous to the figure Shelley calls Ozymandias, who was not a purely fictional character, like Walter White, but rather the pharaoh Ramses II, also called User-maat-re Setep-en-re. (The poet knew of him through a less exact, albeit more euphonious, transcription of the name.) He ruled about one generation before the period that Eric H. Cline, a professor of classics and archeology at George Washington University, recounts in 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Princeton University Press).
Today the average person is reasonably likely to know that Ramses was the name of an Egyptian ruler. But very few people will have the faintest idea that anything of interest happened in 1177 B.C. It wasn't one of the 5,000 “essential names, phrases, dates, and concepts” constituting the “shared knowledge of literate American culture” that E.D Hirsch identified in his best-seller Cultural Literacy (1988), nor did it make it onto the revised edition Hirsch issued in 2002. Just over 3,000 years ago, a series of catastrophic events demolished whole cities, destroying the commercial and diplomatic connections among distinct societies that had linked up to form an emerging world order. It seems like this would come up in conversation from time to time. I suspect it may do so more often in the future.
So what happened in 1177 B.C.? Well, if the account attributed to Ramses III is reliable, that was the date of a final, juggernaut-like offensive by what he called the Sea Peoples. By then, skirmishes between Egypt and the seafaring barbarians had been under way, off and on, for some 30 years. But 1177 was the climactic year when, in the pharaoh's words, “They laid their hands upon the lands as far as the circuit of the earth, their hearts confident…. ” The six tribes of Sea Peoples came from what Ramses vaguely calls “the islands.” Cline indicates that one group, the Peleset, are "generally accepted” by contemporary scholars "as the Philistines, who are identified in the Bible as coming from Crete.” The origins of the other five remain in question. Their rampage did not literally take the Sea Peoples around “the circuit of the earth,” but it was an ambitious military campaign by any standard.
They attacked cities throughout the Mediterranean, in places now called Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon, among others. About one metropolis Ramses says the Sea Peoples “desolated” the population, Ramses says, “and its land was like that which has never come into being.”
Cline reproduces an inscription that shows the Sea Peoples invading Egypt by boat. You need a magnifying glass to see the details, but the battle scene is astounding even without one. Imagine D-Day depicted exclusively with two-dimensional figures. The images are flat, but they swarm with such density that the effect is claustrophobic. It evokes a sense of terrifying chaos, of mayhem pressing in on all sides, so thick that nobody can push through it. Some interpretations of the battle scene, Cline notes, contend that it shows an Egyptian ambush of the would-be occupiers.
Given that the Egyptians ultimately prevailed over the Sea Peoples, it seems plausible: they would have had reason to record and celebrate such a maneuver. Ramses himself boasts of leading combat so effectively that the Sea Peoples who weren't killed or enslaved went home wishing they'd never even heard of Egypt: “When they pronounce my name in their land, then they are burned up.”
Other societies were not so fortunate. One of them, the Hittite empire, at its peak covered much of Turkey and Syria. (If the name seems mildly familiar, that may be because the Hittites, like the Philistines, make a number of appearances in the Bible.) One zone under Hittite control was the harbor city of Ugariot, a mercantile center for the entire region. You name it, Ugarit had it, or at least someone there could order it for you: linen garments, alabaster jars, wine, wheat, olive oil, anything in metal…. In exchange for paying tribute, a vassal city like Ugarit enjoyed the protection of the Hittite armed forces. Four hundred years before the Sea Peoples came on the scene, the king of the Hittites could march troops into Mesopotamia, burn down the city, then march them back home — a thousand miles each way — without bothering to occupy the country, “thus,” writes Cline, “effectively conducting the longest drive-by shooting in history.”
But by the early 12th century, Ugarit had fallen. Archeologists have found, in Cline's words, "that the city was burned, with a destruction level reaching two meters high in some places.” Buried in the ruins are “a number of hoards … [that] contained precious gold and bronze items, including figurines, weapons and tools, some of them inscribed.” They "appear to have been hidden just before the destruction took place,” but "their owners never returned to retrieve them.” Nor was Ugarit ever rebuilt, which raises the distinct possibility that there were no survivors.
Other Hittite populations survived the ordeal but declined in power, wealth, and security. One of the maps in The Year Civilization Collapsed marks the cities around the Mediterranean that were destroyed during the early decades of the 12th century B.C. — about 40 of them in all.
The overview of what happened in 1177 B.C. that we've just taken is streamlined and dramatic — and way too much so not to merit skepticism. It's monocausal. The Sea Peoples storm the beaches, one city after another collapses, but Ramses III survives to tell the tale…. One value of making a serious study of history, as somebody once said, is that you learn how things don't happen.
Exactly what did becomes a serious challenge to determine, after a millennium or three. Cline's book is a detailed but accessible synthesis of the findings and hypotheses of researchers concerned with the societies that developed around the Mediterranean throughout the second millennium B.C., with a special focus on the late Bronze Age, which came to an end in the decades just before and after the high drama of 1177. The last 20 years or so have been an especially productive and exciting time in scholarship concerning that region and era, with important work being done in fields such as archeoseismology and Ugaritic studies. A number of landmark conferences have fostered exchanges across micro-specialist boundaries, and 1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed offers students and the interested lay antiquarian a sense of the rich picture that is emerging from debates among the ruins.
Cline devotes more than half of the book to surveying the world that was lost in or around the year in his title — with particular emphasis on the exchanges of goods that brought the Egyptian and Hittite empires, and the Mycenean civilization over in what we now call Greece, into closer contact. Whole libraries of official documents show the kings exchanging goods and pleasantries, calling each “brother,” and marrying off their children to one another in the interest of diplomatic comity. When a ship conveying luxury items and correspondence from one sovereign to another pulled in to dock, it would also carry products for sale to people lower on the social scale. It then returned with whatever tokens of good will the second king was sending back to the first — and also, chances are, commercial goods from that king's empire, for sale back home.
The author refers to this process as “globalization,” which seems a bit misleading given that the circuits of communication and exchange were regional, not worldwide. In any case, it had effects that can be traced in the layers of scattered archeological digs: commodities and artwork characteristic of one society catch on in another, and by the start of the 12th century a real cosmopolitanism is in effect. At the same time, the economic networks encouraged a market in foodstuffs as well as tin — the major precious resource of the day, something like petroleum became in the 20th century.
But evidence from the digs also shows two other developments during this period: a number of devastating earthquakes and droughts. Some of the cities that collapsed circa 1177 may have been destroyed by natural disaster, or so weakened that they succumbed far more quickly to the marauding Sea Peoples than they would have otherwise. For that matter, it is entirely possible that the Sea Peoples themselves were fleeing from such catastrophes. “In my opinion,” writes Cline, “… none of these individual factors would have been cataclysmic enough on their own to bring down even one of these civilizations, let alone all of them. However, they could have combined to produce a scenario in which the repercussions of each factor were magnified, in what some scholars have called a ‘multiplier effect.' … The ensuing ‘systems collapse' could have led to the disintegration of one society after another, in part because of the fragmentation of the global economy and the breakdown of the interconnections upon which each civilization was dependent."
Referring to 1177 B.C. will, at present, only get you blank looks, most of the time. But given how the 21st century is shaping up, it may yet become a common reference point -- and one of more than antiquarian relevance.
Garrett Holeve is a fighter. That much we know.
But how does the 23-year-old, who has Down syndrome, fit into the world of mixed martial arts? It's a question that needs to be addressed as the American Top Team member chases his fighting dreams.
In our latest installment of Ask the Fight Doc, MMAjunkie.com medical columnist Dr. Johnny Benjamin discusses some of the fundamental issues in the complicated situation.
* * * *
Doc, What's your opinion on Garrett Holeve – exploitation or empowerment? – Mick C.
I have no relevant knowledge or expert opinion regarding the motivation of those associated with Garrett Holeve, the 23-year-old amateur MMA fighter from Florida with Down syndrome recently featured on ESPN's “Outside the Lines.” The social commentary related to this feel-good story doesn't interest me much, but the potential medical issues are a very different matter.
Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal disorder in humans. Many people are familiar with the facial characteristics and cognitive issues (IQ) associated with Down syndrome, but some of the lesser-known traits need to be addressed when we begin to discuss potential participation in competitive full-contact MMA.
First and foremost, was there a thorough pre-fight medical exam performed by a competent team of physicians that included a cardiologist, ophthalmologist and fellowship-trained spinal surgeon to evaluate issues specific to people with Down syndrome?
I ask because people with Down syndrome have an increased incidence of:
Serious heart defects (about half the population with Down syndrome)
Increased eye pressure (known as glaucoma, which may render the eye more susceptible to trauma from strikes)
Ligamentous laxity (“double jointed”), which is important in assessing the safety of joint locks (armbars, heel hooks, etc.)
Specific ligamentous laxity of the neck (cervical spine) potentially creating atlantoaxial instability, which can lead to spinal cord compression and death
There is a serious debate that seems quite one-sided as to the relative safety of allowing elective blunt force trauma to the head of individuals with documented and/or suspected cognitive issues. Should you allow war fighters with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) to return to combat duties? Is it safe to allow athletes with seizure disorders (epilepsy) to compete in contact and combat sports? Is it safe to allow kids with cerebral palsy (CP) to play soccer or lacrosse? What about children with ADHD?
Not so easy, is it?
Currently, the vast majority of medical literature and professionals do not support the participation of individuals with significant cognitive issues or TBI in combat and contact sports due to the potential for serious brain injury.
In light of Holeve's case and potentially other ones, I have a few questions I would like answered:
Was a proper pre-fight medical examination performed with special attention to the issues specific to an individual with Down syndrome?
Were Holeve's parents made aware of the potential risks?
Does the Florida State Boxing Commission oversee/monitor amateur MMA – and how well?
Why do Florida and Texas seem to be such popular destinations for dubious promotions?
Why do so many people still believe that all state athletic commissions have the resources and are up to the task of safely and effectively regulating all of the sports in their jurisdictions?

LONDON (Reuters) - A 29.6-carat blue diamond, one of the rarest and most coveted in the world with a possible price tag of tens of millions of dollars, has been discovered at a South African mine by Petra Diamonds.
The exceptional 29.6-carat blue diamond recovered earlier this month is seen in this undated photograph received via Petra Diamonds in London January 21, 2014. REUTERS/Petra Diamonds Limited/Handout
The miner said the “exceptional” acorn-sized diamond, small enough to fit into the palm of a hand, was unearthed at the Cullinan mine near Pretoria.
The mine, owned by the firm since 2008, was also where the Cullinan Diamond was found in 1905 - described as the largest rough gem diamond ever recovered and weighing 3,106 carats.
Other notable diamonds found in the mine include a 25.5 carat Cullinan blue diamond, found in 2013 and sold for $16.9 million, and a diamond found in 2008, known as the Star of Josephine, which was sold for $9.49 million.
Chief Executive Johan Dippenaar told Reuters the latest blue diamond discovery could outstrip recent finds.
“By some margin ... this is probably the most significant stone we've ever, in terms of blue stones, recovered,” he said.
“The stones in the last year or so are selling well above $2 million per carat. That's not my quote, that's updating in the market,” he said ahead of the company's first-half trading statement.
Petra Diamonds is due to release figures on production and sales for the six months to December 31 on Thursday, but these will not take into account the find which occurred in January.
Analyst Cailey Barker at brokers Numis thought the diamond could fetch between $15 million and $20 million at auction.
Diamonds from both the Cullinan mine in South Africa and the Williamson facilities in Tanzania, both owned by Petra, have been displayed at London's Buckingham Palace and are regarded as among the rarest and most valuable in the world.
The 1905 Cullinan Diamond has been cut into two stones - the First Star of Africa and the Second Star of Africa - and form part of Britain's Crown Jewels held in the Tower of London.
Dippenaar said the company would decide what to do with the diamond in the next week.
Is this why voters have lost faith in the American news media?
In what some are now calling “Ice Cream-gate”, CNN's coverage of Donald Trump's interview with Time Magazine highlights an apparent “scoop”: the president is said to receive extra ice cream with his chocolate cream pie.
“Trump takes two scoops of ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, TIME reported, while everyone else around the table gets just one,” CNN trumpeted:
The screenshot at top has been widely shared on social media today, as even hardened political observers who thought they'd seen it all realized they hadn't.
At the original Time story, however, this was a relatively minor point, buried deep in a piece called “Donald Trump After Hours”:
The waiters know well Trump's personal preferences. As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be A Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else. The tastes of Pence are also tended to. Instead of the pie, he gets a fruit plate.
Does the president possibly deserve more ice cream? Have guests / staffers at the table ever thought to ask for more?

Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch has blocked a Palestinian children's theater festival from opening in East Jerusalem this Saturday night on the claim that the event was “under the auspices of or sponsored by the Palestinian Authority.”
According to Aharonovitch, the holding of such an event associated with the PA in Israel contradicts an Israeli law passed as part of the Oslo peace process. Aharonovitch's order bars this event from taking place not only in Jerusalem but anywhere else in Israel proper.
The festival was scheduled to feature performances at the El Hakawati Palestinian national theater in East Jerusalem, but Aharonovitch's order closes the theater for eight days beginning on the scheduled first day of the festival, which has been held annually for 18 years.
Preparations for this year's event began about four months ago, and the festival has been promoted over the past two weeks. Most of the shows, including puppet theater, were to be performed by Israeli Arabs. Foreign troupes from Norway, France and Turkey were also on the program.

This story "Israel Blocks East Jerusalem Palestinian Children's Theater Festival" was written by Haaretz/ Amira Hass.
It was a sunny, quiet morning Wednesday at the Western Forest Products mill and workers were getting ready for work, drinking coffee, some smoking, when the radio erupted with desperate calls for help.
Bobby Johal, a lumber grader at the plant for 30 years, said he thought it was someone having a heart attack.
"Then we got a call on another radio saying there had been gunfire, gunshots. So that's when we heard sirens … That's when we heard a shot in the office," said a shaken Mr. Johal.
Story continues below advertisement
Two of Mr. Johal's colleagues were killed and two others injured as gunfire broke out, first in the mill's parking lot, then inside the main office building.
RCMP says a lone gunman, a 47-year-old former employee who was later arrested at the scene, entered the mill yard carrying a shotgun and started shooting in the parking lot. A union spokesman said three of those shot were office administrators and one was a union member.
"One was shot outside in the parking lot when he was getting out of the truck," said Mr. Johal.
He didn't know where the other three victims were shot – but moments later he saw two co-workers running toward him from the main office, helping Tony Sudar, the vice-president of marketing for Western Forest Products Ltd.
The RCMP had not confirmed Wednesday the identities of any of those shot or the suspect. Mr. Johal said he was certain Mr. Sudar was one of those injured.
Keith Starkiewicz, who did some electrical and maintenance work at the mill, confirmed Fred McEachern was one of those killed. Mr. Starkiewicz stopped by the mill site late Wednesday afternoon to leave behind a large bouquet of flowers.
"I knew Fred," said an emotional Mr. Starkiewicz, 26. "I didn't know him [well], but I sat and chatted with him while I was working here, having a break or whatever. They're all good people, just trying to make a living for their families. It breaks your heart. Why would someone do that?"

Mr. Johal said Mr. Sudar was shot in the face.
"I'm sure of that. I saw him come to the first aid. I have seen two of the employees helping him, rushing him to the first aid room, which is right below the lunchroom in the sawmill."
He said Mr. Sudar was running, with two men helping him.
Within minutes the lumberyard was swarming with police, who cordoned off the dock area and blocked roads leading to the plant where about 75 people work, milling and shipping wood.
RCMP and B.C. Ambulance Service helicopters were soon landing or flying overhead and police began sweeping the area.
Mr. Johal said the shock set in later, when he learned that four of his co-workers had been shot and two had died.

"Never thought it would happen here," he said.
Within hours people had begun to leave flowers at the mill gate. Nanaimo is a city of about 88,000 that has been hard hit by a forestry downturn in recent years, including layoffs at the sawmill.
Nanaimo's NDP MLA Leonard Krog, who lost his own father in a workplace incident when he was a child, was reduced to tears at the scene.
"It is one thing when you have a chance to say goodbye to somebody, who has a lingering illness, who is old or ready to go, but all of the victims today set off for work healthy … and two of them are not going home. It's just awful," he said. "This is a profoundly sad day. We watch this on TV. This happens in other places; this doesn't happen in our community."
Charlie Gallagher, a supervisor with Western Forest Products Ltd. in Ladysmith, about 20 kilometres south of Nanaimo, dropped four white roses at the mill for his colleagues.
"I believe everybody [at the company] is as devastated as the general public is. It's an unfortunate situation today," a sombre Mr. Gallagher said.

"It's a sad day for Nanaimo. Very depressing. Very upsetting," said Nanaimo Mayor John Ruttan.
Early Wednesday afternoon, investigators in white coveralls could be seen collecting evidence from the mill parking lot. Several yellow evidence markers were visible between cars on the gravel lot.
There has been a long running dispute at the mill over severance pay for laid-off workers, but Pat Kinney, financial secretary for United Steelworkers Local 1-1937 said it would be unfair to draw a link.
"We don't know what the reasoning behind it was," he said of the shooting.
Don Demens, president of Western Forest Products, declined to discuss the ex-employee arrested at the scene. "What we're doing is providing grief counselling … It's very tragic," he said.
Major League Baseball issued a press release Monday to announce the formation of a new committee to improve the sport's increasingly sluggish pace of games. It reads:
Major League Baseball announced that Commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig has conducted a conference call with a new committee that will study the issue of pace of game. The goals of the committee will focus on decreasing time of game and improving the overall pace of play in the 2015 regular season and beyond.
The committee will be chaired by Atlanta Braves President John Schuerholz. Other members include (alphabetically) New York Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson; MLB Players Association Executive Director Tony Clark; Boston Red Sox partner Michael Gordon; MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred; MLB Executive Vice President, Baseball Operations Joe Torre; and Red Sox Chairman Tom Werner.
Commissioner Selig said: “We have the greatest game in the world, but we are always looking for ways to improve it. The game is at its highest levels of popularity and we will continue to strive to identify ways that can build on its stature well into the future. With the cooperation of all appropriate parties, we can make progress on improving the pace of play, and we will have recommendations in the very near future for the 2015 season. I believe that this group has the experience and the perspective to be mindful of our game's traditions while being creative about our approach in the future.”
Well good. Though, as Selig points out, MLB is doing just fine despite the near-constant hand-wringing about its imminent death, the league absolutely should be working to create a better nightly product. And that definitely includes speeding up games.
Even as offensive outputs have declined around baseball, the length of games has skyrocketed in recent years.
The independent Atlantic League tried out a series of changes this season to decrease the length of games. Some of those might make sense for MLB, but perhaps none more so than a couple of rules that already exist but are rarely enforced.
Pitchers are technically allowed only 12 seconds between pitches with no one on base, and batters should be limited in the amount of time they have to adjust all their gear outside the batter's box. Less time between pitches, obviously, would mean more game action and less downtime.
INTERNET giant Google is working on top-secret plans with Michael O'Leary's Ryanair in a bid to completely transform how consumers search for, select and buy airline tickets.
INTERNET giant Google is working on top-secret plans with Michael O'Leary's Ryanair in a bid to completely transform how consumers search for, select and buy airline tickets.
In a wide ranging interview with the Sunday Independent, in which he describes "running out of road" when it comes to being the face of Ryanair, O'Leary said the partnership with Google would change the way people buy tickets forever.
"There are some very exciting developments with Google, where we have been working with them on sharing the pricing," O'Leary said.
"We'll be sharing the Ryanair pricing through all of the Google outlets, so when you go in, there'll be route selections, the cheapest prices and so on. Google are developing a price-comparison thing themselves.
"They want to launch with us and we're working with them on that kind of product.
"It'll blow comparison sites like Skyscanner out of the water."
O'Leary said he expected the project to go live by the end of March.
"Google will say, 'Here are the fares,' then you click straight through to Ryanair or someone else. It blows everyone else out of the water."
The famously frugal Ryanair is not putting any of its €3bn cash pile into the new scheme, with Google only seeking valuable data from the airline.
"Because Google, being Google, want to show all of the prices from all of the airlines on display. They don't want to charge us, they make all of their money out of advertising," explained O'Leary.
"They don't want to have a limited or biased search. They want to be able to say they've screened all of these airlines on all of the routes.
"They need to find who has got the lowest airfare on these routes... and that's us."
O'Leary forecasts a technology revolution in coming years as Ryanair steams into mobile commerce and big data.
"In Europe, the flying won't change much but the distribution will change massively. It's all going to move to digital and mobile. The opportunities for ancillary revenues through mobile are enormous.
"In five years' time, everyone on Ryanair will be paying on their mobile. You'll pay for your drinks and snacks with your mobile. You'll upgrade to priority boarding on your mobile.
"We'll be doing more individual marketing, with the launch of My Ryanair.
"We'll build individual profiles for each passenger. We'll know how often you fly, where you fly, who you fly with and we'll design individual packages for you.
"For example, if you fly business 12 times a year, we'll say something like, "If you fly 13 times, here's a free ticket for your wife.'"
O'Leary also said that Ryanair's new website would include a slick 'Farefinder' feature, whereby customers can look at graphs on each route, showing the days with the cheapest flights over the coming 60 days.
The maverick airline boss also said Ryanair's move to soften its image and relax some of its less popular rules was part of a strategy to capture new passengers.
"We own the 81 million price-sensitive people or people who live around our airports in Europe, so we now have to go after the 20 million or 30 million people, the people who'd say, 'I'd rather pay €20 or €30 more to fly Aer Lingus,'" he said.

If you've already finished binge-watching House of Cards Season 2 on Netflix, you now have something else to look forward to: At the end of that series' season finale, Netflix revealed that Orange is the New Black Season 2 will premiere on June 6!
The first season of the hit Netflix series followed Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a happily engaged New Yorker who was sent to a women's federal prison for transporting a suitcase full of drug money across international borders for her now ex-lover Alex (Laura Prepon), who also ended up in Litchfield Prison. Over the course of the show's first season, Piper met many colorful characters, from prison stylist Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox) to commanding kitchen czar Red (Kate Mulgrew).
Though little is known about Season 2, several castmembers have confirmed it will pick up right where Season 1 left off, and (SPOILER ALERT) deal head-on with Piper finding her inner prisoner and beating Doggett (Taryn Manning) within an inch of her life.
GRAND RAPIDS, MI - Forest Hills Superintendent Dan Behm has apologized for the actions of a group of students who upset many during a Friday Grand Rapids football game by brazenly waving a Donald Trump political flag and a "Betsy Ross" 13-star flag. Grand Rapids Public Schools' Ottawa Hills High played Forest Hills Central at Houseman Field on Sept. 9. GRPS school leaders, parents and community members found the presentation of the flags at a game hosted by a predominately black high school to be inappropriate.

The scene was described as disturbing and seen as taunting by some in the crowd, and on Saturday, Sept. 10, it generated a social media firestorm. In a Monday, Sept. 12,
, Behm said the lessons we learn as youth is that if our actions cause harm to others, the impact is the same regardless of one's intent. "Injecting partisan politics into a community football game and into a commemoration of the events of September 11th is inappropriate," he said, noting that the actions of some and the inaction of others brought disrespect and confusion to many. "Parading our current United States flag in a manner that is inconsistent with proper etiquette is disrespectful to all who have served our nation. And, to wave a historical version of our flag, that to some symbolizes exclusion and hate, injects hostility and confusion to an event where no one intended to do so. To our gracious hosts--the students, families, staff, and community of Grand Rapids Ottawa Hills High School and Grand Rapids Public Schools--and to the student-athletes, coaches, officials, and supporters of both teams, we are truly sorry." Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been criticized by members of both political parties for bigotry and racist rhetoric. The Betsy Ross flag is controversial, in part, because it is embraced by white nationalist organizations whose members claim a superior birthright. Behm said Friday's actions are not characteristic of their schools, staff, students, or community, and they represent a lack of knowledge. As a learning organization, he said they have a "unique and precious opportunity" to continue to grow, build understanding, and demonstrate the true nature of their students and community. GRPS Superintendent Teresa Weatherall Neal thanked Behm for his leadership, his letter and apology. "I cannot deny the hurt, disrespect, and outrage that I and so many others in this community felt about these actions that took place in our backyard, in our home at Houseman Field," said Neal, who thanked those who expressed their deep concerns and disappointment about what transpired. "This type of behavior should not and will not be tolerated in our stadium or schools - nor should it in any across our state and nation." Neal agreed with Behm that as educators they need to use this as a teachable moment. She said they could work together with the Kent ISD and the Michigan High School Athletic Association to ensure everyone is better informed, more culturally sensitive, and prepared to create an atmosphere where everyone is welcomed, respected and can enjoy an athletic event together. Behm said the district's hope is that Forest Hills and GRPS not only meet on the playing field, but spend time building relationships that will unify the broader community. "I am heartened by our students from Forest Hills Central who have taken the initiative to reach out to their peers at Ottawa Hills High School," he said. "This work happens through unhurried dialogue, listening, sitting side-by-side, and taking action. This work does not happen through tweets, posts, political posturing, or retreating to our familiar bubbles.'' Behm said too much of the rhetoric in our society today, and witnessed by young people, fails to meet the standards of civic and civil discourse. He said our youth can model a different way. "If we create the right conditions, they can lead us from pain to progress," Behm wrote in his letter. "We can and will have dialogue about fear, justice, racism, rights, freedoms, responsibilities, personal convictions, and how--even in our polarized political climate--we can work to "form a more perfect Union."
MONTREAL—New Democrat Leader Thomas Mulcair said raising the corporate tax rate would serve the public interest because it would allow the federal government to pay for expensive programs like universal child care. “What we are saying is this: that we have lowered (the corporate tax rate) so much, to the tune of about $50 billion, that we have removed the capacity of the state to do a lot of the things that we want to do in the interest of the public,” Mulcair said Tuesday morning at a campaign event at a park on Mount Royal in Montreal.

“So, when we talk about quality child care at maximum $15 a day — 1 million places across Canada — part of that money is going to come from a slight and graduated increase in the tax rate for Canada's largest corporations,” said Mulcair. The NDP has long been known as a party that calls for the creation of large-scale national programs — they were the ones who pushed for universal health care, after all — but with that always come questions as to how they plan to pay for it. The party has pledged not to raise personal income taxes, beyond cancelling the income-splitting for two-parent households brought in by the Conservatives this year, and has promised to keep the expanded Universal Child Care Benefit as well.

It has also committed to lowering the tax rate for small businesses — one percentage point at a time — to nine per cent from the current rate of 11 per cent. That leaves going after larger corporations, which also has the benefit of being more populist in its appeal to voters who would traditionally be more interested in supporting the NDP. The Conservative government lowered the corporate tax rate to 15 per cent in 2012. They had previously lowered it to 18 per cent in 2010 and 21 per cent in 2006. Mulcair has not yet announced the rate he would like to see, but has dropped many hints.
He has said it would be lower than the U.S. combined rate and on Tuesday added it would be “far below the average that the Conservatives had for the 10 years they've been in power” and “well below anything the Liberals have ever had.” In June, Mulcair said in an interview with on CBC Radio that he would raise it to 18 or 19 per cent.

That interview also drew sharp criticism when he provided an incorrect number when asked about the current rate. Tuesday, Mulcair was vague when asked what he would do to attract foreign investment to Canada while also raising the corporate tax rate. Mulcair focused his answer on foreign trade agreements, an issue on which the NDP has evolved since its knee-jerk opposition to them. “We've been enthusiastically in favour of trade deals that were fair and that were on an even playing field,” said Mulcair, noting his party's support for trade agreements with South Korea and Jordan. At the same time, Mulcair said he would be “prudent,” such as when his party decided not to take a position on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union (CETA) before seeing the full text and expressed concerns over the investor-state dispute resolution. He also reiterated his concerns over the Trans-Pacific Partnership and expressed concern that during an election campaign, Harper would be more likely to acquiesce to provisions that would undermine the supply management system that protects egg, dairy and poultry farmers in Canada from foreign competitors “What is going to be on the table with Mr. Harper negotiating right in the middle of an election campaign? He's vulnerable,” said Mulcair.

PEOPLE with busy lives don't necessarily live longer, but they might feel as if they do. Our brains use the world around us to keep track of time, and the more there is going on, the slower time feels.
Brains were thought to measure time by using some kind of internal clock that generates events at a relatively regular rate.
To test whether external stimuli might also play a role in our ability to process time, Misha Ahrens and Maneesh Sahani at University College London showed 20 subjects a video of either a randomly changing stimulus – statistically modelled on the way that things naturally change randomly in the world around us – or a static image, for a set period of time.
When asked to judge how much time had passed, the volunteers who had been shown the moving stimulus were significantly more accurate. The subjects were also shown the video at two different speeds and asked to r ate the duration of each clip. They thought both clips lasted the same amount of time, even though the faster version was shorter (Current Biology, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2010.12.043).
The results suggest that the brain exploits changes in visual information, when it's available, to judge time, says Sahani.
What the developers have to say:
Why Early Access?
Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
What is the current state of the Early Access version?
Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
“Stationeers is an exceptionally complex game. By releasing the game to the community we're able to test our assumptions so far and ensure the focus of the game and our design decisions are in the right direction. This allows us to gain perspective on the game directly from our players, and factor this in as we develop new features, systems, and content.”“The game has been a very long time coming, developed after attempts at other games of a roughly similar nature. Basically - we're not in a rush! We have prepared a detailed roadmap of what we have plannedbut after feedback (and a dose of reality!) from our community we will announce a second phase roadmap. This means we're talking ata year of development in Early Access. If a year seems long, consider that the longer the game is in live development, the bigger the scope of the game can grow, and the more input the community can have.”“During development of Stationeers so far we have deliberately kept the scope quite limited, both in general features, design features, content, and usability. Working with the community we expect to extend both how you play the game (such as dedicated servers, rather than directly hosting), the way you play the game (control revisions, new mechanics and features) and why you play the game (new game loops and content).”“We've had a great deal of fun at the studio in the development of Stationeers. It's fully playable, and quite well optimized, for you in singleplayer or with a small group of friends in multiplayer. We consider what has been done so far as an entirely complete game loop and experience, and our work from here is about giving the game more depth. Significant work has already been done making the game robust, so even when there are bugs the game should recover reasonably gracefully.”“Our current plan is to increase the price, probably substantially, when the game is fully released. However no firm decisions have been made on pricing, and none will be made without publicly discussing with the community. If you have thoughts on pricing, please get involved here or on social media!”“The community engagement is an integral component of our development. We only want you to buy the game if you're prepared to roll up your sleeves and give us your feedback! We are experimenting with live development through twitch live-streams . You can watch previous broadcasts on the Rocketwerkz Youtube Channel . If you want to discuss the games development directly you can join our Official Discord . Use all these methods to give suggestions, watch the game grow, and find out how we're making the game even better!”
Medical workers of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy hospital in Monrovia put on protective suits prior to carrying bodies of Ebola virus victims on September 6, 2014. The death toll from the Ebola epidemic has climbed above 2,000, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on September 5, as it voiced hopes a vaccine could be available in November. The deadly virus has claimed 2,097 lives out of 3,944 people infected in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, since emerging last December, the UN's health organ said after a two-day crisis meeting in Geneva.

The largest newspaper in Liberia published a conspiracy theory accusing the United States of intentionally engineering the Ebola and AIDS viruses in bioterrorism research labs and infecting Africans with the virus through vaccinations.
The news article, “Ebola, AIDS Manufactured By Western Pharmaceuticals, US DoD?” was published by the Liberian Daily Observer on Tuesday. It specifically implicates the U.S government, Department of Defense, American research universities in participating in an “American Military-Medical-Industry” Cold War scheme to test bioweapons in African nations.
Dr. Cyril E. Broderick Sr. references several “reports” and the 1994 science fiction novel “The Hot Zone” to accuse the U.S. Department of Defense of testing biological weapons under to rouse of administering vaccination to improve health concerns of “black Africans overseas” and secretly attack the Soviet Union. One report links 1970s research that “made it obvious that the war was between countries that hosted the KGB and the CIA, and the ‘manufacture' of AIDS-Like Viruses' was clearly directed at the other.”
RELATED: U.S. Doctor Exposed to Ebola Virus Admitted to NIH
The article is penned by Broderick, a former professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Liberia's College of Agriculture and Forestry and a former Observer Farmer in the 1980s. He has also taught at the Agricultural College of the University of Delaware.
With a circulation of 30,000 – primarily in the Liberian capital of Monrovia – the Daily Observer is featuring the article on its front page and is being criticized for fueling an already rampant distrust of Western vaccination programs in African communities.
Broderick cites several prominent Western health organization for “selecting and enticing African countries to participate in testing events, promoting vaccinations” and setting up test spots for “emerging diseases, especially Ebola.”
Among those connected to the international scheme to test the Ebola and AIDS virus in Africa: The US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Md.; Tulane University, including a grant of more than $7 million the National Institute of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Doctors Without Borders (also known by its French name, Medicins Sans Frontiers); Tekmira, a Canadian pharmaceutical company; and GlaxoSmithKline in the U.K.
RELATED: Obama To Assign 3,000 US Military Personnel To West Africa To ‘Combat And Contain' Ebola Outbreak
Broderick said that African leaders need to protect their own people from becoming Western “guinea pigs.”
“There is urgent need for affirmative action in protecting the less affluent of poorer countries, especially African citizens, whose countries are not as scientifically and industrially endowed as the United States and most Western countries, sources of most viral or bacterial GMOs that are strategically designed as biological weapons,” Broderick continued. “It is most disturbing that the U. S. Government has been operating a viral hemorrhagic fever bioterrorism research laboratory in Sierra Leone. Are there others?”

GOP delegates at the convention, not primary voters or caucusgoers, choose the presidential nominee, another member of the Republican National Committee told CNBC, after a similar proclamation last week by an unbound delegate from North Dakota touched off a firestorm.
"People are under the misconception that it's the results of the caucus and the results of the primary that determines who becomes the nominee. In actuality, it's the delegates at the national convention that are supposed to pick the nominee," Diana Orrock, a delegate from Nevada and Donald Trump supporter, told "Squawk Box" on Monday.
Orrock's comments nearly mirror last Wednesday's remarks on the program from North Dakotan Curly Haugland, an RNC rules committee member. He went further, questioning whether primaries and caucuses should be held at all. He also talked about his proposed rule change to allow any candidate who earns at least one delegate to submit his or her name to be nominated at this summer's convention.
"Going into this convention they're going to try to do a lot of manipulation to try to keep Trump from becoming the nominee," Orrock said Monday. "A lot of political operatives in the Republican Party are trying to take Trump out at all costs."

Stephen Kingsley's first debut didn't quite have the glamour and glitz of his Premier League bow at the Emirates.
The young Scot arrived at Firhill, the home of Glasgow outfit Partick Thistle. Despite recent redevelopment, the 10,000 capacity stadia, now over 100 years old, is a far cry from the polished arenas the left-back will now be getting used to.
The closest it came to real glamour was in 2000, used as a filming location in Taggart .
In that episode, the famous detective investigated a fictional football club where an inexplicable number of employees were dying.
But it in the real world, it was the scene of two future Swansea stars first taste of senior action.
Jay Fulton had already been brought on for his debut by the time Falkirk conceded a stoppage time goal, their 2-0 advantage halved.
Manager Steven Pressley, once a towering, no nonsense centre-back, turned to his bench and decided to give this young 16-year-old defender his bow.
By Kingsley's own recollection, he was on the pitch 'for about six seconds' before the game was up and the narrow win secured.
Fast forward five years, and he can now claim to have gone up against the likes of Mesut Ozil, Joel Campbell and Alexis Sanchez, coming out with his reputation enhanced.
During the opening exchanges, he was under the pump as Swansea's midfield left him totally isolated.
Thanks to a tactical switch from Alan Curtis and the guidance of Ashley Williams, however, he quickly began to find his feet and grow into the game.
There were even a few daring forays up the pitch, with some testing crosses that had Petr Cech scrambling across his six yard box. Alberto Paloschi will have been watching from the bench, eagerly hoping that he can throw himself at a few of those before the season is out.
It is a dramatic rise, certainly, but Kingsley has also served a tough and lengthy apprenticeship to get his chance at the highest level.
A friend of mine, who spends his Saturday afternoons watching the lower tiers of Scottish football, must have watched Kingsley don the Falkirk shirt four of five times.
When I mentioned his name this morning, however, there was no recollection of a stand out moment or performance.
Steady growth seems to have been the key to Kingsley's story, which Swansea will be hoping turns out has many a positive chapter left to tell.

At such an early stage of his career, it is impossible to know how things will pan out. Scottish football, like its neighbour south of the border, is littered with players whose talent has flickered early on but quickly faded.
Kingsley's tale suggests he should be different.
THE EARLY YEARS - GROWING UP IN STIRLING AND FINDING HIS FEET AT FALKIRK
Born in Stirling, Kingsley played for his boys club until moving Falkirk at the age of ten.
He was part of a crop of talent to come through The Bairns' ranks.
There was Jay Fulton of course, as well as Burnley's Scott Arfield and Scunthorpe United's Murray Wallace.
Kingsley, however, also saw a number of talented youngsters fallen by the wayside, often due to a poor attitude.
Making his debut at such an early age, having seen some close friends not make the grade, the youngster knew it would be sunk or swim.
A HORROR START AT SENIOR LEVEL
Related: Why Arsenal FC should have fully expected to lose to Swansea City
A fortnight after his debut, it was a similar story for Kingsley.
Falkirk held a narrow 2-1 lead away to Stirling Albion when the left-back was subbed on with four minutes to play.
Two minutes later, he was off down the tunnel.
A two footed challenge of Albion's Michael Doyle, and the sixteen year old had his first red card in only his second senior appearance.
THE FIRST GOAL AND A TALENT BLOSSOMING UNDER PRESSLEY
Kingsley recovered quickly from that debacle, making 17 appearances the next season, netting his first senior goal against Elgin City in just the second game of the campaign after that.
Afterwards, he cheekily claimed that he had scored in pre-season, but assistant manager Stevie Crawford wouldn't let him claim his first goal in a friendly.
No time to celebrate, however, as young Kingsley dashed home to watch his crush Jessica Ennis claim gold in the Olympics.
He wouldn't score again that season, but never looked back.
The next campaign, he was named in the SPFL Championship team of the season. Swansea had wanted to bring him in alongside Jay Fulton that January, but were unable to agree a fee.
Unsurprinsgly, they quickly returned in the summer and Kingsley made the move to South Wales.
With Fulton and a number of young Scottish players nearby, he was able to quickly settle, even if that elusive Swansea debut was a while away yet.
SHOWING HIS TALENT IN THE LOWER ENGLISH DIVISIONS AND A FIRST TEAM DEBUT
The Scottish Championship is no place for a faint-hearted footballer, so Kingsley was able to adapt quickly when he stepped into League One to try and help Yeovil Town beat the drop.
He couldn't do that, but Kingsley drew high praise from manager from Terry Skiverton for his versatility and impressive performances in an unfamiliar midfield role.

He impressed with his creativity and crossing, a flash of which we saw at the Emirates last night.
It was enough to convince Crew Alexandra to bring him in earlier this season, and twelve appearances later, Kingsley's apprenticeship was done for the time being.
With over 100 senior games to his name by the age of 21, he was ready for his bow at the top level.
That turned out to be a bitter disappointment as his team were unceremoniously dumped out of the FA Cup by Oxford United, but as he did after that early red card, Kingsley dug in and soon found joy.
Perhaps it is best to let him pick up the story in his own words: "To get my Premier League debut and first start for Swansea at the Emirates with a result like that was incredible,
"I had an idea on Tuesday that I could be playing, which was a big shock at first but I'd been in those types of situations with other clubs before – albeit not on the same scale.

"You have nerves in the build-up, but as soon as the whistle goes you just concentrate on the task in hand and do your best.
"Now I hope to make more appearances. When Neil (Taylor) comes back into the team it is going to be difficult to get in front of him, but I'll try and take my chances when they come.
"It has given me a taste of what it is like, and I'd love to experience it again.
"Personally it was a great day for me, but it's three points for the club and it has given us great confidence and belief going forward.
"We worked so hard and the way we defended was very compact. We got what we deserved.
"With the shape we were playing, it gave me licence to push on a bit more. I enjoy that side of the game and trying to put crosses into the box.
"We knew it was going to be tough and they were quick out of the blocks.
"Our reaction to their goal was very good. We produced some good football in the first half and we got the equaliser.
"We pushed on in the second half and got a winner, which I think we deserved.
CAN HE BECOME A SWANSEA CITY REGULAR?
It is too early to make a definitive judgement, but he has as good a chance as anyone at staking his claim for a regular berth.
By his own admission, Kingsley has benefited immensely from being exposed to senior football from such an early age, shown on Wednesday night by the way he was not phased as Campbell continued to drive at him.
There doesn't seem to be much chance of him letting it go to his head, either, as he is regarded by many at the club as one of the hardest trainers and a very down to earth young man.
Crucially, he has made big strides in his physical development over the last year, putting him in a position to challenge Neil Taylor more regularly.
Only time will tell whether he can become a Premier League star, but the sub £1 million deal that brought him to the Liberty Stadium is increasingly looking like a steal.
Perhaps he can look at the example of Andrew Roberston, a fellow 21-year-old Scot left-back, who blossomed at Hull City last season and is now as bright a talent as any in the game.

When sculptor Kristen Visbal recently spoke about her Fearless Girl statue that, for now, stares down the iconic Charging Bull statue in the heart of Wall Street, she said it “reminds us today's working woman is here to stay and has taken her place in the nation's financial district.” It was not meant to be sexualized fodder for some sleazy man. And yet here we are today.
A photo captured by architectural designer Alexis Kaloyanides is going viral showing a suited young man allegedly humping the statue of the young child while his friends laugh off camera. Although he was only there briefly, Kaloyanides said he ruined the mood with his lewd act.
“There were people there talking about empowering children and women and for then to have this 20-something showing his entitlement, defiling the statute… it was utterly revolting,” she said in an interview with Insider Edition.
Fearless Girl was set across from Charging Bull by State Street Global Advisers, and meant to show that the corporate world needs more women in it, with the plaque at her feet reading: "Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference."
It's a much-needed reminder. The reality is that the number of women in senior roles is still low; State Street's own board is only 27 percent female and as ATTN: has reported on in the past, female leadership in the U.S. is small, compared to other countries. According to Business Insider, the financial sector is particularly homogenous: more than two thirds of U.S. executives at Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley are male and more than 80 percent are white.
Perhaps Fearless Girl can inspire more diverse hiring decisions, not only on Wall Street, but in other industries as well.
Bryce Harper named 2015 National League MVP
Nationals Communications Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 19, 2015
Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper was named the 2015 National League Most Valuable Player on Thursday night, in an announcement made by the Baseball Writers' Association of America on MLB Network.
Harper, who was 22 years, 353 days old at the close of the 2015 season, is the fourth-youngest player ever to win the MVP award, and the third-youngest to take the National League honors. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the only players younger than Harper ever to earn baseball's highest single-season honor were Vida Blue (AL) in 1971 (22 years, 64 days), Hall of Famer Johnny Bench, in 1970 (22 years, 298 days), and Hall of Famer Stan Musial, in 1943 (22 years, 316 days).
Harper, the first MVP in franchise history (Nationals/Expos), garnered 420 points in the balloting process, including 30 first-place votes, and finished 186 points ahead of the second-place finisher, Paul Goldschmidt of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Harper is just the seventh unanimous NL winner of the MVP award, and the youngest ever to accomplish the feat.
“The entire Lerner family extends congratulations to Bryce on his well-deserved Most Valuable Player award and his tremendous, record-setting season,” said Washington Nationals Managing Principal Owner Theodore N. Lerner. “It's such a pleasure to watch him play and we look forward to his future outstanding contributions to the team.”
This caps an award-filled season for Harper, who joins Hall of Famer Walter Johnson (1913 & 1924) and Roger Peckinpaugh (1925) of the Washington Senators as D.C. MVP honorees. Harper's 2015 season also earned him the NL Hank Aaron Award, a Louisville Slugger Silver Slugger, the Player's Choice Award for NL Outstanding Player, NL Player of the Month honors for May, three NL Player of the Week awards (May 4–10, 11–17, and Sept. 14–20), and the third All-Star selection of his career. Harper, who started in right field and hit third for the NL squad at the mid-summer classic, earned an NL-record 13,964,950 fan votes to be an All-Star starter.
“What a remarkable achievement for Bryce, to become the first Nationals or Expos player ever to earn the Most Valuable Player award,” said Nationals President of Baseball Operations and General Manager Mike Rizzo. “There has never been a question about Bryce's talent. It's transcendent. And to watch him put together the type of historic season he did in 2015 — at age 22 — only heightens the excitement for what remains ahead of him. We are extremely proud.
“I also want to congratulate Bryce's family, as well as our entire organization — including Bryce's teammates, coaches, support staff, and scouting and player development — for the role they all played in helping Bryce earn this distinguished honor.”
Harper hit .330 with a .460 on-base percentage and a .649 slugging percentage in 2015, clubbing 42 home runs, 38 doubles and one triple. He scored 118 runs and drove in 99. At the close of the season, Harper led the Major Leagues in a number of categories, including: on-base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS (1.109), and Wins Above Replacement (9.5, per Fangraphs.com). He also led the National League in home runs (T1st, 42), at-bats per home run (12.40), and runs scored (118), while ranking second in the NL in walks with a franchise (WSH/MON) record 124.
The youngest player in MLB history to club 42 home runs and walk 124 times in a season (youngest since Babe Ruth, who hit 54 home runs and 150 walks in 1920 at age 25), Harper is also just the second player since 2000 to accumulate at least 42 homers, 124 walks, and 118 runs in a season, joining Barry Bonds (2001 — MVP, 2004 — MVP). In a season that included a three-homer game (May 6 vs. MIA), two four-walk, four-run games (Aug. 18 at COL & Sept. 3 vs. ATL), and the 500th hit of his career (HR, Sept. 5 vs ATL), Harper solidified his place among the game's elite players.
This is the second BBWAA honor of Harper's young career, as he was also named the 2012 National League Rookie of the Year, earning that award after his age-19 season.
A published atheist who lives in Eugene on Tuesday threatened to sue city officials for permitting a temporary banner that encourages residents to attend church and celebrate Jesus Christ.
Author Ren� Salm said the banner, which is stretched above West 11th Avenue in downtown Eugene, represents a clear violation of the separation of church and state as outlined in the First Amendment. Other residents have raised similar complaints.
But city attorneys have said that rejecting the banner for its religious message runs afoul of the free speech protections of the Constitution.
The man behind the banner, Eugene resident Virgil Adams, said he has heard about the complaints about the banner and understands the concerns. But Adams said he�s within his rights to spread his Christian message.
�He can go and get a permit and do what he wants,� he said of Salm. �It�s a free country.�
Salm, who says he has lived in Eugene off and on since 1970, left his threat of litigation open-ended.
�I�m trying to find a lawyer who is interested in taking this on,� he said Tuesday, noting that he has contacted the American Civil Liberties Union.
But he said he�s committed to challenging the legality of the banner at some point.
�I feel like I�m being assaulted, telling me to go to church and celebrate Jesus,� said Salm, who has published �NazarethGate: Quack Archeology, Holy Hoaxes, and the Invented Town of Jesus� and �The Myth of Nazareth.�
The banner is next to the downtown transit station and features the words Christmas and Jesus in large letters, separated by a depiction of the Star of Bethlehem. Below, in smaller letters, are two phrases: �Attend a Church of Your Choice� and �Celebrate His Birth.�
The banner appears to be a last remnant of the decade-old effort started by Adams, 89, and two Eugene friends, Al Jagger and Willie Holmes, both now deceased, to keep Christianity front and center during Christmas and Easter.
The three men started Messengers of Truth, a registered nonprofit organization, in 2004. It sold or gave away beige lawn signs with religious messages for Christmas and Easter.
The signs were wildly popular. The group sold 5,000 signs during the first year after setting a modest goal of 500, Adams said. The group estimated that it has sold 70,000 signs.
The signs have dotted lawns in the Eugene-Springfield area, but also ended up in Corvallis and Beaverton, and even reached some cities in California, Idaho, Arizona and Colorado.
Adams, who started A&M Auto Body in Eugene, said the group sold some of its signs to overseas buyers through its now-defunct website.
In 2016, months before he died, Jagger rented short-term space to display his religious messages on 10 billboards in the Eugene-Springfield area and two each in Roseburg, Albany and Corvallis.
Jagger told The Register-Guard in 2016 that the signs are both a reminder that the United States has drifted too far from its religious roots and a testament to the power of Jesus Christ to shape one�s life, including his own.
�I�m nobody special,� he said at the time. �So what I�ve experienced in my life should tell people a lot about the power of Jesus Christ.�
Starting three years ago, Adams applied to hang the banner through the city�s program around the Christmas and Easter holidays.
The banner continues even as the nonprofit organization�s work has ended.
Adams said last he heard, there were $28,000 worth of lawn signs stored in a barn in Harrisburg.
Public records and social media posts show that Todd Cooley and his now ex-wife took over the nonprofit organization and renamed it Jesus Signs International in 2013.
The group dissolved in February 2016, according to the state�s online business registration database. Its website is defunct.
�It passed with him (Jagger),� Cooley said during a brief interview from his home in Arizona on Tuesday night. �We haven�t done anything with it in the last year.�
Three designated spots
For years, the city of Eugene has allowed community groups and nonprofit organizations to install banners on city-owned poles and across streets for up to three weeks to promote events.
The city has designated three spots for the street banners: West Eighth Avenue between Willamette and Olive streets; Oak Street between Broadway and South Park Street; and West 11th Avenue between Willamette and Olive.
The group or organization must submit a completed application and pay a $37.45 fee. It is responsible for installing and removing the banner.
Adams applied in July to hang the Christmas banner between Dec. 12 and Jan. 1, according to a copy of the application.
Last year�s Christmas banner above West Eighth Avenue created a stir. The Eugene Weekly reported that there were more than 140 comments and replies about it posted on former Mayor Kitty Piercy�s Facebook page.
During a February council meeting, Councilor Betty Taylor said she had received complaints about the banner as a violation of the separation between church and state.
In response, Kathryn Brotherton, now the city�s acting city attorney, said the city can�t regulate the content of any banner if it makes the space available to the public, so long as the applicant complies with the program�s rules.
�A banner advertising an Easter service and a banner advertising a picnic at Alton Baker (Park) have the same ability to buy that spot and be posted there,� she said, according to a video of the meeting available online.
Taylor then asked if the city would permit a banner for an event in support of the Klu Klux Klan.
Brotherton said yes.
�When the city does open up forums to advertisement and other things, we have those discussions � we have to be comfortable with the fact that we don�t get to read the content and decide whether we like it or not, or whether we think the city should have it there or not,� she said.
The program�s rules say the banner locations are only for organizations or groups �promoting a specific event or activity for general public benefit.�
In this case, Brotherton said in an email Tuesday, �the specific event/activity being promoted is attending church to celebrate Christmas.�
Commissioner weighs in
Last week, a day after he drove under the banner, Salm sent an email to Lane County Commissioner Pete Sorenson.
He wrote that he found the banner �extremely offensive� and said it was evident that it was illegal.
He continued: �I read somewhere: �Generally, courts will look at the particular physical setting of the holiday displays and evaluate the message the government practice communicates. If the display�s context viewed by a reasonable observer tends to send the message that the government endorses religion, then the display violates the Establishment Clause.�?�
Minutes later, Sorenson forwarded the message to Mayor Lucy Vinis and Taylor, and asked them what they can do to take down the banner.
�It seems to me to be violating the constitutional prohibitions against �establishing� a religion,� he said. �Please let me know if the city of Eugene will take down the banner.�
Sorenson didn�t return a cellphone message Tuesday seeking further comment.
Taylor replied: �I have tried before, and have been told that the space was rented. I asked if an atheist could rent it and was told that anyone could put a message there.�
Salm maintained that the city is on weak legal ground.
�I don�t think you should be able to put your religious views on anybody� using public property, he said.
Adams took the criticism in stride.
�There�s some people that don�t believe in Christmas and the Lord and stuff, and that�s fine,� he said. �And, of course, they have their own views about things. That doesn�t bother me. That�s their life they have to live.�
Adams said he intends to apply to hang the Easter banner when the application window opens at the start of the new year.
In the many Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them trailers, featurettes, posters, and Pottermore posts that we've seen in the last few months, a number of magical creatures have made pretty grand entrances. We always knew that the film was going to feature a lot of beasts and creatures, but through careful dissection of the trailers, we have a pretty good idea of exactly which creatures we're going to see in Fantastic Beasts.
Some of the creatures we've seen before — they've appeared in a handful of images and trailers and have been highlighted by Pottermore. Others, however, are our best theories and guesses, based on what we've seen from trailers and images paired with research from the original Fantastic Beasts book.
Sure, most fans know about the appearances of the Occamy and the Demiguise by now, but we may also see some Mooncalves, Jobberknolls, Fwoopers, and Phoenixes in the film. Here's what we think is going to appear in Fantastic Beasts based on what we've seen so far.
16. The Occamy
Seen in several trailers now, this creature is no secret. Though it's a graceful and beautiful bird with snake-like body that can reach up to fifteen feet in length, the Occamy is actually quite aggressive, particularly when it comes to its eggs.
15. The Bowtruckle
Eddie Redmayne revealed that Newt's favorite creature is a Bowtruckle called Pickett that lives in his pocket. Bowtruckles are tree guardians, and though quite peaceful and even shy most of the time, they become very combative with anyone who attempts to harm their tree.
14. The Thunderbird
The Thunderbird doesn't appear in the Fantastic Beasts book, but we know that it's going to make an appearance in the film. Capable of creating storms, the Thunderbird is a giant golden bird with two sets of wings and a massive trailing tail. It's also a relative of the Phoenix and lends its name to one of the Ilvermony houses.
13. The Swooping Evil
Another beast that doesn't appear in the Fantastic Beasts book, the Swooping Evil is bright blue and green and quote large. Described as “butterfly-like”, it's only large when in flight, bursting forth from a tiny object that we see Newt tossing into the air in the trailers.
12. The Demiguise
Exceedingly difficult to spot and capture because of its ability to become invisible at will, the Demiguise is sought after largely because of its silky silver hair, which is used to make Invisibility Cloaks. The Demiguise looks something like an ape with very large eyes.
11. The Billywig
Billywigs are bugs of “vivid sapphire blue” whose wings are attached to the tops of their heads. They move extremely quickly, making them difficult to spot, but they make their presence known by stinging, which cause giddiness accompanied by levitation in those on the receiving end of a sting.
10. The Niffler
We've seen a Niffler in several Fantastic Beasts trailers. A favorite pet of goblins that lives below ground, Nifflers are attracted to glittery, shiny things, which explains why the Niffler in the trailer is preoccupied with handfuls of jewelry.
9. The Erumpent
The trailer gives us but a brief glimpse of the Erumpent, but it's an immediately recognizable beast, as it looks a lot like a rhinoceros. Erumpents have very thick skin and great, sharp horns, and though they aren't known for attacking unless provoked, they are destructive. Not only are they a threat when it comes to charging and their spell-repelling skin, but their horns are filled with a fluid that causes victims to explode.
8. The Nundu
It's difficult to tell exactly what this beast is because it appears so briefly, but the closest match to the Fantastic Beasts book is the Nundu, which resembles a giant leopard. The Nundu's breath causes devastating diseases, which might explain the bizarre expanding quality we see in the creature's throat.
7. The Graphorn
Another beast that appears slightly different than its describtion in the book, the Graphorn we see in the trailer is enormous and has many horns. Though it bears some resemblance to a horse or a dragon, it's thick skin, like the Erumpent's, repels spells. Graphorns are very aggressive, and though mountain trolls have attempted to domesticate them as beasts of burden, those attempts have usually been unsuccessful and marked by bodily injury.
6. The Obscurus
We don't know much at all about the Obscurus. It doesn't appear in the Fantastic Beasts book, but we do know that some destructive entity in the city was referred to as “the Obscurus”, and one of the tracks on the Fantastic Beasts soundtrack refers to “The Obscurus” in the context of a “Rooftop Chase,” seemingly right in the middle of building action in the film. It's worth noting that Fantastic Beasts was also commissioned and published by the publishing house Obscurus Books. Could the Obscurus be the big, destructive, formless thing we've seen in the trailers?
5. The Fwooper
The most recent Fantastic Beasts trailer gives us a peek inside of Newt's suitcase. While there, we get a look at a bunch of beasts in quick succession. The Fwooper's only visible as a flying blur for a split second, but its distinct, bright pink color is a pretty good indication that it is, in fact, a Fwooper. The Fwooper song is pleasant for awhile, but repeated exposure leads to insanity. *Fantastic Beasts says:
“Uric the Oddball attempted at one time to prove that Fwooper song was actually beneficial to the health and listened to it for three months on end without a break. Unfortunately, the Wizards' Council to which he reported his findings were unconvinced, as he had arrived at the meeting wearing nothing but a toupee that on closer inspection proved to be a dead badger.”
4. The Jobberknoll
Another bird we're given a brief glimpse of may be the Jobberknoll. Their feathers are used in Truth Serums and Memory Potions, but the most distinct quality of the Jobberknoll is that it makes no sound at all until it dies, “at which point it lets out a long scream made up of every sound it has ever heard, regurgitated backwards. In the trailer, we see tiny, blue-ish birds (consistent with the described appearance of Jobberknolls). Their mouths are open, but we hear no sound. Very unusual, which makes us think these are baby Jobberknolls.
3. The Mooncalves
Though they look something like misshapen seals or living tombstones, the dark, four-legged creatures we see are likely Mooncalves (hence the big, full moon behind them). They're described as having “four spindly legs with enormous flat feet.” Mooncalves are responsible for crop circles and their silvery dung is actually quite valuable as a magical, supercharged plant fertilizer.
2. The Murtlap or the Nogtail
In an earlier version of the trailer, we see Jacob open Newt's suitcase only to be met with a smallish, pink, and apparently hairless creature launching itself at him. The best hint we have is something on the creature's back. The book describes the Murtlap has having “a growth on its back resembling a sea anemone.” That seems pretty accurate. Beyond that, the Murtlap is described as rat-like, and from the brief glimpse we get of the creature, it looks quite a bit like a large, hairless rat.
There's a possibility that it could be a Nogtail, though, described as resembling “stunted piglets, with long legs, thick, stubby tails, and narrow black eyes.” You decide.
1. The Phoenix
We've theorized that the egg in Jacob's hand might be a Phoenix egg, given the egg's color, size, and incubation requirements. But the trailer also treats us to a scene in which something gold and glowing is moving under the ice on a frozen lake. Phoenix tail feathers are known to glow — might these birds also be capable of diving underwater? Even if the egg turns out to be a Chimaera or an Occamy, we may very well see a Phoenix in Fantastic Beasts, and it could very well be baby Fawkes.

The business of running the country changed with the 2010 elections, according to a new book by Salon Editor-in-Chief David Daley. Well-planned, carefully constructed strategies that changed the boundaries of several key voting districts helped the Republican party gain control of Congress. Daley stopped by the Knowledge@Wharton Show on SiriusXM channel 111 to talk about the book, Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind the Secret Plan to Steal America's Democracy.
Knowledge@Wharton: Gerrymandering, the subject of your book, is a process a lot of people may not understand. It starts at the local level, which affects the state level, and the state level affects the national level.
David Daley: That's exactly right. It's a long process. Essentially what happens is, every 10 years the Constitution mandates a re-drawing of all state legislative and congressional districts after the census. The census is taken in years that end in zero, so elections that take place in years ending in zero mean more. They reverberate throughout the course of the next decade.
What's kind of amazing is that gerrymandering has been going on for as long as we've had a republic. You can trace it back to 1790 and Gov. Elbridge Gerry in Massachusetts. That's where it gets its name. It has been the source of all sorts of political chicanery and incumbent protection, or shifting a line to try and get back at a political enemy, for years. Both sides have done it.
What happened in 2010 and in 2011, however, is completely different from any other redistricting in our history. In part, because [conservative nonprofit group] Citizens United unleashes a flood of dark money into the system that allows the Republican Party to devise and execute a brilliant plan and a big political bargain. They go out and spend $30 million on local races in 2010 with the express design of trying to flip state legislative chambers in states where they'd be able to maximize control of redistricting that following year — in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, New York. They target local races with big national dollars. The technology of mapping has gotten so much better thanks to computers that it is exact and precise in a way it never has been before. There's so much information about us that you can add on to this program called Maptitude, which is what legislators and strategists used to draw these lines. You can add on not only all the census information, all the public voting records, but you can go out and buy all the private data sets that are available based on the information that we give up freely to marketers online every single day. This wasn't even available in 2000 or 1990 to this extent. So, what happens in 2010 is unheard of. It's a really well thought out and well executed plan. And it's had far-reaching consequences.
“… Elections that take place in years ending in zero mean more. They reverberate throughout the course of the next decade.”
Knowledge@Wharton: What is dark money?
Daley: This is political money that is contributed to a political action group, and you can't trace the source of it back. It's essentially anonymous money, and that's what makes it dangerous. The campaign finance reforms of the 1970s after Watergate were designed to at least have transparency so that you would know where the money was coming from. In 2010, the Supreme Court rules in the Citizens United vs. FEC case that that's unconstitutional. Corporations can spend unlimited amounts, and it does not all have to be explained away or made clear where that money is coming from.
Knowledge@Wharton: You write about how tiny Westmoreland County, just to the east of Pittsburgh, was an important area in the state of Pennsylvania.
Daley: It was. If you go back to 2010, the Democrats held a really small edge in the state legislature. When the Republicans who designed this plan, called REDMAP, tried to figure out which districts to target in order to try and flip the legislature that fall, one of them was a seat belonging to a 13-term legislator named David Levdansky, who ran the finance committee in Harrisburg. He was one of the people they took down with a really aggressive three-week negative ad barrage. It was hundreds of thousands of dollars at the very end of a campaign that he just never saw coming.
The Republicans were able to take control of the House in 2010. They had the Senate. Tom Corbett gets elected governor of Pennsylvania. Those are the three prongs of redistricting: the legislature, the Senate and the governor. If you control all three pieces, you can pretty much do whatever you want with those lines without the other party having any say at all. So, the Republicans re-draw the lines in Pennsylvania, and the first election that is conducted on those lines is in 2012. Now, 2012 is a big Democratic year. Barack Obama is re-elected president with 332 electoral votes. He carries the state of Pennsylvania by several hundred thousand votes. A total of 100,000 more voters cast their ballots for Democratic House candidates than Republican candidates in the aggregate. Yet the end result of this is that 13 Republicans are elected to Congress and five Democrats. That means 51% of the vote equates to 28% of the seats in Pennsylvania.
Knowledge@Wharton: What was the response by the Democratic Party? Did they not see this coming?
Daley: They didn't see it coming, but it's a catastrophic strategic failure on the part of the Democratic Party. In some ways, this idea could have been sitting out there for anyone to do.
Knowledge@Wharton: If we're talking about every 10 years when the census comes about, let's play this out. The year 2020 is not only going to be an election year, it will be a presidential election year.
Daley: It could conceivably be better for the Democrats because they tend to see better turnout in presidential years than they do in off-years. However, this is a state and a local issue as well as a big level. The Democrats don't simply have to take back Congress in order to change this system. They have to win back legislative districts and legislative chambers across the country. And they have to do this on the maps that the Republicans drew. The system is locked and knotted up in really complicated ways at a variety of levels. It's going to be really, really hard for the Democrats to undo this.
“Gerrymandering has been going on for as long as we've had a republic…. It has been the source of all kinds of political chicanery.”
Knowledge@Wharton: Was there anything illegal in all of these moves at the local and state levels?
Daley: Gerrymandering is not illegal. No. I would say that whenever courts have gotten a look at these districts, they have been frustrated by them. But it's not that the strategists involved did anything illegal at the national level. However, in North Carolina there was a case involving the racial fairness of these lines. A court mandated that some of them be re-drawn.
Florida might be the most interesting case. In 2010, the voters in Florida pass something called a fair district referendum, in which voters of the state say, “We want redistricting taken out of the hands of politicians, and we want it to be a fair and open and transparent process.” It did not work that way. The Republicans who were in charge of the state — some of the legislative leaders and some of the top strategists in the state — essentially conducted a shadow redistricting process and filtered the maps through citizens in order to get them introduced before the legislature. One of the most scathing legal opinions I have seen on gerrymandering was brought down by a Florida Supreme Court judge in 2014. He ordered a whole bunch of those districts re-drawn.
Knowledge@Wharton: You talk about a couple of key figures that were involved in this process. One that a lot of people know is Karl Rove, but one that a lot of people probably don't know is Chris Jankowski. Explain his role and how this all came about.
“The system is locked and knotted up in really complicated ways at a variety of levels.”
Daley: Jankowski is one of the most brilliant Republican strategists of his generation. The fact that he's not known is amazing because by coming up with this plan, he essentially gives his party control of Congress for a decade at the bargain-basement price of $30 million. You can't even run a losing Senate campaign these days for $30 million, let alone locking in control of the House of Representatives for as long as he did.
Jankowski runs something called the Republican State Leadership Committee, along with Ed Gillespie, whom folks might remember from his days chairing the Republican National Committee and running for senator from Virginia. He has this eureka moment in 2009, not long after his party has been swept out in 2008. He's reading a story in The New York Times on the elections that fall, and it looks ahead to 2010 and mentions it's a redistricting year. Because he works with all these guys on the state level, it occurred to him, “How about if I get some money to people at the state level and try and take these states over? It's is probably going to be a good year for us because in off-years, in mid-terms, things swing back the other way.” The party in control of the White House usually loses seats the following year. And 2010 ends up being a catastrophic year for the Democrats.
“These guys are using redistricting as partisan warfare.”
[Republicans] knew they'd have the wind at their back. They thought, “If we have some extra money and a strategy here, we can take advantage and maximize that wind and really have an impact on this before the next decade.” They also thought that if they took over state capitals, they'd be able to use those as a laboratory for conservative ideas and conservative governing over the course of the next decade, possibly even in blue and purple states. You see the results of this almost immediately in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina that the Republicans were able to take over in 2010. The legislature shifts sharply to the right, and you end up seeing anti-labor legislation coming through in states, like Michigan, that have otherwise been a strong union state or a strong labor state. Same thing in Wisconsin, where collective-bargaining rights got removed from public teacher unions, or in North Carolina, where the transgender bathroom bill just passed even though polls show 60% of voters in North Carolina are opposed to it. The legislature is so conservative that it almost doesn't matter. You end up with a strong shift to the right not only in the House of Representatives, but also in these legislative chambers in state capitals across the country.
Knowledge@Wharton: Let's talk about North Carolina and what the key element was in that situation.
Daley: North Carolina is an amazing state. You have two key elements there, and one of them is what happened in the 1990s. In the 1990s, North Carolina essentially has a congressional delegation of 12, which tended to be about 8-4 Democratic. When [RNC counsel] Ben Ginsberg and [former RNC chairman] Lee Atwater pull off their plan to launch all of these majority-minority seats, it immediately turns the other direction. It turns 8-4 Republican. You see a couple of districts that are represented by African-Americans, and you pack all the Democratic votes into those districts. Then Republicans took the rest of the state.
In 2010, you see the second piece of this. There's a guy named Art Pope, who is kind of the Koch Brothers of North Carolina. He works essentially with the Republican State Leadership Committee, and they come up with millions of dollars filtered through organizations called Real Jobs and a couple of other ones. They very aggressively target local Democratic legislators they think they can knock out. They replace them with Republicans, and they aggressively re-draw not only the maps of the statehouse and the state senate, but the congressional maps in such a way that it's now 10-3 Republicans there.
“We are the only democracy in the world that allows politicians to draw their own lines and choose their own voters.”
The only thing they had to do in North Carolina was take over the legislature. The governor does not have a say in redistricting. If you control the legislature, you get to draw the lines 100%. They brought in a guy named Tom Hofeller, who is perhaps the most genius Republican mapmaker of all. Hofeller does a PowerPoint for legislators in which he talks about this as if redistricting is a training session for master super-spies in espionage instead of the folks who are creating the essential building blocks of our democracy. He gives them advice like, “Don't fire the redistricting staff until you're 100% everything is done. Don't send any e-mails to anybody. Don't talk to the press. Don't leave your computer alone for a minute.”
These guys are using redistricting as partisan warfare. And they've got the tools and the technology to pull it off in a way that makes it more substantive and longer lasting than any other point in time.
Knowledge@Wharton: Many Americans feel that politicians have not done very much good service these days, no matter what side of the aisle they're on. The expectation is that this is not going to change anytime soon.
Daley: I think you're right about that, absolutely. We are the only democracy in the world that allows politicians to draw their own lines and choose their own voters. If we want the system to work better, you can't let the folks we shouldn't be trusting with it have control of the pens. Or in this case, the really powerful computer programs that allow them to essentially insulate themselves from the voters' will. I don't think we should be trusting the Democratic Party either to try and find a way to reverse this. We're going to have to take this back into our own hands.
There are states where there have been referendums on nonpartisan redistricting to try to get this out of the hands of the politicians. It doesn't matter if it's a blue state or a red state. If it's Florida, if it's Arizona, if it's Ohio, if it's California, it passes. People want to do this. I think we all understand how broken this system is, and that we have to find a way to fix it. It's going to come down to us.
I joined David Greene on NPR's Morning Edition today for 2 segments. The longer segment was a discussion of Stephen Bannon and his appointment as strategist and “equal partner” (according to the press release) with Reince Preibus, the newly minted Chief of Staff. Bannon horrifies many Democrats – and not a few Republicans – because of his previous role at Breitbart.
Their concern is overblown. Bannon is not the deplorable bogeyman described by Trump's political opponents. He is instead a big picture thinker and an effective political operator focused on promoting and enacting the policies that Donald Trump ran on during the campaign: an immigration policy that prioritizes the interests of American citizens, a pro-worker trade and economic policy, and an interests based foreign policy that is skeptical of foreign military entanglements.
I counsel that those who want to understand the significance of Stephen Bannon to the Trump White House should attempt to understand him as he understands himself. He has said of himself, “I come from a blue collar, Irish Catholic, pro-Kennedy, pro-union, family of Democrats.” It was not so long ago that described the base of the Democratic Party. In this election Trump won the votes of many people with similar sensibilities and similar histories. Ronald Reagan did too and confounded his many critics. Trump and Bannon are doing the same thing.
The earlier segment with David Greene focused on what kind of rhetoric we can expect from President Donald Trump as opposed to what the country heard from Trump the candidate. I argued that we need look no further than the President-Elect's victory speech the night of the election: gracious in victory, bold in his plans for the country, and yet still more accessible than his predecessors. Witness his opening comment: “Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business.” But the short speech was also full of uplifting statements like this: “We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen.”
At his best, Donald Trump, embodies the virtue Kipling described as the ability to “walk with kings” yet not “lose the common touch.” This will come as a pleasant surprise to those of his detractors that have ears to hear.
WASHINGTON -- We Are Kentucky, a super PAC formed to support the Senate candidacy of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes (D), raised $260,500 in its first six months of operation, according to a report filed Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission.
Labor unions provided the majority of the funds for the pro-Grimes super PAC. The United Auto Workers and the United Association, a union of plumbers and pipefitters, each donated $100,000 to the group. Jerome Kohlberg, a co-founder of the private equity powerhouse Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., gave $50,000; a trust in his wife Nancy's name gave another $50,000.
The next largest donation came from Salt Lake City venture capitalist Ryan Smith, an increasingly big donor to Democratic groups and causes. Smith gave $10,000 to We Are Kentucky.
Grimes is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as he seeks a seventh term in the Senate.
There are also independent groups backing McConnell and making large advertising buys. A former McConnell political director, Scott Jennings, launched the super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership in 2013 and took the helm of a nonprofit called the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition. Those two groups have already combined to spend more than $2 million to promote McConnell and attack Grimes.
Kentuckians for Strong Leadership reported raising nearly $1.2 million in the first half of 2013 from big-name Republican donors like the now-deceased Texas homebuilder Bob Perry and New York marketing executive Philip Geier. The group must file its FEC disclosure report covering the second half of 2013 by Jan. 31.
The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, as a social welfare nonprofit, is not required to disclose its donors. It is one of a number of new "dark money" nonprofits popping up in states with contested Senate elections in 2014.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
The Seattle Sounders have historically been one of the best teams in Major League Soccer. But this year? They have been horrible. It's a well-documented problem that the team has struggled mightily to generate chances. But on Sunday in a 3-0 loss to Sporting Kansas City, the Sounders hit a new low.
Check out the final stats of how the match played out:
Article continues below ...
It took a whopping 88 minutes for the Sounders to even take a shot, narrowly escaping the distinction of becoming the first MLS team to go an entire game without a shot. It was their only shot the entire game. Joevin Jones missed the target by several yards and earned a sarcastic, mocking applause from the fans in Kansas City.
Stats don't always tell the whole story, but in this case, they do a pretty darn good job. The Sounders were disjointed, listless and just plain bad. The team has unfairly counted on rookie Jordan Morris to do all the work, but is rumored to be close to signing Boca Juniors midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro and they do desperately need a No. 10 playmaker — yet, at this point it may not be nearly enough.
When you look at the goals that Sporting Kansas City scored on Sunday, it's clear the Seattle defense needs just as much work. Kansas City's finishing left a lot to be desired, but Seattle managed to shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly.
With the Sounders season already in jeopardy a full 10 points back from playoff position and the team getting worse by the week, it may mean the end of the road for longtime coach Sigi Schmid. The conventional thinking has been that Schmid would at least get until the end of the season after all the success he has brought to the club since it joined MLS in 2009. But after Sunday's performance, the Seattle front office may have very well seen enough.
The problem is, the best candidate for the coaching job was Jason Kreis, who built an MLS Cup-winning dynasty with Sounders general manager Garth Lagerwey when the both of them were at Real Salt Lake — but Kreis was scooped up by Orlando City last week.
If the Sounders have not started reaching out to potential replacements for the coaching job yet, there's plenty of reason to think they will start soon. Whether they make a midseason change or let the season play out, it's doubtful they can go on much longer without some major changes.
Schmid has been an effective coach over the years, leading the Sounders to win four U.S. Open Cups and a Supporter's Shield, but eventually all good things must come to an end.

The Oil Production Story: Pre- and Post-Peak Nations
In reviewing BP's latest Review, the big story for world oil last year was obvious: the USA's third straight record-breaking increase in average annual production. Just over 75% of the net increase in world oil production during 2014 came from the USA; add in Canada and 90% of the total increase came from North America. Throw in Brazil's first significant increase in three years and you have all the world's net gain in world oil production accounted for by three non-OPEC players. Production from all other producers combined was flat. So the question for 2015 is straightforward: will we see a repeat of those gains…and the flat-liners?
The second-biggest oil story from 2014 came at year's end: the oil price crash. While that event came too late to impact production data for 2014, it is already slowing the USA's shale oil train and dominating investment decisions–near- and long-term–throughout the non-OPEC oil sector. The early indication is that the history-making growth rates from North America during 2014 will be significantly reduced during 2015. If so, where might 2015 production growth come from?
In pursuing possible answers to that question, here are three additional trends from BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2014 to consider going forward:
Production declines related to violence and political upheaval in Libya, Syria and Yemen totaled 521,000 b/day during 2014 on top of 673,000 b/day drop during 2013, with Libya accounting for most of that decline. How likely is a reversal of that trend during 2015? Might production in adjacent nations be impacted?
Russia and China, the world's #2 and #5 producers, together produced nearly 18% of the world's oil. But recently, their annual gains have been shrinking: BP's Review shows Russia's gain during 2014 was 0.6% and China edged up 0.7%.
Iraq and Iran have the potential to make significant production gains going forward. Iraq increased by 144,000 b/day last year, its 9th consecutive annual increase, and BP shows Iran increased a notable 89,000 b/day after declining a total of 848,000 during the two previous years. What are the odds that production from either or both of those two volatile producers will increase as dramatically as some analysts hope and expect?
The chart below tells a story about: 1) nations that are past peak (see “Peak Year,” turquoise fill) because ot geologic limits (e.g., Norway, the U.K.), or for above-ground reasons; and 2) nations that have yet to clearly peak. It appears that 8 of the top 20 producing nations have seen their all-time highs in production. But in a number of these, production is temporarily increasing, with the USA leading the way.
Adding it all up, peak oil appears close but is not yet here, delayed rather than dead (as widely written in the media since 2012), and disguised by the inclusion of natural gas liquids in BP's accounting. Apart from the three items discussed above, there are upside possibilities (improved application of technology, new discoveries, a retreat from violence, improved energy efficiency, new policy initiatives, etc.) and downside risks (increased violence, geopolitical twists, financial system disruptions, policies, demand destruction, etc.). Despite all the happy talk about “American energy independence,” our petroleum future includes a peaking in world oil production, and the adjustments that is likely to require. Put this writer down for a likely (80% odds) peak in oil production between now and 2020.

About this Edition
The Effects of Nuclear Weapons , as a U.S. Government publication, is in the public domain. The 1977 Third Edition (the most recent version of this publication) was scanned by the Program in Science and Global Security of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University into a collection of bitmap PDF files which were linked to a Web page on their site which served as an index. For some reason the PDF file for each chapter repeated the title page, preface, acknowledgements, and table of contents from the front of the book.
The online edition of the book seems to have been removed from the Princeton site (or, if it's still there, it's sufficiently well hidden that I haven't managed to find it). I took the original PDF files and edited them with pdfedit to remove the duplicate material at the start of the individual chapters and break out the title page, preface, acknowledgements, glossary, guide to SI units, and index into separate PDF files. I then constructed a new XHTML table of contents (this document) which links to the individual chapter PDF files, which open in a separate window. I wanted to link the subtitles in the table of contents to their page locations in these files, but discovered that (at least with the Adobe PDF plug-in installed on my machine), a “ #page= n” URL fragment identifier only works the first time a PDF file is loaded—if you subsequently click on another subheading within the chapter you're presently reading, the URL in the browser window changes but the PDF file does not skip to the new page number. Consequently, I made links only for the chapters; you can scroll to the desired page for a subheading from the page number in the table of contents and the page numbers on the page images in the chapter files.
Devon Sawa is returning to our screens once again.
If you grew up in the 90s, you'll no doubt remember Sawa from films like Casper, Now and Then, and Little Giants. Or perhaps you remember him from Wild America, Final Destination, or more recently, from The CW's Nikita.
Next up, Sawa stars as Nico Jackson in the ABC thriller, Somewhere Between, alongside Paula Patton.
I had the chance to chat with Sawa about the new series, the challenges of working in television, and why his experience as a child actor was so positive.
For Sawa, being a part of Somewhere Between was something that he said “just felt right.”
“A few different things made me want to be a part of it. First of all, it was already picked up to series. It was already ten episodes committed from ABC, so it had to be special,” Sawa began.
“It's just one of those shows that starts dropping bombs on you and leaves you hanging and looking for answers, and that's kind of what I like in a TV show. So that was the other thing. And then of course Paula [Patton] was attached to it, and I liked that idea as well.”
Though he wasn't able to give away too many details about his character, Sawa did share a few hints.
“Nico Jackson is a private investigator, ex-cop, and he's just kind of getting by in life. He's got a serious drinking problem, and he's just kind of coasting. He's taking the easy road and just coasting through his days, and he gets dealt this hand of cards. It messes his world up, and now he's just dealing with it,” Sawa said.
While it was something he was excited to be a part of, filming Somewhere Between wasn't without its challenges. “It was one of the hardest things I've ever done,” Sawa admitted.
“I haven't done a lot of TV. I did Nikita for four years, and the nice thing about Nikita was there was an A and a B story, always. I was on the A story for a while, so you'd always have a couple of days off to learn lines, and go to the gym, and get your stuff back together before you had to jump back into it. And same thing with the B story — maybe a few more days off. But this particular show, Paula and I were the A story, and there wasn't really a B story. We grinded it out for four months — a lot of night shifts, a lot of rain. It was a tough show to shoot. And at the end of it we were both done. It was just like, ‘Okay, we're done. We're finished.' But it was worth it.”
One thing that makes Somewhere Between unique is that it will have a definite conclusion by the end of the season.
“When we started the first episode, we knew that in Episode 10, we would have an ending. That would be it. It's one and done. If it goes to another season — it's possible, they could think of another idea. Maybe they could change the whole thing like American Horror Story, who knows? But it's one and done,” Sawa confirmed.
“It's going to feel like a long ten-hour movie.”
He praised the quality of the storytelling as well. “Stephen Tolkin's ability to drop these cliff-hanging bombs everywhere is something that the audiences are really going to love. It's what makes the good TV shows great,” he said. “You'll wanna binge-watch the whole thing at once.”
The supporting cast was something else Sawa said he was impressed with. “You don't get it often, but there was not one weak link in the chain. Everybody, from the smallest part all the way out, was fantastic,” he said. “It all fit perfectly. The cast was very strong, and it was amazing.”
Sawa also reflected on the work he did as a child actor in the nineties, and how that path led him to where he is now.
“It's where I came from. It's what got me to where I am today, and a lot of those movies I'm extremely proud of,” he said.
“I think in my early twenties, I didn't want to talk about them as much. Listen, when I was twenty-two, the last thing I wanted to talk about was Casper. But now that I'm older, it's — that was my start. So I'm very proud of it.”
For Sawa, being a child actor was a completely positive experience.
“You hear these stories of actors that were child actors that didn't have such a great time, or there was whatever controversy surrounding it,” he noted. “But I really can't complain about being a child actor. I got to visit the most amazing places and work with the most eclectic and amazing people. I became the person who I am today because of that stuff, and it was all really a great experience. I don't know whether I'm one of those rare child actors that can say that, but I worked with some of the top companies, and it was always just amazing.”
“It's sad to me when you hear the stories about the child actors that have not such a great experience, because it really wasn't that way for all of us,” Sawa added.
Sawa recalled one encounter that involved some crazed fans during that time, though he said that generally, interacting with fans has always been wonderful.
“I remember one particular experience that was kind of crazy, was when we went over to London — Jonathan Taylor Thomas and I — and we were in a car that was being chased by fans. That was probably the craziest experience. But other than that, I've had pretty amazing experiences,” he said. “I've never had a bad experience meeting a fan.”
As he got older, though, Sawa realized he needed to take a break from acting.
“I had been going pretty hard from the age of eleven until about the age of twenty-five. And at the age of twenty-five, I felt a little burnt out, and I didn't know whether I wanted to act anymore. I wasn't doing the things that I wanted to do, and I stepped away,” he explained.
“It was kind of by accident that I got back into it. I got sent a script via snail mail and decided I'd put myself on tape for it. And all of the sudden, a week later, I was back meeting with managers and realized that this is what I want to do and that I just needed that break. I just needed that five years to figure out that this is what I really love.”
The decision to return to acting wasn't necessarily an easy road, however. “Once I did come back, it wasn't like all the doors had suddenly swung open for me. It took a little bit of grinding before, bless their hearts, the Nikita people opened the door, and said, you know, we'll take a shot at him. And now I've been working steady since and on stuff that I want to do. It's been amazing.”
Things had also changed a bit during those years that Sawa was taking a break.
“The one major thing that had changed for me was that I had never done TV before, and when I got back, TV was all of a sudden the big thing,” he explained. “So getting into TV was an adjustment. I had never done it before. I didn't know how quick it moved. The work load — the whole process of TV I wasn't prepared for,” he admitted.
“It was all a huge learning experience, and I had to learn really quickly. I did NCIS: LA. It was a part that was supposed to go further, and it didn't just because [when] I got to set, I was out of my element,” he continued.
“Once I got to Nikita, I kind of figured out, ‘Okay, you've got to be on the ball. You gotta keep moving. You have be prepared.' And then the rest is history.”
Be sure to catch Devon Sawa on Somewhere Between, premiering Monday, July 24th at 10/9c on ABC.

Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their system, either by locking the system's screen or by locking the users' files unless a ransom is paid. It can bring your business to a halt and cause significant financial damage.
Unlike the stealthier advanced attacks that can stay undetected on corporate network for months, the impact of ransomware is immediate and intrusive. Cyberattackers don't need a lot of money, resources or technical sophistication to use ransomware. Businesses are increasingly concerned about monetary damage, business downtime and other effects of ransomware.
Here are nine important steps, provided as industry information by enterprise security provider Landesk, that an enterprise should take to protect against a malware attack.
1. Patch the Critical Operating Systems and Applications
For most organizations, patching should be the first or second line of defense against any attack, including ransomware.
You can prevent many such attacks by ensuring that the OS and required third-party applications on each client system are up to date. You should also make a special effort to ensure that all critical patches and updates for applications such as Adobe Flash, Java, Web browsers, and Microsoft Office are kept current. In addition, you should prioritize patch and update deployments based on business needs and policies—and you should execute those deployments in ways that don't disrupt user or business operations.
Many organizations fear that comprehensive, timely, and consistent patching is too complex to execute and maintain, or that it may break critical business applications. However, using the latest patch management tools to scan for missing patches and deploy them to workstations or servers is a straightforward task—even in the most complicated environments.
2. Ensure that Antivirus Software is Up to Date and that Regular Scans Are Scheduled
If patching is your first line of defense, then antivirus (AV) should be the next one. Security researchers know by now that most ransomware attacks cannot be stopped by traditional, signature-based AV solutions. However, you don't want to fall victim to malware threats that are already identified and tagged by your AV vendor.
Ensuring that your virus definition database is always up to date on all your workstations is the most important element of an effective AV strategy. Good security management software can automate this process. Good solutions can distribute the latest virus definition file to all your endpoints in any size of environment very efficiently bandwidth-wise.
3. Manage Carefully the Use of Privileged Accounts
Minimizing privileges is an important tactic to protect against many types of malware, including ransomware. For example, a recently discovered ransomware attack called "Petya" requires administrator privileges to run and will do nothing if the user doesn't grant those privileges.
Removing administrator rights is easy, but balancing privileged access, user productivity and enterprise security isn't. Thus the need for privilege management solutions.
However, one thing to consider when protecting against ransomware is that many ransomware attacks are simply executables that users are tricked into running. Once executed, those ransomware instances run inside the current user space and don't require any administrator privileges to do their damage. For example, an updated version of the recent Petya ransomware attack has a fallback mechanism that allows it to encrypt files without the need for administrator privileges.
4. Implement Access Control that Focuses on the Data
An effective access control solution can help you protect against ransomware. However, if the solution focuses primarily or exclusively on user-access rights, it will likely prove less than effective.
Access control can be highly beneficial for protecting files located in shared drives. That's because some users may always have legitimate rights to access and modify at least some files on every shared drive. After all, most of those files are document files created by legitimate users. This means that a ransomware attack that successfully infects the system of a user with legitimate access rights can encrypt and hold hostage all of the files on all connected, shared drives and folders.
Compared to traditional access control, the new-gen method of data protection relies on understanding the behavior of ransomware and does not require creation and management of user-specific (and ever-changing) rules. It is therefore also easier to implement and maintain than access control based on user-rights management.
5. Define, Implement and Enforce Software Rules
Good enterprise software also makes it easy to define, implement and enforce rules that govern how other software behaves. Rules can restrict the ability of designated software to execute, or to create, modify, or read any file, or files located in specific folders—including the temporary folders used by browsers and other programs.
Those rules can be applied globally or to specific users or groups. However, before implementing such rules, it is important to consider the user experience degradation such rules can introduce. For example, when installing new or updated software, legitimate users are sometimes required to decompress ("unzip") or execute files directly from their browsers. Users may also rely upon the ability to create or invoke macros to do their jobs.
Software restriction rules may block these otherwise legitimate activities.
6. Disable Macros from Microsoft Office Files
Disabling macros from Office files will block many types of malware, including ransomware. For example, Locky is a relatively new crypto-ransomware that spreads primarily via spam with attachments. It entices users to enable macros in Word documents that download the malware onto machines.
7. Implement Applications Whitelisting
This solution effectively eliminates the ability of any ransomware to run, since no ransomware is trusted. It ensures that only known applications designated as trusted can run on any endpoint. The biggest challenges to the success of whitelisting are creating the initial list of trusted applications, and keeping that list accurate, complete, and current.
8. Restrict Users to Virtualized or Containerized Environments
In most cases, ransomware is distributed as an email attachment. Restricting users to virtualized or containerized environments will ensure that any ransomware that gains access to a user's system will do no harm to the user's primary work environment.
9. Back Up Critical Files Frequently
The FBI paper recommends using timely, frequent backups of critical files as a business continuity consideration. If done right, backups will save the day if you're attacked by ransomware.
There have been a lot of questions about the official response to Wednesday's oil spill and a legal expert says that legally, the response unfolded exactly as it should have.
On the Coast host Stephen Quinn spoke to Shelley Chapelski, a partner at Bull Housser, who specializes in maritime law.
Legally, who is in charge?
There are two organizations: Transport Canada and the Canadian Coast Guard. Transport Canada organizes the overall framework of oil spill response, but when there is an incident it is the Canadian Coast Guard.
What role does the province and the city play?
It's a matter of shipping and navigation, which under the Canadian constitution, falls within the federal jurisdiction. Other than being claimants if they suffer damages per se, the city and province do not have a direct role.
Even though the bunker fuel is washing up on the beaches of a couple of municipalities?
The ship has the ultimate responsibility for paying for all claims and paying for all of the cleanup and will probably face a fine.
Are there any circumstances under which the city of Vancouver could hold upper levels of government responsible for damage to its shoreline?
The city would have to show that the federal government was responsible for having caused the damage in the first instance. The cleanup organization, the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation, has to abide by time response guidelines established by Transport Canada in consultation with provincial governments and other organizations.
The WCMRC maintains an incredible amount of equipment, vessels; they have a core full-time staff and up to 500 volunteers available to respond to a spill. Transport Canada established certain response deadlines which they are supposed to meet, and that is six hours for a spill this size. They can identify the resources they need, marshal the resources and volunteers, get the equipment on the water to respond.
Previous Next
When a spill does occur, how does the investigation into what happened unfold?
Coast Guard will look into what occurred. Transport Canada, which is responsible for ship safety and the seaworthiness of the ship will look into it. The Transportation Safety Board will also conduct an investigation if the spill is significant enough and there may be safety lessons to learn.
If a ship denies responsibility, what happens?
In this case, the ship did not immediately take responsibility, but subsequently the shipowner publicly acknowledged that the bunker fuel came from its vessel..... In circumstances when no one takes responsibility, investigations will be undertaken by the Coast Guard and Transport Canada. In situations where there may be multiple vessels in a marina that may be the source, they'll take samples of the fuel in the water and the fuel in the vessels to see if they can match it. Often times they can find where the fuel is coming from the vessel.
Ultimately, if it cannot be proven which vessel is responsible for the pollution, Canadians can rely on the Ship-source Oil Pollution fund to indemnify them for any cleanup costs
Is compensation complicated if it is a foreign vessel?
Not at all. In order to enter Canadian waters, vessels need to carry certificates of financial responsibility to deal with these types of circumstances and if the government had any concern about the ship's commitment to pay costs, they can demand security before the vessel leaves port.
Could Canadian maritime law be improved to prevent incidents like this from happening again?
International shipping is an integral part of our economy. Shipping cannot be conducted without some degree of risk. All we can do as Canadians is minimize the risk and ensure that when the risks turn into realities, there is a response prepared and in position to minimize the impact of the incident.That is exactly what happened in this particular case. Relatively speaking, it's a non-event.

Breen's 'new chapter' in Sweden
As he prepares to make his competitive debut in Citroën's C3 WRC at Rally Sweden, Craig Breen says he is starting a new chapter in his career.
The Irishman will step up to a C3 this weekend after driving a 2016-spec DS 3 to an impressive fifth place at January's Rallye Monte-Carlo.
"Now I get to try the big car - which feels like I'm having an affair with the other car's sister," Breen joked today.
"It's an awesome feeling. The car is fantastic to drive and I'm taking so much pleasure from every kilometre behind the wheel. Starting a new chapter in my career here in Sweden is something I'm really happy about."
Breen and his co-driver Scott Martin got off to a great start at the pre-event Shakedown, recording the best performance for the Citroën Total Abu Dhabi WRT with the second fastest time overall, a tenth of a second off Mads Østberg's lead pace.
He said: "Shakedown was really good. Scott and I felt we had a good rhythm and the car was going well. I feel a bit like a child waiting for Christmas morning now - I just want to get started."
Sweden is a rally Breen knows well, and he has tackled it more times than his team-mates Kris Meeke and Stéphane Lefebvre.
"This is my fifth time doing this rally, and it's the rally where I have the most experience. In theory, that should mean I can do someting special, but at the same time it's a big step up," he explained.
"Even though it's my third time here in a World Rally Car it's only my ninth rally ever in a World Rally Car - so we still have a lot of things to learn."
Ahead of his first stage in the C3, Thursday night's Super Special at Karlstad racecourse, Breen said he was keeping his nerves under control:
"This chance is something I've waited all my life for, so of course I'm a bit nervous, but whenever the nerves kick in and I feel under pressure, I always go back to the same thing: The chance to drive these cars and be part of this team is so rare, so unique, there's no point in getting clouded over by the pressure or stressed. You might as well get out there and enjoy the thing.
"You're getting to drive hundreds of thousands of Euros worth of World Rally Car down some of the best stages in the world, so you may as well have a spring in your step and enjoy it. And if the result is good, then we have a few beers at the end. If not, then we have to work a bit harder. It's the best job in the world."

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. - Far from a leisurely grip-and-grin at a downtown cafe, Governor Rick Perry of Texas encountered a wall of protesters and faced sharp questions in a morning campaign stop in Portsmouth yesterday, his second day in New Hampshire.
Hecklers carrying signs shouted from the sidewalk, “Stop attacking middle-class families, Rick Perry,'' as the smiling new presidential candidate shook hands and signed autographs. Perry, who declared his candidacy on Saturday, was much more warmly received at visits yesterday to Dover and Pembroke.
For every admirer in Portsmouth who commended his work, there were several detractors armed with questions about climate change, Social Security, or human evolution.
“How old do you think the Earth is?'' asked a little boy as his mother egged him on.
“You know what, I don't have any idea,'' Perry responded, hunched at eye-level. “I know it's pretty old. It goes back a long, long way. I'm not sure anybody actually knows completely and absolutely.''
He added that evolution is “a theory that's out there, and it's got some gaps in it.''
“Ask him why he doesn't believe in science,'' the mother prompted.
The New Hampshire Alliance for Retired Americans organized at least part of the protest, according to the Associated Press.
For his part, Perry shied from conversations about his scientific views and focused on jobs and the economy, blasting the Obama administration for too much regulation and taxation. Those ideas resonated with many who came to see him at a diner in Dover.
“We need government out of the way because the private sector is the solution,'' he told a crowd at Epoch Homes' modular home factory in Pembroke.
William O'Brien, the Republican House speaker in New Hampshire, said Perry's recent controversial statements - doubting the existence of global warming and warning that any action to bolster the money supply by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would be treasonous - will not be sticking points for the state's GOP voters.
“I think we still have a concern in New Hampshire about jobs,'' O'Brien said after Perry's question-and-answer session in Pembroke. “We have a concern in New Hampshire about our young people leaving the state.''

Democrats accepting PAC funds, data suggest WASHINGTON - President Obama has sworn off special-interest money to pay for his reelection bid. But it turns out those dollars are fair game for congressional Democrats - to the tune of millions.
An Associated Press analysis of campaign fund-raising found that Democrats who are trying to regain control of the House next fall have raked in more than $15 million from political action committees this year, raising money from special interests even as Obama promotes his ban on such funds.
More than $1 million of that money flowed to the reelection committees of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi of California, minority whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, and the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.
Democratic leaders gloss over all that when they pressure the GOP presidential candidates to disclose their top donors, and even go so far as to trumpet the fact that Obama's campaign and the DNC do not take money from registered federal lobbyists and political action committees.
Yet the checks still flowed to congressional Democrats, at roughly the same pace as they did in the last election cycle two years ago. And dozens of House Democrats even raised more interest-group money than they did during first six months in 2009, the most recent comparable period, when adjusted for inflation.
“Democrats have broadly supported campaign finance reform and disclosure for outside groups, while Republicans continue to oppose them,'' DNC spokesman Alec Gerlach said. “The DNC has refused PAC and lobbyist money since President Obama was elected, and Wasserman Schultz has refused it as well since she was elected DNC chair'' in May.
It is a bipartisan money game, with top Republicans also cashing checks from special interests in 2011. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has pulled in more than $500,000 from PACs since Jan. 1, as has his deputy, majority leader Eric Cantor of Virginia.
But Democrats have been on the offensive across the country, criticizing streams of cash flowing into federal elections following the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on corporate donations in political campaigns.
Huntsman turns to Twitter to blast Perry's views SALT LAKE CITY - Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman is turning to Twitter to level criticism against a rival, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, and his positions on evolution and climate change.
Huntsman said in a tweet yesterday that he trusts scientists on global warming and believes in evolution: “Call me crazy.''
The former Utah governor's tweet came after Perry said earlier this week that climate change is unproven. Huntsman has since gained more than 3,000 Twitter followers.

Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press Neil Heslin, the father of 6-year-old Newtown victim Jesse Lewis, left, and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz) stand by President Barack Obama during a news conference at the White House on April 17, 2013. The administration will use an empty seat at the State of the Union to honor those killed by gun violence.
WASHINGTON -- The White House spends a considerable amount of attention each year on who will receive the honor of sitting with the first lady during the State of the Union address. These are some of the most high-profile spots in the chamber, and the guests usually reflect a message or policy priority that the president will discuss.
This year, however, the first lady's box will be most notable for who is not there: The White House will be leaving a seat empty at Tuesday's event to honor people who have died due to gun violence.
President Barack Obama made the announcement on a conference call with grassroots supporters Friday, where he discussed the steps he's taking to address gun violence.
A White House official said the seat will be left empty to give victims a voice, "because they need the rest of us to speak for them. To tell their stories. To honor their memory. To support the Americans whose lives have been forever changed by the terrible ripple effect of gun violence -- survivors who've had to learn to live with a disability, or without the love of their life. To remind every single one of our representatives that it's their responsibility to do something about this."
Obama kicked off his last year in office this week by announcing that he was taking executive action on gun control, since Congress has refused to pass legislation doing so. His measures are designed to close holes in the federal background check system for gun purchases, devote millions of additional dollars to mental health services and kick-start so-called smart gun technology.
"The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage. We do not need to accept this carnage as the price of freedom," Obama said during his remarks at the White House.

LISBON, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 85 percent of mainland Portugal is suffering from severe drought, the Portuguese Institute of Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) said in a statement on Friday.
According to the Palmer Drought Severity Index used by the IPMA, 81 percent of the mainland is experiencing severe drought and 7.4 percent extreme drought. The latter classification is the worst on the scale.
Average rainfall in Portugal in September was at its lowest level for the month in 87 years, while precipitation in the April to September period was the second lowest ever recorded after 2005.
Meanwhile, it was the hottest September in 87 years, in terms of average maximum temperatures, and the April to September period saw the highest average maximums since 1931.
The combination of low rainfall and high temperatures has severely reduced the soil water content. Farmers in the worst effected areas have been promised state assistance and the Reservoir Management Commission is drafting plans to minimize water shortage issues.
The hot temperatures have played their role in what has been a devastating year for forest fires in Portugal. In another report published on Friday, the Institute for Forest Conservation revealed that more than 215,000 hectares have burned in 2017, double the yearly average.
The worst of the fires killed 64 people in June in Pedrogao Grande area in central Portugal.
There appears to be no imminent let up in the hot weather with temperatures as high as 37 degrees Celsius forecast in the coming days. Some 70 parishes have been placed on maximum wild fire alert.
Nestlé introduces bottled water for "trendy, high-income" women Finally, H2O made specifically for the ladies
Ladies, if you're lucky enough to live somewhere with access to clean drinking water, then you know that the stuff coming straight from your tap is enough to keep you alive in a purely physiological sense. But can you "live your best life" while drinking H2O from the sink? Can you "have it all" while drinking off-brand bottled water you bought at the deli?
The answer is no, you can't.

And Nestlé knows that, which is why the company launched "Resource" on Monday, premium water made specifically for “a woman who is a little more on the trendy side and higher-income side,” according to Larry Cooper, group marketing manager for Resource.
Resource is more than just a beverage, it's a reflection of who you are as a woman in the very deepest and most personal sense of your very being, as Cooper went on to explain to the New York Times: “We want to raise it to the level of a lifestyle brand,” he said, “where she's proud to carry around Resource as her bottled water accessory, so to speak.”
Who is the Resource woman, you ask? Well, according to the promotional video, she loves yoga, nature and controlled acrobatics set to ambient techno.

Disco – Hey everybody! Welcome to Around the ‘Verse!
Welcome to Reverse the ‘Verse. We've got Disco and Ben. And I see Justin in the background. They're still blaring the music though, so it's very hard to hear anything.
Disco looks all professional today for some reason.
And the music is stopped, thankfully.
Quite a week. Second week of celebrating AtV 100. Yesterdays episode was… quite an episode. First looks at Bengal, GrimHex, and some stuff that should not have been in there…
AtV 100 was originally planned to be a giant blowout. 2-3 hour episode, they wanted to try to kill INN with the amount of transcribing they would have had to do, but They changed it now, so there's one per studio, so we can manage now. LA did part one, UK did part 2, Austin is part 3, and Frankfurt is part 4. They're experimenting with a lot of new video stuff, trying to lock things down when it comes to new video content.
‘Are marshmallows happy?'
They're talking about Ghostbusters now.
Lots of work being done on the monthly report, it's pretty much done, will come out later today. Lots of text. It should be out around mid-day. Chris and Legal have done their reviews, should be out an hour or two after RtV.
Toast and Disco are roommates. Toast was doing his review yesterday, and toast was reading, reading, reading, ‘Oh are we allowed to say this?'
The background noise in the room is the air conditioner. It's very hot there today, so they're running the AC, regardless.
Monthly report this week. 4th of July was this week. Ben hasn't been around in two weeks for RtV. Last week Ben took 3 days off to spend time with Alexis' mom to do California stuff. Went to some museums. Went to the Getti Villa or something. Went antiquing.
This week though Ben mostly did ship stuff. Lots of ship stuff. Some eagle-eyed viewers saw some ship stuff in AtV yesterday.
First look in AtV at GrimHex, first look at 2.5. Probably see some more GrimHex next week from Austin, looking at lighting and such. There are some images in the report as well.
Ben has decided the lore team should be called loreos TM
Disco likes being liked by writers, and thinks they should be called writers.
Where's my Spaceship!
Next concept sale will be the Argo. It's not quite a concept sale as it'll be ready to go with 2.5. It's not a big ship roll out, but there'll be roles for the Argo though. People want the Argo, so it's coming. There are three variants. Two will be ready and will be sold. We saw the Argo in the Morrow tour.
Morrow tour – It's what's for dinner.
Carrack – no change. It's the next they'll look at after the Cat. The Cat is doing really well, looking very cool. In the tour of the UK office, Nathan Diersley talked about the ship team – 21 artists. Lots of them working on SQ42 specific ships. Bengal, Vanduul fleet, etc… When they're done with those, they get to start making Star citizenships.
Spoiler warning- SQ42 will be finished.
They're also going to be refining RtV, so they'll probably have a list of ships that they should cover each time. Ben made a Terrapin pun.
Moving on to questions now.
[Reclaimer?] Waiting for SQ42 artists to free up.
[Resell baseball caps?] No plans. There are some Big Benny's shirts coming though.
They've got some cool Star Citizen lanyards to give away at Gamescom and CitizenCon
[Argo comes with Pods?] There are three different pod options, two will be ready.
[Phoenix flyable?] Not yet. They have some other base ships to update first – Aurora, 300, Cutlass. After those are done they'll do variants. When Chris Smith rebuilt the Connie one of the reasons it took so long is that they built it around the idea of easily switching to variants. Won't be another 8 months for the phoenix once it's time.
No price yet for the Argo. With it being attached to 2.5, they can't give a week's notice, but they'll let us know when they can.
[Argo fit in Carrack?] Fit questions are hard till both ships are built. When they size things out in concept, it's an educated guess.
[Cat's weaponry?] Probably wait for the hangar sale.
[Grabby hands?] No updates to report, it's not Ben's bally wick. Grabby hands was a concept that Calix Reneau put together to deal with cargo stuff, but it wasn't the only concept. There's some exciting stuff in that ballpark that they can't talk about yet.
[RtV and fancave?] It's probably gonna come back, but they're experimenting. They're down a Hennessy today.
Gamescom! It's in 5-6 weeks. Very close. They have their very first real deal official show-floor booth this year. It's been an adventure putting it together apparently. The artwork for the booth is the Idris, the demo stations'll look like command stations on an Idris. They just thought it's cool, why not make it look like an Idris. They debated between the Idris bridge and the Idris flight-deck. They apparently looked into renting the Midway for an event. The issue was they couldn't begin to set up till 4pm, and they had to be done and off the boat by 11. Window was a little too short. But they wanted to have an event on the deck of the Midway. Maybe another time, but they also couldn't get Internet.
Lots of cool stuff coming for Gamescom. They've got a station to stream, they'll be bringing out some livestreamers from the SC community, they'll be demoing the latest builds of Star Citizen, etc… They'll do ship giveaways and more. In the evenings there'll be bar citizen type events.
Full day tickets to Gamescom are sold out, but there are afternoon passes for 6 euro's which give access from 2pm onwards.
[What's happening with AtV?] Things are up in the air. Right now they like rotating between each studio, so each studio can have some pride in what they're showing. Instead of getting four 2 minute segments, now you get a full 8 minutes dedicated per studio. With rotating, they have weeks to pull together footage, make it look better, etc…
Disco has gone to pick up a package that just arrived.
Ben is now in charge. He can't read questions from where he is, so he's gonna free-verse.
Things are exciting. Good mood in the office, lots of progress. 2.5 is looking good. Grimhex, flyable reliant. They've worked on the next concept sale brochure, cool idea for this one we'll hear more about shortly. And now Justin has shown up.
Justin has become Jared. Justin is reading questions.
[How will you top this week's AtV?] NO idea. It was a good one. They pulled out all the stops. But there are a million cool things coming.
Jared's back.
Disco apparently has bad scissor credit, whatever that is.
They're opening the package. Disco is reading a very long letter. There's a second letter. Disco has a Big Benny bear. The bear is now on top of the camera. I can see nothing else, except ben's blurry face I think the bears were sent by Davidian? This has turned into a bear-centric RtV … Still on the bears.
They'll play pick a bear with others later. Back to the show, maybe?
[Zane talked about in-game Star Map in AtV. What about sector map when quantum jumping?] They're working on a new in-game interface for that stuff. What you see in Crusader right now is temporary. It was necessary to start building Crusader, but it's not final, like most UI stuff. It's initial implementation.
[With more clothes soon, will we be getting han-solo UEE style jacket?] Isn't that the legally distinct from firefly jacket? the duster? But yes, we'll be getting it, just don't know when. They did just have a talk with Behaviour about fulfilling some things like that though. They have a list of posters and ship models that have to be finished.
[Will GrimHex be an armistice zone like Olisar?] Unsure. Disco asked yesterday but didn't get an answer yet.

Top transfer target Kevin de Bruyne has been warned off a move to Manchester City - by one of the club's own players.
The Blues have been linked with the Belgian midfielder all summer with rumours rife of a £35m bid before the end of transfer window.
And Edin Dzeko has had his say on the saga - however remarkably, he appears to have to advise the Wolfsburg star to stay where he is.
The Bosnian striker himself moved to Manchester from the German giants after in 2011 after winning the Bundesliga title.
And he reckons De Bruyne may benefit from another season as the talisman at his former side.
He is quoted as telling German website Kicker: “A lot of players who excelled in other leagues have had problems here -- take Angel Di Maria.
“I'm certain that he (De Bruyne) has what it takes to play for one of the top clubs in Europe but he's also aware that at these clubs there are 20 top players who always want to be on the pitch.
“Maybe it would also help him if he plays in the Champions League with Wolfsburg this season and takes another step in his development there.”
De Bruyne, who last season provided the most assists in Europe last term and helped Wolfsburg achieve a second place finish and German cup win.
The 24-year-old previously had an unsuccessful two year spell at Chelsea where he barely featured before being sold.
Dzeko said: “Kevin has an advantage,” he said.
“Through his time at Chelsea he knows the Premier League and knows that it's completely different.

Dzeko has been linked with a move away from the Etihad, with Roma said to be keen on taking the striker to Serie A.
Sonos oozes simplicity: all your music, all your services, all over your house, all from one place. But its app has always lagged behind, a cluttered blue list of services that made it needlessly hard to actually find what you were looking for. Today, Sonos aims to fix that: it's launching version 5.0 of its controller app, which attempts to finally make finding music to play as easy as it is to play across your house.
Available for Android today and iOS this spring (desktop controller updates are coming later), the app is designed around search: you can search for an artist, song, or album, and Sonos looks for it across all its many services. (Just in case you're a happy paid subscriber of Rdio, Spotify, Pandora, Rhapsody, Deezer, TuneIn, and iTunes all at once.) The interface is remarkably simpler, a tabbed white interface that looks like almost any other music player in either app store. It's not exciting, but it's a huge improvement.
A gigantic music library, finally easy to navigate
You can control multiple rooms at once, each playing different songs from different services or all completely in sync. There's some discovery built in, too, hopefully making it easier to find new music as well. The app of course supports the same huge list of services as always, and the same social and alarm features. The app's not an overhaul of what Sonos does, but rather how it does it.
2014 has already been a big year for Sonos: it ran a memorable, colorful Super Bowl ad, and hired Microsoft's Xbox chief Marc Whitten as its new chief of product. Even if version 5.0 of the controller app is the last thing the company has in store for this year (and it probably won't be), it's a pretty good note to end on.
My Fastest Program for Building Muscle and Ripping Off Fat
When I'm hired to get an athlete, bodybuilder, or actor into the best shape of his life – to strip him of virtually all body fat while adding 15 to 20 pounds of functional "show" muscle – I have hundreds, maybe thousands, of protocols I can use to help him reach that goal.
But if I'm also given the added challenge of a quick deadline – where I have a limited amount of time to give him that amazing look of power – there's only one type of training to use: star complexes.
No. Not those complexes. Not the ones you've read about so many times. I'm talking about real complexes. Not only that, I've taken the idea of complexes to a whole new level.
Soviet-Style Complexes for Bodybuilding
If you're familiar with complexes, you've been mislead. Rather, you haven't been told the whole story.
First, wipe your memory of what you think a complex is. You know, standing in one place with the same bar, going through a series of exercises without stopping, usually with a light weight. We used that type of method when I was an Olympic weightlifter. We called it a warm-up.
Real complexes originated in the Soviet Union. Later, Dr. Donald Chu wrote about this "secret" training method and used it to prepare athletes for three different Olympics.
Complexes are simply blocks of exercises. The Soviets used only two exercises in their complexes – one strength-movement and one power/explosive movement. The idea was to work both extremes of the strength curve.
My former football coach who later became my mentor introduced me to the idea. He'd have us do back squats and then, immediately after, perform jump squats. It's the same movement pattern, just working different capacities.
It was an incredibly effective training method and I've been experimenting with it for years. Today I use complexes with every athlete I train at one point or another. Complexes allow you to work on power, strength, and speed, while building some appreciable mass in the process.
I've now perfected the method, and the results my clients are getting are nothing short of shocking. My version of complexes is simply this: a shortcut to the coveted power look.
Thibaudeau Star Complexes
I've taken the concept of complexes and ramped it up. Instead of training only two points on the force-velocity curve, I train around five points, which is why I call them star complexes.
Each complex will use five exercises of the same movement pattern. The five exercises will be performed back to back, starting with a heavy/slow movement as the first exercise. Each subsequent exercise will be lighter in resistance than the previous exercise, allowing for progressively faster rep speeds.
Don't worry, you don't have to "get it" now. I'll provide easy-to-understand examples a little later on.
Explosive Fat Loss!
This progressive method creates a powerful metabolic effect that's incredible for fat loss, especially when combined with short rest periods. Although short enough to keep an elevated heart rate, these rest periods shouldn't be so short that they decrease performance. Fat loss is further increased with the addition of a strength-endurance movement at the end of the complex.
Most of my fat-loss complexes consist of two heavy movements and three explosive movements. The reason? Explosive movements have a more profound effect on fat loss than slow movements. A complex that has three explosive movements by itself is going to be efficient for fat loss. Add a strength-endurance movement at the end and it's even more effective.
And remember, the faster you can train without having a decrease in performance, the better it is. Explosive work increases insulin sensitivity in the muscle tissue more than any other type of training. If you overemphasize the eccentric action, you decrease insulin sensitivity. In fact, intense eccentric work can decrease glycogen re-synthesis for up to 36 hours and that's a killer!
So, by having mostly explosive movements, you sensitize the muscle cells to insulin, which leads to less storage of fat. This is followed by a powerful increase in catecholamines that results in further energy expenditure and keeps the metabolic rate elevated for a few hours after the workout.
Finally, there's the sheer calorie burn from performing big movements. Your muscle is like an engine; the bigger it is the more gas you burn. Big movements mean big calorie burn.
Four Types of Movement Patterns
I carve up the body's actions into four basic movement patterns:
Deadlift Squat Overhead press Bench press
Each complex targets one of these movement patterns, and you'll be performing two complexes per day, paired like this:
Day Complex A Complex B Monday Overhead Press Squat Tuesday Deadlift Bench Press Thursday Squat Overhead Press Friday Bench Press Deadlift
Perform the 5 exercises in Star Complex A as a circuit, resting 30 to 90 seconds between each exercise Complete 4 to 6 rounds of the complex, depending on your goals and capabilities. Rest for as long as it takes you to set up Star Complex B. Perform the 5 exercises in Star Complex B as a circuit, resting 30 to 90 seconds between each exercise. Complete 4 to 6 rounds of the complex, depending on your goals and capabilities.
Maximizing Results with Peri-Workout Supplements
Complexes can be used for several goals: fat loss, strength and power gains, and building high-performance mass. You name it, complexes can do it! However, I've designed this specific program for maximum fat loss while gaining as much muscle as possible, so my workout supplement protocol will reflect those goals.
You need to understand, just because you're in a fat-loss phase doesn't mean that you can't grow stronger and pack on muscle as well. I've trained several bodybuilders who broke personal records a week prior to a contest. And this is after weeks of hardcore dieting. To maximize results, especially when training at this level, you simply have to load up on these high-tech nutrients during the peri-workout period.
Here's my recommendation for maximum results:
Supplement Amount Plazma™ 3 servings Mag-10® 2 servings
Drink half of the Plazma™ 15-20 minutes pre-workout, and the remaining half at the mid-point onward.
Thirty minutes after your workout drink Mag-10®.
Eat your regular meal 60 to 90 minutes after the workout.
What Kind of Results Can You Expect?
I've seen dramatic results time and time again.
I've seen hockey players dropping 5% body fat in five weeks without changing their diets. I've seen fitness girls losing 20 pounds of fat in six weeks while getting stronger. And I've seen football players completely revamp their body composition in six weeks while adding 20% to some of their lifts!
Complexes, performed in this fashion, work. For any body type. For any goal. They're that powerful. They're one of my best "secrets." And now, the secret is all yours. Get to work.
6 Weeks to Superhero Program
Deadlift Star Complex
Exercises Load Types Reps 1 Top-half deadlift Overload 3 - 5 This first exercise is your heaviest, and the top-half movement will allow you to use more than your limit strength in the standard deadlift. Start with the bar just above the knees. Good for activation and building your traps and upper back. 2 Deadlifts from floor Strength 3 - 5 Moving up a notch in the force-velocity curve, this is a heavy deadlift, but not super maximal. The speed of movement should be faster than the previous exercise. 3 Power clean from hang or blocks Strength-Speed 2 - 3 Moving into the strength-speed portion of the curve. Focus on explosion, not on the load used. If you start from blocks it's better for starting explosive strength (e.g. sprint start) and if you start from the hang it's better for movements where you have to quickly switch from eccentric to concentric (e.g. running and jumping) 4 Jump good morning Speed-Strength 8 - 10 This exercise is a speed-strength movement, so it should be loaded but light enough so that you can accelerate. A load of 20% of your max good morning is adequate. 5 Broad jump series Explosive 8 - 10 This is a reactive or plyometric movement. Each rep should be a high quality jump and very explosive. Start off by doing each rep individually, and as you become better at it you can do them as a series with minimal transition between the jumps.
Squat Star Complex
Exercises Load Types Reps 1 Top-half squat Overload 2 - 5 This movement is both a great neural activator and a very effective quadriceps movement. The top-half of the squat is done mostly by the quads. 2 Front squat Strength 3 - 5 For this complex I prefer the front squat over the back variation because the posterior chain and lower back were already heavily hit by the deadlift complex. 3 Power snatch from hang or blocks Strength-Speed 2 - 3 Doing this powerful movement from blocks focuses on explosive starting strength, like that needed for a sprint start. In contrast, the hang variation is more transferable to movements where you have to rapidly switch from eccentric to concentric, like in running. 4 Jump squat with bar Speed-Strength 8 - 10 Do this one with a minimal dip down, a quarter squat, no more. Keep the torso as upright as possible to focus on quad explosiveness. A load of 20% of your max squat is adequate. 5 Vertical jump series Explosive 8 - 10 Do a short and quick dip then reverse the motion as fast as you can. The transition from dip to jump should be lightning fast 6 Backward sprints with sled or Prowler Work Capacity 1 Keep a crouched position (knees bent at 90 degrees), and sprint backward for 30 meters. This will be hell on the quads, especially the vastus medialis.
Overhead Press Star Complex
Exercises Load Types Reps 1 Top-half seated overhead press Overload 2 - 5 Start just above the weak point of the movement so you can use a lot of weight while still having enough of a range of motion to stimulate the pressing muscles. 2 Standing military press Strength 3 - 5 I prefer the standing variation over the seated because of its greater postural involvement. Make sure to squeeze the glutes hard during the whole pressing movement. 3 Push press Strength-Speed 2 - 3 Make an effort to create a "shoulder shelf" to push from by resting the bar on your deltoids at the beginning of the movement. Use a slight leg drive to get the bar past the weak zone while driving hard with your arms. 4 Medicine ball push-press throw overhead Speed-Strength 8 - 10 This is a very effective speed-strength exercise for the upper body. Focus on pushing equally with both arms, as most will tend to use only one arm. The motion is similar to a basketball pass, but overhead. 5 Feet elevated plyo push-up Explosive 8 - 10 No need to drop your chest all the way down. Just as in jumping, we want a short and rapid dip and minimal transition time before the projection upward. Stop when you lose your "pop."
Bench Press Star Complex
Exercises Load Types Reps 1 Top-half bench press Overload 3 - 5 This is a very effective activation movement for the rest of the complex, but it's also one of the most effective triceps exercises you can do! 2 Bench press Strength 3 - 5 Focus on keeping the traps shrugged up when doing this movement (for added safety, stability and raw performance). 3 Speed bench press, as fast as possible with 60% of max Strength-Speed 5 Focus on two things here: 1) move as fast as possible (accelerating throughout the movement) with 60% 1RM, and 2) perform a quick turnaround between the lowering and lifting phase. 4 Medicine ball chests throw Speed-Strength 8 - 10 You can either perform this one standing and throw it in front of you, or lying on your back and throw it straight up. If you do the latter, make sure to throw it straight up or have a partner catch it for you! 5 Plyo push-up Explosive 5 - 10 No need to drop your chest all the way down. Just as in jumping, we want a short and rapid dip and minimal transition time before the projection upward. Stop when you lose your "pop."

Bentley Yoder was born with his brain outside his skull. Doctors said he didn't have a chance, but he not only survived—he thrived. Now, some seven months later, Bentley has undergone reconstructive surgery to move his brain back into his skull.
Advertisement
Bentley's parents, Sierra and Dustin, both 25, found out something was wrong when they went in for a routine ultrasound at 22 weeks. Still in the womb, he was diagnosed with a rare condition called encephalocele, or cranium bifidum, in which parts of the brain protrude outside of gaps that have formed in the developing skull. The parents were told that their baby likely wouldn't survive very long after birth, or that if he did he wouldn't have any brain function; he was simply “incompatible with life.”
As Sierra told the Washington Post, “We had no hope whatsoever.” The parents were unwilling to terminate the pregnancy, saying they wanted at least one chance to meet him before saying goodbye.

To virtually everyone's surprise, Bentley came out on his due date, October 31, 2015, kicking and screaming. After the first 36 hours, Sierra and Dustin had to take him home wearing the only onesie they bothered to purchase. Over the course of the next few weeks and months, Bentley continued to march on, save for a staph infection in his lungs.
Aside from the large sac containing critical parts of his brain atop his head, Bentley developed normally. He continued to grow, and cried when he was hungry. The doctors were incredulous, and insisted that the growth above his head was just “damaged tissue,” and that “there's no way it could be functioning,” but Bentley's behaviors and normal developmental trajectory suggested otherwise.

When Bentley turned four months, Sierra and Dustin took him to the Cleveland Clinic where a surgeon agreed that the infant was using his brain, but warned that it may not be possible to put it back in the cranium.
From there, they sought out Dr. John Meara at Boston Children's Hospital, whose surgical team sees a few cases of severe encephalocele each year. After taking a look at Bentley, the surgeons realized that the parts of his brain located within the pouch could not be removed because they were responsible for cognitive functions such as motor control, problem-solving, and vision. The brain had to go back in, so they developed a plan.

Using 3D-printed models, the surgeons planned out and practiced the pending procedure. Bentley had 100 cubic centimeters of brain outside his skull, so the surgeons had to expand his cranium to accommodate it. Before the surgery, Meara had the benefit of working with a plastic model, which he sliced-up, and then sent back to the lab to assess how much more brain matter his team could fit inside the skull.
On May 24, the surgery began. This date was carefully chosen because Bentley's skull was sturdy enough to withstand the surgery; any later, however, and the encephalocele might rupture. The first step was to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from Bentley's brain. The surgeons made further cuts into the cranium, and then gently eased the brain back into his head. Leftover bone from the cuts were used to close the gap. The whole thing took about six hours. The surgery went well, though Bentley had to return for a pair of follow-up procedures to add a shunt and to drain excess fluid from his brain.

Nearly a month after the surgery, Bentley appears to be doing fine, but no one can be sure what his future holds. It's quite possible that his vision is impaired, but it's not clear to what degree. He will begin physical therapy next month. “Because of how different his brain really is, [we] have no one to compare him to,” Sierra told WaPo, adding, “We just have to take it step by step.”
[Washington Post, STAT]
Margaret Thatcher was adamant officials should not publicly name Sir Peter Hayman, a senior diplomat connected to a paedophile scandal, even after she had been fully briefed on his activities, examination of formerly secret papers released to the National Archives shows.
The 37-page file includes numerous handwritten notes and annotations by the late Conservative prime minister. It also reveals that security services were not initially informed about Hayman's proclivities, as a secretary forgot to pass on a message to the relevant official and police neglected to follow up the matter.
The densely typed documents, which are available for view to the public for the first time on Tuesday, also describe how Hayman, who died in 1992, apparently arranged for “obscene correspondence” to be sent to the British high commission in Ottawa when he was the most senior diplomat there. A member of domestic staff at the mission was wrongly blamed at the time for the letters, which were sent to a false female name.
The file, compiled between October 1980 and March 1981, is made up of memos and background notes put together for Thatcher, then prime minister, and is littered with her handwritten notes, underlinings and crossings out.
The existence of the file was revealed by Sky News last month. On Friday the Cabinet Office announced it had reviewed the decision to keep the file secret beyond the standard 30-year deadline and was releasing it to the National Archives in Kew. A preview of the file was issued to the media.
The details of the treatment of Hayman's case will be of interest to campaigners seeking justice for the victims of historical sex abuse, whose cases will be considered by an inquiry commissioned by the home secretary, Theresa May.

A number of the files refer to decisions by Sir Michael Havers, then the attorney general. May's original choice of head for her inquiry, Lady Butler-Sloss, is the sister of Havers, and stepped down after victims and their families objected.
In a three-page document from 17 March 1981 titled Sir Peter Hayman – Background Note, unnamed legal officials explain why Hayman was not prosecuted when, three years previously, police discovered he was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange group, who sent indecent material to others by post and had sexual fantasies about children.
The note explained Hayman had been only on the periphery of inquiries into PIE, and that there was no evidence of his having sought to approach any child for sexual purposes, or his seeking to incite others to do so, meaning he was not prosecuted. None of the other eight people involved in the correspondence was prosecuted, it added. At a subsequent Old Bailey trial involving more senior PIE members, the note adds, Hayman was referred to as a “senior civil servant”, not to protect him, but because he was not a witness and none of the defendants knew his identity.
The memo ends: “It is the policy of the law officers that persons who have been investigated by the police but not prosecuted should not be named in the House [of Commons], as to do so is to cast an unnecessary slur on the person without his having the opportunity to clear his name before a court.”
Thatcher amends this paragraph to cross out “in the House”, indicating that she did not believe Hayman should be named anywhere. She also strongly underlined the word “slur”.
All this effort was for nothing. The next day, 18 March 1981, a Conservative MP, Geoffrey Dickens, used parliamentary privilege to ask in the Commons if the attorney general “will prosecute Sir Peter Hayman under the Post Office Acts for sending and receiving pornographic material though the Royal Mail”, prompting an official response from the attorney general, Havers, which named Hayman.
Thatcher's insistence on not naming Hayman appeared always unlikely to succeed. The retired Stowe and Oxford-educated career diplomat had come to the attention of police in 1978 when a package containing sexually explicit correspondence was found on a London bus, addressed to a Mr Henderson, the pseudonym Hayman used within PIE. Police raided his flat in west London and found 14 years' of journal entries detailing his fantasies, many involving children.
The director of public prosecutions decided that Hayman and his co-correspondents should not be charged, but after he was anonymously referred to in the subsequent PIE trial, the magazine Private Eye ran a story detailing what had happened and naming him. Other newspapers, among them the Guardian, then also named Hayman before Dickens's question in the Commons.
The file shows that prior to the Private Eye article, in October 1980, Thatcher and her officials had no idea that police had even investigated Hayman. More worryingly, neither had the security services, amid fears he could have been blackmailed by foreign powers.

A briefing note from October 1980 from Thatcher's private secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, gives her a rundown on what had been swiftly learned about Hayman, noting that before the revelations he had seemed “to all appearances a healthy, normal and happily married man”.
Hayman had taken part in sexual activities “with consenting adults (of both sexes)”, Armstrong told Thatcher. However, any material related to children “appeared to be all fantasy”. The memo noted that it was “clear that Sir Peter Hayman was already engaging in sexual perversion in 1966 when he returned from Berlin to the Foreign Office, and it must be presumed that he was doing so before that time”. This was, in retrospect, a big security risk at the time, he added.
While he was high commissioner in Ottawa, Armstrong wrote, “There was a problem of obscene correspondence addressed to a fictitious female name at the high commission, apparently as a result of advertisements placed in a pornographic magazine.” He added, drily: “At the time this was laid at the door of a member of the domestic staff; the latest report raises the question of whether it should have been laid at Sir Peter's door.”
He advises Thatcher to say publicly that it remained to be investigated why Hayman's “character defect” had not been uncovered by vetting processes. He added: “The fact is that none of us – neither the Cabinet Office, nor the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, nor the security service – knew anything about the affair until the article [was] published, and I doubt whether there is any point in trying to conceal this fact.”

A later background note, apparently from March 1981 but not dated or signed, explains why the security services were not told, as police or prosecutors should have done when someone so prominent and potentially open to blackmail was involved.
“An attempt was made to contact security services when the first police report was under consideration,” it read. “The contact was unavailable and his secretary said he would ring back – but he did not do so. Later, the final decision not to prosecute was reached and the need to chase the unreturned phone call was overlooked.”
As it transpired, no security implications were found, something Thatcher also took a keen interest in. In a note to her the day after Dickens's Commons question, titled “line to take”, she scribbles her own semi-legible verdict on what should be said. “Say authorities have carried out an investigation,” it orders. “Nothing to suggest that security prejudiced.”
Reid, Obama oppose independent commission on torture Agence France-Presse
Published: Thursday April 23, 2009
Print This Email This The White House and its top US Senate ally poured cold water Thursday on hopes of creating an independent commission to probe harsh Bush-era interrogation techniques widely seen as torture.
Lawmakers escalated their feud over who knew what, and when, and where, as well as what to do about the people who planned, justified and used tactics like the near-drowning known as waterboarding on suspected terrorists.
And there was fighting over whether the methods approved by then-president George W. Bush had produced intelligence that helped foil plots, or whether information could have been obtained with traditional questioning.
The White House pointed to increasing hostility between Obama's Democratic allies and his Republican critics as evidence that the president was right to say Tuesday that he would not champion the creation of a special commission.
"I think the last few days might well be evidence of why something like this would likely just become a political back and forth," said spokesman Robert Gibbs, who stopped shy of flatly opposing assembling such a panel.
"By (definition), an independent commission would probably not be something that I would weigh in on if Congress were to create one of those," he told reporters.
He spoke after Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he opposed talk of an independent probe at least until the Senate Intelligence Committee concludes its investigation into the interrogations and produces a public report, perhaps "sometime late this year."
"I think it would be very unwise, from my perspective, to start having commissions, boards, tribunals, until we find out what the facts are. And I don't know a better way of getting the facts than through the Intelligence Committee," said Reid, senator from Nevada.
He spoke as Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who reportedly favors creating a special commission, said lawmakers briefed on CIA interrogations were never told the agency was using the harsh methods.
"We were not, I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used," said Pelosi, one of the eight senior lawmakers who attended the classified briefings.
Pelosi said the briefers told lawmakers in the highly secret sessions that they had legal advice that the methods "could be used, but not that they would."
Republican congressional officials immediately pointed to a December 2007 Washington Post report that Pelosi was among a handful of key lawmakers to whom the CIA's special program and new tactics were disclosed in 2002.
And House Republican Minority Leader John Boehner declared that "all of this information was downloaded to congressional leaders of both parties, with no objections being raised."
Reid told reporters he had received "a number of briefings" over the years on the tactics being used and said: "When I disagreed with what was given to me, I raised those objections."
After talks at the White House, Boehner said he had pressed Obama to release classified documents detailing the results of harsh questioning and said the president was "examining whether to release this information."
The White House did not immediately comment, but Gibbs earlier said it was impossible to know whether information collected through harsh methods might not have been gathered through traditional interrogations.
"People will tell you that there was information that was procured that was helpful, and information that was procured that was made up. Nobody could ever likely tell you that any information derived couldn't also have been derived from another mean," he said.
The feuding came after a blizzard of disclosures -- including memos detailing the kinds of methods used, a timeline of CIA interrogation decisions, and a Senate report detailing how harsh interrogations became currency at Guantanamo Bay then spread to Afghanistan and Iraq.
Escalation could imperil Obama's legislative agenda, especially in the Senate, where the Democratic majority needs support from at least a few Republicans to ensure passage of major bills.

ANGE Postecoglou's World Cup planning has been thrown into chaos after a year-long dispute over Mark Bresciano's transfer to Qarar exploded back into life.
The veteran midfilder, expected to be cast as the cornerstone of Postecoglou's blueprint for Brazil, learnt on Friday that he had been fined Euros1.3m and suspended for four months over the circumstances of his transfer from the UAE to Qatar last year.
The dramatic development left Football Federation Australia lawyers scrambling over the weekend to ascertain the likely timetable of Breciano's appeal against the sentence, which threatens to derail his hopes of playing in next year's World Cup.
News_Rich_Media: Mark Bresciano has been banned by FIFA for four months for an illegal transfer. Unless Bresciano wins the appeal, he could be banned for the World Cup or at least the leadup to it. Tom Smithies broke the story and joins us to discuss the implications.
Though Bresciano has been cleared to play for Australia on Tuesday against Costa Rica by FIFA, it remains unclear what his staus will be while the appeal is heard - or when that will be.
Bresciano has also taken legal advice, after being assured in July last year that his switch from UAE side Al Nasr to Qatari team Al Gharafa was legal.
Reports at the time said he had bought out the second year of his contract, but Al Nasr were adamant he had to stay with them after a season in which he had finished top scorer.
His new club Al Gharafa has been banned from making any transfers for a year, though yesterday they insisted it was a matter for the player and his previous club.
Despite knowing his dream of playing in a third World Cup was under severe threat, Bresciano completed a full training session with the Socceroos yesterday and stayed behind to sign autographs for fans, before climbing on the bus with the rest of his teammates.
News_Rich_Media: Ange Postecoglou joined the team on the couch as he discussed his plans for the Socceroos.
News_Rich_Media: Socceroos veteran Mark Bresiano stressed there is no discussion about the captaincy among the squad, but says Lucas Neill has every right to fight for the captain's armband.
Brecsciano joined Al Gharafa last July, 12 months after quitting Serie A to play out his football in the Middle East, later saying the move had reignited his love for the game.
Al Nasr appealed to FIFA over his departure and this week the world governing body handed down the swingeing penalty, telling Al Nasr that they are entitled to compensation.
Al Gharafa have appealed against the verdict to the Court of Arbitration in Sport but unless it is heard by the early part of next year, Bresciano faces the prospect of being suspended during, or at the very least for the entire build-up to, next year's World Cup.
FIFA's appeals procedure is notoriously slow moving, both in terms of scheduling hearings and delivering a verdict.
Unless Bresciano's appeal is heard successfully realistically by the end of January - or after next year's World Cup - the ban will all but rule him out of the tournament in Brazil.
In a statement, Al Gharafa's general secretary, Jassim Al Manosuri, insisted the Qatari side were an innocent party.
"This is not a unique case, there are many precedents, we as a club are not a part of this case," he said.
"As the player ended his contract with his former club before joining us, our next step will be filing an appeal to the court of arbitration for sport."
Football Federation Australia said it was taking legal advice. "We will do all we can to assist Mark Bresciano and his representatives in having the judgement swiftly overturned and set aside," an FFA spokesperson said.
"The advice from FIFA is that the suspension doesn't apply to Tuesday night's match against Costa Rica. Marco is available for selection and will continue his preparations with the squad."
Education Minister Hekia Parata is not considering a review of the law allowing religious instruction in state schools.
Christchurch mother Tanya Jacob, along with the Secular Education Network (SEN), is leading a fight against the Education Act sections that permit volunteers to teach religion after her son felt discriminated against and was made to wash dishes for opting out at his school. They are asking for a review of the Act.
Parata said she was not considering a review of the Education Act .
"I'm more concerned to ensure that parents have the opportunity to express their views." It was up to individual boards of trustees to decide whether religious instruction was offered to pupils, and members were chosen through a democratic process.
"Parents have choice. If they don't want to have their children going to a school that offers that, then choose another school." Christianity was where the country's "traditional history" came from.
"The country as a whole at a public national level still has a view about the place of that in our society." She predicted the role of religion in education could eventually change, as the population "decides that that is what it wants to happen".
It would have to be a problem among a majority of schools before she considered any kind of review of the ability for schools to provide religious instruction.
Labour education spokesman Chris Hipkins said religion in schools was a "vexed area" and he would be open to a review.
SEN spokesman David Hines said the people being hurt by bibles in schools were often in a minority. "But that's what human rights is about, caring for minorities." Christianity was being taught as superior to other religions, and that people with no religion were morally inferior.

Thousands of environmental activists formed a human chain at a controversial open cast mine in western Germany on Saturday, demanding that the country accelerate its transition to clean energy and end its use of coal.
Some 3,000 people, including environmentalists, Green party members and local residents formed the 1.2 mile (2 km) long chain to send a message to RWE, the German energy giant, that it could come "this far and no further."

RWE wants to extract a soft, brownish form of coal known as lignite, to burn in German power plants.
Dressed in red, environmental groups like the German Federation for the Environment and Conservation of Nature (BUND) said that given the rapid acceleration of global warming the country's transition to clean, carbon-free, sources of energy needs to accelerate, too.
"We need a law for the phasing-out of coal, we need structural measures for the people, for the region, jobs and a push for the switch to green energy," BUND head Hubert Weiger said ahead of the demonstration in the village of Kerpen-Mannheim, about 18 miles (30 km) west of Cologne.
Plans call for renewed mining of lignite from the site beginning in 2023 at the massive Hambach mine in Elsdorf.

Green's join the chain
In addition to the BUND and regular citizens, politicians from Germany's Green Party also joined the chain, as did members of Greenpeace and the German Environmental alliance (Umwelt-Allianz Deutschland).
"We have experience with the German government that a start to the phase-out of coal will not be possible," Weiger said, demanding that the subject top the agenda of the next government after the general election on September 24.

Polls show Chancellor Angela Merkel and her right-of-center Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party leading in opinion polls about 15 percent.
Weiger warned that if the federal state where the mine is located doesn't dramatically reduce the amount of lignite that is burned Germany will not be able to meet its climate change obligations.
The human chain is one of many protests that began on Friday and were scheduled to continue through Tuesday. On Friday, activists managed to disrupt RWE's operations to the extent that the company had to curtail production at one of its power plants.
The activists also set up blockades in various locations on Saturday. Police vehicles were attacked with slingshots and firecrackers from the cover of neighboring woods during the night. But there were no injuries reported.

When people move long distances to foreign environments or start new jobs, they are faced with a world of new experiences and challenges. For NBA rookies, their situations are no different.
In this year's draft, the Kings selected three players in the first round—Georgios Papagiannis, Malachi Richardson and Skal Labissiere. Halfway through their initial seasons as NBA players, they have experienced the ups and downs that accompany life as a rookie.
For starters, the game is different than what they've been accustomed to.
“Learning, relearning everything pretty much,” Labissiere said of the biggest adjustment he's made since entering the League. “It's a different game up here.”
Young players have to learn how to play with NBA vets, often faster and stronger than them thanks to years of strength training and conditioning. Richardson's biggest adjustment from Syracuse to the NBA reflected the difference in physical abilities.
“Just picking up the speed and strength of everybody,” the rookie guard said. “Guys jump a lot higher, and guys are a lot smarter on the floor.”
Unlike his fellow first-round picks, Papagiannis entered the NBA with European as opposed to NCAA experience under his belt. Even though he has played professionally in Greece, Papagiannis shared similar sentiments to Labissiere and Richardson about transitioning into the Association.
“The first thing is the playing style is really different than I used to play last year,” he said of his most noticeable adjustment since coming over from Greece. “Here, the game's more physical, faster. When you get to the first practice, you realize you're in the best League in the whole world.”
Rookies like Richardson, Labissiere and Papagiannis are constantly trying to soak up as much information from all sources, including veterans. Richardson credits his time around other NBA players for accelerating the learning curve.
“Being around these guys, you pick up on different, small things that you actually need to improve yourself,” the 21-year-old said.
Off the court, the rookies have also had to adapt as well. Richardson spent his life on the east coast, going to college in Syracuse after growing up in New Jersey. Labissiere, meanwhile, was born in Haiti, played high school in Tennessee and college ball at Kentucky. Papagiannis was born in Greece and spent nearly all his life there before moving to Sacramento.
For the three rookies, part of adjusting to life away from home has been learning to live without some of their favorite foods. The big man from Greece finds himself craving gyros, one of the most iconic dishes from his country. Richardson, on the other hand, misses proper New York style pizza - something he has yet to find in Sacramento.
“It's different than back home,” Richardson said.
Lifestyles also change for rookies entering the NBA. After living in the structure of college, filled with classes and study halls taking up the bulk of their time off the court, Labissiere and Richardson were both astonished by how much freedom they now enjoy.
“How much free time I have on my hands,” Labissiere said of his biggest surprise of life as an NBA player. “I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my free time, whenever I'm away from basketball.”
While simultaneously adjusting to life off the court, the rookies have improved their play. When they've had chances to play more minutes, they've been able to capitalize on opportunities. As the season has progressed, so have the Kings first-year players.
When Richardson has played with the Bighorns this year, he's been one of the best rookies in the D-League. Earlier this year, he was top five in scoring among rookies with double-digit appearances and shot 44 percent from long distance. He averaged 9.5 free throw attempts as well, which was most among rookies with at least 10 appearances.
After starting the season with the other first-year players, bouncing to and from the Bighorns, Richardson has recently broken into Coach Dave Joerger's rotation and played meaningful minutes.
Papagiannis has had an up-and-down start to his NBA career, but he has seen development as he's gained more experience.
“I improved my body,” he said of his biggest area of growth so far. “I've lost a lot of weight right now. That's really helped me.”
His analysis on his game looks to be correct, as he's scored double digits in his last six outings in Reno. In a stretch that began in early December, Papagiannis has averaged 11.6 points per contest. His redefined physique has allowed him to bang down low with the able-bodied big men of other teams.
“I've been in the weightlifting room every day, so I can keep up with the physical game,” Papagiannis said.
Like the Greek center, Labissiere has shown significant development since December, too. As time has gone on, his comfort has increased and led to sharpened production.
“Just a better feel for the game,” the Haitian-born big man cited as his biggest improvement so far.
In Reno, Labissiere has scored double figures in 13 consecutive games. He had four double-doubles over his last nine, including two straight to date. He is able to contribute defensively, averaging 1.3 blocks per game.
The up-and-downs of a season can be tough for NBA rookies. But for this particular batch, they wouldn't trade it for anything.
Richardson has loved embarking on his NBA journey: “It's been awesome so far, just being able to wake up and go to work, and being able to play the sport that I love and I've been playing my whole life.”
Papagiannis felt the same: “It's the greatest feeling for me to be here and be playing in this League.”
Halfway through their first years as pros, the rookies seen growth in life both on and off the court.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian prosecutors called on Tuesday for Kremlin critic and protest leader Alexei Navalny be jailed for 10 years as they appealed against a suspended sentence he received last year in a theft case, arguing it was ‘too soft'.

Navalny and his brother Oleg were convicted last year of stealing 30 million rubles - nearly $500,000 at the current exchange rate - from two firms, including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher.
Both were given 3-1/2-year jail sentences. Oleg is serving his time in jail, while Navalny, who led street protests against Vladimir Putin in 2011-12, was given a suspended sentence.
“We demand that Navalny be sentenced to 10 years in jail,” state news agency RIA quoted a prosecutor as saying at the appeal at Moscow city court.
The Navalny brothers were found guilty of defrauding companies by overcharging them for mail and parcel services provided by their business from 2008 to 2011.
Oleg allegedly used his position as a senior manager in Russia's Post Office to attract customers for his mail company, of which investigators said Navalny was registered as the founder.
Other Russian news agencies cited the prosecutor's statement as saying that Navalny's suspended sentence was “excessively soft” and that the brothers had to be isolated from society.
Although Navalny, who also campaigns against corruption, has little chance of mounting a serious challenge to Putin, he has promised to lead 100,000 people on March 1 in protest against policies he says are leading Russia deeper into economic crisis.
After the brothers were sentenced on Dec. 30 last year, Navalny said Putin's “regime” had to be destroyed. Hours later, he violated the terms of his detention by cutting off his house arrest tag to attend a rally of supporters who had gathered near the Kremlin to protest his trial.
At the Moscow city court, Navalny, who says the case against him is an attempt by the Kremlin to stifle dissent, said prosecutors' demands were “not based on the law and are not worth reviewing”, Interfax news agency reported.
The U.S. State Department called last year's sentencing a disturbing development “designed to further punish and deter political activism”.
Putin's popularity ratings have soared since the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea territory and what Russians see as the leaders' tough stance against the West over eastern Ukraine.
But Navalny, who dubbed his March 1 protest an “anti-crisis” rally, hopes to tap anger over a faltering economy expected to contract this year in the face of falling oil prices and Western sanctions.

Drudge Report Readers Choose Ted Cruz, Rand Paul in 2016 Presidential Poll
Drudge Report readers in a recent poll were asked which Republican presidential candidate they would pick for 2016.
Rand Paul ended on top of the poll with 30.91 percent of the vote (72,277 votes), followed by Ted Cruz with 28.33 percent.
The other candidates were pretty far behind. Jeb Bush was next with 6.30 percent.
After him was Sarah Palin (5.24 percent); Chris Christie (4.87 percent); Rick Perry (4.33 percent); and Mike Huckabee (3.73 percent).
Bobby Jindal, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum, and Donald Trump were also choices in the poll, in which over 230,00 votes were cast.
Other recent polls include a straw poll at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference, which also saw Paul on top with 31 percent of the vote and Cruz in second with 11 percent; and a straw poll of conservatives by the founder of ConservativeHQ.com which saw Paul on top with 29 percent and Cruz in second with 17 percent.
Christie, the current governor or New Jersey, got in third in both of those polls.
With the Christmas season coming, or is it already here, I thought it would be fun to do some lists relating to Christmas: Ten Gingerbread Houses You Would Live In…Then Eat. The witch's house in Hansel and Gretel has nothing on these confectionery structures.
Gingerbread Whore House
Few gingerbread men will admit a visit to this house of ill repute located on the “other side” of Candyland, across from the Molasses Swamp. Gramma Nutt, from Candy Land fame, still runs the place and makes sure every gingerbread man gets his gumdrops off. The gingerbread girls are the sweetest and were baked anatomically correct, with ginger in all the right places if you know what I mean.. Photo by by REDPhotography
Gingerbread Mansion
This gingerbread family was doing something right financially. They finally made it to the top and are living in their dream gingerbread mansion. At least until the government finds out about the illegal immigrant Bizcochitos (Mexican Christmas Cookies) they hired. Photo by OR4N6E
Gingerbread English Brownstone
This gingerbread brownstone home was recently declared an historic landmark and avoided being condemned or digested. Even though it had been des(s)erted, except for the occasional homeless gingerbread man, the city made every effort to keep it from being eaten, I mean torn down. Photo by olwen jones
Gingerbread Victorian House
Like most Victorian gingerbread homes, this one is haunted. As the story goes, a former gingerbread man who owned this gingerbread house lost his head when he fell head first into a milk bath by accident. Knocked unconscious, his head slowly disintegrated, turning the milk bath into a sickly brown liquid. The police on the scene said he was delicious. His headless gingerbread ghost still makes the rounds searching for his lost noggin, or so they say. Photoby ineedathis
Gingerbread Mill House
A clever twist on the “ordinary” gingerbread house, the Gingerbread Mill, which produces, yep you guessed it…ginger. There are cruel rumors that this is really just a front for a ginger sweat shop, won't somebody please think of the children? Photo by ineedathis
Gingerbread Log Cabin
This builder made a delicious and “green” decision to build a gingerbread log cabin. His heating bills will be much lower this year. He was used to living in an oven, so he likes it extremely warm. Photo by olwen jones
Gingerbread Bridge
This gingerbread bridge allowed the gingerbread families to save 20 minutes off of their daily commute from the candy land countryside. This replacement bridge still serves as a reminder of the horrible gingerbread bridge collapse of 1883. Some 30 gingerbread souls perished. More were baked soon after, so it's cool.
Gingerbread Town Homes
Luckily these gingerbread townhome owners all get along, even while being right on top of each other. A family of “odd smelling brownies” tried to move in, but the owners association stepped in and had the offending treats removed. Thank goodness. Photo by pocket pastry chef
Brick-a-brack Gingerbread House
The housing market in this area has hit rock bottom and while a gingerbread home like this used to sell for just under a 2 million chocolate chips, you'd be lucky to get 1 million chocolate chips today. We need to get the gingerbread men and women working again. Yes, we can!
Gingerbread Country Cottage
Every gingerbread man dreams of retiring to the countryside and living out his sugary life in a quiet cottage among the friendly borders of the Lollipop Woods. Candyland prices are skyrocketing, so buy now.

Troy
When Tom Nardacci was starting his own public relations firm, Gramercy Communications, he began by working out of his house.
The barking dog in the background really didn't give off a professional impression when Nardacci was on the phone with potential clients.
And when he tried to work out of the local coffee shop, he found it was often too loud, and that a seat could be hard to find.
When it comes to high-tech startups in the Capital Region, there are plenty of "incubators" willing to sign up tenants that work in a collaborative setting, from Schenectady to Albany and Troy.
But when it comes to the creative economy — the region's sixth largest employment sector — Nardacci said nothing similar exists locally, or anywhere in upstate New York.
That's why Nardacci is planning to spend $1 million on a rundown building at 22-24 Fourth St. in downtown Troy. He calls his new concept the Troy Innovation Garage.
Nardacci says that everyone from the freelance writer to the web designer and the social media promoter will be able to walk in and rent space in the office, either for just the day or on a longer-term basis. There will also be conference rooms and meeting rooms, and Gramercy is going to have its headquarters in the middle of it all, helping startups and aspiring "solopreneurs" as Nardacci calls them, grow their businesses.
"It's going to have a retail mind set," Nardacci said. "It's going to be an open door here."
Nardacci says he already has a handful of startups looking to become tenants, although he declined to name any of them. He secured financing from Pioneer Bank and is working with 3tarchitects of Troy and Jeff Buell of Sequence Development on the design. The two-story building, which has housed a restaurant, a dance studio and a bank call center over the years, will be completed by this time next year.
City of Troy officials are thrilled, believing that the "Garage," as it's being called, will help provide a nurturing environment for fledgling businesses that will eventually need more space downtown.
Monica Kurzejeski, Troy's economic development coordinator, says Troy's resurgence downtown is based on many startups, from restaurants to video game companies, whose owners have worked together to help one another. She sees what Nardacci is doing as an extension of that.
"Now, Tom is paying it forward," Kurzejeski said. "It works with the vibe of downtown Troy's business community. It's tremendous."
Erin Pihlaja, executive director of the Troy Business Improvement District, called the Garage a "game-changing investment" for the city.
Nardacci is also going to commit $250,000 toward a special "residency accelerator program" that will provide director support to select tenants that get accepted to the special support program, designed to help early-stage businesses get off the ground.
The Fourth Street location that Nardacci is buying is in the middle of about $50 million in investment coming into the city by way of developers, schools like Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and other infrastructure development, such as the proposed new transit center at the intersection of Fourth and Fulton streets. The location is between Franklin Plaza and Proctor's Theater and is near the new location of the Tech Valley Center of Gravity at the Quackenbush Building.
"I really think the Innovation Garage's success is going to be based on this growing community," Nardacci said.

Google's biggest event of the year, Google I/O in San Francisco, was interrupted twice today by two protesters with very different messages. One protester, an unidentified man (seen above), stood up in the audience late into Google's keynote speech during a discussion of the company's cloud platform and began yelling about killer robots. "You all work for a totalitarian company that builds machines that kill people!" the man shouted, pointing his finger at the stage where Google's senior VP of technical infrastructure Urs Hölze was speaking. "You know that's true," the protester added, before being escorted out of the Moscone Center venue by security.
Earlier, another woman protester whose identity has yet to be confirmed began shouting in the middle of Android engineering director Dave Burke's talk. She held up a T-shirt that read "develop a conscience, stop Jack Halprin," as seen in the photos above and below. It doesn't appear at this time that the protests were directly related
Halprin, a Google attorney who wasn't onstage at the time, has been the target of protesters before. In April, demonstrators assembled outside Halprin's seven-unit home in San Francisco's trendy Mission neighborhood, protesting his alleged eviction of all other six tenants from the property. At least two of the tenants said they were local teachers in San Francisco, as the SF Examiner reported at the time.
At I/O today, Halprin's protester was quickly escorted out by security, and Burke seemed mostly unfazed by the disturbance. He later joked about the incident, saying the new Android version L's battery-saving feature would be good for the protester: "Maybe you're taking a long hike, or maybe a long protest."
Update June 25th, 3:54PM: A Google spokesperson did not comment specifically on the actions of the protestors, but offered the following statement:
Standing with the Standing Rock Sioux, over 1,200 museum directors, archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians—people "familiar with the long history of desecration of Indigenous People's artifacts and remains worldwide"—have written to the Obama administration to denounce "further irreparable losses" that would accompany completion of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.
Spearheaded by The Natural History Museum, the letter, sent this week to President Barack Obama, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and the Army Corps of Engineers, notes the destruction caused earlier this month by the company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, when it razed recently discovered burial sites, prayer sites, and other artifacts.
It "adds yet another injury to the Lakota, Dakota, and other Indigenous Peoples who bear the impacts of fossil fuel extraction and transportation," the letter states.
Indeed, stated signatory James Powell, former president and director of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum and former president of the Franklin Museum of Science, "What the Standing Rock Sioux are going through is just one example of a systemic and historical truth around how extractive and polluting infrastructure is forced upon Native communities."
"We stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and affirm their treaty rights, tribal sovereignty, and the protection of their lands, waters, cultural and sacred sites, and we stand with all those attempting to prevent further irreparable losses.""It is long past time for us to abandon fossil fuel projects that harm Native communities and threaten the future of our planet," he added.
The water protectors fighting the pipeline, which would stretch over 1,100 miles from the Bakken fields in North Dakota to southern Illinois have already seen an outpouring of solidarity in the U.S. and beyond. And though on Sept. 9 the administration called for a temporary pause to the construction—a decision recently affirmed by a federal appeals court—the pipeline's "future is far from certain," and there's been no commitment from the Army Corps to make a full environmental impact statement.
From the letter:
Many of us put countless hours into developing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) to prevent burial desecration of this type, yet the pipeline was approved without a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and the cultural resources survey did not involve proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other tribes in the region. SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Help Keep Common Dreams Alive Our progressive news model only survives if those informed and inspired by this work support our efforts
The destruction of these sacred sites adds yet another injury to the Lakota, Dakota, and other Indigenous Peoples who bear the impacts of fossil fuel extraction and transportation. If constructed, this pipeline will continue to encourage oil consumption that causes climate change, all the while harming those populations who contributed little to this crisis. We call on the federal government to abide by its laws and to conduct a thorough environmental impact statement and cultural resources survey on the pipeline's route, with proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. We stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and affirm their treaty rights, tribal sovereignty, and the protection of their lands, waters, cultural and sacred sites, and we stand with all those attempting to prevent further irreparable losses.
Of course, Powell and the other signatories may not be the usual band of suspects one expects to hear from regarding a fossil fuel infrastructure project—and that's noteworthy.
"The signers of this letter are far from your typical activists," said Beka Economopoulos, director of The Natural History Museum. "It speaks to the critical nature of this issue that museum directors and scientists, who don't often engage in political struggle, have made the decision to raise their voices about the Dakota Access pipeline. The significance of the cultural artifacts along the pipeline's proposed route is simply too great to sacrifice for a fossil fuel pipeline that would threaten not only these artifacts, but also land, water, tribal sovereignty, and the climate."
Writing this week about the fight to stop the pipeline, environmental activist and essayist Chip Ward posited that "America's Manifest Destiny, that historic push across the Great Plains to the Pacific (murdering and pillaging along the way), seems to be making a return trip to Sioux country in a form that could have planetary consequences."
"Perhaps it's time to finally listen to and learn from people who lived here sustainably for thousands of years. Respecting Sioux sovereignty and protecting the sacred sites of tribes in their own co-managed national monument could write the next chapter in our American story, the one in which the Indians finally get to be heroes and heroines fighting to protect our way of life as well as their own," Ward wrote.
The full letter can be seen here.

Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, says the government budget forecasts are so unrealistic they will need updating if the opposition wins the election
Labor has promised to produce a mini-budget within three months of being sworn in, saying the government's budget forecasts are so unrealistic they will need updating to avoid a AAA credit downgrade.
Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, says Labor would also want to update the budget early in its term to put its “stamp” on the economic agenda quickly, and it does not want to wait until May next year to produce its first budget.
It means Labor will publish a mid-year economic and fiscal outlook within three months of being sworn in – if it wins the election – with the forward estimates projections updated to reflect Labor's policies, including its savings measures and its “investments in schools”.
Bill Shorten makes education a priority as Labor 'underdogs' hit campaign trail Read more
Bowen will make the announcement at the National Press Club in Canberra on Tuesday, during the shadow treasurer's reply to the budget.
It comes a day after the election campaign officially began, which Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten both spending the day in Queensland.
It has been a rocky start for both major parties.
Liberal MP Dennis Jensen – who lost Liberal Party pre-selection before the election – announced on Monday he would re-contest his seat of Tangney as an independent. Labor's candidate, in the seat of Melbourne, publicly disagreed with Labor's asylum seeker policy.
Bowen says Labor wants the Parliamentary Budget Office to take control of all economic forecasts in future budgets, because that will finally ensure they are produced “at arm's length” from the government.
He criticises treasurer, Scott Morrison, for relying on overly-optimistic assumptions to show the budget returning to surplus in the future.
He will also claim the Coalition's plan to deliver large tax cuts for big business is reckless, saying the government was so embarrassed by the $50bn cost of its tax plan that it tried to keep the centrepiece of its budget “in the witness protection program”.
“The government lectures us that investments in schools and hospitals should be paid for. We agree. But the Government can't claim that it can't afford a $37bn investment in schools over the next decade but an unfunded $50bn corporate tax cut is just fine,” he says.
Bowen says Moody's rating agency gave the Turnbull government “two clear warnings” last week when it reviewed the Commonwealth budget – to adopt measures like the ones Labor is proposing, or risk losing the AAA rating.
Campaign catchup: election 2016 is off with a bang, a bus and a box of melon Read more
He says Australia's AAA rating is now under real pressure, and the treasurer, in “doggedly insisting” that Australia doesn't have a revenue problem, is endangering Australia's AAA rating.
“In an economy where confidence is low and the Reserve Bank has repeatedly expressed concerns about the lack of investment, losing one or all the AAA ratings would be a real body blow to confidence,” he warns.
He says Morrison's budget appears to lay out a pathway to surplus, but almost the entire return to surplus is built on assumptions and projections about the economy, “not on decisions to alter the direction”.
“All of these forecasts underline the reason why I announced here at the National Press Club eighteen months ago that the Parliamentary Budget Office, independent of government, will produce the underlying economic parameters in the budget,” he says.
“This will ensure that economic forecasts are undertaken at arm's length from Government giving the public more confidence in the Budget process.”
Moody's warned last week the government's budget projections for nominal gross domestic product growth – the key to shrinking the deficit – were too optimistic.
“We estimate that constraints on the ability of the government to reduce spending amid moderate nominal GDP growth will lead to somewhat wider deficits for longer than currently budgeted,” Moody's said.
YCRS and Legal Ride team up for riding clinics in Las Vegas, talking about the skills necessary to survive and thrive in a 24-hour city with low grip and distracted drivers. Thanks to YCRS coach Mark Boedecker for the help.
My friend Damon Shuetze runs Legal Ride in Las Vegas, Nevada, a law firm that handles motorcycle accidents and hosts riding-technique clinics. At a recent clinic, I told the group that research shows many of our accidents are in intersections hitting other vehicles, and on back roads by ourselves. Damon stepped forward and added, “But we're seeing more riders getting rear-ended at traffic lights these days.”
And we all know why: drivers are distracted by cell phones (GPS, texting, e-mail, actual phone calls) while driving. Rather than rant about this messed up situation, this column will offer riding tips to help you survive around drivers who are blind and deaf to almost everything beyond their phones.
Mindset
Since I started street riding in 1977, the common advice has been, “ride as if everyone is out to hit you.” Great advice and even more applicable 40 years later. It should lead you into moving through blind spots and positioning yourself in other-drivers' mirrors when possible. This common advice should help you choose bright colors for your gear and ride with your high beam on most of the daylight hours. If the driver gets a chance to look away from their phone screens for an instant, you must be visible in your gear and in their mirrors.
Riding in this paranoid frame of mind should have you covering the brakes in crowded situations, but also covering the horn button. It should have you flashing your brake light at stops, but also flashing your brake light every time you are slowing with just engine braking. Those flashes just might catch the eye of the texter behind you, but if they don't, learn to watch in your mirrors at stops and have an escape alley if the caller doesn't realize traffic ahead has stopped.
Divorce your riding mindset from your emotions. Don't let the texters' mistakes get personal. John L. Stein wrote a great article (MOTORCYCLING AS CHESS: One-Percent Faster) about approaching riding in traffic like a chess game, looking and planning and watching and reacting proactively. Rather than get angry, learn to “laugh and marvel” at the ineptness around you as you move through the bumbling throngs relegated to a hellish life of cars and cell phones.
Decide right now to never get angry in traffic again because we cannot win a shoving match with a car. YouTube is littered with videos of incensed riders who lost an argument with an equally-incensed but more-heavily-armed car driver. “Laugh and marvel” and move along on your transportation device that brings joy, freedom and the spirit of youth.
You must learn the signs of distracted driving. They include, but are not limited to:
Unexplained slowing. Well, not truly unexplained, right? The cell phone rings or buzzes or beeps or chirps and the right foot lifts while the eyes search the coffee-stained cup holders in a frenzy of self-importance. Hmmm…do I sound cynical on this subject? Must remember to “laugh and marvel.” No turn signals because the hands are busy steering with one finger and texting with the other nine. Car stays motionless when the light turns green. Tough to send emojis AND accelerate…not that they noticed the light color anyway. This “green light texting delay” is actually a great opportunity for the alert rider to make his or her way forward in the fray, kinda like when a racer stalls their bike on the grid: “Thank you for the improved finishing position; see ya!” Driver head angle stays slightly down and forward, no scanning or apparent interest in surroundings. They could be watching a good movie on their phones. That is a lot of fun, but when you see this motionless, forward leaning head angle, know that you are the lowest actor on this driver's priority list. Stay clear.
Skills
You've got to be able to stop and steer your motorcycle efficiently. I've written about how to practice stops on this website, and have seen firsthand how beneficial a little bit of weekly practice can be. Did I write “beneficial?” Sorry, meant to write “life saving.” Practice on every bike you have.
Stopping distances include reaction times, so learn to cover your brakes in traffic. Ride in a gear that gives you instant acceleration to clear jams. If you ride a small bike in traffic, don't get caught with your rpm too low when you need a burst of acceleration to get through a blind spot or past a problem. But remember to flash your brake light (foot tapping on the rear brake pedal does a good job of this) when you decelerate at those higher revs because the driver on the conference call behind you needs that visual warning. Remember, most modern cars have automatic transmissions, so the concept of compression braking is completely lost on the 2017 driver. Flash your brake light when decelerating.
